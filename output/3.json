    "abstract": "Lattice structures are widely used in lightweight structural components and energy absorption parts. While topology optimization addresses desirable density distribution in lattice structures, there is yet no definitive solution for finding an optimum lattice layout. Since load path analysis can reveal the most efficient route for load transfer, it is preferable to align the lattice trusses with load paths for optimal structural performance. In this work, U* load path analysis is used to tailor the unit cell geometries of body-centered cubic lattice structures. The lattice layout is first determined by stiffness lines and potential lines derived from U* field in the design domain. The truss diameters are then numerically optimized to generate the lattice structure with functionally graded properties. This methodology is validated by a design problem of a cantilever structure. Results from finite element simulations and experimental tests on specimens fabricated by selective laser sintering demonstrate that the U* graded design has a significantly higher specific stiffness and strength compared with the benchmark design with a uniform cell arrangement. This approach enables engineers to create new design concepts of lattice structures with the integration of physically determined load paths.",

    "abstract": "Compared with conventional formwork casting materials, 3D printed concrete (3DPC) is characterized by large amounts of cementitious materials, a low aggregate–binder ratio, and a large water evaporation area, which make the printed materials and structures highly prone to plastic shrinkage and cracking. In this study, cellulose fibers were incorporated into concrete to improve its moisture distribution and increase its early-age strength. The effects of both dry and prewet cellulose fibers on properties of 3DPC were experimentally investigated. To ensure consistency in the amounts of dry fibers used, 0.5–2% dry cellulose fibers and 1–4% prewet cellulose fibers were adopted. The effects of the added cellulose fibers on printability, mechanical strength, shrinkage, and cracking performance of the 3DPC were experimentally studied. Particularly, a constraint method was developed to access the cracking behavior of 3DPC. Favorable shrinkage resistance was achieved, and the 120-day shrinkage decreased by 17.9% and 23.3% by addition of 2% dry fibers and 4% prewet fibers, respectively. Cracking was eliminated with addition of 4% prewet fibers, without influencing the printability and mechanical properties.",

    "abstract": "This work evaluates the potential for foamable polymer filaments to be used to make lightweight, energy-absorbing structures using additive manufacturing. To achieve this, a commercial, foamable polylactic acid filament was extruded using a material extrusion process to make parts for compression testing. It was found that a maximum foam expansion could be achieved at an extrusion nozzle temperature of 220°C, but that to achieve dimensional accuracy, the material flow rate through the nozzle had to be adjusted by decreasing the extrusion multiplier value. In a novel approach, accurate and faster builds could be achieved by decreasing the infill instead. When compared with porous structures achieved by using partial infilling instead or as well as foaming, all materials were found to follow the same power-law function of the solid fraction. These trends indicated that the mechanical response was, within experimental scatter, a function of the overall solid fraction and not influenced by whether the porosity was within or between the raster lines. Although there was no apparent benefit to the mechanical performance in introducing porosity into a polymer by foaming, foamable filaments are desirable if stiff, lightweight structures with low fractions of interconnected porosity are required and can be used in combination with infilling to produce low-density structures that would be highly suitable for cores in novel lightweight sandwich structures.",

We present the case of concentrating solar power (CSP) with molten salt (MS) thermal storage, where low-cost, high-efficiency heat exchangers (HXs) are needed to achieve cost competitiveness. The materials required to tolerate the extreme operating conditions in CSP systems make it difficult or infeasible to produce them using conventional manufacturing processes. Although it is technically possible to produce HXs with adequate performance using additive manufacturing, specifically laser powder bed fusion (LPBF), here we assess whether doing so is cost-effective. We describe a process-based cost model (PBCM) to estimate the cost of fabricating a MS-to-supercritical carbon dioxide HX using LPBF. The PBCM is designed to identify modifications to designs, process choices, and manufacturing innovations that have the greatest effect on manufacturing cost. Our PBCM identified HX design and LPBF process modifications that reduced projected HX cost from $750 per kilo-Watt thermal (kW-th) ($8/cm3) to $350/kW-th ($6/cm3) using currently available LPBF technology, and down to $220/kW-th ($4/cm3) with improvements in LPBF technology that are likely to be achieved in the near term. The PBCM also informed a redesign of the HX design that reduced projected costs to $140–160/kW-th ($3/cm3).",

The associated conformal cooling application is already commonly used where there is a need to improve the quality of castings, increase tool life, or reduce the production cycle. However, will this technology withstand the production of a large part (∼270 × 270 × 200 mm), which will be used directly in the serial production of engine blocks? This article describes a slider with a conformal cooling case study, which was redesigned and manufactured using the laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) method. After the slider was put into serial production of 1.0 TSI three-cylinder engine blocks, this tool was thoroughly monitored based on the temperature field by comparing the results of a simulation in SW ProCAST with reality, and furthermore examining the influence of the tool on the quality of castings. There was also an evaluation of repairs performed on the tool in the ŠKODA AUTO tool shop and the foundry. These data were compared with a serial tool. Finally, the costs to produce the slider in conventional and 3D-printed variants are compared with an outline of other possible steps for optimizing these costs. The study results show that relatively large parts can be printed and used in serial production even today. It was also confirmed that conformal cooling influenced improving tool life, and the number of repairs in ŠKODA AUTO production also decreased.",

Both OPA designs have 3-μm waveguide spacing and the maximum beam steering range is about 30° based on wavelength tuning around 1550 nm. The first generation had 37 channels with 108 μm of waveguide array width and the second generation had 512 channels with 1.5 mm array width. As the array outputs are edge coupled, suitable lenses are required to collimate the beam vertically. We report the comparison between a commercially available straight cylindrical lens and custom 3D printed curved cylindrical lenses. In the experiments, we demonstrate 1D beam steering of the light outcoupled from the waveguide facets and collimated by these lenses and analyzed parameters such as Rayleigh range and beam divergence. These parameters are estimated to be 9.9 mm and 7.0 mrad (0.4°), respectively, for the commercial lens, whereas 40.1 mm and 3.5 mrad (0.2°) for the dedicated 3D printed lens, showing a clear improvement.",

    "abstract": "Aging, tooth trauma, and pathological infections cause partial or total tooth loss, leading to the usage of dental implants for restoration treatments. As such, mechanical and tribological properties play an important role in the osseointegration and durability of these implants. Metallic and ceramic implants are shown to have mechanical properties much higher than the natural teeth structure, leading to stress shielding-related failure of an implant. Stress shielding occurs due to the difference in the elastic modulus between the implant material and the surrounding teeth structure, leading to bone loss and implant failure. The implant's properties (i.e., mechanical) should be as close as human teeth components. To achieve this, various materials and coatings are being developed and investigated. This review is a comprehensive survey of materials, manufacturing, coating techniques, and mechanical and tribological characterizations of dental implants, with a particular focus on polyetheretherketone (PEEK) as a potential alternative dental implant material. PEEK has mechanical properties similar to natural teeth, which make it a promising material for dental implants. The findings of this review suggest that PEEK offers superior biocompatibility, osseointegration, and wear resistance for implant applications. With the help of bioactive coatings, bone growth on the implant surface can be promoted. In addition, PEEK dental implants made using three-dimensional (3D) printing technology can significantly reduce the cost of implants, making them more affordable and increasing access to dental care, which can improve oral health significantly. In summary, this review highlights the potential of PEEK as a promising alternative dental implant material, and provides an overview of various techniques, testing, and future directions for PEEK dental implants.",

Therefore, this article investigated the effects of three different chemical polishing processes on the surface state, pore structure, and mechanical properties of small pore size scaffold materials at different polishing times in the field of implantable medical devices. The results show that the overall treatment effect of the simple chemical polishing process is poor, the internal treatment depth of porous support is insufficient and uneven, and the overall mechanical properties of the sample with the same porosity are average. The outer structure during the electrochemical polishing process showed an obvious treatment effect. However, the internal treatment depth and uniformity were significantly lower compared with the simple chemical polishing process, and the overall mechanical properties of the sample with the same porosity were inferior. The overall treatment effect, depth, and uniformity of the inner and outer structure of the sample using a dynamic chemical polishing process were significantly optimized, and the overall mechanical properties of the sample with the same porosity were superior to the other two methods. Furthermore, the main reasons for the nonuniform treatment effect between the inner and outer layers during the chemical polishing of porous scaffolds were observed to be related to the restricted exchange of etchant caused by the complex internal structure of porous scaffolds and the gas generated by the chemical reaction.",

However, uncertainties in 3DP/AM processes and material attributes could cause geometric and structural quality issues in resulting builds and products. Evaluating the sensitivity of process parameters and material properties for process optimization, quality assessment, and closed-loop control is crucial in practice. This study presents a framework for a nondestructive in situ real-time ultrasonic monitoring approach based on the temporal and spectral dispersion analyses of specially designed artifacts with periodic internal structures called Phononic Crystal Artifacts (PCAs). The framework's effectiveness for in-situ monitoring of laser beam power in a Selective Laser Melting (SLM) process is experimentally demonstrated. A PCA is significantly simpler and/or smaller than the actual build, but it represents a specific subset of its geometric and mechanical features and complexities, which are relevant to the objectives of a quality monitoring program. Specifically, the influence of the SLM printer laser beam power on the ultrasonic responses and dispersion properties of stainless steel 316L PCAs is evaluated. Two sensing strategies based on cross-correlation and spectral dispersion analysis of ultrasonic waves transmitted in the artifacts are presented and utilized for evaluating the effect of laser power level on the mechanical and microgeometric properties of fabricated PCAs. The reported novel framework's potential in critical quality monitoring applications for in-situ real-time quality assessment of 3DP/AM processes is also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Spectrophotometers allow a user to measure the concentration of a colorful and/or light scattering solute (e.g., proteins, dyes, or cells) by illuminating a sample and then measuring how much light is transmitted through the sample to a detector. However, despite the relative simplicity of this technique, most commercially available spectrophotometers cost thousands of dollars. The goal of this work was to design and optimize an open source photometer that utilizes inexpensive components (LEDs, resistors, and an Arduino) and customized 3D printed parts (a flow cell or cuvette holder) to measure the absorbance of both dynamic liquid streams and static batch samples. Specifically, the device uses an LED to illuminate a sample with specific wavelengths of light that are either absorbed by the sample or transmitted to a photoresistor. Since the resistance of the photoresistor is inversely proportional to the intensity of light on its surface (e.g., resistance decreases as light intensity increases), the amount of light absorbed by the sample directly determines the voltage across the photoresistor (e.g., voltage decreases as absorbance increases), which can be measured by an Arduino. This circuit was used to construct a novel 3D printed flow cell photometer that can be connected inline to dynamically measure the absorbance of cell cultures, chromatography systems, or other process flows. In addition, the flexibility of this circuit was demonstrated by applying it to a small cuvette holder that analyzes batch samples. The flow cell device was successfully used to measure the concentration of red blood cells in a circulating sample and to detect hemoglobin eluting from a size exclusion column, while the cuvette device accurately measured the enzyme kinetics (Km and Vmax) of a β-galactosidase reaction. In conclusion, these inexpensive ($50–100 each) devices are relatively easy to assemble, program, and use in the quantification of cells, proteins, and small molecules.",

The material system is based on crushed stones (known from the railroad industry) and recycled string. If poured without any containment, the stones naturally form a pile. However, in the case of our JAS, a robotically placed string is applied to confine and transform the bulk material into geometrically differentiated structures at an architectural scale. Since this is a nonstandard material system, a combination of techniques from the fields of architecture and materials science is necessary to, first, understand the material behavior and consequently to inform the processes of design and construction. This article investigates the load-bearing capacities and the deformation of our JAS by presenting results from a series of uniaxial compression tests and fiber-optic measurements. Findings from these tests serve to inform the generative logic of the string layout, which is not only key to the design of our JAS but also responsible for the material properties of the system. The developed methods are validated at an architectural scale through the design and construction of a wall segment loaded with concrete slabs. The presented results prove that the string/stone material system has the potential of becoming an actual load-bearing building material and forms the basis for material-informed design strategies for JAS.",

These materials are now being employed as advanced medical implants due to their extraordinary mechanical properties over traditional devices. Nevertheless, to achieve desired tissue integration and regeneration, it is critical to study how the microarchitecture affects interactions between metamaterial scaffolds and living biological tissues. Based on human induced pluripotent stem cell technology and multiphoton lithography, we report the establishment of an in vitro microtissue model to study the integration and remodeling of human mesenchymal tissues on metamaterial scaffolds with different unit geometries. Microtissues showed distinct tissue morphologies and cellular behaviors between architected octet-truss and bowtie structures. Under the active force generated from mesenchymal tissues, the octet-truss and bowtie metamaterial scaffolds demonstrated unique instability phenomena, significantly different from uniform loading using conventional mechanical testing.",

    "abstract": "The global trend in additive manufacturing is the technology of three-dimensional (3D) printing with a high potential to avoid some of the weaknesses of conventional fabrication techniques. This new technology has been used to manufacture small tidal and wind turbines. In isolated areas, small turbines can be manufactured and assembled on-site for green energy production. The purpose of this document is to evaluate the thermomechanical behavior of a printed tidal turbine using Digimat-AM (Additive Manufacturing) with fused filament fabrication method. The finite element computes the mechanical deflection, temperature, residual stresses, and warpage fields of the printed part. The composites used during printing are thermoplastic polymers (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, polyamide 6 [PA6], polyamide 12 [PA12], and polyetherimide [PEI]) reinforced with carbon and glass fillers in the form of fibers and beads (CF/GF and CB/GB). Through the simulation, one could show that the blade printed with PEI-CB/CF has excellent mechanical performance of low mechanical deflection and warpage, compared to PA6-CB/CF. In addition, the fiber-shaped fillers are better than the bead-shaped ones for the 3D printing process. In general, this study has shown the potential and feasibility of 3D printing as an excellent opportunity in the fabrication of small blades in the future, but more studies are required to understand this potential.",

This process has been used in many areas, including the medical field; however, it seems to represent a new technology regarding vascular models. Although surgical techniques for treatment of aortic aneurysms (AA) have been developed recently, because of its anatomical limitations, complex AAs still remain a challenge. This study aimed to describe the manufacture of 3D biomodels of AA from computed tomography angiography images.Four cases of AA were selected: one abdominal, one thoracic, and the last contained bilateral aneurysms in the common iliac arteries. The images were edited with specific software, which built the 3D images and made them capable of being printed by a PolyJet technology machine. All biomodels represented the aneurysms in life-size dimensions and correctly reproduced their morphology. The average time of manufacture was 18 hours and the biomodels cost, on average, $850. It was demonstrated that it is feasible to manufacture 3D physical biomodels of AA. The utility of these prototypes extends from supporting the surgical planning of the AA, by previously giving the surgeons a panoramic view of the AA, to enhancing the patient's understanding of their diseases.",

To expedite the thermoplastic additive manufacturing process, we propose a parallelized material deposition process called local viscosity control (LVC) additive manufacturing. LVC prints an entire layer in one step by selectively modulating the viscosity of polymer feedstock in contact with a heated wire mesh. Layers of molten polymer are contact printed, with the relative motion between the wire mechanism and a build plate allowing wetting and surface tension to transfer selectively heated, lower viscosity regions of polymer to a fixed substrate. Experiments demonstrate the viability of this process using a single cell depositing layered polycarbonate pixels. Theoretical analysis shows this process may offer similar capabilities in resolution to conventional FDM with a significantly higher production rate for commonly available input power.",

A growing array of native and synthetic circuits such as oscillators, pattern generators, and cell–cell communication systems has been studied, which exhibit spatiotemporal properties. To better understand the design principles of these genetic circuits, there is a need for versatile and precise methods for patterning cell populations in various configurations. In this study, we develop a screen printing methodology to pattern bacteria on agar, glass, and paper surfaces. Initially, we tested three biocompatible resuspension media with appropriate rheological properties for screen printing. Using microscopy, we characterized the resolution and bleed of bacteria screen prints on agar and glass surfaces, obtaining resolutions as low as 188 μm. Next, we engineered bacterial strains producing visible chromoproteins analogous to the cyan, magenta, and yellow subtractive color system for the creation of multicolored bacteria images. Using this system, we printed distinct populations in overlapping or interlocking designs on both paper and agar substrates. These proof-of-principle experiments demonstrated how the screen printing method could be used to study microbial community interactions and pattern formation of biofilms at submillimeter length scales. Overall, our approach allows for rapid and precise prototyping of patterned bacteria species that will be useful in the understanding and engineering of spatiotemporal behaviors in microbial communities.",

In addition, the results of simulation and high-speed charge-coupled device presented that a wedge transition zone, with a length of ∼6 mm, was formed behind the keyhole in the liquid bridge transfer process, where the height of deposited metal decreased gradually.

The simulation and experimental verification were conducted in the form of vertical cylinder using selective laser melting, which was subsequently cut in the middle section. The setup and procedure of simulation approaches followed the actual process parameters such as laser power, layer thickness, scan strategy, and temperature dependent material, including flow curve retrieved from specialized computational numerical software. The investigation began with virtual calibration test using TMM, followed by manufacturing process simulation using ISM. Based on the maximum deformation result of simulated calibration and accuracy consideration from previous equivalent study, the inherent strain values used in ISM analysis were obtained using self-developed optimization algorithm with direct pattern search Nelder-Mead method in finding the minimum error of distortion using MATLAB. The error minima were measured between transient TMM-based simulation and simplified formulation in calculating the inherent strain values with respect to longitudinal and transverse laser directions. Furthermore, the combined TMM-ISM distortion results were compared to fully TMM with equivalent mesh number and verified based on experimental investigation conducted by renowned researcher. It can be concluded that the result of slit distortion from TMM-ISM and TMM showed good agreement with the error percentage of 9.5% and 3.5%, respectively. However, the computational time for combined TMM-ISM was reduced tremendously with only 63 min if compared to TMM with 129 min in running full simulation on solid cylindrical component. Hence, combined TMM-ISM-based simulation can be considered as an alternative method to replace time-consuming and cost-intensive calibration preparation and analysis.",

    "abstract": "Along with the characteristic staircase effect, short carbon fibers, added to reinforce Fused Filament Fabrication parts, can significantly worsen the resulting surface finishing. Concerning this topic, the present work intends to improve the existing knowledge by analyzing 2400 measurements of arithmetic mean roughness Ra corresponding to different combinations of six process parameters: the content by weight of short carbon fibers in polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) filaments f, layer height h, surface build angle θ, number of walls w, printing speed s, and extruder diameter d. The collected measurements were represented by dispersion and main effect plots. These representations indicate that the most critical parameters are θ, f, and h. Besides, up to a carbon fiber content of 12%, roughness is mainly affected by the staircase effect. Hence, it would be likely to obtain reinforced parts with similar roughness to unreinforced ones. Different machine learning methods were also tested to extract more information. The prediction model of Ra using the Random Forest algorithm showed a correlation coefficient equal to 0.94 and a mean absolute error equal to 2.026 μm. In contrast, the J48 algorithm identified a combination of parameters (h = 0.1 mm, d = 0.6 mm, and s = 30 mm/s) that, independent of the build angle, provides a Ra < 25 μm when using a 20% carbon fiber PETG filament. An example part was printed and measured to check the models. As a result, the J48 algorithm correctly classified surfaces with low roughness (Ra < 25 μm), and the Random Forest algorithm predicted the Ra value with an average relative error of less than 8%.",

    "abstract": "Single-step 3D printing, which can manufacture complicated designs without assembly, has the potential to completely change our design perspective, and how 3D printing products, rather than printing static components, ready-to-use movable mechanisms become a reality. Existing 3D printing solutions are challenged by precision limitations, and cannot directly produce tightly mated moving surfaces. Therefore, joints must be designed with a sufficient gap between the components, resulting in joints and other mechanisms with imprecise motion. In this study, we propose a bio-inspired printable joint and apply it to a Single sTep 3D-printed Prosthetic hand (ST3P hand). We simulate the anatomical structure of the human finger joint and implement a cam effect that changed the distance between the contact surfaces through the elastic bending of the ligaments as the joint flexed. This bio-inspired design allows the joint to be single-step 3D printed and provides precise motion. The bio-inspired printable joint makes it possible for the ST3P hand to be designed as a lightweight (∼255 g), low-cost (∼$500) monolithic structure with nine finger joints and manufactured via single-step 3D printing. The ST3P hand takes ∼6 min to assemble, which is approximately one-tenth the assembly time of open-source 3D printed prostheses. The hand can perform basic hand tasks of activities of daily living by providing a pulling force of 48 N and grasp strength of 20 N. The simple manufacturing of the ST3P hand could help us take one step closer to realizing fully customized robotic prosthetic hands at low cost and effort.",

Ultraviolet-cure silicone was deposited via two independently controlled extruders into a thixotropic, gel-like, silicone oil-based support matrix. Each extruder contained a different liquid silicone formulation. The extrusion rates were independently varied during printing such that the combined selectively deposited material contained different ratios of the two silicones, resulting in localized control of material stiffness. Tests to validate the process are reported, including tensile testing of homogeneous cubic specimens to quantify the range of material stiffness that could be printed, indentation testing of cuboid specimens to characterize printed stiffness gradients, and vibratory testing of synthetic multilayer vocal fold (VF) models to demonstrate that the method may be applied to the fabrication of biomechanical models for voice production research. The cubic specimens exhibited linear stress-strain data with tensile elasticity modulus values between 1.11 and 27.1 kPa, more than a factor of 20 in stiffness variation. The cuboid specimens exhibited material variations that were visually recognizable and quantifiable via indentation testing. The VF models withstood rigorous phonatory flow-induced vibration and exhibited vibratory characteristics comparable to those of previous models. Overall, while process refinements are needed, the results of these tests demonstrate the ability to print ultrasoft silicone with stiffness gradients.",

    "abstract": "In the field of nutrition research, the surgical placement of intestinal cannulas in animal models is a commonly used method for assessing nutrient absorption along the digestive tract. This technique allows researchers to obtain intestinal fluid at key checkpoints along the digestive tract. Cannulation studies have been limited by the availability of suitable cannulas for different animal models. This study discusses the creation of a novel cannula that was fabricated using 3D-printed molds and moldable silicone putty. CAD software was used to design the cannula, and 3D-printed models allowed our clinical researchers to assess physical models for suitability. A negative of the final model was created by CAD, sectioned into three pieces to serve as a mold, and then 3D printed. This mold was filled with silicone putty, compressed using vices, and allowed to set. The resulting cannula was removed from the mold and trimmed of excess material to create the final product. These cannulas were then surgically implanted as part of ongoing equine nutrition research. This technique allowed for the rapid development and optimization of custom cannulas, without the prohibitively high costs, expertise requirements, and timeline associated with traditional rubber molding techniques.",

    "abstract": "The manipulation of weaving as a traditional industrial process as a craft, and as a numerically controlled robotic winding procedure, was examined and evaluated through the construction of an architectural scale monocoque shelter. This wound carbon fiber prototypical structure represents a production method for quick deployment, flexibility in form, and lightness of material. The implications of this case study and its future goals are to be explored in relation to the rapid evolution of robotic fabrication and architectural design while being tested through the traditional craft of hand winding as a direct translation of computational information. The methodology and means in which the results are assessed are presented in this study. What is a related and beneficial by-product is the investigation of uniform and continuous winding that fulfills the technical requirements of monocoque and span, while allowing for additive layers of artistry or optical effects (Fig. 1). The oft-converging fields of craft and technology produce novel methods and tools for design, as technology adapts to unforeseen artistic impulse. Simultaneously, these new methods also require a reevaluation of both how art and architectural projects are evaluated.",

Using a regression analysis technique, the main findings are as follows. (i) There is a variation among users' choice of AM application, and the majority of users are expanding their AM applications beyond RP. (ii) There are two factors that positively affect the decision of firms to expand classical RP and incorporate production and management as well. These two factors are using multiple AM technologies (as opposed to single fused deposition modeling technology) being small companies. The authors discuss the implication of these results.",

The printability of the hydrogel based on extrusion-based 3D printing was studied under different mixture ratios of hydrogel components. The appropriate printing parameters and formulas of the hydrogel were investigated to determine the structural strength of printing structures. Furthermore, the shape memory properties of printed structures under different printing conditions were studied. The biomedical applications of the shape memory behavior of printed structures were explored.

    "abstract": "The advent of personalized wearable devices has boosted the demand for portable, compact power sources. Compared with lithographic techniques, printed devices have lower fabrication costs, while still maintaining high throughput and precision. These factors make thick film printing or additive manufacturing ideal for the fabrication of low-cost batteries suitable for personalized devices. This article provides comprehensive guidelines for thick-film battery fabrication and characterization, with the focus on printed nickel-zinc (Ni-Zn) batteries. Ni-Zn batteries are a more environmental-friendly option compared with lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) as they are fully recyclable. In this work, important battery fundamentals have been described, especially terms of electrochemistry, basic design approaches, and the printing technology. Different design approaches, such as lateral, concentric, and stacked, are also discussed. Printed batteries can be configured as series or parallel constructions, depending on the power requirements of the application. The fabrication flow of printed battery electrodes for the laboratory-scale prototyping process starts from chemical preparation, mixing, printing, drying, pressing, stacking to finally sealing and testing. Of particular importance is the process of electrolyte injection and pouch sealing for the printed batteries to reduce leakage. This entire process flow is also compared with industrial fabrication flow for LIBs. Criteria for material and equipment selection are also addressed in this article to ensure appropriate electrode consistency and good performance. Two main testing methods cyclic voltammetry for the electrodes and charge-discharge for the battery are also explained in detail to serve as systematic guide for users to validate the functionality of their electrodes. This review article concludes with commercial applications of printed electrodes in the field of health and personalized wearable devices. This work indicates that printed Ni-Zn and other zinc alkaline batteries have a promising future. The success of these devices also opens up different areas of research, such as ink rheology, composition, and formulation of ink using sustainable sources.",

However, despite recent significant advances in medicine inspired by 3D printing, scientific challenges and regulatory subtleties remain. This study considers additive technology application in radiotherapy. One of the main requirements for 3D-printed samples' use in radiotherapy is the tissue equivalence of the sample material. In this study, selected parameters of 3D-printed samples made of poly(styrene-butadiene-styrene) (SBS plastic) are obtained, that is, effective atomic number, mass and electron density, and Hounsfield units. The obtained parameters are compared with corresponding values for human tissue and organs. Experimental results demonstrate the tissue equivalency of the considered samples, which can be used in different applications in medical physics and radiotherapy. The obtained results have significant importance for the development, design, and production of samples for medical applications using 3D printing.",

The AVM vascular structure was 3D reconstructed from brain computed tomography (CT) data acquired from a patient. For the phantom fabrication, stereolithography was used to produce the AVM model and combined with silicone casting to mimic the brain parenchyma surrounding the vascular structure. This model was made with tissues-equivalent materials for radiology. The hollow vascular system of the phantom was filled with a contrast agent usually employed on patients for CT scans. The radiological response of the phantom was tested and compared with the one of the clinical case. The constructed model demonstrated to be a very accurate physical representation of the AVM and its vasculature and good morphological consistency was observed between the model and the patient-specific source anatomy. These results suggest that the proposed method has potential to be used to fabricate patient-specific phantoms for neurovascular radiosurgery applications and medical research.",

Tests conducted on the test jig were validated against those conducted on conventional testing machines. Analysis of variance was used to investigate the significance of processing parameters (layer thickness, fill density, and speed of deposition) on the mechanical properties. All the test types were observed to be sensitive to changes in processing conditions that affect the interlayer bond strength and hence the quality of the fabricated parts.

Optimization of bioinks as per requirements for specific tissue applications is a critical exercise in ensuring clinical translation of the bioprinting technologies. Most notably, optimum hydrogel polymer concentrations are required to ensure adequate mechanical properties of bioprinted constructs without causing significant shear stresses on cells. However, experimental iterations are often tedious for optimizing the bioink properties. In this work, a finite element modelling approach has been undertaken to determine the effect of different bioink parameters like composition, concentration on the range of stresses being experienced by the cells in a bioprinting process. The stress distribution of the cells at different parts of the constructs has also been modelled. It is found that both bioink chemical compositions and stoichiometric concentrations can substantially alter the stress effects experienced by the cells. Similarly, concentrated regions of soft cells near the pore regions were found to increase stress concentrations by almost three times compared to the Von-Mises stress generated around the region of cells away from the pores. The study outlines the importance of finite element models in the rapid development of bioinks.",

    "abstract": "Laboratory tests in which a fluid or combination of fluids that are injected into a core rock are designed to determine oil reservoir rock petrophysical properties, understand the mobility of fluid flow in the porous samples, and calibrate porous media fluid flow models. The core material is extracted from the oil reservoir. However, the manufacture of core plugs is challenging because of the complexity of extracting natural rocks from the reservoir and their morphological and atypical heterogeneity. In addition, core flooding tests are essentially destructive, making it impossible to achieve experimental repeatability by using identical cores. The use of 3D printing in digital rock physics has permitted the production and replication of synthetic rock samples with the morphological characteristics of natural rocks for core analysis and core flooding tests. This study proposes the 3D manufacture of artificial core plugs from microcomputed tomography of Berea sandstone. The digital samples were constructed using a digital particle packing approach by systematically manipulating rock textural parameters, such as the grain size and shape, cementation pattern, and sorting grain, making it possible to obtain a core plug that fulfills experimental requirements. Before the 3D printing of the sample, the flow distribution through the porous media structure was numerically simulated using the Lattice Boltzmann method to obtain the core plug samples' permeability and porosity. The core plug was digitally embedded within a core holder to generate a stereolithography file for 3D printing of the core flooding setup, which can be used directly in conventional experiments. The permeabilities of the 3D printed plugs were experimentally determined to permit a direct comparison to the numerical results and evaluate the utility of printed plugs for displacement experiments.",

    "abstract": "Porous tantalum (Ta) scaffolds have been extensively used in the clinic for reconstructing bone tissues owing to their outstanding corrosion resistance, biocompatibility, osteointegration, osteoconductivity, and mechanical properties. Additive manufacturing (AM) has an advantage in fabricating patient-specific and anatomical-shape-matching bone implants with controllable and well-designed porous architectures through tissue engineering. The sharp angles of strut joints in porous structures can cause stress concentration, reducing mechanical properties of the structures. In this study, porous Ta scaffolds comprising rhombic dodecahedron lattice unit cells with optimized node radius and porosities of 65%, 75%, and 85% were designed and fabricated by AM. The porous architecture and microstructure were characterized. The compressive behavior and failure mechanism of the material were explored through experimental compression tests and finite element analysis (FEA). Morphological evaluations revealed that the Ta scaffolds are fully interconnected, and the struts are dense. No processing defects and fractures were observed on the surface of struts. The scaffolds exhibited compressive yield strength of 5.8–32.3 MPa and elastic modulus of 0.6–4.5 GPa, comparable to those of human cancellous and trabecular bone. The compressive stress–strain curves of all samples show ductile deformation behavior accompanied by a smooth plateau region. The AM-fabricated rhombic dodecahedron lattice Ta scaffolds exhibited excellent ductility and mechanical reliability and plastic failure due to bending deformation under compressive loading. Deformation and factures primarily occurred at the junctions of the rhombus-arranged struts in the longitudinal section. Moreover, the struts in the middle of the scaffolds underwent a larger deformation than those close to the loading ends. FEA revealed a smooth stress distribution on the rhombic dodecahedron lattice structure with optimized node radius and stress concentration at the junctions of rhombus-arranged struts in the longitudinal section, which is in good agreement with the experimental results. Thus, the AM-fabricated Ta scaffolds with optimized node radius are promising alternatives for bone repair and regeneration.",

Its unique capabilities have motivated emergence of several printing technologies and extensive research in material adoption in particular ferrous-, Ti-, and Ni-based alloys. Meanwhile, the large freezing range and high reflectivity of aluminum, a lightweight structural material, greatly reduce aluminum's compatibility with AM. The incompatibility roots from aluminum's unstable behavior in the rapid cyclic thermal conditions in AM and its poor interaction with laser. This hinders the development of laser-based aluminum AM and deteriorates the existing lack of lightweight structural materials in the intermediate temperature range. Aluminum matrix composites (AMCs) have great potential to serve as thermally stable lightweight structural materials, combining lightweight nature of aluminum matrix and strength of reinforcement phases. However, fabrication of AMC largely uses conventional methods, achieving only moderate volume fraction of reinforcement while having limited part complexity compared with AM.

In this study, according to the characteristics of magnesium alloy, a simple and easy-to-obtain water-based low-molecular alcohol binder was used to reduce the difficulty of magnesium alloy 3DP. Additionally, we use COMSOL Multiphysics simulation software to establish a simulation model of the movement and deposition process of the binder. The results show that the increase in jet velocity will increase the quality and saturation of droplets. More importantly, the larger the jet velocity is, the larger the spreading width of the binder droplet after impacting the powder bed, which seriously affects the dimensional accuracy of the green part. In addition, lower binder saturation will weaken the formation of interparticle bonding neck and cannot form a stable structure. Furthermore, we analyzed the bond reactants of the binder and magnesium alloy powder, which eventually decompose into MgO, and the experimental results show that the final sintered sample has considerable performance.",

    "abstract": "Postprocessing of additively manufactured (AM) metal parts to remove support structures or improve the surface condition can be a manually intensive process. One novel solution is a two-step, self-terminating etching process (STEP), which achieves both support removal and surface smoothing. While the STEP has been demonstrated for laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) 316L stainless steel, this work evaluates the impact of pre-STEP heat treatments and resulting changes in dislocation density and microstructure on the resulting surface roughness and amount of material removed. Two pre-STEP heat treatments were evaluated: stress relief at 470°C for 5 h and recrystallization–solution annealing at 1060°C for 1 h. Additionally, one set of specimens was processed without the pre-STEP heat treatment (as-printed condition). Dislocation density and phase composition were quantified using X-ray diffraction along with standard, metallurgical stain-etching techniques. This work, for the first time, highlights the mechanisms of sensitization of AM L-PBF 316L stainless steel and provides fundamental insights into selective etching of these materials. Results showed that the sensitization depth decreased with increasing dislocation density. For samples etched at a STEP bias of 540 mVSHE, material removal terminated at grain boundaries; therefore, the fine-grained stress-relieved specimen had the lowest post-STEP surface roughness. For surface roughness optimization, parts should be stress relived pre-STEP. However, to achieve more material removal, pre-STEP solution annealing should be performed.",

However, the surface roughness (Ra) of the LPBF sample is unsatisfactory due to the process characteristics of layer-by-layer selective melting and cumulative forming, which limits its applications in the engineering field. Herein, a gradient voltage electrochemical polishing strategy is proposed based on the characteristics of electrochemical polishing technology, which can polish complex structures. The mechanisms of polishing process parameters and polishing strategy on the surface finish of LPBF parts are investigated. The gradient voltage polishing strategy is extended to complex structures, and the Ra of the inner surfaces of square and round tubes are successfully reduced to about 1 μm. The gradient electrochemical polishing process for surface finish post-treatment of LPBF parts can broaden the engineering applications of complex-structure metal parts.",

    "abstract": "Alternative approaches to laser fusion for the additive manufacturing (AM) of metals are often hampered by the need for long sintering cycles. Typical sintering cycles require heating at temperatures above 80% of the melting point for several hours. The process is time- and energy-consuming, particularly when high-melting materials are involved. Applying pressure can drastically reduce the time and temperature required for densification. Recently, a particular kind of pressure-assisted sintering process known as spark plasma sintering (SPS) or field-assisted sintering (FAST) received considerable attention in academia and industry due to its ability to enhance densification. However, conventional SPS/FAST techniques cannot be directly applied to the densification of objects presenting a complex geometry. This work shows how a modified SPS/FAST setup, operating in a pseudoisostatic mode, can be used for debinding and sinter objects produced by material extrusion. This approach can be applied to metals and metal-based and ceramic-based composites when their geometry does not include closed cavities. Depending on the characteristics of the pressure-transfer medium, some level of anisotropy in the volume reduction associated with the densification can be observed. Still, it can easily be corrected by appropriately compensating sintering deformation during printing. Using this approach, the time required for the debinding and sintering can be reduced considerably. It represents an alternative approach to the AM of a wide range of inorganic materials characterized by a relatively low-cost, high material flexibility, and low environmental impact.",

The SLMed microstructural anisotropy resulted in differences in the thermal gradient, grain size, dendrite arm spacing, and tensile properties in the joints under various welding types. Compared with the SLMed counterparts, the laser-welded 304 stainless steel and Inconel 718 joints showed lower microhardness and tensile properties but better corrosion resistance. In contrast, the laser-welded Ti-6Al-4V joints possess a higher microhardness, tensile properties, and corrosion resistance.

However, the poor surface quality of additively manufactured biomaterial is a major limitation. Hence, hybrid-electrochemical magnetorheological (H-ECMR) polishing is developed to improve the surface quality of fabricated parts. H-ECMR finishing is an advanced surface polishing operation that avails the synergic action of mechanical abrasion and the electrochemical reaction to enhance the surface quality of the workpiece without hampering its surface topography. Furthermore, the developed H-ECMR finishing process reduces the finishing time and produces a uniform surface quality compared with the conventional magnetorheological (MR) finishing process. However, the surface finishing of the parts having a hole-of-pocket feature through the H-ECMR finishing process is a major challenge as MR fluid gets trapped inside those holes or pockets. A feature-based hybrid H-ECMR finishing process is developed to resolve the issue. In this case, paraffin wax is applied to the holes and pockets before the H-ECMR process occurs. In the present work, bone plates are fabricated through selective laser melting, and their surface quality is further enhanced through the H-ECMR finishing process.

Yet, higher solid loadings of resins and the resulting dramatic increases in viscosity limit DLP printing for applications that depend upon maximization of filler content. In this work, we investigate the capacity of a bimodal particle size distribution to enable the printing of a photosensitive resin containing up to 70 vol% of fillers. Formulations with unimodal and bimodal solid loadings ranging from 50 to 72 vol% are prepared and their viscoelastic properties measured through rotational rheometry. The zero-shear viscosity of these formulations is fit with a Krieger-Dougherty model, and the dense random close packing fraction of particles determined from the fit is found to be 76.3 vol%. Parts with fine positive and negative features are printed to evaluate the resolution achievable with highly filled photosensitive resins. The part printed with a 70 vol% formulation shows negative features as small as 860 μm, and positive feature as small as 380 μm. Finally, parts with complex patterns are prepared with previously tested formulations, and thermogravimetric analysis results show that the filler content within the parts remains relatively constant over a 3-h print, with a decrease of 2 vol% of solids for the final printed layers.",

Among various 3D bioprinting techniques, extrusion-based 3D bioprinting ensures a higher percentage of cell release, ensuring suitable external and internal scaffold architectures. Scaffold architecture is mainly defined by filament geometry and width. A systematic selection of a set of process parameters, such as nozzle diameter, print speed, print distance, extrusion pressure, and material viscosity, can control the filament geometry and width, eventually confirming the user-defined scaffold porosity. For example, carefully selecting two sets of process parameters can result in a similar filament width (FW). However, the lack of availability of sufficient analytical relationships between printing process parameters and FW creates a barrier to achieving defined scaffold architectures with available resources. In this article, the factorial design of experiment (DoE) method has been adopted to obtain a relationship among scaffold properties that is, FW with 3D printing process parameters. The FW was determined using an image processing technique and an analytical relationship was developed, including various process parameters to maintain defined FW variation for different hydrogels within an acceptable range to confirm the overall geometric fidelity of the scaffold. The validation experiment results showed that our analytical relationship obtained from the DoE effectively predicts the scaffold's architectural property. Furthermore, the proposed analytical relationships can help achieve defined scaffold architectures with available resources.",

Because of the dependency of laser path on the thermal dispersion, it is essential to analyze the heat accumulation phenomenon during laser processing. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis based on the volume of fraction method is used to optimize the laser path for minimizing the local heating up in the PBF process. In this work, a novel spiral laser path with optimal rotation angle is proposed and compared with the commonly used scanning paths. As the results, the accumulated temperature of the optimal spiral path shows a 200.9 K less compared with that of the general repetitive path. The thermal deformation of a cantilever structure made by the optimal spiral path is experimentally evaluated. From the experimental test, we verify that the spiral laser path reduces thermal deformation by 52.3% compared with the one made by the general one-directional laser path. This work based on numerical simulations and experiments utilizes the proposed spiral laser path to obtain higher precision, less residual stress, and more uniform microstructure of an additive-manufactured structure.",

    "abstract": "A bolt joint is a simple element that joins mechanical components. Self-loosening of bolted joints occurs due to the vibrations caused by motors and engines, resulting in the breakage of machines, deterioration of performance, and potentially serious safety problems. Recently, developments in three-dimensional (3D) printing technologies have enabled the fabrication of detailed components. These technologies can be used for producing fasteners using 3D printed bolts. Many researchers have proposed a theoretical model for self-loosening of the steel bolt, and experimental studies on the self-loosening phenomenon have been advanced. However, studies on the self-loosening of 3D printed bolts have not been conducted. Therefore, this study aims to confirm the self-loosening phenomenon and the safety of 3D printed bolts through experiments and finite element (FE) simulation. The self-loosening phenomenon in the cases of transverse vibration of standard M12 × 1.75 × 70 hex bolts made using stereolithography apparatus printer is observed experimentally. A lateral vibration test system is constructed and self-loosening of the bolt is evaluated by observing the axial force according to the vibration cycle by using a strain gauge. This study confirms the self-loosening of 3D printed bolts by changing the preload and amplitude. In addition, the FE simulation is verified through experimental results. Experimental results show that the 3D printed bolt loses much clamping force due to lateral vibration. Through this study, it is expected that 3D printed bolts will be used more frequently in situations where specially shaped bolts are needed.",

    "abstract": "Freeform reversible embedding of suspended hydrogels (FRESH) is a layer-by-layer extrusion-based technique to enable three-dimensional (3D) printing of soft tissue constructs by using a thermo-reversible gelatin support bath. Suboptimal resolution of extrusion-based printing limits its use for the creation of microscopic features in the 3D construct. These microscopic features (e.g., pore size) are known to have a profound effect on cell migration, cell-cell interaction, proliferation, and differentiation. In a recent study, FRESH-based 3D printing was combined with freeze-casting in the Freeze-FRESH (FF) method, which yielded alginate constructs with hierarchical porosity. However, use of the FF approach allowed little control of micropore size in the printed alginate constructs. Herein, the FF methodology was optimized for 3D printing of collagen constructs with greater control of microporosity. Modifications to the FF method entailed melting of the FRESH bath before freezing to allow more efficient heat transport, achieve greater control on microporosity, and permit polymerization of collagen molecules to enable 3D printing of stable microporous collagen constructs. The effects of different freezing temperatures on microporosity and physical properties of the 3D-printed collagen constructs were assessed. In addition, finite element (FE) models were generated to predict the mechanical properties of the microporous constructs. Further, the impact of different micropore sizes on cellular response was evaluated. Results showed that the microporosity of 3D-printed collagen constructs can be tailored by customizing the FF approach. Compressive modulus of microporous constructs was significantly lower than the non-porous control, and the FE model verified these findings. Constructs with larger micropore size were more stable and showed significantly greater cell infiltration and metabolic activity. Together, these results suggest that the FF method can be customized to guide the design of 3D-printed microporous collagen constructs.",

MDDW is an additive manufacturing approach that involves direct deposition of functional material to the substrate. The devices were printed directly onto a polymeric substrate by optimizing the fabrication parameters. A composite of silver and carbon was used as active sensor material where both materials in the composite have opposite resistance temperature coefficients. The ratio of materials in the composite was selected so that the effect of temperature on the resistance of overall composite was canceled out. This resulted in achieving temperature compensation or inherent independence of the strain sensor resistance on temperature without requiring any additional sensors and components. The sensor was further encapsulated by electrospray deposition, which is also an additive manufacturing approach, to eliminate the effect of humidity as well. Electrical and morphological characterizations were performed to investigate the output response of the sensors and their physical and structural properties. An analog signal conditioning circuit was developed for seamless interfacing of the sensor with any electronic system. The sensor had an excellent gauge factor of 45 and a strain sensitivity of 45 Ω/μɛ that is higher than most of the conventional strain sensors. The sensor's response showed excellent temperature and humidity compensation reducing the relative effect of temperature on the resistance by ∼99.5% and humidity by ∼99.8%.",

    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, electrospinning has emerged as a common technique to produce biomedical scaffolds composed of ultrafine fibers formed from many natural and synthetic polymers. A major advantage of this technique is the ability to produce scaffolds that resemble the native extracellular matrix in physical, chemical, and topological properties. However, scaffolds fabricated via electrospinning are not formed with a controlled architecture and typically do a poor job of directing cell growth into prescribed structures for tissue/organ development. To address these weaknesses, 3D bioprinting has recently been used to develop scaffolds that have a highly organized and precise global topology. Unfortunately, these 3D bioprinted scaffolds do not typically resemble the native extracellular matrix in physical properties, such as porosity, fiber diameter, and pore size (e.g., the microarchitecture). Thus, the goal of the current study was to develop a technique that harnesses the intrinsic advantages of both conventional electrospinning and 3D bioprinting techniques to produce scaffolds that have the potential to be used within biomedical applications. The physical properties of formed 3D printed electrospun scaffolds were compared with conventional electrospun and 3D printed scaffolds. Further, we conducted initial proof-of-concept biocompatibility studies to illustrate the applicability of the scaffolds within vascular applications. Our results illustrate that 3D printed electrospun scaffolds can be developed, via our technique, that have highly tailored and organized arbitrary geometries with scaffold properties in the range of the innate extracellular matrix. In addition, these scaffolds were shown to support endothelial cell growth. Therefore, we illustrate the development and testing of a novel bioscaffold fabrication technique that may be used for many tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications, which allows for the direct printing of electrospun scaffolds into well-defined macro-scale geometries that also retain the micro-structures commonly observed in electrospun scaffolds.",

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) imaging is described as a tool to visualize changes in oxygen distribution caused by light exposure. This nondestructive method uses radio waves and, therefore, is not constrained by optical opacity offering greater penetrating depth. Three proof-of-principle imaging experiments were demonstrated: (1) spatial propagation of the photopolymerization process; (2) oxygen depletion as a result of postcuring; and (3) oxygen visualization in a 3D printed spiral model. Commercial stereolithography (SLA) resin was used in these experiments. Lithium octa-n-butoxynaphthalocyanine (LiNc-BuO) probe was mixed with the resin to permit oxygen imaging. Li-naphthalocyanine probes are routinely used in various EPR applications because of their long-term stability and high functional sensitivity to oxygen.

    "abstract": "Based on the established system of concrete-filled fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) tube (CFFT) in civil engineering and construction industry, this research presents a novel fabrication method for freeform FRP formwork through an additive process of winding FRP fabric with industrial robots. Different from the filament winding or fused deposition modeling process in additive manufacture, large-scale formwork is fabricated with layered winding of FRP fabric and simultaneously applying fast cure epoxy resin in the proposed methods. It increases the fabrication speed and material efficiency compared with the typical fabrication process of FRP formworks, and achieved the geometry flexibility from the numerically controlled additive process. The fabrication methods are developed through a series of preliminary tests, exploring the appropriate fabrication parameters, such as the overlapping height of each layer, winding speed, and epoxy resin type. Two additional prototypes addressing geometrical flexibility are also fabricated. Based on the feasibility studies, the article discussed the potential application of this system on a double-skin tubular arch (DSTA) bridge and a tree-like topological optimized column as the future outlook of this method. As developed based on the established construction systems such as CFFTs and DSTAs, not only the proposed system is compatible with current structure and construction system, but it also benefits from combining an off-shelf material with a flexible and accurate programmable robotic process. This research contributes to the scope of additive manufacturing system by targeting the fabrication of nonuniform optimized large-scale structures.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing technology is gaining significant attention in many industries such as automobile, aerospace, and medical. In particular, directed-energy additive manufacturing using a laser source is of central interest, thanks to its geometric precision and higher quality products compared with other heat sources. To produce high-quality components, in-situ melt pool monitoring technology is required. This article deals with an in-situ melt pool size estimation method for directed-energy additive manufacturing using the measured resonant frequency and damping ratio. The test set-up is composed of an impact hammer and two laser Doppler vibrometers (LDV) connected to a Siemens LMS SCADAS FFT analyzer. The LDV was used to measure the velocity of the melt pool and an Al beam, whereas the impulse signal is given by the impact hammer. The melt pool shape was machined by drilling into the top surface of an Al beam that is 50 mm wide and 100 mm long. The diameter (D) of the melt pool was machined to 1 and 2 mm, and the depth of melt pool was machined from 0.5 to 1.5 D. A low-melting-temperature metal that transitions a 70°C was used to readily achieve the liquid state of the melt pool in a laboratory environment. The frequency response function results were obtained from the Siemens Test Laboratory Software. Then the modal parameters were calculated by using the rational fraction polynomial method to extract the natural frequency and damping ratio according to the Al beam length, melt pool diameter, and melt pool depth. As a result, we confirmed that the difference in the resonant frequency and a damping ratio of the melt pool was a function of the Al beam length, melt pool diameter, and melt pool depth.",

In this study, a distribution equation for the critical point for producing droplets defined in a dimensionless plane composed of Weber and Reynolds numbers was proposed. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to calculate the critical point distribution of the droplets generated by various materials in the dimensionless plane. Simulation results showed that the proposed distribution equation could describe the varying laws of the critical points of different materials. Process parameters in the distribution equation were identified using a fitting method based on CFD simulation results. The formula for calculating the critical characteristic velocity and dimensionless coordinates of the generated droplets was proposed based on the identified process parameters. The critical characteristic velocity and dimensionless coordinates of water, ethanol, aniline, and glycol were calculated using the proposed method. The average relative error between the calculated results and those from CFD is less than 5%. The drive waveforms of PPH are designed using the critical characteristic velocity of four different materials. Their droplet generation processes were recorded through a droplet watch system. The experimental results indicate that the flight velocity of the droplets generated at the critical characteristic velocity is close to zero, which indicates that the method proposed in this study is accurate.",

Timely solidification of the polymer jet is the key factor for the success of EJP process. In conventional solution-based EJP methods, it is usually achieved by rapid solvent evaporation and producing a scaffold with smooth filaments. In current study, by combining solution-based EJP with a cryogenic workbench, a cryogenic electrohydrodynamic jet printing (CEJP) system was developed, in which the polymer jet was frozen and solidified quickly at the freezing temperature rather than solvent evaporation. The feasibility and versatility of the CEJP system were verified by successful printing of scaffolds with different hole shapes and pore sizes. Meanwhile, the resulting scaffolds not only had a resolution in the range of 50–80 μm but also possessed oriented “ridges” and “valleys” on surface of the filaments, which was conductive to cell orientation. Therefore, this work provides a novel method to print fine scaffolds with extra surface topography.",

The present work tries to exploit this advantage, in the extrusion-based 3D printing process, to fabricate components with varying set of properties at different locations. The implementation is done using Hilbert area-filling curves with the displacement per unit force (i.e., compliance) applied being the property varying in a gradient manner. Four input parameters have been considered to study their effect on the compliance, and the single most influencing parameter has been selected using analysis of variance (ANOVA) for further study. Mapping of a selected input variable on the desired property has been discussed through numerical and experimental tests. Based on these studies, a demonstrative case study of a shoe sole has been designed and fabricated. Deflections of the fabricated component have been measured at different locations for uniform loading conditions. The deflection behavior of the fabricated component is found to be in line with the gradient force response required, thus validating the proposed approach. The current study is intended to provide the basic framework for fabrication of components tailored for force response using Hilbert curves.",

Herein, we introduce a simple and novel 3D-printed device to prepare hydrogel beads. The device is composed of a cylindrical tube with 1 inlet and 16 outlets. For the hydrogel solution, a low-melting-point agarose solution and sodium alginate are used. At a solution flow rate of 250 µL/min and a stir speed of 500, 1000, or 1250 rpm, the device produced beads of diameters 50–100, 30–60, and 5–30 µm, respectively. When the device was run at a flow rate of 500 µL/min at the above-mentioned stir speeds, the bead diameters were 100–150, 60–90, and 30–60 µm, respectively. Thus, this device can produce hydrogel beads of different sizes by altering the stir speed or the solution flow rate. In addition, we demonstrated that encapsulated MC3T3-E1 cells can survive and proliferate in the fabricated hydrogel when type I collagen is added to the gel solution. The simplicity of its design would make this device a valuable tool for rapid fabrication of cell-encapsulated hydrogels.",

The powder-binder formulations were characterized (e.g., particle size distribution and wettability of powder, viscosity and surface tension of liquid binder) and showed some different and similar characteristics when compared with commercial materials. The addition of solid (sodium alginate, sucrose) and liquid (glycerol, ethanol) additives in the powder-binder composition improved the experimental printed tests. The effect of binder composition and operating process parameters (binder saturation level, bleed compensation, and printed layer thickness) was analyzed and optimized to obtain a printed saucer with different designs. Results revealed some limitations related to the materials and the technology, thus justifying the introduction of technological improvements.

The results showed that both types of specimens differed from the original computer-aided design; although the origin of the deviation was different, the PBF samples were slightly inaccurate owing to the printing process where the accuracy of the FFF samples was influenced by postprocessing and removal of the scaffolds. The cranial implants fabricated using the FFF method absorbed more energy during the compression and impact tests in comparison with the PBF process. The failure mechanisms revealed that FFF samples have a higher ability to deform and a more consistent failure mechanisms, with the damage localized around the puncture head region. The brittle nature of the PBF samples, a feature observed with other polymers as well, led to complete failure of the cranial implants into several pieces.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) enables design freedom to fabricate functionally graded wave springs designed by varying design parameters, which are not possible in traditional manufacturing. AM also enables optimization of the wave spring design for specific load-bearing requirements. Existing wave springs are manufactured by metal with constant dimensions (width and thickness of the strip, diameter) using customized traditional machines in which design variations are almost impossible. This study aims to investigate the effect of wave height, the overlap between the two consecutive coils, and the number of waves per coil on the mechanical properties, for example, load-bearing capacity, stiffness, and energy absorption of contact wave springs. Two designs, that is, rectangular and variable thickness wave springs, were chosen and the design of experiment was devised using Minitab software, resulting in 24 samples. HP MultiJet Fusion (MJF) printer was used to manufacture the samples for performing uniaxial compression tests up to 10 cycles and 90% of the compressible distance to study the variation in mechanical properties due to changes in parameters. Experimental and simulation results showed that variable thickness wave springs have better load bearing, stiffness, and energy absorption compared with the rectangular counterparts. In addition to that, the number of waves per coil and the overlap are directly proportional to the load-bearing capacity as well as stiffness of the wave springs, while the constant wave height is responsible for more uniformly distributed stresses throughout the coils. Load-bearing capacity was increased by 62%, stiffness by 37%, and energy absorption by 20% once the number of waves per coil is increased from 5 to 6 in rectangular wave springs. Overall, the parametric variations significantly affect the performance of wave springs; thus, designers can choose the optimized values of investigated parameters to design customized wave springs for specific applications as per load/stiffness requirements.",

    "abstract": "Dental biofilms are complex medical biofilms that cause caries, the most prevalent disease of humankind. They are typically collected using handcrafted intraoral devices with mounted carriers for biofilm growth. As the geometry of handcrafted devices is not standardized, the shear forces acting on the biofilms and the access to salivary nutrients differ between carriers. The resulting variability in biofilm growth renders the comparison of different treatment modalities difficult. The aim of the present work was to design and validate an additively manufactured intraoral device with a dental bar produced by direct metal laser sintering and vat photopolymerized inserts with standardized geometry for the mounting of biofilm carriers. Additive manufacturing reduced the production time and cost, guaranteed an accurate fit of the devices and facilitated the handling of carriers without disturbing the biofilm. Biofilm growth was robust, with increasing thickness over time and moderate inter- and intraindividual variation (coefficients of variance 0.48-0.87). The biofilms showed the typical architecture and composition of dental biofilms, as evidenced by confocal microscopy and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Deeper inserts offering increased protection from shear tended to increase the biofilm thickness, whereas prolonged exposure to sucrose during growth increased the biofilm volume but not the thickness. Ratiometric pH imaging revealed considerable pH variation between participants and also inside single biofilms. Intraoral devices for biofilm collection constitute a new application for medical additive manufacturing and offer the best possible basis for studying the influence of different treatment modalities on biofilm growth, composition, and virulence.

The defect-free joint is obtained through WAAM and microstructural studies indicate the formation of intermetallics at the NiTi-Ti interface leading to higher microhardness values (600 HV). Shape recovery behavior and phase transformation temperature were also enhanced in comparison to NiTi. An improved actuation and bending angle recovery is observed in comparison with NiTi.

However, extracting the dynamic characteristics of the molten pool in the short laser welding process makes predicting of the welding quality in real time difficult. Accordingly, this study proposes a multimodel quality forecast (MMQF) method based on dynamic geometric features of molten pool to forecast the welding quality in real time. For extraction of geometric features of molten pool, an improved fully convolutional neural network is proposed to segment the collected dynamic molten pool images during the entire welding process. In addition, several dynamic geometric features of the molten pool are extracted by using the minimum enclosed rectangle algorithm with an evaluation of the performance by several statistical indexes. With regard to forecasting the welding quality, a nonlinear quadratic kernel logistic regression model is proposed by mapping the linear inseparable features to the high dimensional space. Experimental results show that the MMQF method can make an effective and stable forecast of welding quality. It performs well under small data and can satisfy the requirement of real-time forecast.",

Despite printing process improvements, post-processing of SLM components has not improved much, resulting in considerable costs, delay, and design limitations. Building upon recent advances in sensitization-based self-terminating etching processes, this work details a new set iodine-based sensitization and etching chemistries that simplify the post-processing of copper (Cu) alloy components fabricated using SLM. This work demonstrates that iodine can be used to \"sensitize\" the surface of copper alloy components to form soluble copper iodide salt that can be then dissolved in common solvents, such as acetonitrile. This process removes a predefined amount of material from all interior and exterior surfaces in a self-terminating manner, enabling facile removal of internal and external supports, removal of any trapped powder, and the smoothing of interior and exterior surfaces. We demonstrate this process on GRCop (Cu-chromium-niobium) alloys due to their widespread use by the rocket propulsion industry along with a demonstration in copper (110) for applications in heat exchangers and electromagnetic transmitters/receivers. Our results provide the first systematic study on the effect of iodization temperature and duration on the thickness of the iodide region in GRCop-84 components. Additionally, the surface roughness before and after each iodization-dissolution was also quantified for GRCop-84 and showed 70% reduction in R",

    "abstract": "In this work, open or closed air cavity (air bubble) inclusion structures are 3D printed via direct ink writing and fused deposition modeling methods utilizing materials of polydimethylsiloxane silicone or thermoplastic polyurethane, respectively, and these structures are examined for their attenuation capacity concerning ultrasonic waves in underwater environment. It is found that several factors, such as interstitial fencing layer, air cavity fraction, material interface interaction, and material property, are fundamental elements governing the overall attenuation performance. Hence, via 3D printing technique, which could conveniently manipulate structure's cavity volume fraction, such as via filament size and filament density on surface, structures with tunable attenuation could be designed. In addition, considering directions where ultrasound would encounter interfaces, that is, if the geometry could induce more interface interactions, such as triangular shape compared with simple square, it is possible to obtain immense attenuation enhancement, which does pave an additional approach for attenuation optimization via convoluted structural interface design that is exclusively tailored by additive manufacturing.",

However, most studies are still at an exploratory stage, lacking micromechanism research, such as the droplet ejection mechanism, the effect of printhead piezoelectric parameters on inkjet smoothness and preparation formability. In this study, based on the inkjet printing and observation platform, the Epson I3200-A1 piezoelectric printhead matched to the self-developed BJ-3DP was selected to analyze the droplet ejection state of self-developed ink at the microlevel with different piezoelectric pulse parameters. The results showed that there was a stable inkjet state with an inkjet pulse width of 3.5 μs, an ink supply pulse width of 4.5 μs, and a jet frequency in the range of 5000-19,000 Hz, ensuring both better droplet pattern and print accuracy, as well as high ejection efficiency. In conclusion, we performed a systematic evaluation of the inkjet behavior under different piezoelectric pulse parameters and provided a good idea and case study for the optimization of printhead piezoelectric parameters when BJ-3DP technology was used in pharmaceuticals.",

    "abstract": "An increasing demand for additively manufactured polymer composites with optimized mechanical properties is manifesting in different industries such as aerospace, biomedical, and automotive. Laser sintering (LS) is an additive manufacturing method that has the potential to produce reinforced polymers, which can meet the stringent requirements of these industries. For the development of a commercially viable LS nylon-based composite material, previous research studies worldwide have focused on adding glass beads to the powder material with the goal to produce fully dense parts with properties more representative of injection molded (IM) thermoplastic composites. This led to the development of a commercially available glass bead-filled polyamide 12 (PA12) powder. Although this powder has been on the market for quite a while, an in-depth comparison of the mechanical behavior of laser sintered versus IM glass bead-filled PA12 is lacking. In this study, laser-sintered glass bead-filled PA12 samples were built in different orientations and compared to IM counterparts. After sample production, the mechanical performance of the produced LS and IM parts was tested and compared to evaluate the quasistatic and dynamic mechanical performance and failure mechanisms at different load levels. In addition, the glass bead-filled PA12 properties were also compared to those of standard (unfilled) LS PA12 to assess whether glass beads actually improve the mechanical performance and fatigue lifetime of the final LS samples, as suggested in literature. Results in this work present and explain the increased stiffness but decreased fatigue life of glass bead-filled polyamide parts made by LS and IM. This research can be regarded as a \"benchmark\" study, in which samples produced from commercially available, filled and unfilled, PA12 powder grades are compared for both LS and conventional production techniques.",

In this study, the roughness of contour formworks was quantified by using 3D scanning. A large-scale formwork was fabricated by using a robotic 3D printer, and four types of cast-in-place concrete were poured into the formwork to form solid components. The interfacial bonding properties between the formwork and cast material were evaluated by splitting tensile tests and antisymmetric four-point bending shear tests. The interfacial microstructure was analyzed by using computed tomography and scanning electron microscopy. The bond performance can mainly be attributed to the mechanical interlock at the interface between the contour formwork and cast aggregated concrete. The self-compacting concrete with the expansion agent contributes the most to the interface bonding.",

The properties of the ink are very important, affecting the stability of the ejection and the precision of the finished product, but there is a great lack of research on pharmaceutical inks. This study used solvents and excipients commonly used in pharmaceuticals to quantify the printability of inks using printability Z value theory, while using an ink-jet printing and observation platform to analyze the droplet ejection state of different composition inks from microscopic level. Studies have shown that compared to ethanol, the ejection effect of droplets was better when isopropanol was added to the ink, and the proportion added should not be greater than 40%; as the molecular weight of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) increased, the concentration of PVP tolerated by the ink decreased; glycerin has a high ejection efficiency when the proportion is within 10%. In summary, a superior ink formulation of 40% aqueous isopropanol plus 0.1% PVP K30 and 4% glycerin was obtained. With this ink, levetiracetam dispersible tablets were prepared with a smooth printing process and the tablets had good appearance, good mechanical properties, and rapid release.

The model provides the ability to examine the effects of nonconventional process variables such as the chamber pressure and gravitational force on the suppression of the spatter and denudation phenomena. The simulation results imply that adjusting the gravitational force provides an effective technique for suppressing both spatter formation and powder bed denudation. In addition, the chamber pressure has only a marginal effect on the denudation phenomenon. In particular, under a higher operating pressure, the metal vapor tends to spout in the upward direction, while under a lower pressure, the spouting is more radially distributed. As a result, the simulation results obtained in this study have suggested that the chamber pressure and gravitational force may both provide feasible approaches for suppressing the spattering and denudation phenomena, particularly in the L-PBF processing of light-weight materials.",

To display the prediction results closer to real physical phenomena, advanced multiscale models coupled with various single-scale models are provided.

    "abstract": "Four-dimensional (4D) printing has emerged as a promising manufacturing technology in recent years and revolutionized products by adding shape-morphing capabilities when exposed to certain stimuli. Increasing research attention has been dedicated to studying the shape memory behaviors of the 4D fabricated structures. However, in-depth discussions on quantifying the influence of process parameters on shape fixity and recovery properties are limited, and the anisotropy induced by the layer-wise fabrication nature is significantly underreported. To further exploit the shape memory property of 4D printed structures, it is essential to investigate the process-induced anisotropic shape memory behaviors. In this study, the effects of critical process parameters on anisotropy in shape memory properties are mathematically quantified; meanwhile, the feasibility of tailoring the anisotropy of 4D printed parts is examined with joint consideration of total build time. Different scanning patterns are experimentally analyzed for their influence on anisotropic behaviors. It is found that the Triangle scanning pattern often leads to the best shape memory behaviors in different directions. The outcome of this study confirms the existence of anisotropy in both shape fixity and shape recovery ratios. In addition, the results also reveal that a smaller scanning angle tends to minimize the anisotropy and total fabrication time while ensuring satisfactory shape memory performance. Furthermore, layer thickness shows negligible effects on anisotropy, while the scanning angle and shape memory temperature suggest the opposite.",

    "abstract": "Material extrusion (MEX) enables the economical manufacturing of complex parts and small lot sizes. The quality of the additive manufactured parts is significantly influenced by process parameters, which are defined beforehand. However, the resulting part quality is often unknown, leading to a reduced applicability of the process and relatively high safety factors for the process parameters to ensure a certain quality. This results in long print times and high material consumption. This article aimed for an accurate prediction of the linear dimensional accuracy in X, Y, and Z direction of parts manufactured with MEX. A neural network (NN) was used with a hyperparameter tuning based on an evolutionary algorithm. The developed NN achieved a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 1.3% or lower for X and Y direction and 2.3% for Z direction by testing random parameter combinations (parameter sets). Moreover, when dealing with random and untrained interval lengths, the NN achieved a MAPE of 0.6% for X and Y direction and 3.3% for Z direction. The results show that the NN model achieved a more accurate and robust prediction compared with a multiple linear regression. The performed research fills an existing gap by developing a powerful NN model that enables the accurate prediction of linear dimensional accuracy based on used process parameters. The implications for practice are significant, as these prediction models can be readily used to improve the parameter settings for MEX and ensure that the desired accuracy levels are met. With further exploration of additional dimensional features and advances in data sharing techniques, the findings pave the way for future research to push the boundaries of accurate dimensional prediction in the field.",

    "abstract": "The implementation of online, nondestructive quality control (QC) solutions is a key aspect to consider especially in medical device manufacturing, where the production process should comply to relevant quality-related standards to guarantee a safe product for the patient. For metallic implants fabricated using electron beam melting (EBM), the presence of defects (e.g., porosities, cracks, delamination, balling effect) could affect the final part quality in terms of structural integrity and mechanical properties. In this context, we propose an expert system algorithm capable of automated detection of porosities that could occur in prosthetic components, such as tibial trays, printed using a cobalt-chromium alloy. The choice of focusing only on the porosities was done as these defects are particularly critical for orthopedic prosthesis, where they can negatively impact the fatigue behavior of the printed component. The algorithm was developed ad hoc to analyze images of the manufacturing process taken from a camera embedded in the printer (Arcam Q10plus). Images can be used to identify porosities, performing a nondestructive evaluation that supports the process of part qualification. The developed algorithm automates and improves the visual inspection task conducted by human experts, including quantitative assessment on the size and location of the porosities, and reporting the presence of high porosity density areas. The defect detection performance was evaluated through the design of two tasks: The layer-wise defect detection and the large pore identification. The defect detection was performed with a sensitivity of 91% and a precision of 76%. Furthermore, a comparison with the gold-standard nondestructive evaluation technique, that is, computed tomography evaluation, allowed to validate the algorithm (percent agreement of 98%). The developed expert system allows to quickly evaluate an entire printing volume with several components representing a reliable and fast tool for defect detection and QC of EBM-printed prosthetic components.",

Fabrication of 3D-printed strain gauges through fused deposition modeling technology offers compatibility and flexibility in adopting different substrate and conductive materials. The performance of a 3D-printed strain sensor depends on the selection of the conductive and substrate materials. This work focuses on the effects of substrate material variations and sensor geometrical variations on sensitivity, accuracy, stability, and working range of conductive polylactic acid (CPLA)-based 3D-printed strain sensor. Four variants of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) materials with different shore hardness values such as thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) 70A, eLastic TPE 83A, eFlex TPU 87A, and eTPU 95A have been chosen as the substrate materials. Strain sensors are 3D printed with all TPU substrate variants with CPLA in five different configurations, namely linear, serpentine, square, triangular, and trapezoidal. The resistance change ratios of the printed sensors, gauge factor, strain limits, and hysteresis error are computed by loading the sensor over various strain values under multiple cycles. Results revealed that the CPLA-eTPU 95A in triangular configuration outperforms other TPU variants in terms of gauge factor and hysteresis error. The gauge factor and hysteresis error exhibited by the CPLA-eTPU 95A in triangular configuration are 18.63% higher and 18.37% lower than that of CPLA-eFlex TPU 87A sensor, respectively. This happens due to high elastic modulus and shape recovery characteristics of eTPU 95A substrate; whereas the stretching limit of eTPU 95A is 25% lower than the eFlex TPU 87A substrate. Finally, by changing the vertical distance between the surface layers of the sensing element and the substrate material as 0.1 mm, a significant increase of 54% in the working range of CPLA-eTPU 95A strain sensor was observed.",

    "abstract": "The preparation of WC-Co cemented carbides by laser-based additive manufacturing (AM) is challenging, as the resulting products are often plagued by crack and pore defects. In this study, Cu-doped WC-12Co cemented carbides were successfully prepared by laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF). The effects of LPBF parameters and Cu doping on the defects, microstructures, and properties of the WC-12Co cemented carbides were analyzed. It was found that the laser scanning speed had a significant effect on the density of the AM specimen, and that the doping of Cu reduced cracks. A slow scanning speed and small amounts of Cu dopant were found to be conducive to the manufacturing of highly dense WC-12Co-xCu AM specimens. The microstructure of LPBF-prepared WC-12Co-xCu cemented carbides contained alternating coarse- and fine-grained regions. Cu doping reduced the size of the W2C phase, caused the W1-x C phase to disappear, significantly reduced grain sizes, and increased the number of low-angle grain boundaries. Cu doping also reduced microhardness; the microhardness of the WC-12Co-3Cu specimen that was prepared using a laser scanning speed of 500 mm/s was 25.45% lower than that of WC-12Co. However, compressive strength was significantly increased by Cu doping; the compressive strength of the WC-12Co-3C specimen was 36.20% higher than that of WC-12Co. The wetting angle initially increased (up to a peak of 154° with 2 wt.% Cu) and then decreased with increasing Cu content. The maximum wetting angle was ∼5.7 times that of the undoped AM specimen.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing has revolutionized structural optimization by enhancing component strength and reducing material requirements. One approach used to achieve these improvements is the application of multi-lattice structures, where the macro-scale performance relies on the detailed design of mesostructural lattice elements. Many current approaches to designing such structures use data-driven design to generate multi-lattice transition regions, making use of machine learning models that are informed solely by the geometry of the mesostructures. However, it remains unclear if the integration of mechanical properties into the dataset used to train such machine learning models would be beneficial beyond using geometric data alone. To address this issue, this work implements and evaluates a hybrid geometry/property Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for generating multi-lattice transition regions. In our study, we found that hybrid VAEs demonstrate enhanced performance in maintaining stiffness continuity through transition regions, indicating their suitability for design tasks requiring smooth mechanical properties.",

    "abstract": "Four-dimensional printing (4DP) via fused deposition modeling has been used to create hygromorphic biocomposite actuators through wood polymer composite (WPC) filaments. The shape-change transformation of the 4DP composite mechanism is preprogrammed by controlling the printing process parameters and the design of the print-path pattern. Until now, most 4DP approaches involving Wood Polymer Composite (WPCs) have focused on planar actuators featuring a bilayer structure composed of laminar layers with distinct material properties. These mechanisms show a laminar initial rest state, presenting as flat objects, and can only achieve a complex three-dimensional shape when subjected to the moisture variations stimulus. The presented research highlights the development of a multistage printing method that expands the capabilities of three-axis printers to enable the 4DP of mechanism with complex nonplanar rest-state geometries. The new technical capabilities of this method are demonstrated here through the creation and testing of novel nonlaminar 4DP mechanisms that harness their unique doubly curved rest-state geometry to achieve kinematic amplification. We expect that this approach can greatly improve the range and complexity of 4DP mechanisms that can be developed using the commonly available three-axis printers.",

    "abstract": "This study addresses the influence of build orientation and loading direction on the static and dynamic mechanical properties of three-dimensional-printed thermoplastic polyurethane-based lattice structures (with different cell shape). Specimens were printed in horizontal, 45° angle, and vertical orientations. Three-point bending tests showed that the investigated specimens are characterized by a strong anisotropy of the mechanical properties, which depends on the loading direction. In this regard, the influence of the loading direction is much stronger for the specimens printed vertically or at an angle of 45°, whereas the properties of the lattice structures printed horizontally are almost isotropic. The best set of mechanical properties (regardless of the loading direction) is shown by the samples of lattice materials, with square cells obtained by horizontal orientation of the polymer layers. The possibility of significant (one order of magnitude) increase in strength properties with satisfactory ductility is shown by using an epoxy polymer as a filler. A mathematical model of the bending of a mesostructured beam was established, which made it possible to describe qualitatively the various mechanisms of its destruction, such as: the breaking of the bonds between the polymer layers due to their mutual sliding and flaking, and the rapture of the layers themselves. The findings presented here provide new insights into the development of lattice structures with unique mechanical properties for a wide range of applications.",

This study aims at exploring the feasibility of using plastic material in asphalt concrete followed by the design and evaluation of modified asphalt mix. Four different types of asphalt mixtures were made by mixing mineral aggregates with plastic aggregates of different shapes and sizes. The conventional dense-graded asphalt concrete incorporating mineral aggregates was selected as control material, whereas the other three types of asphalt mixtures were produced by substituting 3D-printed plastic aggregates for mineral aggregates. Marshall characteristics were utilized to evaluate the volumetric and mechanical properties of the asphalt mixtures. Test results show that the asphalt mixture containing solid plastic aggregate appears to have a 14.3% reduction in bulk density, thereby potentially reducing the haul costs. Due to the angular shape of the aggregate, the stability for the asphalt mixture containing the 3D-printed aggregate is 1.95 times higher than that for the asphalt mixture incorporating all mineral aggregates. The addition of the plastic printed aggregate enhances the strain capacity to achieve failure of the asphalt mixture. However, caution should be taken when incorporating the hollow or fine printed aggregates into the asphalt mixture due to their variation of volumetric properties.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional printing (3DP) is considered to be one of the important technologies for a new manufacturing mode. When ceramsite sand is used as a 3DP material to produce a mold (core), the printed layer is prone to deviation from the original location. In this study, the continuous stacking of the printed part deviation was termed as pushing dislocation, and a physical model was designed to investigate the pushing dislocation mechanism. When the gravity of the printing layer and the pressure of the sand scraper decreased, or when the supporting force increased, the angle of the sand scraper and the maximum friction of the prelaying layer on the printed part will reduce the pushing dislocation. To optimize the quality of the ceramsite sand mold, experiments on the pushing dislocation were conducted by altering the recoater speed, layer thickness, and bottom support condition (with or without bottom supporting plate). The sample dimensions were obtained by a 3D imaging scanner, and the gas evolution and ignition loss were measured. The results revealed that the dimensional difference of samples continuously decreased and the pushing dislocation was gradually reduced as the recoater speed and layer thickness increased. The pushing dislocation of the X-direction sample was more severe compared with that of the Y-direction sample. Increasing the layer thickness is an effective way of reducing the pushing dislocation. The bottom supporting plate can reduce the pushing dislocation, but the effect was insignificant.",

    "abstract": "The current available selective laser sintering (SLS) materials are often high in cost and limited in variety; the mechanical properties of wood-composite SLS parts are low quality, which restricts the development of SLS technology. This article aims to optimize the SLS processing parameters to enhance the mechanical properties of the Prosopis chilensis powder (PCP)/polyethersulfone (PES) composite (PCPC) part fabricated via SLS. The PCP and PES powder were proposed as the feedstock of the PCPC powder bed for SLS. First, the thermal decomposition and glass transition temperatures (Tg) of PCP and PES powder were estimated to reduce the produced PCPC parts from warping and deformation during SLS. An orthogonal experimental methodology with five factors and four levels was used to optimize the SLS parameters for the PCPC SLS test. The scanning speed, preheating temperature, and laser power are selected as the main affecting factors on this study. The influence of these factors on dimension accuracies, bending and tensile strengths, and surface roughness quality of the produced PCPC parts was studied. The PCPC particle distribution and microstructure were inspected via scanning electron microscopy. Furthermore, the synthesis weighted scoring methods were utilized to determine the optimal SLS processing parameters of the produced PCPC parts. The combined results of tests showed that the optimal SLS parameters were as follows: the scanning speed is 1.8 m/s, preheating temperature is 80°C, and the laser power is 12 W. Thus, the quality of PCPC SLS parts was significantly enhanced when the optimal parameters were utilized in the SLS process. This article provided the main reference values of SLS parameters of the PCPC. To further enhance the surface roughness quality and mechanical strengths, the postprocessing infiltration with wax was introduced; after wax infiltration, the surface roughness and mechanical strengths were significantly improved.",

The proposed method avoids the use of toxic volatile solvents (used in metal-based robocasting), adopting copper oxide as a precursor of copper metal due to its lower cost and higher chemical stability. The appropriate rheological properties of the colloids have been obtained through the addition of poly-ethylene oxide-co-polypropylene-co-polyethylene oxide copolymer (Pluronic P123) and poly-acrylic acid to the suspension of the oxide in water. Mixing of the components of the colloidal suspension was performed with the same syringes used for the extrusion, avoiding any material waste. The low-temperature transition of water solutions of P123 is used to facilitate the homogenization of the colloid. The copper oxide is then converted to copper metal through a reductive sintering process, performed at 1000°C for a few hours in an atmosphere of Ar-10%H",

    "abstract": "In pelvic trauma patients, the mismatch of complex geometries between the pelvis and fixation implant is a fundamental cause of unstable and displaced pelvic ring disruption, in which secondary intervention is strongly considered. The geometrical matching in the current customized implant design and clinical practice is through the nonfractured hemi-pelvis for the fractured pelvis. This design philosophy overlooks the anatomical difference between the hemipelves, and further, the geometrical asymmetry at local area still remains unknown. This study analyzed the anatomical asymmetry of a patient's 3D pelvic models from 13 patients. The hemipelves of each patient were registered by using an iterative closet algorithm to an optimum position with minimum deviations. The high deviation regions were summarized between the hemipelves in each case, and a color map was drawn on a hemipelvis model that identified the areas that had a high possibility to be symmetrically different. A severe pelvic trauma case was used to comprehend the approach by designing a 3D printed implant. Each fracture was then registered to the mirrored uninjured hemipelvis by using the same algorithm, and customized fixation implants were designed with reference to the fractured model. The customized fixation plates showed that the implants had lower geometrical deviation when attached onto the re-stitched fracture side than onto the mirrored nonfractured bone. These results indicate that the symmetrical analysis of bone anatomy and the deviation color map can assist with implant selection and customized implant design given the geometrical difference between symmetrical bones. The novel approach provides a scientific reference that improves the accuracy and overall standard of 3D printed implants.",

After initial issues due to the porosity of the parts, a consequence of the FDM technique, and difficulties in clearing the interior of the probes after manufacturing, a suitable design solution was achieved, with the results from the 3D printed probe being finally identical to those of a standard reference metallic Pitot tube at the investigated airspeed range of 2.1–31.5 m/s. Exploiting the freedom of form that 3D printing allows, several special-shaped pressure anemometer geometries were designed, with the intent of increasing the pressure signal outputted from the probes to achieve a better measurement precision, particularly at low air speeds. In the process of shape exploration of the pressure enhancing probes, computational fluid dynamics experiments were performed to give insights on suitable designs. The special-shaped pressure probes were tested at speeds ranging from 2.2 to 10.4 m/s, with the maximum pressure signal amplification being obtained by a 3D printed Pitot tube of basic conventional geometry equipped with 3D printed add-on parts. This result is relevant as it shows that existing Pitot tubes of traditional metallic construction can have their pressure output enhanced with the installation of bespoke fabricated 3D printed add-on parts. Although 3D printing did not prove to be particularly advantageous to fabricate simple Pitot tubes, special-purpose complex-shaped pressure anemometers can strongly benefit from this technology due to the freedom of shape design at no extra cost that it allows.",

This study focuses on the REPRAP PRUSA i3 Printer that can print itself a part that combined with an infusion pump extends the capabilities of this printer, which can now create different types of hydrophobic patterns on an abundant, renewable substrate: paper. Different flow rates of the syringe pump and printing velocities are combined to optimize the resolution of this new manufacturing process. Besides different papers are used to print patterns to either check the influence of the paper type on the printing resolution or to choose the more suitable paper to build blood typing assays. The resolution improves decreasing flow rate and increasing printing velocity to a minimum value ∼10% higher than the needle diameter. The printer working with a G25 needle prints microfluidic patterns that can be used to evaluate the blood type on different types of chromatographic papers. Two blood types (A− and O−) are evaluated with this new approach with results equivalent to traditional methods, validating its feasibility in clinical practice. This novel printing method for paper-based microfluidics manufacturing does not require specialized equipment or skills, it is fast and inexpensive, and thus can help to introduce the advantage of healthcare in areas where access to health systems is not guaranteed.",

Magnetic resonance images were used to create a CAD (Computer-Aided Design) file that is subsequently used as input for a 3D printer machine. Artificial ligaments were used to mimic the stability of the knee. The quadriceps tendon was simulated using a polyvinylchloride cord attached to the tibial insertion and the patella. The model was fixed to a tensile test machine and four static tests were performed by applying 200 N load in the proximal–distal direction through the cord at 30°, 60°, and 90° of knee flexion. The position of the patella was measured using a motion-tracking system with a custom-made navigation system. The mediolateral displacement of the patella was 1.01 ± 0.13 mm at 30° of knee flexion and 7.99 ± 0.07 mm at 90° of flexion. The patella lateral tilt was 2.79° ± 0.67° at 30° of flexion and 6.42° ± 0.11° at 90° of flexion. In conclusion, our low-cost knee model closely simulates the patellar behavior of cadaveric specimens as the results are in agreement with literature data on similar static in vitro experiments.",

    "abstract": "Stereolithographic additive manufacturing technology has developed from point-by-point scanning exposure to layer-by-layer masking curing and even volumetric printing. Rapid prototyping is one of the important goals pursued by researchers. A continuous three-dimensional (3D) printing system based on the dual-color photoinitiation and photoinhibition is proposed with the aim of further improving printing speed. The process of continuous 3D printing is realized through the anti-polymerization layer between the cured part and the window generated by the ultraviolet (UV) light sheet (355 nm), and dynamic masking with the blue light (470 nm). The volume of the anti-polymerization layer can be adjusted by the intensity ratio of the incident lights (IUV, 0/Iblue,0) and the size of UV laser spot to enhance the reflow filling rate of the liquid resin. For the orthogonal Gaussian anti-polymerization layer, an intensity ratio of 28.6 allows for an inhibition volume of 97.1% of the desired rectangular anti-polymerization zone with a height of 1 mm. The simulation analysis of continuous 3D printing process by flow-structure interaction reveals that the increase of the thickness of the anti-polymerization layer effectively improves the filling rate of the resin and the cross-sectional area of printing, and reduces the stress of the cured part. The experiments with two different 3D structures printing demonstrate that the filling rate and the stress have virtually no effect on the printing process at a large-scale thickness of the anti-polymerization layer, and the printing speed is capable of reaching 200 μm/s. Certainly, the printing volume and complexity can be further improved with the improvement of the system and the optimization of the resin.",

The main focus has been on the effective fabrication of microfluidic channels with different materials, where the manufacturing limitations proved to be the main stumbling blocks. Paper-based MFFCs have been reported with some success, where the porosity of the flow channel medium drives the reactants, greatly reducing the need for elaborate external devices and complex manufacturing obstacles, although the longevity of these cells remains questionable. The current article addresses this issue by replacing the paper-based flow channels with 3D-printed substrates of different structural forms to serve as pathways for controlled flow and mixing responses of the reactant liquids without the use of other devices, such as micro pumps and valves. The line-by-line material consolidation mechanics of fused filament fabrication and the porous mesostructural responses of a commercial polymer filament are combined to build the microfluidic fuel channels of varying configurations. Numerical and experimental characterizations proved the cells to perform better than the current paper-based counterparts, apart from better longevity and possible new opportunities for future improvements based on more complex micro-, meso-, and macrostructural advances.",

Successful sintering of metal NPs with fs laser is challenging due to the ablation caused by hot electron effects. In this study, a double-pulse sintering strategy with a pair of time-delayed fs-laser pulses is proposed for controlling the electron temperature while still maintaining a high enough lattice temperature. We demonstrate that when delay time is slightly longer than the electron-phonon coupling time of Cu NPs, the ablation area was drastically reduced and the power window for successful sintering was extended by about two times. Simultaneously, the heat-affected zone can be reduced by 66% (area). This new strategy can be adopted for all the SLS processes with fs laser and unlock the power of SLS with fs lasers for future applications.",

As the number of publications increases, there is a need for an automatic tool that can help researchers do more comprehensive literature analysis, standardize the nomenclature, and so accelerate the development of novel manufacturing techniques and materials for the field. In this context, we propose an automatic keyword annotation model, based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, that can be used to find insights in the bioprinting scientific literature. The approach is based on two main data sources, the abstracts and related author keywords, which are used to train a composite model based on (i) an embeddings part (using the FastText algorithm), which generates word vectors for an input keyword, and (ii) a classifier part (using the Support Vector Machine algorithm), to label the keyword based on its word vector into a manufacturing technique, employed material, or application of the bioprinted product. The composite model was trained and optimized based on a two-stage optimization procedure to yield the best classification performance. The annotated author keywords were then reprojected on the abstract collection to both generate a lexicon of the bioprinting field and extract relevant information, like technology trends and the relationship between manufacturing-material-application. The proposed approach can serve as a basis for more complex NLP-related analysis toward the automated analysis of the bioprinting literature.",

It is especially suitable for preparing functionally gradient materials (FGM). However, due to the large temperature gradient and the change in material composition, the residual stress is very high, which will seriously affect the mechanical properties and manufacturing accuracy of the structure. In this study, the thermomechanical coupled finite element model based on the Bessel heat source is established, and the residual stress in LAM TC4/TC11 FGM is obtained. The results show that the Bessel heat source can effectively suppress the generation of residual stress in the additive manufacturing process, and the finite element results are consistent with the experimental results. Compared with the traditional Gaussian heat source, the maximal residual tensile stress is reduced by an average of 28.1%. The value of residual stress increases with the increase in the number of printing layers, and it increases with the increase of the laser power and decreases with the increase of the scanning speed. The overall trend is that the two sides are compressive stress and the middle is tensile stress. The research has important reference significance for the reasonable suppression of the residual stress in FGM produced by LAM.",

SLS supports small- to medium-batch fabrication of customized products for various end-use applications. These parts can be used as tooling to support conventional manufacturing and inspection where mechanical and tribological behaviors are important. This article evaluates the friction behavior of parts fabricated by SLS polyamide (PA12) and glass bead-filled polyamide (PA-GF) materials. Pin-on-Disk tribometer was used to characterize the behavior in dry sliding conditions with part build orientation, load, and speed as factors. Taguchi's approach and analysis of variance are used to quantify the influence of these factors on the friction coefficient. Both materials show reduction in friction coefficient with the increase in load; on the other hand, an increase in speed affects adversely. However, the influence of part orientation is comparatively lesser than the other two factors considered in this study. The debris, pin, and disk wear surfaces were examined to learn wear mechanisms. It is observed that surface porosity resulting from the fabrication process plays a significant role in friction behavior. The glass beads in PA-GF material function as reinforcement against load and influences the friction behavior. Low friction and wear characteristics make both materials as a prospective contender for tooling application.",

Compared with traditional treatment methods, bio-3D printing technology features better utility in the field of cartilage repair and regeneration, but still faces great challenges. For example, there is currently no means to generate blood vessels inside the scaffolds, and there remains the question of how to improve the biocompatibility of the generated scaffolds, all of which limit the application of bio-3D printing technology in this area. The main objective of this article was to prepare sodium alginate-xanthan gum-hydroxyapatite (SA-XG-HA) porous cartilage scaffolds that can naturally degrade in the human body and be used to promote cartilage damage repair by 3D printing technology. First, the viscosities of SA and XG were analyzed, and their optimal ratio was determined. Second, a mathematical model of the hybrid slurry was established based on the power-law fluid model, in which the printing pressure, needle movement speed, and fiber spacing were established as important parameters affecting the printing performance of the composite. Third, by performing a finite element simulation of the printing process and combining it with the actual printing process, suitable printing parameters were determined (air pressure of 1 bar, moving speed of 9 mm/s, line spacing of 1.6 mm, and adjacent layers of 0-90°). Fourth, composite scaffolds were prepared and tested for their compressive properties, degradation properties, cytotoxicity, and biocompatibility. The results showed that the novel composite scaffolds prepared in this study possessed good mechanical and biological properties. Young's modulus of the composite scaffolds reached 130 KPa and was able to maintain a low degradation rate in simulated body fluid solution for >1 month. The activity of the C5.18 chondrocytes in the scaffold leach solution exceeded 120%. The cells were also able to proliferate densely on the scaffold surface.",

When there are contraindications to treatment with oral anticoagulants, another therapeutic option to reduce the possibility of thrombus formation in the LAA is the implantation of an occlusion device by cardiac catheterization. The effectiveness of LAA occlusion is dependent on accurate preprocedural device sizing and proper device positioning at the LAA ostium, to ensure sufficient device anchoring and avoid peri-device leaks. Additive manufacturing, commonly known as three-dimensional printing (3DP), of LAA models is beginning to emerge in the scientific literature to address these challenges through procedural simulation. This review aims at clarifying the impact of 3DP on preprocedural planning of LAA occlusion, specifically in the training of cardiac surgeons and in the assessment of the perfect adjustment between the LAA and the biomedical implant.",

This study investigates the feasibility of using 3D-printed thermoplastic to improve daylight distribution and transmission. To identify how geometry influences light distribution and transmission, 12 samples with various patterns were robotically fabricated. In a physical simulation of spring, summer, and winter, a robotic arm was used to direct light onto the samples in both the vertical and horizontal print pattern directions. In addition, three samples of conventional facade materials, including a polycarbonate panel, a polycarbonate sheet, and a single sheet of glass, were compared with the 3D-printed samples. All samples were examined and compared using high dynamic range imaging to qualitatively characterize luminance. The data analysis demonstrated that 3D-printed geometry can successfully generate customizable diffusive light distribution based on the needs of the user. Furthermore, the results showed that the vertical pattern direction had higher light transmission values than the horizontal pattern direction.",

Also, it changes the model of students' participation in the teaching process so that they become active participants. This article considers the involvement of 3D printing in the teaching process in the field of hydraulic and pneumatic components by using the developed methodology. The goal was to find an approach that would help students to easier understand the design and operation principles of these components. The methodology was developed and applied in various forms of the teaching process during a 5-year period. The application of the methodology was evaluated based on the results of the online questionnaire. Traditional theoretical approaches enable a good transfer of basic engineering knowledge, but students are usually not ready to apply them in practice. The results show that the largest number of students (81%) stated that 3D printing should be included in the teaching process. The main reason was a better understanding of the considered components and the possibility of the application of acquired knowledge in the industry. 3D printing enables students to understand the considered component, its design, and operational principle. Further application of 3D printing enables the development of additional skills related to the developing, modeling, and manufacturing (printing) components. Also, students expressed increased motivation for learning.",

For this purpose, vat photopolymerization (VPP) additive manufacturing is a promising method for surface generation; however, together with the fabrication process, the design phase needs to be optimized to achieve the desired surface property. This work presents the influence of the design features of hydrophobic surfaces through multiple studies on simple pillar structures, intrinsic single-unit geometries, and surface deposition on complex substrates. The results showed that depending on the dimensions of single pillar dimensions, wetting properties can extend between the contact angles (CA) of 83°–115.11°. The hydrophobicity was further increased by applying a re-entrant structure, reaching the CA of 115.24°. The surface deposition on the complex substrates significantly increased water droplet adhesion, preventing it from rolling off, which can be beneficial for manifold device protection from the hazardous influence of the environment. In addition, the influence of the surface on the acoustic properties was examined, which showed that the pattern application in the real-life device does not have a detrimental effect on the intrinsic functionality. This study showed that the design phase should be an essential part of the VPP process chain as it significantly influences the wetting properties of the surfaces.",

This study replicates the build processes and tensile tests undertaken by AM material manufacturers to compare tensile strengths achieved with those stated on the manufacturers' data sheets. These are important data to research and analyze as either it will corroborate properties given by the manufacturers and provide confidence in the values provided or it will show that the manufacturer's values cannot always be achieved and that designers and engineers must be more critical about the values manufacturers are providing when using the materials in their own applications. Tensile tests were performed on additively manufactured specimens that had been built using the same parameters that were used during the manufacturers' testing procedures. Digital image correlation was used to accurately measure strain in the test samples, enabling material properties to be determined. Microscopy analysis enabled the visual inspection of the print quality, the identification of defects, and the determination of volume fraction with the samples. The results show inconsistencies between the tensile strength results achieved during this study and the tensile strengths stated by the manufacturers. The results show that two materials exceeded the expected values and one material did not reach the expected value. Analysis of the 3D printed specimens shows that poor fiber-matrix wetting, large voids, and weak interfacial bonding were accountable for the lower-than-expected tensile strength results. While good print quality, low void percentage, proper fiber-matrix wetting, and good control measures were accountable for results that exceeded expectation. These results show that designers and engineers cannot solely rely on material data sheets to establish the mechanical properties of their 3D printed components.",

To achieve suitable printability and subsequently, structures with high shape fidelity and appropriate mechanical properties, the selected compositions were evaluated by rheological analysis and mechanical tests. The results demonstrated that the prepared inks exhibited shear thinning behavior, and by increasing the concentration of Pluronic and biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP), more consistent gels were obtained that were able to maintain their shape after printing. The compressive strength of the scaffolds varied in the range of ∼8-60 MPa. The morphology of the sintered scaffolds in the scanning electron microscopy images also showed a dual macro- and micropore-size architecture, which can promote the adhesion of proteins and cell behavior.

However, fewer works were reported in the realm of laser additive manufacturing (LAM) and the mechanism of grain refinement consequent to the PMF is still unclear. In this work, numerical models were developed to study the thermal-fluid characteristics in the Ti-alloy melt pool generated during the laser scanning process under the effect of a combined direct current (DC) electric field and PMF. The temperature field and magneto-oscillation effect in the melt pool were discussed to elucidate the resultant microstructure evolution. The results show that the application of a combined DC electric field and PMF could decrease the maximum temperature in the melt pool, but increase the temperature gradient at the liquid-solid interface. The electric-magnetic field can lead to a notable increase in the magnitude of the fluid velocity and a greater fluctuation in the magnitude. A more refined microstructure is expected to be obtained, of which the mechanism may be ascribed to not only the increased temperature gradient, solidification growth rate, and cooling rate at the liquid-solid interface but also the enhanced fluid convection and continuous impulse force in the melt. For better grain refinement, the preferable duty cycles of the PMF should be <50%. The findings of this study may give a new insight into the electromagnetic controlling methods for LAM of Ti-alloy parts.",

    "abstract": "The utilization of bone scaffold implants represents a promising approach for repairing substantial bone defects. In recent years, various traditional scaffold structures have been developed and, with advances in materials biology and computer technology, novel scaffold designs are now being evaluated. This study investigated the effects of a novel scaffold unit cell design (Hexanoid) through a computational framework, comparing its performance to that of four well-known scaffold designs. A finite element analysis numerical simulation and mechanical testing were conducted to analyze the dynamic bone ingrowth process and the mechanical strength of the different scaffold designs. Bone formation within the Ti-6Al-4V metal scaffolds was simulated based on the theory of bone remodeling. The outcomes of the study reveal that the novel scaffold design (Hexanoid) attains a notably elevated ultimate bone volume fraction (∼27%), it outperformed conventional unit-cell designs found in extant literature, such as cubic design with 19.1% and circular design with 16.9% in relation to the bone-to-cavity volume ratio. This novel structure also has comparable mechanical strength to that of human compact bone tissue. While the design was not optimal in every category, it provided a very satisfactory overall performance regarding certain key aspects of bone performances in comparison with the five scaffold structures evaluated. Although limitations exist in this project, similar methodologies can also be applied in the primary evaluation of new scaffold structures, resulting in improved efficiency and effectiveness. In future research, the results of this project may be integrated with clinical rehabilitation processes to offer a critical evaluation for optimization of additional novel scaffold unit-cell structure designs.",

For that reason, it is necessary to determine which parameters are the driving parameters. This will allow for only critical parameters to be experimentally found resulting in more accurate simulations faster. This article uses a Plackett-Burman design of experiment to screen for the material properties with the greatest effect on the results of a thermal mathematical model of a laser-based directed energy deposition (DED) AM process. It was found that variances in the absorption of the laser at 880 and 922 K along with variances in the thermal conductivity at 922 K have the largest effect on the range of the response variables that were used to characterize the melt pool. Having a smaller impact on the results are the thermal conductivity at 1491 K and the specific heat at 733 K, and the remainder of the factors have a negligible effect on the melt pool characteristics within the simulation.",

This is especially important in prosthetics, where more complex prostheses, especially of a hand, can cause enormous expense. However, providing the full functionality of a prosthesis often requires combining materials with different properties, such as rigidity and flexibility. The use of such a combination in multi-material printing involves a problem of delamination at the interface between two materials. The research described in this article focused on modifying the structure of the interface to improve adhesion between rigid and flexible materials. Polylactide (PLA), thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) were used. PLA-TPU85, PLA-TPU98, ABS-TPU85, and ABS-TPU98 joints were tested in a three-point bending test. Among the above-mentioned joints, the one called PLA-TPU85 presented the best properties, that is, the ability to transfer forces. Therefore, this joint was selected for further modifications. To improve the adhesion in PLA-TPU85 joint, a sandwich-type structure was designed, and its effectiveness was tested in a shear test. The samples lacking this structure became delaminated during the test, whereas those with the sandwich structure maintained the integrity. Thus, the effectiveness of such a solution was confirmed and applied to the connection of rigid and flexible materials in the final printing of the prosthesis.",

A retractable needle jig with vacuum negative pressure was used to absorb and place grits in an orderly arranged manner. However, needle hole wear after a long service time could not promise complete grit adsorption forever. This article proposed an improved YOLOv5s to detect the adsorption status of diamond grits on pinholes to maintain the planting rate of diamond grits in each matrix during the additive manufacturing process. First, the added detection head extracts higher level semantic information. Second, depthwise separable convolution + batch normalization + sigmoid linear unit modules containing depthwise separable convolutions (DSC) are used instead of convolution + batch normalization + sigmoid linear unit to reduce the number of parameters. Introducing DSC into the Bottleneck1 module results in faster computational speed than introducing bottleneck. Finally, coordinate attention is added at appropriate locations to improve detection accuracy. The improved YOLOv5s achieves an average 19.6% reduction in both parameters and floating point operations per second. The inspection system performance was validated by collecting data on a large number of vacancies and worn vacancy pinholes. Compared with the original YOLOv5s, the detection time for a layer of diamond grits with the system based on the improved YOLOv5s model decreased from 6.35 to 5.06 ms, and the detection accuracy was higher than 98%. When the absorption rate was detected below 95%, a redo command was given. The equipment has been in continuous operation for 1 year, and the vacancy rate of diamond grits in the orderly arranged diamond green segment produced by this additive manufacturing equipment is less than 5%.",

These scaffolds are encapsulated in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and removed using organic solvents. The open channels that remain after removal are filled in with a ferrofluid to render the structure magnetically sensitive. A three-point flexural test shows that introducing a channel in this way only reduces the flexural modulus of the PDMS by a factor ∼8%. We perform magnetic deflection experiments on samples with three different channel diameters. Our results show a linear dependence between applied magnetic field strength and deflection. We also find that there is a minimum magnetic field strength that needs to be applied to achieve deflection. These results suggest that there is a minimum yield stress, beyond which deflection will occur. We perform experiments on a more complex channel geometry to find that there are multiple modes of deflection. A rational approach to channel design may enable us to tune the mechanical response and direct these actuators to undergo complex motion.",

To achieve this goal, a finite element simulation model is exploited to simulate the collision situation of reinforced thin-walled tubes. The design of reinforced tubes can be formulated into a multiparameter and multiobjective optimization problem, which can be solved using the well-known non-linear programming by quadratic Lagrangian (NLPQL) optimization method. Three types of TPMS-based tubes and two multicell tubes are compared under the same conditions to show the effectiveness of our method. Through the methods mentioned above, TPMS-reinforced tubes are found to be superior in crashworthiness. This means that the safety performance of the automobiles with lighter weight can be effectively improved. The optimal parameters of three types of TPMS-reinforced tubes under different conditions were obtained, providing the foundations and references for subsequent related studies. In addition, TPMS is first explored in the design of crashworthiness for automobiles in this article. Due to the controllability and implicit functional expression of TPMSs, TPMS-reinforced tubes can be easily controlled and optimized. Meanwhile, it is easy to manufacture them by three-dimensional printing technologies.",

    "abstract": "Biocompatible scaffolds are porous matrices that are bone substitutes with great potential in tissue regeneration. For this, these scaffolds need to have bioactivity and biodegradability. From this perspective, 3D printing presents itself as one of the techniques with the greatest potential for scaffold manufacturing with porosity and established structure, based on 3D digital modeling. Thus, the objective of the present work was to produce 3D scaffolds from the poly (lactic acid) (PLA) and the nanostructured hydroxyapatite doped with carbonate ions (CHA). For this purpose, filaments were produced via fusion for the fused-filament 3D printing and used to produce scaffolds with 50% porosity in the cubic shape and 0/90°configuration. The dispersive energy spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis demonstrated the presence of CHA in the polymeric matrix, confirming the presence and incorporation into the composite. The thermogravimetric analysis made it possible to determine that the filler concentration incorporated in the matrix was very similar to the proposed percentage, indicating that there were no major losses in the process of obtaining the filaments. It can be assumed that the influence of CHA as a filler presents better mechanical properties up to a certain amount. The biological results point to a great potential for the application of PLA/CHA scaffolds in bone tissue engineering with effective cell adhesion, proliferation, biocompatibility, and no cytotoxicity effects.",

    "abstract": "Biomass materials, an important source of chemical feedstocks, could replace fossil fuels as a resource in the future. The chemical feedstocks from biomass materials are used in many medical and pharmaceutical products and in fuels, chemicals, and functional materials. Biomass materials are expected to be used in biomedical engineering fields, especially due to their low biotoxicity. By the way, most of the demand for bio-application fields is an application targeted for customized production, so a high formability is required for production. Research on three-dimensional (3D) printing technology capable of satisfying these requirements has been ongoing. Manufacturing additives need to be investigated to use biomass materials as a resin or bioink safely for 3D printing, which is a technique widely used in biomedical engineering fields. In this study, a projection microstereolithography (PμSL) system, a 3D printing technique, was made that uses a biomass-based resin. Biomass materials are designed to be photocurable for use in the PμSL process. Various PμSL process parameters were investigated using the biomass-based resin to determine the optimum fabrication conditions for 3D structures. This study demonstrated that a biomass-based resin can be used in the PμSL process. We provide a method for its application in various biomedical engineering fields.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of interest toward concrete digital fabrication reflects the current aspiration for better, smarter, faster, and greener construction means. Among a broad variety of techniques developed by our community, digital casting presents clear advantages regarding dimensional precision, geometrical freedom, and surface finish of the produced elements. In contrast to robotic slip forming, the usage of digitally fabricated formworks requires simpler equipment. It, however, calls for easily shaped formworks, typically best three-dimensional (3D) printed, for example, by fused deposition modeling. While such molds can be easily fabricated with a wide range of commercially off-the-shelf available 3D printers, a shortcoming is the susceptibility of many polymers to environmental stress cracking, particularly when in contact with high pH solutions typical for cementitious materials. This article confirms the problem posed by this type of environmental stress cracking and presents two very effective means of circumventing it: A silicone coating and cyclic olefin copolymer. Apart from this, in the specific case of counterpressure casting (CPC), hydrostatic pressure must be resisted by a powder bed surrounding the formwork. The efficiency of such beds is examined and a particular mixture of sand and lead is shown to be particularly effective, provided its density is regulated to balance stress principles derived from soil mechanics. Presented applications include the successful CPC of thin prismatic formworks with a concrete height up to 3 m as representative of typical interfloor load-bearing elements. The combination of counterpressure and stress control is shown to be essential for such achievement, highlighting the potential of this approach as a viable member of the concrete digital casting family.",

The proposed FE model contains a series of toolpath information that is directly converted from a G-code file, including hatch spacing, laser power, layer thickness, dwell time, and scanning speed generated by using Slic3r software from a CAD file. A proposed multi-layer, multi-track FE model is used to investigate the influence of the laser power, scanning speed, and scanning path on the microstructure in the Ti-6Al-4V plate built via SLM. The processing window is also determined based on the proposed FE model. The FE results indicate that, with a decrease in the laser power and an increase in the scanning speed, the morphology of the crystal grains, showing fully columnar crystals, gradually deviates from the fully equiaxed region. The formed grains are dependent on the laser power, scanning speed, and deposition position, but they are not sensitive to the scanning path, and with the deposition from the bottom layer to the top layer, the size of the formed grains is gradually increasing, which shows a good agreement with the experimental results.",

Numerical simulations were conducted to collect the local fracture strain at the critical position where the failure happened for all specimens. By comparing with Ti64 alloy manufactured by different techniques, the failure behavior of LMD Ti64 alloy shows a stronger sensitivity to Lode angle parameter and strain rate. The role of initial defects in failure was discussed. It is found that high laser power and overlap ratio can improve the failure behavior by reducing the number of initial defects. The initial defects on the fracture surface at much higher strain rates were observed, indicating that the initial crack rather than initial void acts as the crack growth point leading to the final fracture at higher strain rates. The scanning electron microscope observation of the fracture surface shows that the failure mechanism of LMD Ti64 alloy varies from different stress states and strain rates. The failure mechanism is characterized by the shear fracture at the negative stress triaxiality, whereas the void growth fracture plays a dominant role in the failure mechanism of LMD Ti64 alloy at a high stress triaxiality on the quasi-static loading condition.",

To address the above problems, this article proposed an improved You Only Look Once version 3 (YOLOv3) algorithm to detect the surface defects of metal AM based on multispectrum. The weighted k-means algorithm is used to cluster the target samples to improve the matching degree between the prior frame and the feature layer. The network structure of YOLOv3 is modified by using the lightweight MobileNetv3 to replace the Darknet-53 in the original YOLOv3 algorithm. Dilated convolution and Inceptionv3 are added to improve the detection capability for surface defects. A multispectrum measuring system was also developed to obtain the AM surface data with defects for experimental verification. The results show that the detection accuracy in the test set by YOLOv3-MobileNetv3 network is 11% higher than that by the original YOLOv3 network on average. The detection accuracy for cracking defects of the three types of defects is significantly increased by 23.8%, and the detection speed is also increased by 18.2%. The experimental results show that the improved YOLOv3 algorithm realizes the end-to-end surface defect detection for metal AM with high accuracy and fast speed, which can be further applied for online defect detection.",

These architectures successfully exhibited enhanced conductivity ∼20 times higher than alginate hollow microfibers without any significant change in the inner dimension of the hollow region (220.0 ± 10.0 μm) compared with pure alginate hollow microfibers. In the presence of graphene, higher specific surface permeability, active ion adsorption sites, and shorter pathways were created.

The deposits caused by low viscosity and the agglomerations resulting from the nonuniform mixing form the obstacles in the channel, which affect the normal flow of the slurry, theoretical outlet velocity, and interaction with other printing parameters. Therefore, it is necessary to study the effect mechanism of the obstacles on the flow. The obstacles are always irregular, which makes it difficult to directly analyze them. Irregular geometries are always composed of linear and/or arcuate elements; therefore, the obstacles can be simplified into regular geometries. In the present work, interactive elements, including line-line, line-arc, arc-arc situations are analyzed. Then, an improved multiple relaxation time lattice Boltzmann method (MRT LBM) with a pseudo external force is proposed for the flow analysis. The improved MRT LBM is combined with rheological test data to investigate cases with interactive elements, and the results are applied to reveal the general mechanism. The results show that the positions are common influencing factors, which affect the streamlines, outflow directions, and outlet velocity distributions. In addition, in different situations, different factors are considered to affect SiC slurry flow. It is obvious that the existed obstacles inevitably change the theoretical flow direction and outlet velocity, which has a synergistic effect on the printing parameters. It is necessary to understand the effect mechanism of the obstacles on the flow.",

Currently, most medical models are created using image thresholding and traditional mesh-based segmentation techniques to produce mono-material boundaries (STL file formats) of anatomical features. Existing medical modeling manufacturing methods restrict shape specification to one material or density, which result in anatomically simple 3D printed medical models with no gradated material qualities. Currently, available high-resolution functionally graded multimaterial 3D printed medical models are rigid and do not represent biomechanical movement. To bypass the identified limitations of current 3D printing medical modeling workflows, we present a bitmap-based \"voxel\" multimaterial additive manufacturing workflow for the production of highly realistic and flexible anatomical models of the neonatal lower limb using computed tomographic (\"CT\") data. By interpolating and re-slicing a biomedical volumetric data set at the native 3D printer z resolution of 27 μm and using CT scan attenuation properties (Hounsfield units) to guide material mixing ratios, producing highly realistic models of the neonatal lower limb at a significantly faster rate than other manufacturing methods. The presented medical modeling workflow has considerable potential to improve medical modeling manufacturing methods by translating medical data directly into 3D printing files aiding in anatomical education and surgical simulation practices, especially in neonatal research and clinical training.",

Better bipolar plates can lead to a significant reduction in size, cost, and weight of fuel cells. Herein, we report on the use of photoresin 3D printing to fabricate alternative bipolar plates for operating self-breathing fuel cell stacks. The resulting stack made of 12 self-breathing PEMFCs achieved a power density of 0.3 W/cm2 under ambient conditions (25°C and 20% relative humidity), which is superior to the performance of previously reported self-breathing cells.

Three-dimensional (3D)-printable tissue-mimicking hydrogels can offer an alternative, where control of the biophysical properties of the materials can be achieved. Hydrogel-based systems that can recreate complex 3D structures and channels with diameters <500 μm are challenging to produce. We present a noncytotoxic photo-responsive hydrogel that supports 3D printing of complex 3D structures with microchannels down to 150 μm in diameter. Fine tuning of the 3D-printing process has allowed the production of complex structures, where for demonstration purposes we present a helical channel with diameters between 250 and 370 μm around a central channel of 150 μm in diameter in materials with mechanical and acoustic properties that closely replicate those of tissue. The ability to control and accurately reproduce the complex features of the microvasculature has value across a wide range of biomedical applications, especially when the materials involved accurately mimic the physical properties of tissue. An approach that is additionally cell compatible provides a unique setup that can be exploited to study aspects of biomedical research with an unprecedented level of accuracy.",

    "abstract": "The recent developments in multiaxis three-dimensional (3D) printing have got a large potential for expanding the capability of material extrusion based methods. Especially curved and nonplanar methods can improve buildability, surface quality, and mechanical performance. However, the challenges that arise from using them complicate their deployment. In this article, we propose a hybrid planar method, based on varying the layer height and deposition speed in combination with tool reorientation, that allows us to get a lot of the same benefits that come from using nonplanar layers. The goal of the method is to keep the deposition constant regardless of the overhang angle. This is achieved by simultaneous control of layer height, deposition speed, and tool orientation. The method is the most beneficial for large-scale, single-wall 3D printing, such as clay, concrete, and other composites. The main restriction of the method depends on the minimum/maximum ratio between the nozzle diameter and layer height. A description of the method is provided, and sample objects are evaluated either as trajectories or as test prints. The claims are confirmed by microscopy measurement of the contact patch width. The method as presented allows printing of overhangs up to 82.34°, can be applied to complex geometry without difficulties, and further possibilities of limit expansion are discussed. The contact patch width decreases only by 20% at the 80° of overhang.",

A ferromagnetic 3D printing filament is prepared by the mixture of neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) and polylactic acid (PLA), and we investigate the characteristics of the ferromagnetic filament by mixing ratio, magnetic properties, mechanical properties, and rheological properties through experiments. By thermal extrusion of the ferromagnetic filament through a 3D printer nozzle, various thicknesses (80–500 μm) and lengths (less than ∼5 cm) of ferromagnetic microfibers are achieved with different printing setups, such as filament extrusion amount and printing speed. The printed ferromagnetic microfibers are magnetized to maintain a permanent magnetic dipole moment, and 4D printing can be achieved by the deformations of the permanently magnetized microfibers under magnetic fields. We observe that the mixing ratio, the thickness, and the length of the magnetized microfibers provide distinct deformation of the microfiber for customization of 4D printings. This study exhibits that the permanently magnetized microfibers have a great potential for smart sensors and actuators. Furthermore, we briefly present an application of our proposed magnetic microfibers for bionic motion actuators with various unique undulating and oscillating motions.",

This new concept of printing three-dimensional (3D) objects opens the possibility for solving processing issues, through the production of complex geometries that can undergo programmed temporal changes in response to external stimuli. However, as 4D technology emerges from AM, various challenges still need to be explored, such as the controlled morphing effect. Understanding the aspects related to this behavior, both at the macroscopic level of the structure and at the microscopic level of the polymeric chain, is fundamental. Focused on thermoplastic poly(lactic acid) (PLA) printed by fused deposition modeling, this review addressed the influence of molecular weight, polymeric chain modifications, and 3D printing parameters on the shape change effect of a PLA-based material. The glass transition temperature proved to be a highly important parameter, which can be modified by molecular weight changes. Nozzle temperature, fill density, print patterns, and raster angle are 3D printing parameters that influence the material shape change. Shape recovery is highly dependent on the recovery temperature. Potential applications for shape memory structures are also addressed in this review.",

    "abstract": "The development of innovative production processes and the optimization of photobioreactors play an important role in generating industrial competitive production technologies for phototrophic biofilms. With emerse photobioreactors a technology was introduced that allowed efficient surface attached cultivation of terrestrial cyanobacteria. However, the productivity of emerse photobioreactors depends on the available cultivation surface. By the implementation of biocarriers to the bioreactor volume, the cultivation surface can be increased which potentially improves productivity and thus the production of valuable compounds. To investigate the surface attached cultivation on biocarriers new photobioreactors need to be developed. Additive manufacturing (AM) offers new opportunities for the design of photobioreactors but producing the needed transparent parts can be challenging using AM techniques. In this study an emerse fixed bed photobioreactor was designed for the use of biocarriers and manufactured using different AM processes. To validate the suitability of the photobioreactor for phototrophic cultivation, the optical properties of three-dimensional (3D)-printed transparent parts and postprocessing techniques to improve luminous transmittance of the components were investigated. We found that stereolithography 3D printing can produce parts with a high luminous transmittance of over 85% and that optimal postprocessing by sanding and clear coating improved the clarity and transmittance to more than 90%. Using the design freedom of AM resulted in a bioreactor with reduced part count and improved handling. In summary, we found that modern 3D-printing technologies and materials are suitable for the manufacturing of functional photobioreactor prototypes.",

The processes have been optimized to improve mechanical performance of the manufactured parts. Nevertheless, properties of components made by means of injection molding could not be reached yet. In the study at hand, ultrasonic phase spectroscopy (UPS) is used to compare the elastic properties of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene specimens manufactured by injection molding, by fused filament fabrication, and the Arburg plastic freeforming process. UPS allows a nondestructive and prompt determination of the elastic modulus and allows evaluation of the mechanical properties in every direction in space. In the end, results of UPS are compared with properties derived by uniaxial tensile tests to validate UPS as a test method for the determination of the mechanical properties of polymers. Regardless of the manufacturing process, an approximately linear dependence of the elastic moduli on the density can be determined. Furthermore, the quasistatic properties of the injection molded samples consistently exhibit the mechanical properties of the other samples by at least 10%.",

However, such three-dimensional printed metallized electrical components inevitably have processing errors that affect their performance. It is vital to understand defects' effects on the performance of the final product. In this study, we simulated micro-computed tomography (CT) data. A spiral cavity is printed by stereolithography and spiral inductors with different numbers of turns are fabricated by injecting Gallium Indium liquid metal (EGaIn). Through the theoretical simulation of the spiral inductor and the characterization of the electrical performance, we found that the relative error in the simulation of 2.5-turn, 4.5-turn, and 6.5-turn spiral inductors is +30.6%, +13%, and +6%, respectively, compared with the experimental data. The CT data are obtained by a CT scanning microcoil and a reconstruction model with real structural features is established based on the data. The results show that the relative error between the reconstructed model with real defects and the experimental data is +10.4%, -3.7%, and -1.5%, respectively, which is closer to the experimental data. According to the CT data simulation that provides a more accurate theoretical prediction, the actual effect of a defect on the final product can be assessed. The difference between the experimental results and the theoretical simulation can be inferred from the reconstruction model.",

As the layer thickness increased, the density of the printed WPC part decreased significantly, while the dimensional stability of the water-immersed WPC part decreased. In addition, specific tensile properties increased and the other specific mechanical properties (flexural, compressive, and shear properties) decreased with increasing layer thickness. Furthermore, scanning electronic microscopy micrographs illustrated that the number of voids and defects was more often observed on the surface of the WPC part printed with higher layer thickness. Therefore, these results indicated that the different layer thicknesses in FFF manufacturing have a substantial impact on the dimensional stability and specific mechanical properties of the FFF-printed WPC part.",

The responses involved a range of 3D printer users from amateur makers to conglomerate manufacturers creating personal protective equipment (PPE) and other supplies of which there were shortages. These new supply chains resulted from the democratization of 3D printing, open source file sharing, mass production of desktop machines, and the relatively cheap cost of 3D printers. The democratized state of 3D printing facilitated an altruistic movement of makers with ranging experience, to work alongside traditional manufacturers to make medical supplies. With the critical nature of the shortages and the sharp increase in COVID-19 infections, many standards and regulations were bypassed, and good manufacturing processes disregarded, in cases. The outcomes from this article is a set of six lessons learned from the authors perspective regarding the use of 3D printing during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. We note challenges experienced around volume manufacturing, infection control requirements of produced parts and the cleanability of devices, mechanical strength considerations, good manufacturing practices, product and intellectual property (IP) liability, and the role of involving clinical stakeholders.",

Orthographic images and root structures of a healthy upper maxilla central incisor in determined volumes and sizes were drawn as a prototype with the aid of computer software. Using the same software, an IRR defect was also modeled. These two images were then transferred to the AutoDesk Fusion 360 3D modeling program (AutoDesk, San Rafael, CA) for meshing. Afterward, the tooth model was transferred to a 3D modeling and prototyping program (RhinoCeros 3D; Robert McNells & Assoc., New York) and printed on a 3D printer. Eighty replicas with IRR were manufactured and divided into four groups (n = 20 per group) according to the obturating techniques as follows: Group 1: Cold lateral compaction (CLC), Group 2: Core Carrier System (GuttaCore), Group 3: Injectable Cold Filling (GuttaFlow® BioSeal), and Group 4: Continuous Wave Obturation System (Elements Free). After root canal filling, replicas were scanned with a high-resolution micro-computed tomography system (SkyScan 1172; Bruker-microCT, Kontich, Belgium), data regarding voids (unobturated areas) inside the IRR defects were statistically analyzed using nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis tests. A pairwise comparison between the tested groups showed that Groups 3 and 4 had significantly fewer voids compared with Groups 1 and 2 in IRR defects (p < 0.05). Group 1/Group 2 and Group 3/Group 4 had similar results in terms of voids and there were no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05). The injectable cold filling system (GuttaFlow BioSeal) and the injectable continuous wave obturation system (Elements Free) successfully obturated the pathological IRR irregularities when compared with CLC and core carrier (GuttaCore) systems.",

This decreases mechanical strength and introduces upper limits to the attainable loading fraction of the magnetic powder. The present study investigated the mechanical properties and provided an insight into the residual induction, of loading fractions between 10% and 90% of spherical and flake powders when producing PMs using SLS. The maximum attainable loading fractions were 80%/vol and 70%/vol for the flake and spherical powders, respectively. The PMs produced from the flakes reached a maximum density and residual induction at 50%/vol loading fraction. The PMs produced from spherical powder reached maximum density and residual induction at 70%/vol loading fraction; however, a knee point at 30%/vol loading fraction demonstrated only minor improvements to density (8.8%) and residual induction (13.4%) with further increases in loading fraction. Although PMs produced from flakes demonstrated superior mechanical properties, the elastic modulus and strain limit rapidly decreased with increases in powder loading fraction for both powder types. This study demonstrated the application-specific balance between mechanical and magnetic strength that must be considered when producing PMs by using SLS.",

    "abstract": "A necessity to distinguish between the influence of powder shape and size (particle size distribution) is especially demanding for highly filled metal powder feedstocks employed in additive manufacturing and powder injection molding. As their processability is evaluated through rheological behavior, the study focuses on the effect of powder size/shape on a wall slip, which is a typical phenomenon determining flow performance of these materials. Water and gas atomized 17-4PH stainless steel powders with D50 of about 3 and 20 μm are admixed into a binder containing low-density polyethylene, ethylene vinyl acetate, and paraffin wax. Mooney analysis to intercept the slip velocity of 55 vol. % filled compounds reveals that wall slip effect appears to vary significantly with size and shape of metal powders-round shaped and large particles are the most prone to the wall slip. However, the evaluation is affected by the type of the flow streams resulting from the geometry of the dies-conical dies reduce the slip up to 60% in case of fine and round particles.",

It is based on the techniques of thermographic signal reconstruction (TSR), thermal contrast, and the physical principles of heat transfer. The subsurface defects have different infill, depth, and size. The results obtained from this algorithm are compared with state-of-the-art TSR technique and show the high performance of the proposed algorithm even for subsurface defects done by 3D AM. The resulting images are better shown using the absolute difference in the place of variance. The proposed algorithm has higher contrast, better sensitivity to the defect depths, and lower noise than the TSR. The resultant image is quite clean and gives no doubt where the subsurface defects are.",

    "abstract": "Selective inhibition sintering (SIS) process is a relatively new additive manufacturing technology that builds parts on a layer-by-layer basis. This new process has been of high interest in recent years. The principal idea of the SIS process for metallic parts is based on the retardation of selected segments of each powder layer from sintering. In this process, the inhibitor, which is an inorganic salt solution or a carbohydrate solution (sucrose), is printed on the boundary of each metal powder layer cross-section to form the green part. During bulk sintering, the inhibitor decomposes to second-phase particles. The decomposed solid particles cover the surface of affected metal powder particles and exert a retarding force on the surface movement, which results in sintering retardation in the printed sections. In this article, the effects of inhibitor and sintering conditions on the SIS process for bronze were investigated. Retardation from sintering was studied for bronze inhibited by sucrose through the SIS process. The mechanical properties of the printed and nonprinted sections under different sintering conditions were characterized by the aid of design of experiments methodology. The characterizations were conducted by measuring the mechanical properties of metallic parts under different sintering temperature and sintering time. Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy techniques were used to study the printed sections after sintering.",

A machine learning approach, back-propagation neural network with a genetic algorithm (GA-BPNN) optimized by k-fold cross-validation, is proposed to monitor the operating states and predict the compressive properties. Vibration and current sensors are used in situ to monitor the operating states of the filament feeder, and a set of features are extracted and selected from raw sensor data in time and frequency domains. Results show that the operating states of the filament feeder significantly affected the compressive properties of the fabricated samples, the operating states were accurately recognized with 96.3% rate, and compressive properties were successfully predicted by the GA-BPNN.

In the manufacture of pieces using Open-Source 3D printing it is very common to use a range of infill patterns and densities with the aim of reducing printing time and material consumption. However, it is not well understood how these factors influence the characteristics of the pieces obtained. Due to the differences with FDM technology, it is necessary to evaluate the strength of the pieces manufactured with this technology. In this work, the influence of two controllable variables, such as pattern and density of the infill has been evaluated. A series of test pieces with different density characteristics and infill patterns were produced using an open-source 3D printer. The results obtained show that the influence of the different printing patterns causes a variation of less than 5% in maximum tensile strength, although the behavior is similar. The change in infill density determines mainly the tensile strength. The combination of a rectilinear pattern in a 100% infill shows the higher tensile strength, with a value of 36.4 Mpa, with a difference of less than 1% from raw ABS material.",

Recently, rapid advances in printing processes and materials development for 3D printing have allowed the printing of smart materials or multimaterials designed to change function or shape.

The printer is composed of scalable modular elements able to operate at the high temperatures required to process glass from a molten state to an annealed product. We demonstrate a process enabling the construction of 3D parts as described by computer-aided design models. Processing parameters such as temperature, which control glass viscosity, and flow rate, layer height, and feed rate can thus be adjusted to tailor printing to the desired component, its shape, and its properties. We explored, defined, and hard-coded geometric constraints and coiling patterns as well as the integration of various colors into the current controllable process, contributing to a new design and manufacturing space. We report on performed characterization of the printed materials executed to determine their morphological, mechanical, and optical properties. Printed parts demonstrated strong adhesion between layers and satisfying optical clarity. This molten glass 3D printer demonstrates the production of parts that are highly repeatable, enable light transmission, and resemble the visual and mechanical performance of glass constructs that are conventionally obtained. Utilizing the optical nature of glass, complex caustic patterns were created by projecting light through the printed objects. The 3D-printed glass objects described here can thus be extended to implementations across scales and functional domains including product and architectural design. This research lies at the intersection of design, engineering, science, and art, representing a highly interdisciplinary approach.",

Limited research in the area of recycling has been produced, yet there are several recycling machines being developed for home use. Despite this work there is no published mechanical data on components produced with filament recycled from 3D printed parts. There is very limited data on mechanical properties of any 3D printed materials. This article compares the properties of parts 3D printed with virgin polylactic acid (PLA) to those printed with recycled PLA. Using commercially available PLA and an entry level 3D printer, tensile and shear specimens were produced and then tested for tensile yield strength, modulus of elasticity, shear yield strength, and hardness. The specimens were then ground up and re-extruded into filament, and a second set of specimens were produced and tested using this recycled PLA filament. Mechanical testing showed that 3D printing with recycled PLA is a viable option. With the recycled filament, tensile strength decreased 10.9%, shear strength increased 6.8%, and hardness decreased 2.4%. The tensile modulus of elasticity was statistically unchanged. Although the average mechanical properties before and after recycling were similar, there was more variability in the results of the recycled filament. Additionally, when printing with the recycled filament there was some nozzle clogging, while none occurred with the virgin filament. Overall, the mechanical properties of specimens 3D printed from recycled PLA filament were similar to virgin properties, encouraging further development in the area of recycling 3D printed filament.",

Hence, efficient concrete construction methods are one of the main foci of research in architecture, civil engineering, and material science. One recent development that promises to achieve this goal is the use of digital fabrication for building components. Most investigations focus on direct extrusion 3D printing with concrete, which has already been covered in several review articles. Conversely, this article reviews a different approach, which focuses on the indirect digital fabrication of concrete through 3D printed formworks. This approach is under investigation for structural and nonstructural, as well as for on- and off-site applications, with a number of projects having already been built, but a comprehensive review of 3D printed formworks has not yet been compiled to synthesize the findings. This article provides a comprehensive map of the state-of-the-art of five different 3D printing technologies used for the fabrication of formworks so far. The aim is to serve as a fundamental reference for future research, provide a basis for consistent language in this field, and support the development of construction standards. The article further discusses the new geometric possibilities with 3D printed formworks and their potential for making concrete construction more sustainable. In addition, the opportunities and challenges of 3D printed formworks are evaluated in the context of other traditional and digital fabrication tools. A synthetic classification in five functional typologies is proposed and illustrated with 30 representative case studies. Finally, the article concludes with a brief reflection on the role of 3D printing in the broader context of formwork innovation and a possible outlook for this technology.",

By utilizing multimaterial 3D printing technologies and anisotropic material compositions, we can physically program hygroscopic materials such as wood to precisely sense and self-transform based on fluctuations in the environment. While wood remains one of the most common building materials in use today, it is still predominantly designed to be industrially standardized rather than taking advantage of its inherent anisotropic properties. This research aims to enhance wood's anisotropic and hygroscopic properties by designing and 3D printing custom wood grain structures to promote tunable self-transformation. In this article we present new methods for designing hygroscopic wood transformations and custom techniques for energy activation. A differentiated printing method promotes wood transformation solely through the design of custom-printed wood fibers. Alternatively, a multimaterial printing method allows for greater control and intensified wood transformations through the precise design of multimaterial prints composed of both synthetic wood and polymers. The presented methods, techniques, and material tests demonstrate the first successful results of differentiated printed wood for self-transforming behavior, suggesting a new approach for programmable material and responsive architectures.",

Long-term regeneration of normal anatomic structure, shape, and function is clinically important subsequent to bone trauma, tumor, infection, nonunion after fracture, or congenital abnormality. Due to the great complexity in structure and properties of bone across the population, along with variation in the type of injury or defect, currently available treatments for larger bone defects that support load often fail in replicating the anatomic shape and structure of the lost bone tissue. 3DP could provide the ability to print bone substitute materials with a controlled chemistry, shape, porosity, and topography, thus allowing printing of personalized bone grafts customized to the patient and the specific clinical condition. 3DP and related fabrication approaches of bone grafts may one day revolutionize the way clinicians currently treat bone defects. This article gives a brief overview of the current advances in 3DP and existing materials with an emphasis on ceramics used for 3DP of bone scaffolds. Furthermore, it addresses some of the current limitations of this technique and discusses potential future directions and strategies for improving fabrication of personalized artificial bone constructs.",

A high-contrast digital micro display with a pixel size of 15 μm was used to project customized 405 nm images through a borosilicate glass plate coated with optically clear polytetrafluoroethylene to induce polymerization in a variety of acrylate-based photocurable polymeric resins, where each layer contained multiple resin types. The new minimal-waste material exchange mechanism involves an air jet to remove residual liquid resin attached to the substrate after each exposure, which eliminated the need to use cleaning solutions that have been known to damage printed features. Complex, multimaterial microlattice structures were printed about 58% faster than existing studies that used cleaning solutions. Mechanical tests of tensile specimens demonstrated that the printing process formed sufficiently strong bonds between differing materials. The multimaterial capabilities of the new system, demonstrated as proof-of-concept in this article using photocurable polymer varieties, open doors for potential high-resolution high-efficiency multimaterial fabrication of a broad range of microarchitectures with novel functionalities and optimized performance made of ceramic, metallic, and biomaterials that find applications in the fields of metamaterials, bioinspired soft robotics, biodevices, microelectromechanical systems, optics, and microfluidics.

    "abstract": "Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is the most common and widespread additive manufacturing (AM) technique, but it requires the formation of filament. Fused granular fabrication (FGF), where plastic granules are directly three-dimensional (3D) printed, has become a promising technique for the AM technology. FGF could be a key driver to promote further greening of distributed recycling thanks to the reduced melt solidification steps and elimination of the filament extruder system. However, only large-scale FGF systems have been tested for technical and economic viability of recycling plastic materials. The objective of this work is to evaluate the performance of the FFF and FGF techniques in terms of technical and economical dimensions at the desktop 3D printing scale. Recycled and virgin polylactic acid material was studied by using five different types of recycling feedstocks: commercial filament, pellets, distributed filament, distributed pellets, and shredded waste. The results showed that the mechanical properties from the FGF technique using same configurations showed no statistical differences to FFF samples. Nevertheless, the granulometry could have an influence on the reproducibility of the samples, which explains that the critical factor in this technology is to assure the material input in the feeding system. In addition, FGF costs per kg of material were reduced to less than 1 €/kg compared with more than 20 €/kg for commercial recycled filament. These results are encouraging to foster FGF printer diffusion among heavy users of 3D printers because of reducing the cost associated to the filament fabrication while ensuring the technical quality. This indicates the possibility of a new type of 3D printing recycled plastic waste that is more likely to drive a circular economy and distributed recycling.",

    "abstract": "Concrete is a material favored by architects and builders alike due to its high structural strength and its ability to take almost any form. However, to shape concrete structures, heavy-duty formwork is usually necessary to support the fresh concrete while curing. To expand geometrical freedom, three-dimensional (3D) printed concrete formwork has emerged as a field of research. This article presents one possible application, a novel fabrication process that combines large-scale robotic fused deposition modeling 3D printing with simultaneous casting of a fast-hardening, set-on-demand concrete. This fabrication process, known as “Eggshell,” enables the production of nonstandard concrete structures in a material-efficient process. By casting a fast-hardening concrete in a continuous process, lateral pressure exerted by the fresh concrete is kept to a minimum. In this way, a 1.5-mm-thin thermoplastic shell can be used as a formwork, without any additional support. Geometries of different scales are tested in this article to evaluate the feasibility of the Eggshell fabrication process in an architectural context. An array of printing materials are also tested, and several different reinforcement concepts are analyzed. The findings are used to produce a full-scale architectural demonstrator project. This article shows that a wide range of concrete geometries can be produced in a material-efficient fabrication process, paving the way toward mass customization and structural optimization within concrete architecture.",

    "abstract": "Optimization techniques developed for additive manufacturing (AM) to maximize the structural stiffness of printed parts are often computationally expensive reformulations of classical procedures that do not typically consider the mechanical behavior introduced to the printed part by the AM fabrication process, which is layer-based, and result in pieces with significant anisotropy. The misalignment of filament orientation and structural action negates the potential benefits of optimization. Addressing this problem, this article presents a two-part research approach exploring a new method of material deposition called Stress Line Additive Manufacturing (SLAM), which deposits filament along paths derived from principal stress lines. The proposed method unifies the design and optimization of the geometry and filament layout of AM-produced parts, and is compatible to the operational characteristics of fused deposition modeling (FDM). Experimentally validating the structural significance of oriented filament, the first part of the research implements SLAM on a commercial platform for planar design cases. Ongoing research to adapt SLAM for complex 2.5D surface geometries using a six-axis industrial robot arm and a custom-designed heated extruder is then presented in Implementation 2: Robot-Enabled SLAM for 2.5-D Cases.

    "abstract": "Despite many advances, most three-dimensional (3D) printers today remain in the realm of rapid prototyping, rarely being used for manufacturing. Currently, the greatest challenges to advancing 3D printing technology are small build volumes, long print times, and limited material properties. In this article, we present rapid liquid printing (RLP) as a solution to these challenges. RLP is an experimental process that uses a tank of granular gel as a reusable support medium to greatly increase the speed, size, and material properties in 3D printing. The RLP machine can freely print in any direction, rather than layer by layer, depositing liquid material into the granular gel to form 3D structures. The RLP deposition system can use any one- or two-part material that is photo or chemically cured, expanding the range of possible materials to include high-quality industrial-grade rubbers, foams, and plastics, among many others. It is platform independent and can be implemented on any computer numerically controlled machine, robotic arm, or similar fabrication machine. In our research, we demonstrate the possible range of scales, printing both small- and large-scale objects ranging from inches to many feet. In addition to scale, RLP is fast, capable of printing a complex object in seconds to minutes rather than hours or days. In this article, we outline the three major components in the system: the control platform, deposition system, and granular gel. In addition, we explain our materials research and outline the primary steps of operation. Lastly, we present our results by comparing prints from an RLP machine with a stereolithography printer. With a combination of speed, scale, and a wide range of materials, RLP is an ideal platform for researchers, designers, and manufacturers to quickly print large-scale products with high-quality, industrial-grade materials.",

Here, hierarchical machine learning (HML) is applied to 3D printing of silicone elastomer via freeform reversible embedding (FRE), which is challenging because it involves depositing a Newtonian prepolymer liquid phase within a Bingham plastic support bath. The advantage of the HML algorithm is that it can predict the behavior of complex physical systems using sparse data sets through integration of physical modeling in a framework of statistical learning. Here, it is shown that this algorithm can be used to simultaneously optimize material, formulation, and processing variables. The FRE method for 3D printing silicone parts was optimized based on a training set with 38 trial runs. Compared with the previous results from iterative optimization approaches using design-of-experiment and steepest-ascent methods, HML increased printing speed by up to 2.5 × while retaining print fidelity and also identified a unique silicone formulation and printing parameters that had not been found previously through trial-and-error approaches. These results indicate that HML is an effective tool with the potential for broad application for planning and optimizing in additive manufacturing of soft materials via the FRE method.",

    "abstract": "Additively manufactured cellular structures represent a promising engineering design concept for making customized products where user-specific mechanical properties are required. One of the major challenges in the additive manufacturing (AM) process is removal of unwanted support structures from the lattice. The support structure consumes extra material, printing time, and energy for manufacturing. Postprinting, it needs extensive postprocessing work to remove it from the lattice structure chemically or mechanically. In the case of flexible materials such as thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), removing the support structure from the lattice is very difficult with the material extrusion process. In this article, a new type of a shell-shaped lattice structure inspired by sea urchin (SU) morphology is designed. This lattice can be additively manufactured by material extrusion processes such as fused deposition modeling (FDM) without requiring any support structures. The mechanical properties of the proposed structure, such as stiffness and energy absorption during loading and unloading, have been evaluated as they are important for cushioning. The compressive results indicate that the stiffness property is almost twice as high compared with the benchmarked, bending-dominated, body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice structure of the same relative density and ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) foam. Energy absorption is almost equal to the BCC lattice and 20% better than EVA foam. Last, a predictive model on stiffness behavior and energy return was developed to facilitate a systematic way to select optimal densities of the SU lattice structure for energy-absorbing applications. Visual inspection has also revealed that there is no sagging or failure of the lattice, which reduced the manufacturing time and postprocessing time, saving a significant amount of material without compromising on quality. Supportless lattice printing was also validated by printing the specimen with a different FDM printer and TPU filament. A possible application for supportless lattice structures can be for AM of customized shoe midsoles at low cost, ski boots, tires, automotive crush boxes, or any other energy-absorbing structures.",

    "abstract": "Fused filament fabrication (FFF) has been widely used in various industries, and the adoption of technology is growing significantly. However, the FFF process has several disadvantages like inconsistent part quality and print repeatability. The occurrence of manufacturing-induced defects often leads to these shortcomings. This study aims to develop and implement an on-site monitoring system, which consists of a camera attached to the print head and the laptop that processes the video feed, for the extrusion-based 3D printers incorporating computer vision and object detection models to detect defects and make corrections in real-time. Image data from two classes of defects were collected to train the model. Various YOLO architectures were evaluated to study the ability to detect and classify printing anomalies such as under-extrusion and over-extrusion. Four of the trained models, YOLOv3 and YOLOv4 with \"Tiny\" variation, achieved a mean average precision score of >80% using the AP50 metric. Subsequently, two of the models (YOLOv3-Tiny 100 and 300 epochs) were optimized using Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) model conversion and ONNX Runtime to improve the inference speed. A classification accuracy rate of 89.8% and an inference speed of 70 frames per second were obtained. Before implementing the on-site monitoring system, a correction algorithm was developed to perform simple corrective actions based on defect classification. The G-codes of the corrective actions were sent to the printers during the printing process. This implementation successfully demonstrated real-time monitoring and autonomous correction during the FFF 3D printing process. This implementation will pave the way for an on-site monitoring and correction system through closed-loop feedback from other additive manufacturing (AM) processes.",

However, overhanging surfaces often require support structures to be fabricated and minimize thermally induced distortion. Unlike polymer AM processes, soluble sacrificial support materials have not been identified and characterized for metallic materials, and, as a result, support structures in 3D printed metals must be removed using additional machining operations. In this work, we demonstrate that sacrificial metal supports can be fabricated by taking advantage of differences in the chemical and electrochemical stability between different metals. As a demonstration, a stainless steel bridged structure with a 90° overhang was fabricated using a carbon steel sacrificial support that was later removed through electrochemical etching in 41 wt.% nitric acid with bubbling O2. Open circuit potentials and potentiodynamic polarization curves were gathered to verify etch selectivity. No machining, grinding, or finishing operations were required to remove the metallic supports using this approach.

Numerous works have shown potential to revolutionize the field of four-dimensional (4D) printing and active self-deploying structures. Conventional manufacturing technologies restrict the geometric complexity of active structures. 3D printing allows the fabrication of complex active structures with no assembly required. In this study, we propose active 3D printed auxetic meta-materials that are capable of achieving area changes up to 200%. With these meta-materials, we design geometrically complex active structures that can be programmed into versatile shapes and recover their original shape given an external stimulus. We simulate the proposed meta-materials based on thermoviscoelastic material properties obtained by experimental characterization. A reduced beam model is constructed to predict forces and deformations of complex active structures. Excellent correlation is found between finite element simulation and experimental data from a 3-point bending test. Rectilinear tiling of the proposed meta-materials achieves the desired shape transformation. To demonstrate versatile programming, a selected meta-material is tiled into a complex contour, programmed into an arbitrary shape, and recovers as predicted. Simulation results verify this behavior. Such programmability in conjunction with 3D printing may be further exploited for applications such as biomedical devices, civil structures, and aerospace.",

    "abstract": "The frontier in additive manufacturing has recently shifted beyond the ability to produce parts with complex geometries, to the ability to fabricate multimaterial structures. Recent work has demonstrated the capacity to 3D print structures that integrate dissimilar types of materials—such as electrical conductors and reinforcing elements along with dielectrics—enabling the rapid, custom production of highly functional electromechanical and electronic devices. This article introduces a new process, fiber encapsulation additive manufacturing (FEAM), which enables fiber and extrudable matrix material to be printed simultaneously in a single, potentially low-cost machine. One application of FEAM is the manufacturing of soft robotic components that move and sense, though a variety of other applications are contemplated. Using a prototype FEAM system, helical 3D coils/inductors of various heights and diameters were created. Leveraging this capability, a functional loudspeaker, rheostat, inductive sensor, and linear variable differential transformer were demonstrated, as well as a membrane switch array.",

The process consists of dissolving cellulose with different origins and molecular weight in an ionic liquid (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate), controlled multilayered dispensing, and coagulation. The printability was examined by studying the viscosity of cellulose solutions and by varying the settings of the printer setup regarding flow rate and needle dimensions. Water was added as a nonsolvent, enabling a coagulation process to form a gel structure of the printed solutions. By printing on a coagulating gel, the printed solutions were regenerated within a few seconds. Rheology analysis showed that higher concentrations of cellulose and cellulose of a high molecular weight were shear thinning, providing favorable printing properties. Printing 3D structures of cellulose dissolved in an ionic liquid followed by coagulation by a nonsolvent was possible. Both complex patterns of 2D structures as well as multilayered prints were created to obtain 3D structures. This novel method allows for the production of spatially tailored 3D gels or membrane structures made from cellulose.",

This study presents water-based robotic fabrication as a design approach and enabling technology for AM of biodegradable hydrogel composites. Our research focuses on the combination of expanding the dimensions of the fabrication envelope, developing structural materials for additive deposition, incorporating material-property gradients, and manufacturing architectural-scale biodegradable systems. This work presents a robotically controlled AM system to produce biodegradable-composite objects combining natural hydrogels, such as chitosan and sodium alginate, with other organic aggregates. It demonstrates the approach by designing, building, and evaluating the mechanics and controls of a multichamber extrusion system. Finally, it provides evidence of large-scale composite objects fabricated by our technology that display graded properties and feature sizes ranging from micro- to macroscale. Fabricated objects may be chemically stabilized or dissolved in water and recycled within minutes. Applications include the fabrication of fully recyclable products or temporary architectural components such as tent structures with graded mechanical and optical properties. Proposed applications demonstrate environmental capabilities such as water-storing structures, hydration-induced shape forming, and product disintegration over time.",

Furthermore, for a bottom-up projection system, the separating force must be focused. The digital light process system and bottom-up projection method have been used in this current work to create a ceramic green part. Our special design of a coating–storing–stirring recoating system tackles the problems relating to both ultrathin layers and sedimentation and it can also store the suspension to make the process more convenient. A stretch elastic separating film that diminishes the separating force and effectively reduces printing defects has also been designed. The strain forces in the improved coating process and stripping process were also analyzed. The green bodies were printed from three types of high solid loading ceramic suspensions (silica 60 vol%, alumina 60 vol%, and zirconia 52 vol%) with calculated parameters. Finally, the postprocessing of green parts was found to increase the density of ceramic components; these sintering results are presented.",

However, there is a need to get more insight in the relationship between the process parameters and the final performance.

Yet, FDM technology is also designed to produce final parts that might be used in machinery or transportation applications. In such cases, dynamic loading is the most common situation and should be considered. The present article focuses on understanding the influence of three process parameters (nozzle diameter, number of contours, and raster-to-raster air gap) on the mechanical behavior under dynamic loading at specified conditions. A dynamic mechanical analysis apparatus has been used to characterize the polycarbonate mechanical behavior. On the other hand, a Taguchi approach and an analysis of variance have been used in order to quantify the influence of the parameters on such mechanical behavior.",

Simultaneous maintenance of scaffold structural integrity and cell viability is a challenging task. In this article, we present strategies developed to bioplot alginate-based three-dimensional tissue scaffolds containing hyaluronic acid and living Schwann cells for potential use in peripheral nerve tissue engineering. The fabrication platform, upon which the scaffold is created, was coated with the polycation polyethylenimine to immobilize the first layer of the scaffold on the platform. Each layer was then dispensed into a bath containing calcium chloride to cross-link the alginate, polyvinyl alcohol, and low concentrations of polyethylenimine to improve the structural integrity of the resulting scaffolds while retaining biocompatibility. The present study illustrated that with these strategies, porous alginate/hyaluronic acid scaffolds can be fabricated with good structural integrity and long-term cell viability. Plotting method and speed were also important factors determining the printability of single-layered scaffolds. The methods developed and the results obtained from this study form the basis for a general bioplotting method by which more sophisticated alginate/hyaluronic acid scaffolds can be fabricated with the inclusion of living cells into desired structures.",

    "abstract": "This work demonstrates, for the first time, two approaches for dissolvable supports in powder bed fusion-printed metal parts. Expanding on our recent innovations with dissolvable supports in multimaterial direct energy deposition printing, this work brings dissolvable support capabilities to additive manufacturing systems that are limited to single-material builds. First, a direct dissolution approach is demonstrated with the supports electrochemically dissolved. While this process works, it is not self-terminating and maintaining dimensional accuracy for complex geometries is thus difficult. The second approach incorporates a sensitizing agent during the normal stress, relieving thermal annealing step to decrease the chemical stability of the top 100–200 μm of the component surface. The component is then etched under etching conditions with a high selectivity toward the \"sensitized\" surface over the base component material. This creates an etching process that self-terminates once the sensitized layer is removed. These two processes are first demonstrated using 17-4 PH stainless steel. Direct dissolution was conducted under anodic bias in a solution of HNO3/KCl/HCl; 120 μm of material were removed from the component's surface. For the self-terminating dissolution process, surface sensitization was done by exposing the sample to sodium hexacyanoferrate at 800°C for 6 h to carburize the top 100–200 μm of the sample. This carburization process captures the protective chromium in chromium carbide precipitates and renders the surface sensitive to chemical and electrochemical dissolution. The self-terminating etching reaction was demonstrated under anodic bias in a solution of HNO3/KCl. Open circuit potentials were measured at 10 s and 1 h, and polarization curves were used to identify the corrosion potential. Self-termination was verified by monitoring component diameter over time, and 120 μm of material were removed from the sensitized surface of the component. To further test the self-terminating sensitized approach, a set of 316 stainless steel interlocking rings were fabricated to demonstrate that this approach scales to large components with complex geometry. For these parts, this approach replaced 4–5 days of machining operations with a 32.5 h electrochemical bath.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) food printing, or food layered manufacture (FLM), is a novel application of additive manufacturing (AM) that creates a customizable meal at maximal convenience. While conventional 3D printers use plastics and metals as their base material, a 3D food printer (3DFP) uses food. Most 3DFPs do not require heat to process food since they print confectionary treats and other materials that do not require heating before consumption. Current 3DFPs that produce meals that require cooking use traditional convective or conductive methods to process food after the printing process, which limits their ability to combine multiple materials in a single food object. Integrating an infrared lamp heating mechanism into the printer allows for more precise spatial control of the heat being delivered to printed food, the ability to create complex food patterns with more ingredient complexity, and the integration of multiple food ingredients in a single 3D object. This novel approach to onboard cooking allows users to combine different ingredients—such as chicken with dough—and cook each ingredient selectively. Chefs can experiment with new food combinations and explore novel culinary innovations. The machine's ability to selectively cook and print multi-material food objects represents a significant achievement in this particular application of AM and brings users one step closer to achieving customizable meal-based FLM.",

Most published research investigates the macroscopic properties of inkjet printed parts. This work studies the mechanical properties on the micron scale, in which metallurgical sample preparation and nanoindentation have proved to be appropriate tools for investigating parts with stiffnesses ranging over three orders of magnitude. First, interfaces in single-material parts that are created through jetting of material in layers and through nozzles are investigated. Visual inspections of the samples show a uniform layer thickness for rigid materials and irregular layers for flexible materials. The hardness and modulus near the layer interfaces show similar values to those further away, indicating a uniform curing throughout the layers. Second, the on-the-fly material mixing of the printer is investigated and shows a dominating base material with elongated features induced from the secondary material. This shows that the mixing is an introduction of particles, rather than molecular mixing. As a consequence, the local material characteristics differ strongly from the global properties of printed structures. Third, interfaces of dissimilar materials are investigated and show a smooth transition in the mechanical properties from one material to another.",

The quality of AM-produced devices may consequently vary when identical parts are built using different 3D printers or even when the same 3D printer, parameters, process steps, and materials are used. In this novel study, representative materials built with stereolithography and material jetting processes were subjected to biological evaluation using the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) fish embryo test designed to determine acute toxicity of chemicals on embryonic stages of fish. The study demonstrates that the AM materials are toxic in zebrafish assays; however, the adverse effects of toxicity in some materials were reduced significantly after treatment with ethanol. Within the limitations of the study, it is evident that material composition and cleaning method are significant parameters by which the biological risks of photopolymers in 3DP can be assessed. Furthermore, the zebrafish biocompatibility assay is a reliable assessment tool for quantifying the toxicity of leachates in AM materials.",

Polyelectrolyte hydrogels produce mechanical motion in response to electrical stimulus, making them good candidates for implementation of soft actuators. However, their conventional fabrication process has so far hindered their applicability in a broad range of controlled folding behaviors. A novel application of 3D printing in biodegradable and biocompatible soft robots is presented in this study. It is observed that the contactless electroactive polyelectrolyte structures demonstrate reversible bending through polarity changes of electrodes. Edible gelatin and chitosan hydrogels are chosen as potential candidates of polyelectrolyte actuators. Actuation of 3D printed chitosan and its performance are compared with those of conventional cast film gelatin. The printing parameters are optimized for fabrication of the desired geometrical model and the printing effects on actuation performance are analyzed. It is demonstrated that the rectilinear hollows made by 3D printing improve the functionality of actuation in chitosan compared with a cast film gelatin actuator. 3D printed polyelectrolyte actuators will open a new chapter of soft biodegradable robots for preserving sustainability while offering custom geometrical, functional, and control properties.",

The combination of three-dimensional (3D) printing and electrospinning enables the fabrication of these multiscale structures.

The results show successful fabrication of a dual-scale scaffold with the 3D-printed scaffold acting as a gap collector with the printed microfibers as the electrodes and the pores a series of insulating gaps resulting in aligned nanofibers. The electrospun fibers are highly aligned perpendicular to the direction of the printed fiber and form aligned meshes within the pores of the scaffold. Mechanical testing showed no significant difference between the number of mesh layers whereas the hydrophobicity of the scaffold increased with increasing fiber density. Biological results indicate that increasing the number of mesh layers improves cell proliferation, migration, and adhesion. The aligned nanofibers within the microscale pores allowed enhanced cell bridging and cell alignment that was not observed in the 3D-printed only scaffold. These results demonstrate a facile method of incorporating low-density and aligned fibers within a 3D-printed scaffold that is a promising development in multiscale hierarchical scaffolds where alignment of cells can be desirable.",

Challenges in achieving autonomy include the following: bulky energy sources, imprecise deployment, jamming of components, and lack of structural integrity. Leveraging advances in the fields of shape memory polymers, bistability, and three-dimensional (3D) multimaterial printing, we present a 3D-printed programmable actuator that enables the autonomous deployment and shape reconfiguration of structures activated through surrounding temperature change. Using a shape memory polymer as the temperature controllable energy source and a bistable mechanism as the linear actuator and force amplifier, the structures achieve precise geometric activation and quantifiable load-bearing capacity. The proposed unit actuator integrates these two components and is designed to be assembled into larger deployable and shape reconfigurable structures. First, we demonstrate that the activation of the unit actuator can be sequenced by tailoring each shape memory polymer to a different activation time. Next, by changing the configuration of the actuator, we demonstrate an initially flat surface that transforms into a pyramid or a hyperbolic paraboloid, thus demonstrating a multistate structure. Load-bearing capability is demonstrated for both during activation and in the operating state.",

The porosity in two additively manufactured aluminum alloy (AlSi10Mg) tensile samples before and after LSP was imaged using identical X-ray tomography settings and overlap of the data was performed for direct comparison. The results indicate clearly that near-surface pores are closed by the process, while internal pores remain unaffected. LSP has become well known as a method to improve the fatigue properties of materials, including those of additively manufactured aluminum alloys. This improvement is usually attributed to the compressive residual stress induced by the process. The additional effect of closure of near-surface pores that is illustrated in this work is of interest for additive manufacturing because additive manufacturing is not yet able to produce completely pore-free components. Since the critical pore initiating fatigue cracks are always attributed to surface or subsurface pores, the closure of these pores may play an additional role in improving the fatigue properties. While more work remains to unravel the relative importance of near-surface porosity compared to the compressive residual stress effect, this work clearly shows the effect of LSP—closing of pores near the surface. For the processing conditions demonstrated here, all pores up to 0.7 mm from the surface are closed without damaging the surface, while higher peening power results in surface damage.",

This article is segmented into three parts: (1) study on the effect of 3D printing parameters on dimensional accuracy and mechanical properties of 3D-printed silicone, (2) reliability and failure analysis of 3D-printed silicone according to ASTM D575 standards under monotonic and cyclic compressive loading, and (3) cytotoxicity of 3D-printed silicone by extraction method according to ISO 10993-12 for different extraction time and extract volume/surface area ratios. Based on analysis using regression method and analysis of variance, we found that the dimensional accuracy of lengths and widths is sensitive to both nozzle diameters and bed temperatures (BTs), while the height is only sensitive to BTs. Failure results were analyzed using the two-parameter Weibull probability distribution model and Weibull regression analysis and revealed that the Weibull modulus had a value greater than 1 in all groups, indicating an increasing failure rate with time for Ecoflex 30 and 50 meniscus implants. Results from quantitative cell proliferative assay exhibit statistically insignificant differences for all samples, pointing to the low cytotoxicity and excellent biocompatibility of printed silicone.",

    "abstract": "Underperformed interfacial bond and anisotropic properties are often observed in three-dimensional-printed concrete, where the printing pattern is unidirectional. Such issues could be potentially alleviated by replicating microstructures of natural materials or applying different architectures, where printed layers are arranged into unique and unconventional patterns. Furthermore, the quest to develop printing methods for highly complex or self-support concrete architecture could benefit from these nature-inspired patterns. In this work, the influences of different architectural arrangements of layers on mechanical properties of hardened concrete on compressive and flexural strengths are investigated. Specifically, unidirectional (0°), cross-ply (0°/90°), quasi-isotropic (0°/ ± 45°/90°), and helicoidal patterns (with pitch angles of 10°, 20°, and 30°) are used to create unidirectional, bidirectional, and multidirectional layers in printed objects without and with 0.75% by volume of 6 mm-long steel fibers. The experimental results demonstrate considerable improvements in the flexural strengths of nontraditional specimens without steel fibers over the unidirectional control with a few exceptions. Among investigated patterns, the quasi-isotropic demonstrates significant influences in both compressive and flexural responses of printed concrete samples without steel fibers. The addition of steel fibers leads to noticeable improvement on both compressive and flexural strengths of samples in any pattern compared with their counterparts without fibers. Besides, the inclusion of steel fibers into unconventional layups (cross-ply, quasi-isotropic, and helicoidal patterns) leads to the alleviation of directional dependence of mechanical properties, which is a limitation of the unidirectional samples with fibers. Of all helicoidal patterns, the one with a 10°-angle layup is shown to be more beneficial to the flexural strength enhancement and damage resistance in bending. X-ray microcomputed tomography measurements are performed to visualize the direction and distribution of fibers.",

    "abstract": "Cellular structures including three-dimensional lattices and two-dimensional honeycombs have significant benefits in achieving optimal mechanical performance with light weighting. Recently developed design techniques integrated with additive manufacturing (AM) technologies have enhanced the possibility of fabricating intricate geometries such as honeycomb structures. Generally, failure initiates from the sharp edges in honeycomb structures, which leads to a reduction in stiffness and energy absorption performance. By material quantity, these hinges account for a large amount of material in cells. Therefore, redesigning of honeycomb structures is needed, which can improve aforementioned characteristics. However, this increases the design complexity of honeycombs, such that novel manufacturing techniques such as AM has to be employed. This research attempts to investigate the optimal material distribution of three different topologies of honeycomb structures (hexagonal, triangular, and square) with nine different design configurations. To achieve this, higher amount of material was distributed at nodes in the form of fillets while keeping overall weight of the structure constant. Furthermore, these design configurations were analyzed in terms of stiffness, energy absorption, and the failure behavior by performing finite element analysis and experimental tests on the samples manufactured using Multijet fusion AM technology. It was found that adding material to the edges can improve the mechanical properties of honeycombs such as stiffness and energy absorption efficiency. Furthermore, the failure mechanism is changed due to redistribution of material in the structure. The design configurations without fillets suffer from brittle failure at the start of the plastic deformation, whereas the configurations with increased material proportion at the nodes have larger plastic deformation zones, which improves the energy absorption efficiency.",

However, despite widespread application and evident advantages over traditional manufacturing techniques, AM still suffers from redundant support material usage when printing parts with overhanging features. In this article, a support generation method through print path planning is proposed for the first time, with the aim of reducing support material consumption in AM of parts with flat features. Print path can significantly influence the support usage when considering the longest printable bridge length. Two parts are printed by our new method with much less support consumption than general line and grid support generation methods. The results show the effectiveness of this new support generation method in terms of both reducing the support consumption and finish surface deterioration, enabling AM to be a more environmental friendly and sustainable manufacturing technique.",

Key results indicate that (1) a reduction in holding cost has more impact on reducing the stock-out probability when the average demand rate for spare parts is low and (2) lead time reduction may negatively affect the stock-out probability. The framework is applied to a published case study to underscore the impacts of AM implementation on inventory strategies. Potential applications and current shortcomings are also discussed.",

These composites were then 3D printed using a conventional, commercially available 3D printer. Although many MOFs suffer from instability in humid environments, each of the MOFs in our study maintains its structure within the ABS composite even on soaking in water. Moreover, the MOFs maintain their nitrogen adsorption capacities within the composites. The retention of MOF gas adsorption properties within the composite is promising in that these materials can be optimized (MOF, polymer, and 3D-printed geometry) for a number of applications, including gas storage, filtering, sensing, and catalysis.",

    "abstract": "Bone regeneration is naturally based on bone forming cells, osteoinduction by diverse growth factors, and osteoconduction. The latter one used as term in this study is the ingrowth of bone in 3D structures, which leads to an optimal case in creeping substitution of the scaffold by newly formed bone. Autologous bone is still the gold standard for bone substitutes. In most cases, newly developed bone substitutes consist of calcium phosphate, since hydroxyapatite is the main component of bone and mimics cancellous bone in microstructure. In this study, we wanted to elucidate the optimal microarchitecture for osteoconduction and determine compression strength and Young's Modulus of the selected architectures. Selective laser melting of titanium was used as tool to generate diverse architectures in a repetitive and precise way. To link 3D scaffold architecture to biological readouts, bone ingrowth, bone to implant contact, and defect bridging of noncritical-sized defects in the calvarial bone of rabbits were determined. In this series, 5 different microarchitectures were tested with pore sizes ranging from 700 to 1300 μm and constrictions between 290 and 700 μm. To our surprise, all microstructures showed the same biological response of excellent osteoconduction. However, the mechanical yield strength of these structures differed by the factor of three and reached up to three times the strength of cancellous bone at a porosity of 72.3–88.4%. These results suggest that the microarchitecture of bone substitutes can be optimized toward mechanical strength in a wide range of constrictions and pore sizes without having a negative influence on osteoconduction.",

The technology allows control over grain size, packing, mineralogy, cementing type and content, bedding orientation, and discontinuities. This article explored how curing temperature affects the strength of sand and furfuryl alcohol resin-based specimens. When cured at optimal oven temperature of 80°C, specimens reach unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of 19.0 MPa with only 1.1 MPa in standard deviation. Additionally, this article determines a minimal number of UCS test repetitions required to reach a desired degree of confidence in the strength results.

X-ray micro-computed tomography (microCT or CT) can be used for defect/porosity analysis as well as for comparing the part surface with its computer-aided design (CAD) file. In both cases, the limited use of CT is partly due to the variation in scan types and the quality of scans that can occur. We present a simple method demonstrating the use of a light metal casting as a reference porosity sample, to confirm good CT image quality and to quantify minimum detectable pore size for the selected CT scan settings. This makes a good comparison for additive manufactured parts, since castings generally contain more porosity. A full part-to-CAD comparison shows how the part is compared with its CAD file, as a second-quality control. The accuracy of the CAD variance is given by the minimum detectable pore size. Finally, the part is sectioned and scanned at two higher resolution settings showing small porosity (10–50 μm diameter) present but well distributed, as expected.",

Nonetheless, processes for the fabrication of complex geometry and custom objects with glass remain elusive. We present G3DP2—a second iteration of the novel additive manufacturing (AM) technology for transparent glass products developed by The Mediated Matter Group at MIT. One of the oldest production materials, glass involves complex material chemistry and requires extreme working temperatures underlying the persistent challenges associated with its design and production. AM with molten glass presents a potential path toward production of highly complex geometry and custom-designed objects while retaining the optical transparency and chemical stability available through traditional manufacturing processes. G3DP2 is a new AM platform for molten glass that combines digitally integrated three-zone thermal control system with four-axis motion control system, introducing industrial-scale production capabilities with enhanced production rate and reliability while ensuring product accuracy and repeatability, all previously unattainable for glass. A series of material characterizations were conducted to evaluate the mechanical properties of the 3D-printed glass products produced by G3DP2. A set of 3-m-tall glass columns was designed, engineered, and digitally fabricated for Milan Design Week 2017, highlighting the geometric complexity, accuracy, strength, and transparency of 3D-printed glass at an architectural scale for the first time and a critical step in utilizing the true structural capacity of the material. Together, the installation and the G3DP2 platform serve as a foundation for future work and suggest exciting possibilities associated with the digital fabrication of glass as well as potential applications in product and architectural design.",

A search of 13 databases was performed to identify studies of 3D-printed medical devices, detailing fabrication technology and materials employed, clinical application, and clinical outcome. One hundred and ten papers describing one hundred and forty medical devices were identified and analyzed. A considerable increase was identified in the use of 3D printing to produce medical devices directly for clinical use in the past 3 years.

The prevailing material/3D-printing technology used were titanium alloy/electron beam melting for implants, and polyamide/selective laser sintering or polylactic acid/fused deposition modeling for surgical guides and instruments. A detailed analysis across medical applications by technology and materials is provided, as well as a commentary regarding regulatory aspects.

    "abstract": "The fabrication of bioinspired structures has recently gained an increasing popularity: mimicking the way in which nature develops structures is a vital prerequisite in soft robotics to achieve multiple benefits. Stiff structures connected by soft joints (recalling, for instance, human bones connected by cartilage) are highly appealing: several prototypes have been manufactured and tested, demonstrating their full potential. In the present research, the material extrusion (MEX) additive manufacturing technology has been used to manufacture stiff-soft bioinspired structures activated by shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators. First, three commercially available stiff composite plastic materials were investigated and linked to different 3D printing infills. Surprisingly, we found that the \"gyroid\" infill was correlated to the mechanical properties, demonstrating that it produces better results in terms of Young's modulus and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) than the widely studied \"lines\" infill. The primary focus of the research is an experimental study aimed at improving the adhesion at the interface between stiff and soft materials using an inexpensive method (i.e., MEX). Three different variables that have significant effects on the interface bonding were studied: (1) the interface geometry between stiff and soft parts, (2) the mesh overlapping process parameter, and (3) the annealing post-treatment. By optimizing the three variables, a Young's modulus of 48.8 MPa and a UTS of 3.8 MPa were achieved, when nylon+glass fiber (a stiff material) and thermoplastic polyurethane (a soft material) were 3D printed together. In particular, the 3.8 MPa UTS is 48% higher than the highest adhesion between the soft and stiff material (thermoplastic polyurethane [TPU] and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) reported in literature. Finally, taking advantage of the improved stiff-soft adhesion, a bioinspired robotic finger has been fabricated and tested using an SMA actuator, showing an enormous potential for the proposed additive manufacturing approach in realizing bioinspired systems.",

    "abstract": "For wider adoption of the material extrusion (MatEx)-based additive manufacturing (AM) process, it is important to understand the systems for an improved production rate of the machine. This AM process is the most adaptable and popular due to its wide availability, scalability, compatibility with a broad range of thermoplastic materials, and decreasing cost of personal MatEx-based systems. The performance limits are being explored by many researchers, but none have tried to find the efficacy of different kinematic configurations. Kinematic configurations can significantly alter the efficiency of the machines. Most machines are operating on Cartesian positioning systems nowadays. Delta and polar positioning systems are not yet been extensively explored. In this study, Cartesian, delta, and polar systems of MatEx 3D printers are analyzed and compared based on physical inspection, print head dynamics and printed parts surface finish, dimensional accuracy, and build time. Based on the comparative study, the results show that the delta system-based 3D printer gives better surface finish and dimensional accuracy than polar and Cartesian system-based 3D printers. The analysis of build time with respect to the different infill densities and different printing speeds shows that the polar system-based 3D printers performed faster than the other two positing systems.",

The numerical method can give relatively accurate results but is time-consuming and, therefore, unsuitable for in-process prediction. Owing to its remarkable capabilities, machine learning methods have been applied to predict melt pool size and temperature distribution. However, the success of traditional data-driven machine learning methods is highly dependent on the amount and quality of the training data, which is not always convenient to access. This article proposes a physics-informed machine learning (PIML) method, which integrates data and physics laws in the training parts, overcoming the problems of low speed and data availability. An artificial neural network constrained by the heat transfer equation and a small amount of labeled data is developed to predict the melt pool size and temperature distribution. Besides, the locally adaptive activation function is utilized to improve the prediction performance. The result shows that the developed PIML model can accurately predict the temperature and melt pool dimension under different scanning speeds with a small amount of labeled data, which shows significant potential in practical application.",

The mechanical characteristics of functionally graded BCC lattice structures were explored, resulting in enhanced mechanical features compared with uniform-graded BCC lattice structures. Due to the gradient lattice structure, the average bending load significantly increased to 62.5%. It was found that the BCC lattice structure only exhibits a dual failure model comprising buckling and fracture, compared with other lattice structures that often offer sole buckling or fracture failure. The buckling of the struts starts from the bottom and ends with a fracture. BCC lattice sandwiches provide an opportunity to balance strength and weight ratio effectively. The experimental findings showed close agreement with finite element results. Numerical modeling illustrates the stress–strain and force–deformation curves, and the failure mechanism is the strut buckling triggered from the plastic hinges with high-stress levels.",

It is found that the LSF metallic parts, especially LSF titanium alloy parts, present outstanding mechanical properties usually in the class of those of wrought parts. LSF parts generally exhibit typical columnar dendrites/grains epitaxially growing through several deposition layers with the growth direction along laser deposition direction, which leads to a larger grain size in LSF parts. However, the microstructure features inside the grain are usually finer compared with a forging part due to the rapid solidification and cooling during LSF, and even composition distribution without macrosegregation is obtained. These microstructural characteristics are responsible for the excellent mechanical properties. In recent years, direct fabrication, hybrid manufacturing, and high-performance repairing, which are based on the LSF route, have been applied widely in aviation, aerospace, and the medical field.",

AM is fundamentally different because it creates product by successive deposits of material instead of using removal or forming processes. Because of this difference, the cost and operational characteristics are distinct from traditional manufacturing. In this study, we place AM in an end-to-end supply chain setting. We propose a strategic optimization model that helps a manufacturer decide whether AM is a better option for their supply chain than traditional manufacturing. We run a scenario regimen over a wide variety of stochastic elements to determine the most important factors for AM adoption. We observe that, in line with others' observations, the magnitude of demand is the most critical factor for the decision of which method to adopt. We argue that a decrease in the cost of materials has the most potential to increase AM adoption. We place AM in an end-to-end supply chain context and propose a stochastic optimization model to help a manufacturer decide when AM is best for them. Finally, we characterize the most important factors for AM adoption on a wider scale and estimate the magnitude of that impact.",

The focus is on producing passive elastomeric components of DEA and the dimensional changes that occur after printing is complete. A four-axis printing system is described, capable of spray depositing multilayer tubular silicone membranes onto an air-permeable mandrel. Mechanical strain was imparted in the membranes by means of inflation. A laser measurement system was constructed to act as a 3D scanner, which measured the shape of the inflated “balloon.” The surface shape was reconstructed in software using the parametric modeling tool Grasshopper. Seamless auxetic tessellations were calculated across the entire surface, and then converted to CNC GCode. These toolpaths were then physically extruded over the surface of the balloon, stacked five layers high. When the extruded silicone structure was completely cured, the pneumatic strain was released, allowing the structure to collapse evenly. The compression in the printed structure was balanced by the tension in the stretched membranes, thus producing a minimum energy structure.",

One additive manufacturing technology used to design and fabricate such structures is melt electrowriting (MEW), a process which needs to be scaled in production to effectively translate to industrial applications. In this study, a scale-up printer, designed with eight simultaneously extruding heads, is constructed and validated. Importantly, identical structures could be fabricated using parameters developed from a single-head system, therefore establishing a MEW printer ecosystem that allows for direct upscaling from laboratory research. The successful transfer to vertically mounted collectors produced homogeneous reproducible scaffolds with identical morphologies and fiber diameters. These proof-of-concept experiments also show that MEW is capable of large-scale fabrication, successfully demonstrated by manufacturing 780 × 780-mm sheets of scaffolds/lattices. This study demonstrates that upscaling MEW can be realized by multiplying the number of print heads, while vertical mounting of the collector significantly reduces the MEW footprint. Additionally, economic aspects were considered during the development and costly components, such as the x, y, and z linear axes, were minimized. Herein, a systems engineering approach for the development of a high-throughput MEW technology platform is presented for the first time.",

Methods for optimizing the extrusion process to eliminate the void density during large-scale FPM processes were studied.

    "abstract": "Ensuring additive manufactured metal components are free of major defects is crucial to the application of this new technology in medical and aerospace industries. One source of defects in such parts is lack of fusion in individual locations or specific layers. Such lack of melting or fusion could be the result of a nonflat powder bed due to an imperfect recoating blade or loose support structures causing recoating problems. Another possible source is laser power fluctuations or beam size fluctuations, or even ambient humidity or temperature changes, among others. The aims of this article are to investigate lack of fusion with planned induced defects (cavities) with different three-dimensional (3D) geometries and analyze these using nondestructive 3D X-ray tomography. It is found that some fusion occurs in induced defect layers and lines perpendicular to the build direction (XY) up to 180 μm in height. This means fusion occurs through fused layers above cavities, minimizing defect formation in the plane of the build platform. In contrast, in the case of vertical cavities (cavity walls) parallel to the build direction, much larger defects are observed compared to the above case. This result may point to the build direction (vertical) being more favorable for porosity formation under nonideal conditions (i.e., a preferred directionality). An example of unexpected porosity trail formation in the build direction is also reported from such nonideal conditions for a real part in contrast to a designed cavity.",

To date, virtually all 3D-printable medical data sets are created using traditional image thresholding, subsequent isosurface extraction, and the generation of .stl surface mesh file formats. These existing methods, however, are highly prone to segmentation artifacts that either over- or underexaggerate the features of interest, thus resulting in anatomically inaccurate 3D prints. In addition, they often omit finer detailed structures and require time- and labor-intensive processes to visually verify their accuracy. To circumvent these problems, we present a bitmap-based multimaterial 3D printing workflow for the rapid and highly accurate generation of physical models directly from volumetric data stacks. This workflow employs a thresholding-free approach that bypasses both isosurface creation and traditional mesh slicing algorithms, hence significantly improving speed and accuracy of model creation. In addition, using preprocessed binary bitmap slices as input to multimaterial 3D printers allows for the physical rendering of functional gradients native to volumetric data sets, such as stiffness and opacity, opening the door for the production of biomechanically accurate models.",

In contrast to existing approaches, this framework emphasizes the ability to integrate multiple geometry-based data sources to achieve high levels of control for applications in a wide variety of design scenarios. As a proof of concept, we present a case study for DdMM using functional advection, and we demonstrate how multiple data sources used by the slicing framework are implemented to control material property distributions.",

    "abstract": "Owing to the high reactivity of titanium with oxygen at high temperatures, oxidation is often observed during wire and arc additive manufacture (WAAM) of Ti-6Al-4V. As a sign of oxidation, discoloration of titanium components built by WAAM is usually observed, due to the formation of a thin oxide scale on the surface. This generally constitutes a major concern from the end user. Together with the oxide scale, oxidation also produces the formation of a brittle oxygen-enriched layer near the surface (Alpha Case) and it can be detrimental in terms of mechanical properties. Hence, it is of major interest to investigate the influence of surface oxidation on the bulk material property of WAAM of Ti-6Al-4V and understand the oxidation process during WAAM deposition. In this work, oxidation of titanium during WAAM was investigated to determine the mechanisms and main process parameters controlling this phenomenon. To address this, plasma-transferred arc and wire deposition samples were manufactured by changing either deposition parameters or oxygen levels in the fusion atmosphere. Subsequently, samples were characterized by means of visual inspection, optical microscope, scanning electron microscope, and tensile mechanical testing. For any containing level of oxygen in the shielding environment, it was found that if temperatures are high enough and exposure times long, oxidation of titanium is observed. In addition, it was possible to determine that oxidation is more significant in the region of the first deposited layers. The maximum depth of Alpha Case was found to be 200 μm for the samples built with higher current (220 A) and wider oscillation width. Tensile testing revealed that increasing 40 times the oxygen levels in the shielding environment does not affect the tensile strength significantly.",

The printouts, if damaged or after usage, were fully depolymerized in an organic solvent, and they were partially cured into a new ink for the next round of 3D printing. This work presents fundamental studies to understand the influences of ink composition and rheological properties on the printability, recyclability, and thermomechanical properties of printed CAN components. A polyimine-based CAN is used as the material platform for the direct-ink-writing (DIW) 3D printing, which exhibits lower processing temperature and catalyst-free features. This study reveals that the incorporation of nano-clay maintains the recyclability, malleability, and thermomechanical properties of polyimines, and it dramatically improves the shear modulus and yielding stress of inks for the 3D printing of complex structures with dangling features. The developed inks are shown to be recycled five times and still retain an excellent printability. The 3D-printed polymer structures usually exhibit notable anisotropic mechanical properties due to their weak interfaces. However, the DIW printing of CANs is shown to create structures with comparable properties in different printing directions because of the strong interfaces connected by covalent bonds. It, thus, possesses the great potential to tackle this long-standing challenge in the 3D printing field.",

    "abstract": "Despite the dynamic development of additive manufacturing technologies, including selective laser sintering (SLS), there is still limited information on the impact of key factors in printing strategy, on the properties of three-dimensional (3D) printed parts. Such factors, such as the orientation of printed layers toward the powder bed or elements target dimensions, seem to be particularly important, from both a mechanical and a structural point of view. Besides, the scientific articles mainly focus on the analysis of one type of loading condition in the samples, that is, the uniaxial tensile test, which were printed on industrial SLS printers. This is a considerable limitation because very often not only tensile forces but also compressive forces act on the structural elements. Therefore, this study aimed at evaluating the influence of desktop SLS printed parts' orientation and diameter on their structural and mechanical parameters. The mechanical properties of samples printed from PA12 powder on the desktop SLS 3D printer were tested in uniaxial tensile and compression tests, as well as structural properties were investigated. For the purposes of this article, 5 angular orientations of the samples in relation to the powder bed and three diameters of cylindrical samples were analyzed. The research has shown that in the case of samples subjected to tensile load, the printing strategy is important, and the best mechanical parameters are obtained for parts printed at an angle of 0°, that is, in the powder bed's plane. The highest values of mechanical parameters were obtained for a part oriented at an angle of 0°. In the case of the uniaxial compression test and structural parameters, the parts orientation turned out to be an insignificant factor affecting the tested parameters. However, the diameter of printed elements was proven to have a significant influence; the best geometric and dimensional representation was observed for parts biggest in size.",

The mechanical properties of three-dimensionally (3D) printed PPS samples are affected by the mass of the melt extruded filament and the printing pattern in the inner layer. The present study demonstrates the effects of the melt extrusion and filament alignment parameters on tensile, bending, and impact strengths of 3D printed PPS samples. The results indicate that by increasing the melt extrusion parameters, the tensile and bending strengths of 3D printed PPS samples can be improved and internal voids between adjacent filaments can be eliminated. However, the impact strength was restricted by excess melt extrusion. By measuring the strength of 3D printed PPS samples with different filament alignment, we observed that the tensile and bending strengths increase with decreasing angle between the filament and load direction. Moreover, the local tensile strain between adjacent filaments and slippage of the microstructure cell formed by aligning the filament are thought to absorb the impact energy. This study provides a useful guide for selection of appropriate printing parameters to realize a diverse range of mechanical properties for 3D printed PPS samples.",

    "abstract": "Defect detection in additive manufacturing (AM) is of paramount importance to improve the reliability of products. Nondestructive testing is not yet widely used for defect detection. The main challenges are a lack of standards and methods, the types and location of defects, and the complex geometry of many parts. During selective laser melting (SLM), several types of defects can occur such as porosity, cracking, and lack of fusion. In this study, several nondestructive tests were conducted in a highly complex shaped part in AISI 316L stainless steel with real defects manufactured by SLM. Two additional artificial defects (one horizontal and one flat bottom hole) were produced and the defect detectability was evaluated. The techniques used were as follows: dye penetrant, infrared thermography, immersion ultrasonic, eddy current, and X-ray microcomputed tomography to assess different types of defects in the as-built part. We conclude that no single technique can detect every type of defect, although multiple techniques provide complementary and redundant information to critically evaluate the integrity of the parts. This approach is fundamental for improving the reliability of defect detection, which will help expand the potential for using AM to produce parts for critical structural applications.",

The aim of this study was to compare the plantar pressure distribution while walking in the same footwear in three different situations: with an original footwear insole, with an ethylene-vinyl acetate customized insole, and with a 3D printed anatomical insole to find out the optimal insoles for people with a normal, flat, and high arched foot according to the plantar pressure relief. Fifty-one adults were grouped into three groups (normal foot, flat foot, and high arched foot geometry). The feet of the randomly selected subjects from each group were scanned, and the insoles were designed on the basis of the foot model. These models were then used for the 3D printing. The plantar pressure distribution was observed when walking in all three different insole types for each of the three subjects with the different foot types. The peak pressure values in the forefoot, midfoot, and rearfoot and contact area were compared. The results of the study show that customized insoles influence the plantar pressure distribution mainly in people with a flat foot or with a high arched foot deformity. This influence is dependent on the type of the customized insoles, mainly in people with a high arched foot. People with a flat foot deformity have a similar plantar pressure relief in the thermoplastic insoles as those in the 3D printed insoles, and both these customized insoles can be used as a supplementary therapeutic instrument. Our study showed that the biggest attention, with regards to customizing insoles, is required by people with a high arched foot deformity, and we recommend that these people use fully customized insoles which can be guaranteed with 3D printing techniques.",

However, at least in the case of concrete, it encounters significant challenges in terms of material design, since high paste volumes and Portland cement contents are normally used due to process requirements. In this article, the application to layered extrusion of a recently developed low clinker cement containing 50% Portland cement and 50% supplementary cementitious materials, such as limestone, burnt oil shale, and fly ash, is presented. It is found that an accelerator paste composed by Calcium Aluminate Cement (CAC) and anhydrite provides the required hydration and structural build-up for 3D printing, while not compromising the early and long-term compressive strength. Such a low clinker mortar can be successfully retarded, processed, pumped, and extruded just after mixing it in line with the accelerator paste. This accelerated mortar formulation contains only 303 kg/m3 of Portland cement, which is roughly half the amount used in current accelerated formulations used for digital fabrication with concrete.",

Four-dimensional (4D) printing is a valuable method for multiscale fabrication and physical programming of such structures. However, material limitations in terms of printability, responsiveness, and mechanical properties are major bottlenecks in achieving reliable and repeatable humidity-responsive actuation. We propose a codesign method for 4D printing hygromorphic structures through fused filament fabrication, incorporating parallel development of (1) biobased cellulose-filled filaments with varying stiffness and hygroresponsiveness, and (2) designed mesoscale structuring in printed elements. We first describe the design of a pallet of filaments produced by compounding cellulose powder in mass ratios of 0-30% within two matrix polymers with high and low stiffness. We then present the design, fabrication, and testing of a series of 4D-printed prototypes tuned to change shape, that is, open and close, in response to relative humidity (RH). The structures can fully transform in conditions of 35-90% RH, which corresponds to naturally occurring shifts in RH in daily and seasonal weather cycles. Furthermore, their motion is fast (within the range of minutes), fully reversible, and repeatable in numerous cycles. These results open new opportunities for the utilization of 4D printing and natural resources for the development of functional humidity-responsive smart structures.",

In this study, we investigate the energy absorption for honeycombs with square and hexagonal unit cells constructed from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). Honeycombs were fabricated and tested for out-of-plane and in-plane compression using ABS, TPU, and a combination of ABS with a central TPU band of tunable height. Out-of-plane energy absorption for square honeycombs increased from 2.2 kN·mm for TPU samples to 11.5 kN·mm for ABS samples and energy absorption of hexagonal honeycombs increased from 2.9 to 15.1 kN·mm as proportions of TPU/ABS were altered. In-plane loading demonstrated a sequential collapse of unit cell rows in square honeycombs with energy absorption of 0.1 to 2.6 kN·mm and a gradual failure of hexagonal honeycombs with energy absorption of 0.6 to 2.0 kN·mm. These results demonstrate how multimaterial combinations affect honeycomb compressive response by highlighting their benefits for controlled energy absorption and deformation for tunable performance in diverse engineering applications.",

Among various biomaterials, hydrogels have been increasingly used in developing bioinks suitable for 3D bioprinting for diverse human body tissues and organs. In particular, hydrogel blends combining gelatin and gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA; \"GG hydrogels\") receive significant attention for 3D bioprinting owing to their many advantages, such as excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, intrinsic bioactive groups, and polymer networks that combine the thermoresponsive gelation feature of gelatin and chemically crosslinkable attribute of GelMA. However, GG hydrogels have poor electroactive properties, which hinder their applications in neural tissue engineering where electrical conductivity is required. To overcome this problem, in this study, a small amount of highly electroactive graphene oxide (GO) was added in GG hydrogels to generate electroactive hydrogels for 3D bioprinting in neural tissue engineering. The incorporation of GO nanoparticles slightly improved mechanical properties and significantly increased electrical conductivity of GG hydrogels. All GO/GG composite hydrogels exhibited shear thinning behavior and sufficient viscosity and hence could be 3D printed into 3D porous scaffolds with good shape fidelity. Furthermore, bioinks combining rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (rBMSCs) with GO/GG composite hydrogels could be 3D bioprinted into GO/GG constructs with high cell viability. GO nanoparticles in the constructs provided ultraviolet (UV) shading effect and facilitated cell survival during UV exposure after bioprinting. The GO/GG composite hydrogels appear promising for 3D bioprinting applications in repairing damaged neural tissues.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a methodology to develop printability maps for the laser powder bed fusion of AISI 316L stainless steel. Regions in the process space associated with different defect types, including lack of fusion, balling, and keyhole formation, have been considered as a melt pool geometry function, determined using a finite element method model containing temperature-dependent thermophysical properties. Experiments were performed to validate the printability maps, showing a reliable correlation between experiments and simulations. The validated simulation model was then applied to collect the data by varying laser scanning speed, laser power, powder layer thickness, and powder bed preheating temperature. Following this, the collected data were used to train and test the adaptive neuro-fuzzy interference system (ANFIS)-based machine learning model. The validated ANFIS model was used to develop printability maps by correlating the melt pool characteristics to the defect types. The smart printability maps produced by the proposed methodology can be used to identify the processing window to attain defects-free components, thus attaining dense parts.",

For bone regeneration, researchers are focusing on the use of polymeric and polymer/ceramic scaffolds seeded with osteoblasts or mesenchymal stem cells. However, high-performance scaffolds in terms of mechanical, cell stimulation, and biological performance are still required. This article investigates the use of an extrusion additive manufacturing system to produce poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) and PCL/graphene nanosheet scaffolds for bone applications. Scaffolds with regular and reproducible architecture and uniform dispersion of graphene were produced and coated with P1-latex protein extracted from the Hevea brasiliensis rubber tree. Results show that the obtained scaffolds cultivated with human adipose-derived stem cells present no toxicity effects. The presence of graphene nanosheet and P1-latex protein in the scaffolds increased cell proliferation compared with PCL scaffolds. Moreover, the presence of P1-latex protein promotes earlier osteogenic differentiation, suggesting that PCL/graphene/P1-latex protein scaffolds are suitable for bone regeneration applications.",

The microarchitecture, that is, design with submillimeter features, of additively manufactured scaffolds is in many cases a lattice structure. This study aimed to apply SLM that allows a high degree of microarchitectural freedom to generate lattice structures and to determine the optimal distance between rods and the optimal diameter of rods for osteoconduction (bone ingrowth into scaffolds) and bone regeneration. For the biological readout, diverse SLM-fabricated titanium implants were placed in the calvarium of rabbits and new bone formation and defect bridging were determined after 4 weeks of healing. The results from the middle section of the defects show that with a lattice microarchitecture, the optimal distance between titanium rods is around 0.8 mm and the optimal rod dimension is between 0.3 and 0.4 mm to optimize defect bridging and bone regeneration.",

Our framework optimizes the cross-sectional properties of a rod structure, in particular the Young's modulus, such that under given loading conditions it can obtain one or more target shapes resulting from geometrically nonlinear deformation, from which the structure can then actively deform back to the original shape due to the SME. Our approach includes a novel algorithm to generate physical realizations from the computational design model, which allows their direct fabrication via printing of shape memory composites with voxel-level compositional control with a multi-material 3D printer. Our design and manufacture digital toolchain allows the continuous variation of multiple active materials as a route to optimize mechanical as well as active behavior of a structure, without changing the original shape of the 3D rod structure, which is not possible with a single material.

    "abstract": "Acetabular fractures are complex and difficult to classify. Although the Judet–Letournel classification is designed to increase the understanding of acetabular fractures, it remains prone to error when using conventional medical imaging. We hypothesize that three-dimensional (3D) printing, as a new diagnostic imaging tool, will lead to an increased understanding and knowledge of acetabular fractures and an optimal surgical approach. Digital data (DICOM) of 20 acetabular fractures were converted into 3D files [standard tessellation language (STL) data]. These STL files were used to prepare 3D prints of life-size hemipelvic models with acetabular fractures. Seven senior trauma surgeons specializing in pelvic and acetabular surgery, 5 young fellowship-trained trauma surgeons, 5 senior surgical residents, 5 junior surgical residents, and 5 interns classified 20 acetabular cases using X-ray/two-dimensional (2D) computed tomography (CT), 3D reconstructions, and 3D printed models according to the Judet–Letournel classification. Furthermore, all junior and senior surgeons were instructed to evaluate their surgical approach and the positioning of the patient during operation. Time to classify each case was recorded. Calculations were done using Fleiss' κ statistics. Only slight and fair interobserver agreements for senior surgeons (κ = 0.33) and interns (κ = 0.16) were found when using X-ray/2D CT. However, 3D printed models showed moderate and substantial interobserver agreements for senior surgeons (κ = 0.59), junior surgeons (κ = 0.56), senior surgical residents (κ = 0.66), junior surgical residents (κ = 0.51), and interns (κ = 0.61). Compared with X-ray/2D CT, the interobserver agreement regarding the surgical approach for junior surgeons using 3D printed models increased by κ = 0.04 and κ = 0.23, respectively. Except for the interns, a significant time difference for classification was found between X-ray/2D CT and 3D CT and 3D printed models for junior and senior surgical residents and junior and senior surgeons (p < 0.001). 3D printing is of added value in the understanding, classification, and surgical evaluation of acetabular fractures. We recommend the implementation of 3D printed models in trauma surgery training.",

Additive manufacturing provides a cost-effective means to create patient-specific implants and allows for customized textures for integration with bone and other tissues. Our objective was to compare the osseointegration strength of two primary additive manufacturing methods of producing textured implants: electron beam melting (EBM) (mean Ra = 23 μm) and direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) (mean Ra = 10 μm). Due to spatial resolution, DMLS can produce surfaces with a roughness comparable to EBM. Two cohorts of Sprague-Dawley rats received bilateral, titanium implants in their distal femurs and were followed for 4 weeks. The first-cohort animals received EBM implants transcortically in one femur and a DMLS implant in the contralateral femur. The second cohort received DMLS implants (either fine textured or coarse textured to mimic EBM) in the intramedullary canal of each femur. Osseointegration was evaluated through mechanical testing and micro-computed tomography (bone volume fraction [BV/TV] and bone-implant contact [BIC]). The fixation strength of coarse textured implants provided superior interlocking relative to fine textured implants without affecting BV/TV or BIC in both cohorts. Coarse EBM implants in a transcortical model demonstrated an 85% increase in removal torque relative to the fine DMLS textured implants. The thrust load in the intramedullary model saw a 35% increase from fine to coarse DMLS implants.",

These data are used to determine time and temperature boundary conditions for amount of curing during extrusion and layering of the print. From the time of mixing, rheological data show how the elastic modulus (G′) and yield stress (σy) grow as the number of crosslinks increases. The kinetics data show changes in the rate of curing of the silicone and predict final cure time. Time boundaries for stages of transient curing are reported from heat flow, yield stress, and G′ at the printer operating temperature. These times are used to prevent clogging of the mixing nozzle and ensure layering of unsupported elastomeric silicone. Several models are 3D printed to show the successes and drawbacks of the method within equipment limitations. This framework can be applied to help bound the printable region of other reactive thermoset materials in mixed extrusion systems. By printing without support, this method can produce overhanging and enclosed hollow structures that require minimal postprocessing.",

    "abstract": "Fused deposition modeling (FDM) printers are some of the most common additive manufacturing (AM) systems in use today. One of their most significant drawbacks compared with alternative AM techniques is that they are unable to easily integrate multiple materials into a single process to produce gradient parts, which have different mechanical properties within a single printed object. Much of this limitation comes from the need to have single filaments as inputs to a printed part, and weak bonding between thermoplastics if they are not chemically miscible. In this work, a simple method to actively enhance the bonding strength between chemically immiscible thermoplastics using a static intermixer inserted into the nozzle of a multi-input FDM system has been demonstrated. This system was successfully used to enhance adhesion between rigid and soft, stretchable polymers, which have nearly three orders of magnitude of difference in elastic moduli. The replaceable intermixer within the print head permits direct comparison of side-by-side or intermixed coextrusion processes. The bond strength between adjacent deposited fibers in intermixed printing was found to be at least 12 times higher than that of the fibers in side-by-side printing. As a proof-of-concept, tendon-driven soft robotic fingers with functionally gradient materials produced from mechanically interlocked dissimilar polymers have been printed and characterized. The fingers printed with intermixed coextrusion of hard and soft polymers do not show any noticeable interface failure after 10,000 cycles of operation, whereas other samples printed with side-by-side coextrusion experienced layer delamination before 10,000 cycles. By using a two-tendon system, these fingers have an agonist–antagonist balanced structure to control its stiffness during operation. The soft robotic gripper fabricated from these printed fingers shows its capability to grasp irregular objects with sizes larger than the gripper holder by actuating in both inward and outward directions.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate cellular response to three-dimensional (3D) porous Ti-6Al-4V constructs fabricated by additive manufacturing using laser sintering with low porosity (LP), medium porosity (MP), and high porosity (HP) with low resolution (LR) and high resolution (HR) based on a computed tomography scan of human trabecular bone. After surface processing, construct porosity ranged from 41.0% to 76.1%, but all possessed micro-/nanoscale surface roughness and similar surface chemistry containing mostly Ti, O, and C. Biological responses (osteoblast differentiation, maturation, and local factor production) by MG63 osteoblast-like cells and normal human osteoblasts favored 3D than two-dimensional (2D) solid constructs. First, MG63 cells were used to assess differences in cell response to 2D compared to LR and HR porous 3D constructs. MG63 cells were sensitive to porosity resolution and exhibited increased osteocalcin (OCN), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), osteoprotegerin (OPG), and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) on HR 3D constructs than on 2D and LR 3D constructs. MG63 cells also exhibited porosity-dependent responses on HR constructs, with up to a 6.9-fold increase in factor production on LP-HR and MP-HR constructs than on HP-HR constructs. NHOsts were then used to validate biological response on HR constructs. NHOsts exhibited decreased DNA content and alkaline phosphatase activity and up to a 2.9-fold increase in OCN, OPG, VEGF, BMP2, and BMP4 on 3D HR constructs than on 2D controls. These results indicate that osteoblasts prefer a 3D architecture than a 2D surface and that osteoblasts are sensitive to the resolution of trabecular detail and porosity parameters of laser-sintered 3D Ti-6Al-4V constructs.",

    "abstract": "This article presents the effect analysis of the printing time sequences on the mechanical properties in correlation with the crystallization kinetics and rheological behavior. For this purpose, two printing order of 3D printed samples (printed simultaneously or in sequence) were chosen. In addition, two different infill patterns (line and gyroid) and building directions (horizontal and vertical) have been used. Concerning the polymer filaments, two commercial polylactic acid (PLA 3D870 and PLA 3D850) having different crystallization kinetics were used. The effect of the printing time delay between each layer on the temperature profile and the crystallization evolution was studied using a finite element analysis method simulation. The simulation results show a greater thermal excursion for longer delay times between the layers and with a crystallization degree evolution characterized by a step pattern. Moreover, a major density of crystals appears in the center of the final part. A new approach was adapted to measure the volumetric contraction of the material as a function of the temperature; it was performed with a gap test using a rotational rheometer under static conditions (without external deformation). The normal force measured from the test has shown a faster and higher increase of the contraction for the material with faster crystallization kinetics and with a higher degree of crystallinity. The results concerning the tensile properties show better rigidity for the samples printed in sequence due to the minor time of delay between the deposited layers. The mesostructure of the printed parts was analyzed with an X-ray tomography and a scanning electron microscope. The highest difference is presented from the PLA 3D870 characterized by the highest rate of crystallization resulting in more microvoids compared with the PLA 3D850, due to the less welding cohesion between the layers.",

    "abstract": "Vascularization is essential for the regeneration of three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting organs. As a general method to produce microfluidic channels in 3D printing constructs, coaxial extrusion has attracted great attention. However, the biocompatible bioinks are very limited for coaxial extrusion to fabricate microchannels with regular structure and enough mechanical properties. Herein, a hybrid bioink composed of alginate (Alg) and silk fibroin (SF) was proposed for 3D bioprinting of microchannel networks based on coaxial extrusion. The rheological properties of the bioink demonstrated that the hybrid Alg/SF bioink exhibited improved viscosity and shear thinning behavior compared with either pure Alg or SF bioink and had similar storage and loss modulus in a wide range of shear frequency, indicating a sound printability. Using a coaxial extrusion system with calcium ions and Pluronic F127 flowing through the core nozzle as cross-linkers, the Alg/SF bioink could be extruded and deposited to form a 3D scaffold with interconnected microchannels. The regular structure and smooth pore wall of microchannels inside the scaffold were demonstrated by optical coherence tomography. Micropores left by the rinse of F127 were observed by scanning electron microscope, constituting a hierarchical structure together with the microchannels and printed macropores. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis proved the complete rinse of F127 and the formation of β-sheet SF structure. Thus, Alg/SF could form a double cross-linked network, which was much stronger than the pure Alg network. Moreover, cells in the Alg/SF scaffold showed higher viability and proliferation rate than in the Alg scaffold. Therefore, Alg/SF is a promising bioink for coaxial extrusion-based 3D bioprinting, with the printed microchannel network beneficial for complex tissue and organ regeneration.",

    "abstract": "As applications of three-dimensional (3D) printed medical products are being translated into clinical practice, stakeholders are increasingly concerned about whether current regulatory frameworks are able to regulate such products. With more additive manufacturing (AM) and 3D printed medical products being brought into clinical use and the assumption that usage will be more widespread in the future, a (perceived) lack of or inadequacy of regulation by some stakeholders is often depicted as a hindrance to the comprehensive translation of AM and 3D printed medical products into clinical use. This article addresses this uncertainty by analyzing existing medical product regulations and their applicability to AM and 3D printed medical products to assess the degree of regulatory oversight they administer. It concludes that there are specific legal questions that need to be clarified, but the products are not expected to \"disrupt\" existing legal frameworks.",

    "abstract": "With additive manufacturing increasingly being embraced in the area of sports technology, focus has shifted toward cellular structures for impact protection. Periodic lattice structures can be tailored for a specific response by modifying the geometry of individual cells, with the structure capable of being modified to conform around a given body. However, the effect of modifying specific design characteristics within a lattice and the interrelationships between them are not well understood. This study examines five geometric design variables: cell width, strut cross-sectional area (CSA), strut shape, cell orientation, and joint filleting, and their effect on the compressive behavior of a lattice structure. Truncated octahedron lattices were manufactured using nylon through the process of material extrusion and tested under compression at a constant strain rate of 1.0 s-1. Design of experiments was utilized to analyze the results by implementing a 2(5-1) factorial design. Results indicated that the strut CSA, cell width, and interaction between the two design characteristics had the largest effects on the plateau stress of the lattice and its energy capacity.",

    "abstract": "Nickel-titanium (NiTi) alloys have shown promise for a variety of biomedical applications because of their unique properties of shape memory, superelasticity, and low modulus of elasticity (Young's modulus). Nevertheless, NiTi bulk components cannot be easily machined (e.g., CNC, rolling, grinding, casting, or press molding) due to their thermomechanical sensitivity as well as inherent superelasticity and shape memory. Thus, powder bed fusion (PBF) additive manufacturing has been used to successfully fabricate NiTi medical devices that match the geometric and mechanical needs of a particular patient's condition. However, NiTi PBF fabrication leaves unmelted particles from the source powder adhered to external surfaces, which cause minor dimensional inaccuracy, increase the risk of mechanical failure, and once loose, may irritate or inflame surrounding tissues. Therefore, there is a need to develop a chemical polishing (cleaning) technique to remove unmelted powder from the surfaces of PBF-fabricated implants, especially from inner surfaces that are difficult to access with mechanical polishing tools. This technique is especially useful for highly porous devices printed at high resolution. In this study, a chemical polishing method utilizing HF/HNO3 solution was used to remove loosely attached (i.e., unmelted) powder particles from surfaces of porous, skeletal fixation plates manufactured by PBF AM. It was observed that 7 min of polishing in an HF/HNO3 solution comprising 7.5 HF: 50 HNO3: 42.5 H2O enabled successful removal of all relatively loose and unmelted powder particles. A microcomputed tomography study examination found that the volumetric accuracy of the polished skeletal fixation plates was ±10% compared with the computer-aided design (CAD) model from which it was rendered. This postprocessing chemical polishing protocol is also likely to be useful for removing loose powder, while maintaining CAD model accuracy and mechanical stability for other complexly shaped, porous, three-dimensional (3D), printed NiTi devices.",

    "abstract": "Fused deposition modeling polymer 3D printing has become a popular versatile additive manufacturing technology. However, there are limitations to the mechanical properties due to the layer-by-layer deposition approach. The relatively low strength of the interface between layers is the cause for potential microstructural weak points in such printed components. The interface strength of 3D-printed Polylactic Acid (PLA) polymer was determined through physical tensile testing in combination with microstructural finite element method (FEM) simulations. A custom tensile specimen was created to isolate the interlayer interfaces for direct testing of interface strength. Tensile tests resulted in an average 2.4 GPa stiffness and an average 22.8 MPa tensile strength for printed specimens, corresponding to a 32.4% and 47.8% reduction from the bulk filament stiffness and strength, respectively. Sectioned tensile specimens were observed under a digital microscope to examine microstructural features such as inter-layer gaps, extrusion cross-section, and voids. These were measured to create accurate FEM microstructural model geometries. The brittle fracture that occurred during the tensile testing was due to debonding of the interfaces. This was represented in Abaqus by using cohesive surfaces. Interface strength was inferred by varying the strength of the cohesive surfaces until the simulation mechanical response matched the physical tests. The resulting interface strength of the PLA polymer was 33.75 MPa on average, corresponding to a 22.5% reduction from bulk properties. Potential improvements to the overall strength of the 3D printed PLA were investigated in simulation by parameterizing improved gap morphologies. As the size of the interlayer gaps decreased, the stiffness and strength of the printed parts improved, whereas completely eliminating gaps resulted in a potential 16.1% improvement in material stiffness and 19.8% improvement in strength. These models show that significant improvements can be made to the overall printed part performance by optimizing the printing process and eliminating inner voids.",

Additive manufacturing (AM) is a process that promises to impact all aspects of building construction profoundly.

The presented research focuses on fiber-reinforced polymers, with anisotropic mechanical properties ideally suited for AM applications that include tailored structural reinforcement. This article presents a cyber-physical manufacturing process that enhances existing robotic coreless Filament Winding (FW) methods for glass and carbon fiber-reinforced polymers. Our main contribution is the complete characterization of a feedback-based, sensor-informed application for process monitoring and fabrication data acquisition and analysis. The proposed AM method is verified through the fabrication of a large-scale demonstrator. The main finding is that implementing AM in construction through cyber-physical robotic coreless FW leads to more autonomous prefabrication processes and unlocks upscaling potential.

The success of DIW process depends on well-printable ink and optimized process parameters. After ink preparation, DIW process parameters considerably affect the parts' dimensional accuracy, and process parameters optimization for dimensional accuracy of printed layers is necessary for quality control of parts in DIW. In this study, DIW process parameters were identified and divided into two categories as the parameters for printing a line and the parameter from lines to a layer. Then, a two-step method was proposed for optimizing process parameters. Step 1 was to optimize process parameters for printing a line. In Step 1, continuity and uniformity of extruded filaments and printed rectangular objects were observed in screening experiments to determine printability windows for each process parameter. Then, interaction effect tests were conducted and degree of freedom for experiments was calculated followed by orthogonal array selection for the Taguchi design. Next, main experiments of line printing based on the Taguchi method were conducted. Signal-to-noise ratio calculations and analysis of variance were performed to find the optimal combination and evaluate the significance, respectively. Step 2 was to optimize the parameter from lines to a layer. In Step 2, the average width of the printed line under optimal condition was first measured. Then, single-factor tests of rectangular object printing were conducted to find the optimal parameter from lines to a layer. After these two steps, confirmation results were conducted to verify the reliability of the proposed method and the method robustness on other shapes and other materials; parameter adaptability in 3D parts printing from printed layers' analyses for the proposed method; and parameter adaptability in constructs fabricated as 100% infill or with porosities.",

A stable filament feeding region was determined with an upper limit in the volume flow rate at different nozzle temperatures. Within the limit, the steady-state temperature fields inside the hot-end were studied by a computational fluid dynamics model. Simulations indicated that the temperature became less homogeneous at higher flow rates, leading to a lower extrudate temperature at the nozzle outlet. These outlet temperatures were analyzed, validated, and used as input to simulate temperature variations in printed parts with a self-developed open-access numerical model. An interlayer time similarity rule was found in printing single-walled geometries, which specifies temperature similarities at the same interlayer time.

In this work, the copper (Cu) electrodes prepared using the direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) process are used for the EDM process. The performance of the DMLS Cu electrode is studied by machining the AA4032-TiC composite material using the EDM process. Then the performance of the DMLS Cu electrode is compared with the conventional Cu electrode. Three input parameters, such as peak current (A), pulse on time (s), and gap voltage (v), are selected for the EDM process. The performance measures, which are determined during the EDM process, are material removal rate (MRR), tool wear rate, surface roughness (SR), microstructural analysis of machined surface, and residual stress. At a higher pulse on time, more material was removed from the workpiece surface and thus MRR is enhanced. Likewise, at a higher peak current, the SR is amplified and thus wider craters are formed on the machined surface. The residual stress on the machined surface has influenced the formation of craters, microvoids, and globules. Lower SR and residual stress are attained by using DMLS Cu electrode, whereas MRR is higher when using conventional Cu electrode.",

However, many parts with intricate geometries have overhang structures, which are not easily fabricated by using LPBF and are often downgraded by staircase effects, warpage, cracks, and dross formation. Thus, the present study proposes a combined numerical and experimental approach for determining the optimal settings of the laser power and scanning speed that minimize the surface roughness and maximize the density of Inconel 718 LPBF overhang structures. In the proposed approach, the heat transfer simulations are employed to determine the melt pool depth, the melt pool length, and the solid cooling rate within the feasible input space of laser power and scanning speed combinations. Notably, the simulations take account of both the difference in the material properties of the solid and powder materials, respectively, and the variation of the laser absorptivity in the depth direction of the powder layer. The simulation results are then used to train artificial neural networks for predicting the melt pool depth for 3600 combinations of the laser power and scanning speed within the input space. The resulting processing maps are screened in accordance with three quality criteria (namely the melt pool depth, the melt pool length, and the solid cooling rate) to determine the optimal processing region, which improves the surface roughness. The feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated by fabricating 10 × 10 and 20 × 20 mm",

The main reason for this is that their mechanical properties are limited due to weak interlayer strength, porosity, and low fiber fraction. Therefore, the effects of many parameters, such as layer thickness, temperature, printing speed, and fiber fraction, have been extensively studied to improve mechanical properties. With a different perspective on these parameters, this study aimed to investigate the effect of fiber bundle size on the mechanical properties of CFRTP composites. For this purpose, 3K and 6K fiber bundle filaments with the same fiber volume fractions (∼41%) were produced utilizing a polymer impregnation setup. CFRTP samples were printed using fused deposition modeling with polylactic acid as the matrix. The mechanical properties were investigated via three-point bending, interlaminar shear strength (ILSS), and tensile tests. The results showed that fiber bundle size does not particularly influence tensile strength but dominates flexural and ILSS performance. Although increased flexural strength and modulus were observed, the bundle size effect was much more dominant in ILSS tests, and 6K bundle size samples with the same fiber fraction showed much higher strength.",

It emphasizes the material extrusion 3D printing technology and some of the most commonly used materials, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG). Optimizable process parameters such as, print angle, outer layer number, extruder flow ratio, extrusion (nozzle) temperature, and layer thickness are examined. The article also highlights the importance of postprocessing techniques, specifically thermal postprocessing (annealing) and chemical postprocessing in the acetone (AC) chamber, to enhance mechanical properties of printed parts. The results show that the wall structures played a crucial role in defining mechanical properties, acting as main load-bearing elements. Adjusted flow ratios influenced mechanical properties. Samples with a 25% extruder flow rate increase demonstrated a 44% rise in elongation at break, while a 50% increase led to slight strength reduction. The ABS material AC-treated sample exhibited 58.2% lower tensile strength and 1.9% lower elongation due to stress concentration, while thermally treated showed similar results to the default, printed at manufacturer-recommended settings. The PETG material AC-treated sample exhibited 53.2% lower tensile strength, but 17.5% higher elongation, while thermally treated showed similar results to the default. Samples printed at 0° orientation exhibited plastic deformation with the highest tensile strength and elongation, while samples at 45° and 90° orientations experienced delamination, leading to brittle fracture, proving that the orientation and interlayer adhesion have a great influence on mechanical properties. While the print settings and orientation had similar effects on mechanical properties of each material, postprocessing effects are greatly influenced by the polymer matrix.",

We have developed a fast parallel computation algorithm that predicts the optimal orientation of 3D printing using a general-purpose graphic processor unit (GPU). Initially designed for the central processing unit (CPU) version support structure tomography, our algorithm has been successfully adapted for NVIDIA graphic processors and the CUDA toolkit. Despite encountering several challenges, we have achieved a remarkable improvement in calculation speed. Two CPUs and four GPUs of various prices and performances were used for the speed comparison. The high-end GPU showed a surprising multiprocessing performance; a maximum of 16.2 times for Dragon mesh data and 11.2 times on average than the high-end CPU. The proposed method assumes that the input triangle should have a bigger size than the voxel size and a relatively smaller number of triangles, about tens of thousands. Nevertheless, the algorithm has the potential to significantly enhance the efficiency and quality of 3D printing, addressing some constraints and expanding its practical applications.",

    "abstract": "Regenerative design lies on synergistic relationship between sociocultural and ecological systems, which can enable revolutionary boundaries for designing decision-making frameworks. Transitioning to regenerative design as a manifestation of systems thinking necessitates a fundamental shift from sustainable patterns and mechanistic design methodologies. At its core, regenerative design unlocks a holistic paradigm that fosters circular systems reliant on renewable resources, which can strive for equilibrium between creation and utilization. This framework goes beyond mere sustainability by actively engaging in the restoration and regeneration of its sources of energy and materials. It aspires to harness the inherent wisdom of nature, facilitating a comprehensive harmonious coexistence with environment. The integration of data-driven decision-making and regenerative paradigms can provide an insight for developing evidence-based solutions for strategic environmental and natural resource management through design practices. This short research presents a holistic data-driven and self-adaptive design strategy as the integrated problem-solver model under the imperatives of regenerative adaptive design and transfer knowledge system capable of the extensive range of applications from microscale to macroscale. The underlying idea proposes orientation on machine learning feedback loop mechanisms and nested coevolutionary loops embedded in an inclusive feedback loop frame, synergistically interfaced with the typologies of monitoring systems and intuitive datasets to problem-solve at the intersection of design, construction, and built environment. This design model can support designers, planners, and city managers in optimizing their decision-making process by relying on precise data-driven feedback in different scales of complex systems, from living bits to ecological living environments.",

Experiments were conducted to establish photoencapsulation and fabrication parameter ranges tolerated by valve and mesenchymal stem cells, thereby enabling direct cell–hydrogel printing with optimal capacity for geometric control. Additionally, a dynamic conditioning system was designed specifically for the culture of 3D bioprinted valves.

A low-cost open-source 3D metal printer that utilizes gas metal arc welding technology has been developed that could make metal printing accessible to the average consumer. Unfortunately, this technology would demand access to expensive cutting tools for part removal from the substrate. This article investigates several substrate treatments to provide a low-cost method to easily remove 3D-printed 1100 aluminum parts from a reusable substrate. Coatings of aluminum oxide and boron nitride on 1100 aluminum and A36 low-carbon steel substrates were tested. Lap shear tests were performed to assess the interlayer adhesion between the printed metal part and the print substrate. No warping of the substrate was observed during printing. It was determined that boron nitride-coated low-carbon steel provided the lowest adhesion strength. Printing aluminum on uncoated low-carbon steel also allowed easy removal of the aluminum part with the benefit of no additional coating steps or costs.",

    "abstract": "Natural hierarchical structures, such as tree leaves or butterfly wings, have been broadly studied due to their exclusive functions, including ultralight nature, higher surface area-to-volume ratio, and high chemical reaction efficiency. In this study, we develop a 3D printed hierarchical gyroid structure with embedded TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) to investigate its effective photocatalytic structural performance for long-term application. Fused deposition modeling 3D printing is used to fabricate a gyroid structure with a functionalized photodegradable polylactic acid (PLA) containing embedded TiO2 NPs. The porous and 3D network gyroid structure provides more light pathways and surface area, which increases the contact interface and rapid mass transportation under UV irradiation. In addition, as the PLA is photodegraded at the surface over time, improved hierarchies are created within the structure. It allows the embedded TiO2 NPs to be continuously exposed to the surface along the hierarchical structure. As a result, the hierarchical gyroid structure not only maintains its reaction efficiency but also exhibits better adsorption and faster photocatalytic ability by the formation of additional voids as the reaction time is prolonged. This structural and material design approach will suit well for various applications, such as drug-eluting devices, water purification filters, or energy-harvesting devices.",

At Dayalbagh Educational Institute, we provide accessible 3DP resources for students by giving them an opportunity to design and build printers using open access technology and print 3D objects. This approach skills engineering graduates by providing them hands-on experience to turn their innovative ideas into reality.

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) printing (3DP) has received significant attention for its promise of reinventing the way products are manufactured. At times, there have been differences in the expectations of the public of what the technology would be able to do as compared with what the technology was capable of at a certain point in time. Although experts often feel that future improvements will overcome this, there is usually not a sense of how rapidly these future improvements will occur. The semiconductor industry and others have effectively addressed this problem by tracking how quickly the technology improves over time (i.e., Moore's law). This article looks at industrial stereolithography (SLA) 3DP and measures the technological improvement rate empirically at 37.6% per year and compares it with an estimate based on analysis of the patents that have been issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in SLA 3DP. This approach has been shown to give reliable estimates and in this SLA 3D case gives a very close estimate of 46.8% per year. We then find representative sets of patents and use the estimating technique to calculate the expected technological improvement rate for four other main types of 3DP: inkjet-powder-based 3DP (35.0%), metal selective laser sintering (SLS) (33.3%), fused filament fabrication (FFF) (16.7%), nonmetal SLS (21.1%), and for the 3DP domain as a whole (29.4%). Further analysis on the patent sets provides top assignees and the most central patents for each of the 3DP domains. Overall, the improvement rates found support the idea that 3DP is rapidly improving and, therefore, potentially capable of fulfilling its promise but also that some 3DP approaches (particularly FFF and nonmetal SLS) are likely improving at a lower rate.",

The sensor is capable of measuring temperature variations based on the change in resistance of the printed pattern. As PLA is insensitive to and insoluble in water, the sensor can be used both in air and under water without any need of encapsulation. Graphene nanorods give the printed patterns a conductive property, while the PLA acts as a binder matrix. When the temperature rises, there is physical expansion of the polymer matrix at microscopic level that reduces the contact between the conductive GNRs and the resistance increases. On cooling down, the physical properties are retained and the resistance drops again. The sensors show excellent linearity and stability when tested both in air and under water up to 70°C. Beyond this temperature, the deformation in the polymer matrix is permanent and the resistance does not return to its initial value. To minimize hysteresis, the recommended operation temperature is up to 60°C. The effect of pattern width and length has also been investigated that shows a direct relationship of resistance with the length, while an inverse relationship with the width as expected. The sensitivity of the linear sensors was calculated to be ∼13 Ω/°C, while the response and recovery times were 6 and 14 s, respectively. Based on their performance, the sensors can be efficiently used for general aquatic and terrestrial environmental monitoring.",

The results reveal that the debinding temperature >400°C resulted in negligible weight loss. Moreover, the crystallite size of the sintered alumina decreased with increasing debinding temperature. The lower debinding temperature of 300-350°C did not remove the photosensitive resin, which resulted in a loose lamellar structure. However, the higher debinding temperature (450-600°C) resulted in several irregular small-sized particles. Moreover, the size of alumina particles increased after the sintering process. The Raman analysis revealed that the debinded samples contain C, Al, and O; however, the C has not been detected after sintering. In general, the physical properties, such as shrinkage, open porosity, and relative density, exhibited a close relationship with the flexural strength, which is influenced by the debinding temperature. Based on the physical properties and processing requirements, the optimal vacuum debinding temperature should be in the range of 400-500°C.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether a ventilator can be modified to provide ventilation of two or more patients simultaneously by using 3D designed and manufactured splitters. A two-port and four-port splitter were designed in Autodesk Fusion 360 computer program and manufactured by 3D printer using PolyJet technology (Stratasys J750). Two sets of splitters were used to adapt to the ventilator during trial process: one for inspiratory and one for expiratory outputs. Two intensive care specialists voluntarily tried this study on themselves.

One possible approach is to increase the laser power and scan speed. A customized high-speed and high-power LPBF system has been developed for this purpose. The current study investigated the surface roughness and near-surface porosity as a result of unsupported overhangs at varying inclination angles and orientations during the manufacturing of Ti6Al4V parts with this custom high-speed and high-power LPBF system. It is known that surface roughness and porosity are among the main drawbacks for parts manufactured by LPBF, and that supports are required for overhang regions with low inclination angles relative to the powder bed, typically in commercial LPBF systems requiring supports for regions with inclination angles less than 45°. However, the appropriate inclination angles for this custom system with high power and speed requires investigation. In this article, a simple benchmark test artefact with different inclination angles was manufactured in different orientations on the build platform and characterized by X-ray tomography, touch probe roughness meter, optical microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The analysis of surface roughness and near-surface porosity at upskin and downskin regions was performed as a function of inclination angle. The results indicate that the high-speed LPBF process produces relatively high roughness in all cases, with different porosity distributions at upskin and downskin areas. Both roughness and porosity vary as a function of inclination angle. Significant warping was observed, depending on build orientation relative to laser scanning direction. These are the first reported results of the detailed surface roughness and porosity characterization of part quality from such a high-speed, high-power LPBF process.",

    "abstract": "The use of biobased materials in additive manufacturing is a promising long-term strategy for advancing the polymer industry toward a circular economy and reducing the environmental impact. In commercial 3D printing formulations, there is still a scarcity of efficient biobased polymer resins. This research proposes vegetable oils as biobased components to formulate the stereolithography (SLA) resin. Application of nanocellulose filler, prepared from agricultural waste, remarkably improves the printed material's performance properties. The strong bonding of nanofibrillated celluloses' (NFCs') matrix helps develop a strong interface and produce a polymer nanocomposite with enhanced thermal properties and dynamical mechanical characteristics. The ultra-low NFC content of 0.1–1.0 wt% (0.07–0.71 vol%) was examined in printed samples, with the lowest concentration yielding some of the most promising results. The developed SLA resins showed good printability, and the printing accuracy was not decreased by adding NFC. At the same time, an increase in the resin viscosity with higher filler loading was observed. Resins maintained high transparency in the 500–700 nm spectral region. The glass transition temperature for the 0.71 vol% composition increased by 28°C when compared to the nonreinforced composition. The nanocomposite's stiffness has increased fivefold for the 0.71 vol% composition. The thermal stability of printed compositions was retained after cellulose incorporation, and thermal conductivity was increased by 11%. Strong interfacial interactions were observed between the cellulose and the polymer in the form of hydrogen bonding between hydroxyl and ester groups, which were confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. This research demonstrates a great potential to use acrylated vegetable oils and nanocellulose fillers as a feedstock to produce high-performance resins for sustainable SLA 3D printing.",

In this study, soft heating elements were developed by combining thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) with carbon black. In contrast to previous studies on thermoplastic polymer-based thermistors, the heating elements could endure elongations above 100%. Due to the high melting point of the TPU and the carbon filler, the thermistors could be heated up to 180°C without significant deformation. The heating elements were extruded on TPU substrates using material extrusion additive manufacturing in one-step process. Self-regulating behavior to control the maximum temperature was achieved with the application of two different voltages (20 and 25 V) and different current thresholds, between 100 and 800 mA. The heating performance was adjusted by changing the geometry of the sensing elements; an increase in cross section resulted in a lower current density and lower temperature. For the heating elements, variation of the additive manufacturing parameters such as offset, layer height, nozzle speed, and extrusion multiplier resulted in a different width/height aspect ratio of the cross section of the extruded lines, affecting the initial resistivity of the thermistor. Orientation of the carbon filler during extrusion process is one reason for the small change of the longitudinal conductivity of the heating elements. The resulting skin with the integrated heating elements allowed the possibility to perform the",

While the range of available materials continues to grow, the field of elastic printable materials for medical applications has not been fully explored. Therefore, this study focuses on the comparison of six commercially available flexible printing materials regarding their usability in the medical field. Surface of printed parts for all materials were analyzed directly after printing by scanning electron microscopy. The mechanical behavior was evaluated by uniaxial tensile tests, shore A hardness, and vascular compliance analysis. The degradation effects of the solvents water, glycerin, and ethanol were analyzed over a period of 7 days. The impact of different sterilization protocols (steam, plasma, ethylene oxide) was determined by tensile testing and surface imaging. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by a WST-1 proliferation assay with human endothelial cells. Microscopic imaging revealed a uniform surface with characteristic topologies depending on the printing technique. Different sterilization techniques revealed good results, however, pure silicone material TrueSil® showed complete mechanical failure after plasma sterilization. All materials demonstrated high resistance to water and glycerin exposure with only slight weight changes. Ethanol exposure led to significant increases in wet weight with Agilus30 reaching a weight increase of 104.6%. All materials except Aceo showed a decrease in dry weight after ethanol exposure. Formlabs' Flexible 80A and Elastic 50A, as well as Agilus30, showed high cytotoxicity with no cell viability after 24 h. Aceo and TrueSil silicone materials revealed adequate cytocompatibility with viable cells even after 7 days. Static and dynamic vascular elasticity of all tested materials revealed linear elastic behavior. The tested materials offer unique material properties for different use cases, with the recapitulation of vascular elasticity still being a weak point of current printing technologies.",

This study investigates the relationship between material rheology, process parameters, and scaffold characteristics during 3D bioplotting of polycaprolactone (PCL). The effects of two process parameters, extrusion temperature and nozzle diameter, on resultant scaffold structure and compression strength were studied using design of experiments. PCL scaffolds designed for a 24-well culture plate (Ø 14 mm × 2 mm) were bioplotted in a 0°/90° laydown pattern at three levels of extrusion temperature (80°C, 90°C, and 100°C) and two levels of nozzle inner diameter (0.3 and 0.4 mm) at a constant extrusion pressure (0.35 N/mm2) and nozzle speed (1.2 mm/s). The relationship between PCL dynamic viscosity and extrusion temperature during bioplotting was then determined using rheological measurements. The ANOVA results demonstrated that the strand width and porosity significantly varied as a function of the extrusion temperature, the nozzle inner diameter, and the interaction of the two parameters (p < 0.05). The compression modulus of scaffolds fabricated at the different experimental levels also showed an increasing trend (0.5 – 0.97 MPa) with extrusion temperature for a given nozzle diameter. Rheological analysis at the three extrusion temperatures showed the average viscosity to be significantly different at each level (p < 0.05). The apparent viscosity of PCL at the nozzle tip during 3D bioplotting was also estimated, showing a steep decrease with increasing extrusion temperature and nozzle diameter. Finally, predictive regression models to estimate the scaffold characteristics based on the 3D bioplotting process parameters were developed.",

Cultivation of benthic algal biofilm communities, in particular, shows promise for these functions, yet control of quality and yield are strongly dependent on substrata characteristics that affect algal attachment and growth. No previous research efforts have taken advantage of the recent developments in additive technology to support algal biofilm development. Additive manufacturing allows for the design and control of surface features and provides a platform for developing substrata with surface topographies customized for algal colonization. This article seeks to establish the feasibility of colonizing 3D-printed custom substrata with algal biomass. Three exploratory experiments on algal biofilm colonization of printed surfaces were conducted under a variety of laboratory and natural environments, and all printed substrata showed various degrees of colonization success. The preliminary results seem to indicate that (1) 3D-printed substrata can be successfully colonized by algal communities; (2) there is a roughness effect on the colonization rate of benthic algae; (3) substratum roughness can be designed for optimal interstitial spacing between surface asperities, providing refugia for regenerative growth that allows shorter lifecycles of the next algae crop; and (4) increased efficiencies in the packing of biomass can be achieved by complex 3D-printed geometries that provide very high surface area in compact volumes. Future research will seek to quantify these effects as well as to establish substrata conditions that optimize attachment, colonization, and regeneration rates.",

In this study, the effects of build orientation, hatch spacing, and heat treatment on the wear performance of medical Ti6Al4V alloy were investigated. The tribological properties of the samples produced by SLM were compared with the tribological characteristics of the parts produced by conventional method (casting). It was determined that the wear resistance of Ti6Al4V alloy increased with the decreasing of hatch spacing in SLM and the wear resistance of the 45° angle on the production table positively affected the relative density rate. The highest surface hardness among the samples was obtained as ∼360 HV0.3 for the sample produced at the 60 μm hatch spacing and 45° build orientation, which was the highest densification rate obtained. The lowest wear rate value was obtained for the sample produced at 60 μm hatch spacing and 45° build orientation where the highest densification rate and highest surface hardness were obtained. The wear rate of this sample was 26% lower than the wear rate of the sample produced by the casting method.

    "abstract": "Elastomers and rubber are common industrial materials used for test objects, supporting parts, and many other commercial products. The industrial processing of these materials is currently dominated by injection molding, which reduces manufacturing costs and speeds up production. However, this manufacturing method does not permit personalization or customization and lacks the versatility of other techniques such as three-dimensional printing. Understandably, there has been a move toward additive manufacturing (AM) with elastomers. This work proposes a new approach to AM with liquid latex, using a drop-on-demand (DoD) based inkjet to fabricate latex patterns. The printhead actuator benefits from a higher material compatibility compared to conventional inkjet/extrusion-based printers, allowing the jetting of viscous fluids, as well as liquids with high solid loading. The setup allows printing with viscous liquid latex of a high solid content (60 wt. %). The process is controllable and reliable, making the printing of patterns possible. In addition, we explore printing with micronized rubber powder (MRP) made from end-of-life tires, to test solid-particle loading compatibility and as a novel method for rubber recycling. In this study, we demonstrate that large-scale DoD inkjet printing is capable of handling solid particle loadings of up to 10 wt. % in addition to the high solid content liquid latex. Moreover, multilayer objects were created from pure liquid latex, as well as from MRP/latex suspensions. Material characterization indicates that the stiffness of cured latex is not altered by the addition of MRP, but reduces the maximum elongation length from 750% to 430%. The results highlight the ability to print with both high particle loading and large particles. This explorative study demonstrates the potential of AM processes with liquid latex, as well as a new approach to tire rubber reuse.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) enables the fabrication of lattice structures with optimal mechanical, fluid, and thermal properties. However, during the AM fabrication process, defects are produced in the strut and node elements, which comprise the lattice structure. This leads to discrepancies between the AM fabricated lattice and its idealized computer-aided design (CAD) model, negatively affecting the ability to predict the mechanical behavior of the fabricated lattice via numerical models. Current research is focused on quantification of geometric uncertainties in the strut elements of the lattice; as-manufactured node geometries remain relatively unexplored on an individual scale, despite their criticality to the mechanical response of the structure. Understanding the geometrical properties of as-manufactured nodes relative to CAD idealizations can be used to improve lattice designs and numerical models. In this research, X-ray microcomputed tomography (μCT) is used to analyze and quantify the as-manufactured nodal geometry, found in face-centered cubic and face-centered cubic with axial struts lattices fabricated via selective laser melting. A custom tool is developed that enables auto-isolation and classification of nodal joints from μCT-derived cross-sectional slices. Geometrical properties are extracted from the isolated nodal cross sections and compared with their idealized CAD model counterpart. Quantification of geometrical defects provides insight into how nodes within an AM lattice structure differ from each other and their idealized design. Overall, this research is an initial step toward developing accurate and efficient numerical models, as well as better node design for AM.",

In response to these issues, this article established a numerical model of temperature field and thermal stress field for FDM by finite element modeling and \"birth–death element\" technique to predict the deformation of the part. What makes sense in this process is that the logic of elements sort based on ANSYS Parametric Design Language (APDL) was proposed to sort the meshed elements, which was aimed to perform FDM simulation quickly on the model. In this work, the effects of the sheets shape and infill line directions (ILDs) on the distortion during FDM were simulated and verified. From the analysis of stress field and deformation nephogram, the simulation results indicated that ILD had greater effects on the distortion. Moreover, the sheet warping became most serious when the ILD was aligned with the diagonal of the sheet. The simulation results matched well with the experimental results. Thus, the proposed method in this work can be used to optimize the printing parameters for FDM process.",

    "abstract": "Al-6.0Mg-0.3Sc alloy deposits are prepared by means of a double-wire arc additive manufacturing process. The formation, porosity, metallographic structure, type of precipitated phase, and mechanical properties of the deposit are studied. Double-wire arc forming affords precision advantages over single-wire-arc forming, which is evidenced by the increased surface uniformity of the deposit. Compared with the deposit of single-wire-arc formed, the deposit of double-wire arc formed exhibits only fewer and smaller pores, and the lower process heat yields rapid solidification and tiny precipitate sizes. A larger amount of Mg and Mn is observed to be dissolved in the Al matrix of double-wire arc-formed deposit, which increases the alloy strength, and smaller primary Al3Sc phase, which exhibits excellent grain refinement. Furthermore, the presence of a high amount of Sc solid solution in the matrix of double-wire arc-formed deposit strengthens the alloy, and the melting of the rear wire \"heat-treats\" the substrate formed by the front wire, promotes secondary Al3Sc phase precipitation, and further strengthens the alloy. Compared with the deposit of single-wire-arc formed, the mechanical properties of double-wire arc-formed deposit show an improvement: the tensile strength, yield strength, and elongation of the horizontally oriented specimens are estimated as 363 MPa, 258 MPa, and 26%, respectively. This successful implementation of the cold metal transfer + pulse process to prepare Al-Mg alloy parts can pave the way to their industrial production. The proposed method can find wide utility in the fields of aviation, aerospace, military, and shipbuilding.",

The v1 geometry, which gives the analysis results for ideal printing quality from the channel geometries developed with three different design approaches, is produced with direct metal laser sintering, which is an AM laser sintering technology, and the injection printing cycle time has been reduced by 38%. CCC applied the study's primary motivation to develop duct geometry to provide balanced cooling in the automotive industry's mold cores produced with AM. It is known that the Computer Numerical Control machining process in traditional mold methods does not allow the processing of the channels in the internal geometries, and the deep areas where the heat is concentrated cannot be cooled sufficiently. In the study, CCC geometries where AM design parameters are used effectively and the balanced cooling performance expected from the die core can be achieved.

Fused deposition modeling (FDM) shows a huge potential of shift from rapid prototyping toward the rapid manufacturing. Nowadays, the strength of the FDM-printed parts is very important to consider along with all the printing parameters, which affect the strength of these parts. This study includes the investigation of printing parameters (infill density, layer thickness, and shell count) on the strength of FDM-printed parts of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and carbon fiber-reinforced ABS (ABS-CF). These printing parameters directly affect the quality as well as the strength of the 3D-printed parts through FDM. Tensile tests were performed on the universal testing machine on both types of printed parts. The optimized parameters for the 3D-printed samples of the pristine ABS are found to be 0.1045 mm of layer thickness, 57.72% of infill density, and 7.63 numbers of shell count, while the optimum parameters obtained for ABS-CF are 0.2780 mm of layer thickness, 28.37% of infill density, and 9.88 numbers of shell count. The results show that the layer thickness and shell count have a significant effect on the ultimate tensile strength of the 3D-printed parts.",

To this end, the present study investigates a machine learning approach for predicting mechanical properties for Ti-6Al-4V fabricated through laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB) AM using in situ photodiode processing signals. Samples were fabricated under different processing parameters, varying laser powers and scan speeds for the purpose of probing a wide range of microstructure and property variations. Photodiode data were collected during fabrication, later to be arranged in image format and extracted to information-dense vectors by the transferal of deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) structures and weights pretrained on a large computer vision benchmark image database. The extracted features were then used to train and test a newly designed regression model for mechanical properties. Average cross-validation accuracies were found to be 98.7% (r2 value of 0.89) for the prediction of ultimate tensile strength, which ranged from 900 to 1150 MPa in the samples studied, and 93.1% (r2 value of 0.96) for the prediction of elongation to fracture, which ranged from 0 to 17%. Thus, with high accuracy and hardware-accelerated inference speeds, we demonstrate that a transfer learning framework can be used to predict strength and ductility of metal AM components based on processing signals in PBF-LB, illustrating a potential route toward real-time closed-loop control and process optimization of PBF-LB in industrial applications.",

    "abstract": "Hollow-core 3D printing (HC3DP) proposes a new method for the production of lightweight, material-efficient thermoplastic 3D printed elements. This new fabrication approach promises material savings of 50-80%, while increasing the extrusion rate significantly (factor 10). This development pushes HC3DP to a similar fabrication speed as high-resolution concrete 3D printing. However, fundamental research on printing features enabled by this novel 3D printing approach is missing. Therefore, this article investigates printing with user-controlled bead dimensions (same nozzle, different size). It is showcased that the size of the extruded cross-section is determined by the positive air pressure used to inflate the beads. Multiple samples are printed, changing the layer height and width significantly without making changes to the hardware setup. Sections of 3DP samples are analyzed and the parameters of 3DP beads are determined. Furthermore, a set of bespoke 3D printed nozzles is introduced to subdivide the HC3DP beads into distinct areas. So far only regular beads, such as hollow tubes, have been used for 3D printing. Samples of those bespoke sections are analyzed to investigate their behavior when used for 3D printing. Finally, large-scale 3D printing experiments are conducted to investigate how printing features like bridging, cantilevering, or nonplanar 3D printing can be manufactured with hollow extrusion beads. In summary, this article provides insights into the fundamental 3D printing behaviors of HC3DP, showcases new design possibilities with bespoke and variable cross-sections, and finally proposes new research trajectories based on the findings presented.",

Certain dimensioning challenges were encountered because laser melting is not yet accurate enough for some features, but these challenges were circumvented. The manifold was successfully manufactured from tool steel and tested for maximum operating pressure and flow capacity. Due to the improved flow channels, the selective laser melted manifold provided up to 49% reduction in the energy losses caused by flow resistance.

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) printing is a powerful rapid manufacturing technology with wide applicability in scientific research, in industry, and for the home hobbyist. A popular 3D printing discipline known as fused deposition modeling (FDM) has several shortcomings, including stairstepping in the approximation of curves, anisotropy in physical properties, and the need for support material in models with large overhangs and severe angles. These limitations are especially concerning in 3D bioprinting of tissue constructs that contain voids, including a host of tubular biological structures such as vasculature, intestine, respiratory tissue, and long bone. The use of sacrificial support material can lead to excessive printing time, while its exclusion may lead to mid-print or postprint tissue collapse. Additive-lathe 3D printing technology is an emerging discipline in the field of additive manufacturing and offers a unique method for FDM printing that promises to circumvent some of these inadequacies while adding value as an alternative printing technique. The technology has seen use in several fields in recent years, yet researchers making gains in disparate fields appear to have not fully realized each other's advancements. This review aims to summarize the history and current state of additive-lathe 3D printing, comparing the hardware and software approaches of each embodiment, as well as their output. The review will go on to provide interdisciplinary insight into the utility, limitations, and potential future trends in this growing additive manufacturing technology.",

The results indicate that, although the filaments vary significantly in terms of porosity and inclusions, the prints are reasonably unaffected by these factors and dimensionally very accurate. This indicates that filament quality is not of major concern for consumer-level 3D printing. However, the presence of large inclusions could lead to nozzle blockages (and failed prints), and the presence of porosity will lead to weaker parts, which is of interest for more advanced applications.",

One of the silicones tested significantly slumped under its own weight and had a height decrease of 25% over 60 s if not in situ cured. Repulsion effects were observed due to tribocharging of the silicone and the UV curing process. Carbon black (CB) was added to the silicone to minimize repulsion effects, alleviate in-nozzle curing, and nozzle material accumulation. Durometer and tensile testing were used to compare mechanical properties of the silicone under different CB loading conditions. Higher loadings of CB abated repulsion effects and also significantly reduced the durometer and 100% secant modulus of elasticity of ASTM D638 Type 1 dogbone printed parts due to inhibition of UV curing depth. Postoven curing of samples increased the durometer and modulus of all samples tested. It was found that 0.15 wt% CB was optimal to reduce repulsion effects and to maintain durometer and secant modulus within −2.6% and −1.3% of bulk cast properties, respectively.",

The effects of various interpass temperatures on the deposition surface oxidation, geometry, pores, microstructure, and mechanical properties of the fabricated part were investigated. The results showed that with the decrease of interpass temperature, degree of surface oxidation decreases, width of deposits decreases, height of layer increases, porosity decreases, dendrites were eliminated, grains were refined, segregation of the harmful precipitated phases [β(Mg2Al3) and (FeMn)Al6] reduces, and the microstructure is homogenized. In addition, thermal history played a decisive role in improving the performance of the WAAM Al–Mg alloy. Reducing the interpass temperature effectively improved the mechanical properties and reduced the difference between the horizontal and vertical properties of the deposits.

Traditional approaches for the production of spheroids, such as the hanging drop method, are limited by the lack of reproducibility and the use of labor-intensive and time-consuming techniques. The need for high-throughput approaches allowing for the quick and reproducible formation of cell aggregates has driven the development of soft lithography techniques based on the patterning of microwells into nonadherent hydrogels. However, these methods are also limited by costly, labor-intensive, and multistep protocols that could impact the sterility of the process and efficiency of spheroid formation. In this study, we describe a one-step method for the fabrication of patterned nonadherent microwells into tissue culture plates using three-dimensional (3D) printed stamps and evaluate the production of cell spheroids of different sizes and cell sources. The generation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cell and endothelial cell spheroids by the use of 3D printed stamps was superior in comparison with a widely used multistep mold technique, yielding spheroids of larger sizes and higher DNA content. The 3D stamps produced spheroids of more consistent diameter and DNA content when compared with other commercially available methods. These 3D printed stamps offer a tunable, simple, fast, and cost-effective approach for the production of reproducible spheroids and organoids for a wide range of applications.",

    "abstract": "The potential use of additive manufacturing (AM) techniques for processing of food can span from satisfaction of basic necessities to high-end cuisine and fine dining. The purpose of this study was to explore how AM, specifically extrusion-based layer-wise deposition, can be combined with the reverse spherification technique that is widely used in molecular gastronomy. First, by manual extrusion, we identify suitable recipes and ingredient concentrations to form freestanding features in a liquid bath. Subsequently, a desktop extrusion is adapted for the deposition of a calcium solution into an alginate bath first as a two-dimensional (2D) pathway and then as three-dimensional (3D) geometry by layer-wise deposition. The 2D geometries are measured and compared to a nominal geometry, to elucidate how tool speed and extrusion rate influence form and dimensional accuracy. We demonstrate that motorized extrusion-based AM can be combined with reverse spherification to form stable objects by gelation of fruit-based solutions. In addition, a wider set of manual experiments shows the possibility of combining different flavors and the creation of complex multilayer and multiflavor objects. Additional studies on the deposition precision are required to optimize the process of creating a full 3D geometry. This study shows that 3D printing via reverse spherification can bridge the gap between culinary art and AM technology, and enable new capabilities for creation of dining experiences. This is a step toward the digital design and manufacturing of unique edible objects with complex flavors, textures, and geometries.",

Though capable of challenging its traditional counterpart, injection molding in specific cases, the current application of FDM is limited due to fewer material options and the need to have the raw material in the filament form often. Considering the significant role that the process is projected to play in widely varying fields of applications, the current research considers to evaluate certain biopolymer alternatives in pellet forms for extrusion three-dimensional (3D) printing. A variety of material alternatives are evaluated and three specific systems, ECOVIO F C2311, several grades of INGEO, and the wood-polymer composite NN41, were identified to be the most promising candidates in the forms tested for extrusion 3D printing with varying degrees of commercial viabilities.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we propose a novel synchronized dual bioprinting approach that combines two distinct printing strategies for mechanically and biologically improved substitutes for cartilage tissue engineering. Mechanical stability is achieved using a biomaterial ink (polysaccharide based) for microextrusion printing, whereas the cell-loaded functional bioink (type I collagen based) is bioprinted using cell compatible drop-on-demand (DoD) bioprinting. After an exploratory preselection of bioinks with printability and biocompatible characteristics, articular cartilage substitutes have been dually bioprinted using human knee articular chondrocytes (hKACs) from four independent donors. Our findings showed that dual bioprinting improves the compressive modulus from about 20 kPa (only bioink) to up to 600 kPa (bioink plus biomaterial ink). In addition, the biomaterial ink was found to be well interconnected with the bioink, which is important for future translational research. Chondrogenesis of hKACs was possible in functional bioinks with intermediate collagen concentration among the studied blends and satisfactory printability characteristics. We conclude that dual bioprinting is a promising and advanced strategy for cartilage tissue engineering.",

In this article, we investigate a novel constrained window design, namely Island Window (IW), for the continuous three-dimensional (3D) printing by using the projection SL process. The proposed IW window has a highly oxygen-permeable polydimethylsiloxane membrane onto the laser-machined acrylic vat frame, which allows the formation of an effective liquid interface (>200 μm oxygen inhibition layer) to enable the continuous projection SL process. Experimental results verified the feasibility of the window design for extending the maximum printing time (increased by up to 73%) due to the enhanced oxygen concentration. It was also found that the maximum printing speed for producing parts with a smooth surface (Rz <30 μm) can be as high as 90 mm/h, which is comparable to the speeds in recently reported continuous SL processes. In addition, a variety of parts were successfully fabricated through continuous 3D printing by using the proposed IW design, implying tremendous promise for future low-cost, high-resolution, easy-controlled, and ultra-fast AM processes.",

Coral is a potential bone repair and bone replacement material. Due to the natural source limitation of coral, we developed a fabrication protocol for 3D printing of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nanoparticles for coral replacement in the application of bone tissue engineering. Up to 80% of CaCO3 nanoparticles can be printed with high resolution using poly-l-lactide as a blender. The scaffolds were subjected to a controlled hydrothermal process for incomplete conversion of carbonate to phosphate to produce CaCO3 scaffold covered by hydroxyapatite (HA) to modify the biocompatibility and degradation of CaCO3/HA scaffolds. X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that HA was converted and attached to the surface of the scaffold, and the surface morphology and microstructure were studied using a scanning electron microscope. To confirm the bone regeneration performance of the scaffold, cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3 cells on the scaffold were evaluated. In addition, in vivo experiments showed that CaCO3/HA scaffolds can promote bone growth and repairing process and has high potential in bone tissue engineering.

    "abstract": "In this study, the effect of the post-curing process as well as the long-term weathering behavior were studied for three different three-dimensional printable, pigmented (black), nonstabilized, ultraviolet (UV) cure resin formulations (A and B being thiol-ene chemistry, and C being acrylate chemistry). To study the effect of the post-cure process, the printed parts were post-cured using one of five different processes: no post-cure, UV-only, heat-only, UV+heat, and electron beam (EB) post-curing. Bulk tensile properties and nanohardness were measured for each of the systems and post-cure conditions. For weathering studies, the parts were post-cured using the recommended UV-only process and exposed using the ASTM D7869 exterior weathering protocol. The results show that the post-cure process had a significant effect on the final mechanical properties of the resins and was dependent on the underlying resin chemistry. Thermal post-curing was not as effective as UV curing for Resin C compared with the two other resins, which could both undergo thermal polymerization. In addition, Resin B showed the smallest change in mechanical properties before and after post-curing, regardless of the type of post-curing process. EB post-curing, even at very low dosages, that is, from 0.05 to 1 Mrad, resulted in considerable post-cure cross-linking to the point of embrittlement and a significant drop in percent elongation at break for dosages above 0.5 Mrad. Although Resins A and C outperformed Resin B in photooxidation performance, all three resins demonstrated that promising results considering no hindered amine light stabilizers were used in the formulations.",

This article analyzes the literature around reported study cases that make use of anatomical models for their surgical processes' planning, focusing on obtaining the quantitative results of each one of them. A search of case studies was carried out in the main medical databases such as PubMed, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, among others; to obtain the most relevant results of the 56 selected articles, the information of each study was analyzed and categorized. These articles presented figures and data about the benefits that are considered more representative to measure the positive impact of this technology. These benefits are summarized in variables such as the decrease in surgical time, greater accuracy in the diagnosis of pathology, blood loss reduction, and decreasing operating room costs; owed to an improvement in the surgery planning. It was found that in all the cases analyzed there was an improvement in the surgical results related to these variables, which were summarized in macro figures that combine this improvement quantitatively. In the analyzed studies, it was evident that there is great potential in the use of 3D printing for presurgical planning, being as the results of these analyzed interventions were better when using this technology.

    "abstract": "Autologous bone remains the gold standard bone substitute in clinical practice. Therefore, the microarchitecture of newly developed synthetic bone substitutes, which reflects the spatial distribution of materials in the scaffold, aims to recapitulate the natural bone microarchitecture. However, the natural bone microarchitecture is optimized to obtain a mechanically stable, lightweight structure adapted to the biomechanical loading situation. In the context of synthetic bone substitutes, the application of a Triply Periodic Minimum Surface (TPMS) algorithm can yield stable lightweight microarchitectures that, despite their demanding architectural complexity, can be produced by additive manufacturing. In this study, we applied the TPMS derivative Adaptive Density Minimal Surfaces (ADMS) algorithm to produce scaffolds from hydroxyapatite (HA) using a lithography-based layer-by-layer methodology and compared them with an established highly osteoconductive lattice microarchitecture. We characterized them for compression strength, osteoconductivity, and bone regeneration. The in vivo results, based on a rabbit calvaria defect model, showed that bony ingrowth into ADMS constructs as a measure of osteoconduction depended on minimal constriction as it limited the maximum apparent pore diameter in these scaffolds to 1.53 mm. Osteoconduction decreased significantly at a diameter of 1.76 mm. The most suitable ADMS microarchitecture was as osteoconductive as a highly osteoconductive orthogonal lattice microarchitecture in noncritical- and critical-size calvarial defects. However, the compression strength and microarchitectural integrity in vivo were significantly higher for scaffolds with their microarchitecture based on the ADMS algorithm when compared with high-connectivity lattice microarchitectures. Therefore, bone substitutes with high osteoconductivity can be designed with the advantages of the ADMS-based microarchitectures. As TPMS and ADMS microarchitectures are true lightweight structures optimized for high mechanical stability with a minimal amount of material, such microarchitectures appear most suitable for bone substitutes used in clinical settings to treat bone defects in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing sites.",

At the state of the art, M-MEX techniques result underexploited for the manufacture of soft EM actuators: only traditional manufacturing approaches are used, resulting in many assembly steps.

This article aims to push the role of extrusion-based additive manufacturing for the fabrication of EM soft robots: several advantages such as portability, no cooling systems, fast responses, and noise reduction can be achieved by exploiting the proposed actuation system compared to the traditional and widespread actuation mechanisms (shape memory polymers, shape memory alloys, pneumatic actuation, and cable-driven actuation).",

These studies indicated that HIPEs tend to scatter the light during structuring through stereolithography, and can produce poorly defined and low-resolution structures, but the inclusion of light absorbers can drastically increase the printing resolution. In this study, we focused on the inclusion of biocompatible light absorbers within the resin and the compatibility of those resins with a commercial vat photopolymerization additive manufacturing (or stereolithography) setup. A surfactant (hypermer)-stabilized water-in-oil emulsion based on 2-ethylhexyl-acrylate and isobornyl-acrylate was used. For the light absorbers, both hydrophobic (beta-carotene) and hydrophilic (tartrazine) molecules were used, which dissolve in the organic phase and aqueous phase, respectively. It was found that using a combination of both beta-carotene and tartrazine provided the best stereolithography-based 3D printing resolution. In addition, the emulsion was stable for the duration of the printing process and showed a porous polyHIPE structure with open surface porosity. The formulation of these HIPE-based resins permits them to be used in a wide range of applications since complex structures could be fabricated from HIPEs.",

Polyamide (PA) has excellent mechanical properties, but its application in FDM is limited due to its high water absorption, warpage, and forming shrinkage. The material of the filament and the printing parameters of the printer are two critical aspects that affect the performance of a component. The prepared PA6/PA66 (composite polyamide [COPA], PA6:PA66 = 85:15) composite (COPA: acrylonitrile butadiene styrene [ABS]: maleic anhydride grafted acrylonitrile butadiene styrene [ABS-g-MAH]: polyethylene = 800:133:67:100) has low water absorption (0.39%) and high dimensional stability, which has a good application prospect in FDM. The influence of eight FDM parameters, including three rarely reported, on the properties of PA6/PA66 composite specimens was investigated by the Taguchi method. The significance of influencing factors was evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the stability by signal-noise ratio. When the layer thickness was 0.15 mm, the infill pattern was zigzags, the build plate adhesion type was brim, and the distance from the nozzle to the printing platform and the layer thickness (ΔL) was 0.05 mm; the specimens' dimensional accuracy, surface quality, and mechanical properties were better than other levels. The layer thickness and infill pattern were the two most important factors. The switch of the cooling fan and the temperature printing platform played a significant role in the specimens' dimensional accuracy and surface quality. ΔL tremendously influenced the thickness and warping degree of the specimens. The preparation of high-performance PA composites and the investigation of multiparameters by the Taguchi method provide a possible solution for applying polyamide in FDM.",

Torque rheometry analysis showed that the processability of vABS was not compromised with the addition of rABS. Rheological measurements showed that the viscosity of vABS was higher than that of rABS at low frequencies and indicated that vABS and rABS are immiscible. Impact strength (IS) tests of the 3D printed samples showed an increase in the IS with an increase in the rABS content up to 50 wt%.

    "abstract": "In this article, a method to develop 3D printable hybrid sodium alginate and albumin foam, crosslinked with calcium chloride mist is introduced. Using this method, highly porous structures are produced without the need of further postprocessing (such as freeze drying). The proposed method is particularly beneficial in the development of wound dressing as the printed foams show excellent lift-off and water absorption properties. Compared with methods that use liquid crosslinker, the use of mist prevents the leaching of biocompounds into the liquid crosslinker. 3D printing technique was chosen to provide more versatility over the wound dressing geometry. Calcium chloride and rhodamine B were used as the crosslinking material and the model drug, respectively. Various biomaterial inks were prepared by different concentrations of sodium alginate and albumin, and the fabricated scaffolds were crosslinked in mist, liquid, or kept without crosslinking. The effects of biomaterial composition and the crosslinking density on the wound dressing properties were assessed through printability studies. The mist-crosslinked biomaterial ink composed of 1% (w/v) sodium alginate and 12% (w/v) albumin showed the superior printability. The fabricated scaffolds were also characterized through porosity, mechanical, degradation, and drug release tests. The mist-crosslinked scaffolds showed superior mechanical properties and provided relatively prolonged drug release.",

    "abstract": "Lattice structures are composed of a collection of struts with different orientations. During slicing, the inclined struts generate multiple disjoint contours along the build direction in additive manufacturing (AM). These contours are substantially smaller in size due to the narrow cross-section of the individual lattice struts, and they can lead to contour plurality in AM processes. Contour plurality reduces the amount of continuous contact region between two successive layers, thus resulting in poor interlayer adhesion, structural integrity, and mechanical properties of the printed lattice structure. A new interlocking and assemble-based lattice structure building approach is investigated by increasing continuity in layers and avoiding support structure to minimize contour plurality. Two lattice configurations in the form of cubic and octet lattice structures are examined. The compressive performance of the designed lattice structures is compared with the traditional single-build direct three-dimensional printed lattice structures. The mechanical performance (e.g., peak stress, specific energy absorption) of the assembled structures is found to be generally better than their direct print counterparts. The empirical constants of Ashby-Gibson power law are found to be larger than their suggested values in both direct print and assembly techniques. However, their values are more compliant for octet assembled structures, which are less susceptible to manufacturing imperfections.",

    "abstract": "We present a generative approach for creating three-dimensional lattice structures optimized for mass and deflection composed of thousands of one-dimensional strut primitives. Our approach draws inspiration from topology optimization principles. The proposed method iteratively determines unnecessary lattice struts through stress analysis, erodes those struts, and then randomly generates new struts across the entire structure. The objects resulting from this distributed optimization technique demonstrate high strength-to-weight ratios that are at par with state-of-the-art topology optimization approaches, but are qualitatively very different. We use a dynamics simulator that allows optimization of structures subject to dynamic load cases, such as vibrating structures and robotic components. Because optimization is performed simultaneously with simulation, the process scales efficiently on massively parallel graphics processing units. The intricate nature of the output lattices contributes to a new class of objects intended specifically for additive manufacturing. Our work contributes a highly parallel simulation method and simultaneous algorithm for analyzing and optimizing lattices with thousands of struts. In this study, we validate multiple versions of our algorithm across sample load cases, to show its potential for creating high-resolution objects with implicit optimized microstructural patterns.",

The physiochemical properties of the AC/PCL composites were examined by measuring the water contact angles, dispersity of AC on the cross-section using scanning electron microscopy, and temperature stability. In addition, mechanical properties such as tensile strength and bending stress recovery were measured to determine the elasticity of the composite films. The fibroblast cell line NIH-3T3 was used to test the relative cell affinities based on the AC content and cell viability on AC/PCL at various temperatures. There was no difference between the melting points and tensile strengths of the AC/PCL composites and pure PCL. Overall, the AC/PCL composites showed high initial cell adhesion after 4 h of cell culture and increased cell proliferation compared to those of PCL composites used as a control. Based on these tests, an AC of 10.7 wt% was determined to be the optimal composition for the AC/PCL composite. Thus, these composites can be used in various 3D printing material applications in tissue engineering.",

    "abstract": "The heterogeneity of natural rocks produces increased variations in the results of geomechanical and metallurgical tests making the repeatability of experimental work questionable. Fabricated test specimens have, therefore, become more attractive for fundamental studies. In this study, quasi-identical 3D-printed (3DP) specimens with 10 and 16 mm diameters were fabricated and tested to study material strength and understand the breakage characteristics at a scale more suitable for comminution. Cylinder specimens composed of quartz (named Si) and iron oxide (named Fe), with sorted grains of ∼100-150 μm in the form of homogeneous specimens (3DP-Si and 3DP-Fe) and heterogeneous specimens (bedded) (3DP-SiFeSi, 3DP-SiFe, and 3DP-FeSiFe) were tested. This article presents the results for experimental Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) and Brazilian Tensile Strength (BTS) tests. The elastic property was obtained from the UCS tests, while tensile strength was obtained from BTS tests. The strength of 3DP specimens of similar diameter decreases following the types: 3DP-Si (most competent), 3DP-Si-Fe, 3DP-SiFeSi, 3DP-FeSiFe, and 3DP-Fe (less competent). The results show that heterogeneous 3DP specimens were influenced by bedding angle, thickness, and mineral group composition. It also seems that the sequence of mineral composition and the number of beds play a role, rather than the overall grain percentage area for each cylinder, in influencing the strength and variability of fragments. Finally, the brittleness indices for 3DP specimens were calculated as a function of UCS and BTS.",

    "abstract": "Large bone defects caused by congenital deformities and acquired accidents are increasing day by day. A large number of patients mainly rely on artificial bone for repair. However, artificial bone cannot fully imitate the structure and composition of human bone, resulting in a large gap with autologous bone function. Therefore, this article proposes a continuous preparation method for inorganic/organic biphasic composite gradient biomimetic bulk bone scaffolds. First, a controllable gradient hybrid forming platform for inorganic/organic dual-phase biomaterials was constructed, and the feeding control strategy was studied to achieve precise control of the feeding of sodium alginate/gelatin composite organic materials and hydroxyapatite inorganic materials. The speed is, respectively, sent from the corresponding feeding nozzle to the mixing chamber to realize the uniform mixing of the biphasic material and the extrusion of the composite material, and the inorganic/organic biphasic composite gradient biomimetic bone scaffold with gradual structure and composition is prepared. Second, to prove the superiority of the preparation method, the physicochemical and biological properties of the prepared scaffolds were evaluated. The test results showed that the morphological characteristics of the biphasic composite gradient bone scaffold showed good microscopic porosity and the structure and composition showed gradients. The mechanical properties are close to that of human bone tissue and in vitro cell experiments show that the scaffold has good biocompatibility and bioactivity. In conclusion, this article provides a new type of bone scaffold preparation technology and equipment for the field of tissue engineering, which has research value and application prospects.",

    "abstract": "Due to their amorphous structure, metallic glasses exhibit remarkable properties such as high strength, hardness, and elastic strain limit. Conversely, they also exhibit high susceptibility to brittle fracture, making them less qualified for the use as monolithic structural components. Therefore, they may be preferably used as the reinforcing phase in hybrid materials combined with ductile matrix materials. Especially metal matrix composites with interpenetrating structures are suitable. This requires an open-porous structure of the metallic glass. In the study at hand, an open-porous lattice structure was manufactured from metallic glass powder (Ni60Nb20Ta20) by laser powder bed fusion. A parameter study was carried out with various scanning strategies to manufacture a mechanically stable lattice structure while maintaining the amorphous structure of the metallic glass. Thus, X-ray diffraction measurements were conducted to validate the parameter study. A stable lattice structure with a largely amorphous structure was successfully achieved with a scanning strategy of single scanned lines and a rotation of 90° for each layer. However, nanocrystallization of 7% occurred in the heat-affected zones formed between the individual printed layers during reheating. Conducting compression tests, a compressive modulus of 18 GPa and a maximum strength of 90 MPa in 0°-direction were achieved. In 90°-direction, no compressive modulus could be determined but compressive strength resulted in 15 MPa. Performing nanoindentation with a Young's modulus of 195.1 GPa and Vickers hardness of HVIT = 956.1 was achieved for the printed bulk metallic glass alloy. The resulting lattice structure was further characterized by differential scanning calorimetry for thermal behavior.",

Poly-ɛ-caprolactone (PCL) combined with ceramics such as hydroxyapatite (HA), β-tricalcium phosphate (TCP), and bioglass 45S5 were successfully mixed using a melt blending method and fabricated with the use of screw-assisted extrusion-based additive manufacturing system.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to investigate the morphology of cells on the surface of bone bricks, whereas energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy was used to investigate the element composition on the surface of the bone bricks. Confocal imaging was used to investigate the number of differentiated cells on the surface of bone bricks. Proliferation results showed that bone bricks containing PCL/HA content are presenting higher proliferation properties, whereas differentiation results showed that bone bricks containing PCL/Bioglass 45S5 are presenting higher differentiation properties. Confocal imaging results showed that bone bricks containing PCL/Bioglass 45S5 are presenting a higher number of differentiated cells on their surface compared with the other material contents.",

    "abstract": "The rise of additive manufacturing, particularly laser powder bed fusion, has enabled new degrees of freedom in terms of design and functionality. Notably high-performance industries such as the medical, automotive, and aerospace industries are on the edge of broad industrial application. However, the quality standards required for these industries are not yet entirely met. Process-related temperature-induced residual stresses within the component can lead to warpage and deformations causing rejects. Support structures are a vital counter measure to absorb these residual stresses and ensure the required print quality. While the current industrial standard for support structure generation mainly focuses on geometrical boundary conditions, this study presents a simulation-based approach taking into account residual stresses. The proposed approach determines the stress distribution during the process from a thermomechanical finite element process simulation and uses these results for the allocation of topology-optimized stackable unit cells. To assure a reliable connection to the component while offering easy removability of the support, different connection support structures in the interface area were tested and integrated in the proposed approach. The result is a robust tailored lattice support structure minimizing residual stresses to achieve high component quality, while focusing on cost-efficiency factors such as minimal material usage, easy support removability, and numerical efficiency. Finally, the proposed approach was tested on a demonstrator part printed from AlSi10Mg.",

    "abstract": "The powder bed fusion (PBF) process is a metal additive manufacturing process, which can build parts with any complexity from a wide range of metallic materials. PBF process research has predominantly focused on the impact of only a few parameters on product properties due to the lack of a systematic approach for predictive modeling of a large set of process parameters simultaneously. The pivotal challenges regarding this process require a quantitative approach for mapping the material properties and process parameters onto the ultimate quality; this will then enable the optimization of those parameters. In this study, we propose a two-phase framework for studying the process parameters and developing a predictive model for 316L stainless steel material. We also discuss the correlation between process parameters that is, laser specifications and mechanical properties, and how to obtain an optimum range of volumetric energy density for producing parts with high density (>99%), as well as better ultimate mechanical properties. In this article, we introduce and test an innovative approach for developing AM predictive models, with a relatively low error percentage (i.e., around 10%), which are used for process parameter selection in accordance with user or manufacturer part performance requirements. These models are based on techniques such as support vector regression, random forest regression, and neural network. It is shown that the intelligent selection of process parameters using these models can achieve a high density of up to 99.31% with uniform microstructure, which improves hardness, impact strength, and other mechanical properties.",

    "abstract": "To overcome the material processing challenges induced by high levels of heat input in wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM), an innovative WAAM method using pulsed arc plasma (PAP-WAAM), was developed by the authors in the previous study. In this method, the PAP generated by the pulsed voltage was used as the heat source. The pulse interval can be defined as the time interval between adjacent pulse voltages, which determines the ignition time and frequency of the arc plasma, thus influencing the forming process. However, the effect of pulse interval on the forming process has not yet been revealed. Here, the effects of pulse interval on forming process during the PAP-WAAM of Ti6Al4V, including thermal behavior, arc plasma characteristics, and metal transfer process, were investigated by experiments and simulation. The results exhibited that the interpass temperature and maximum peak temperature decrease with increasing pulse interval at the same arc plasma power, indicating an alleviation of heat accumulation along the building direction. As the pulse interval increased, the ignition mode of the arc plasma changed from ignition between the tungsten electrode and the previously deposited layer to ignition between the tungsten electrode and filler wire, which increased the proportion of discharge energy allocated to the filler wire, thus reducing the overall heat input required for material deposition. When the pulse interval was 300 and 400 ms, only the uninterrupted bridging transfer mode was observed during the deposition process. The uninterrupted bridging transfer is considered to contribute to forming a smooth and consistent layer appearance. In addition, longer pulse intervals resulted in less surface oxidation, narrower wall thickness, and better macrostructure, attributed to reduced heat input and improved effective heat dissipation. This research reveals the effect of pulse interval on forming process during PAP-WAAM, which benefits the fabrication of desirable metal parts.",

    "abstract": "Cork-based formulations adapted to binder jetting processes were herein developed and investigated. Two cork powder sets with different particle size distributions were studied to evaluate cork particles' ability to pack. Cork powders exhibiting a coarse distribution revealed a higher packing ability. In addition, owing to cork's lower affinity to water-based binders, the addition of two hydrophilic additives was explored. 3D-printed (3DP) cork parts with a simple geometry were first printed. An innovative technique was evaluated as a postprocessing phase to improve cork particle adhesion after printing. Inspired by the production of expanded cork agglomerates, use of autoclave technique as a postprocessing phase for cork parts was proposed. After the autoclave, 3DP parts exhibited an improved adhesion of cork particles, demonstrated by morphological and mechanical analyses. Fourier transform infra-red analyses demonstrated that the polysaccharide and suberinic fractions were also affected by the autoclave. 3DP cork parts with a complex design solution were successfully printed. This study contributes to new and complex design solutions for cork-based products maintaining cork's natural lightness, warmness, and softness to the touch.",

    "abstract": "The fused deposition modeling (FDM) form of additive manufacturing provides a low-cost opportunity to quickly create unique parts with complex geometries using a high degree of precision. This is accomplished through a layer-by-layer extrusion of a metallic infused thermoplastic from a heated nozzle onto a build plate, until the 3D part is achieved. The ability to produce cheaply manufactured FDM printed cast iron parts would allow industries to bypass casting lead times and create custom cast iron parts without a machined mold. However, there has been minimal research into FDM printing of cast iron and the corresponding effects of printing parameters. The current study aims to determine the acceptable printing parameter ranges for FDM printed cast iron. The effects of three printing parameters (flow rate, infill density, and layer height) were studied with regard to the porosity, shrinkage, mass, and volume of the FDM printed cast iron. A flow rate range of 145-185% was determined to provide good-quality print while an infill density in the range of 100-125% for most flow rates provided acceptable print quality. Furthermore, the layer height was determined to have no significant effect on the printed part. Regarding the effect of printing parameters on the shrinkage, mass, and volume of the FDM printed part, the study showed that increasing the flow rate and infill density resulted in reduced shrinkage and a higher relative sintered mass and volume. Additionally, increasing the layer height showed an insignificant change in the sintered mass, volume, and shrinkage. Sintered samples obtained densities ranging between 5.02 and 5.44 g/cc and porosity measurements from 7.14% to 18.85%. This is one of the first studies on the FDM printing of cast iron. The results would enable researchers and hobbyists to successfully print their first cast iron part.",

Based on the traditional two-dimensional reentrant honeycomb structure, a modified three-dimensional (3D) reentrant lattice structure with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) is proposed. The studies on fabrication and design parameters are conducted, leading to a new understanding of the effects of these parameters on the printing quality and mechanical properties of such lattice structure with reentrant diagonal struts. Additive manufacturing (AM), specifically laser powder bed fusion, is used to fabricate five groups of 18Ni350 Maraging Steel samples with different geometric and printing parameters. The compression test is conducted to obtain the effects of NPR on the quasi-static stress-strain relationship of the proposed structure. The results show that smaller hatch distance and scan speed for 3D printing process can lead to less porosity level and more complete printing, resulting in larger stiffness and yield strength of the structure. The preferred AM process variables to improve structural quality with thin angled struts (diameter ≤0.5 mm) are presented. Moreover, with the help of the tuned finite element model based on experimental results, parametric analysis is conducted to confirm the effect of design parameters, including reentrant angle, strut cross-section shape, and size, on the compressive properties of the structure.",

It is also notorious for the hundreds of different process variables, which often are overlooked in favor of parameters considered to be more relevant for mechanical performance, such as printing and bed temperatures, printing speed, and layer height. Thus, this study is aimed at evaluating some of the less frequently studied process variables, namely raster orientation angles (and their stacking sequence) and feeding rate. Based on this, the influence of these variables on the tensile and flexural properties of short carbon fiber-reinforced polyamide printed by FFF was assessed. The study concluded that stacking layers with raster angles of 0°/90° and +30°/−30° resulted in the best trade-off between tensile and bending properties, with the former reaching ultimate tensile and flexural strengths of 111 ± 1 and 137 ± 5 MPa, respectively. The study also found that there was no increase in part density or mechanical properties when the volumetric flow was increased up to 120% of the intended road volume. Therefore, the hypothesis that an increase in flow rate would result in less inter-road gaps could not be confirmed with the current setup.",

To date, the effects of processing parameters on crack formation are still not well understood. The purpose of this study is to understand the correlation between the thermal cycle and the hot cracking during LPBF of Al-Cu-Mg-Mn alloys. In this study, we performed a detailed microstructural and morphogical characterization of molten pool to explain the initiation, propagation, and arrest of hot cracking. Thin wall, single layer, and cubic samples with different processing parameters were selected for an in-depth study of thermal cycling. Under the action of single vertical thermal cycling, the solidification crack at the center of the molten pool will heal, but the solidification cracks at the boundary of the molten pool still exist. Under the action of single horizontal thermal cycling, the initiation point and propagation path of solidification cracks are formed at the overlap zone of molten pool. However, under the alternating action of horizontal and vertical thermal cycles, the crack would not disappear, but would always exist and propagate through the multilayer. Adjusting the processing parameters, which could provide preheating, increase the amount of liquid phase, reduce the residual stress, extend the lifetime of the molten pool, and refine the grain size will decrease the hot cracking susceptibility of LPBFed Al-Cu-Mg-Mn alloys.",

More importantly, the slicing and tool path information can be tracked all the time during optimization to facilitate the evaluation of the tool path-related material constitutive model, for example, the fiber-reinforced composites, so as to improve the numerical analysis accuracy and the design result optimality.

    "abstract": "The evolution of rapid solution-based deposition and 3D printing has promoted the exploitation of a number of forces to produce micro- and nanoscale-printed conductive materials that can be used for electrical connections and device electrodes, among other things. Electrohydrodynamic jet (e-jet) printing affords the opportunity to create nano-scale features with heterogeneous inks that can integrate metallic, polymer, and biological components. Though the resistivity of these printed metallic forms has continued to improve and approaches bulk resistivity in many cases, the adaptability to print vertical layers by using these deposition methodologies is lacking. Through the use of a fabricated heated vacuum chuck e-jet printing system, a two-stage curing process has been developed wherein a vertical layering of silver is demonstrated, with resultant resistivity (5.238 ± 1.650 μΩ-cm) approaching that of bulk silver (1.59 μΩ-cm). Both these stages are required to reduce the resistivity to this point, as the first stage rapidly evaporates ink solvents and the second sinters the nanoparticles. This process is necessary regardless of the substrate used, which is interrogated further by using the flexible, transparent plastic polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The resistivity of the deposited silver film is dependent on the temperatures used during each curing stage, though the optimization of the second (sintering) stage was the determining factor in long-lasting silver films due to PET's glass transition range. The impact that this “hard-curing” temperature has on long-lasting films was examined, resulting in an optimized two-stage curing process using 51.4°C and 230°C in respective stages. This optimization led to the demonstration of the 3D printing abilities of the developed printing system, by showing the difference between two deposition methods, producing lines that are four times as high as they are wide, and highlighting the potential that this system holds in 3D electronics fabrication.",

    "abstract": "There is in-depth understanding of the effects and interactions of various process parameters on the mechanical properties and dimensional accuracy of parts produced through fused filament fabrication (FFF). Surprisingly, local cooling in FFF has been largely overlooked and is only rudimentarily implemented. It is, however, a decisive element of the thermal conditions governing the FFF process and of particular importance when processing high-temperature polymers such as polyether ether ketone (PEEK). This study, therefore, proposes an innovative local cooling strategy, which allows for feature-specific local cooling (FLoC). This is enabled by a newly developed hardware in combination with a G-code postprocessing script. The system was implemented on a commercially available FFF printer and its potential was demonstrated by addressing typical drawbacks of the FFF process. Specifically, with FLoC, the conflicting requirements for optimal tensile strength versus optimal dimensional accuracy could be balanced. Indeed, feature-specific (i.e., perimeter vs. infill) control of thermal conditions resulted in a significant increase in ultimate tensile strength and in strain at failure in upright printed PEEK tensile bars compared with those manufactured with constant local cooling—without sacrificing the dimensional accuracy. Furthermore, to improve the surface quality of downward-facing structures the controlled introduction of predetermined breaking points at feature-specific part/support interfaces was demonstrated. The findings of this study prove the importance and capabilities of the new advanced local cooling system in high-temperature FFF and provide further directions on the process development of FFF in general.",

In particular, the influence of humidity on mechanical properties was analyzed in detail. The prepared composite filaments were printed into hollow dodecahedrons and presented in this study. Therefore, the composites had great properties and might be expected to put into practical applications of 3DP technology.",

    "abstract": "Photopolymerization-based ceramic 3D printing shows unmatched superiority in fabricating high-performance ceramic parts compared with the conventional preparation technology. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to achieve efficient 3D printing due to the light scattering in photosensitive ceramic slurries, increasing the width of solidification and reducing the curing depth during photocuring. Herein, we report an efficient ceramic 3D printing approach based on curcuminoid dye-sensitized photopolymerization under green light-emitting diode (LED). For deep penetration and minimal light scattering, ceramic bodies with good performance can be produced from a ceramic slurry with curcuminoid dye by using a green LED-digital light processing (DLP) 3D printer. Curcuminoid dye was found to provide the ability to transfer electrons to photoinitiator and play a role in improving the accuracy of the entire 3D printing process. The proposed approach here provides a viable solution toward efficient ceramic additive manufacturing by green LED-DLP-3D printing.",

One postprocessing method, a self-terminating etching process (STEP), can improve the surface finish of parts up to 76%, but the resulting effects on fatigue life and corrosion reliability remain unknown. This work evaluates the effect of the STEP on the fatigue and corrosion performance of L-PBF 316L. In addition, to determine the influence of changing the microstructures from the as-built condition, specimens having undergone a pre-STEP stress relief (SR + STEP) heat treatment and a pre-STEP solution anneal (SA + STEP) were evaluated. The results showed that a pre-STEP SR resulted in the best Sa roughness, while a pre-STEP SA had the biggest improvement in Sv roughness. Despite Sv roughness being a major indicator of fatigue performance, the coarse grains and internal porosity in the SA specimens resulted in the poorest fatigue performance. The SR + STEP specimens' fatigue lives were 10 × higher than the AP samples under a load of 275 MPa and 2–3 × higher under a 350 MPa load. The SR + STEP specimen also had the best corrosion performance in a sodium chloride electrolyte due to the smoother surface and least remnant surface carbides.",

    "abstract": "Numerical modeling of additive manufacturing processes is often conducted to predict both thermal and mechanical effects such as distortions, residual stresses, and phase distributions. The prediction accuracy is highly dependent on an accurate representation of thermal field, especially heat sources. In this study, response surface methodology (RSM) is serially utilized and mutually mapped to understand the relationships between process parameters and heat source coefficients. First, the effects of process factors and heat source model coefficients on experimental and numerical bead geometry are, respectively, identified through analysis of variance on central composite designs. With influences mathematically quantified, heat source coefficients in accordance with experimental conditions are inversely solved using nonlinear least square method, followed by correlation with process factors. The results show that both the effects of process parameters and heat source coefficients on bead geometry characteristics can be modeled using quadratic polynomials. The connections between heat source coefficients and process variables can also be modeled using quadratic or lower polynomial functions with good accuracy. It is proven that the proposed RSM mapping method is feasible for heat process correlation. The research outcome provides a convenient and reliable method of heat source calibration for laser additive manufacturing.",

    "abstract": "Finite element analysis (FEA) of fused deposition modeling (FDM) has recently been recognized in additive manufacturing (AM) for predictions in temperature and displacement. These predictions can be invaluable for making corrections to the printing process to improve quality of printed components. However, FEA has limitations that discourage manufacturers from using it. For example, the fine mesh model takes considerably long computational times (although it yields more accurate results than those of a coarse mesh model). In this work, an innovative deep learning (DL)-based super-resolution (SR) approach is proposed to improve the result accuracy of a coarse mesh model to the higher accuracy level of a fine mesh model and reduce the computational time. The element in the FEA is treated as the physical pixel in an image, so the grid from fine mesh model and coarse mesh model in the FEA is analogous to high resolution (HR) images and low resolution (LR) images, respectively. The results show that the difference value ErrorHS between HR and reconstructed SR is much lower than the difference value ErrorHL between HR and interpolated LR, which demonstrate that our modified super resolution residual network SR reconstruction algorithm is effective to improve the interpolated LR in temperature and displacement. In addition, both the increased peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) value and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) value indicated that the quality of both temperature and displacement images is improved through the learned SR model. In addition, the results confirm that mapping between fine mesh model and coarse mesh model in a temperature field is varied from the one in displacement field.",

    "abstract": "In this research, the design and implementation of a novel chopped fiber deposition system for the laser sintering (LS) process is discussed. The system allows deposition of chopped fibers with different lengths and of multiple fiber types in a commercial LS machine. A weight percentage of 5% (2 vol%) glass fibers can be implemented without disturbing the LS process. LS specimens both with and without fibers can be produced during the same job as the setup only deposits fibers on half the powder bed. This is to reach an in-depth understanding of the influence of fibers on the produced specimens as the comparison can be made with the matrix material built in the same job. The setup was developed to answer the increasing demand for additively manufactured polymer composites with optimized mechanical properties currently manifesting in industries such as aerospace, biomedical, and automotive. To reach successful stress transfer from fiber to polymer, fibers need to have a certain critical length dependent on the combination of fiber and matrix material. For most material combinations, this length is longer than what is obtained with the fillers reported in literature. The development of the deposition system successfully allows the deposition of chopped fibers with longer lengths (to reach successful stress transfer) during the LS process, overcoming previously reported difficulties. The setup consists of six main components and can be connected to the recoating roller or blade present in every LS machine. With a test sieve, the vibrating system and a four-blade mixer are the most important for the functioning of the system. After preliminary testing, a profound optimization of the setup was conducted after which LS specimens with chopped fibers were successfully produced. X-ray computed tomography imaging of the produced specimens with fibers, showed a successful integration of chopped fibers in different random directions throughout the layers.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale extrusion-based additive manufacturing (AM) has emerged as a potential alternative for construction, addressing the challenges associated with the high carbon footprint of the building industry. Although AM enables the creation of intricate design geometries through controlled material deposition, providing innovative solution strategies for design construction, large-scale 3D printed structures are limited to a single homogeneous material, such as cement or clay, and their functionality is restricted to load-bearing formwork. Although still at a nascent stage for building construction, multimaterial additive manufacturing (MMAM) has emerged as a promising technology for the industry to overcome this limitation and reduce the embodied carbon of 3D printed structures by limiting the use of structural materials through topology optimization strategies. MMAM enables the fabrication of functionally graded materials (FGMs) by controlling the extrusion ratio between two or more distinct materials, resulting in building envelopes with multiple performance characteristics and functions. While research has focused on improving the structural performance of 3D-printed envelopes through MMAM, limited attention has been given to optimizing thermal performance and energy efficiency. An increasing interest in thermal energy storage technologies for buildings using the latent heat storage capacity of microencapsulated phase change materials (mPCMs) is related to the advantages of improving energy efficiency using materials that can absorb, store, and release heat when their temperature changes. To this end, this study proposes an FGM design-to-construction methodology for large-scale structures that optimizes the thermal performance of 3D-printed envelopes by locally tuning the distribution of heterogeneous mixes of clay and mPCMs during the AM process. The results of the digital simulations and physical tests show that the local optimization of mPCM and clay within the wall thickness according to the specific temperature differential can provide annual energy reductions compared with a homogeneously printed envelope without embedded mPCM.",

This study integrates MICP with nonplanar granular 3D printing methods, overcoming casting limitations such as geometrical constraints and uneven calcification, enabling the creation of thin, porous structures with an increased surface, which is beneficial for biocementation. Our approach combines computational design, microbial techniques, and digital fabrication, presenting biocemented prototypes demonstrating Sporosarcina pasteurii's ability to achieve natural calcification in printed systems.

    "abstract": "The growing environmental impacts of solid waste accumulation have resulted in an increased demand for biodegradable alternatives to conventional plastics. While several products have begun to gain popularity as biodegradable or compostable plastics, these often still negatively impact terrestrial and aquatic environments, as they frequently require precise conditions in order to fully decompose. Furthermore, standards for measuring biodegradation rates are often complex and poorly representative of real disposal sites, limiting their widespread use and applicability. In this study, we present four simple tests to assess the environmental degradability of materials without specialized equipment and demonstrate them with a series of 3D printable biotic composites composed of pectin, chitosan, and cellulose, abundant and organic biopolymers known to be degradable by common microorganisms. Five different compositions were degraded in live soil, worm burial, high humidity, and aqueous environments, and demonstrated rapid degradation with up to 100% mass loss after 21 days for a pectin-based material buried in worm-laden oil. Degradability was further found to be tunable, with decreasing degradation rate as chitosan content increased. Our results confirm that biotic composites degrade more rapidly than conventional plastics and provide accessible methods that can enable more widespread material testing for the development of sustainable material alternatives, especially to gather basic environmental degradation information representative of typical solid waste discard conditions. We anticipate that these degradation methods and the materials degraded therein will provide further impetus for reducing waste from 3D printing and for considering end of life when designing products.",

    "abstract": "Vat photopolymerization is characterized by its high precision and efficiency, making it a highly promising technique in ceramic additive manufacturing. However, the process faces a significant challenge in the form of recoating defects, necessitating real-time monitoring to maintain process stability. This article presents a defect detection method that leverages multi-image fusion and deep learning for identifying recoating defects in ceramic additive manufacturing. In the image fusion process, multiple single-channel recoating images captured by monitoring camera positioned near the photopolymerization equipment are merged with curing area mask image to create a three-channel color image. The recoating images suffer from perspective distortion due to their side view. To facilitate fusion with the curing area image, image rectification technique is applied to correct the perspective distortion, transforming the side view recoating images into a top-down view. Subsequently, the fused images are processed using a channel-wise YOLO (You Only Look Once, CW-YOLO) method to extract features, enabling the distinction of various types of defects. When compared with other deep learning models, CW-YOLO achieves higher detection accuracy while maintaining a detection rate of 103.58fps, meeting the requirements for real-time detection. Furthermore, the paper introduces the F1 score as a comprehensive evaluation metric, capturing both detection accuracy and recall rate. The results show that the F1 score is enhanced by approximately 10% after image fusion, demonstrating that the proposed method can significantly improve defect detection, particularly in cases involving difficult-to-distinguish defects like material shortages and scratches.",

    "abstract": "3D-printed earth materials that incorporate natural raw soils have been recently emerging due to their ecological and affordability potential. However, earth materials applications in additive manufacturing have been limited to thick mass assemblies with little to no fiber reinforcement. The addition of natural plant fibers within earth-based mixtures may advantageously increase ductility while allowing for lightweight assembly types, such as thin and perforated elements. This article presents a novel research development on natural, raw, and untreated earth-fiber compositions with maximized wheat straw fiber content for 3D-printed lightweight architectural tiling applications. Initiated with an experimental printability apparatus of a range of mix designs, a printable \"light straw clay\" mixture is defined through extrudability and buildability tests. Then, combining the digital craft of weaving with natural fibers for earthen lightweight artifacts, a geometric analysis explores potential super lightweight and structurally sound tessellations to allow for minimum material in the production of perforated panels. The third phase of the research included structural bending tests to assess the number of layers required for the final tile production. Finally, the resulting 3D-printed modular components were assembled to create a lightweight installation, hung and exhibited with an interplay of light and shade. By maximizing co-product vegetable fiber content within an earthen and bio-based paste, this research aims to increase the carbon storage capabilities of digital earth construction while enhancing its lightness and tensile possibilities. Learning from vernacular \"recipes\" of natural earth- and fiber-based construction, the developed paper-thin partition assemblage presented in this article contributes to wider possibilities of natural, nonconventional, and radically low-carbon material systems and geometries in digital fabrication.",

    "abstract": "Imagine a world in which architecture will be 3D printed from living materials. That buildings will germinate, bloom, wither, produce new kinds of materials, and return back to the soil. This article introduces an innovative approach to sustainable architecture, through the utilization of 3D-printed structures crafted from locally sourced soil and plant seeds. After printing, the seeds germinate over time, forming load-bearing designs with interwoven root systems, which exhibit remarkable strength and resilience, reducing reliance on conventional construction materials. The research evaluates the mechanical properties of 3D-printed living structures through a set of material experiments to find a material combination that will allow maximum growth within 3D-printed architectural scale objects. The successful pilot project demonstrated their strength and capacity to support plant growth. The study also addresses the esthetic, cultural, and social dimensions of this novel fabrication technique, offering personalized, native plant-based patterns, and fostering community engagement. In conclusion, this research underscores the transformative potential of 3D-printed root-built structures as a sustainable architectural solution. By harnessing local soil and plant roots, these living constructions offer an eco-friendly alternative to conventional materials, with diverse environmental and social benefits. This study contributes to the evolving knowledge base of eco-conscious building practices, encouraging further exploration and adoption of nature-based solutions in architecture. With ongoing development, root-built buildings hold the promise of revolutionizing design, construction, and habitation, promoting a harmonious coexistence between humans and the natural environment.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) models are essential for visualization and conceptual understanding of complex architectures such as protein structure. Although there is a plethora of software platforms that allow digital depictions of protein structure at an atomic level in silico, physical models are needed to convey an intuitive understanding of biomolecular architecture. However, it is a challenge to represent all the relevant features of proteins in a single physical model due to their sheer structural complexity. Here, we describe a modular protein model that focuses only on representation of the secondary structure—the underlying structural skeleton. The simplified model consists of amino acid units, which can be linked together to reproduce the two most fundamental structural features of protein secondary structure: the relative positions of the amino acid alpha carbon atoms, and the intra-main chain hydrogen bonding pattern. We use 3D printing and magnets to create a set of three modular amino acid building blocks, which when linked together into a chain, can faithfully represent alpha helices, beta sheets, and turns. These simple to make models can be used to quickly assemble the alpha carbon trace of an entire protein domain, which conveys a tactile experience of the complexity of protein skeletal architecture. These models highlight the modularity of protein structure: where a single structural unit, the amino acid, can be linked together to form a larger, regular secondary structure. These models also have a propensity to spontaneously organize into alpha helices and beta sheets, as demonstrated by their ability to autonomously assemble when placed in a circulating water tank. These models provide a missing educational tool to expand knowledge of protein structure, foster deeper insight into protein folding, and inspire greater interest in biomacromolecular architecture.",

In this article, we report a simulation-based methodology to design heat treatment IN718 in a laser metal deposition (LMD) process by using Thermo-calc. Initially, the finite element modeling simulates the laser melt pool to compute the solidification rate (G) and temperature gradient (R). Then, the primary dendrite arm spacing (PDAS) is computed through Kurz-Fisher and Trivedi modeling integrated with finite element method (FEM) solver. Later, a DICTRA homogenization model based on the PDAS input values computes the homogenization heat treatment time and temperature. The simulated time scales are verified for two different experiments with contrast laser parameters and are found to be in good agreement confirmed with the results from scanning electron microscopy. Finally, a methodology for integrating the process parameter with the heat treatment design is developed, and a heat treatment map for IN718 is generated that can be integrated with an FEM solver for the first time in the LMD process.",

The actual hormones, especially estrogens, have shown to be one of the major contributors to hormonal waste in wastewater. Wastewater treatment facilities have variable capabilities to handle hormonal compounds and, therefore, different quantities of harmful compounds may end up in the environment. We introduce a simple technique to remove estrogens, such as 17β-estradiol (E2) from wastewater by using 3D printed polyamide-12 (PA12) filters. A selective laser sintering 3D printing was used to manufacture porous PA12 filters with accessible functional groups. Adsorption and desorption properties were studied using gas chromatography with flame ionization detector. The results showed that near quantitative removal of E2 was achieved. The 3D printed filters could also be regenerated and reused without losing their efficiency. During regeneration, E2 could be extracted from the filter without destroying the compound. This opens up possibilities to use the hormone scavenger filters also as concentration tools enabling accurate analyses of sources with trace concentrations of E2.",

With advances in printer resolution, the etching of sacrificial materials from increasingly smaller channels is poised to be a bottleneck using the existing techniques. In this study, we introduce a microfabrication approach that utilizes centrifugation to effortlessly and efficiently remove the sacrificial materials from 3D-printed microfluidic devices with densely packed microfeatures. We characterize the process by measuring the etch rate under different centrifugal forces and developed a theoretical model to estimate process parameters for a given geometry. The effect of the device layout on the centrifugal etching process is also investigated. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach on devices fabricated using inkjet 3D printing and stereolithography. Finally, the advantages of the introduced approach over commonly used injection-based etching of sacrificial material are experimentally demonstrated in direct comparisons. A robust method to postprocess additively manufactured geometries composed of intricate microfluidic channels can help utilize both the large printing volume and high spatial resolution afforded by 3D printing in creating a variety of devices ranging from scaffolds to large-scale microfluidic assays.",

    "abstract": "Spatially varying material properties allow the dynamic response of structural systems to be almost arbitrarily tailored, far beyond the first or fundamental natural frequency. Continuing advances in manufacturing technology are making it possible to achieve the necessary range of stiffness and density variations, but the design of these property distributions is a challenging task because of the complex multidimensional nature of the problem. Generative design methods based on evolutionary optimization algorithms have been successfully used to obtain solutions based on multi-material distributions. However, the applicability of these solutions is limited by their reliance on multi-material additive manufacturing (AM), which currently only offers digitally mixed acrylic polymer options that are generally unsuitable to produce functional parts. A novel structured material solution is proposed here, in which the problem domain is divided into several volume elements (voxels), each of which contains a structure whose geometrical form is altered to adjust its effective properties to desired values. The single material structural solution will be amenable for ready fabrication by the powder-based selective laser sintering and melting processes with real engineering polymer and metal systems, thereby allowing for the realization of the benefits in real-world applications. The resulting continuous design spaces are searched using a modern evolutionary algorithm, the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES). A MATLAB implementation of this evolutionary design method, in conjunction with finite element simulations for fitness evaluation, showed good convergence for several different cantilever beam test cases when tested against several different sets of target natural frequencies. Correlations with the multi-material solutions show that the single structured material approach is on par or even better in some cases, even though the test domain was discretized into 80% fewer voxels than for the multi-material case. Furthermore, the voxel structures can be realized using current AM technologies.",

    "abstract": "Support removal is one of the thorny issues faced by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). In particular, the efficient and safe removal of support structures from the thin-walled parts and obtaining high-quality surfaces still remains a challenge owing to their sensitivity to machining. An in-depth understanding of the material response behavior of LPBF thin-walled parts when removing support structures is necessary for overcoming this challenge. The work is divided into two parts: revealing the support removal mechanism and proposing a solution to improve the support machinability. First, the machinability of support structures on thin-walled parts with different thicknesses at different cutting depths was thoroughly investigated. Experimental investigation on cutting force, surface morphology, and deflection were carried out. The results show that cutting forces increase gradually at each cut owing to the tilt and collapse of support structures. The surface morphology is improved as the sample thickness increases but deteriorated as the cutting depth increases. Second, a novel solution of adding resin is proposed to improve the support machinability and good results have been achieved. The z-direction cutting forces for 0.3 and 0.4 mm thickness samples are reduced by 72.6% and 64.6%, respectively, and no deflection of the sample is observed after support removal. Moreover, finite element method simulations are established to further explain the support removal mechanism.",

A vacuum infusion (VI) mold was printed from fiberglass-acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and evaluated for wear and suitability for small VI runs. The mold was designed to accentuate high wear as a \"worst case\" scenario. The mold was able to produce 10 parts successfully before any noticeable change occurred to the surface finish. By 14 parts, the surface finish had roughened sufficiently that demolding was difficult and resulted in damage to the part. Profilometry measurements showed a 7 × increase in roughness over the run. No significant tool wear or change in geometry was detected. Even longer life would be expected for typical tooling designs since the test mold was deliberately designed to accentuate wear and demolding issues. Based on these results, similar FGF molds are a feasible option for short run VI production for prototyping or low-volume composites manufacturing, possibly at lower cost and quicker turnaround time than machined aluminum molds.",

    "abstract": "Adsorption is considered to be one of the most effective and economically viable technologies for removing contaminants from the environment. However, the disadvantages of its high-cost complicated process and difficulty in efficient recycling limit its practical application. Herein, a thermoplastic elastomer-polyvinyl alcohol composite (LAY-FOMM 60) sponge three-dimensional structure (3D printing sponge) was fabricated by the fused filament fabrication combined with water erosion technique. The size and shape of the resultant sponge were tailored, and the batch of adsorption/desorption experiments of Rhodamine B (RhB) onto the sponge was performed. The results show that the adsorption of RhB on the 3D printing sponge was mainly via physical adsorption, and pseudo-second-order and Langmuir models exhibited good correlation with the adsorption kinetic and isotherm data, respectively. Thermodynamic parameters suggest that the adsorption is an endothermic and spontaneous process. It is worth to note that the adsorption/desorption efficiency can be raised by compression. This results in high efficiency and low cost for adsorption/desorption process and benefit for regeneration of the adsorbent. The adsorption capacity was maintained over 85% of the initial capacity after being used for five cycles. The approach provides a simple strategy for manufacturing customizable porous adsorbent materials that meet various water treatment requirements.",

    "abstract": "Among a variety of additive manufacturing technologies, constrained-surface image-projection-based stereolithography (SLA) technology has unique advantages in printing precision and commercial maturity. For the constrained-surface SLA process, separating the cured layer from the constrained surface is a crucial step that enables the fabrication of the current layer to accomplish. The separation process limits the accuracy of vertical printing and affects the reliability of fabricating. To reduce the separation force, current existing methods include coating nonsticky film, tilting the tank, sliding the tank, and vibrating the constrained glass. Compared with the above methods, the rotation-assisted separation method presented in this article has the advantages of simple structure and inexpensive equipment. The results of the simulation show that the pulling separation with rotating can reduce the separation force and shorten the separation time effectively. Besides, the timing of rotating is also crucial. A customized rotatable resin tank is used in the commercial liquid crystal display-based three-dimensional printer to reduce the separation force by breaking the vacuum environment between the cured layer and the fluorinated ethylene propylene film in advance. The analyzed results have demonstrated that this method can reduce the maximum separation force and the ultimate separation distance, and the reduction is related to the edge profile of the pattern.",

Considering the experimental cost and data measurement in oil recovery research, laboratory oil recovery is the most effective method. The rock core model used in the simulation directly affects whether the research results are credible. However, the current three-dimensional rock core model manufacturing methods and corresponding models lack of reproducible, customizable, and visualized characteristics. In this study, a reproducible rock core model of microsphere accumulation based on the structure of natural rock core was designed and manufactured by microstereolithography. Oil recovery experiments and simulation studies show that the rock core model has similar flow characteristics to natural rock cores. In addition, resin rock core models with different structures and hydrogel rock core models with deformability are also manufactured by microstereolithography and used for simulation analysis. This research provides an effective and reproducible rock core structure model for the experiment of oil recovery research.",

Photofatigue resistance, mechanical property, microtopography, and thermal analyses of 3D printed samples were performed. The results showed that the difference in surface color of composites improved by 26.7% with addition of AH after 10 days of accelerated aging, whereas the mechanical strength decreased.

Additively manufactured tools made of plastic could reduce manufacturing costs and represent an alternative to conventionally manufactured tools for prototype applications as well as enabling small series with the injection molding process. The aim of this article was to examine additively manufactured injection molding tools; to determine their potential in terms of service life, surface quality, and production time; and to link them with the production costs so that the profitability can be assessed. Therefore, a reference component and an injection mold have been designed. To test the capabilities of different 3D printing techniques and materials, three molds have been produced by fused filament fabrication (FFF), one by PolyJet process, one by digital light processing, and for a direct comparison to conventional methods, one mold has been milled from aluminum. All molds have been tested in two series. First, they were used under the same conditions over a period of 100 injection molding cycles. Based on the knowledge obtained and an additional profitability analysis, three forms could be identified as promising. Two of these forms could be further investigated in a second series of tests. Based on all experiments, the technical feasibility of additively manufactured injection molds for small batch production could be confirmed. It could be evaluated that each manufacturing process and every material has some advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, temperature-resistant thermoplastics can be processed with FFF, which can withstand service lives of more than 150 cycles without any signs of wear and are therefore suitable for small series. On the other hand, the PolyJet process achieves good surface qualities and short production times, which means that it can be used for prototype applications.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) is a burgeoning technology for fabricating complex components with high efficiency and low material waste. However, the surface of AM parts is rough owing to partially melted powders and severe surface fluctuation. Electrochemical machining (ECM) is a suitable postprocessing method to finish the surface of the AM parts, and the low current density is usually employed. Our study illustrates the electrochemical dissolution characteristics of the horizontal and vertical sections of the AM SUS 304 component under a low current density and the electrochemical finishing process to obtain smooth surfaces. Linear and fan-shaped melt pools are observed on the horizontal and vertical sections, respectively. Moreover, the melt pool boundaries are vulnerable to dissolution and separate the hollows, basins, and swellings formed after electrochemical dissolution. The two sections display similar current efficiency and polarization because of the single austenitic phase and the identical and uniform elemental content distribution. The top and side surfaces of the AM sample could be efficiently smoothened via ECM by eliminating the partially melted powders and significantly reducing the surface roughness. The numerous band humps make the top surface of the AM sample difficult to smoothen compared with the side surface under the point effect of the electric field.",

The unclear complex quality characteristics has been an obstacle of nondestructive testing of additive manufacturing (AM) AlSi10Mg, especially at its as-built state. This article attempts to reveal the quality characteristics of as-built AM aeronautical AlSi10Mg based on its conductivity characteristics. Experimental results show that the quality of manufacturing is nonuniform. The nonuniformity of each sample surface is systematically evaluated. Along the building direction, the quality is best in the initial few layers and decreases as the built height increases. On this basis, a reference curve is obtained and used to describe the quality characteristics of as-built AM component along the building direction. Based on the quality characteristics, the inspection of small offsets caused by accidental failures during the manufacturing process is carried out. The offsets not <37 μm are detected with the help of the reference curve, whereas they are not discovered by the radiography testing. It proves that the proposed method of offset inspection is highly sensitive.",

It is a combination of neural network (NN) techniques and finite element simulation (FES) that allows designing each parameter of a piezoelectric ejection system faster and more reliably than conventional methods. Using experimental and literature data, a FE model of the droplet ejection process was developed and validated to predict two indexes of droplet ejection behavior (DEB): jetting velocity and droplet diameter. Two artificial neural network (ANN) models based on feed-forward back propagation were developed and optimized by genetic algorithm (GA). A database was established by FE calculations, and the models were trained to establish the relationship between the piezoelectric ejection system design input parameters and each DEB indicator. The results show that both NN models can independently predict the droplet jetting velocity and droplet diameter values from the training and testing data with high accuracy to determine the optimal piezoelectric ejection system design. Finally, the accuracy of the prediction results of the FES and ANN-GA models was verified experimentally. It was found that the errors between the predicted and experimental results were 4.48% and 3.18% for the jetting velocity and droplet diameter, respectively, verifying that the optimization method is reliable and robust for piezoelectric ejection system design optimization.",

A novel manufacturing method was developed to generate scalable hierarchical structures in concrete. The new method used 3D-printed microscaffolds to interact with the multiscale particle packing in concrete, resulting in a structured lightweight composite material. The size of internal members can vary by more than two orders of magnitude, to adapt to different applications. Based on compression tests and microstructural investigation by optical microscope and quantitative nanomechanical mapping, we found that the new material is 63.93% more efficient in energy absorption capacity compared with traditional lightweight concrete. Our experimental trials also showed that introducing structural hierarchy can reduce the consumption of cementitious material in the system by up to 14% and significantly reduce the use of scaffolds. The method could be applied to a board spectrum of multiscale particle-based materials, such as dental cement and bone implant materials, to improve material performance and efficiency in medical and construction applications.",

    "abstract": "While targeted alignment in certain additive manufacturing (AM) methods such as material extrusion (MEX) and stereolithography (SLA) has been well documented in the research community, a method for targeted alignment of added fillers or fibrous materials in powder bed fusion (PBF) AM devices has yet to be successfully achieved. Similarly, incorporation of multimaterials does not work easily with any of the AM technologies. This study creates a prototype design that could be integrated into a PBF system to allow for multimaterial layer deposition and alignment of powders and powder blends. The rheological properties of polyamide powder and a range of polyamide composite blends (incorporating milled carbon fibre, graphite flakes, polytetrafluoroethylene, and glass microspheres) in different concentrations were studied, and together with the particle size distribution and particle morphology analysis were applied for the design of a prototype hopper for incorporation in the PBF system to create targeted multimaterial deposition. Different concept designs, multichambered and multi-hopper with hopper angles calculated specifically for the composite blend powders selected, were proposed. Initial deposition trials outside a PBF process were tested, and the deposited layers were measured.",

    "abstract": "Polymers are widely used in healthcare due to their biocompatibility and mechanical properties; however, the use of polymers in medical products can promote biofilm formation, which can be a source of hospital-acquired infections. Due to this, there is a rising demand for inherently antimicrobial polymers for devices in contact with patients. 3D printing as a manufacturing technology has increased exponentially in recent years. Surgical guides, orthotics, and prosthetics, among other medical devices, created by vat polymerization have been used in hospitals to treat patients. Biocompatible resins are available for these applications, but there is a lack of antimicrobial resins, which would further improve the technology for clinical use. The focus of this study was to assess settling of candidate antimicrobial metal and metal oxide fillers in vat polymerization resin to determine which fillers were compatible with the resin. Dispersion stability was assessed by measuring settling over the maximum print duration of the medium priced desktop 3D printers to evaluate printability of 17 potentially antimicrobial resins. Eight materials displayed settling behavior during the test period: molybdenum oxide, zirconium oxide nanopowder, scandium oxide, zirconium oxide, titanium oxide, tungsten oxide, lanthanum oxide, and magnesium oxide. No settling was observed for manganese oxide, magnesium oxide nanopowder, titanium oxide nanopowder, copper oxide, silver oxide, zinc oxide nanopowder, zinc oxide, silver nanopowder, and gold nanopowder during the test period. This method could be applied to assess settling of other fillers introduced into 3D printing resins before actual printing.",

In this study, a paraffine-based composite was used to substitute melt-cast explosives, and a Design of Experiments approach based on central composite design was adopted to investigate the influence of layer thickness, percent infill, extrusion temperature, and printing velocity on the roughness of printed samples. The results showed that layer thickness and printing velocity could significantly influence the roughness of printed specimens, and no obvious voids or cracks inside the specimens can be detected in computed tomography. In addition, a composite-shaped grain was successfully fabricated via the EAM-D-1 printer, which proved the feasibility of 3D printing melt-cast explosives with complex structures.

Voxel printing, where users assign materials to voxels, has allowed for the further expansion of design possibilities by tuning the properties of the jetted material. This study aims to investigate how different compositions of uniformly distributed Vero and Agilus voxels affect the thermomechanical properties of the voxel-printed part. In addition, high stiffness Vero droplets surrounded by a soft matrix of Agilus resemble polymer composites, thus calling for the examination of percolation, which is an important phenomenon in polymer composites. The study explores the presence of percolation in voxel-printed mixtures of Vero and Agilus and its impact on mechanical properties.

In this article, small punch test (SPT) method is used to study the mechanical properties of SLM-manufactured GH4169 over a wide temperature range from 25°C to 600°C. With the increase of temperature, the decreasing ratio of maximum load is only 18.75% from 25°C to 600°C, and the yield load fluctuates with temperature, proving that it maintains the excellent load-bearing ability at high temperature. From the variation law of the normalized SPT fracture energy versus temperature, the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature of SLM-manufactured GH4169 is 413.63°C indicating the change of fracture mechanism. Moreover, the \"fish scale\" printed layer near the fracture surface changes from the difficult deformed microstructure to significant deformed one, leading to the variation of the fracture mechanism from brittle cleavage fracture traversing the printed layers to ductile fracture along the printed layers. This article reveals the variations of strength parameters, fracture energy, and fracture mechanism with temperature for SLM-manufactured GH4169 over a wide temperature range, which provides basic data for its application at different temperatures.",

By performing standard image acquisition of 3D printed objects that are not limited to materials and sampling locations, the surface shape and texture details of the objects can be accurately reconstructed using this method, independent of ambient light, with high robustness. Compared with the conventional multifrequency method, the required projection pattern is reduced from 12 to 9 and the overall measurement efficiency is improved by 25%, while maintaining the advantages of the independent pixel calculation method of the multifrequency method. In addition, the effectiveness of the method is experimentally verified by complex surface reconstruction experiments and plaster model experiments, which provide accurate measurement accuracy with high efficiency and precision.

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) techniques have the potential to produce complex parts, and many of these techniques require the use of support structures to prevent deformations and to minimize thermal effects during the printing process, particularly when building overhangs and internal cavities. However, removing the support structures through postprocessing incurs additional costs and time penalties. Unlike other AM techniques, support structures are not used in directed energy deposition (DED) technique due to its working principle. Therefore, special multiaxis complex path-planning strategies for DED are adopted to print relatively simple overhang geometries. Nevertheless, printing internal channels using this technique can still be challenging or nearly impossible. In this work, a novel DED process using graphite as a support material is proposed for additively manufacturing simple and complex internal channels. The support material is easily removed without requiring extensive machining processes. The results demonstrated that the support material did not negatively impact part quality, and in fact, the presence of different carbides at the interaction zone increased hardness and Young's modulus. Moreover, there were no cracks and or porosity at the support material-part interface. This study is the first of its kind to demonstrate the potential for using graphite as a support material for DED processes in additively manufacturing parts with complex internal channels and overhangs and highlights the need for further research in this area.",

This article proposes a microstructure scanning electron microscope (SEM) mapping modeling and numerical mean procedure to calculate the effective stiffness of FDM printing PLA/CF laminates. The printed PLA/CF parts were modeled as a continuum of 3D uniform linear elasticity with orthotropic anisotropy, and their elastic behavior was characterized by orthotropic constitutive relations. Micromechanical models of two typical deposition configurations, 0° unidirectional aligned configuration and 0°/90° angle-ply configuration of the printed parts were established based on the periodic representative volume element (RVE) technique. The elastic constants of the RVE models were estimated by volume average method in the finite element stress analysis, and the effects of deposition configurations, CF length, and content on the effective stiffness were also investigated. The results show that the effective stiffness of FDM printing PLA/CF composite is closely related to CF length, content, and the deposition configuration. With the increase of CF length and content, the Young's modulus and shear modulus of printed PLA/CF parts increase, whereas Poisson's ratio decreases. The printed PLA/CF parts with 0° unidirectional aligned configuration exhibits orthotropic characteristics, and the maximum Young's modulus appears along the first axis. The 0°/90° angle-ply FDM PLA/CF composite exhibits transverse isotropic characteristics and the lowest Young's modulus is found along the thickness direction.",

To solve these issues, in this article, we propose a cross-sectional contour extraction algorithm based on computed tomography (CT) scan data to nondestructively detect the size deviation of micromixers generated by AM. Herein, we take a square wave micromixer and a three-dimensional (3D) circular micromixer as examples to characterize the size deviation. We reconstruct the surface model of the micromixer from CT scan data, which is referred to as the reconstructed model, and extract the central axis of the micromixer reconstructed model. Subsequently, a dividing plane perpendicular to the central axis is established, which is then used to cut the reconstructed model to obtain the cross-sectional contour of the channel. Finally, size inspection is conducted on the extracted cross-sectional contour. The standard deviations of the channel width and height for the square wave micromixer are 0.0271 and 0.0175, respectively, and those for the 3D circular micromixer are 0.0122 and 0.0144, respectively. Through uncertainty analysis, the errors calculated based on the design size are −1.70%, +0.48%, +0.23%, −1.86%, −5.23%, and −0.90%, respectively, which shows that this method can meet the needs of measurement.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study is to create a multiscale highly porous poly (ether-ether-ketone) (PEEK) structure while maintaining mechanical performance; the distribution of pores being generated by the manufacturing process combined with a porogen leaching operation. Salt at 70 wt% concentration was used as a porogen in a dry blend with PEEK powder sintered in the powder bed fusion process. The printed porous PEEK structures were examined and evaluated by scanning electron microscopy, microcomputed tomography, and mechanical testing. The PEEK structures incorporating 70 wt% salt achieved 79-86% porosity, a compressive yield strength of 4.1 MPa, and a yield strain of ∼60%. Due to the salt leaching process, the PEEK porous frameworks were fabricated without the need to drastically reduce the process parameters (defined by the energy density [ED]), hence maintaining the structural integrity and good mechanical performance. The compression results highlighted that the performance is influenced by the printing orientation, level of the PEEK particle coalescence (controlled here by the ED), pore/cell wall thickness, and subsequently, the overall porosity framework. The porous printed PEEK structures could find potential uses in a wide range of applications from tissue engineering, filtration and separation to catalysts, drug release, and gas storage.",

The effects of the spatial arrangement on the microstructure, mechanical properties, and surface roughness of the parts were investigated. Both the normal and floating builds exhibited an α+β lamellar microstructure, but the normal builds had finer grains compared to the floating builds. The microstructural characteristics were correlated with the thermal history, specifically the cooling rate, resulting from the connection plate (S45C for the normal builds and the powder bed for the floating builds). The compressive yield strength and hardness of the normal builds were higher than those of the floating builds, regardless of build location owing to the grain refinement effects on the normal builds. The top surface (TS) of the sample was smoothest, and the lateral surface of the sample was the roughest for both the normal and floating builds; however, the roughness of the TS and bottom surface samples did not differ significantly between normal and floating builds. There were no noticeable differences in the microstructure and mechanical properties of the builds in five different positions, that is, the center and four corners. Finally, these findings were used to develop a set of conceptual spatial arrangement designs, including floating builds, to optimize the microstructure and mechanical properties.",

By this approach, simple 3D patterns such as multilayer circles, squares, and walls have been printed using two polymer melts with different rheological properties, high-temperature polylactic acid and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene.

    "abstract": "Microcantilever structures such as microgears play an important role in precision mechanisms, where highly accurate cantilever characteristics guarantee the reliable function of these structures. Projection-based stereolithography (PSL) technology is widely used to fabricate sophisticated microstructures owing to its high precision and remarkable efficiency, and plenty of works have been done to improve the precision of structures with macroscale. However, the shape accuracy of microcantilever structures fabricated through PSL process is always neglected, which severely hinders its application in precision mechanisms. In this work, we investigated the influence of major factors on the shape accuracy of microcantilever structures in PSL process through orthogonal tests. Different resin materials were tested to investigate the influence of material properties. Printing experiments showed that for a given PSL system, microcantilever structures with confined size could be directly and accurately manufactured using a set of optimized processing parameters, which dramatically speed up the production process and effectively improved the reliability of microcantilevers. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of the capability of PSL to fabricate microcantilever structures and guides the manufacturing processes of micromechanisms with cantilever features, which effectually promotes the industrial application of PSL technology.",

    "abstract": "Facing the rapid development of 6G communication, long-wave infrared metasurface and biomimetic microfluidics, the performance requirements for microsystems based on metal tiny structures are gradually increasing. As one of powerful methods for fabrication metal complex microstructures, localized electrochemical deposition microadditive manufacturing technology can fabricate copper metal micro overhanging structures without masks and supporting materials. In this study, the role of the microprobe cantilever (MC) in localized electrodeposition was studied. The MC can be used for precise deposition with electrolyte localized transport function and high accuracy force-displacement sensitivity. To prove this, the electrolyte flow was simulated when the MC was in bending or normal state. The simulation results can indicate the influence of turbulent flow on the electrolyte flow velocity and the pressure at the end of the pyramid. The results show that the internal flow velocity increased by 8.9% in the bending probe as compared with normal. Besides, this study analyzed the force-potential sensitivity characteristics of the MC. Using the deformation of the MC as an intermediate variable, the model of the probe tip displacement caused by the growth of the deposit and the voltage value displayed by the photodetector was mathematically established. In addition, the deposition of a single voxel was simulated by simulation process with the simulated height of 520 nm for one voxel, and the coincidence of simulation and experimental results was 93.1%. In conclusion, this method provides a new way for localized electrodeposition of complex microstructures.",

The improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is applied to avoid falling into local optimum. Furthermore, we combine optimization for unloading with our previous work, which is in terms of support structure reduction. The unloading condition has been transformed into the calculation of added support structure owning to the process improvement, so that the optimized model with minimum support structure can be unloaded successfully.

However, the complexity of the structure and unsupported printing process are major challenges for path planning of extrusion process. This article presents a method to plan and control the path for extruding 3D spatial wireframes by synthesizing dynamic material behaviors such as heat deformation, plasticity, and bending, during the curing process as active contributors to the printed form. With this method, a novel system of printing spatial wireframe model is developed that disassociate the extruding path and extruded form by dimensional, that is, printing a 3D spatial wireframe with a 2D printing path. The workflow of the research combines robotic/mechanical automation with machine vision and artificial intelligence, to generate material models without any preexisting knowledge of the material. Based on the feedback loop between machine vision and printing control, this system is capable of automatically conducting material experiments at a large scale, observe the results, and learn to generate an end-to-end solution that directly bridges the design intention to the fabrication of spatial wireframes based on nonstandard material behaviors. The development of the method allows designers to design and fabricate dynamic spatial frames, without the support of existing material and structural models.",

A stable colloidal dispersion of spinel in polymer-water solution was prepared and 3D-printed using a 30-gauge needle (∼100 μm inner diameter) on a regenHU 3D-Discovery bioprinter. Samples were characterized for their density and microstructure. Samples with near theoretical density after HIPing was subjected to mechanical property evaluation such as hardness by Vickers indentation and elastic modulus using nanoindentation technique. Microstructure of sintered samples across the ribs have shown graded grain structure with finer grains near the edges (0.7 μm average) with occasional porosity and coarser grains toward the center of the rib (5.2 μm average). HIPing resulted in substantial grain growth and the average grain size was found to be 10.9 μm (with a variation in the grain size of 2.2 μm along the edges and 13.1 μm at the center of the rib) exhibiting close packed and dense microstructure. Finer grains toward the edges may probably be due to the flow behavior during printing process and lower distribution of the powder loading along the edges resulting in low green density. This relatively higher porosity pining the grain growth under the extremely low heating rate employed for the controlled shrinkage to maintain the integrity of the sample. 3D printed samples after HIPing exhibited a density of 3.57 g/cc and hardness of 12.95 GPa, which are at par with the samples processed through conventional ceramic processing techniques. Nanoindentation studies employing maximum load of 45 mN with depth have shown an elastic modulus of 238 ± 15 GPa. MgAl2O4 spinel mesh 3D printed in this study is a potential prospective candidate that can be explored for cranioplasty procedures and other biomedical applications.",

Although there exists substantial diversity in mechanisms of gripping, there still exists a lack of consistency, accuracy, and efficacy in positioning very large numbers of milli-, micro-, and nano-scale objects. We demonstrate the use of parallel electro-osmotic grippers to selectively transport multiple millimeter-sized voxels simultaneously. In contrast to previous research focused on using arrays of droplets to grab a single substrate, each element in the array is individually controlled via capillary effects, which are, in turn, controlled by an electric field to create predetermined patterns of droplets to pick and place selected objects. The demonstrated fluidic pick-and-place method has two key advantages: It is suitable for transport of fragile and complex objects due to the lack of mechanical contact, and it easily parallelizes to arbitrary array sizes for massively parallel pick-and-place. This work demonstrates a 25-element parallel assembly of 1.5-mm spheres with 95–98% grasping reliability, in a variety of geometric patterns. Experimental performance was validated against both analytical and computational models. The results suggest that electro-osmotic droplet arrays may enable the additive manufacturing of multi-material objects containing millions of components in the same print bed.",

    "abstract": "The aerospace industry consistently prioritizes researching optimization methods for reducing component weight, meeting structural and thermal requirements, and enhancing product quality and efficiency. This work explores a design method that combines topology optimization (TO) and lattice generation to redesign three components: a jet engine bracket, an airplane bearing bracket, and an optical instrument mounting structure to satisfy their various structural and thermal loading requirements. Redesign and optimization methods for aircraft components such as jet engines and airplane bearing brackets have led to promising results, however, these components only have structural loading requirements. Spacecraft components such as mounting structures for optical instruments are needed for any space observation mission. Due to launch loads and the harsh space environment, they experience multiphysics loading requirements, including extreme stiffness for optical pointing precision, thermal resistance, and structural stability. The combination of loads and constraints poses challenges for the sole utilization of a single method or tool for optimizing mounting structures. Although TO and lattice generation methods are commonly used to create lightweight and optimized designs, each method has its limitations. Highly topology-optimized components may fail at unexpected loads, and many lattice generation methods are limited in controlling their geometric parameters. Combining these two methods would aid in balancing their respective shortcomings, leading to an effectively optimized component. In this study, TO software is coupled with a unique bubble-mesh-based lattice generation method that allows for variation in the following three parameters: cell size/lattice density, strut intersection rounding, and strut diameter. This coupled design process led to final designs that met the essential loading requirements of each component with the following weight reductions: mounting structure: 81.8%, jet engine bracket: 62.4%, and airplane bearing bracket: 52.5%.",

    "abstract": "The advent of three-dimensional (3D) printing technology changed modern manufacturing in many different ways. 3D printed parts based on the fused deposition method (FDM) are widely used in many different applications. However, parts made from polymer-based filaments are generally not strong enough to meet engineering needs. Today, plastic filaments reinforced with carbon fibers and carbon nanotubes are also available in the market to be used in FDM-based 3D printers. Whether reinforcing regular plastic filaments with carbon fibers or carbon nanotubes improves mechanical properties of 3D printed parts is a big question. The purpose of the current research is to investigate the mechanical properties of 3D-printed specimens from these composite filaments. Tensile testing was carried out on a set of 3D-printed specimens made from ABS, PLA, carbon fiber-reinforced ABS, carbon fiber-reinforced PLA, and nanotube-reinforced ABS filaments. The specimens for testing were designed according to ASTM guidelines. A small tensile testing machine with a real-time data acquisition system was used for testing and collecting data. For each material, the test was carried out multiple times. The results showed that for a given material the standard deviation is very small indicating high repeatability of the data. Statistical analysis using Student-t distribution shows that the modulus of elasticity for the reinforced filaments was higher than their nonreinforced counterparts.",

    "abstract": "A conformal microstrip antenna is highly integrated with the carrier profile, giving it the advantage of reduced carrier space. However, the processing technology for fabricating an antenna with a conformal surface is complicated and expensive owing to its irregular shape. Therefore, it is particularly important to find ways to reduce the difficulty in producing conformal conductive patterns. For the production of conformal microstrip antennas, a five-axes motion printing system is proposed to print conductive patterns on nonexpanded surfaces. The conductive pattern uses a new boundary-alignment-optimization algorithm in the printing process to improve the accuracy of the boundary of the conductive pattern by optimizing the ink-dropping points in the motion command. The short-time and low-temperature sintering of the conductive pattern by using a flash light enables it to exhibit conductive properties. This method is practically implemented to fabricate a conformal array microstrip antenna. The main and side lobes of the electric and magnetic fields in the directional pattern measured in the microwave darkroom have the same trend as in the simulation diagram. Thus, the effectiveness of this method was verified through simulation analysis and experimental results.",

    "abstract": "This article presents the results of monotonic tensile and fatigue tests conducted on commercial polylactide or polylactic acid (PLA). The results of fatigue tests for this material present in the literature are limited, especially for additive manufactured elements. The specimens were manufactured using the injection molding and the fused filament fabrication (FFF) method. The FFF specimens were divided into five subgroups, depending on the direction of filament deposition and infill density. The achieved results are aimed to verify the selected experimental method of fatigue testing of materials used in the additive manufacturing technology. It was considered an important issue, since there is no standard practice for fatigue testing of FFF- manufactured polymers, and research reported in the literature is usually obtained for a small number of specimens. In this work, over 20 specimens per S-N curve were used, which enables to classify them as reliability data type according to ASTM E 739 standard. It has been shown that the resultant fatigue lives can be related with applied nominal stress amplitudes using the classical S-N curve, described with Basquin-type power law function. This is evidenced, among the others, by the very similar scatter of results for both manufacturing technologies and the similar slopes of S-N curves. Some similar conclusions are hard to find in other works. The achieved results can also provide knowledge regarding the differences of monotonic and fatigue behavior of PLA, which is a commonly used biodegradable polymer, with respect to the technology of specimen's manufacturing method. They can be useful in the development of biodegradable implants and other devices used in tissue or biomedical engineering. It has been shown that, to some extent, the fatigue testing of FFF-manufactured parts can be performed in the similar way as parts manufactured by injection molding.",

In this study, a novel 3D printing technology is applied that combines ultraviolet (UV) curing with paste extrusion. This hybrid manufacturing technique enables the fabrication of complex geometries from high filler-ratio pastes. The developed biocomposite aims for suitable mechanical properties in terms of tensile and compressive strength. It is composed of acrylic acid, cellulose acetate, α-cellulose, and fumed silica with a cellulose ratio of more than 25 vol-%. The material is extruded with an in-house-developed 3D printer equipped with a 12 W UV light curing source, which enables concurrent curing and extrusion. Two different UV-curing strategies were tested: postcuring without concurrent curing and postcuring with concurrent curing. The total UV-curing duration was kept constant with all samples. Tensile testing in accordance with ASTM standard D638-14 Type 4, compression testing according to ASTM D695-15, and overhang tests were conducted. As a result, samples without notable shrinkage, suitable tensile strength (up to 17.72 MPa), competitive compression testing parameters (up to 19.73 MPa), and an enhanced overhang angle (increase of more than 25°) were produced, leading to new applications and more freedom in design due to higher possible unsupported overhangs when using UV-curing during the print. Overall, constant UV light radiation during the print leads to improved mechanical properties due to the possibility of bypassing the UV-penetration depth constraint. It should be considered when extruding photopolymer-based composites, especially for large and complex components with a low degree of translucency.",

Here, we present a robotic system that is capable of maskless layerwise photopolymerization on curved surfaces, enabling production of large-area conformal patterns and the construction of conformal freeform objects. The system comprises an industrial six-axis robot and a custom-built maskless projector end effector. Use of the system involves creating a mesh representation of the freeform substrate, generation of a triangulated toolpath with curved layers that represents the target object to be printed, precision mounting of the substrate in the robot workspace, and robotic photopatterning of the target object by coordinated motion of the robot and substrate. We demonstrate printing of conformal photopatterns on spheres of various sizes, and construction of miniature three-dimensional objects on spheres without requiring support features. Improvement of the motion accuracy and development of freeform toolpaths would enable construction of polymer objects that surpass the size and support structure constraints imparted by traditional SLA systems.",

These films create a polymerization inhibition zone that facilitates continuous printing in the additive mode of fabrication. Typically, oxygen-permeable films made out of Teflon are currently used. These films are expensive and are not commonly available. Hence, this research work investigates the feasibility of using commonly available low-cost oxygen-permeable films made from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and polyurethane for continuous additive manufacturing. We also characterize the ablation depth range that can be achieved using these films and the potential use for subtractive ablation-based manufacturing as well as hybrid additive/subtractive manufacturing. Results demonstrate that the PDMS films (600 μm thick) can be used for both additive and subtractive modes, whereas spin-coated PDMS thin film (40 μm thick) on glass coverslip and breathe-easy polyurethane film (20 μm thick) laminated on glass coverslip are suitable only for additive mode of fabrication. The latter two films are oxygen impermeable, however, they retain oxygen, which is capable of creating dead zone and thereby facilitates continuous printing. We anticipate that this work will help researchers to choose the appropriate oxygen-permeable film for continuous additive, subtractive, and hybrid additive/subtractive manufacturing of complex three-dimensional structures for a range of applications.",

    "abstract": "Lightweight bioinspired structures are extremely interesting in industrial applications for their known advantages, especially when Additive Manufacturing technologies are used. Lattices are composed of axial elements called ligaments: several unit cells are repeated in three directions to form bodies. However, their inherent structure complexity leads to several problems when lattices need to be designed or numerically simulated. The computational power needed to capture the overall component is extremely high. For this reason, some alternative methodologies called homogenization methods were developed in the literature. However, following these approaches, the designers do not have a local visual overview of the lattice behavior, especially at the ligament level. For this reason, an alternative mono-dimensional (1D) modeling approach, called lattice-to-1D is proposed in this work. This method approximates the ligament element with its beam axis, uses the real material characteristics, and gives the cross-sectional information directly to the solver. Several linear elastic simulations, involving both stretching and bending dominated unit cells, are performed to compare this approach with other alternatives in the literature. The results show a comparable agreement of the 1D simulations compared with homogenization methods for real tridimensional (3D) objects, with a dramatic decrease of computational power needed for a 3D analysis of the whole body.",

The resulting willow filament and composite material are characterized for structural capacity and fabrication constraints.

When combined with three-dimensional (3D) printing capabilities, complex 3D structures can be produced, from ultrafine fibers in the absence of toxic solvents, making it particularly attractive to fabricate customized scaffolds and implants for medical applications. This research aimed to develop novel less stiff vaginal mesh implants for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) repair, matching the physiological biomechanics of vaginal tissues. The main objectives, to attain that goal, were: development of a melt electrospinning writing prototype, with additive manufacturing capability, to produce complex structures from micrometer scale fibers, in a direct 3D printing mode; and design and validate new concepts of biodegradable meshes/scaffolds with new geometries, for POP repair. The melt electrospinning writing prototype was built based on different modules. Biodegradable polycaprolactone was used to produce novel implants: three geometries and two fiber configurations were employed. The commercially available Restorelle® (Coloplast) mesh was used as a benchmark. Printed implants were analyzed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and uniaxial tensile testing. The SEM images showed that the geometry is generally well produced; however, some minor deviations are visible due to charge interactions. The tensile test results indicated that, regardless of the geometry, the samples showed an elastic behavior for smaller displacements; aplastic behavior dominates later stages. In the physiological range of deformation, the novel meshes (80 μm fiber diameter) matched the tissue properties (p > 0.05). The Restorelle mesh was significantly stiffer than vaginal tissue (p < 0.05) and novel meshes. The precision of the various geometrical patterns and fiber diameters produced highlights the success of the designed and built prototype equipment. Results showed that the biodegradable meshes produced are biomechanically more compatible with native tissue than commercial implants.",

Despite this need for an AM-skilled workforce, little research has systematically investigated the formulation of educational interventions for training engineers in DfAM. In this article, we synthesize findings from our experiments with 596 engineering design students to inform the development of educational interventions—comprising content presentations and design tasks—that encourage student learning and creativity. Specifically, we investigated the effects of four variations of DfAM educational interventions by manipulating the following: (1) the content of DfAM information presented, (2) the order of presenting the DfAM content, (3) the definition of the AM design task, and (4) the competitive structure of the AM design task. The effects of these variations were experimentally tested by comparing changes in students' DfAM self-efficacy and the creativity of students' design outcomes. Validated measures were also developed as part of our studies to help mature the nascent field of DfAM education. Based on the findings of our experiments, we discuss how task-based educational interventions can be formulated to (1) increase students' DfAM self-efficacy, (2) encourage students to generate ideas of high AM technical goodness, and (3) encourage students to generate more creative ideas when using AM. The novel synthesis of our findings in this article will help educators formulate effective DfAM educational interventions and tasks to foster a workforce skilled in DfAM.",

    "abstract": "Lattice structures are a type of lightweight structure that is more commonly being applied to engineering systems as a way to reduce mass and enhance mechanical properties. The cantilever beam case is one of the primary modes of loading in many engineering applications, where light-weighting is also crucial. However, lightweight lattice structured cantilever beams have not been investigated considerably due to design and manufacturing limitations. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the response of four different lattice structured cantilever beams comprising of unit cells made from Schwarz-P, Schwarz-D, Gyroid, and Octet-truss structures fabricated using Multi Jet Fusion additive manufacturing technology. An investigation into the cross-sections of these structures leads to a conclusion that the beams made from such structures are non-prismatic in nature as a result of variation in cross-sections. This led to the development of equations for the moment of inertia of these structures, which helped in calculating symmetric and un-symmetric bending. These beams were subjected to cantilever loading until failure, which provided insights into flexural properties such as flexural stress, stiffness, and strain energy. Experimental results indicate that the surface-based structures, due to better surface-area-to-volume ratio, have better ability in transferring loads and hence perform better than the beam-based Octet-truss beam. The Schwarz-D beam had performed the best among all the beams, which is further supported in literature due to its stretch-dominated topology that results in higher values of modulus. The finite element analysis (FEA) findings also validate these findings in which the distribution of stresses can be seen to be better transmitted than the other structures. The FEA validation shows that the distribution of Von-Mises stress and their position in experimental tests and failure of these structures is also very close, which provides validation to the experimental setup and the testing of beams.",

    "abstract": "Wounds are skin tissue damage due to trauma. Many factors inhibit the wound healing phase (hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and alteration), such as oxygenation, contamination/infection, age, effects of injury, sex hormones, stress, diabetes, obesity, drugs, alcoholism, smoking, nutrition, hemostasis, debridement, and closing time. Cellulose is the most abundant biopolymer in nature which is promising as the main matrix of wound dressings because of its good structure and mechanical stability, moisturizes the area around the wound, absorbs excess exudate, can form elastic gels with the characteristics of bio-responsiveness, biocompatibility, low toxicity, biodegradability, and structural similarity with the extracellular matrix (ECM). The addition of active ingredients as a model drug helps accelerate wound healing through antimicrobial and antioxidant mechanisms. Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting technology can print cellulose as a bioink to produce wound dressings with complex structures mimicking ECM. The 3D printed cellulose-based wound dressings are a promising application in modern wound care. This article reviews the use of 3D printed cellulose as an ideal wound dressing and their properties, including mechanical properties, permeability aspect, absorption ability, ability to retain and provide moisture, biodegradation, antimicrobial property, and biocompatibility. The applications of 3D printed cellulose in the management of chronic wounds, burns, and painful wounds are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "4D printing technology refers to the manufacturing of products using 3D printing techniques that are capable of changing shape or structure in response to external stimuli. Compared with traditional 3D printing, the additional dimension is manifested in the time dimension. Facilitated by the advancement of magnetic smart materials and 3D printing technology, magnetically controlled 4D printing technology has a wide range of application prospects in many fields such as medical treatment, electronic flexible devices, and industrial manufacturing. Magnetically controlled 4D printing technology is a new scientific research field in the 21st century, which includes but is not limited to the following disciplines: mechanics, materials, dynamics, physics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism. It involves many fields and needs to be summarized systematically. First, this article introduces various magnetic intelligent materials, which are suitable for magnetically controlled 4D printing, and discusses their programmability. Second, regarding the printing process, the article introduces how to preset the material distribution as well as the research progress about the optimization of magnetically controlled 4D printing platforms and the distribution of magnetic field profiles. Third, the article also makes a brief introduction to the applications of magnetically controlled 4D printing technology in medical, electronic flexible devices, and industrial manufacturing fields.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) printing holds tremendous potential as a tool for patient-specific devices. This proof-of-concept study demonstrated the feasibility, antimicrobial properties, and computed tomography (CT) imaging characteristics of iodine/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) 3D meshes and stents. Under scanning electron microscopy, cross-linked PVA displays smoother and more compacted filament arrangements. X-ray and transaxial CT images of iodized PVA vascular stents show excellent visibility and significantly higher Hounsfield units of radiopacity than control prints. Three-dimensional PVA prints stabilized by glutaraldehyde cross-linking and loaded with iodine through sublimation significantly suppressed Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus growth in human blood agar disk diffusion assays.

    "abstract": "As the multibillion dollar additive manufacturing (AM) industry continues to evolve, a growing number of companies have adopted 3D printing to produce finished goods. Yet recent research suggests that AM has barely begun to achieve its potential market; estimates on current penetration range from just 1% to 10%. It is not surprising that executives are having difficulty; the technology has many second-order effects on business operations and economics. Three factors—technology, awareness, and organizational readiness—contribute to adoption rates. A recent McKinsey & Company survey of leading manufacturers highlights a general lack of awareness of AM's applications and value. Interestingly, 40% of the respondents were unfamiliar with the technology “beyond press coverage,” and an additional 12% of respondents indicated that AM “might be relevant but [they] needed to learn more about the technology.” In essence, more than half of the market has yet to grasp AM's applications. Once this pent-up potential is unlocked, companies will face organizational challenges that require new management processes, alignment across business units, proactive executive champions, and fresh employee capabilities. To drive the conversation forward, executives must examine AM's potential benefits and identify the steps their companies should take to ensure organizational readiness.",

    "abstract": "Fused deposition modeling (FDM) has a staircase effect (as inherent process characteristics), which results in rough surface of the final components (usually of polymer-based materials such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene [ABS]). This is one of the major limitations of this process, which hinders the use of this technique in precision industrial applications such as assembly parts and investment casting. Hot vapor smoothing (HVS) is one of the commercial techniques available for the improvement of surface finish of the FDM-based components. However, the reflow of the material by application of HVS may affect the surface hardness, tensile strength, and other mechanical properties of ABS parts. In the present study, surface hardness of ABS components has been improved through the HVS process by using acetone as smoothening media. Parts with different shapes and at different densities of FDM system were prepared at 0° orientation. Design of experimentation has been employed for optimization of input process parameters (namely geometry of the components/appliance, density of components/appliance, and acetone exposure time) in response to surface hardness of the parts. The scanning electron microscopic-based characterization of the components was carried out for justification of the surface hardness data.",

A mixture of sucrose sugar and corn syrup is proposed as an analogous substitution material for research in molten material fed three-dimensional (3D) printing. Molten sugar is optically transparent and it exhibits similar temperature–viscosity relationship and solidification properties as molten glass, but at a much lower temperature (100–150°C). A low cost, desktop size 3D printer is designed with a temperature controlled sugar reservoir made from easily obtainable parts. The process of printing with molten sugar is demonstrated with success in recreating objects with similar complexity to glass prints.

    "abstract": "This article proposes a support diminution design method for layered manufacturing of manifold surface based on variable orientation tracking (VOT). We aim at reducing the external support or upholders to a minimum with maximum possibility theoretically to save material and diminish material stripping effect (MSE), thereby improving the bilateral surface precision either exterior or interior. The cosmic gravity effect criterion is first used to extract surface need support from manifold surface with various materials by considering the balance force involving material characteristics and inclination angle. In the light of this criterion theory, varying the substrate normal orientation (SNO), namely workbench, for each layer in printing coordinate system, may break the balance between gravity and its equilibrium force. Therefore, the optimal SNO can be rigorously calculated using mathematical harmonic analysis among the continuous domain. To serve for the multidegree of freedom (DOF) on account of SNO, a reconfigurable VOT robot with six-axis DOF is developed for 3D printing (3DP). The matched servo controller is successfully implemented to accurate tracking of both orientation and Cartesian coordinates, using forward kinematic chains as well as reverse kinematic tracking. What is more, the end-effector (extruder) is holding perpendicular to the substrate workbench. The physical experiment that takes human external ear auricle, for example, using a layer-based process is implemented via VOT. The MSE due to supporting material can be clearly observed and diminished using an optical microscope. The stripped material from external support via diminution design can be evaluated quantitatively by electronic weighting balance. All of which indicate the findings that external support in 3DP can be virtually reckoned and diminished using VOT rather than the so-called build orientation traversal method. The VOT method upon which we touched can be widely applied to various layered manufacturing of accurate structure, for instance, cantilever, sandwich, and scaffolds in the occasion needing precise curtailment of outer support multimaterial.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) brings new design potential compared with traditional manufacturing. Nevertheless, traditional manufacturing knowledge remains embedded in the minds of designers and is a real cognitive barrier to design in AM. Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM) provides tools, techniques, and guidelines to optimize design with the specifics of AM. These methods are usable at different moments of the design process. Only few DfAMs focus on the early stages of design, the ideation phase, which allows for the most innovation. The literature highlights the effectiveness of methodologies based on tangible tools, such as cards or objects, to generate creativity. The difficulty with such tools is to be inspirational as well as formative. Therefore, this article presents a method to help designers capture the design potential of AM to design creative solutions at the early stages of product design, named the Augmented Design with AM Methodology (ADAM2). This methodology relies on the potential of AM, defined in 14 opportunities and a set of 14 inspirational objects, each representing an opportunity. Dedicated to creativity sessions, this methodology allows forcing the association between knowledge of a company's sector and the design potential of AM. To validate the effectiveness of the ADAM2 methodology, we use it for an industrial application in a jewelry and watchmaking company. The results showed that ADAM2 promote the generation of creative solutions and the exploitation of the design potential of AM during the early design stages.",

    "abstract": "World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs, that is, rifampicin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) fixed-dose combination (FDC) therapies in tuberculosis (TB) disease. The absorption of RIF from an FDC incorporates INH, and it is significantly compromised due to its reaction with INH, resulting in a severe loss of RIF under gastric stomach pH condition. Such reduction in the dose of both drugs from FDC formulations has been alleged to be one of the chief obstacles in effective TB treatment. This emphasizes a need to develop suitable cutting-edge advanced bioengineered delivery devices that can attenuate this severe problem to mitigate this chief obstacle. Therefore, we designed, prototyped, and characterized bioengineered 3D printed housing devices in the form of printed tablets adopting print and fill strategy for segregated compartmental delivery of RIF into the intestine (to avoid stomach gastric pH induced chemical degradation as alone and FDC) and INH into the stomach (no degradation observed as alone and FDC in stomach gastric pH conditions) for the desired treatment outcome against TB. Prepared 3D printed housings showed almost zero friability, enough hardness along weight variations <±3.0%. Different thermal and morphological analyses confirmed the insignificant changes in the nature of the polymer as before and after printing. The in vitro release for INH from polyvinyl alcohol mediated 3D printed housings showed almost 100% release within 2.5 h in acidic medium, whereas poly-lactic acid (PLA) mediated 3D printed housings continued to release RIF above 70% in the presence of physiological enzymes in alkaline medium for 432 h. The in vivo bioavailability assessment correlated with in vitro dissolution behavior for INH and RIF, whereas RIF did not release from 3D printed PLA housings in vivo.",

Concrete AM uses an extrusion method to deposit concrete beads in layers to create a three-dimensional (3D) shape. This method has been found to have many uses and advantages in construction applications. The lack of formwork and autonomous nature of this manufacturing method allows for new geometries and materials to be printed in unsafe or challenging environments. Autonomous construction has been suggested as a method of creating habitats in rapid-response scenarios. This article discusses research toward one such system that could be used to rapidly construct necessary habitats in response to low-resource and emergency situations. This required addressing certain limitations of a six-axis robotic arm platform along with overcoming system challenges to achieve deliverables for NASA's \"3D Printed Habitat Challenge.\" This included system design to increase the build volume, integrate embedding, print non-coplanar sections, and minimize travel moves to address the challenges associated with continuous extrusion of cementitious material. The system was demonstrated by printing a one-third scale habitat, which represents the first 3d-printed fully enclosed structure at an architectural scale without the use of support.",

    "abstract": "This study is focused on the importance of nanohydroxyapatite (nHA) particle morphology with the same particle size range on the rheological behavior of polycaprolactone (PCL) composite ink with nHA as a promising candidate for additive manufacturing technologies. Two different physiologic-like nHA morphologies, that is, plate and rod shape, with particles size less than 100 nm were used. nHA powders were well characterized and the printing inks were prepared by adding the different ratios of nHA powders to 50% w/v of PCL solution (nHA/PCL: 35/65, 45/55, 55/45, and 65/35 w/w%). Subsequently, the influence of nHA particle morphology and concentration on the printability and rheological properties of composite inks was investigated. HA nanopowder analysis revealed significant differences in their microstructural properties, which affected remarkably the composite ink printability in several ways. For instance, adding up to 65% w/w of plate-like nHA to the PCL solution was possible, while nanorod HA could not be added above 45% w/w. The printed constructs were successfully fabricated using the extrusion-based printing method and had a porous structure with interconnected pores. Total porosity and surface area increased with nHA content due to the improved fiber stability following deposition of material ink. Consequently, degradation rate and bioactivity increased, while compressive properties decreased. While nanorod HA particles had a more significant impact on the mechanical strength than plate-like morphology, the latter showed less crystalline order, which makes them more bioactive than nanorod HA. It is therefore important to note that the nHA microstructure broadly affects the printability of printing ink and should be considered according to the intended biomedical applications.",

With additive manufacturing, the fabrication of complex periodic cellular structures with any unit cell form, size, and volume fraction has become a lot easier, allowing for more investment, research, and attention from both academia and industry. The aim of the research was to assess the manufacturability and performance of AlSi10Mg periodic cellular structures generated using the laser powder bed fusion process. Re-entrant and triply periodic and minimum surface (TPMS) gyroid cells were hybridized into a single cellular structure having identical volume fraction. Because of distinct mechanical properties of TPMS and re-entrant types, these cells were selected and assembled in various patterns to study their manufacturability, deformation behavior, energy absorption, and compressive strength. This work demonstrates good geometric agreement between the manufactured hybrid lattice structures and computer-aided design models. Hybridized structures with several repeated layers of TPMS gyroid and re-entrant cells can result in superior compressive strength and energy absorption than those with only few large layers.",

In this study, a custom cryogenic extrusion 3D printer was developed, which afforded control over both the ink and printing surface temperatures. Using this approach, aqueous inks were printed into well-defined layers with high precision. A conductive hydrogel ink was developed from chitosan (CS) and edge-functionalised expanded graphene (EFXG). Different EFXG:CS ratios (between 60:40 and 80:20) were evaluated to determine both conductivity and printability. Using the novel customized cryogenic 3D printer, conductive structures of between 2 and 20 layers were produced, with feature sizes as small as 200 μm. The printed structures are mechanically robust and are electrically conducting. The highest Young's modulus and conductivity in a hydrated state were 2.6 MPa and ∼45 S/m, respectively. Cytocompatibility experiments reveal that the developed material supports NSC-34 mouse motor neuron-like cells in terms of viability, attachment, and proliferation. The distinctive mechanical and electrical properties of the 3D-printed structures would make them good candidates for the engineering of 3D-structured excitable cells.

As a hardware platform, two commercial 3D bioprinters were retrofitted with a rotary axis to accommodate cylindrical mandrels as print beds, overcoming the limitations of planar print beds. The printing process using the new method was evaluated in terms of the mechanical, actuation, and synchronization characteristics of the linear and rotating axes, as well as the stability of the printing process. In this context, it became clear that extrusion-based printing processes are very sensitive to positioning errors when used with small nozzles. Despite these technical difficulties, the new process can produce single-layer, multilayer, and multimaterial structures with a wide range of pore geometries. In addition, extrusion-based printing processes can be combined with melt electrowriting to produce durable scaffolds with features in the micrometer to millimeter range. Overall, the suitability of this setup for a wide range of TE applications has thus been demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing is a process in which digital three-dimensional (3D) design data are used to build a component in layers by accumulating materials. There are many materials used in additive manufacturing technology. The most basic features that distinguish these materials are their strength and electrical behavior. They can be strong or flexible, resistant to abrasion, depending on the application used. Recently, 3D printing filament and polymeric composite materials combined with carbon nanostructures with electrical conductivity have been used. In this study, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), a carbon black-filled conductive material with high strength and hardness, was preferred. The aim in this study is to focus on the mechanical and electrical behavior of the material processed in filament form. Fabrication of samples was done using a fused deposition modeling-based printer that controls filament orientation. Different experimental studies were conducted: (1) mechanical tests to determine the maximum tensile strength values of the samples; and (2) electrical tests to analyze the electrical resistances of the samples. In the design of the first experiment, infill volume, layer height, infill type, and printing direction were determined as factors affecting strength. In the design of the second experiment, the length, nozzle temperature, and measurement temperature were determined as the factors affecting the electrical resistance. Statistical analysis of the measured data was performed to evaluate the overall result of the experiments. Finally, a prediction model of real-time tensile strength and resistance values was created using machine learning algorithms. These algorithms are Gaussian Process Regression and Support Vector Machine. The results confirmed the known linear dependence of electrical resistance on the length of the 3D-printed conductive ABS samples and showed how changing the fabrication settings affected the strength values.",

It is an innovative upgradation of 3D printing procedure, which instills smart capabilities into materials such that they respond to external stimulus. This article aims to investigate the feasibility of 4D printing of polylactic acid (PLA)-based composite scaffolds fabricated by incorporating four different nature-inspired architectures (honeycomb, giant water lily, spiderweb, and nautilus shell). The composites were developed by adding 1, 3, and 5 wt.% of Calcium Phosphate (CaP) into PLA. Various thermomechanical tests were accomplished to evaluate the properties of developed material. Furthermore, the shape memory characteristics of these scaffolds were examined using thermally controlled conditions. The characterization tests displayed favorable outcomes in terms of thermal stability and hydrophilic nature of the PLA and PLA/CaP composite materials. It was found that the honeycomb structure showed the best shape memory and mechanical behavior among the four designs. Furthermore, the introduction of CaP was found to enhance mechanical strength and shape memory property, whereas the surface integrity was adversely affected. This study can play a vital role in developing self-fitting high-shape recovery biomedical scaffolds for bone-repair applications.",

The component has the form of a hollow and rectangular thin wall made of deposition layer of stainless steel SS316L on top of substrate plate of mild steel S235. In this research, thermomechanical finite element analysis was applied with Goldak's double ellipsoid as heat-source model and isotropic hardening rule based on von-Mises yield criterion. A specialized numerical simulation software Simufact.Welding 2021 (SW) was utilized in developing the numerical model and the simulation of process enhanced with separation and deposition algorithm to predict the component deformation after removal of substrate. On determining the best possible mesh size, a sensitivity analysis was conducted before the advanced stage of model development. An advanced material modeling, the data of which were obtained based on the chemical composition of the evolved SS316L sample, was developed using an advanced material modeling software JMATPRO. For verification purpose, a series of WAAM experiments using robotic GMAW with synergic power source were conducted followed by the removal of substrate from component using machining process. Furthermore, component distortion was measured using industrial noncontact 3D scanner with structured blue light to fully capture the upper section deformation and compared with result of numerical computation. It can be concluded that this novel distortion analysis method using thermomechanical numerical computation with evolved material property and modified algorithms for substrate removal exhibits a surface deviation in vertical direction between 0.05 and 2.16 mm with acceptable pointwise and average error percentage of up to 3%.",

In this study, both aspects are considered by proposing a novel aluminum alloy based on Al-Mg-Zn, which is then used for the waDED manufacturing of a car rim. The alloy was characterized in small-scale samples, in which no hot cracks and only a few gas porosities were found. In addition, the high quality of the alloy was verified by tensile tests of the heat-treated samples. The determined yield strength was >365 MPa, the ultimate tensile strength was >450 MPa, and the fracture strain was at least 3.9%. To put the new alloy to use, a standard aluminum car rim model was modified for the needs of waDED. Difficulties due to the steep overhang of the outer ring in the intersecting area with the spokes could be resolved by utilizing and adapting the collision avoidance of the path generation tool in the critical area. The optimization of the welding paths was simplified by first planning the paths using a section of the rim model. The rim geometry was manufactured successfully, and valuable findings regarding the waDED process of parts with medium complexity could be derived.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing/3D printing (AM/3DP) has become a practical manufacturing modality in fabricating highly-complex/optimized parts, providing a form-free flexibility for the development of high-value/high-performance products. However, significant build-to-build variabilities in geometric tolerances and mechanical strength have often been reported as shortcomings. Currently, AM/3DP lacks a practical in situ/real-time quality monitoring utility. In fused filament fabrication, the quality of production in a uniform build depends on two fundamental parameters: the strength of each thread (an extruded line of filament material, created by the heated nozzle) and the nature/strength of thread-to-thread bonds in (in-plate) horizontal and (out-of-plane) vertical directions. In this study, we present an in situ/real-time monitoring approach, in which, instead of monitoring the actual build, the spectral characteristics of elastic wave propagation in a specially designed artifact having periodic internal structures are monitored. The design of an artifact is based on the geometric complexities of the actual build, and its internal structures amplify certain specified aspects of its AM/3DP process and materials. Furthermore, the artifact is substantially simpler and smaller than the actual build it represents, thus considerably easier to monitor. In this study, the artifact design consists of repeating biperiodic substructures of sparsely located threads. As a model problem, in this study we introduce and report a simple phononic crystal artifact design with varying thread-crossing angles and the effects of thread orientation and placement on the shifts of its pass and stop bands and/or the creation of stop bands. In current proof-of-concept study, an experimental setup and basic artifact designs are described, off-line monitoring data are presented, and the sensitivity of the approach is analyzed.",

The frozen-form method (FFM) (also known as low-temperature deposition manufacturing) can be used to fabricate scaffolds from biomedical polymers. These scaffolds may have both macroporous and microporous characteristics and may incorporate bioactive compounds or biomolecules during the process. In addition, scaffolds produced at low temperatures can prevent the occurrence of thermal hydrolysis, thereby improving the mechanical properties of scaffolds. In fabricating high-quality (without deformation and collapse) bioscaffolds through the FFM, the most crucial requirement is the creation of a uniform low-temperature environment. This study developed a frozen-form additive manufacturing system that includes a uniform cryogenic device to generate the uniform distribution of a low-temperature environment over a local region to produce large scaffolds that will not deform and collapse. A large square scaffold block and a high aspect ratio tubular scaffold were fabricated to verify the efficiency of this system. Furthermore, this study employed a selective compliance assembly robot arm to traverse two-dimensional deposition paths, unlike the conventional Cartesian gantry system. This study investigated the challenges stemming from the use of such a device for scaffold production and suggests methods for resolving such issues.",

Poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL), a semicrystalline polymer mainly used for biomedical and life science applications, is the most prominent material for MEW and exhibits excellent printing properties.

Hence, this study systematically examines the influence of process parameters such as spinneret diameter, feeding pressure, and collector velocity on the diameter and particularly the topography of PCL fibers and sheds light on how these parameters affect the mechanical properties and crystallinity. A correlation between the mechanical properties, crystallite size, and roughness of the deposited fiber, depending on the collector velocity and applied feeding pressure, is revealed.

For example, the laser scan location on the build plate can slightly change the MP size and shape due to the f-θ optics of the printer. The laser scan parameters can cause variations in MP signatures that may indicate lack-of-fusion and keyhole regimes. However, the effects of these process parameters on MP monitoring (MPM) signatures and part properties are not yet fully understood, especially during a multilayer big-part printing. In this study, our objective is to comprehensively evaluate the dynamical changes of MP signatures (location, intensity, size, and shape) under realistic printing scenarios—printing multilayer objects at different build plate locations with various print process settings. To accomplish this, we developed a coaxial high-speed camera-based MPM system for a commercial LPBF printer (EOS M290), to capture MP images continuously throughout a multilayer part. From our experimental data and results, we find that the MP image position on the camera sensor is not stationary as reported in the literature and is partly subjected to scan location. Its correlations to process deviation or part defect need to be determined. Also, the MP image profile can significantly reflect the changes in print process conditions. The developed system and analysis method can be used to establish a comprehensive profile of MP image signatures for online process diagnosis and part properties prediction, thus ensuring quality assurance and control in LPBF.",

    "abstract": "Do extrusion temperature, printing speed, and layer time affect mechanical performance of interlayer bonds in material extrusion additive manufacturing (MEAM)? The question is one of the main challenges in 3D printing of polymers. This article aims to analyze the independent effect of printing parameters on interlayer bonding in MEAM. In previous research, printing parameters were unavoidably interrelated, such as printing speed and layer cooling time. Here, original specimen designs allow the effects to be studied independently for the first time to provide new understanding of the effects of a wide range of thermal factors on mechanical properties of 3D-printed polylactide. The experimental approach used direct GCode design to manufacture specially designed single-filament-thick specimens for tensile testing to measure mechanical and thermal properties normal to the interface between layers. In total, five different extrusion temperatures (a range of 60°C), five different printing speeds (a 16-fold change in the magnitude) and four different layer times (an 8-fold change) were independently studied. The results demonstrate interlayer bond strength to be equivalent to that of the bulk material within experimental scatter. This study provides strong evidence about the crucial role of microscale geometry for apparent interlayer bond strength relative to the role of thermal factors. By designing specimens specifically for the MEAM process, this study clearly demonstrates that bulk-material strength can be achieved for interlayer bonds in MEAM even when printing parameters change severalfold. Widespread industrial and academic efforts to improve interlayer bonding should be refocused to study extrusion geometry-the primary cause of anisotropy in MEAM.",

The topology-based design technique is focused to construct the lattice structure using a continuous thin rod. The layers are stacked in an additive manner to construct the three-dimensional lattice structure. The dip-coating meditate material transfer facilitates the node joining using transient liquid phase diffusion bonding, and hence, the manufacturing of the complex lattice structure is performed.

Viscoelasticity related to rheological properties is correlative of the printability of bioink for extrusion bioprinting, which affects the complexity of printing 3D structures. This article shows the use of hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) as a rheological additive for engineering bioink to improve the printability without reducing the biocompatibility. Different concentrations of HEC were added to four types of bioink, namely, reagent-crosslinked, temperature-dependent phase change, ultraviolet-polymerized, and composite hydrogel bioinks, to investigate the effect on the viscoelasticity properties, print fidelity, and other printed scaffold properties. The results indicate that HEC is able to increase the rheological properties by 100 times to stabilize complex structures and improve the printing fidelity to narrow the gap between the design value and theoretical value, even converting nonviscous ink into directly printable ink, as well as tune the swelling ratio for better molecular permeability.

    "abstract": "Many users relate additive manufacturing (AM) directly with fast and high-quality prototyping and manufacturing. Nevertheless, already within the different printing techniques there are significant printing time differences for the same polymer printed objects. For AM, there are currently two main known methods to three-dimensional (3D) print objects: One is the vat polymerization process using liquid crystal display (LCD) polymerization, also known as masked stereolithography (MSLA). The other is material extrusion, known as fused filament fabrication (FFF) or fused deposition modeling. Both processes can be found in the private sector (desktop printers) or in industry. The FFF and MSLA processes apply material layer by layer to 3D print objects, but both processes are different in their printing techniques. The different printing methods result in different printing speeds for the same 3D printed object. Geometry models are used to investigate which design elements affect the printing speed without changing the actual printing parameters. Support and infill are also taken into account. The influencing factors will be shown to optimize the printing time. With the assistance of the different slicer software, the influence factors were calculated and the different variants are pointed out. The determined correlations help to find the suitable printing technique to make optimum use of the printing performance of both technologies.",

However, the digital workflow of patient-specific maxillofacial prostheses (MFP) remains incomplete, and several steps in the manufacturing process are still labor-intensive and are costly in both time and resources. Despite the high demand for direct digital MFP manufacturing, three-dimensional (3D) printing of colored silicone MFP is limited by the processing routes of medical-grade silicones and biocompatible elastomers. In this study, a binder jetting 3D printing process with polyvinyl butyral (PVB)-coated silicone powder was developed for direct 3D printing of MFP. Nanosilica-treated silicone powder was spray dried with PVB by controlling the Ohnesorge number and processing parameters. After printing, the interconnected pores were infused with silicone and hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDS) by pressure-vacuum sequential infiltration to produce the final parts. Particle size, coating composition, surface treatment, and infusion conditions influenced the mechanical properties of the 3D-printed preform, and of the final infiltrated structure. In addition to demonstrating the feasibility of using silicone powder-based 3D printing for MFP, these results can be used to inform the modifications required to accommodate the manufacturing of other biocompatible elastomeric materials.",

    "abstract": "Embedded in a long tradition of craftsmanship, inside or outside building surfaces, is often treated with plaster, which plays both functional and ornamental roles. Today, plasterwork is predominantly produced through rationalized, time-, and cost-efficient processes, used for standardized building elements. These processes have also gained interest in the construction robotics field, and while such approaches target the direct automation of standardized plasterwork, they estrange themselves from the inherent qualities of this malleable material that are well known from the past. This research investigates the design potentials of robotic plaster spraying, proposing an adaptive, thin-layer vertical printing method for plasterwork that aims to introduce a digital craft through additive manufacturing. The presented work is an explorative study of a digitally controlled process that can be applied to broaden the design possibilities for the surfaces of building structures. It involves the spraying of multiple thin layers of plaster onto a vertical surface to create volumetric formations or patterns, without the use of any formwork or support structures. This article describes the experimental setup and the initial results of the data collection method involving systematic studies with physical testing, allowing to develop means to predict and visualize the complex-to-simulate material behavior, which might eventually enable to design with the plasticity of this material in a digital design tool.",

Although ocular prostheses have been 3D printed successfully, iris colors are often manually added to the final product afterward. The objective was to produce a 3D-printed ocular prosthesis with textured iris and sclera in one single print job. We designed an average 3D model of an ocular prosthesis in 3D software, and took a high-resolution digital photograph of a human eye, which was processed in graphical software. By using functions called \"displacement mapping\" and \"UV mapping\" on the 3D model, the extent of height displacement was used to digitally produce a textured and colored iris and sclera on the 3D model. By using a polyjet 3D printer, different colors and materials could be used for different prosthesis components. We were able to design and 3D print a lifelike ocular prosthesis with realistic iris and sclera texture. The process took less than 4 h, of which 2.5 h are \"printing time,\" reducing labor time compared with conventional methods. This proof-of-concept adds valuable knowledge to the future manufacture of 3D-printed ocular prostheses, which has several benefits over the conventional production method: 3D printing is much faster, reproducible, and prostheses can easily be digitally adjusted and reprinted. This study is an important step in the development of a full-fledged 3D workflow to produce lifelike custom eye prostheses.",

Yet, little is explored about the cytotoxicity of leachable toxins that the 3D printing process introduced into the final product. We studied three printable materials, which have various mechanical properties and are widely used in stereolithography 3D printing. We evaluated the cytotoxicity of these materials through exposing two fibroblast cell lines (human and mouse derived) to the 3D-printed parts, using overlay indirect contact assays. All the 3D-printed parts were measured toxic to the cells in a leachable manner, with flexible materials more toxic than rigid materials. Furthermore, we attempted to reduce the toxicity of the 3D-printed material by employing three treatment methods (further curing, passivation coating, and Soxhlet solvent extraction). The Soxhlet solvent extraction method was the most effective in removing the leachable toxins, resulting in the eradication of the material's toxicity. Passivation coating and further curing showed moderate and little detoxification, respectively. Additionally, mechanical testing of the materials treated with extraction methods revealed no significant impacts on its mechanical performances. As leachable toxins are broadly present in 3D-printed polymers, our cytotoxicity evaluation and reduction methods could aid in extending the selections of biocompatible materials and pave the way for the translational use of 3D printing.",

Due to supply chain disruptions, the need for innovation has emerged both as a priority and a necessity and three-dimensional printing (3DP) proved to be a primary, smart, effective, and innovative additive manufacturing (AM) method. AM refers to the direct fabrication of complex geometries, using a computer-aided design (CAD) model or a three-dimensional scanner output. This article presents a literature review of AM technologies, chronologically sorted, and proposes a multilevel classification model. The suggested research approach appears a triangular methodology that encompasses the current ISO/ASTM 52900:2021 report. The first objective of this article is to form two double-level classification models of AM processes, depending on the technology and material factors. The second objective is to clarify in which of the proposed categories each AM process is included; and the third one is to investigate if the proposed taxonomy is related to the time spot, in which AM processes were invented. The contribution of this article lies in determining the factors that are crucial for the growth of AM ecosystem. The novelty of the proposed classification lies in the definition of an optimal option for each industrial application based on the different AM processes, the variety of materials, and the evolution of technology over the years. In this way, investing in AM is more systematic and less risky.",

    "abstract": "Although the additive manufacturing (AM) market continues to grow, industries face barriers to AM adoption due to a shortage of skilled designers in the workforce that can apply AM effectively to meet this demand. This shortage is attributed to the high cost and infrastructural requirements of introducing high- barrier-to-entry AM processes such as powder bed fusion (PBF) into in-person learning environments. To meet the demands for a skilled AM workforce, it is important to explore other mediums of AM education, such as computer-aided instruction (CAI) and virtual reality (VR), which can increase access to hands-on learning experiences for inaccessible AM processes. However, limited work compares virtual and physical AM instruction or explores how the differences in immersion and presence between mediums can affect the knowledge gained and the mental effort exerted when learning about different AM processes. To address this gap in the literature, this research evaluates the use of CAI, VR, and in-person instruction in AM process education when learning about material extrusion (ME) and PBF. Our findings show that the differences in immersion and presence between CAI, VR, and in-person instruction do not have a statistically significant effect when learning about ME, but do have a significant effect when learning about PBF. Specifically, we found that VR generally yields equivalent effects in knowledge gain and cognitive load to in-person PBF education while offering advantages in both metrics over CAI learning. The findings from this work thus have significant implications for using VR as an alternative to in-person training to improve designer development in process-centric AM education of typically high-barrier-to-entry AM processes.",

    "abstract": "Multimaterial additive manufacturing is expanding the design space realizable with 3D printing, yet is largely constrained to sequential deposition of each individual material. The ability to coextrude two materials and change the ratio of materials while printing would enable custom-tailored polymer composites. Here, the evolution of a dynamic material coextrusion process for additive manufacturing capable of printing any ratio between and including two neat input materials is described across 3 hot-end generations and 14 implemented design iterations. The designs evolved with increased understanding of manufacturing constraints associated with the additive manufacturing of metal components with internal flow bore diameters on the order of 2 mm and typical bore length around 50 mm. The second generation overcame this issue by partitioning the design into two pieces to locate the flow channel geometry at the interface between the components so that the details could be easily printed on the components' external surfaces. The third concept generation then focused on minimizing flow channel volume to reduce the average length when transitioning between materials by 92%. The third-generation design was also used to investigate the improvements in dimensional stability during annealing of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) made possible by coextruding ABS with a polycarbonate (PC) core. The standard deviation of part shrinkage after annealing was 7.08% for the neat ABS but reduced to 0.24% for the coextruded ABS/PC components.",

The interfacial shear strength slightly decreased with the increase of the replacement ratio of recycled sand, while it sharply decreased with the extension of printing interval time. The interfaces in 3D printed recycled mortar had higher time sensitivity compared with 3D printed natural mortar. Considering that discontinuous construction will introduce inferior interfaces in 3D printed concrete components, effective surface treatments should be conducted.

    "abstract": "A new method for producing parts in the expanding sector is additive manufacturing. The appropriate name for three-dimensional (3D) printing is additive manufacturing because it produces the part layer by layer. Plastics and metals can be 3D printed in large quantities with the precise surface finish and feature quality needed in additive manufacturing. More specifically, direct metal sintering, direct energy deposition, and metal binder jetting are used in 3D printing. The computer-aided design model is completed when the powder bed has been successively scanned and lowered. The metal sintering process uses a powder bed with powder metal, and laser selectively melts a flattened bed of powder, which is done with roller with successive rolling of new layer on previous into desired shape before a new layer is pushed on top of the previous layer. As a result, the new layer has solidified on top of the earlier layer, causing the prior layer to melt back again. Because of the unique thermal cycle, this results in residual stress (RS). The unique thermal cycle of metal additive manufacturing is characterized by (1) rapid heating rate caused by high energy intensity and steep temperature gradients; (2) rapid solidification with high cooling rates because of the small volume of melt pool; and (3) melt back, which involves simultaneous melting of the top powder layer and re-melting of underlying previously solidified layers. The presence of RS in metal additive manufacturing (AM) creates difficulties that restrict the process's ability to produce parts at an industrial scale. During and after manufacturing, these forces may cause parts to distort and crack. This can be solved by heating the powder bed, which will lessen this type of issue. The causes, traits, and reduction of RS are the main topics of this review article. A number of conceptual approaches to reducing RS are addressed to provide some useful inspiration for creating a methodical RS balancing procedure for AM. These approaches are based on the state and future of the relevant techniques.",

    "abstract": "The ability to jet a wide variety of materials consistently from print heads remains a key technical challenge for inkjet-based additive manufacturing processes. Drop watching is the most direct method for testing new inks and print head designs but such experiments are also resource consuming. In this work, a data-efficient machine learning technique called active learning is used to construct detailed jettability diagrams that identify complex regions corresponding to \"no jetting,\" \"jetting,\" and \"desired jetting,\" rather than only individually sampled points. Crucially, our active learning method has resolved challenges with model selection that previously limited the accuracy of active learning in practical settings with very small experimental budgets. In addition, the key \"desired jetting\" zone may be quite small which is a challenge for initializing active learning. We leverage the physical intuition that the \"desired jetting\" zone tends to exist between the \"jetting\" and \"no jetting\" zone, to improve the performance of this highly imbalanced classification problem by performing two binary classifications in sequence. The first binary classification aims to map out the \"jetting\" zone versus the \"no jetting\" zone, while the second binary classification targets identifying the \"desired jetting\" zone with primary drops only. Our experiments use a stroboscopic drop watcher to visualize the jetting behavior of two fluids from a piezoelectric print head with different jetting waveforms. The results obtained from active learning were compared to a grid search method, which involves running more than 200 experiments for each fluid. The active learning method significantly reduces the number of experiments by 80% while achieving a test accuracy of more than 95% in the \"jetting\" zone prediction for the test fluids. The ability to construct these jettability diagrams will further accelerate new ink and print head developments.",

Thanks to the ease of application of the WAAM, more than one same or different material can be involved in the production process. Thus, WAAM has the potential to produce new material structures from raw wire metals with different chemical contents. In this study, it was aimed to produce a new alloy structure using WAAM. A novel cold wire feeding technique with an external system and gas metal arc welding (GMAW) process was implemented for the fabricating of a new alloy part. In the fabrication process, two different grades and ratios of ER70S-6 (90%) and 316LSi (10%) steel wires were used and melted simultaneously. The new alloy structure was successfully fabricated, and significant changes were found in the microstructure and tensile strength because of Cr and Ni elements transferred from the secondary wire (316LSi). In the microstructure of the new alloy, structures such as acicular ferrite, martensite, and bainite were observed. As a result of the different fabrication approach applied, a significant increase in tensile strength was found. The tensile strength of the new alloy structure exceeded 1000 MPa and almost 100% increase in strength was observed compared to single-material structures. In addition, the ductility of the produced structure was found to be sufficient. The study showed that new alloys with improved mechanical properties can be produced with the cold wire feeding + GMAW approach.",

However, the biological inert of the titanium alloy hindered firm bonding between the bone and porous scaffold. Surface roughness that resulted from sandblasting treatment with alumina sand grains could endow the titanium alloy scaffold with bioactivity. Minimum and maximum-type cervical and posterior lumbar cages were used to optimize the sandblasting process, achieving an adequate and uniform sandblasting effect. The optimized sandblasting process parameters were as follows: alumina sand grains of 100 mesh, sandblasting distance of 10 cm, sandblasting pressure of 0.4–0.5 MPa, and sandblasting time of 15–20 s.",

In this study, as functionalization, an incorporation of deviating weight ratios (28–20 wt%) of carbon black into the polymer matrix through a compounding process is shown. The resulting adjustable specific electrical resistivity (0.6–17 Ωm) of the conducive COC is specified with a high-precision measuring method. The material blends are used for the fabrication of several structures utilizing the electrical conductivity. With a panel of eight different solvents, the solvent and additionally the temperature stability are compared with those of a commercially available clear/conductive polylactic acid material set.

Here we review examples of AM of biobased environmentally interactive materials using biopolymer composites, electrochemical and resistive devices, active molecules, bio sensors, living cells, spores, or cell-free sites, resulting in genetically active, and physical and chemical interactive systems.

Challenges in achieving autonomy include: bulky energy sources, imprecise deployment, jamming of components and lack of structural integrity. Leveraging advances in the fields of shape memory polymers, bistability and 3D multi-material printing, we present a 3D printed programmable actuator that enables the autonomous deployment and shape reconfiguration of structures activated though surrounding temperature change. Using a shape memory polymer as the temperature controllable energy source and a bistable mechanism as the linear actuator and force amplifier, the structures achieve precise geometric activation and quantifiable load bearing capacity. The proposed unit actuator integrates these two components and is designed to be assembled into larger deployable and shape reconfigurable structures. First, we demonstrate that the activation of the unit actuator can be sequenced by tailoring each shape memory polymer to a different activation time. Next, by changing the configuration of the actuator, we demonstrate an initially flat surface that transforms into a pyramid or a hyperbolic paraboloid, thus demonstrating a multi-state structure. Load bearing capability is demonstrated for both during activation and in the operating state.",

    "abstract": "The size of engineered tissue constructs is mainly constrained by diffusion limitations in the bulk materials. It has been proposed that engineering of constructs with embedded perfusable vascular networks might advance the engineering of larger tissue constructs and allow novel applications for biomedical studies. However, the progress in this field so far is relatively slow. A possible reason could be that the equipment and software needed to design and produce such constructs were so far out of reach for most laboratories. In this study, we present an economic and fast technique for the fabrication of such cell-laden hydrogels with an integrated perfusable vessel-like channel, based on open source approaches. We designed the molds and devices using free open source software and fabricated them using widely available low-cost thermoplast 3D printing using polylactic acid. With a soft lithographic technique, channels in cell-laden agarose hydrogels were fabricated within the printed device. Medium perfusion was performed for 1 and 3 days. We could show that the formed channels within the agarose hydrogels sustained perfusion without deformation. Cell viability was closely associated with flow conditions and distance from the channels, suggesting channel-dependent transport of nutrients and oxygen to the cells. In the flow group, cell viability in the first 300 μm around the channels stayed at 90% over 3 days, while it dropped to ∼50% in all the no-flow conditions, as well as at distances of >1200 μm from the channels in the flow condition. The vessel-like channels in the hydrogels fabricated in this approach provided nutrient supply to the surrounding cells. The described technique allows the construction and maintenance of bigger tissue engineered constructs with widely available hardware at a relatively low price and may therefore become a platform for the study of larger tissue constructs and embedded vascular structures.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is a fascinating technology that is poised to transform the practice of medicine in the 21st century. The Society for Technology in Anesthesia hosted an engineering challenge to use a 3D printer to create a customized oral airway based on a patient's anatomy. We approached this challenge in two parts. First, we identified a model for an oral airway to base our prototype. We created a 3D rendering of the customizable oral airway and designed a user interface that would accept specific measurements to create a customized oral airway. We then rendered a 3D model of the patient's airway and surrounding structures using Mimics (Materialise, Leuven, Belgium). The model was optimized for an Object Connex (Stratasys, Eden Prairie, MN), which has the capability of printing in various materials. We specified softer materials for the flexible tissues such as the tongue, palate, vocal cords, and epiglottis; a more rigid material was utilized for the supporting structures such as the mandible, nose, and bony structures. Furthermore, we printed the model in various parts, consisting of the tongue, jaw, trachea, and head/neck, that would articulate to make up the head and neck. The head and neck was one continuous part, divided sagittally at the midline, and the trachea was divided in the coronal plane. The printing process took ∼30 h of printing time and resulted in an anatomically correct model that included the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and trachea with an articulating mandible. We describe the process of designing and producing anatomic models for medical device prototype design. We propose a methodology of evaluating medical device prototypes using anatomically accurate models manufactured with 3D printers.",

It was produced from cellulose nanocrystals and cellulose micro-powder particles within a bioderived thermally cured polyester matrix based on glycerol, citric acid, and sebacic acid. The effect of curing duration on the material's shape memory behavior was quantified by using two thermo-mechanical approaches to measure recovery: (1) displacement in three-point bending and (2) angular recovery from a beam bent at 90° in a single cantilever setup. Extending curing duration increased the material's glass-transition temperature from -26°C after 6 h to 13°C after 72 h of curing. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed the associated progressive conversion of functional groups consistent with polyester formation. Slow recovery rates and low levels of shape recovery (22-70%) were found for samples cured less than 24 h. Those results also indicated a high dependence on the measurement approach. In contrast, samples cured for 48 and 72 h exhibited faster recovery rates, a significantly higher recovery percentage (90-100%) and were less sensitive to the measurement approach. Results demonstrated that once a sufficient curing threshold was achieved, additional curing time could be used to tune the material glass-transition temperature and create heat-triggered 3D-printed products.",

A promising alternative for improving structural build-up is the use of entrained air (EA), as bubbles, whose effects are reviewed in generic yield stress fluids and then specifically in concrete. After revision of micromechanical models and experimental trials from literature on yield stress fluid bubble suspensions and concrete, EA appears to be ideal for 3DCP when generated by anionic surfactants, as it increases static yield stress and decreases plastic viscosity. Cationic surfactants, however, maintain or slightly decrease static yield stress. It is proposed that the lubricating or stiffening property of the bubbles determines their ability to deform under the shear stress generated by the surrounding fluid. The ability to deform depends on the surfactant used to entrain the bubbles and the mixture design of the concrete. Further experimental research must be carried out for the advantages of EA to be fully realized.",

To use the biomass waste materials in AM technology, such as furniture and wood flooring, this composite based on agricultural waste is environmentally friendly, energy efficient, and low in production cost. SLS parts made from PHPC had good mechanical strength and excellent dimensional precision (DP). The thermal decomposition temperature of composite powder components and the glass transition temperatures of PES and various PHPC were determined first to prevent the PHPC parts from warping during sintering.

Particle distribution and microstructure of the powders and the SLS parts (both before and after breakage in mechanical tests) were inspected using scanning electron microscopy. According to the combined results, a ratio of PHP/PES = 10/90 (w/w) resulted in the best forming quality and mechanical strength compared with other ratios and pure PES.

Yet, the effects of printing parameters on the shape-memory properties of printed SMPs remain poorly understood. To study the extent to which the 3D printing process affects the shape-memory properties of a printed SMP part, here temperature, extrusion rate multiplier, and fiber orientation were systematically varied, and their effect on shape-memory fixing and recovery ratios was evaluated. Fiber orientation, as determined by print path relative to the direction(s) of loading during shape-memory programming, was found to significantly impact the fixing ratio and the recovery ratio. Temperature and multiplier had little effect on either fixing ratio or recovery ratio. To facilitate the use of printed SMP parts in biomedical applications, a cell viability assay was performed on 3D-printed samples prepared using varied temperature and multiplier. Reduction in multiplier was found to increase cell viability. The results indicate that fiber orientation can critically impact the shape-memory functionality of 3D-printed SMP parts, and that multiplier can affect cytocompatibility of those parts. Thus, researchers and manufacturers employing SMPs in 3D-printed parts and devices could achieve improved part functionality if print paths are designed to align fiber direction with the axis(es) in which strain will be programmed and recovered and if the multiplier is optimized in biomedical applications in which a part will contact cells.",

In addition, due to the resistance difference of the damaged and intact areas, crack diagnosing can be realized by infrared thermograph under electricity.

    "abstract": "This article introduces the concept of Impact Printing, a new additive manufacturing (AM) method that aggregates malleable discrete elements (or soft particles) by a robotic shooting process. The bonding between the soft particles stems from the transformation of kinetic energy, gained during the acceleration phase, into plastic deformation upon impact. Hence, no additional binding material is needed between the soft particles; the cohesion and self-interlocking capacities of the material itself acts as the primary binding agent. Shooting, and consequent impacting, forces can be modulated and result in distinct compaction ratios. By linearly shooting material, we decouple the deposition apparatus from the produced parts and provide flexibility to the deposition process to potentially build in any directions or onto uncontrolled surfaces. Impact Printing produces parts with formal characteristics standing between brick laying-assembly of discrete building blocks-and 3D Printing-computer-controlled depositioning or solidifying of material. It brings forward a novel digital fabrication method and an alternative to the conventional continuous AM process. This article validates the Impact Printing approach with a series of prototypical experiments, conducted with a robotic fabrication setup consisting of a six-axis robotic arm mounted with a material shooting apparatus, that forms, orients, and projects the soft particles. We will explain and demonstrate its principles and define the fabrication parameters, such as shooting force, shooting distance, and the resulting aggregations' characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) concrete printing technology has been considered promising, attracting extensive attention in the engineering field. Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have been used as an additive to reinforce the cement-based material. However, the research on the 3D printed MWCNT-reinforced high-strength concrete is rare. This research is to study the mechanical properties and pore structure of MWCNT-reinforced reactive powder concrete (RPC) for 3D printing. In this research, the workability of the printed RPC mixture with MWCNTs was first tested to pass the criteria of 3D printing. Then, the enhancement effect of MWCNTs on the printed RPC was tested by mechanical properties after hardening. Meanwhile, strength–displacement curves were recorded. In addition, the pore structures of printed RPC were observed and analyzed by X-ray computed tomography (CT) images. The results show that 0.05 wt% MWCNTs have no effect on the workability of the printable RPC slurry. MWCNTs could enhance the mechanical properties of the printed RPC by filling the flaws inside the samples, increasing the viscosity of the RPC slurry and forming bridges between cracks. Besides, 0.05 wt% MWCNTs may cause the failure mode of the printed RPC from brittle failure to ductile failure. In addition, MWCNTs significantly reduced the porosity of the printed RPC by decreasing pores with a volume over 0.01 mm3. As CT images show, the interlayer zone (IZ) of the 3D printed RPC sample is prone to pores, and a higher volume fraction is evident. In particular, within the volume of IZs, the minimum volume fraction at the IZ of 3D printed RPC appears on sample with MWCNTs.",

The benefits of AM have led to recent interest in producing multifunctional materials capable of being printed with current AM technologies. In this article, piezoresistive composites realized by AM and the matrices and fillers utilized to make such devices are introduced and discussed.

    "abstract": "The article asks how additive manufacturing for the circular bioeconomy can create the foundation for rethinking the architectural axioms of permanence and durability, instead moving us toward a new ideal of renewability and repair. It presents a case study into additive manufacturing for repair through the 3D printing of biopolymer composites. This case study connects machine vision-based surveying of damaged panels with repair through conformal 3D printing. This deployment of bio-based materials aims to enable additive manufacturing as a method for disrupting the sharp delineation between fabrication and repair leading to new practices of continual construction. With point of departure in our bespoke systems for 3D printing and unique biopolymer composites, we examine how their particular material characteristics allow for material adhesion and buildup and how novel methods for iterative 3D printing can support design integrated strategies of repair. As part of this process, we include the sociotechnological dimension, as human-in-the-loop decision-making becomes part of the material surveying regimes necessary for damage detection. The article demonstrates processes of repair through three repair actions that address different kinds of damage.",

    "abstract": "Producing synthetic scaffolds with adequate physical, chemical, and biological properties remains a challenge for tissue engineering. Internal architecture, surface chemistry, and material properties have strong impact on the cell biological behavior. This requires sophisticated systems not only able to process multiple materials with different characteristics, creating fully interconnected 3D porous structures with high reproducibility and accuracy, but also able to modify their properties during the fabrication process. This study introduces a novel additive manufacturing system comprising a multiprinting unit (screw-assisted and pressure-assisted printing heads) together with a plasma unit that enables the surface modification of printed scaffolds. Poly(ɛ-caprolactone) scaffolds with a lay-down pattern of 0/90° were fabricated using the screw-assisted printing head and a plasma jet unit used to uniformly modify each layer, a specific region of each layer during the printing process or the external surface of the printed scaffolds. Scaffolds were produced using different plasma exposure times and different distance between the plasma head and the printed layer, and fixed printing conditions. Produced scaffolds were morphologically, mechanically, chemically, and biologically characterized. Results show that the distance between the plasma head and the printed material has no significant effect on the mechanical properties, whereas the increase of the plasma deposition velocity increases the mechanical properties. As expected, plasma treatment increases hydrophilicity and consequently the biological performance of the scaffolds. Results also show the potential of the proposed fabrication system to create functional gradient or scaffolds with tailored properties.",

    "abstract": "Presented here are thermoplastic fused filament fabrication (FFF) three-dimensional (3D) printed piezo-resistive pressure sensors for daily activities utilized on a prosthetic feedback system. The 3D printed pressure sensors were manufactured from various low elastic modulus composites comprising a compressible thermoplastic elastomer and conductive carbon. Carbon is in graphite form and added in high filler ratios. The printed sensors were compared to sensors that were fabricated in a gravity mold to highlight the difference in printed sensors to molded sensors. The design is an improvement on the current prosthetic pressure sensors that are either strain gage or thick/thin film-based sensors. The 3D printed pressure sensor has a thickness and feel similar to human skin, has a simple fabrication technique, and can be manufactured into user-specific geometries. Being FFF 3D printed, the sensor can be easily printed in smaller or larger sizes to create custom layouts or patterns for pressure sensor feedback systems. Where strain gage sensors are bulky and expensive and thick/thin film sensors do not provide aesthetic comparability and require complex manufacturing techniques, result in higher costs. The material was first characterized to establish the operating applied constant voltage and to demonstrate the low elastic modulus. The results from the cyclic voltammetry showed an ideal operating voltage of −0.2 V, and the modulus of the different composite types ranged from 1.83 × 10−4 to 6.01 × 10−4 GPa. After characterizing the composites, each was tested under a force to measure the change in current with an applied load. The FFF 3D printed sensors are able to detect pressure levels between 340.63 Pa and 51.09 kPa, and the molded sensors are able to detect pressure levels between 17.03 Pa and 47.69 kPa. The work presented here shows that a 3D printed prosthetic pressure sensor can be fabricated for daily activities and how 3D printing can impact the medical field.",

    "abstract": "In this article we present a biomimicking skeletal muscle actuator for prosthetics to overcome the issues of high operating temperatures, low contractile strain, complexity, high weight and cost, and linear output as seen with current and academic prosthetic actuators. The actuator proposed is a fuse filament fabrication (FFF) printed shape memory polymer (SMP) actuator that has nonlinear contractile and passive forces, contractile forces and strains comparable with mammalian skeletal muscle, reaction time under 1 s, low operating temperature of 70°C, and has a low mass (74.0 mg), volume (46.74 mm3), and material costs of $0.0098 per actuator. The FFF actuator is a SMP melt blend composite of polylactic acid and thermoplastic polyurethane with a mixture ratio of 7:3. The FFF actuator here has nonlinear contractile properties that have peak contractile stresses ranging from 0.58 to 0.17 MPa for 100–60% applied strains, respectively, where mammalian contraction values range from 0.1 MPa (typical/average) to 0.45 MPa (maximum). In addition, the optimal strain of 60% has a strain recovery of 29.2%, which is comparable with the 20% for typical mammalian skeletal muscle strains. The actuator material was first characterized with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and tensile testing to determine the quality of extruded filament followed by force generation and strain recovery. Lastly, the FFF actuator was tested for thermal degradation and layer adhesion with SEM and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) testing. SEM imaging revealed that there are layer separations throughout the actuator and DSC showed thermal degradation caused by oxidation and random chain scission due to thermal cycling.",

    "abstract": "Bioresorbable stents (BRSs) offer the potential to improve long-term patency rates by providing support just long enough for an artery to heal. However, producing a BRS for an intended period of support time is rather difficult. Nowadays in the stent industry, the current manufacturing process used is laser microcutting. Nevertheless, in the case of BRSs based on polymers, three-dimensional (3D) additive manufacturing (AM) techniques could be the better solution. Developing AM techniques to produce BRSs and studying how these technologies affect the stents' properties are indispensible nowadays. In this context, the present work aims to study the effect that the 3D printing process has on the degradation rate of polycaprolactone (PCL) stents. This is because degradation rate is one of the most important properties of a stent if the appropriate amount of time to heal atherosclerosis is to be provided. This work employs a 3D tubular printer designed by our group and presents the effects that printing temperature, flow rate, and speed have on the degradation rate of PCL stents in both dynamic and static conditions. Tests on the molecular weight, material structure, degradation rate, and radial expansion were performed. Results showed that the printing process does in fact influence the degradation rate by accelerating it as the printing temperature and flow rate increase. Furthermore, the static method degraded the samples faster. Finally, all samples showed great stability in their radial behavior, barely changing after 8 weeks of degradation. The results encourage us to believe that tubular 3D printing could well be a solution for BRS production.",

    "abstract": "Al-Cu-Sn alloy deposits with different Sn contents were prepared by the wire and arc additive manufacturing process. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the deposits were examined by metallography, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and tensile tests. The results indicated that the addition of Sn significantly refined the microstructure of the deposits in their as-deposited state, and the grains were transformed from dendrites to equiaxed crystals with a uniform grain size of ∼30 μm. For the deposits with Sn ≥0.15%, the continuous and elongated θ phase on the grain boundary became block-shaped, and the size of the precipitated phase increased. After T6 heat treatment, the θ phase completely dissolved in the substrate in the deposits with Sn ≤0.1%, whereas the θ-phase solid dissolution was incomplete in the deposits with Sn ≥0.15%; the higher the Sn content, the greater the amount of θ phase remaining. After the T6 treatment, the deposits with an Sn content of 0.25% exhibited cracks distributed along the grain boundaries. The addition of Sn significantly increased the density of the θ' phase, which was diffused and uniform in size; with an increase in the Sn content, the distribution density of the θ' phase in the deposits first increased and then decreased as the peak-aging condition was reached. The addition of Sn could effectively improve the mechanical properties of the deposits, which first increased and then decreased with an increase in the Sn content. The mechanical properties of the deposits were optimal at an Sn content of 0.1%, with a tensile strength of 493 MPa, yield strength of 434 MPa, and elongation of 9.5%.",

    "abstract": "Due to the stratified construction of additive manufacturing (AM), the building orientation of an object greatly affects the manufacturing process and quality of the products. This article proposes an optimization algorithm for AM that comprehensively covers the three main aspects affected by the building direction: efficiency, surface quality, and internal properties. The goal of optimizing efficiency is to cut the manufacturing and postprocessing times by reducing the support volume. In terms of surface quality optimization, a new and comprehensive mathematical model is established. Considering not only the influence of the stepping effect on the whole model but also the supporting contact area, the optimization to the salient area was innovatively proposed. The salient area was defined by cone curvature, which has a significant influence on appearance. Another novel point is the quantitative optimization of the internal properties, which is based on the anisotropic characteristics of AM. The mechanical properties are taken into consideration in this article, and other anisotropic properties can be added to the optimization algorithm by using the same method. Afterward, a particle swarm optimization algorithm was adopted to synchronously optimize the targets just cited, according to the degree of importance of each factor for specific applications. The algorithm was implemented to optimize several different cases with different characteristics. Further, the results in the experiments manifested that the models printed in the optimized orientation performed better than the initial models, and the corresponding comprehensive evaluation scores were improved as well, with an optimization range of 70-90%. And the rate of optimization for support volume, surface roughness, salient area roughness, and maximum tensile strength, respectively, reached 20.9%, 57.3%, 59.5%, and 293.0%.",

Here we reported a scalable DLP-based three-dimensional (3D) printing system with scalable resolution and building size, which was used for printing of multiscale hydrogel fractal bionic channels. Scalable printing was achieved by moving the convex lens of the printing system, and thus, each single micromirror of the digital micromirror device chip corresponded to the single-pixel size scaling from 6 to12 μm. Using this system, we were able to use poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate to fabricate a variety of multiscale architectures, such as regular fractal Y-shaped channels, and more irregular and intricate geometries, such as biomimetic capillary vascular networks. Blue and red food dye solutions were able to freely fill all these channels in the scaffolds, from the trunk (>1500 μm in width) to small branch (∼30 μm in width) by capillarity. Cell experiments were carried out to certify the biocompatibility of printed multiscale biomimetic channel networks. This work reveals significant progress in printing multiscale constructs with both large printing size and high precision in scalable DLP-based 3D printing.",

    "abstract": "Organ phantoms are widely used for evaluating medical technologies, training clinical practitioners, as well as surgical planning. In the context of cardiovascular disease, a patient-specific cardiac phantom can play an important role for interventional cardiology procedures. However, phantoms with complicated structures are difficult to fabricate by conventional manufacturing methods. The emergence of three-dimensional (3D) printing with soft materials provides the opportunity to produce phantoms with complex geometries and realistic properties. In this work, the aim was to explore the use of a direct 3D printing technique to produce multimodal imaging cardiac phantoms and to test the physical properties of the new materials used, namely the Poro-Lay series and TangoPlus. The cardiac phantoms were first modeled using real data segmented from a patient chest computer tomography (CT) scan and then printed with the novel materials. They were then tested quantitatively in terms of stiffness and ultrasound (US) acoustic values and qualitatively with US, CT, and magnetic resonance imaging systems. From the stiffness measurements, Lay-fomm 40 had the closest Young's modulus to real myocardium with an error of 29–54%, while TangoPlus had the largest difference. From the US acoustics measurements, Lay-fomm 40 also demonstrated the closest soft tissue-mimicking properties with both the smallest attenuation and impedance differences. Furthermore, the imaging results show that the phantoms are compatible with multiple imaging modalities and thus have potential to be used for interventional procedure simulation and testing of novel interventional devices. In conclusion, direct 3D printing with Poro-Lay and TangoPlus is a promising method for manufacture of multimodal imaging phantoms with complicated structures, especially for soft patient-specific phantoms.",

    "abstract": "Limitations of the traditional manufacturing methods often force engineered components to be made of single material systems. However, this is going through changes due to the advent of additive manufacturing (AM) methods, as the point-by-point consolidation allows for a possible change of the material constitution within a given part domain. This will give rise to a plethora of new material and property options for the designers, where just human perception may fail to realize the full benefits. Automated design tools integrating material choice, dispersion, analysis, and optimization algorithms need to be developed to assist in finding the optimal multi-material dispersion solutions achieving given performance criteria sets. Considering the fact that the multi-material manufacturing systems are only recently coming into use, design solutions targeting optimal placement of multiple materials are not common. This article addresses this gap, evaluating a numerical model integrated with different optimization schemes to find the optimal material solutions achieving certain preset performance criteria such as combinations of natural frequencies in different degrees of freedom. A case study of three different metaheuristic optimization schemes based on genetic algorithms indicates, first, that it is possible to create a beam with six uniformly spaced natural frequencies and to change these frequencies without modifying the structural geometry; and second that the basic genetic algorithm generally outperforms neural net-based alternatives for this problem. This tailoring of the structural resonance spectrum demonstrates that evolutionary computing combined with multi-material AM can be used to unlock previously unavailable structural functionality.",

    "abstract": "Specific ventilation imaging (SVI) is a noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based method for determining the regional distribution of inspired air in the lungs, useful for the assessment of pulmonary function in medical research. This technique works by monitoring the rate of magnetic resonance signal change in response to a series of imposed step changes in inspired oxygen concentration. The current SVI technique requires a complex system of tubes, valves, and electronics that are used to supply and rapidly switch inspired gases while subjects are imaged, which makes the technique difficult to translate into the clinical setting. This report discusses the design and implementation of custom three-dimensional (3D) printed hardware that greatly simplifies SVI measurement of lung function. Several hardware prototypes were modeled using computer-aided design software and printed for evaluation. After finalization of the design, the new delivery system was evaluated based on O2 and N2 concentration step responses and validated against the current SVI protocol. The design performed rapid switching of supplied gas within 250 ms and consistently supplied the desired concentration of O2 during operation. It features a reduction in the number of commercial hardware components, from five to one, and a reduction in the number of gas lines between the operator's room and the scanner room, from four to one, as well as a substantially reduced preparation time from 25 to 5 min. 3D printing is well suited to the design of inexpensive custom MRI compatible hardware, making it particularly useful in imaging-based research.",

We present a patient-specific clubfoot model with rigid foot bones suspended independently in a transparent gel matrix that reveals the internal skeletal structure. Compared to cadavers and prosections, our model is a clean and convenient alternative. It offers continuous visual feedback through the transparent skin layer (ideal for training purposes), can be manufactured at demand and reused, and does not require expensive storage and handling facilities. As opposed to other models, which are either purely rigid or flexible, our model is flexible yet with underlying rigid skeletal structure. We believe it has the highest fidelity to human clubfoot in terms of both anatomical structures and material properties. To make this clubfoot model, the knee-to-toe skeleton was first 3D printed using data segmented from a patient's CT data. Then, ballistic gel was melted and cast over the skeleton to create the transparent and flexible skin layer. The flexibility of this clubfoot model permits its recovery to normal foot shape. In addition, the ability of the gel to be repaired with significant recovery of ductility (2.1 ± 0.4 vs. 3.3 ± 0.2, p < 0.05) enables reuse of the model. Ductility of the finished model can be significantly increased by applying an additional elastic coating (4.3 ± 0.2 vs. 5.2 ± 0.2, p < 0.05). This clubfoot model opens up the possibility of making other high-fidelity models with complex anatomies and/or material structures.",

The prosthesis is designed with a one step surgical process, large cavities for bone tissue ingrowth for greater stability, made of a polyamide six-based material that has an elastic modulus less than skeletal bone, and can be 3D printed for user-specific sizes if needed. The design is an improvement upon the current two-part osseointegrated prosthetics that are composed of a fixture and abutment. This prosthetic requires two invasive surgeries for implantation and is made of titanium, which has an elastic modulus greater than bone. An elastic modulus greater than bone causes stress shielding and over time can cause loosening of the prosthetic. The material was first characterized to establish how percent infill and layer height affected the strength of a printed part. The results showed unique and unexpected results than what would have been predicted. Tension samples showed a stabilization period before failure, and shear samples had a unique parabola curve instead of a linear trend in data. Mechanical results of the new prosthetic design include maximum tensile pullout force of 6568.33 N and 5256.37 N in bending in a simulated implantation environment. The prosthesis can also be seated or torqued between 0.50 Nm and 4.00 Nm before failure occurs for a tight-fitting prosthetic for attachment. The work presented here shows that a 3D printed prosthetic attachment device can be made stronger than bone and how 3D printing can impact the medical field.",

Within this vast array of responsive soft materials, hydrogels receive considerable attention due to their fascinating properties, including biodegradable, self-healing, stimuli-responsive, and large volume transformation. Konjac glucomannan (KGM) is an edible polysaccharide that forms a pH-responsive, self-healing hydrogel when crosslinked with borax, and it is the focus of this study. A novel KGM-Borax ink for three-dimensional (3D) printing of free-form structures and soft robots at room temperature is presented. A complete process from ink preparation to the fabrication of a completely cross-linked part is demonstrated. Print setting parameters, rheological properties of the ink and crosslinked gels were characterized. Print quality was found to be consistent across a wide range of print settings. The minimum line width achieved is 650 μm. Tensile testing was carried out to validate the self-healing capability of the KGM-Borax gel. Results show that KGM-Borax has a high self-healing efficiency of 98%. Self-healing underwater was also demonstrated, a rarity for crosslinked gels. The means to form complex structures via 3D printing, reacting to environmental stimuli and the resilience against damage, make this new KGM-Borax gel a promising candidate for the fabrication of the next generation of soft robots.",

The effects of heat treatment on the microstructural evolution and damping properties of the SLMed Mn–xCu alloys were investigated. The metastable miscibility gap was studied by thermodynamic modeling and microhardness measurement. The results showed that γ-(Mn, Cu) phase with dendritic arm spacing (DAS) of 0.9–1.2 μm was the main constituent phase in the as-SLMed alloys, which was one to two orders of magnitude finer than those of the as-cast samples. Aging at 400–480°C for the Mn–30%Cu or 430°C for Mn–40%Cu alloys can induce spinodal decomposition, martensitic transformation, and α-phase precipitation, whose direct evidence was provided for the first time by transmission electron microscopy and 3D atom probe tomography in the work. The miscibility gap obtained from thermodynamics calculation was basically consistent with the microhardness results for the SLMed Mn–xCu alloys. Solution and aging (SA) treatment can improve the microstructure, tensile and damping properties of the SLMed Mn–xCu alloys more obviously than aging treatment. A 2.3–2.8 and 4.3–4.5 times increase was produced in damping capacity in the aged SLMed and SLMed+SAed Mn–xCu samples, respectively.",

The analysis of the impact of element orientation on the working platform of the machine (3D printer) on the obtained test results (so-called printing direction—Pd) was also taken into account as a key technological parameter of the 3D printing process. Experimental rheological curves were matched with theoretical curves resulting from the application of a five-parameter Maxwell–Wiechert (M-W) model in the case of stress relaxation and a five-parameter Kelvin–Voigt model for creep. Very good matches were achieved, mean coefficients Chi2 = 0.0014 and R2 = 0.9956 for matching the five-parameter M-W model and mean coefficients Chi2 = 0.000006 and R2 = 0.9992 enable recommending the obtained results to be used for various engineering calculations, especially computer simulations. Moreover, the use of relaxation curves can significantly increase the construction capabilities within the design process, which includes the MED610 material.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the effective use of porous pumice powder as an additive in acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS)-based composite materials. The influence of pumice addition on mechanical, thermomechanical, thermal, and physical properties of ABS filaments was reported. Two types of pumice, namely acidic pumice (AP) and basic pumice (BP), were melt compounded with ABS at loading levels of 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% by weight using the melt extrusion preparation method. Composites were shaped into dog bone test specimens by the injection molding process. The physical properties of pumice powders were investigated by particle size analysis and X-ray spectroscopy techniques. Mechanical, thermomechanical, thermal, melt flow, and morphological behaviors of ABS/AP and ABS/BP composite filaments were proposed. According to test results, pumice addition led to an increase in the mechanical response of ABS up to a filling ratio of 10%. Further inclusion of pumice caused sharp reduction due to the possible agglomeration of pumice particles. Composites filled with AP yielded remarkably higher mechanical performance in terms of tensile, impact, and hardness strength compared with BP-loaded composites. According to thermal analyses, ABS exhibited higher thermal stability after incorporation of AP and BP. Pumice addition also resulted in raising the glass transition temperature of ABS. Melt flow index (MFI) findings revealed that addition of two types of pumice led to an opposite trend in the melt flow behavior of ABS filaments. Homogeneous dispersion of pumice particles into the ABS matrix when adding low amounts, as well as reduction in dispersion homogeneity with high amounts, of AP and BP was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs.",

    "abstract": "Successful employment of 3D printing for delivery of therapeutic biomolecules requires protection of their bioactivity on exposure to potentially inactivating conditions. Although intermediary encapsulation of the biomolecules in polymeric particulate delivery vehicles is a promising strategy for this objective, the inclusion of such particles in 3D printing formulations may critically impact the accuracy or precision of 3D printed scaffolds relative to their intended designed architectures, as well as the degradation behavior of both the scaffolds and the included particles. The present work aimed to elucidate the effect of poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) particle size and loading concentration on material accuracy, machine precision, and degradation of 3D printed poly(ɛ-caprolactone)-based scaffolds. Using a main effects analysis, the sizes and loading concentrations of particle delivery vehicles investigated were found to have neither a beneficial nor disadvantageous influence on the metrics of printing quality such as material accuracy and machine precision. Meanwhile, particle loading concentration was determined to influence degradation rate, whereas printing temperature affected the trends in composite weight-average molecular weight. Neither of the two particle-related parameters (concentration nor diameter) was found to exhibit a significant effect on intra-fiber nor inter-fiber porosity. These findings evidence the capacity for controlled loading of particulate delivery vehicles in 3D printed scaffolds while preserving construct accuracy and precision, and with predictable dictation of composite degradation behavior for potential controlled release of encapsulated biomolecules.",

    "abstract": "Photopolymerization-based additive manufacturing requires selectively exposing a feedstock resin to ultraviolet (UV) light, which in digital light processing is achieved either using a digital micromirror device or a digital mask. The minimum tolerances and resolution for a multilayer process are separate for resolution through the Z-axis, looking through the thickness of a printed part, and resolution in the XY-axes, in the plane of the printed layer. The former depends wholly on the rate of attenuation of the incident UV light through the material relative to the mechanical motion of the build layer, while the latter is determined by a two-dimensional pattern of irradiance on the resin formed by the digital micromirror device or the digital mask. The size or the spacing of elements or pixels of this digital mask is frequently given by manufacturers as the \"resolution\" of the device, however, in practice the achievable resolution is first determined by the beam distribution from each pixel. The beam distribution is, as standard, modeled as a two-parameter Gaussian distribution but the key parameters of peak intensity and standard deviation of the beam are hidden to the user and difficult to measure directly. The ability of models based on the Gaussian distribution to correctly predict the polymerization of printed features in the microscale is also typically poor. In this study, we demonstrate an alternative model of beam distribution based on a heavy-tailed Lorentzian model, which is able to more accurately predict small build areas for both positive and negative features. We show a simple calibration method to derive the key space parameters of the beam distribution from measurements of a single-layer printed model. We propose that the standard Gaussian model is insufficient to accurately predict a print outcome as it neglects higher-order terms, such as beam skew and kurtosis, and in particular failing to account for the relatively heavy tails of the beam distribution. Our results demonstrate how the amendments to the beam distribution can avoid errors in microchannel formation, and better estimates of the true XY-axes resolution of the printer. The results can be used as the basis for voxel-based models of print solidification that allow software prediction of the photopolymerization process.",

    "abstract": "A three-dimensional (3D) printing is a robotically controlled state-of-the-art technology that is promising for all branches of engineering with a meritorious emphasis to biomedical engineering. The purpose of 3D printing (3DP) is to create exact superstructures without any framework in a brief period with high reproducibility to create intricate and complex patient-tailored structures for organ regeneration, drug delivery, imaging processes, designing personalized dose-specific tablets, developing 3D models of organs to plan surgery and to understand the pathology of disease, manufacturing cost-effective surgical tools, and fabricating implants and organ substitute devices for prolonging the lives of patients, etc. The formulation of bioinks and programmed G codes help to obtain precise 3D structures, which determines the stability and functioning of the 3D-printed structures. Three-dimensional printing for medical applications is ambitious and challenging but made possible with the culmination of research expertise from various fields. Exploring and expanding 3DP for biomedical and clinical applications can be life-saving solutions. The 3D printers are cost-effective and eco-friendly, as they do not release any toxic pollutants or waste materials that pollute the environment. The sampling requirements and processing parameters are amenable, which further eases the production. This review highlights the role of 3D printers in the health care sector, focusing on their roles in tablet development, imaging techniques, disease model development, and tissue regeneration.",

    "abstract": "As an emerging additive manufacturing technology, inkjet printing has been increasingly applied in microelectronics field. However, due to the impacting and rebounding behaviors of conductive ink droplets impinging onto flat substrates, it is challenging to fabricate conductive lines with desired quality, such as suitable line width and line thickness, and matching resistance when it is used for interconnecting multifarious electronic components if there is not a proper configuration of operating parameters. To address this research gap, this article aims to investigate the effect of process parameters on the quality of conductive lines, including the platform temperature, printing speed, number of layers, and delay time (droplet interarrival time), are selected to conduct a full factorial experiment. First, the approximate parameter ranges for ensuring the continuity of conductive lines are determined. Second, this study analyzes the interactive effect among process parameters on line quality. Third, an artificial neural network (ANN) is constructed to predict the quality of printed lines. Results show that the line width does not increase with an increased number of layers, while the line thickness shows an increasing trend. The low resistance and high aspect ratio of printed line are achieved by printing 5 layers with the platform temperature of 70°C, the delay time of 12.2 ms, and the printing speed of 1139.39 mm/min. Moreover, the ANN model can be used to predict line width and line thickness with excellent performance, except for the resistance due to the irregular line edge. This study provides a useful guide for the selection of appropriate printing parameters to realize a diverse range of quality properties for 3D printed conductive lines in integrated circuits.",

Sensitivity to moisture is dependent on material properties and environmental factors and needs characterization. In this article, moisture sensitivity of four grades of polylactic acid (PLA) filaments and four different ratios of PLA/polybutylene succinate (PBS) blended filaments were characterized through FDM printed American society for testing and materials (ASTM-D638) test samples after conditioning the filaments at different relative humidity levels. The tensile testing and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the samples' fracture surfaces revealed that PLA 4043D was the most moisture-sensitive among the chosen grades of PLA filaments. Through filament tension test and melt flow index (MFI) testing it was observed that moisture had a significant detrimental effect (20% reduction in tensile strength and 50% increase in MFI) on PLA 4043D filaments. Samples from moisture-conditioned PLA/PBS 75/25 blended filaments displayed a significant reduction (10%) in tensile strength. Moreover, the MFI of 75/25 filaments was increased with subsequent increases in moisture level. Investigation of tensile properties of ASTM samples made from four grades of PLA filaments exposed to room temperature and humidity conditions for 3 months showed an even more significant decrease in strength (ranging from 24% to 36%).",

    "abstract": "Powder bed fusion with a laser beam (PBF-LB) is a widely used metal additive manufacturing method for fabricating complex three-dimensional components with a variety of metallic powders. However, metal parts fabricated by PBF-LB often present surface quality problems because of the layer-wise building process and the occurrence of partially unmelted powder particles. To reduce the surface roughness, surface post-processing is required, which incurs additional time and cost. In particular, the downskin surface generally has the worst surface roughness among the fabricated components. The rough surface reduces the lifetime and quality of the holed part owing to cracks, corrosion, and wear. In this study, for fast and efficient improvement of the downskin surface roughness of CM247LC fabricated by PBF-LB, machine learning algorithms, namely support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and multilayer perceptron (MLP), were introduced to predict downskin surface roughness in the process parameter selection step. Three PBF-LB process parameters (laser power, scanning speed, and hatching distance) and the overhang angle were selected as the input variables for the machine learning models for predicting downskin surface roughness. Test samples were prepared and used for training and evaluation of the proposed machine learning algorithms, with RF showing the most promising results. Early results were confirmed when model predictions were compared to the actual measured roughness of a fabricated vane part, with average deviations of 13.7%, 4.3%, and 22.5% observed for SVR, RF, and MLP, respectively. The results showed that the proposed machine learning models could accurately predict the downskin surface roughness in the process parameter selection step without the use of any sensor, with RF showing the highest prediction accuracy.",

    "abstract": "A high incidence of ureteral diseases was needed to find better treatments such as implanting ureteral stents. The existing ureteral stents produced a series of complications such as bacterial infection and biofilm after implantation. The fused deposition modeling (FDM) of 3D printing biodegradable antibacterial ureteral stents had gradually become the trend of clinical treatment. But it was necessary to optimize the FDM 3D printing parameters of biodegradable bacteriostatic materials to improve the precision and performance of manufacturing. In this study, polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA), polycaprolactone (PCL), and nanosilver (AgNP) were mixed by the physical blending method, and the 3D printing parameters and properties were studied. The relationship between printing parameters and printing errors was obtained by single-factor variable method and linear fitting. The performance of 3D printing samples was obtained through infrared spectrum detection, molecular weight detection, and mechanical testing. The printing temperature and the printing pressure were proportional to the printing error, and the printing speed was inversely proportional to the printing error. The 3D printing has little effect on the functional groups and molecular weights of biodegradable antibacterial materials. The addition of AgNP increases the compressive strength and breaking strength by 8.332% and 37.726%, which provided ideas for regulating the mechanical properties. The parameter range of biodegradable bacteriostatic materials for thermal melting 3D printing was precisely established by optimizing the parameters of printing temperature, printing pressure, and printing speed, which would be further applied to the advanced manufacturing of biodegradable implant interventional medical devices.",

    "abstract": "Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) enables the fabrication of intricate, geometrically complex structures with a sufficiently fine surface finish for many engineering applications with a diversity of available feedstock metals. However, the production rate of LPBF systems is not well suited for mass production in comparison to traditional manufacturing methods. LPBF systems measure their deposition rates in 100's of grams per hour, while other processes measure in kilograms per hour or even in the case of processes such as forming, stamping, and casting, 100's of kilograms per hour. To be widely adopted in industry for mass production, LPBF requires a new scalable architecture that enables many orders of magnitude improvement in deposition rate, while maintaining the geometry freedom of additive manufacturing. This article explores concepts that could achieve as much as four orders of magnitude increase in the production rate through the application of (1) rotary table kinematic arrangements; (2) a dramatic number of simultaneously operating lasers; (3) reductions of laser optic size; (4) improved scanning techniques; and (5) an optimization of toroidal build plate size. To theoretically demonstrate the possibilities of production improvements, a productivity analysis is proposed for synchronous reluctance motors with relevance to the electric vehicle industry, given the recent increase in the diversity of printable soft magnetic alloys. The analysis provides insights into the impact of the architecture and process parameters necessary to optimize rotary powder bed fusion for mass production.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing is advantageous for producing lightweight components while addressing complex design requirements. This capability has been bolstered by the introduction of unit lattice cells and the gradation of those cells. In cases where loading varies throughout a part, it may be beneficial to use multiple, distinct lattice cell types, resulting in multi-lattice structures. In such structures, abrupt transitions between unit cell topologies may cause stress concentrations, making the boundary between unit cell types a primary failure point. Thus, these regions require careful design to ensure the overall functionality of the part. Although computational design approaches have been proposed, smooth transition regions are still difficult to achieve, especially between lattices of drastically different topologies. This work demonstrates and assesses a method for using variational autoencoders to automate the creation of transitional lattice cells, examining the factors that contribute to smooth transitions. Through computational experimentation, it was found that the smoothness of transition regions was strongly predicted by how closely the endpoints were in the latent space, whereas the number of transition intervals was not a sole predictor.",

    "abstract": "Fused deposition modeling deposits a filament layer by layer and according to a trajectory. Based on stress criterion for filament deposition, this work suggests reproducing the principal directions of the stress in the sample through the control of the filament direction. A number of compact-tension (C-T) specimens have been printed with and without respecting this criterion. The fracture toughness test of these specimens was realized to compare the results. The results show that the suggested criterion leads to an improvement of 30% in the fracture toughness. Digital images correlation has been extensively used to study the local strain field in the specimens. Strain mapping reveals an important change in fracture behavior. The modification of filament direction leads to \"ductile-like behavior\" in crack extension, which is characterized by a large deformation zone associated with a slow crack growth rate during crack propagation.",

In DIW process, writing a trace with desired geometry is of fundamental importance to fabricate a three-dimensional model. In this article, a normalized geometry modeling method with bulge-free analysis for process planning in DIW is presented. The geometry prediction model is developed by converting conventional dispensing parameters to a dimensionless variable, speed ratio v*. The developed model is independent of tip gauge and feeding mechanism. To address the common bulge issue in DIW of low-viscosity fluids, the critical bulge-free printing range has been identified by characterizing the bulge formation process. The developed geometry prediction model and the identified bulge-free printing range are validated by experimental data of several different tips and inks. Finally, a DIW process planning method based on the developed geometry prediction model is demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "Electrical stimulation of mammalian cells in vitro, including stem or neuronal cells and myocytes, has been a widely established method for assessing physiological or pathophysiological mechanisms in a variety of fields of research. Conventional infrastructure used in in vitro electrical stimulation experiments is typically proprietary, noncustomizable, costly, and requires a high level of skill to use and maintain. The emergence of rapid prototyping technology makes it possible to quickly engineer alternatives to conventional stimulation infrastructure that are open source, customizable, low cost, and user friendly. In this study, we describe the rapid prototype of a three-dimensional (3D)-printed reusable growth chamber with integrated electrodes for electrical stimulation and parallel microscopic evaluation of cultured cells that can easily be reconstructed within a few hours using 3D desktop printing and off-the-shelf components. The chamber is light weight (∼8 g), small (76 × 26 × 6 mm), and extremely low cost (<EUR 1). We demonstrate the applicability of the printed device for maintenance of in vitro cultures as well as for electrical and chemical stimulation using the conditionally immortal dorsal root ganglia cell line MED17.11 as a model system. The applicability for microscopic evaluation was demonstrated by time-resolved high-content imaging of the intracellular calcium concentration as a measure of stimulation-induced membrane depolarization. We provide a comprehensive parts list, 3D design files, a wiring diagram, and software code for rebuilding the cost-effective infrastructure for electrical and/or chemical stimulation and parallel high-content microscopy of cells in vitro. While this work focuses on electrical stimulation of mammalian cells, the presented technology could also be adapted for use with other biological specimens and provides a general example of rapidly prototyped low-cost biotechnology for application in life sciences and education.",

These muscles are normally made of two essential parts: an elastomeric bladder and braided sleeve. To date, the braided sleeves used in manufacturing conventional McKibben artificial muscles are made with industrial braiding machines. In this study, we investigate an alternative method to manufacture braided sleeves using a three-dimensional (3D) printing technique. The 3D printing allows for more versatility in controlling the geometry and the structure of the braids. To this end, two structurally different kinds of braided sleeves with connected and disconnected junction points were manufactured. Both kinds of 3D printed braided sleeves were made with similar geometry. The hydraulic McKibben muscle made using the 3D braided sleeves with disconnected junction points was able to generate isometric forces up to 960 mN (53 kPa), actuation strains up to 6.7%, and power per mass of 0.032 W/kg in ∼1 s at a supply water pressure of 0.66 bar. This unique 3D printing technique is simple, fast, and accurate that can be easily modified to fabricate tools for small robotic systems where custom manufacturing is required.",

However, X-ray tomography allows a much higher density of surface data than traditional surface scanners or coordinate measurement machines. In addition to this surface data, internal features can be visualized and quantified, such as macroporosity (purposely left space to save on printing cost), microporosity (space between insufficiently fused lines as well as internal porosity within the print line), and internal inclusions. Advanced dimensional measurements for quality control purposes are also possible, as well as part-to-CAD variance analysis. It is envisaged that such analyses will be particularly useful to validate the dimensional accuracy and assess the quality of products built with new printers or new filament types.",

The scaffolds were fabricated using a novel melt electrospinning technique capable of constructing 3D lattices of layered polymer fibers with well-defined internal microarchitectures. The general morphology and structure order was then determined using T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and X-ray microcomputed tomography. Diffusion tensor microimaging was used to measure the time-dependent diffusivity and diffusion anisotropy within the scaffolds. The measured diffusion tensors were anisotropic and consistent with the cross-hatched geometry of the scaffolds: diffusion was least restricted in the direction perpendicular to the fiber layers. The results demonstrate that the cross-hatched scaffold structure preferentially promotes molecular transport vertically through the layers (z-axis), with more restricted diffusion in the directions of the fiber layers (x–y plane). Diffusivity in the x–y plane was observed to be invariant to the fiber thickness. The characteristic pore size of the fiber scaffolds can be probed by sampling the diffusion tensor at multiple diffusion times. Prospective application of diffusion tensor imaging for the real-time monitoring of tissue maturation and nutrient transport pathways within tissue engineering scaffolds is discussed.",

Four target quality parameters and seven factors were chosen to be examined experimentally. A set of hypotheses for cause-and-effect relationships was derived from the evaluation of the 3D-printing system, prior to the experiments being executed. A model was determined from the significant correlations to generate optimum sets of parameters. Five samples of two different 3D objects each were printed for two sets of optimization plots to validate the optimized parameter settings. The accuracy of the model predictions was evaluated in regard to the general applicability of the process model toward finding optimum process parameters. The results indicate that predictions from experimental process models of 3D printers remain mostly valid if they are used to predict target values for different 3D objects. A deviation of 7–9% was observed in the prediction of the surface quality. It can be concluded that a combination of the experimental model with existing expert knowledge and physical correlations in an advanced gray-box process model could enhance the accuracy and applicability of the experimental results.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) is evolving toward multimaterial processes for improved functionality and performance. A recently developed AMF format provides the platforms for digitizing multimaterial/feature model suitable for AM processes. However, the current build strategies of monomaterial may not be appropriate for multimaterial objects presented in AMF format. The internal architecture of the part cannot be ignored in heterogeneous solids and functional porous objects. The material deposition path-plan in such multifeature objects can be interrupted by frequent directional changes and/or secondary material source activation. Dealing with these interruptions during fabrication requires more resources and may affect the part integrity, quality, and build time. This research aims to minimize such interruptions by focusing on build direction. A computational algorithm is proposed for the heterogeneous object that quantifies the build direction considering the feature characteristics and manufacturing attributes in order to bundle the slices based on the heterogeneity. The proposed methodology is illustrated by two heterogeneous models and generates more than 42% homogeneous slices generated for both examples. Higher heterogeneity is consolidated in strips that may require more resources during fabrication. Thus, differentiating and bundling the slice based on the resources requirement would certainly benefit the process plan for the multimaterial additive manufacturing technique.",

Finite element analysis was conducted about the strain and stress on struts of different dimensions. Results showed that morphology dominated the deformation. The significant factors affecting the deformation were the strut aspect ratio, and their relative diameter. When the aspect ratio of a strut is smaller than 0.5, the plastic deformation is distributed in the subsurface region and when it is larger than 0.5, the deformation concentrates on the top layer of struts.

Compact tension (CT) specimens, both plain and fiber reinforced, were produced and tested systematically. The results showed a significant improvement in fracture toughness for fiber-reinforced specimens when compared with plain ones. The positioning of fiber bundles had a substantial effect on fracture properties, and a higher fracture toughness was reported for specimens with the fiber bundle placed closer to the crack tip. By increasing the number of fiber bundles, a significant increase in fracture toughness was reported when compared with the sample with a single fiber bundle, indicating a strong contribution of fiber volume. Also, the contribution appeared to be most effective when the fiber bundles were placed symmetrically in the thickness direction. The study is of importance and value for the development of the stereolithography technique in manufacturing continuous fiber-reinforced composites with enhanced mechanical properties.",

    "abstract": "Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is an additive manufacturing process where a thermoplastic polymeric material, provided in the form of a filament, is extruded to create layers. Achieving a consistent flow of the extruded material is key to ensure quality of the final part. Extrudate flow depends on many factors; among these, the rate at which the filament is fed into the extruder. In a conventional FFF machine, filament transport is achieved through the use of a drive gear. However, slippage between the gear and the filament may occur, leading to reduced transport and the consequent local decrease of extrudate flow rate, which in turn leads to a series of imperfections in the fabricated part due to underextrusion, including reduced density. In this work, we propose a closed-loop control system to ensure the correct filament transport to the extruder. The system works through the comparison between the nominal transport of the filament and the actual filament transport measured using an encoder. The measured value is used to correct the filament feed rate in real time, ensuring a material flow close to the nominal one, regardless of the other process parameters. In this work, an instrumented FFF machine prototype was used to investigate the performance of the approach. For validation, parts were realized using different process parameters, while enabling and disabling the closed-loop control system. Results showed that the relative filament transport error decreased from up to 9% to below 0.25% and a density increase up to ∼10% regardless of the process parameters, as well as the reduction of interlayer and intralayer voids, as highlighted through cross-sectional imaging of realized samples. A reduction of defects on realized parts was observed, especially at higher fabrication feed rates.",

New research, described here, uses under-the-surface taggant layers, detectable using portable chemical analyzers such as spectrometers. This under-the-skin tagging represents a substantial advance in security. The tagging in layers also represents a considerable advance over simply mixing a taggant chemical into a single printing medium since it makes possible a much larger number of tag options. The ability of UV-cured commodity chemicals to apply and adhere to a wide range of materials and remain undetectable in the visible spectral region is a key enabler of the technology. The near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum has been shown to be useful for distinguishing specific regions of absorption of the tagging compounds not present in the substrate. This property is what makes the selected compounds particularly effective as covert taggants: the human eye cannot detect their presence, but the spectrometer can.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) printing has a variety of applications, from efficient iterations of engineering designs to fabrication of tissues for regenerative medicine. In soft robotics, 3D-printed functional materials can be used to mimic biological functions. Soft robotics overcomes some of the limitations of traditional rigid-body robotics through the ability to conform to different shapes and to be pneumatically controlled. Although soft robotics has been studied extensively by curing elastomers, 3D printing of flexible soft robotic components remains a challenge. Thus, we propose a method to easily fabricate a soft robotic device by using a stereolithography-based 3D printer and a flexible resin. Here, we have designed a device with a soft material composition, a pneumatic control device, and an integrated touch-based sensor to actuate a grasping motion in response to an object coming in close proximity to the sensor, mimicking the natural motion of a carnivorous plant. Characterization of the geometric and kinematic features of the plant leaves shows the dependence of the plant leaves' opening and closing motion on the touch signal provided. In the future, such soft hybrid robotic structures can be useful for biosensing, smart clothes, prosthetic designs, and other soft robotics applications.",

    "abstract": "A prominent obstacle in scaling up tissue engineering technologies for human applications is engineering an adequate supply of oxygen and nutrients throughout artificial tissues. Sugar glass has emerged as a promising 3D-printable, sacrificial material that can be used to embed perfusable networks within cell-laden matrices to improve mass transfer. To characterize and optimize a previously published sugar ink, we investigated the effects of sucrose, glucose, and dextran concentration on the glass transition temperature (Tg), printability, and stability of 3D-printed sugar glass constructs. We identified a sucrose ink formulation with a significantly higher Tg (40.0 ± 0.9°C) than the original formulation (sucrose-glucose blend, Tg = 26.2 ± 0.4°C), which demonstrated a pronounced improvement in printability, resistance to bending, and final print stability, all without changing dissolution kinetics and decomposition temperature. This formulation allowed printing of 10-cm-long horizontal cantilever filaments, which can enable the printing of complex vascular segments along the x-, y-, and z-axes without the need for supporting structures. Vascular templates with a single inlet and outlet branching into nine channels were 3D printed using the improved formulation and subsequently used to generate perfusable alginate constructs. The printed lattice showed high fidelity with respect to the input geometry, although with some channel deformation after alginate casting and gelation-likely due to alginate swelling. Compared with avascular controls, no significant acute cytotoxicity was noted when casting pancreatic beta cell-laden alginate constructs around improved ink filaments, whereas a significant decrease in cell viability was observed with the original ink. The improved formulation lends more flexibility to sugar glass 3D printing by facilitating the fabrication of larger, more complex, and more stable sacrificial networks. Rigorous characterization and optimization methods for improving sacrificial inks may facilitate the fabrication of functional cellular constructs for tissue engineering, cellular biology, and other biomedical applications.",

Multilayer deposition causes heat accumulation during WAAM, which rises the preheat temperature of the previously created layer. This leads to process instabilities, which result in deviations from the desired dimensions and mechanical properties changes. During WAAM deposition of the wall structure, a systematic research is carried out by adjusting the interlayer delay from 10 to 30 s. When the delay period is increased from 10 to 30 s, the breadth decreases by 45% and the height increases by 33%. Grain refinement occurs when the interlayer delay duration is increased, resulting in better hardness, phase transformation temperature, compressive strength, and shape recovery behavior. This study shows how the interlayer delay affects the behavior of WAAM-built nickel-titanium alloy (NiTi) structures in a variety of applications.",

Differences in the scales of organization related to unique organs require special attention to capture fine features critical to surgical procedures.

Most importantly, a new design strategy was proposed to suppress the generation of cracks, and the optimization of the preparation process was also studied in detail. It is found that the interlaminar crack is related to the heat input at the edge of the specimen, and the internal cracks are formed by solidification cracks. Alloys without interlaminar crack can be prepared by means of combination of the side inclination angle and the process parameters. Side inclination angle optimization provides a possibility for the preparation of crack-free AlCoCrFeNi HEA by SLM.",

The scientific literature include works reporting various manufacturing parameters' influence on changes in additive manufacturing components' mechanical behavior, especially with fused filament fabrication (FFF). The changes in mechanical strength and toughness of FFF compared to injection molding parts were studied. In the study, the FFF and injection molded parts were aged in buffered saline solution in temperature of 37°C. The results show that by differentiating the orientation of the fibers during fabricating, it is possible to reach strength values similar to injection molded parts. Therefore, it was reported that the mechanical strength and toughness changed significantly after aging, and the FFF components lost strength more quickly than their injected alternatives. The research results can be useful during the fabrication of mechanically stable and biodegradable components, which can be more easily recycled than their injected alternatives when used with warmer temperatures and humidity.

Based on solid isotropic material with penalty topology optimization method, novel optimized structures are designed, including pure solid structure, pure lattice structure, and solid-lattice hybrid structure with iso-density or variable-density. All experimental samples with few 3D-printing defects are fabricated by selective laser sintering additive manufacturing method. Both three-point bending test and finite element simulation are conducted to evaluate the mechanical behaviors, including force-displacement curves and failure modes. Results show that hybrid structure with variable-density lattice has the highest peak force, while the pure lattice fails at the largest displacement which presents high energy absorption. The stress concentrations at the topology-optimized solid region are significantly alleviated by the support of the distributed lattice. It is illustrated that the reasonable lattice distribution around the topology-optimized solid region to increase the structural efficiency is mainly responsible for the obvious improvements. Furthermore, the solid-lattice hybridization-based topology optimization method is applied to the automotive crash beams, and simulations are performed to verify the effectiveness of method. This method provides valuable guidance for lightweight design of high-performance complex structures.",

Here in this work, the alkalized straw fibers were introduced into the 3D printed cementitious composite to investigate their effect on the properties of the printed composite. The flowability, buildability, and mechanical strengths of the printed composite were tested, and the internal pore distribution was analyzed by X-ray computed tomography. In addition, the straw fibers and printed specimens were tested by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Results showed that, with the increase of straw-fiber content, the flowability of the composites gradually decreased, and the buildability and mechanical strengths first decreased and then increased. Alkaline treatment can improve the crystallinity of cellulose in straw fibers, reduce water absorption, and enhance the bonding performance with the mortar interface. Therefore, compared with the natural-straw-fiber group, the flowability, buildability, and mechanical properties of the alkalized-straw-fiber composites were improved. Specifically, when the content of alkalized straw fiber was 0.4%, the 28 days flexural strength of the fiber alkalized group increased by about 12.6% compared with the natural-straw-fiber group. Microscopically, alkaline straw fibers have better energy absorption and load transfer capabilities inside the composite material, enhancing the toughness of the specimen. Overall, the incorporation of alkalized straw fibers into 3D printed cementitious composites showed better printing, mechanical, and environmental benefits.",

Tests on printability, green strength at varying curing times, hardened mechanical properties, and characterization of the microstructure were conducted. The results demonstrate that the incorporation of MS into 3DPC produces an increase in fluidity and a reduction in unconfined compressive strength. Incorporation of MS enhanced the flexural strength of 3DPC along the printing direction, that is, the interlayer bonding strength, while decreasing its compressive anisotropy from 0.81 to 0.29.

Details for fabricating seamless, tubular elastomeric membranes by spray deposition on a double-curved air-permeable mandrel are presented in Part I. The mandrels are created by casting gypsum into a desired form, and they are made permeable by applying pressurized air to the central core of the gypsum body during its crystallization phase. The membranes—in this case made from silicone—are created by spray deposition onto the mandrel by using a constant surface angular velocity approach. These membranes are inflated so as to impart mechanical pre-strain in the rubber by stretching. The techniques described are particularly suited to the fabrication of 3D printed pneumatic artificial muscles and dielectric elastomer actuators. They can also be used to create removable substrates on which a 3D print can be extruded, or alternatively integrated into a four-dimensional print where varying levels of mechanical strain can be distributed through the various printed layers. Uses for the techniques described include soft robotics, stretchable electronics, biomechanical implants, and custom bioreactors, particularly when combined with direct ink writing techniques.",

Tensile specimens manufactured according to standard ASTM E8 using additive manufacturing were grown at different orientations so as to realize their effect on the overall microstructural integrity. The 40-μm-thick parts were manufactured using a 500 W laser beam to sinter the powder in a vacuum and nitrogen atmosphere. Melt pools were controlled by limiting the laser intensity to 65% and the focal length range was adjusted between 3.4 and 4.6 mm to control the induced spark and reduce oversintering of the powdered layer. The tensile properties and density as well as micro- and macrohardness for the manufactured samples have been measured and analyzed. Furthermore, microstructural analysis of the undeformed and fracture surfaces of the layered 17-4PH stainless steel made by the DMLS process was conducted by means of X-ray diffraction, optical microscopy, and scanning electron microscope. Moreover, a comparative analysis with traditionally manufactured samples was carried out to set a benchmark for the use of additively manufactured stainless steel. The horizontally grown tensile specimens seemed to yield better results than diagonally grown specimens; however, the wrought specimens seemed to supersede both in terms of mechanical properties.",

    "abstract": "The development of three-dimensional (3D) patterned Cu-based composites with Al2O3 matrix has significant potential for an array of uses in industrial applications ranging from aerospace to catalysis. However, to date, it was not possible to fabricate complex structures of these composites by applying conventional techniques. The 3D printing technique makes it possible to control the interconnectivity and porosity of printed materials such as ceramics, metals polymers, or composites. In this work, the 3D printing technique is used to fabricate 3D CuO/Al2O3 composites with complex geometries. To that end, Cu/Al2O3 inks were synthesized using copper nitrate as the copper precursor. Initially, the stability of two Al2O3 suspensions containing copper nitrate and copper sulfate was investigated by zeta potential measurements. The results showed that the suspension with copper sulfate possesses low stability, whereas the suspension with copper nitrate increases the stability of the Al2O3 suspension. Therefore, copper nitrate was the copper precursor selected to prepare the Cu/Al2O3 inks. Rheological tests (steady-state, dynamic oscillatory, and creep–recovery) were performed to investigate the effect of copper nitrate on printability of the ink. The results show that Cu-based inks have higher viscosity, yield stress, and elasticity than pure Al2O3 ink. Finally, complex composite structures were fabricated by 3D printing, and then consolidated by thermal sintering at 1400°C for 2 h in air. Characterization of crystalline phases, morphology, and distribution of Cu in the Al2O3 matrix was performed by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive spectroscopy measurements. The results supplied a simple approach to prepare stable and printable Cu/Al2O3 inks, which can also be used to fabricate periodic structures by 3D printing that should find new promising applications.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing (AM) is gaining increasing interests in modern industries, with its unparalleled capability for direct manufacture of high-value geometrically complex products. With continued technology advancements, plastic AM enables consumer goods to be economically produced in a low to medium production scale. Due to unique AM process characteristics, current design methods that are established based on traditional manufacturing processes are unable to effectively capitalize AM advantages. The traditional designer's mind-set in product design needs changing, which requires new design methods and guidance to be established. However, the majority of the design rules for AM developed so far is primarily on \"feature-level,\" namely, they can only ensure the manufacturability of the designed features in the final design stage. This fails to guide designers throughout the entire design process to exploit full potentials of AM processes. Therefore, this study proposes a design for AM (DfAM) framework to guide industrial/product designers to create an effective design for end-use plastic consumer products for series production. The framework is developed based on a practically proven design practice that is obtained from a series of interviews with professional designers and practitioners with significant experience in DfAM. It summarizes the DfAM principles and addresses major considerations in process selection, design process, and production. This article focuses on illustrating the framework using two detailed case studies showing the real design process for designing two products that are currently being sold on the market. The DfAM principles and considerations in manufacturing process selection, design, and production stages are presented, together with the advantages and disadvantages of the products being designed for AM. It demonstrates the importance of DfAM principles for creating a successful product design.",

    "abstract": "In this study, unique three-dimensional (3D)-printed shape memory biomass composites were prepared by the melt blending and extrusion of polyurethane, polycaprolactone (PCL), and wood flour (WF) with adjustable contents. The addition content of PCL was used to adjust the shape memory transition temperature and improve the shape fixing rate of composites. The crystallization, thermal, mechanical, and shape memory properties of different composites were investigated. The results of X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry tests showed that the crystallization peak and melting temperature of different composites were not obviously changed. As the PCL content increased, the tensile strength of the composites decreased first and then increased, and the elongation at break gradually decreased. Thermal response shape memory test results showed that, when the PCL content was 30 wt.%, the composites had high shape recovery rate and fixed rate (both ∼100%). In addition, carbon black (CB) was added as a photothermal conversion material to the composite with a preferred ratio to achieve the photothermal response shape memory performance. With the addition of CB, the thermal conductivity of composites was improved. Under the same conditions, the thicker the 3D-printed specimens, the longer the specimen shape recovery time; the greater the light intensity, the shorter the specimen shape recovery time. Compared with the composite without CB, the flower model printed with the composites containing CB had a better photothermal response shape memory performance.",

    "abstract": "The System of Rice Intensification (SRI) seeks to increase both the sustainability and the productivity of smallholder rice farms, but the adoption of this methodology is constrained by local access to appropriate mechanical equipment. Valuable information about real difficulties in the adoption of SRI was collected through communications with five field partners. Two primary mechanization obstacles were identified, that is, the availability and performance of a roller component on a push seeder and a rotor component on a push weeder. The potential of additive manufacturing (AM), and especially material extrusion three-dimensional (3D) printing (ME3DP), to assist in overcoming the identified obstacles was assessed for two cases while considering both local prototyping and low-volume production. A simplified cost model was used to compare with the cost of manufacturing both in the United States and locally in the field. The acquired data suggests that in specific cases current ME3DP technology can more rapidly provide functional parts, accelerating the design cycle and lowering cost by about a factor of 10 relative to local fabrication routes. In the case where mechanical performance is critical and dimensional precision and surface finish are not, wire arc metal AM appears promising, but it is not as economical as fabrication by traditional means in the field.",

However, most hydrogels lack mechanical toughness, and shaping them into complicated three-dimensional (3D) structures remains challenging. In the past decade, tough and stretchable double-network hydrogels (DN gels) were developed for tissue engineering, soft robotics, and applications that require a combination of high-energy dissipation and large deformations. Although DN gels were processed into simple shapes by using conventional casting and molding methods, new 3D printing methods have enabled the shaping of DN gels into structurally complex 3D geometries. This review will describe the state-of-art technologies for shaping tough and stretchable DN gels into custom geometries by using conventional molding and casting, extrusion, and optics-based 3D printing, as well as the key challenges and future outlook in this field.",

    "abstract": "Minimizing weight while maintaining strength in components is a continuous struggle within manufacturing industries, especially in aerospace. This study explores how controlling the dimensions of the geometric parameters of a lattice yields ideal mechanical properties for aerospace-related applications. A previously developed Bubble-mesh based computational method was used to generate a novel type of tetrahedral lattice that allows for the manipulation of three geometric parameters: cell size/density, strut diameter, and strut intersection rounding. Topology optimization and lattice generation within components are typical methods used to decrease weight while maintaining strength. Although these are robust optimization methods, each have their faults. Highly topology-optimized components may fail under unexpected loads, and lattice generation within commercial software is often limited in its ability to create ideal lattices with controlled geometric parameters, resulting in lattices with repeating unit cells. In this study, we used finite element methods (FEM)-based compression tests on latticed cubes with various parameter combinations to determine the best balance of lattice parameters. The results showed that strut diameter and strut intersection rounding were the best parameters to control to maintain strength and reduce weight. This understanding of the lattice structures was then applied to two aerospace components: a jet engine bracket and an airplane bearing bracket. By applying tetrahedral lattices with specified strut diameters and strut intersection rounding, the weight of the jet engine bracket was reduced by 51.8%, and the airplane bearing bracket was reduced by 20.5%.",

The different colors and mechanical properties for teeth and the gum base mean a complete denture is manufactured using two materials with different mechanical properties. This study proposes a method to make a complete denture using a laboratory-developed, multiresin additive manufacturing (MRAM) system with two resins and different mechanical properties. A tenon joint is used to create the bottom of the teeth that fit into the gum base, ensuring automatic alignment and higher bending strength. The mechanical properties, material waste, fabrication time, and effect of the tenon joint on the bending strength of a complete denture printed using the MRAM system are compared with the values for a computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) system. Experimental results show that the printed denture is manufactured 3 times faster and produces 14 times less material waste, but is 35.08% less inaccurate than one produced using a CAD/CAM system. The proposed tenon joint increases the bending strength by 31.94%. The MRAM system is applicable for printing a complete denture.",

This work includes advances in digital technology, three-dimensional (3D) printing, advanced geometry, and material practices in arts, crafts, and design disciplines. PolyBrick: Variegated Additive Ceramic Component Manufacturing (ACCM) documents the use of algorithmic design techniques for the digital fabrication and production of nonstandard ceramic brick components for the mortarless assembly and installation of the first fully 3D-printed and fired ceramic brick wall. Techniques in parametric and associative environments are incorporated with feedback derived from material constraints as well as performance assessments. Using customized digital tools, low-cost printing materials, and component-based aggregations, our research utilizes readily available 3D printing technology to develop large-scale forms through the aggregation of interlocking component based systems. Operating within the scalar limitations of current print bed sizes, we developed and tested a set of mass-customized components with embedded local and global awareness and demonstrated that we could achieve forms much larger than previously possible. We have effectively designed a system for mortarless brick assemblies at scales beyond existing constraints of the print bed size of a large-format color printer.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) printable concrete requires cementitious material that must have suitable but self-contradictory properties to be printable such as fluidity to facilitate pumping along with stiffness and strength to ensure buildability, both having a great influence on the cohesion of the interfacial zone. A pool of characterization tests was developed over the last decades for layered 3D printed structures to quantify and qualify the interfacial region. Although destructive tests are typically selected to capture actual interfacial bonding strength, nondestructive testings were also used. Indentation tests were preferred in this study to locally determine the mechanical properties of the center part of two consecutive layers, the edge of the layer and the interfacial zone. As results, it was found that the previously deposited layer is harder than the upper one. The hardness of the edges of the printed filament can decrease ∼50% over few hundred microns compared to the core of the material. Moreover, this decrease in hardness is also observed at the interface. From the hardness-distance profile measured perpendicularly to the plan of the interface, we propose an interfacial weakness criterion, which has been successfully applied in various conditions of 3D printed concrete elaboration.",
