    "abstract": "The concept of carbon neutrality is much emphasized in IPCC Spatial Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C in order to achieve the long-term temperature goals as reflected in Paris Agreement. To keep these goals within reach, peaking the global carbon emissions as soon as possible and achieving carbon neutrality are urgently needed. However, global CO2 emissions continued to grow up to a record high of 43.1 Gt CO2 during 2019, with fossil CO2 emissions of 36.5 Gt CO2 and land-use change emissions of 6.6 Gt CO2. In such case, the global carbon emissions must drop 32 Gt CO2 (7.6% per year) from 2020 to 2030 for the 1.5 °C warming limit, which is even larger than the COVID-induced reduction (6.4%) in global CO2 emissions during 2020. Recently, China has announced scaling up its national commitments, aiming to peak its CO2 emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. Achieving these goals requires rapid and far-reaching transitions in the whole society. On the one hand, deeper emissions reduction in all sectors includes decarbonization of energy, electrification, increasing share of renewables, energy efficiency, sustainable land management, decarbonization of transport, reducing food loss and waste, as well as behavior and lifestyles changes. On the other hand, possible actions by removing CO2 from the atmosphere involves enlarging land and ocean net carbon sink, CO2 removal technologies (such as Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage), and CO2 capture, utilization and storage technologies, but should be caution for their scales and tradeoffs.",

    "abstract": "In this study, projected changes in the future climate conditions for the Middle East–North Africa domain over the 21st century have been investigated. Two simulations with the COSMO-CLM model have been conducted respectively, at a spatial resolution of 0.44° and 0.22°, over the period 1979–2100, employing the IPCC RCP4.5 scenario. Initial and boundary conditions have been derived by the global model CMCC-CM. The main aim of the work is to provide regional climate projections for this area, widening the range of the data already available, yet with higher resolution, useful for many applications, especially as an input for the impact models. The two different resolutions have been employed in order to quantify the differences due to the spatial scale effects, comparing the results also with the driving global model. Climate projections show a significant warming expected over the whole area considered at the end of the 21st century, along with a reduction in precipitation, which is particularly evident over the western part of the domain. Precipitation projections depend on the horizontal resolution, suggesting the need for additional simulations at higher resolution, especially for a proper representation of extreme weather events.",

The results suggest the systematic model biases (cold bias and wet bias) in the Tibetan Plateau still exist in CMIP6. Most models in CMIP6 realistically simulated the surface temperature and spatial distribution of precipitation, with a pattern correlation exceeding 0.75. The bias in the mean surface temperature of the multi-model ensemble (MME) simulation was 1.08 °C lower than the observational data, which had been decreased compared with the cold bias of CMIP5 (1.52 °C). At the seasonal scale, most models exhibited a warm temperature bias in summer and a cold bias in winter. The CMIP6 MME displayed a higher reproducibility of the precipitation amplitude over dry regions compared with CMIP5 and a lower ability over wet regions.",

    "abstract": "Under a warming climate, degrading permafrost profoundly and extensively affects arctic and alpine ecology. However, most existing relevant studies are more focused on the hydrothermal impacts of vegetation on the underlying permafrost, or symbiosis between vegetation and permafrost, only very few on ecological impacts of permafrost degradation. Additionally, there are much more pertinent investigations in arctic and boreal regions than those in alpine and high-plateau regions at mid- and low latitudes. This study emphasizes on the impact mechanisms of permafrost degradation on vegetation both at high and mid-to low latitudes, addressing vegetation succession trajectories and associated changes in soil hydrology and soil nutrient above degrading permafrost. Permafrost degradation influences vegetation by altering soil hydrology, soil biogeochemical processes and microbial communities, which further improve soil nutrient availability. Furthermore, under a warming climate, vegetation may take two successional trajectories, towards a wetter or drier ecosystem within a certain time period, but to a drier ecosystem in the end upon the thaw of permafrost in case of permeable soils and good drainage. Thus, with rapidly developing remote-sensing and other space- and ground-based and air-borne observational networks and numerical predictive models, the impacting mechanisms of permafrost degradation on vegetation should be timely and better monitored, evaluated and modeled at desired spatiotemporal scales and resolutions by terrestrial or integrated ecosystem models.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we conducted a literature review of relevant research and then statistically analyzed global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from natural systems, including forest fires, oceans, wetlands, permafrost, mud volcanoes, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Drawing on the Global Carbon Project (GCP) report, we also summarized the global anthropogenic GHG emissions. We then compared the global annual GHG emissions from natural systems with those generated by human activity. The results indicate that the global annual GHG emissions range approximately between 54.33 and 75.50 Gt CO2-eq, of which natural emissions account for 18.13–39.30 Gt CO2-eq, with the most likely value being approximately 29.07 Gt CO2-eq. According to the GCP report, the global anthropogenic emissions have increased from 22 Gt CO2-eq in 1990 to 36.2 Gt CO2-eq in 2016. The amounts of natural and anthropogenic GHGs emissions are roughly of the same order of magnitude. Anthropogenic emissions account for approximately 55.46% of the total global GHGs emissions (2016 value), i.e., the ratio of natural to anthropogenic emissions is approximately 0.8. In addition, the annual amount of GHGs absorbed by Earth systems (ocean and terrestrial ecosystems) ranges between approximately 14.4 Gt CO2-eq and 26.5 Gt CO2-eq, with natural system GHG emissions and sinks also having roughly the same order of magnitude. This finding indicates that the GHG emissions generated by human activity exert extra pressure on what is otherwise a self-balancing Earth system.",

The analysis results show that during 1901–2014 the annual mean surface air temperature over the whole HKH has undergone a significant increasing trend. We determined the change rates in the mean temperature, mean maximum temperature, and mean minimum temperature to be 0.104 °C per decade, 0.077 °C per decade, and 0.176 °C per decade, respectively. Most parts of the HKH have experienced a warming trend, with the largest increase occurring on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and south of Pakistan. The trend of precipitation for the whole HKH is characterized by a slight decrease during 1901–2014. During 1961–2013, however, the trend of the annual precipitation shows a statistically significant increase, with a rate of 5.28% per decade and has a more rapid increase since the mid-1980s. Most parts of northern India and the northern TP have experienced a strong increase in the number of precipitation days (daily rainfall ≥1 mm), whereas Southwest China and Myanmar have experienced a declining trend in precipitation days. Compared to the trends in precipitation days, the spatial pattern of trends in the precipitation intensity seems to be more closely related to the terrain, and the higher altitude areas have shown more significant upward trends in precipitation intensity during 1961–2013.",

    "abstract": "Northwest China is one of the most arid regions in the world and has experienced intriguing climate warming and humidification. Nonetheless, future climate conditions in Northwest China still remain uncertain. In this study, we applied an ensemble of the 12 latest model simulations of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) to assess future drought conditions until 2099 in Northwest China, as inferred from the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). Future drought conditions were projected under three climate change scenarios through the combination of shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) and representative concentration pathways (RCPs), namely, SSP126 (SSP1 + RCP2.6, a green development pathway), SSP245 (SSP2 + RCP4.5, an intermediate development pathway), and SSP585 (SSP5 + RCP8.5, a high development pathway). For 2015–2099, drought severity showed no trend under SSP126, in contrast, for the SSP245 and SSP585 scenarios, a rapid increase during 2015–2099 was observed, especially under SSP585. We also found that the drought frequency in Northwest China under SSP585 was generally lower than that under SSP126 and SSP245, although the drought duration under SSP585 tended to be longer. These findings suggest the green development pathway in drought mitigation and adaptation strategies in Northwest China, an arid and agricultural region along the Silk Road.",

Permafrost degradation significantly affects forest and vegetation ecosystems, as well as the safety of engineering projects and other man-made infrastructures. However, the permafrost change in the region is still unclear. This study uses metrological data from 258 weather stations, alongside reanalysis data, and other environmental data to investigate permafrost degradation and its related environmental impacts in Northeast China from the 1950s to 2010s. Results show that the total permafrost area decreased from 4.8 × 105 to 3.1 × 105 km2 from the 1950s to the 2010s. The southern limit of permafrost moved 0.1–1.1° northward, and its average elevation rose 160.5 m. During the study period, the degradation of predominantly continuous permafrost, and discontinuous and island permafrost was more pronounced than that of sparsely island permafrost. The south boundary of those three permafrost zones northward by 0–3.4°, 0‒5.5° and 0.4–1.1°, the average altitude raised by 339.2 m, 208.3 m, 67.1 m. The permafrost degradation shows the elevation and latitude zonality. Permafrost degradation is mainly caused by the rising of surface temperatures and the impacts of other environmental factors. The snowfall warming the ground of 1.1–10.2 °C in cold seasons and rainfall cooling on surface conditions in warm seasons, those may result in temporal and spatial differences in permafrost degradation. However, there are lack of researches in the impact of environment factors on soil temperatures, moisture and permafrost degradation.",

    "abstract": "In boreal and arctic regions, forest fires exert great influences on biogeochemical processes, hydrothermal dynamics of the active layer and near-surface permafrost, and subsequent nutrient cycles. In this article, the studies on impacts of forest fires on the permafrost environment are reviewed. These studies indicate that forest fires could result in an irreversible degradation of permafrost, successions of boreal forests, rapid losses of soil carbon stock, and increased hazardous periglacial landforms. After forest fires, soil temperatures rise; active layer thickens; the release of soil carbon and nitrogen enhances, and; vegetation changes from coniferous forests to broad-leaved forests, shrublands or grasslands. It may take decades or even centuries for the fire-disturbed ecosystems and permafrost environment to return to pre-fire conditions, if ever possible. In boreal forest, the thickness of organic layer has a key influence on changes in permafrost and vegetation. In addition, climate warming, change of vegetation, shortening of fire return intervals, and extent of fire range and increasing of fire severity may all modify the change trajectory of the fire-impacted permafrost environment. However, the observations and research on the relationships and interactive mechanisms among the forest fires, vegetation, carbon cycle and permafrost under a changing climate are still inadequate for a systematic impact evaluation. Using the chronosequence approach of evaluating the temporal changes by measuring changes in the permafrost environment at different stages at various sites (possibly representing varied stages of permafrost degradation and modes), multi-source data assimilation and model predictions and simulations should be integrated with the results from long- and short-term field investigations, geophysical investigations and airborne surveys, laboratory testing and remote sensing. Future studies may enable quantitatively assess and predict the feed-back relationship and influence mechanism among organic layer, permafrost and active layer processes, vegetation and soil carbon under a warming climate at desired spatial and temporal scales. The irreversible changes in the boreal and artic forest ecosystem and their ecological and hydrothermal thresholds, such as those induced by forest fires, should be better and systematically studied.",

These RCMs downscaled a subset of atmosphere ocean coupled global climate models (AOGCMs) in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) to higher 50 km spatial resolution over a large domain covering South Asia for two representation concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) future scenarios. The analysis specifically examined and evaluated multi-model and multi-scenario climate change projections over the hilly sub-regions within HKH for the near-future (2036–2065) and far-future (2066–2095) periods. The downscaled multi-RCMs provide relatively better confidence than their driving AOGCMs in projecting the magnitude of seasonal warming for the hilly sub-region within the Karakoram and northwestern Himalaya, with higher projected change of 5.4 °C during winter than of 4.9 °C during summer monsoon season by the end of 21st century under the high-end emissions (RCP8.5) scenario. There is less agreement among these RCMs on the magnitude of the projected warming over the other sub-regions within HKH for both seasons, particularly associated with higher RCM uncertainty for the hilly sub-region within the central Himalaya. The downscaled multi-RCMs show good consensus and low RCM uncertainty in projecting that the summer monsoon precipitation will intensify by about 22% in the hilly sub-region within the southeastern Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau for the far-future period under the RCP8.5 scenario. There is low confidence in the projected changes in the summer monsoon and winter season precipitation over the central Himalaya and in the Karakoram and northwestern Himalaya due to poor consensus and moderate to high RCM uncertainty among the downscaled multi-RCMs. Finally, the RCM related uncertainty is found to be large for the projected changes in seasonal temperature and precipitation over the hilly sub-regions within HKH by the end of this century, suggesting that improving the regional processes and feedbacks in RCMs are essential for narrowing the uncertainty, and for providing more reliable regional climate change projections suitable for impact assessments in HKH region.",

High-altitude regions in the HKH have the recent warming amplifications, especially during the global warming hiatus period. The rapid warming cause solid state water (snow, ice, glacier, and permafrost) to shrink, leading to increase in meltwater and there have been found more frequent incidences of flash floods, landslides, livestock diseases, and other disasters in the HKH region. Increasing awareness of climate change over the HKH region is reached a consensus. Meanwhile, the HKH region is often referred to as the water towers of Asia as many high-altitude regions store its water in the form of snow and/or glacier, feeding ten major large rivers in Asia. Therefore, the impacts of climate change on water availability in these river basins have huge influences on the livelihood of large number of population, especially in downstream regions. However, the scarcity of basic hydro-meteorological observations particularly in high-altitude regions of HKH limits rigorous analysis of climate change. Most studies used reanalysis data and/or model-reconstructed products to explore the spatial and temporal characteristics of hydro-meteorological processes, especially for extreme events.

The research shows that the climate in the region has experienced warming and wetting with the most significant warming in winter and the highest increase in summer precipitation since 1961. Areas with the most significant warming trends include the Qaidam Basin, the Yili River Valley, and Tacheng. Spatially, the increasing trend in precipitation becomes increasingly significant from the southeast to the northwest, and northern Xinjiang experienced the highest increase. Studies have shown a decrease in headwater of Shiyang River because runoff is mainly based on precipitation which shows a decrease trend. But an increase in western rivers was observed such as Tarim River and Shule River as well as Heihe River due to rapid glacier shrinkage and snowmelt as well as precipitation increase in mountain area. Meanwhile unreasonable human activities resulted in decrease of runoff in the middle and lower reaches of Haihe River, Shiyang River and Kaidu River. Finally, recommendations for future studies are suggested that include characteristics of changes in extreme weather events and their impacts on water resources, projections of future climate and water resource changes, climate change attribution, the selection of adaptation strategies relating to climate change and social economic activities, and use of scientific methods to quantitatively determine water resource allocation.",

    "abstract": "Recently, a hot topic about warmer and wetter climate change in the arid region of Northwest China, especially in Xinjiang, has attracted much attention by general public and scientific community. This study revisits this topic especially for Xinjiang in the Eurasian continental context from multiple perspectives based on most updated CRU high-resolution grid data and China's homogenized station data in 1961–2019. We conclude that such 'warming–wetting' trend is not a regional phenomenon for Xinjiang but has much larger spatial scale. Regions having experienced both temperature and precipitation increases reflecting 'warming–wetting' trend account for more than half of the Eurasian continent since 1961. Nevertheless, the 'warming–wetting' trend in Xinjiang suggests some unique regional features in response to the global warming. Although drought seems to have relieved to some extent, especially in the mountainous regions in western Xinjiang, the nature of arid and semi-arid climate regime has not changed. Noticeably, the interannual variability of precipitation has enlarged and the increase in extreme precipitation events has a major contribution. These findings suggest that 'warming–wetting' trend in Xinjiang is asymmetric regarding warming and wetting in seasons and intensifying interannual variability and increasing contribution of extreme precipitation to the total. Thus, the current 'warming–wetting' trend in Xinjiang possibly brings us some beneficial impacts for the ecosystem but also increases challenges for water resources utilization and risk management.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is having a considerable impact on the availability of water resources for agricultural production on the North China Plain (NCP), where the shortage of water is currently disturbing the stability and sustainability of agricultural production with respect to the drying tendency since the 1950s. However, although potential evapotranspiration (ET) has shown a decreasing trend under climate change, actual ET has slightly increased with an acceleration in hydrological cycling. Global climate model (GCM) ensemble projections predict that by the 2050s, the increased crop water demand and intensified ET resulting from global warming will reduce water resources surplus (Precipitation–ET) about 4%–24% and increase significantly the irrigation water demand in crop growth periods. This study assesses possible mitigation and adaptation measures for enabling agricultural sustainability. It is revealed that reducing the sowing area of winter wheat (3.0%–15.9%) in water-limited basins, together with improvement in crop water-use efficiency would effectively mitigate water shortages and intensify the resilience of agricultural systems to climate change.",

Trump will use the withdrawal to build his political reputation and to renegotiate the Paris Agreement despite its negative effects on the political credibility, international relationships, and potential long-term economic growth of the U.S. In general, the withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris Agreement will not change the development of low-carbon technologies and the transformation trend of the global climate governance regime. However, the long-term goals and international cooperation on climate change will be affected by budget cuts in American climate change research and the cancelation of donations from the multilateral environmental fund of the U.S. If the Paris Agreement is renegotiated, the common but differentiated principle of responsibility of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will be challenged again. Nevertheless, climate change governance remains a main theme of future sustainable development. Instead of national governments, local governments and non-governmental organizations will develop strategies for technical innovation and emphasize pragmatic cooperation, thus expanding their roles in climate change governance. The capacity building on climate change research and public awareness should be enhanced as a long-term objective of global climate change governance.",

Some indices were ranked at the second or third place since 1961, including annual maxima of daily maximum temperature (TXx) and of daily minimum temperature (TNx), warm nights (TN90p), frost days (FD), icing days (ID), summer days (SU), and growing season length (GSL). Other extreme temperature indices were ranked in the top 10 since 1961.

The effects of urbanization on local climate trends have been re-estimated based on homogenized observations and using improved methods. In this respect, the effect of urbanization on the observed warming trend of local surface air temperatures during the last few decades is determined as being about 20% at urban stations such as the Beijing Observatory. The large-scale weakening trend of wind speed is also about 20% more prominent at the city center than its surroundings. The effect of urbanization on precipitation is not profound, but results of high-resolution regional climate modeling suggest that this effect may depend on the urban extent. Although the urban heat island (UHI) should favor local atmospheric convection and hence precipitation, the increasingly extending urban land-use may reduce precipitation over the urban cluster in North China. It is found that urbanization can play a more notable role in extreme events than usual weather. High-resolution simulations show a positive feedback between the UHI and the super-heat wave in Shanghai during July–August 2013. Relevant studies dealing with urban climate adaptation are discussed in relation to recent findings.",

However, for climate mitigation and adaption efforts, further studies are still needed to understand the regional consequences between the two global warming limits. Here we provide an assessment of changes in temperature extremes over China (relative to 1986–2005) at 1.5 °C and 2 °C warming levels (relative to 1861–1900) by using the 5th phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) models under three RCP scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5). Results show that the increases in mean temperature and temperature extremes over China are greater than that in global mean temperature. With respect to 1986–2005, the temperature of hottest day (TXx) and coldest night (TNn) are projected to increase about 1/1.6 °C and 1.1/1.8 °C, whereas warm days (TX90p) and warm spell duration (WSDI) will increase about 7.5/13.8% and 15/30 d for the 1.5/2 °C global warming target, respectively. Under an additional 0.5 °C global warming, the projected increases of temperature in warmest day/night and coldest day/night are both more than 0.5 °C across almost the whole China. In Northwest China, Northeast China and the Tibetan Plateau, the projected changes are particularly sensitive to the additional 0.5 °C global warming, for example, multi-model mean increase in coldest day (TXn) and coldest night (TNn) will be about 2 times higher than a change of 0.5 °C global warming. Although the area-averaged changes in temperature extremes are very similar for different scenarios, spatial hotspot still exists, such as in Northwest China and North China, the increases in temperatures are apparently larger in RCP8.5 than that in RCP4.5.",

The withdrawal undercuts the foundation of global climate governance and upsets the process of climate cooperation, and the impacts are manifold. The withdrawal undermines the universality of the Paris Agreement and impairs states' confidence in climate cooperation; it aggravates the leadership deficit in addressing global climate issues and sets a bad precedent for international climate cooperation. The withdrawal reduces other countries' emission space and raises their emission costs, and refusal to contribute to climate aid makes it more difficult for developing countries to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Cutting climate research funding will compromise the quality of future IPCC reports and ultimately undermine the scientific authority of future climate negotiations. China faces mounting pressure from the international community to assume global climate leadership after the U.S. withdraws, and this article proposes that China should reach the high ends of its domestic climate targets under the current Nationally Determined Contributions; internationally, China should facilitate the rebuilding of shared climate leadership, replacing the G2 with C5.

The government has supported the international agreement by setting and strengthening the domestic policy targets for an earlier peak and faster reduction, aiming to contain the average global temperature increase to well below 2 °C. We develop a Kaya Inequality method to assess the time of peak and pace of reduction of China's energy-related CO2 emissions based on the national energy policy targets for 2030. We find that, despite the minor fluctuations, the current plateau essentially represents the peak emissions and should enter a phase of steady decline by around 2025, given current trends in energy consumption and decarbonization. Such developments would be consistent with the strengthened national policy target to achieve 50% of renewable power generation by 2030. However, the basic policy targets – a 20% share of non-fossil energy and 6 Gtce in total energy consumption by 2030 – would be insufficient to peak carbon emissions by around 2030. The synergy and interplay between domestic policy target setting and international climate commitments shed light on the need to elevate national climate ambitions under the Paris Agreement and beyond.",

By using a carbon emission model integrated into a bottom-up mid-to-long term energy consumption model, this study analyzes the contribution of NZEB standards to carbon emission targets in the urban area of China by 2060. Three scenarios are set, namely BAU, steady development (S1), and high-speed development (S2). For BAU, the total carbon emissions will reach a peak of 1.94 Gt CO2 by 2040. In S1 scenario, total building carbon emissions will reach the peak of 1.72 Gt CO2 by 2030. In S2 scenario, the carbon emissions will reach a peak by 2025 with 1.64 Gt CO2. Under S1 scenario, which features consistency with NZEB market development and periodic improvement of building energy-efficiency standards, the carbon emission peak in 2030 will be accomplished. To achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, the upgrading of building energy standards to NZEB will contribute 50.1%, while zero-carbon electricity contribution is 49.9%. It is concluded that 2025, 2030, and 2035 could be set as mandatory enforcement years for ultra-low energy buildings, NZEB and zero energy building (ZEB), respectively.",

Thus, this study aims to analyze the relationships between tourism, coastal areas, the environment, and CC in the context of tourism urbanization; and recommend strategies for enhancing the governance of coastal areas. Three popular destinations were selected as study areas, Koh Chang, Koh Mak, and Pattaya. Group discussions, questionnaire surveys, interviews, and observation were used for primary data collection together with secondary data. The results show that the development of these destinations has been incompatible with the coastal environment and CC patterns. Rapid urbanization from tourism development is the main driver of environmental changes and makes the areas vulnerable to CC-related risks. While water scarcity and pollution are found the most critical environmental issues of the destinations, coastal areas are negatively affected in terms of increased air and water pollution and resource degradation. They have also been exposed to different CC-related problems while the risks of accumulative impacts of both environment and CC have not been adequately recognized or addressed. Although some measures have provided synergies of improved environment and increased climate resilience, possible conflicts and gaps were also found. Public infrastructure integration and optimization to enhance coastal areas' environment and climate resilience are suggested.",

This study used a scoping review method to explore integrated impacts of climate change on glaciers from the academic literature. All reviewed literature included a wide range of both research and non-research-based data or information. All literature was reviewed by summarizing findings of relevant research. It showed that climate warming has led to rapid melting and retreat of glacier landscapes, which has resulted in a huge impact on economic and social systems. The findings indicated that some glacial landscapes are declining in aesthetics or attractiveness while some landscapes face the prospect of sustained decline or even disappearance. This not only affects glacial cultural appreciation or mountain residents' beliefs, but increases the difficulty in entering and experiencing glaciers. Some points of tourism even face the risk of glacial disaster. Rapid glacial retreat or even disappearance will bring a loss of tourism revenues. At present, it is urgent to anticipate and adapt to these integrated impacts. In short, this study provides a general review of the impacts of climate change on glacial tourism and also some references for the adaptation of future glacial tourism to climate change.",

    "abstract": "Evaluation of vegetation structure and distribution simulations in Earth system models (ESMs) is the basis for understanding historical reconstruction and future projection of changes in terrestrial ecosystems, carbon cycle, and climate based on these ESMs. Such assessments can also provide important information of models' merits and shortcomings or systematic biases, and so clues for model development. Vegetation structure and distribution in ESMs are primarily characterized by three variables: leaf area index (LAI), tree height, and fractional coverage of plant functional type (PFT). However, for the ongoing Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), only temporal variabilities of global-averaged LAI time series were evaluated, others remain largely uninvestigated. This study systematically investigates the spatial and/or temporal variability of the three critical variables from 27 ESMs in CMIP6 using satellite observations. Our results show that all models and the multi-model ensemble mean (MME) can generally reproduce the observed LAI spatial pattern but all of them overestimate the global mean LAI mainly due to overestimation of LAI in non-forested vegetated areas. Most CMIP6 models fail to capture the temporal variability in the annual LAI because of large biases in both the simulated trend magnitude and temporal pattern of interannual variability. The average LAI seasonal cycles in different latitude zones are roughly reproduced by the models, but 1–2 months delays in the LAI peak appear in the Arctic-boreal zone. Additionally, CMIP6 models overall overestimate tree height, and largely overestimate the global grass area but underestimate tree and shrub areas, especially in the middle and high latitudes. It should be kept in mind that such biases may have further impacts on the simulations of the related carbon and land–atmosphere interaction variables (e.g., ecosystem production, carbon storage, transpiration, and temperature) for global change research. Hence, bias-correction should be made to improve reliability of vegetation structure and distribution when future projections and historical reconstructions. They also underscore the urgent need in development and parameterization of dynamic vegetation within Earth system models, such as phenology, allocation, and morphology schemes.",

The existing literature highlights the importance of systemic risk induced by climate change, but there are still deficiencies in understanding its dynamics and assessing the risk. Aiming to bridge this gap, this study develops a theoretical framework and employs two cases to illustrate the concept, origin, occurrence, propagation, evolution, and assessment framework of systemic risk induced by climate change. The key findings include: 1) systemic risk induced by climate change derives from the rapid growth of greenhouse gas emissions, increasingly complex connections among different socioeconomic systems, and continuous changes in exposure and vulnerability; 2) systemic risk induced by climate change is a holistic risk generated by the interconnection, interaction, and dynamic evolution of different types of single risks, and its fundamental, defining feature is cascading effects. The extent of risk propagation and its duration depend on the characteristics of the various discrete risks that are connected to make up the systemic risk; 3) impact domains, severity of impact, and probability of occurrences are three core indicators in systemic risk assessment, and the impact domains should include the economy, society, homeland security, human health, and living conditions. We propose to deepen systemic risk research from three aspects: to develop theories to understand the mechanism of systemic risk; to conduct empirical research to assess future risks; and to develop countermeasures to mitigate the risk.",

How and to what extent does the degrading permafrost change the flow in the SAYR? According to seasonal regimes of hydrological processes, the SAYR is divided into four sub-basins with varied permafrost extents to detect impacts of permafrost degradation on the Yellow River streamflow. Results show that permafrost degradation may have released appreciable meltwater for recharging groundwater. The potential release rate of ground-ice melt-water in the Sub-basin 1 (the headwater area of the Yellow River (HAYR), above the Huangheyan hydrological station) is the highest (5.6 mm per year), contributing to 14.4% of the annual Yellow River streamflow at Huangheyan. Seasonal/intra- and annual shifts of streamflow, a possible signal for the marked alteration of hydrological processes by permafrost degradation, is observed in the HAYR, but the shifts are minor in other sub-basins in the SAYR. Improved hydraulic connectivity is expected to occur during and after certain degrees of permafrost degradation. Direct impacts of permafrost degradation on the annual Yellow River streamflow in the SAYR at Tanag, i.e., from the meltwater of ground-ice, is estimated at 4.9% that of the annual Yellow River discharge at Tanag, yet with a high uncertainty, due to neglecting of the improved hydraulic connections from permafrost degradation and the flow generation conditions for the ground-ice meltwater. Enhanced evapotranspiration, substantial weakening of the Southwest China Autumn Rain, and anthropogenic disturbances may largely account for the declined streamflow in the SAYR.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Permafrost presents extensively on the land surface and it is degrading under the combined influences of warming climate and human activities. The degrading permafrost will post profound impacts in hydrology, ecology, engineered infrastructures, and socioeconomic development. In order to better adapt to these changing permafrost environments, we need to better understand permafrost degradation and its impacts, as well as to timely develop predicting capabilities and adaptive strategies and mitigative measures. However, due to the remoteness of permafrost regions, low density of population and observational networks, and paucity of measured data, our understanding on degrading permafrost and its various impacts is still limited. This Special Issue of Degrading Permafrost and Its Impacts, as a proceed of the forthcoming 12 th International Conference on Permafrost, collects seven papers on permafrost environments and engineering in a timely manner, in order to reflect the latest progress in this chosen topic. This Special Issue on Degrading Permafrost aims at facilitating the studies on the adaptive and sustainable development of the permafrost environment and human society under a warming climate.",

Using Chinese listed firms within environment-related industries over the period 2011–2018 as the research setting, this study applies the panel data model to investigate the impact of corporate innovation on environmental investment, as well as the moderating effects of institutional factors. The results show that corporate innovation significantly improves firms' environmental investment with 1% Research & Development (R&D) investment ratio increase generating 2326 CNY (around 351 USD at 2018 exchange rate) increase in environmental investment; the moderating effect of environment policy is positive and significant while the moderating effect of internationalisation level is not significant, indicating that current environment policy implementation helps to strengthen the positive impact of corporate innovation on environmental investment while the role of internationalisation level in this nexus is not observed. From a micro-level perspective, the findings of this study shed light on mitigating environmental concerns through enhancing corporate innovation, and provide evidence that China's corporate internationalisation process awaits more regulatory controls.",

    "abstract": "Collaborative governance between ecological environment and climate change is a novel signature in China's policy agenda. However, such coordination remains understudied, especially at the local level. Using the principal component analysis, entropy evaluation methods, and the Coupling Coordination Degree Model (CCDM), we evaluated the level of coordination between carbon and air quality mitigation from 34 low-carbon pilot cities in China. We also illustrated the mechanism and policy formation that leads to different coupling patterns at the local level using three case studies. We found that most pilot cities perform a medium level of coupling coordination between low carbon development and air quality. The result reveals that most low-carbon pilot cities score relatively well in low-carbon development. Further, there is a significant cleavage in air quality between cities in the North and those in the South, indicating pilot cities in the South coordinate better than those in the North. In particular, pilot programs in the Southwest and Southeast coastal region perform well in collaborative governance, while the Beijing−Tianjin−Hebei region is rated poorly because of the gap between air quality and low carbon development. Also, we found that the same low-carbon policy might have heterogeneous effects on different air pollutants and across different regions. The local government should adopt low-carbon development policies that address local level specific environmental and economic conditions to maximize their air pollution mitigation benefits.",

Based on the HighResMIP's historical simulations of atmospheric general circulation models, the performances of global high-resolution models, with a horizontal resolution finer than 50 km, in representing precipitation over Central Asia were evaluated using rain gauge observation datasets. All the models successfully reproduce the large precipitation regions that are located over the mountainous areas and Northern Central Asia. However, nearly all the models overestimate precipitation frequency over Central Asia and large overestimations of precipitation amount and frequency are located over the mountainous areas. Although the HighResMIP multi-model ensemble mean performs better than all individual models at simulating the spatial pattern of precipitation frequency, it is inferior to HadGEM3-GC31-HM and ECMWF-IFS-HR at simulating that of precipitation amount. The simulation performance exhibits remarkable regional differences. Over the Qilian Mountains, the relationship between precipitation and elevation is totally captured by climate models. In contrast, over the Tianshan Mountains, the models fail to simulate the decrease in precipitation frequency after elevation higher than the maximum precipitation elevation. Most models successfully reproduce the annual cycle shape of precipitation amount over the Southern Central Asia, Qilian Mountains and Tianshan Mountains, but fail to reproduce it over the Northern Central Asia. More than half of the high-resolution GCMs have a reduced bias relative to the corresponding low-resolution GCMs. The performances of most high-resolution GCMs in simulating precipitation pattern are well over the Tianshan Mountains.",

This study developed a new life cycle model of energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on China's HSR by life cycle analysis (LCA), covering the stages of infrastructure, HSR train, and operation, based on the TLCAM (Tsinghua-LCA Model). A case of the Beijing–Shanghai HSR has been studied to show that the full life cycle energy consumption and GHG emissions of HSR transportation are 0.4 MJ km−1 per capita and 0.04 kg CO2e km−1 per capita, respectively, which are far less than aviation, gasoline vehicles, diesel vehicles, electric vehicles and public vehicles. With the cleaner power structure and the progress of HSR train technology, the energy consumption and carbon emissions of HSR in 2020 could be reduced by 20% compared to 2015. This study indicates that electricity generation mix structure and full load rate are important factors influencing the life-cycle energy consumption and GHG emissions of HSR transportation. It is recommended to improve the coverage of HSR network, accelerate train upgrades, improve the full load rate of HSR trains, and promote the low-carbon development of electricity supply to strengthen and realize the low-carbon advantage of HSR transport mode in China. HSR transportation can be used to achieve the low carbon transformation of China's transportation sector and improve oil supply safety situation.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades, changes in temperature, wind, and rainfall patterns of Southeast Asia induced by climate warming in the Tibetan Plateau result in many environmental changes that have serious impacts on the lower reach of the Mekong River basin, a region already battling severe water-related environmental problems such as pollution, saltwater intrusion, and intensified flooding. In the densely populated Mekong Delta located at the mouth of the Mekong River basin in southern Vietnam, the hydrogeological systems have been transformed from an almost undisturbed to a human-impacted state and saltwater intrusion into surface water and groundwater systems has grown to be a detrimental issue recently, seriously threatening freshwater supply and degrading the eco-environment. In this article, the impacts of human activities and climate change (e.g., groundwater over-exploitation, relative sea-level rise, storm surge, changing precipitation and temperature regimes, uncontrolled drainage canals, operation of hydropower dams, and rapid development of aquaculture) on saltwater intrusion into groundwater systems in the Mekong Delta are briefly reviewed. Based on current status of research findings regarding saltwater intrusion and the subsequent groundwater quality degradation under the impacts of human activities and climate change, major knowledge gaps and challenges are identified and discussed, including thickness and permeability of the silt and clay aquitard, present-day highly heterogeneous 3D distribution of saline groundwater zones, dynamic variation of saltwater/freshwater transition zone, and the most effective and economical control measure. To bridge these gaps, future work should: 1) apply environmental isotope techniques in combination with borehole tests to gain detailed hydrogeological information regarding spatial variation of permeability and thickness of the silt and clay aquitard; 2) intensify regular groundwater monitoring and collect as much groundwater samples from multiple hydro-stratigraphic units at different depths as possible to visualize the present-day highly heterogeneous 3D distribution of saline groundwater; 3) develop a series of variable-density coupled groundwater flow and salt transport models representing various scenarios of human activities and climate change for predicting future extent of saltwater intrusion; and 4) identify the dominant factor causing saltwater intrusion and determine the most effective and economical engineering technique to address saltwater intrusion problems in the Mekong Delta.",

    "abstract": "Marine heatwaves (MHWs) have been frequently observed worldwide, causing devastating impacts on marine organisms and ecosystems, but the trend of MHWs is still unclear in the South China Sea (SCS). Here, the long-term trend and inter-annual variability of the summer SCS MHW events are investigated based on the high-resolution daily satellite data. The results revealed remarkable increases in the duration, intensity, coverage, and severity during 1982–2019, indicating that the SCS MHW events have become more frequent, intense, extensive, and serious. The probability ratio of SCS MHW events is four times during the 2010s of that during the 1980s. The increasing trend can be largely attributed to the long-term increase in the mean SCS temperature. The inter-annual variability of the SCS MHWs is linked closely to the El Niño and Southern Oscillation, with more/less MHW events occurring during the following summer after the El Niño/La Niña events. A diagnosis of synoptic-scale heat budget suggests that the extreme SCS warming can be explained by the combined effects of positive surface heat flux largely due to the enhanced shortwave radiation and convergence of oceanic advection in association with an anomalous upper-ocean anticyclone. The effect of surface heat flux seems to be predominant over the large spatial coverage, whereas oceanic heat transport is also important in some specific regions. The large-scale anticyclonic circulation anomalies over the northwestern Pacific accompanying the westward-extending western Pacific subtropical high during the El Niño decay summers play an essential role in the building-up and persistence of the extreme warming, which has important implications for the prediction of the SCS MHWs.",

    "abstract": "China has proposed to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. Although previous studies have assessed net-zero emissions pathways in China, the diversity observed in these studies in terms of model construction and parameter setting has led to inconsistent conclusions on some key issues, such as energy transition. This study employs a multi-model comparison method to examine the significance of China's carbon neutrality target on its energy systems by assessing 67 carbon neutrality scenarios in China that are collected from the ADVANCE database, and identifying the differences between energy transition pathways under BEF60 scenarios (i.e. scenarios realising carbon neutrality by 2060) and AFT60 scenarios (i.e. scenarios realising carbon neutrality after 2060). Results show that China needs a larger deployment of low-carbon electricity, a higher electrification rate and more carbon sequestration amount under BEF60 scenarios than those under AFT60 scenarios. Meanwhile, the magnitude of the difference between the two categories of scenarios varies significantly in terms of different outcome indicators. Those that present significant disparities include the deployment scale of solar power (increasing by 160%), the electrification rate of the building sector (increasing by 27%) and the carbon sequestration amount of biomass power with carbon capture and storage (increasing by 380%). In addition, this study selects six indicators to present the technological and economic characteristics of various energy systems of China at the point of net-zero emissions. Exploring the relationships between characteristics, this research identifies the common features among various net-zero energy systems. A great share of non-biomass renewable power generation is always associated with a relatively high per capita energy use, implying that high renewables penetration may relax restrictions on energy consumption, which should be addressed for China when making efforts to promote energy transition.",

    "abstract": "In 2021, China updated its nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement, which prompts a more accurate measurement of its emissions inventory and a reasonable pathway toward carbon neutrality before 2060. This study reviews the estimates using the bottom-up emissions factor method or the top-down atmospheric CO2 concentration inversion method to derive China's CO2 emissions inventory and finds thatCO2 emissions from energy combustion and industrial processes in Chinese mainland range from 11.3‒12.0 GtCO2. Based on a comprehensive review of pathways proposed by domestic and international studies and an analysis of the origins of their differences, we proposed the Tsinghua-CMA pathway that coordinates the global temperature rise control target with China's currentCO2 emissions status and mitigation policies. The pathway is consistent with the 2 °C target and requires China's CO2 emissions to peak around 2028–2029 at about 12.8 GtCO2, then decline steadily to 11.2 GtCO2 in 2035, 3.6 GtCO2 in 2050, and 0.9 GtCO2 in 2060. Compared to a reference scenario without updated NDCs, this pathway would result in an economic cost of about 0.9% cumulative GDP between 2020 and 2060, only 1/4‒1/3 of the cost associated with pathways that align with the 1.5°C target. We recommended that China improves emissions accounting by cross-validating bottom-up and top-down approaches and regularly updating the pathway toward carbon neutrality while maintaining consistency with its evolving CO2 emissions inventory, policy trends, and global CO2 emission budget updates.",

Nevertheless, the timescale, seasonality and dominant causes of the Tibetan warming amplification have not been discussed. The seasonality of the Tibetan amplification effect at different timescales was revealed in this study. Based on the optimal fingerprinting attribution method, an attribution study of the Tibetan warming amplification was also conducted after selecting the outperforming model simulations in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Results showed that Tibetan warming amplification manifested in the mid-1970s. The annual amplification during 1961–2018 was 0.13°C per decade. The warming amplification in spring started later than all the other seasons, and the strongest warming amplification occurred in winter. The change in Tibetan warming amplification also displayed distinct decadal differences at time scales shorter than 30 years. The updated models perform better in simulating the surface air temperature change on the global land scale whilst underestimating the warming over the Tibetan Plateau region, which causes a weak amplification in the model simulation. Overall, the largest deviation comes from winter. The attribution result reveals that the stronger warming response to human influence on the Tibetan Plateau than the global land is the direct cause of the Tibetan warming amplification. This finding implies the important role of local climate feedback over the Tibetan Plateau.",

    "abstract": "High-Mountain Asia (HMA) shows a remarkable warming tendency and divergent trend of regional precipitation with enhanced meteorological extremes. The rapid thawing of the HMA cryosphere may alter the magnitude and frequency of nature hazards. This study reviews the impact of various types of nature hazards in HMA region, including their phenomena, mechanisms and impacts. It reveals that: 1) the occurrences of extreme rainfall, heavy snowfall, and drifting snow hazards are escalating; accelerated ice and snow melting have advanced the onset and increased the magnitude of snowmelt floods; 2) elevating trigger factors, such as glacier debuttressing and the rapid shift of thermal and hydrological regime of bedrock/snow/ice interface or subsurface, the mass flow hazards including bedrock landslide, snow avalanche, ice-rock avalanches or glacier detachment, and debris flow will become more severe; 3) increased active-layer detachment and retrogressive thaw slumps slope failures, thaw settlement and thermokarst lake will damage many important engineering structures and infrastructure in permafrost region; 4) multi-hazards cascading hazard in HMA, such as the glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) and avalanche-induced mass flow may greatly enlarge the destructive power of the primary hazard by amplifying its volume, mobility, and impact force; and 5) enhanced slope instability and sediment supply in the highland areas could impose remote catastrophic impacts upon lowland regions, and threat hydropower security and future water shortage. In future, ongoing thawing of HMA will profoundly weaken the multiple-phase material of bedrock, ice, water, and soil, and enhance activities of nature hazards. Compounding and cascading hazards of high magnitude will prevail in HMA. As the glacier runoff overpasses the peak water, low flow or droughts in lowland areas downstream of glacierized mountain regions will became more frequent and severe. Addressing escalating hazards in the HMA region requires tackling scientific challenges, including understanding multiscale evolution and formation mechanism of HMA hazard-prone systems, coupling thermo‒hydro‒mechanical processes in multi-phase flows, predicting catastrophes arising from extreme weather and climate events, and comprehending how highland hazards propagate to lowlands due to climate change.",

However, the influence of the timing of extreme drought on the variation of ecosystem WUE under severe water stress has not been studied extensively. In particular, the modulation of drought impacts on WUE under regional hydro-climatic conditions and biome types is poorly understood. Considering observation-based ecosystem flux and drought index datasets, this study examined the impact of extreme seasonal drought on WUE in China and attempted to reveal the underlying drivers of seasonal variations in drought impacts. Results showed that the direction and magnitude of drought impacts on WUE depend on the occurrence time of extreme drought and the seasonal dynamics of regional ecological and climatic conditions. Across the vegetated regions in China, the most widespread reduction in WUE under extreme drought conditions was observed in summer, whereas approximately 60% of the study area showed positive changes in WUE under extreme drought conditions in spring. Furthermore, the co-regulation of drought characteristics and background environmental conditions in determining the impacts of extreme seasonal drought on ecosystem WUE is highlighted. Classification and regression tree analysis results illustrate that leaf area index (LAI) and drought timing dominated ecosystem WUE variation in response to extreme drought in China. Regions with lower LAI experienced more serious reductions in WUE under extreme drought. These findings indicate the importance of accounting for the interaction between drought seasonality and biome features in assessing drought impacts, thus contributing to improving the modelling of terrestrial ecosystem responses to climate extremes under global warming.",

The transient climate responses to the CO2 concentration increase at 1% per year are presented in the simulation of the two models. The BCC_CSM1.1-M result is closer to the CMIP5 multiple models ensemble. The two models perform well in simulating the historical evolution of the surface air temperature, globally and averaged for China. Both models overestimate the global warming and underestimate the warming over China in the 20th century. With higher horizontal resolution, the BCC_CSM1.1-M has a better capability in reproducing the annual evolution of surface air temperature over China. Xin, X.-G., T.-W. Wu, and J.

    "abstract": "Based on a new multi-source dataset (GLDP-V1.0) recently developed in China Meteorological Administration, we employed precipitation indices including percentile-based indices of light (below the 50th percentile), moderate (between the 50th and 90th percentile), and intense (above the 90th percentile) precipitation, maximum 1-day, 3-day, and 5-day precipitation amounts (RX1DAY, RX3DAY, and RX5DAY, respectively), and consecutive wet and dry days (CWDs and CDDs) to analyze variations in extreme precipitation events in the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) during 1961–2012. The main results are presented as follows. Firstly, there was a significant increase in the amount of light and moderate precipitation and number of associated days over various parts of India and northern Tibetan Plateau during 1961–2012; but the intensity of light precipitation decreased significantly in the Hindu Kush and central India, and the regional average intensity also decreased. Secondly, the amount and frequency of intense precipitation mostly increased significantly on the Tibetan Plateau, but there was a heterogeneous change over the remainder of the HKH, and regional average annual intense precipitation amount and frequency significantly increased over the HKH during 1961–2012. Thirdly, regional average RX1DAY, RX3DAY, and RX5DAY all showed significant upward trends during 1961–2012, and there was a significant increased tendency of consecutive wet-days in most parts of the study region; however, trends of consecutive dry-days were mostly opposite to those of consecutive wet-days, with regional averaged consecutive dry-days showing no noticeable trend.",

    "abstract": "This paper reviews the studies and research on climate change impacts on the forest ecosystems in Northeast China. The results show that in the context of global and regional warming, the growing season of coniferous forests has been increasing at an average rate of 3.9 d per decade. Regional warming favors the growth of temperate broad-leaved forests and has a detrimental effect on the growth of boreal coniferous forests. Over the past hundred years, the forest edge of the cool temperate zone in the southern Daxing’anling region has retreated 140 km northward. From 1896 to 1986, the northern boundary of broad-leaved forests in Heilongjiang province has extended northwestward about 290 km. Future climatic changes (until 2060) may lead to the northern deciduous needle forests moving out of China’s territory altogether. The occurrence cycles of pests and diseases have shortened; their distribution ranges have expanded. The life cycle of tent caterpillars (Malacosoma neustria testacea Motschulsky) has shortened from 14–15 years in the past to 8–10 years now. The pine caterpillar (Dendrolimus tabulaeformis Tsai et Liu), which has spread within western Liaoning province and the nearby areas, can now be found in the north and west. Lightning fires in the Daxing’anling region have significantly increased since 1987, and August has become the month when lightning fires occur most frequently. Overall, the net primary productivity (NPP) of forest in Northeast China has increased. The NPP in 1981 was around 0.27 Pg C, and increased to approximately 0.40 Pg C in 2002. With the current climate, the broad-leaved Korean pine forest ecosystem acts as a carbon sink, with a carbon sink capacity of 2.7 Mg C hm–2. Although the carbon sink capacity of the forest ecosystems in Northeast China has been weakened since 2003, the total carbon absorption will still increase. The forest ecosystems in Northeast China are likely to remain a significant carbon sink, and will play a positive role in the mitigation of climate change. Wang, X.-Y., C.-Y. Zhao, and Q.-Y.

The results show that water vapor at low and upper levels of most summer heavy rain (more than 50 mm d−1 and less than 100 mm d−1) in North Xinjiang are mainly transported by westerly circulation from the North Atlantic Ocean and the Eurasian continent. However, rainstorms of more than 100 mm d−1, which are rarely observed, are dominated by vertically integrated moisture from the North Atlantic, Arctic Oceans, and the Eurasian continent, in addition to low-level moisture from the Indian Ocean. Among these sources, the anomalous low-level moisture from the Indian Ocean, which is closely associated with stronger meridional circulation, is considered to be more important with respect to rainstorms. On the days prior to rainstorm days, stronger meridional circulation leads to an anomalous pressure gradient force, which can transport low-level moisture from the Indian Ocean along the eastern periphery of the Tibetan Plateau to North Xinjiang. Furthermore, moisture from the North Atlantic, Arctic Oceans, the Eurasian continent, and the Indian Ocean converge together to influence rainstorm development in this region.",

    "abstract": "Climate change has been linked to well-documented changes in physiology, phenology, species distributions, and in some cases, extinction. Projections of future change point to dramatic shifts in the states of many ecosystems. Accommodating these shifts to effectively conserve biodiversity in the context of uncertain climate regimes represents one of the most difficult challenges faced by conservation planners. A number of adaptation strategies have been proposed for managing species and ecosystems in a changing climate. However, there has been little guidance available on integrating climate change adaptation strategies into contemporary conservation planning frameworks. The paper reviews the different approaches being used to integrate climate change adaptation into conservation planning, broadly categorizing strategies as continuing and extending on \"best practice\" principles and those that integrate species vulnerability assessments into conservation planning. We describe the characteristics of a good adaptation strategy emphasizing the importance of incorporating clear principles of flexibility and efficiency, accounting for uncertainty, integrating human response to climate change and understanding trade-offs.

Biodiversity provides basic needs for livelihoods and development of human beings. China, as one of countries with richest biodiversity in the world, contains 17 globally significant biodiversity hotspots. It was observed that climate change has impacted the biodiversity more or less from physiological, phonological and species level, to ecosystem level, and in some cases extinction of species. With the increasing climate change, the biodiversity subject to be more significantly impacted and human intervention is expected to amplify the impacts. Climate change is believed to be one of key threats of the biodiversity conservation. What kinds of cost-effective strategies and measures may be taken to allow biodiversity to adapt climate change impacts is a great challenge in China. This special issue invited three authors to share actions and experiences on the adaptation of biodiversity to climate change, including a case study, a review of adaptation planning and an introduction of national strategy and research developments. The editors hope these articles can provide useful information for the biodiversity conservation under climate change in China.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the light-absorbing organic carbon, i.e., brown carbon (BrC), has received an increasing attention, because they could significantly absorb the solar radiation in the range of short wavelengths rather than the purely scattering effect. BrC is ubiquitous in the troposphere. It could undergo long range transport within the atmospheric circulation. After the deposition on the surface of snow or ice in the cryospheric region, as the major light absorbing impurities with black carbon and dust, BrC could reduce the snow albedo and accelerate the glacier melting. In this context, this paper summarized the current knowledge of BrC (in aerosols and snow) in the cryospheric regions including the Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpines. Although some works have been conducted in those region, the current dataset on the optical properties of BrC like Absorption Ångström Exponent (AAE) and Mass Absorption Efficiency (MAE) is still limited, which hampers stimulating an accurate evaluation of its climate effects. Especially in the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau, where very limited information concerning BrC is available. Considering biomass burning as a dominant source of BrC, a large amount of emissions from biomass burning in South Asia could reach the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau, where the climate effect of BrC merits more investigation in the future.",

Moreover, this participation reflects China's commitment to including climate change in its ecology improvement program and pursuing a low-carbon society and economy. In order to ensure the success of the Paris Conference, China has contributed significantly. China's constructive participation in global governance shows that China is a responsible power. These principles such as the creation of a future of win–win cooperation with each country contributing to the best of its ability; a future of the rule of law, fairness, and justice; and a future of inclusiveness, mutual learning, and common development will serve as China's guidelines in its efforts to facilitate the implementation of the Paris Agreement and participate in the design of international systems.",

Results show that relative to the pre-industrial era, the mean temperature over Asia increases by 2.3 °C, 3.0 °C, 4.6 °C, and 6.0 °C at warming targets of 1.5 °C, 2 °C, 3 °C, and 4 °C, respectively, with stronger warming in high latitudes than in low latitudes. The corresponding enhancement in mean precipitation over the entire Asian region is 4.4%, 5.8%, 10.2%, and 13.0%, with significant regional differences. In addition, an increase in warm extremes, a decrease in cold extremes, and a strengthening in the variability of amounts of extreme precipitation are projected. Under the 1.5 °C target, compared with the climate under the 2 °C target, the mean temperature will be lower by 0.5–1 °C over Asia; the mean precipitation will be less by 5%–20% over most of Asia, but will be greater by about 10%–15% over West Asia and western South Asia; extreme high temperatures will be uniformly cooler throughout the Asian region, and the warming in extreme low temperatures will decrease significantly in high latitudes of Asia; extreme precipitation will be weaker over most of Asia but will be stronger over West Asia and western South Asia. Under the 1.5 °C and 2 °C warming targets, the probability of very hot weather (anomalies greater than 1σ, σ is standard deviation), extremely hot weather (anomalies greater than 3σ), and extremely heavy precipitation (anomalies greater than 3σ) occurring will increase by at least once, 10%, and 10%, respectively, compared to the reference period (1861–1900).",

Results show there was a significant decrease in the number of extreme cold events (cold nights, cold days, and frost days) but a significant increase in the number of extreme warm events (warm nights, warm days, and summer days) over the entire HKH during 1961–2015. For percentile-based indices, trends of extreme events related to minimum temperature (Tmin) were greater in magnitude than those related to maximum temperature (Tmax). For absolute-value based indices, maximum Tmax, minimum Tmin, and summer days all show increasing trends, while frost days and the diurnal temperature range (DTR) show significant decreasing trends. In addition, there was a decrease in extreme cold events in most parts of east HKH, particularly in Southwest China and the Tibetan Plateau, while there was a general increase in extreme warm events over the entire HKH. Finally, the change in extreme cold events in the HKH appears to be more sensitive to elevation (with cold nights and cold days decreasing with elevation), whereas the change in warm extremes (warm nights, warm days, and maximum Tmax) shows no detectable relationship with elevation. Frost days and minimum Tmin also have a good relationship with elevation, and the trend in frost days decreases with an increase in elevation while the trend in minimum Tmin increases with an increase in elevation.",

In this study, we take the megacity of Beijing as an example and conduct a mixed-methods research using both qualitative and quantitative methods to explore linkage between resilience and development. First, based on expert consultation, we develop an analytical framework and propose reference indicators for measuring urban resilience. Second, we conduct an exploratory factor analysis to justify this analytical framework and rank the urban resilience index for 16 districts in Beijing. Results indicate that urban resilience at the district level is distinguished by the characteristics of the district's functional zones. This implies that the development focus of each district influences the driving factors of urban resilience. This article provides evidence that development and adaptation can be complementary. We showcase in Beijing that urban generic resilience is highly dependent on socio-economic development and urbanization, whereas specific resilience to climatic extremes can be attributed to natural endowment and environmental investment. In conclusion, using this study's findings as a guideline, mega-cities are urged to adopt development-oriented adaptation as a strategy of proactive risk planning in the context of rapid urbanization and global climate change in China.",

The observed results show that an online shopping system using drone delivery is one of the most environmentally friendly transportation options throughout a wide range of scenarios. However, the parts production contributed to significant impacts on environmental issues while the drone operation showed the least impact to all impact categories. The dominant contributors to global warming, abiotic depletion (ADP elements and fossil), acidification air, eutrophication, ozone layer depletion, and photochemical ozone creation impact categories were the coal mining and electricity generating station operation. However, the carbon fibers and the battery, are the main contributors to other impact categories, which include the human toxicity, freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity, marine aquatic ecotoxicity, and terrestric ecotoxicity.",

Utilizing the cryosphere service function (CSF), this study establishes CSF and its value evaluation system. Cryosphere service valuation can benefit the decisionmakers' and public's awareness of environmental protection. Implementing sustainable CSF utilization strategies and macroeconomic policymaking for global environmental protection will have profound and practical significance as well as avoid environmental degradation while pursuing short-term economic profits and achieving rapid economic development.",

    "abstract": "Considering the importance of connecting urbanization phenomena and vulnerability assessments, this paper aims to explore vulnerability assessment in three different city sizes in the northern coast of Central Java province of Indonesia. It compares the vulnerability levels of the three cities based on their sizes (that is, levels of urbanization). It uses the most current secondary data from the lowest administrative levels, called as kelurahan (urban village), for its assessment. There are two indexes used to indicate their vulnerability levels, namely exposure and sensitivity index (ESI) and adaptive capacity index (ACI). By combining the ESI and ACI, the study found that the kelurahans in Tegal (the medium sized city) have similar vulnerability levels. The kelurahans in Semarang (as the big city) have more combination of vulnerability levels—indicating that the city has various sensitivity, exposure, as well as adaptive capacity among its kelurahans. In Lasem (the small sized city), due to limitations imposed by adaptation—mostly because of lack of public services and high dependency on primary economic sectors—all of its kelurahans were found to be vulnerable. The study therefore concluded that the bigger a city is, the more the different areas of that city will have varying levels of vulnerability, leading to a high propensity of vulnerability among its inhabitants. On the other hand, the smaller a city is, the less capacity it will have in reducing its emerging vulnerability challenges.",

Satellite-based land use/land cover (LULC), land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are used to investigate the effects. The study shows that LULC around meteorological stations changed significantly due to urban expansion. Fast urbanization is the main factor that affects the spatial-temporal distribution of thermal environment around meteorological stations. Moreover, the normalized LST and NDVI exhibit strong inverse correlations around meteorological stations, so the variability of LST can be monitored through evaluating the variability of NDVI. In addition, station-relocation plays an important role in improving representativeness of thermal environment. Notably, the environment representativeness was improved, but when using the data from the station to study climate change, the relocation-induced inhomogeneous data should be considered and adjusted. Consequently, controlling the scale and layout of the urban buildings and constructions around meteorological stations is an effective method to ameliorate observational thermal environment and to improve regional representativeness of station observation. The present work provides observational evidences that high resolution Landsat images can be used to evaluate the thermal environment of meteorological stations.",

Two experiments driven by ERA-interim reanalysis were performed, i.e., with and without aerosol–snow/ice feedback. Results indicated that the total deposition BC and organic matter (OM) in snow/ice in the monsoon season (May–September) were much more than non-monsoon season (the remainder of the year). The great BC and OM deposition were simulated along the margin of the TP in the non-monsoon season, and the higher deposition values also occurred in the western TP than the other regions during the monsoon period. BC-in-snow/ice decreased surface albedo and caused positive surface radiative forcing (SRF) (3.0–4.5 W m-2) over the western TP in the monsoon season. The maximum SRF (5–6 W m-2) simulated in the Himalayas and southeastern TP in the non-monsoon season. The surface temperature increased by 0.1–1.5 °C and snow water equivalent decreased by 5–25 mm over the TP, which showed similar spatial distributions with the variations of SRF in each season. This study provided a useful tool to investigate the mechanisms involved in the effect of aerosols on climate change and the water cycle in the cryospheric environment of the TP.",

Economic growth leading to an increase in energy consumption is the main driving factor of CO2 emission growth (an increase of 1.078 Gt CO2) with cumulative contribution rate of 55.92%, while the decline in energy intensity is the main cause of CO2 emission growth inhibition (0.723 Gt CO2 emission reduction) with cumulative contribution rate of 38.27%. Meanwhile, household CO2 emissions are in a weak state of decoupling in general. The change in CO2 emissions caused by population and economic growth shows a weak decoupling and expansive decoupling state, respectively. The CO2 emission change caused by energy intensity is in a state of strong decoupling, and the change caused by energy consumption structure fluctuates between a weak and a strong decoupling state.",

However, regional differences in glacier retreat and its relationship with climatic characteristics have not been conclusively demonstrated. In this study, regional changes in global glaciers based on two primary features, area change and mass balance, were investigated on the basis of data collected from published research on glacier changes. Results show that during the period 1980–2015, the rate of global glacier area shrinkage was 0.18% per year and that of global glacier mass loss was 0.25 m w.e. per year. Retreat of glaciers located at low and middle latitudes was characterized by severe area shrinkage and mass loss. Correspondingly, in the Arctic, deglaciation was characterized by ice thinning due to a low area reduction but relatively high mass loss rate. However, glaciers in high southern latitudes were in a relatively stable status. High Mountain Asia exhibited the lowest rate of area shrinkage and mass loss among glaciers located at low and middle latitudes, and a slower rate of mass loss compared with the global average. Glaciers in the Tropical Andes exhibited the fastest rate of glacier area shrinkage (−1.6% per year), whereas Antarctic and Subantarctic glaciers showed the lowest rate (−0.11% per year). For mass balance, the most negative occurred at Southern Andes (−0.81 m w.e. per year), followed by Alaska (−0.74 m w.e. per year). Only the Antarctic and Subantarctic experienced small mass gain (0.04 m w.e. per year). High levels of correlation are found between the rates of glacier retreat and annual average temperature and annual total precipitation instead of their trends. The variability of the surface climate conditions in the glacier environment plays a key role in driving these regional differences in global glacier retreat.",

The main conclusions are the following: 1) Under the guidance of the regional coordinated development strategy, 13 provinces/municipalities are expected to have a per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of more than US$15,000, and 16 provinces/municipalities will have a per capita GDP of US$10,000–15,000. All provincial economies are expected to achieve steady and rapid development by the end of the 14th FYP. 2) The total energy consumption of the provinces is expected to reach 5.45 Gtce (excluding Tibet) in 2025, and the average annual growth rate is approximately 1.5%. The growth of energy demand will remain in low speed. The key point of energy demand will gradually shift from the eastern to the middle area, while the proportion of energy use in the western provinces will remain stable, which is consistent with the economic development stage and regional coordinated development strategy. 3) The annual average carbon intensity (mainly considering carbon emissions from energy use) of the provinces will approximately with most provinces dropping by over 4.0%. The trend of a considerable decline in carbon intensity, as observed in recent years, is expected to continue.",

    "abstract": "Tibetan Plateau (TP, with the height > 3000 m) is a region with complex topographical features and a large diversity of climate both in space and time. The use of higher resolution regional climate models (RCMs) to downscale global climate model simulations is of high importance. In the present study, future climate change over TP and the surrounding areas is investigated based on the ensemble of a set of the 21st century climate change projections using the RCM RegCM4. The model is driven by five different GCMs at a grid spacing of 25 km under RCP4.5. The focus is on the December‒January‒February (DJF), June‒July‒August (JJA), and annual mean temperature and precipitation, with comparisons against the driving GCMs also provided. Overall, the RegCM4 greatly improves the simulation by providing finer scale spatial details of both temperature and precipitation distributions over the region. The topographic effects are well reproduced by RegCM4 but not the GCMs. For the projected future changes, general warming and increase in precipitation are found in both GCM and RegCM4 simulations. However, substantial differences exist in both the spatial distribution and magnitude of the changes. The added value of RegCM4 for temperature, in addition to the finer spatial details, is characterized by a more pronounced warming in DJF over TP compared to its surrounding areas. The projected changes of precipitation show also differences between RegCM4 and the driving GCMs. The increase of precipitation is more pronounced and over the basins in DJF for RegCM4, and in general with a better agreement across the simulations compared to the driving GCMs.",

Based on the biological characteristics of Aedes albopictus and the dengue epidemic process, dengue transmission biological model was developed to project the risk epidemic areas. Observational temperature data in 1981–2016 at 740 stations and grid data of 0.5° × 0.5° (15°−55.5°N, 70°−140.5°E) under selected RCPs in 2020s, 2030s, 2050s and 2100s were used. Relative to 142 counties and 168 million people living in the projected high risk area of dengue in the climate condition of 1981–2016, dengue high risk areas in China would expand under same RCP scenarios in the 21st century with time past except RCP2.6 with a turning down point in 2050s. Especially under RCP8.5 which global mean temperature would increase by 4.9 °C till 2100s, the high risk area and population for dengue transmission would expand additional 34 counties (20 million) in 2020s, 114 counties (60 million) in 2030s, 208 counties (160 million) in 2050 and 456 counties (490 million) in 2100s respectively than those of 1981–2016. For RCP8.5 in 2100s, the population and expanded high risk areas would increase 4.2-fold and 2.9-fold than the 1981–2016 mean.

Consequently, drought conditions have generally relieved except in the south and northeast where precipitation has decreased. Combining analyses of gridded-dataset-derived drought indices with vegetation indices during 1982–2015, vegetation improvement in most regions of the Plateau is mainly due to lessened drought conditions. Noticeably, vegetation degradation is also found in part of southern Tibetan Plateau mainly resulting from drought enhancement. This study is expected to provide scientific basis for understanding of change in drought condition and its impacts on vegetation over different regions of TP under global warming background.",

    "abstract": "A clear understanding of the changes of water resources under the background of environmental changes is of great significance for scientific management and utilization of water resources in China. This study systematically analyzed the spatial–temporal variations of surface water resources in China since 2000. Water vulnerability in current (2010s) and its trends from 2000 to late-2010s in different regions of China were also summarized. In addition, the correspondingly adaptive measures to counter regional risks to water resources were proposed. We concluded that the runoff of major rivers had been decreasing in eastern China and increasing in western China during 2000–2018. In the arid area of Northwest China, the alpine runoff has shown an overall upward trend since the late-1990s/early-2000s, with a 10%–25% increase caused by the increase of glacial meltwater and precipitation. While the runoff of each hydrological station in the 2000s–2010s was 34.7% lower than that in the 1950s–2010s on average. The increases in precipitation and glacial meltwater with global warming caused a rapid expansion of lakes in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and Xinjiang, thus leading to an increase in total area and water quantity of lakes in China from 1995 to 2015. The mean contribution rates of climate change and human activity to runoff change in river basins of China were 53.5% and 46.5%, respectively, during the period of 2000–2010s. The driving factor of runoff change in many river basins has gradually changed from climate change (1950s‒2000) to human activity (2000–2018). During 2000–2018, the contributions of human activities to runoff change were 50%–80% in major rivers of eastern China. The vulnerability in most areas of Northwest China and North China is generally high, with the vulnerability index greater than 0.6. Comparatively, in Northeast, East, South, and Central China, it is lower or not vulnerable. In Southwest China, the vulnerability varies greatly with Yunnan and Sichuan relatively low while Chongqing and Guizhou relatively high. The precipitation increase, the application of water-saving technology, the establishment of flood control and drought relief engineering facilities, and the introduction of relevant policies and measures have helped to gradually reduce the vulnerability of water resources in most areas of North and Northwest China (except Xinjiang) from 2000 to 2010s. Water vulnerability has been increasing in southern China, caused by climate change and the development of industry and agriculture, which increases water resource exposure since 2000. Based on the typical risk factors and vulnerability characteristics of water resources in different regions, this study proposed some targeted adaptive measures correspondingly so as to scientifically deal with the problems of surface water resources in China.",

The response of permafrost to climate change remains unclear due to limited field investigations. Thus, longer-term responses of the ground thermal state to climate change since 2011 have been monitored at four sites with varied surface characteristics: Carex tato wetland (P1) and shrub-C. tato wetland (P2) with a multi-year average temperatures at the depth of zero annual amplitude (TZAA) of −0.52 and −1.19 °C, respectively; Betula platyphylla-Larix gmelinii (Rupr.) Kuzen mixed forest (P3) with TZAA of 0.17 °C, and; the forest of L. gmelinii (Rupr.) Kuzen (P4) with TZAA of 1.65 °C. Continuous observations demonstrate that the ecosystem-protected Xing'an permafrost experienced a cooling under a warming climate. The temperature at the top of permafrost (TTOP) rose (1.8 °C per decade) but the TZAA declined (−0.14 °C per decade), while the active layer thickness (ALT) thinned from 0.9 m in 2012 to 0.8 m in 2014 at P1. Both the TTOP and TZAA increased (0.89 and 0.06 °C per decade, respectively), but the ALT thinned from 1.4 m in 2012 to 0.7 m in 2016 at P2. Vertically detached permafrost at P3 disappeared in summer 2012, with warming rates of +0.42 and + 0.17 °C per decade for TTOP and TZAA, respectively. However, up to date, the ground thermal state has remained stable at P4. We conclude that the thermal offset is crucial for the preservation and persistence of the Xing'an permafrost at the southern fringe.",

    "abstract": "Many glaciers and ice caps on the Tibetan Plateau have retreated and lost mass in recent years in response to temperature increases, providing clear evidence of the impact of climate change on the region. There is increasing evidence that many of the glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau have also shown periodically dynamic behaviour in the form of glacier surging and some even catastrophic collapse events. In this study, we examine the prevalence of glacier surging at the Geladandong ice caps, North East Tibetan Plateau, to better understand the role of surge events in the evolution of glacier mass loss budgets. Using glacier surface elevation change data over the period 1969–2018 and glacier surface velocity data from the ITS_LIVE dataset, we find that 19 outlet glaciers of the ice caps are of surge-type. Our multi-temporal measurements of glacier mass balance show that surge-type glacier mass budgets vary depending on the portion of the surge-cycle captured by geodetic data. At the regional level, pre- and post-surge glacier mass loss variability does not bias regional mass budget estimates, but enhanced, or suppressed, mass loss estimates are likely when small groups of glaciers are examined. Our results emphasise the importance of accurate surge-type glacier inventories and the need to maximise geodetic data coverage over glacierised regions known to contain surge-type glaciers.",

    "abstract": "Glasgow Climate Conference concluded the negotiation on implementing rules for Paris Agreement and adopted the Glasgow Climate Pact. Based on practices under the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol, Paris Agreement enhanced global climate change governance. Paris Agreement established a system centered around 'nationally determined contributions' (NDCs) of Parties, with a transparency framework to ensure information flow running the system, meanwhile facilitating implementation by Parties through the mechanism on facilitation and compliance, as well as urging Parties to enhance ambition both at individual level and aggregate level through the mechanism on Global Stocktake. By doing so, it is logical that the system would lead to the achievement of the goal set by Paris Agreement. However, the system still faces significant deficiency, such as lack of information timeliness, intransparency of some necessary information, hypothesis-based but not solution-based decision-making, and lack of effective assurance for developing countries to get finance and technology support. It is concluded that this system is beneficial to long-term climate change policy decision and tracking progress of actions, while for short-term decision-making, more comprehensive consideration is needed than only based on the mechanisms of and outcomes from the system. International society should pay more attention to the progress of implementation, as well as ambition of various support provided to developing countries, than only the ambition of mitigation target numbers.",

    "abstract": "Due to their huge socio-economic impacts and complex formation causes, extreme and continuous drought events have become the focus and nodus of research in recent years. In the midsummer (July–August) of 2022, a severe drought event occurred in the whole Yangtze River Basin (YRB), China. During that period, the precipitation in the upper, middle and lower reaches of the YRB dropped over 40% less than the 1961–2021 climatic mean, which had never happened previously. Furthermore, the temperature was the highest during 1961–2022. The record-breaking magnitude of less rainfall and high temperature directly led to the continuous development of this extreme drought event. An atmospheric moisture budget analysis revealed that the YRB midsummer rainfall anomaly was dominated by the anomalous powerful vertical moisture advection, which was derived from the strongest descending motion over the whole YRB in the 2022 midsummer during 1981–2022. The western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) during the midsummer remained stronger, more westward and lasted longer than the climatic mean. As a result, the whole YRB was controlled by a positive geopotential height centre. Further evidence revealed that the anomalous subtropical zonal flow played a crucial role in inducing the extreme descent over the YRB. Moreover, the anomalous upper-tropospheric easterly flow over the YRB in 2022 is the strongest during 1981–2022, modulating the generation of the unprecedented descent anomaly over the YRB. The likelihood that an integrated connection of the severe drought in East Asia and flood in West Asia and northwestern South Asia would occur increased when the extremely strong easterly anomalies in the upper troposphere emerged and induced descending adiabatic flow on the eastern sides of the Tibetan Plateau. The results of this study can provide scientific insights into the predictability of extreme drought events and provide ways to improve predictions.",

Nevertheless, the underlying physical process, including local drivers and remote associations, remains poorly understood, thereby hindering accurate predictability. In this study, we reported an extreme MHW event in the East China Seas (ECSs, including the Bohai, Yellow, and East China Sea), lasting for 75 d with a maximum intensity of 1.96 °C relative to 1982–2011 during the summer 2022. This ECSs MHW event was triggered by a combination of anomalous atmospheric and oceanic conditions, including enhanced insolation, weakened surface wind speed, suppressed latent heat loss from ocean, a shallower mixed layer, and upper ocean current anomaly. Mixed-layer temperature budget diagnosis suggested that changes in the ECSs temperature were dominated by the surface net heat flux, largely due to strong shortwave radiation flux, during the development and decay of the MHW event. Oceanic advection also created favorable conditions for the maintenance of the MHW. These physical drivers were further regulated by the westward expanded and intensified western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH), potentially linked to the negative phase of Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Despite the three years (2020‒2022) consecutive La Niña events, the ECSs summer MHWs appeared to be more closely linked to negative IOD events, with a lagging period of 1–3 mon. The seasonal precursor signals of the negative IOD have the potential to affect local physical drivers of ECSs MHWs through regulating the strength and position of WPSH, thus serving as a promising predictor for the ECSs MHWs. The future likelihood and intensity of the ECSs MHWs are projected to increase substantially in the coming decades, largely due to broad-scale warming attributed to anthropogenic climate change. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop MHW forecasting and early warning systems, and robust approaches to address climate change.",

This study provides a comprehensive review of international carbon accounting standards and guidelines while assessing the potential impact of upcoming carbon tax policies, such as the EU CBAM and the U.S. CCA. On this basis, the current situation and challenges of China's carbon emission accounting system are systematically analysed, and suggestions for improvement are proposed. The results show that carbon tax policies will increase the requirements for emission inventories and will strengthen the correlation between different levels. The improvement of China's carbon accounting system should be accelerated. Although the regional carbon accounting guidelines are already in line with international guidelines, further improvements are needed at the enterprise and product levels. New boundaries need to be set in China's corporate carbon accounting guidelines, and the speed of developing product carbon accounting guidelines should be increased. The quality of emissions inventories should be comprehensively improved by implementing a combination of policies, including corporate carbon information disclosure, green supply chain construction, activity data statistics and verification, and a dynamic emission factor database.",

    "abstract": "Mountainous areas are of special hydrological concern because topography and atmospheric conditions can result in large and sudden floods, posing serious risks to water-related safety in neighbouring countries. The Yarlung Zangbo (YZ) River basin is the largest river basin on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), but how floods will discharge in this basin and how the role of glacier melt in floods will change throughout the 21st-century under shared socioeconomic pathways scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) remain unclear. Here, we comprehensively address this scientific question based on a well-validated large-scale glacier-hydrology model. The results indicate that extreme floods was projected to increase in the YZ basin, and was mainly reflected in increased duration (4–10 d per decade) and intensity (153–985 m3 s−1 per decade). Glacier runoff was projected to increase (2–30 mm per decade) throughout the 21st-century, but there was also a noticeable decrease or deceleration in glacier runoff growth in the late first half of the century under the SSP2-4.5, and in the latter half of the century under the SSP5-8.5. Glacier melt was projected to enhance the duration (12%–23%) and intensity (15%–21%) of extreme floods under both SSPs, which would aggravate the impact of future floods on the socioeconomics of the YZ basin. This effect was gradually overwhelmed by precipitation-induced floods from glacier areas to YZ outlet. This study takes the YZ basin as a projection framework example to help enrich the understanding of future flood hazards in basins affected by rainfall- or meltwater across the TP, and to help policy-makers and water managers develop future plans.",

    "abstract": "Reliable monitoring and thorough spatiotemporal prediction of meteorological drought are crucial for early warning and decision-making regarding drought-related disasters. The utilisation of multiscale methods is effective for a comprehensive evaluation of drought occurrence and progression, given the complex nature of meteorological drought. Nevertheless, the nonlinear spatiotemporal features of meteorological droughts, influenced by various climatological, physical and environmental factors, pose significant challenges to integrated prediction that considers multiple indicators and time scales. To address these constraints, we introduce an innovative deep learning framework based on the shifted window transformer, designed for executing spatiotemporal prediction of meteorological drought across multiple scales. We formulate four prediction indicators using the standardized precipitation index and the standard precipitation evaporation index as core methods for drought definition using the ERA5 reanalysis dataset. These indicators span time scales of approximately 30 d and one season. Short-term indicators capture more anomalous variations, whereas long-term indicators attain comparatively higher accuracy in predicting future trends. We focus on the East Asian region, notable for its diverse climate conditions and intricate terrains, to validate the model's efficacy in addressing the complexities of nonlinear spatiotemporal prediction. The model's performance is evaluated from diverse spatiotemporal viewpoints, and practical application values are analysed by representative drought events. Experimental results substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed model in providing accurate multiscale predictions and capturing the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of drought. Each of the four drought indicators accurately delineates specific facets of the meteorological drought trend. Moreover, three representative drought events, namely flash drought, sustained drought and severe drought, underscore the significance of selecting appropriate prediction indicators to effectively denote different types of drought events. This study provides methodological and technological support for using a deep learning approach in meteorological drought prediction. Such findings also demonstrate prediction issues related to natural hazards in regions with scarce observational data, complex topography and diverse microclimate systems.",

From the perspective of the combination effect of the global warming and La Niña condition, potential mechanisms of the hot extreme were investigated. Such a record-breaking hot extreme was caused by an extremely strong and westward-shifted western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH). The global warming effect contributed primarily to the abnormal hot days in the Yangtze River basin, coupled with the modulation of the La Niña condition. The sea surface temperature anomaly pattern under La Niña condition favored more convection activities over the western Pacific, encouraging an enhanced and westward-extended WPSH.

    "abstract": "A warming–wetting climate trend has led to increased runoff in most watersheds in the Tian Shan Mountains over the past few decades. However, it remains unclear how runoff components, that is, rainfall runoff (Rrain), snowmelt runoff (Rsnow), and glacier meltwater (Rglacier), responded to historical climate change and how they will evolve under future climate change scenarios. Here, we used a modified Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) model and a detrending method to quantify the impact of precipitation and temperature changes on runoff components in the largest river (Manas River) on the northern slope of the Tian Shan Mountains from 1982 to 2015. A multivariate calibration strategy, including snow cover, glacier area, and runoff was implemented to constrain model parameters associated with runoff components. The downscaled outputs of 12 general circulation models (GCMs) from the Sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) were also used to force the modified HBV model to project the response of runoff and its components to future (2016–2100) climate change under three common socio-economic pathways (SSP126, SSP245, and SSP585). The results indicate that Rrain dominates mean annual runoff with a proportion of 42%, followed by Rsnow (37%) and Rglacier (21%). In terms of inter-annual variation, Rrain and Rsnow show increasing trends (0.93 (p < 0.05) and 0.31 (p > 0.05) mm per year), while Rglacier exhibits an insignificant (p > 0.05) decreasing trend (−0.12 mm per year), leading to an increasing trend in total runoff (1.12 mm per year, p > 0.05). The attribution analysis indicates that changes in precipitation and temperature contribute 8.16 and 10.37 mm, respectively, to the increase in runoff at the mean annual scale. Climate wetting (increased precipitation) increases Rrain (5.03 mm) and Rsnow (3.19 mm) but has a limited effect on Rglacier (−0.06 mm), while warming increases Rrain (10.69 mm) and Rglacier (5.79 mm) but decreases Rsnow (−6.12 mm). The negative effect of glacier shrinkage on Rglacier has outweighed the positive effect of warming on Rglacier, resulting in the tipping point (peak water) for Rglacier having passed. Runoff projections indicate that future decreases in Rglacier and Rsnow could be offset by increases in Rrain due to increased precipitation projections, reducing the risk of shortages of available water resources. However, management authorities still need to develop adequate adaptation strategies to cope with the continuing decline in Rglacier in the future, considering the large inter-annual fluctuations and high uncertainty in precipitation projection.",

Using machine learning methodologies, we mapped the current and future RTSs susceptibility distributions by incorporating a range of environmental factors and RTSs inventories. We identified thawing-degree days and maximum summer rainfall as the primary environmental factors affecting RTSs susceptibility. The final ensemble susceptibility map suggests that regions with high to very high susceptibility could constitute (11.6 ± 0.78)% of the Northern Hemisphere's permafrost region. When juxtaposed with the current (2000-2020) RTSs susceptibility map, the total area with high to very high susceptibility could witness an increase ranging from (31.7 ± 0.65)% (SSP585) to (51.9± 0.73)% (SSP126) by the 2041-2060.

    "abstract": "The coastal wetlands of the Yellow River Delta (YRD) in China are crucial for their valuable resources, environmental significance, and economic contributions. However, these wetlands are also vulnerable to the dual threats of climate change and human disturbances. Despite substantial attention to the historical shifts in YRD's coastal wetlands, uncertainties remain regarding their future trajectory in the face of compounded risks from climate change and anthropogenic activities. Based on a range of remote sensing data sources, this study undertakes a comprehensive investigation into the evolution of YRD's coastal wetlands between 2000 and 2020. Subsequently, the potential fate of coastal wetlands is thoroughly analyzed through the Land Use/Cover Change (LUCC) simulation using System Dynamic-Future Land Use Simulation (SD-FLUS) model and the extreme water levels projection integrated future sea-level rise, storm surge, and astronomical high tide in 2030, 2050, and 2100 under scenarios of SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5. Results reveal that YRD's coastal wetlands underwent a marked reduction, shrinking by 1688.72 km2 from 2000 to 2020. This decline was mostly attributed to the substantial expansion in the areas of artificial wetlands (increasing by 823.78 km2), construction land (increasing by 767.71 km2), and shallow water (increasing by 274.58 km2). Looking ahead to 2030–2100, the fate of coastal wetlands appears to diverge based on different scenarios. Under the SSP1-2.6 scenario, the area of coastal wetland is projected to experience considerable growth. In contrast, the SSP5-8.5 scenario anticipates a notable decrease in coastal wetlands. Relative to the inundated area suffered from the current extreme water levels, the study projects a decrease of 6.8%–10.6% in submerged coastal wetlands by 2030 and 9.4%–18.2% by 2050 across all scenarios. In 2100, these percentages are projected to decrease by 0.4% (SSP2-4.5) and 27.1% (SSP5-8.5), but increase by 35.7% (SSP1-2.6). Results suggest that coastal wetlands in the YRD will face a serious compound risk from climate change and intensified human activities in the future, with climate change being the more important factor. More efficient and forward-looking measures must be implemented to prioritize the conservation and management of coastal wetland ecosystems to address the challenges, especially those posed by climate change.",

The results showed that the degradation of the warm permafrost layer with a geothermal gradient of zero occurred simultaneously in the top and bottom directions. The rate of permafrost degradation from the top down and bottom up increase during the degradation process, but the increase of the former is more drastic after the formation of thawed interlayer. Additionally, the construction of the Qinghai‒Tibet Railway changed the degradation modes of the permafrost in adjacent natural sites through horizontal heat transfer, particularly after through talik formation under the embankment. The findings suggest that taking countermeasures before or immediately after forming thawed interlayer is more effective. When evaluating the thermal impact of projects in warm permafrost regions, special attention should be given to the horizontal heat transfer process that may result from the formation of a through talik.",

Geo-LightGBM demonstrated excellent LST estimation accuracy, with an R2 (coefficient of determination) of 0.971, RMSE (root-mean-square error) of 2.479 °C, and MAE (mean absolute error) of 1.510 °C. The estimated LST values for the year 2020 agreed well with observed values, with remarkable differences in hourly LST variations. Meanwhile, the estimated LST was more accurate than that from FY-4A. Spatially, there were two high LST centers, located in the Yarlung Zangbo River Basin and the Qaidam Basin, and a low LST center located in the central TP. The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and correlation analyses revealed DSCS (the mean ground downward shortwave radiation under clear-sky conditions) to be the most importantly input variable for estimating LST. Spatiotemporal dummy variables (e.g., longitude, latitude, DEM) were also found to be crucial for model accuracy improvement. Our findings indicate the potential for constructing a high-precision and seamless 24-h LST real-time retrieval and monitoring platform for the TP by combining satellite and China's independently developed CLDAS (China Land Data Assimilation System) data in future.",

    "abstract": "Near-surface wind speed exerts profound impacts on many environmental issues, while the long-term (≥60 years) trend and multidecadal variability in the wind speed and its underlying causes in global high-elevation and mountainous areas (e.g., Tibetan Plateau) remain largely unknown. Here, by examining homogenized wind speed data from 104 meteorological stations over the Tibetan Plateau for 1961‒2020 and ERA5 reanalysis datasets, we investigated the variability and long-term trend in the near-surface wind speed and revealed the role played by the westerly and Asian monsoon. The results show that the homogenized annual wind speed displays a decreasing trend (−0.091 m s−1 per decade, p < 0.05), with the strongest in spring (−0.131 m s−1 per decade, p < 0.05), and the weakest in autumn (−0.071 m s−1 per decade, p < 0.05). There is a distinct multidecadal variability of wind speed, which manifested in an prominent increase in 1961‒1970, a sustained decrease in 1970‒2002, and a consistent increase in 2002‒2020. The observed decadal variations are likely linked to large-scale atmospheric circulation, and the correlation analysis unveiled a more important role of westerly and East Asian winter monsoon in modulating near-surface wind changes over the Tibetan Plateau. The potential physical processes associated with westerly and Asian monsoon changes are in concordance with wind speed change, in terms of overall weakened horizontal air flow (i.e., geostrophic wind speed), declined vertical thermal and dynamic momentum transfer (i.e., atmospheric stratification thermal instability and vertical wind shear), and varied Tibetan Plateau vortices. This indicates that to varying degrees these processes may have contributed to the changes in near-surface wind speed over the Tibetan Plateau. This study has implications for wind power production and soil wind erosion prevention in the Tibetan Plateau.",

Afternoon precipitation is much more pronounced over the PRD urban areas than the surrounding rural areas, which is probably because of the increase in short-duration heavy rain over urban areas.",

The location, capacity and age of landfills constitute the three dimensions of the emission factors matrix, which were obtained by laboratory analysis and in situ investigation. Key parameters such as waste composition, degradable organic carbon ratio, CH4 correction factor, oxidation factor and recovery rate, were carefully analyzed in terms of these three dimensions. The point sources database consists of 2,107 MSW landfills in cities and towns of China in 2007. The results show that the CH4 emissions from MSW landfills were 1.186 Mt in 2007. Compared with the CH4 emissions of 2.20 Mt in 2005, the significant discrepancy mainly comes from statistical data of landfills, e.g., number of landfills and amount of waste disposed in landfills. CH4 emissions were lower than 700 t for most of the landfills, whereas there were 279 landfills with emissions larger than 1,000 t, and only 10 landfills with emissions larger than 10,000 t. Jiangsu province ranks the largest emitter with 98,700 t while Tibet is the smallest emitter with 2,100 t. In general, the emissions from eastern provinces, such as Jiangsu, Guangdong and Zhejiang, were larger than those from western provinces, such as Ningxia, Tibet and Qinghai.

The results indicate that winter and summer are the two peak seasons of energy consumption due to the urban residential heating and cooling demand. The base temperature of electricity and daily temperature is 10°C in winter and 22°C in summer respectively. When the outdoor temperature is below 10°C, the heating demand becomes obvious, and with over 22°C the cooling demand. The spatial distribution of cooling degree-days (CDD) and heating degree-days (HDD) clearly shows urbanization effects. By the influence of urbanization the central city experiences greater CDD in summer and lower HDD in winter.

It also represents a summary of the achievements made by the National Key Basic Research and Development Program (2010CB428400), where the major research focuses are detection and attribution, extreme floods and droughts, and adaptation of water resources management. Preliminary conclusions can be summarized into four points: 1) Water cycling and water resource changes in the EMRC are rather complicated as the region is impacted by natural changes relating to the strong monsoon influence and also by climate change impacts caused by CO2 emissions due to anthropogenic forcing; 2) the rate of natural variability contributing to the influence on precipitation accounts for about 70%, and the rate from anthropogenic forcing accounts for 30% on average in the EMRC. However, with future scenarios of increasing CO2 emissions, the contribution rate from anthropogenic forcing will increase and water resources management will experience greater issues related to the climate change impact; 3) Extreme floods and droughts in the EMRC will be an increasing trend, based on IPCC-AR5 scenarios; 4) Along with rising temperatures of 1 °C in North China, the agricultural water consumption will increase to about 4% of total water consumption. Therefore, climate change is making a significant impact and will be a risk to the EMRC, which covers almost all of the eight major river basins, such as the Yangtze River, Yellow River, Huaihe River, Haihe River, and Pearl River, and to the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (middle line). To ensure water security, it is urgently necessary to take adaptive countermeasures and reduce the vulnerability of water resources and associated risks.",

    "abstract": "Global climate change promotes the energy system reform. Achieving a high proportion of renewable energy becomes the major countries' energy strategy. As proposed in its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC), China intends to raise the proportion of non-fossil energy in primary energy consumption to about 20% by 2030. That ambitious goal means the non-fossil energy supplies by 2030 will be 7–8 times that of 2005, and the annual increase rate is more than 8% within the 25 years. Besides, the capacity of wind power, solar power, hydropower and nuclear power reaches 400 GW, 350 GW, 450 GW, and 150 GW respectively, and China's non-fossil power capacity is even greater than the U.S.'s total power capacity. In addition, the scale of natural gas increases. Consequently, by 2030, the proportion of coal falls from the current 70% to below 50%, and the CO2 intensity of energy consumption decreases by 20% compared with the level of 2005, which play important roles in significantly reducing the CO2 intensity of GDP. Since China has confirmed to achieve the CO2 emissions peak around 2030, at that time, the newly added energy demand will be satisfied by non-fossil energy, and the consumption of fossil fuel will stop growing. By 2030, non-fossil energy accounts for 20%, and the large scale and sound momentum of new and renewable energy industry will support the growth of total energy demand, which plays a key role in CO2 emissions peaking and beginning to decline, and lays the foundation for establishing a new energy system dominated by new and renewable energy in the second half of the 21st century as well as finally achieving the CO2 zero-emission.",

In North and Southwest China, both persistent and non-persistent extreme precipitation decreased; the decreasing trend of persistent extreme precipitation was more prominent; thus, extreme precipitation event occurred more as non-persistent event.

The purposes of this study were to assess the vulnerability of households and agro-ecosystems to climate change and environmental degradation and the factors determining vulnerabilities in the central rift valley, Ethiopia. Data were collected between November 2014 and May 2015 by interviewing 355 respondents. This has been supplemented with focus group discussions and key informant interviews. The indicator and matrix methods were used to describe socio-ecological vulnerabilities. The results showed that about 9% of the respondents were highly vulnerable to climate change/variability, and environmental degradation. Households in the lowland have the largest proportion of high vulnerable households (60%), while households in highland have the largest proportion of low vulnerable households (30%). In the lowland agro-ecology, the adaptive capacity component has contributed the largest share to household's vulnerability index to the impacts of climate change/variability and environmental degradation. The sensitivity component has higer contribution in highland agro-ecology and the exposure component in the midland agro-ecology. There were variations of income deviation between agro-ecologies that lead to variation in vulnerability of households. Household vulnerability index has shown a very light negative correlation with livelihood diversification index. The poorest households with little share of the total income distribution and with low livelihood diversity index, were the most vulnerable. The results showed that the highest exposure index on ecosystem functions and agricultural performance were in the lowland agro-ecology. This study highlighted the need to assess the social and ecological vulnerabilities in integrated approach as singling out one from the other is difficult. That is, social vulnerability impacts ecological vulnerability and vice versa.",

    "abstract": "China has achieved a political consensus around the need to transform the path of economic growth toward one that lowers carbon intensity and ultimately leads to reductions in carbon emissions, but there remain different views on pathways that could achieve such a transformation. The essential question is whether radical or incremental reforms are required in the coming decades. This study explores relevant pathways in China beyond 2020, particularly modeling the major target choices of carbon emission peaking in China around 2030 as China-US Joint Announcement by an integrated assessment model for climate change IAMC based on carbon factor theory. Here scenarios DGS-2020, LGS2025, LBS-2030 and DBS-2040 derived from the historical pathways of developed countries are developed to access the comprehensive impacts on the economy, energy and climate security for the greener development in China. The findings suggest that the period of 2025–2030 is the window of opportunity to achieve a peak in carbon emissions at a level below 12 Gt CO2 and 8.5 t per capita by reasonable trade-offs from economy growth, annually −0.2% in average and cumulatively −3% deviation to BAU in 2030. The oil and natural gas import dependence will exceed 70% and 45% respectively while the non-fossil energy and electricity share will rise to above 20% and 45%. Meantime, the electrification level in end use sectors will increase substantially and the electricity energy ratio approaching 50%, the labor and capital productivity should be double in improvements and the carbon intensity drop by 65% by 2030 compared to the 2005 level, and the cumulative emission reductions are estimated to be more than 20 Gt CO2 in 2015–2030.",

    "abstract": "This paper gives an overview of the current understanding of the observations of black carbon (BC) in snow and ice, and the estimates of BC deposition and its radiative forcing over the Arctic. Both of the observations and model results show that, in spring, the average BC concentration and the resulting radiative forcing in Russian Arctic > Canadian and Alaskan Arctic > Arctic Ocean and Greenland. The observed BC concentration presented a significant decrease trend from the Arctic coastal regions to the center of Arctic Ocean. In summer, due to the combined effects of BC accumulation and enlarged snow grain size, the averaged radiative forcing per unit area over the Arctic Ocean is larger than that over each sector of the Arctic in spring. However, because summer sea ice is always covered by a large fraction of melt ponds, the role of BC in sea ice albedo evolution during this period is secondary. Multi-model mean results indicate that the annual mean radiative forcing from all sources of BC in snow and ice over the Arctic was ∼0.17 W m−2. Wet deposition is the dominant removal mechanism in the Arctic, which accounts for more than 90% of the total deposition. In the last part, we discuss the uncertainties in present modeling studies, and suggest potential approaches to reduce the uncertainties.",

    "abstract": "The 21st Conference of Party (COP21) held in Paris at the end of 2015 has opened a new era for the joint response dealing with climate change globally, and built up a new mode of global climate governance, that is, \"all Parties submit INDC – global stocktake – enhance effort of actions – all Parties resubmit INDC – finally achieve the ultimate objective of the Convention.\" With 160 INDC reports (covering 188 Parties) that the UNFCCC Secretariat has currently received as research objects, this study classifies the mitigation targets of all Parties, and focuses on the systematic analysis of the financial demand, mitigation cost and priority investment areas for developing countries. The results are as follows: among 160 INDC reports, 122 reports clearly include the finance content; 64 reports propose specific amount of financial demand for the implementation of INDC; 31 reports pre-estimate domestic amount and financial demand for greenhouse gas mitigation in 2030, based on which they have calculated that the average mitigation cost for developing countries in 2030 would have reached up to US$22.3 per ton CO2; 28 Parties reclassify the financial demand for mitigation and adaptation areas, and reach the conclusion that the overall financial demand ratio for mitigation and adaptation is 1.4. Should the current mitigation commitments of the Parties from developed countries be used as benchmark, then in 2030 the total amount of financial demand for developing countries in response to climate change would have reached up to US$474 billion.",

Compared with the current summer climate (1975–2005), both surface air temperature and precipitation increase significantly over the East Asian continent during the 1.5 GW period (average period 2021–2051). In northeastern China this is particularly pronounced with regional averaged precipitation increases of more than 7.2%, which is greater than that for the whole East Asian continent (approximately 4.2%). Due to stronger enhancement of precipitation north of 40°N, the leading empirical orthogonal function (EOF) mode of summer precipitation over the East Asian continent changes from tripolar-like mode to dipole mode. As there is stronger surface warming over the East Asian continent than that over surrounding ocean, the land–sea thermal contrast is enhanced during the 1.5 GW period. As a result, the monsoon circulation in the lower troposphere is significantly strengthened, which causes the increased summer precipitation over the East Asian continent. In addition, larger interannual variabilities of East Asian summer monsoon circulation and associated precipitation are also suggested for the 1.5 GW period.",

Based on the operating situations of international carbon emission trading markets and that in China, this study compares and analyzes the potential risks in the European Union Emission Trading Scheme, California's cap-and-trade system, and the seven regional carbon trading pilots in China. It mainly recognizes market operation risks, risks of uncertain policy expectation, and risks of uncertain mechanism designs existing in China's carbon trading pilots. The carbon market risks are not good for the formation of rational price signals, making it difficult to guide enterprises on how to make low-carbon technology investments. Such risks also affect the effectiveness and functions of carbon markets, which can lead to the non-achievement of national emission reduction goals. China has launched the national carbon emission trading scheme on December 19, 2017. While building the national carbon trading scheme, it is important to fully refer to the experiences of international carbon markets and China's carbon trading pilots apart from strengthening the recognition, control, and supervision of carbon market risks. Doing so can promote the healthy development of China's national carbon trading scheme.",

Under global warming of 1.5 °C, 2 °C, 3 °C, and 4 °C, significant decrease of HDD can be found over China without considering population factor, with greater decrease over high elevation and high latitude regions, including the Tibetan Plateau, the northern part of Northeast China, and Northwest China; while population-weighted HDD increased in areas where population will increase in the future, such as Beijing, Tianjin, parts of southern Hebei, northern Shandong and Henan provinces. Similarly, the CDD projections with and without considering population factor are largely different. Specifically, without considering population, increase of CDD were observed over most parts of China except the Tibetan Plateau where the CDD remained zero because of the cold climate even under global warming; while considering population factor, the future CDD decreases in South China and increases in North China, the Sichuan Basin, and the southeastern coastal areas, which is directly related to the population changes. The different future changes of HDD and CDD when considering and disregarding the effects of population show that population distribution plays an important role in energy consumption, which should be considered in future research.",

    "abstract": "China must urgently accelerate its decrease of energy use, optimize its energy structure, reduce CO2 emissions, and promote the early realization of an ecological civilization. Simultaneously, meeting the growing consumer demand is one of the reasons for the increase in energy use. This study investigates the impacts of household consumption on energy use and CO2 emissions from the perspective of the lifestyle of Chinese residents. On the basis of the input–output model of 30 provinces, we analyze the current situation of energy use and CO2 emissions in different regions (spatial scale) with economic development and income improvement (time scale), investigate the pulling effect of household consumption in different provinces on industrial sectors, examine the influencing factors of indirect CO2 emissions from food, clothing, housing, and transportation in key regions, and explore the policy implications of the transition to a low-carbon lifestyle in different provinces. Results show that the fuel structure of Chinese residents should be optimized further. Total household energy consumption and total CO2 emissions considerably increased. In 2012, total household energy consumption accounted for nearly 30% of total energy consumption, while indirect CO2 emissions accounted for 66.3% of total household emissions. With regard to the structures of indirect household energy consumption, the housing sector accounted for the largest proportion, reaching 23.4% in indirect energy consumption in 2012. The pulling effect of the housing sector on industrial sectors was also evident. The decomposition analysis showed that the rapid increase in indirect household CO2 emissions was primarily due to the increase in per capita living expenditure. The consumption structures in different provinces produced various impacts, and the energy intensity effect was identified as an important factor for reducing indirect household CO2 emissions.",

By looking into the effect of the cryosphere on human-being, the study develops a unified approach in the analysis of cryospheric risks and services, with one focusing on the adverse impacts by cryospheric hazards and another emphasizing on the benefits that people can obtain from the natural capitals in the cryosphere. Meanwhile, climate change could further alter and complicate the roles of the cryosphere, not only by the changes in risks to cryospheric hazards, but also the changes in services that could potentially add more risks. The study further proposed a risk-based approach for the development of climate adaptation in the cryosphere. The approach essentially takes options to reduce exposure and vulnerability of societies to cryospheric hazards, and to better manage natural capitals and demands together with enhancing utility of the cryosphere, so as to maintain the benefit of cryosphere services in a sustainable way. The study further addresses the role of cryosphere services in strengthening sustainable development in terms of its relation with the sustainable development goals (SDGs), and provides a preliminary results on how the services contributes to SDGs. Overall, the approach developed in this study creates a new way to comprehensively assess the effect of cryosphere changes on our society and identify measures to maximize the benefit while minimizing the risk in relation to the cryosphere.",

    "abstract": "'Co-control', or synergistically reducing CO2 and local air pollutant emissions, is an important strategy for cities to achieve 'low carbon' and 'blue sky' simultaneously. However, there were few studies to evaluate and compare the level of co-control of CO2 and local air pollutants in cities yet. The present study proposed qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate the level of co-control of CO2 and three local air pollutant (SO2, NOx, and particulate matter PM) emissions in key environmental protection cities in China over two periods (2012–2015 and 2015–2018). Statistical analysis found that, though three local air pollutant emissions positively correlated with CO2 emission, no significantly positive correlation was found between local air pollutants emission reductions and CO2 emission reductions, indicating that co-control effects were poor in general. By using the co-control effect coordinate system, qualitative evaluation showed that less than half of the sample cities could achieve co-control of the total amount of CO2 and local air pollutants. By employing the indicator of emission reduction equivalence (EReq), quantitative evaluation showed that the co-control level of the sample cities improved in 2015–2018 compared with 2012–2015. Further regression analysis showed that, reducing coal consumption and economic development significantly enhanced the co-control performance of the observed cities. The present case study proved that the proposed methods for evaluation and comparison of the city co-control performance works well, and can be used in other countries and regions to promote global cities racing to carbon and local air pollutants co-control.",

    "abstract": "A trinomial tree model based on a real options approach was developed to evaluate the investment decisions on carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) retrofitted to the three main types of thermal power plants in China under the same power generation and CO2 emissions levels. The plant types included pulverized coal (PC), integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), and natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plants. We take into account a subsidy policy consistent with the 45Q tax credit of the U.S., as well as uncertainty factors, such as carbon price, technological progress, CO2 geological storage paths, oil price, and electricity price. The results showed that the investment benefit of ordinary NGCC power plants is 93.04 million USD. This provides greater economic advantages than the other two plant types as their investment benefit is negative if the captured CO2 was used for enhanced water recovery (EWR), even if 45Q subsidies are provided. Compared with NGCC + CCUS power plants, PC + CCUS and IGCC + CCUS power plants have more advantages in terms of economic benefits and emission reduction. The 45Q subsidy policy reduced the critical carbon price, which determines the decision to invest or not, by 30.14 USD t−1 for the PC and IGCC power plants and by 15.24 USD t−1 for the NGCC power plants. Nevertheless, only when the subsidy reaches at least 71.84 USD t−1 and the period limit is canceled can all three types of power plants be motivated to invest in CCUS and used the capture CO2 for EWR. Overall, the government should focus on the application of CCUS in coal-fired power plants (in addition to developing gas power generation), especially when CO2 is used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). The government could introduce fiscal policies, such as 45Q or stronger, to stimulate CCUS technology development in China.",

We used a cross-sectional study design to profile the heat exposures of ∼1900 workers from eight industrial sectors using a QuesTemp Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) monitor, quantified select heat-strain indicators viz., rise in Core Body Temperature, Sweat Rate, and Urine Specific Gravity and evaluated the perceived health impacts of heat stress using a structured questionnaire. Heat exposures (average WBGT: 30.1 ± 2.6 °C) exceeded the Threshold Limit Value for 67% workers and was positively associated with the rise in Core Body Temperature >1 °C in 13% and elevated Urine Specific Gravity >1.020 in 9% workers. Heat-related health concerns were reported by 86% workers, and the heat-exposed workers had 2.3 times higher odds of adverse health outcomes compared to unexposed workers (p < 0.0001). Exposure to higher WBGT and adverse renal health among salt-pan workers were significantly associated (p = 0.004), and steel workers had 9% prevalence of kidney stones. Evidence presented clearly points to heat stress as a health and productivity risk factor that could have long-term and irreversible health impacts. In-depth assessments are urgently needed to develop scientifically sound preventative interventions and protective labor policies to avert the adverse occupational health and productivity consequences for millions of workers globally, thereby aiding poverty reduction.",

There is an increased need for an in-depth understanding of the evolution of permafrost temperature (Ttop) and active-layer thickness (ALT) at a fine scale on the QTP under climate change. This study evaluated the permafrost thermal development over the QTP for the period 1980–2100 at a 1 km2 scale using a physically analytical model accounting for both climatic and local environmental factors based on multi-source data. The model results were validated against thermal borehole measurements and baseline maps. The modeled current (2001–2018) permafrost area (Ttop ≤ 0 °C) covers 1.42 × 106 km2 (ca. 56.1% of the QTP land area), 10.1% of which thawed over the historical period 1981–2000. To assess how the ground thermal regime could develop in the future, we utilized the multi-model ensemble mean of downscaled outputs from eight climate models under three Shared Socio-economic Pathways (i.e., SSP126, 245, and 585) in CMIP6 to force the permafrost model. Model results suggest that the current (2001–2018) permafrost extent is likely to dramatically contract in the future period (2021–2100), as indicated by consistent Ttop warming and ALT increasing due to climate changing. About 26.9%, 59.9%, 80.1% of the current permafrost is likely to disappear by the end of the 21st century under SSP126, SSP245, and SSP585 scenarios, respectively. The simulation results may further provide new opportunities to assess the future impacts of climate warming on environments and engineering development over the QTP.",

Bots promote the saliency of energy, climate actions and climate strikes on public agenda. 83.1% of tweets posted by social bots support climate change activism, and 16.9% support climate change skepticism. However, social bot skeptics are more strategical than social bot activists in terms of launching conversations with opposing-minded humans, and avoiding amplification of opposing voices. They are also more successful in inciting opposing-minded humans' initiative conversation and like-minded humans' amplification. Based on the above findings, we suggest cultivating individuals' media literacy in terms of distinguishing malicious social bots as a potential solution to deal with social bot skeptics disguised as humans, as well as making use of benign social bots for science popularization.",

However, current understanding of the influences of permafrost on hydrological dynamics is insufficient. This study investigated historical variations in permafrost conditions and their potential hydrologic effects over the Russian Arctic drainage basin. The results show that soil temperature (at 0.40 m below surface) has increased about 1.4 °C over the Ob, 1.5 °C over the Yenisei, and 1.8 °C over the Lena River basin from 1936 through 2013, possibly resulted in a significant thawing of permafrost. Rapid active layer changes have occurred since the 1970s. The volume of the active layer increased by 28, 142, and 228 km3 over the Ob, Yenisei, and Lena basins, respectively, since the 1970s. Melting ground ice caused by deepening active layer may be a limited contribution to annual runoff. Runoff during freeze season (October–April) showed significant positive correlations (p < 0.05) to active layer thickness in the Yenisei and Lena basins while negative correlation (p > 0.05) in the Ob basin. These results imply that, in basins with high permafrost coverage, a deeper active layer increased soil water storage capacity and perhaps contribute to an increase in winter runoff.",

Precipitation-related extremes has substantial socioeconomic impacts under the changing climate. Quantifying population exposure to precipitation extreme is the fundamental aspect of population risk assessments in the climate hotspot of Indus River Basin. This study investigates the population exposure to precipitation extremes at 1.5 °C, 2.0 °C, and 3.0 °C global warmings in the Indus River Basin using daily precipitation data, and projected population under shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). The Intensity–Area–Duration method was applied to detect the extreme precipitation event by tracing the rainstorm process, calculated based on five downscaled and bias-corrected Global Climate Model (GCM) outputs from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) under four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5). The exposure of the population is finally estimated by combing SSP1 with 1.5 °C, SSP2 with 2.0 °C, and SSP5 with 3.0 °C warming levels. Results show that warming over the Indus River Basin is projected to be higher than that of the global average. Both the extreme precipitation events and population exposure are projected to increase with warming level. With regard to the reference period (1986–2005), the frequency, duration, and impacted area of extreme precipitation are projected to increase by 13.2%, 7.4%, and 1.6% annually under 1.5 °C in the Indus River Basin, respectively. Whereas, an additional 0.5 °C and 1.5 °C warming can lead to further increase in the frequency of 16.6%, 17.3%, as well as the duration of 8.6%, 12%, and areal coverage of 2.1%, 5.3%, respectively. The population exposure to extreme precipitation is projected to increase by 72.4%, 122.7%, and 87.6%, respectively, at SSP1 with 1.5 °C, SSP2 with 2.0 °C and SSP5 with 3.0 °C warming levels compare to the reference period. The demographic change is responsible more for the tremendous increment of population exposure in the Indus River Basin. If the population was held constant to the level of 2010, the increase of population exposure would be 4.4%, 8.8%, and 17.6%, respectively, at 1.5 °C, 2.0 °C, and 3.0 °C warming levels. Spatially, the prominent increment of population exposure is projected in the central and southwestern Indus River Basin. This study highlights that limiting the increase of temperature to 1.5 °C can substantially reduce population exposure to extreme precipitation events in the Indus River Basin, compared to an additional warming. Simultaneously, urge paid to formulate policies on population growth to reduce future exposure.",

    "abstract": "China has pledged to peak carbon emissions by 2030 and neutralize emissions by 2060. There is an urgent need to develop a comprehensive and reliable methodology to judge whether a region has reached its carbon emissions peak (CEP), as well as to schedule and prioritize mitigation activities for different regions. In this study, we developed an approach for identifying the CEP status of 30 provincial areas in China, considering both the carbon emissions trends and the main socioeconomic factors that influence these trends. According to the results of the Mann-Kendall (MK) tests, changes in carbon emissions for the 30 provincial areas can be grouped into four clusters: those with significant reductions, marginal reductions, marginal increases, and significant increases. Then, total energy consumption (TEC), the proportion of coal consumption (PCC), the proportion of the urban population (PUP), the proportion of secondary industry (PASP), and per capita GDP (PGDP) were further identified as the main factors influencing carbon emissions, by applying Redundancy analysis (RDA) and Monte Carlo permutation tests. To balance efficacy with fairness, we assigned scores from 1 to 4 to trends in carbon emissions, and the Group Analysis results of the main influencing factors above except for TEC; for TEC, main basis is the relevant assessment results. And finally, according to the actual condition of total scores, provincial areas were assigned to the first, second, third and fourth stage of progress toward CEP, using the method of Natural Breaks (Jenks). Based on the method, differentiated plans should be adopted from the perspective of fair development and emissions reduction efficiency, in accordance with the basic principles of Doing the Best within Capacity and Common but Differentiated Responsibilities. This classification method can also be adopted by other developing countries which have not yet achieved CEP.",

In this study, we investigated future changes of the Asian summer monsoon under four Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios using 19 CMIP6 models. The intensity of the South Asian summer monsoon (SASM) is projected to decrease by 2.6%, 6.3%, 10.1%, and 11.1%, while the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) intensity is projected to increase by 4.6%, 7.9%, 7.4%, and 9.8% until the end of the 21st century for SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585 scenarios, respectively. Moreover, summer precipitation in Asia is projected to increase remarkably in 2015–2099 under all four scenarios. The inconsistent warming trends over the Tibetan Plateau (TP), Northwest Pacific, and tropical Indian Ocean would greatly impact the monsoon circulations. The upper-troposphere warming trend over the surrounding oceans is remarkably greater than that over the TP, while the near-surface warming trend over the surrounding oceans is smaller than that over the TP. The decrease of upper-troposphere TC between the TP and tropical Indian Ocean results in a weakening of the SASM circulation. The enhancement of the lower-troposphere TC between the TP and Northwest Pacific would strengthen the EASM circulation. Moisture budget analysis shows that the water-vapor would increase in the future, which would thermodynamically enhance summer precipitation through the anomalous vertical moisture transport associated with mean flow. The strengthening of the meridional circulation of the EASM would increase monsoon precipitation, while the weakening of zonal circulation of the SASM would dynamically reduce South Asian summer precipitation.",

Meanwhile, recent observations show that the governance architecture for carbon neutrality is transforming to polycentricity. However, there is still a lack of systematic investigation on carbon neutrality governance under the polycentric approach. Against this background, this study attempts to investigate the emergence and structure of polycentric climate governance, and to figure out to what extent the evolving polycentric system can contribute to the climate change governance towards carbon neutrality. The results show that efforts made by actors at transnational and subnational levels within the polycentric system can greatly complement the deficits of carbon neutrality governance by international regime and state government in many different domains. Besides, the identified issues, that are critical to carbon neutrality including climate legislation, adaptation, technology deployment and data authenticity and transparency, can be addressed in a more effective way through the coordination among multiple actors at multiple levels. Finally, further research should be conducted to address the dynamic linkages between international regimes as well as the issues related to small and medium-sized cities, and develop a comprehensive evaluation and accounting system for the risks and benefits of polycentric climate governance.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decades, droughts and heatwaves frequently appeared in Western Europe (45°–65°N, 10°W–20°E) during boreal summer, causing huge impacts on human society and ecosystems. Although these extremes are projected to increase in both frequency and intensity under a warming climate, our knowledge of their interdecadal variations and causes is relatively limited. Here we show that the droughts and heatwaves in Western Europe have shifted in their trends in the last decade: for 1979–2012, wind speed and precipitation have both strengthened in Western Europe; for 2012–2020, however, Western Europe have experienced declined wind speed, decreased precipitation, and higher air temperature, leading to more frequent droughts and heatwaves there. Recent changes in the WE climate and extremes are related to the variations of the North Atlantic westerly jet stream. In 1979–2012 (2012–2020), the westerly jet stream shifted equatorward (poleward), which enhanced (reduced) transportation of water vapor fluxes from the North Atlantic Ocean to the European land areas, resulting in wetter (drier) surface in Western Europe. Further analysis suggests that phase changes in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation could have played a key role in regulating the position of the jet stream, providing important implications for decadal predictions of the Western Europe summertime climate and weather extremes.",

    "abstract": "Inland waters are important sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the atmosphere that may partially offset the terrestrial carbon sink. However, GHG emissions from high altitude saline lakes on the Tibetan Plateau are currently poorly constrained. In this study, we measured methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations and their carbon stable isotope (δ13C), and calculated diffusive water-to-air fluxes from two saline high-altitude lakes, Qinghai Lake and Hala Lake, located in northeast Tibetan Plateau in October 2020. The two lakes were mostly supersaturated in CH4 (89.8%–4623.9% sat) and acted as sources of CH4 to the atmosphere. Conversely, more than 96% investigated area of Qinghai Lake and all investigated area of Hala Lake was a sink of CO2. The average diffusive fluxes of CH4 and CO2 in the surface waters of Qinghai Lake were 34.51 μmol m−2 d−1 and −1.29 mmol m−2 d−1, while diffusive fluxes of CH4 and CO2 in Hala Lake averaged 5.48 μmol m−2 d−1 and −5.24 mmol m−2 d−1, respectively. Salinity (Sal), fluorescent dissolved organic matter (fDOM), temperature (Temp) and dissolved oxygen (DO) are key factors for diffusive CH4 and CO2 flux in Qinghai Lake and Hala Lake. CH4 diffusive fluxes across water–air interface from Qinghai Lake and Hala Lake were found to be significantly lower than other freshwater lakes, likely due to their saline nature. A simple isotope mixing model (Miller–Tans plots) revealed a distinctly different isotopic source values of CO2 and CH4 in Qinghai Lake and Hala Lake. The CH4 production pathway of Qinghai Lake was mainly by the acetate fermentation, while that of Hala Lake was mainly by the CO2 reduction. The results show that the continuous measurement can help capture the spatial variability of GHGs fluxes in saline lakes.",

    "abstract": "The changes in near-surface wind speed (NWS) have a crucial influence on the wind power industry, and previous studies have indicated that NWS on global and China has declined continuously for decades under global warming. However, recently, the decreasing trend of global NWS has slowed down and even showed a recovery trend. Using the observation data of 831 weather stations of the China Meteorological Administration and the Japanese 55-year reanalysis data from 1970 to 2019, NWS changes in eastern China were analyzed and the possible influencing factors were discussed. Results show that winter NWS presented a decreasing trend from −0.29 m s−1 per decade (p < 0.001) in 1970–1989 to −0.05 m s−1 per decade (p < 0.01) in 1990–2019. Moreover, NWS exhibited a significant upward trend of 0.18 m s−1 per decade (p < 0.1) in 2011–2019, resulting in a 19.6% per decade recovery of the wind power generation. A possible cause is asymmetric changes of the sea level pressure and near-surface air temperature differences between the mid-high latitudes (40°–60°N, 80°–120°E) and low latitudes (20°–40°N, 110°–140°E) altered the horizontal air pressure gradient. Furthermore, NWS changes were closely associated with the large-scale ocean-atmosphere circulations (LOACs). NWS at 77.4% of the stations in eastern China shows significant correlation (p < 0.05) with the East Asian winter monsoon index, besides, the inter/multidecadal variability of NWS was considerably correlated to four LOACs, including Arctic oscillation (AO), North Atlantic oscillation (NAO), Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), and El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The time-series reconstructed by a multiple linear regression model based on above five LOACs matches well with the NWS. Interannual variability of NWS were significantly correlated to AO (−0.45, p < 0.01) and NAO (−0.28, p < 0.05), while the correlation between NWS and ENSO was weak.",

However, challenges remain in data and modelling, meaning that much information is unavailable, especially for the entire Third Pole region. Here, we provided basic statistical data regarding the current state of frozen ground and its changes over the 1960s–2010s across the entire Third Pole by integrating nearly all currently available ground observation data and high-quality spatial data using machine learning models and existing high-quality frozen ground data products. The results show that the current (2000–2018) areal extents of permafrost and seasonally frozen ground in the Third Pole are approximately 1.27 × 106 km2 (1.15 × 106 to 1.39 × 106 km2) and 2.59 × 106 km2, accounting for 28% and 58%, respectively. The areal extent of permafrost region is approximately 50% (23%–93%) larger than that of permafrost area (land underlain by permafrost), especially in some early maps. The corresponding regional average of the mean annual ground temperature is approximately −1.51 °C (−1.75 to −1.27 °C) in the permafrost area. The regional average of active layer thickness overlying the permafrost and the maximum frost depth for regions of seasonally frozen ground are 235 cm (233–237 cm) and 92 cm, respectively. From the 1960s to the 2010s, on average, permafrost in the Third Pole warmed at a rate of 0.17 °C per decade, which was associated with increases in the maximum thaw depth at a rate of 4.42 cm per decade. The regional average of the maximum frost depth declined at a rate of 2.34 cm per decade over the same period. This synthesis highlights the differences between the two terms (permafrost region and permafrost area) and provides crucial information for frozen ground in the Third Pole with higher accuracy for the scientific community and the public.",

However, limited monitored soil temperature data are available to validate the CMIP outputs, resulting in the over-projection of future permafrost changes in CMIP3 and CMIP5. Moreover, future permafrost changes in CMIP6, particularly over the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP), where permafrost covers more than 40% of its territory, are still unknown. To address this gap, we evaluated and calibrated the monthly ground surface temperature (GST; 5 cm below the ground surface), which was often used as the upper boundary to simulate and project permafrost changes derived from 19 CMIP6 Earth System Models (ESMs) against in situ measurements over the QTP. We generated the monthly GST series from 1900 to 2014 for five sites based on the linear calibration models and validated them through the three other sites using the same calibration methods. Results showed that all of the ESMs could capture the dynamics of in situ GST with high correlations (r > 0.90). However, large errors were detected with a broad range of centred root-mean-square errors (1.14–4.98 °C). The Top 5 model ensembles (MME5) performed better than most individual ESMs and averaged multi-model ensembles (MME19). The calibrated GST performed better than the GST obtained from MME5. Both annual and seasonal GSTs exhibited warming trends with an average annual rate of 0.04 °C per decade in the annual GST. The average seasonal warming rate was highest in winter and spring and lowest in summer. This reconstructed GST data series could be used to simulate the long-term permafrost temperature over the QTP.",

Here, using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series and climatic variables, we assessed the desertification dynamics over China's drylands from 1982 to 2016 and explored the climate change impacts, with a particular focus on the influence of the 2015/2016 El Niño event. We found a fluctuant downward trend of barren land area from 1982 to the early 2010s, but followed by a sharp increase afterwards. Decrease in precipitation combined with high temperature are major contributors to the barren land expansion. During the 2015/2016 El Niño, the concurrence of severe drought and heat stress gave rise to the most serious land desertification in the record. Hyper-arid and arid drylands are the predominant contributors to the abrupt barren land area increase during 2015/2016. Our findings, therefore, highlight the climate change impacts on dryland desertification processes. Future dryland expansion and accompanying drought stress may exacerbate the risk of land degradation in these regions.",

The permafrost degradation along the Qinghai–Tibet Highway (QTH) on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau, China, introduces an adverse effect on the deformation of the highway subgrade. At present, observation of a long series of ground temperatures is lacking. From 1995 to 2020, a monitoring system of ground temperature in 10 natural sites along QTH was built and maintained. Ground temperatures at different depths were continuously observed semi-monthly. In this study, permafrost changes along QTH were quantitatively investigated based on these records. The main results showed that both the permafrost table depth (PTD) and ground temperature at different depths exhibited an increasing trend from 1995 to 2020 with widespread spatiotemporal differences. The higher the annual mean and range of PTD were, the higher the increase rate in PTD. The increase rates in PTDs in the warm permafrost regions were 6.18 cm per year larger than those in the cold ones. Overall, the increase rates in ground temperature decreased with the increase in depth at each site. At different depths, the smaller the mean annual ground temperature (MAGT) was, the larger the increase rate in the permafrost temperatures. The larger the range of ground temperatures was, the bigger the increase rate in the permafrost temperatures. At a depth of 6.0 m, the increase rate in the ground temperature in cold permafrost regions was twice that in warm permafrost regions. Information on the magnitudes and differences in permafrost degradation along QTH is necessary for the design of effective adaption strategies for engineering construction and environment protection in permafrost regions under climatic warming.",

    "abstract": "In the summer of 2022, an unprecedented and long-lasting high temperature swept central-eastern China, causing significant societal effects. However, the sub-seasonal characteristics, causes and predictability of this extreme high temperature event are not well explored. Based on the locations, intensities and causes of the high temperature, we divided it into three stages: early (13 June–3 July), sustained (4–28 July), and enhancement (29 July–30 August) stages. The high temperature during the early stage mainly occurred in north-central China with an anomaly of 2.5 °C compared with climatology (1981–2010), while the last two stages occurred in the middle and lower Yangtze River Basin with anomalies of 2.8 and 3.8 °C respectively. The high temperature during the three stages were all regulated by the strengthening and westward extension of the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) but involved different physical process. In the early stage, it was mainly caused by the anticyclones over the Mongolia and Northwest Pacific and enhanced by the minor impact of WPSH. In the sustained stage it was influenced by relatively more stronger WPSH and South Asia high (SAH) and the relatively minor impact of the anticyclone over the north-western South Asia. In the enhancement stage, the high temperature was mainly caused by a combination of the record-breaking WPSH and SAH and the strong European blocking high. Inside, the exceptionally powerful WPSH was well correlated with the sea surface temperature gradient induced by the developing La Niña. The ECMWF and NCEP models reasonably predicted the location and intensity of the high temperature in the early stage, but poorly predicted that in the sustained and enhancement stages partly because of the failure prediction of the WPSH's enhancement and westward extension. The ECMWF model's more accurate prediction of the WPSH may contribute to its better forecasting of the heatwaves.",

    "abstract": "Climate change alters snowpack evolution, which in turn influences the likelihood of snow avalanches and flood risks. The lack of systemic observational data on key snow characteristics in high mountains remains a scientific challenge in terms of systematically elucidating the dynamic chain of variations in climate–snowpack–snow disasters. This restricts our understanding and poses challenges in the prediction of snow-related disaster risks. As such, this study analysed the variations of temperature and snowfall and the physical characteristics of snowpacks based on ground-based observations from the Kunse River Valley situated in the Tianshan Mountains from 1967 to 2021. The results reveal that the temperature increased significantly by 0.32 °C per decade (p < 0.01) during the snow season, along with more extreme snowfall events. The snow-cover duration was observed to have been shortened by 4.77 d per decade (p < 0.01) from 1967 to 2021, which is characterised by later snow-cover onset and earlier snowmelt. Concurrently, average and maximum snow depths increased along with an increase in peak snow water equivalent, thus indicating a higher frequency of extremely scarce or abundant snow years. The low snowpack temperature gradient and earlier snowmelt dates in spring lead to earlier occurrences of snowmelt floods and wet avalanches. As the risks of these events increase, they pose greater threats to farmlands, road transportation, water–electricity infrastructure and several other human activities. Therefore, these insights are critical for providing vital information that can deepen our understanding of the impact of climate change on snowpack characteristics and improve management strategies for snow-related disaster prevention and mitigation.",

    "abstract": "Heatwave exposure has increased dramatically because of climate warming and population growth, along with their interactive effects. However, effective adaptation measures can reduce these impacts. Nonetheless, the dynamic changes, regional inequality in adaptive capacity and their potential contributions to reducing exposure in the future remain unclear. This study quantifies the impact of adaptive capacity and underscores regional variations in heatwave magnitudes, population exposure and adaptation levels in China. We projected the future adaptive capacity using air-conditioner penetration, factoring in climate cooling requirements and individuals' purchasing power. Utilising population and gross domestic product (GDP) data from four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1, SSP2, SSP3 and SSP5) and daily temperature data from four SSP-based emission scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5), we estimated heatwave duration, population exposure and avoided impacts through adaptation across China and its sub-regions. Results show a substantial increase in heatwave duration in Southwest and Southern China, especially under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, with a projection of 163.2 ± 36.7 d during 2081–2100. Under the SSP3|SSP3-7.0 scenario, total exposure reaches 156.4 ± 76.8 billion person d per year, which is the highest among all scenarios and 23 times greater than that in 1986–2005 without adaptation. Upon considering adaptation measures, a noteworthy reduction in population exposure is observed, especially in the SSP3|SSP3-7.0 and SSP5|SSP5-8.5 scenarios, with reductions of (62.6±3.9) % and (65.8±5.1) %, respectively, compared with the scenario without adaptation during 2081–2100. Remarkable regional disparities in avoided impacts are also evident, with variations of up to 50% across different regions. The implementation of effective and environmentally friendly adaptation measures can notably address climate change, thereby alleviating the profound threats posed to human well-being.",

    "abstract": "Freeze‒thaw induced landslides (FTILs) in grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau are a geological disaster leading to soil erosion. However, conventional techniques for regional-scale mapping of FTILs are impractical because they are labor-intensive, expensive, and time-consuming. This study focuses on improving FTILs detection by utilizing image fusion-based Google Earth Engine (GEE) and a random forest algorithm. Integration of various data sources, including texture features, index features, spectral features, slope, and vertical‒vertical polarization data, allow automatic detection of the spatial distribution characteristics of FTILs in Zhidoi county, which is located within the Qinghai‒Tibet engineering corridor (QTEC). We employed statistical techniques to elucidate the mechanisms influencing FTILs occurrence. The image fusion method identifies two schemes that achieve high accuracy using a smaller training sample (scheme A: 94.1%; scheme D: 94.5%) compared to other methods (scheme B: 50.0%; scheme C: 95.8%). This approach is effective generating accurate results using only 10% of the training sample size required for other methods. The spatial distribution patterns of FTILs generated for 2021 are similar to those obtained using various other training sample sources, with a primary concentration observed along the central region traversed by the QTEC. The results highlight slope as the most crucial feature in the fusion images, as it accounts for 93% of FTILs occurring on gentle slopes ranging from 0° to 14°. This study provides a theoretical basis and technological reference for the identification, monitoring, prevention and control of FTILs in grasslands, with the potential to benefit grassland ecosystem management, reduce economic losses, and promote grassland sustainability.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how hydrological factors interrelate is crucial when examining the impact of climate warming on snowmelt. However, these connections are often overlooked, leading to an unclear relationship between temperature and snowmelt. This study investigates the complex interplay between temperature and snowmelt in the Tibetan Plateau from 1961 to 2020, focusing on how extreme high-temperature events affect the frequency of extreme snowmelt. Using a structural equation model, we detected three temperature-related factors that predominantly influenced snowmelt and extreme snowmelt. The annual average temperature was found to have a significant indirect impact on snowmelt, mediated by changes in snowfall, snow depth and snow cover. By contrast, high-temperature days (daily maximum temperatures exceeding the 90th percentile) and heat waves (at least three consecutive high-temperature days) negatively affected extreme snowmelt directly or indirectly. The direct effect of increasing extreme temperature events was associated with an earlier onset of high-temperature periods, which accelerated snowmelt and shortened the duration of extreme snowmelt periods. Additionally, the reduction in snow cover owing to warming emerged as a main factor suppressing snowmelt and extreme snowmelt frequencies. We also revealed spatiotemporal variations in the temperature‒snowmelt relationship that highly depended on changes in snowmelt patterns. The study elucidated why warming suppresses snowmelt and extreme snowmelt events in the Tibetan Plateau, highlighting the mediating roles of snow-related and phenological factors. The findings will provide scientific support for climate simulation and water management policymaking in alpine regions worldwide.",

    "abstract": "The role of hydrogen in the transition to carbon-neutral energy systems will be influenced by key factors such as carbon neutrality pathways, hydrogen production technology costs, and hydrogen transportation costs. Existing studies have not comprehensively analyzed and compared the impact of these key factors on the development of hydrogen supply and demand under China's carbon neutrality pathways. This study uses the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) with an upgraded hydrogen module to evaluate the development potential of China's hydrogen industry, considering various carbon neutrality pathways as well as hydrogen production and transportation costs. The findings indicate that, by 2050, hydrogen could account for 8%‒14% of final energy, averting 1.0‒1.7 Bt of carbon emissions annually at an average mitigation cost of 85‒183$ t−1CO2. The total hydrogen production is projected to reach 75‒135 Mt, with 34%‒56% from renewable energy electrolysis and about 15%‒29% from fossil fuel-based CCS. On a sectoral level, by 2050, the hydrogen demand in the industrial and transportation sectors is expected to reach 37‒63 Mt and 30‒42 Mt, with a potential reduction of about 0.6‒0.9 BtCO2 and 0.5‒0.6 BtCO2. The share of hydrogen in the final energy of the steel and chemical sectors is estimated to be 9%‒19% and 17%‒25%, collectively accounting for 36%‒42% of total hydrogen demand and 46%‒50% of total emission reduction potential. Realizing hydrogen's emission reduction potential relies on the rapid development of hydrogen production, transportation, and utilization technologies. Firstly, the development of on-site electrolysis for hydrogen production and early deployment of industrial hydrogen applications should be prioritized to stimulate overall growth of hydrogen industry and cost reduction. Secondly, vigorous development of renewable energy electrolysis and hydrogen end-use technologies like fuel cells should be pursued, along with the demonstration and promotion of hydrogen transportation technologies. Lastly, further advancement of carbon market mechanisms is essential to support the widespread adoption of hydrogen technologies.",

The observational data from CRUT3v and CN05 were used and further compared with historical simulations of CMIP3. The results show that CMIP5 models were able to simulate the observed warming over China from 1906 to 2005 (0.84°C per 100 years) with a warming rate of 0.77°C per 100 years based on the multi-model ensemble (MME). The simulations of surface air temperature in the late 20th century were much better than those in the early 20th century, when only two models could reproduce the extreme warming in the 1940s. The simulations for the spatial distribution of the 20-year-mean (1986–2005) surface air temperature over China fit relatively well with the observations. However, underestimations in surface air temperature climatology were still found almost all over China, and the largest cold bias and simulation uncertainty were found in western China. On sub-regional scale, northern China experienced stronger warming than southern China during 1961–1999, for which the CMIP5 MME provided better simulations. With CMIP5 the difference of warming trends in northern and southern China was underestimated. In general, the CMIP5 simulations are obviously improved in comparison with the CMIP3 simulations in terms of the variation in regional mean surface air temperature, the spatial distribution of surface air temperature climatology and the linear trends in surface air temperature all over China.

Under the 2 °C target, the GDP loss of China would increase by US$22.0–71.1 billion (equivalent to 16.4–53.1 US$ per capita), the EU's GDP loss would increase by US$9.4–32.1 billion (equivalent to 20.7–71.1 US$ per capita), and Japan's GDP loss will increase by US$4.1–13.5 billion (equivalent to 34.3–111.6 US$ per capita).",

    "abstract": "China has set the goal for its CO2 emissions to peak around 2030, which is not only a strategic decision coordinating domestic sustainable development and global climate change mitigation but also an overarching target and a key point of action for China's resource conservation, environmental protection, shift in economic development patterns, and CO2 emission reduction to avoid climate change. The development stage where China maps out the CO2 emission peak target is earlier than that of the developed countries. It is a necessity that the non-fossil energy supplies be able to meet all the increased energy demand for achieving CO2 emission peaking. Given that China's potential GDP annual increasing rate will be more than 4%, and China's total energy demand will continue to increase by approximately 1.0%–1.5% annually around 2030, new and renewable energies will need to increase by 6%–8% annually to meet the desired CO2 emission peak. The share of new and renewable energies in China's total primary energy supply will be approximately 20% by 2030. At that time, the energy consumption elasticity will decrease to around 0.3, and the annual decrease in the rate of CO2 intensity will also be higher than 4% to ensure the sustained growth of GDP. To achieve the CO2 emission peaking target and substantially promote the low-carbon development transformation, China needs to actively promote an energy production and consumption revolution, the innovation of advanced energy technologies, the reform of the energy regulatory system and pricing mechanism, and especially the construction of a national carbon emission cap and trade system.",

    "abstract": "The characteristics of haze days and the climatic background are analyzed by using daily observations of haze, precipitation, mean and maximum wind speed of 664 meteorological stations for the period of 1961–2012. The results show that haze days occur significantly more often in eastern China than in western China. The annual number of haze days is 5–30 d in most parts of central-eastern China, with some areas experiencing more than 30 d, while less than 5 d are averagely occurring in western China. Haze days are mainly concentrated in the winter half-year, with most in winter, followed by autumn, spring, and then summer. Nearly 20% of annual haze days are experienced in December. The haze days in central-eastern China in the winter half-year have a significant increasing trend of 1.7 d per decade during 1961–2012. There were great increases in haze days in the 1960s, 1970s and the beginning of the 21st century. There was also significant abrupt changes of haze days in the early 1970s and 2000s. From 1961 to 2012, haze days in the winter half-year increased in South China, the middle-lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and North China, but decreased in Northeast China, eastern Northwest China and eastern Southwest China. The number of persistent haze is rising. The Longer the haze, the greater the proportion to the number persistent haze. Certain climatic conditions exacerbated the occurrence of haze. The correlation coefficient between haze days and precipitation days in the winter half-year is mainly negative in central-eastern China. The precipitation days show a decreasing trend in most parts of China, with a rate of around –4.0 d per decade in central-eastern China, which reduces the sedimentation capacity of atmospheric pollutants. During the period of 1961–2012, the correlation coefficients between haze days and mean wind speed and strong wind days are mainly negative in central-eastern China, while there exists positive correlation between haze days and breeze days in the winter half-year. The mean wind speed and strong wind days are decreasing, while breeze days are increasing in most parts of China, which is benefitial to the reduction of the pollutants diffusion capacity. As a result, haze occurs more easily. Song, L.-C., R. Gao, Y. Li, et al., 2014: Analysis of China’s haze days in the winter half-year and the climatic background during 1961–2012. Adv. Clim.

Although precipitation days in northern part were more frequent than in central and southern parts, daily precipitation intensity in the south was generally higher than those in the centre and north of the country. Annual sum of very light precipitation (0 mm < daily precipitation ≤ long-term 50th percentile of daily precipitation more than 0 mm) significantly (p < 0.05) decreased over time, with the highest rate in northern Finland. These decreasing trends might be the result of significant increases in frequency of days with very light precipitation at all the stations, with the highest and lowest rates in northern and southern Finland, respectively. Ratio of annual total precipitation to number of precipitation days also declined in Finland over 1908–2008, with a decreasing north to south gradient. However, annual duration indices of daily precipitation revealed no statistically significant trends at any station. Daily precipitation characteristics showed significant relationships with various well-known atmospheric circulation patterns (ACPs). In particular, the East Atlantic/West Russia (EA/WR) pattern in summer was the most influential ACP negatively associated with different daily precipitation intensity, frequency and duration indices at all three stations studied.",

This paper firstly identifies key factors that influence China's future cement demand, and then uses the Gompertz model to project China's future cement demand and production. Furthermore, the multi-pollutant abatement planning model (MAP) was developed based on the TIMES model to analyze the co-benefits of CO2 and NOx control in China's cement industry. During modeling analysis, three scenarios such as basic as usual scenario (BAU), moderately low carbon scenario (MLC), and radically low carbon scenario (RLC), were built according to different policy constraints and emission control goals. Moreover, the benefits of co-controlling NOx and CO2 emission in China's cement industry have been estimated. Finally, this paper proposes a cost-efficient, green, and low carbon development roadmap for the Chinese cement sector, and puts forwards countermeasures as follows: first, different ministries should enhance communication and coordination about how to promote the co-control of NOx and CO2 in cement industry. Second, co-control technology list should be issued timely for cement industry, and the R&D investment on new technologies and demonstration projects should be increased. Third, the phase-out of old cement capacity needs to be continued at policy level. Fourth, it is important to scientifically evaluate the relevant environmental impact and adverse motivation of ammonia production by NOx removal requirement in cement industry.",

The results show that regions with high flood hazard levels are mainly located in Southeast China, while the vulnerability to flood hazards is high in eastern China. Under the RCP8.5 greenhouse gas emissions scenario, future high flood risk levels will mainly appear in the eastern part of Sichuan, in major part of East China, and in the provinces of Hebei, Beijing, and Tianjin. The major cities in Northeast China, some areas in Shaanxi and Shanxi, as well as the coastal areas in southeastern China will also encounter high flood risks. Compared with the baseline period, the regional flood risk levels will increase towards the end of the 21st century, although the occurrences of floods change little. Due to the coarse resolution of the climate models and the indistinct methodology for determining the weight coefficients, large uncertainty still exists in the projection of flood risks.

Face to face interviews were conducted to collect 1,653 valid questionnaires from Beijing, Shanghai, Shandong province, and Fujian province. A model was constructed to understand the factors that influence WTP. The results indicate that the Chinese public is willing to pay CN¥201.86 annually to support the policy of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Participants from Beijing show the highest WTP, followed by participants from Fujian and Shandong, while those from Shanghai report the lowest WTP. The findings reveal that participants with higher income, higher satisfaction with their current life, and awareness of climate issues are willing to pay more for CO2 emissions reductions. In addition, those who are young, male and members of the Communist Party also indicate a higher WTP. The results imply that translating the public's willingness to protect climate into actions should be taken into account in China's low carbon policy. There is a need to consider the difference in degree of willingness, among different social groups, to pay for emissions reductions if the market-based mechanisms such as carbon tax were designed to facilitate emissions reductions.

Various tests for a wide range of potentially affecting parameters indicated robust and reliable emission estimations by the model. Thus, common uncertainties in input data would still provide good emission estimations. Measurements of dissolved N2O required low maintenance and N2O emission monitoring based on such measurements might therefore be considered as a significant practical improvement.

Results showed that increases of GDP, population, and UPT scale of the cities have speeded up. The most significant development of UPT is that the growth of private vehicles is greatly faster than that of public transportation. The total and per-capita UPT CO2 emissions both increased. The share of private vehicles emission to total UPT CO2 emission has increased, with the share in range of 65%–88% in 2014, exponentially leading to the increases of total and per-capita UPT CO2 emission. Although UPT CO2 emission structure with more share of public transportation would slow down the UPT CO2 emission increase, private vehicle CO2 emission is recognized as the dominated driving factor. Contributions of driving factors, such as GDP, population, private vehicle CO2 emissions, to UPT CO2 emission are different among the cities. Private vehicle CO2 emission is the dominated factor for UPT CO2 emission in Beijing and Taiyuan. Besides private vehicle CO2 emission, GDP also plays an important role in UPT CO2 emissions of Chengdu, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Urumqi. Contributions of private vehicle CO2 emission and GDP to UPT CO2 emission are almost same in Xi'an.",

The conclusions are drawn as follows: (1) The peak of carbon emission in China's power sector will range from 4.0 GtCO2 to 4.8 GtCO2, which implies an increment of 0.5–1.3 billion or 14%–35% from the 2015 levels. (2) Introducing carbon price is an effective way to inhibit coal power and promote non-fossil fuels and Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage applications (CCUS). The carbon emission reduction effects will gradually increase with carbon price. When the carbon price attains to CN¥150 t−1CO2, the CO2 emission can decrease by 36% than that without carbon price. (3) CCUS is one of important contributing factor to reduce CO2 emission in power sector. Generally speaking, the development of non-fossil fuels and energy efficiency improvement are two main drivers for carbon mitigation, but once the carbon price reaches up to CN¥106 t−1CO2, the CCUS will be required to equip with thermal power units and its contribution on carbon emission reduction will remarkably increase. When carbon price increases to CN¥150 t−1CO2 in 2050, the application of CCUS will account for 44% of total emission reduction. (4) In the scenario with carbon price of CN¥150 t−1CO2, power sector would be decarbonized significantly, and the CO2 intensity will be 0.22 kgCO2 (kW h)−1, but power sector is far from the goal that achieving net zero emission. In order to realize the long-term low greenhouse gas emission development goal that proposed by the Paris Agreement, more efforts are needed to be put to further reduce the carbon emission reduction of power sector. Based on the above scenario analysis, the study proposes four recommendations on the low-carbon development of China's power sector: (1) improve the energy efficiency proactively and optimize the energy structure of power sector gradually; (2) promote the low-carbon transition of power sector by using market-based mechanism like carbon emission trading scheme to internalize the external cost of carbon emission; (3) give more emphasis on and support to the CCUS application in power sector.",

The future temperature change is then projected. The results show that the EDCDFm and CDF-t methods function effectively correct the spatial distribution of daily mean temperature and extreme temperature, significantly reduce the biases of the model simulation and effectively improve the capacity of models for spatial pattern of extreme temperature. However, the cold bias of the CDF-t method in winter is obviously higher than that of the EDCDFm method, and the temperature change curve of the EDCDFm method is closer to the observation than that of the CDF-t method. The projection based on the EDCDFm method shows that under the RCP4.5 emission scenario, the temperature in the study area shows a warming trend. Relative to 1986–2005, the mean temperature is projected to increase by 0.76, 1.84, and 2.10 °C during 2017–2036, 2046–2065, and 2080–2099, respectively. The spatial change for the mean, maximum, and minimum temperature in the three future periods have good consistency; warming in northern China is higher than that in the south. Uncertainties in temperature projection are large in the Tibetan Plateau and Sichuan Basin. Frost days decrease significantly, especially in the Tibetan Plateau, and the frost days in the three periods decrease by more than 15, 30, and 40 d, respectively.

    "abstract": "An extreme (weather and climate) event does not only mean that an extreme occurs at a location, but more generally it can impact a certain area and last a certain period of time, which is defined as a regional extreme event (REE) with a certain impacted area and duration. The concept of REE has been defined to allow mainly objective assessment of the events without a pre-determined boundary and duration. This paper reviews the studies on REEs published during the past 20 years, especially recent years. Mainly in view of methodology, these studies can be divided into three types: studies focusing on spatial simultaneity, studies focusing on temporal persistence, and studies identifying REEs. The methods identifying REEs include two kinds, e.g., type-I methods stressing REE's temporal persistence within a relatively certain area and type-II methods focusing on catching a complete REE. Identification methods proposed in this paper could provide valuable information for various purposes, such as real-time monitoring, estimating long-term changes, mechanism diagnosis, forecasting study and even attribution analysis. Research on REEs is important for objectively defining extreme weather and climate events, which depends on the spatial and temporal scales of interest. Such an objective definition will support ongoing climate monitoring and improve the assessment of how regional extreme events have changed over time.",

The results show that the CETP can effectively decrease regional CO2 and SO2 emissions in pilot areas by 19.1% and 37.0% respectively when considering spatial correlation of CO2 and SO2 emissions. From 2014 to 2017, the values of CO2 reduction effect are −0.139, −0.146, −0.187 and −0.206 respectively, indicating the abatement effect increases gradually. CETP can promote 6.1% of the ratio of clean energy consumption and 4.6% of the rate of green technology. In addition, further benefit analysis shows that CETP can improve 12.4% of regional economic output and residents' health by reducing regional CO2 and SO2 emissions, and effectively benefit high-quality economic growth.",

The surface areas of water bodies in the HAYR were processed using mass remote sensing images consisting of Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI, Sentinel-2A, and MODIS based on automatic extraction of water indices under GEE. Besides, the lake ice phenology of the Sister Lakes (the Gyaring Lake and the Ngöring Lake) was derived by threshold segmenting of water/ice area ratio. Results demonstrate that the change of surface areas experienced four stages: decreasing during 1986–2004, increasing during 2004–2012, decreasing again during 2012–2017, and increasing again during 2017–2019. Correspondingly, the number of small lakes decreased (−26.5 per year), increased (139.5 per year), again decreased (−109.0 per year), and again increased (433.0 per year). Eight lakes larger than 1 km2 disappeared in 2004 but restored afterward. The overall trends in the area of small lakes (0.01–1 km2), large lakes (>1 km2), and all lakes during 1986–2019 were 0.4, 3.1, and 3.4 km2 per year, respectively. Although the onsets of freezing, freeze-up, breaking and the break-up of the Sister Lakes varied from year to year, there is no obvious trend regarding the lake ice phenology. Tendencies of lake variations in the HAYR are primarily related to the increased net precipitation and the declined aridity, followed by the construction of hydropower station around the outlet of the Ngöring Lake, as well as permafrost degradation.",

    "abstract": "The rapid warming of the Arctic has led to permafrost degradation, accelerating the transport of terrestrial materials by rivers. The quantitative assessment of riverine nutrients and total suspended solids (TSS) flux is important to clarify the land–ocean connections in the Arctic. However, much is unknown about the estimates of these components from direct measurements in the Arctic rivers and the response of the components to permafrost degradation. Here, we report the results from the Arctic Great Rivers Observatory (Arctic-GRO) for the six major Arctic rivers (Yenisey, Lena, Ob', Mackenzie, Yukon, and Kolyma) to investigate the riverine exports of TSS, total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), nitrate (NO3−), bicarbonate (HCO3−), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), and phosphate (PO43−). The results showed that from 2004 to 2017, the annual TSS, TDN, and NO3− exports to the Arctic Ocean were approximately 106,026 Gg, 692 Gg, and 130 Gg, respectively, and the HCO3−, TDP, and PO43− exports were approximately 79,092 Gg, 32 Gg, and 18 Gg, respectively. There were remarkable variations in component concentrations and fluxes between seasons. More than 80% of the TDN, TDP, PO43−, and TSS exports mainly occurred in spring and summer, and a high HCO3− flux was recorded in summer, while a high NO3− flux in some rivers occurred in winter. The active layer thickness was significantly positively correlated with the annual TDN, NO3−, and HCO3− exports. In addition, the HCO3− flux of the six Arctic rivers increased by 247 Gg per year during 2004–2017. The positive relationship between the active layer thickness and river discharge indicates that permafrost degradation accelerated riverine carbonate, nitrogen, and phosphorus exports. This study demonstrates that riverine exports play an important role both in the Arctic terrestrial and marine ecosystems, and permafrost degradation will likely increase the riverine material exports to the ocean.",

It is generally believed that global warming drives increase in frequency, intensity and duration of climate extremes, and socioeconomic exposure plays a dominant role in climate impacts. In order to promote climate risk governance at regional level, the historical and projected trends in the population exposure to climate extremes are quantified in eastern China using downscaled climate simulations and population growth scenarios. The frequency of temperature extremes (tx35days) is projected to more than double by 2050 in nearly half of prefecture-level cities in eastern China, leading to an 81.8% increment of total exposure under SSP2-4.5 scenario. The increasing trend is also detectable in the frequency of precipitation extremes (r20mm) in eastern China, and the exposure increment is projected to be 22.9% by 2050, with a near equivalent contributions of both climate change and population growth. Spatially, temperature exposure mainly grows in southern Hebei, western Shandong and inland Guangdong provinces, while precipitation exposure raises principally in southeast coastal areas of China. Based on the historical baseline and projected amplification of population exposure, we identify some hotspot cities such as Guangzhou, Shanghai, Dongguan and Hangzhou that response to climate change dramatically and confront greater potential risk of climate extremes in the coming future.",

First, we found that the ETS pilots significantly increase profit variability (total risk) in China's industry; that is, ETS induces greater uncertainty in the covered sectors. In terms of industry heterogeneity, non-electricity sectors (specifically ferrous metal) engage in higher levels of risk taking. Second, the influence of such program features as the allowance allocation (total amounts and approaches), China Certification Emission Reduction (CCER) trading volumes, and penalties are heterogeneous. Finally, during the period around the treatment, industry risk can significantly encourage longer rather than shorter investment. In particular, the punishment mechanism and benchmarking allocation play a positive role in regulating the risk–investment relationship.",

    "abstract": "Extreme heat events (EHEs) have a significant impact on the social economy and human health. China is a country with a large population and diverse terrain, and it is necessary to project future extreme heat changes in the sub-regions. This study used a specially designed dataset, the Community Earth System Model (CESM) simulations, namely CESM low-warming, to investigate the EHEs in China under 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C global warming. The results indicate that the regional mean warming over China will exceed the global average, about 1.63 °C and 2.24 °C in 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C warmer futures. Compared to the present-day (1976–2005), the frequency and duration of the EHEs in South China are projected to increase the most among the sub-regions. For example, the frequency of EHEs in South China at 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C warming will exceed 3 and 3.5 times the present-day level. However, when global warming rises from 1.5 °C to 2.0 °C, the increased impacts relative to the 1.5 °C warming level will be the lowest in South China (less than 40%), and the highest increased impacts are projected to appear in Northeast China (53%–84%) and Northwest China (53%–107%). The main reason for this situation is that compared with the 1.5 °C scenario, the upper zonal westerly in northern China weakens and the continental high pressure enhances under the 2.0 °C scenario. Therefore, limiting global warming at 1.5 °C instead of 2.0 °C is beneficial for eliminating extreme heat events, especially for Northeast China and Northwest China.",

Climate models of the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) show a much stronger Arctic warming signal but with a larger inter-model spread. In this study, we find that the projected Arctic warming made by multi-models in CMIP6 is positively correlated with the simulated global warming trend during the period of 1981–2011 in historical runs. This enables us to tighter constraints to future warming in the Arctic by using the observed global warming during the instrument era. The fact that CMIP6 models tend to overestimate the trend of global mean surface temperature during 1981–2011, therefore, would imply a relative weak Arctic warming compared to the CMIP6 median warming projection.",

    "abstract": "Snow properties and their changes are crucial to better understanding of hydrological processes, soil thermal regimes, and surface energy balances. Reliable data and information on snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE) are also crucial for water resource assessments and socio-economic development at local and regional scales. However, these data are extremely limited and unreliable in northern Xinjiang, China. This study thus aims to investigate spatial variations of snow depth, SWE, and snow density based on winter snowfield surveys during 2015 through 2017 in the Altai Mountains, northwestern China. The results indicated that snow depth (25–114 cm) and SWE (40–290 mm) were greater in the alpine Kanas-Hemu region, and shallow snow accumulated (9–42 cm for snow depth, 26–106 mm for SWE) on the piedmont sloping plain. While there was no remarkable regional difference in the distribution of snow density. Snow property distributions were strongly controlled by topography and vegetation. Elevation and latitude were the most important factors affecting snow depth and SWE, while snow density was strongly affected by longitude across the Altai Mountains in China. The influence of topography on snow property distributions was spatially heterogenous. Mean snow depth increased from 13.7 to 31.2 cm and SWE from 28.5 to 79.9 mm, respectively, with elevation increased from 400 to 1000 m a.s.l. on the piedmont sloping plain. Snow depth decreased to about 15.1 cm and SWE to about 28.5 mm from 1000 to 1800 m a.s.l., then again increased to about 98.1 cm and 271.7 mm on peaks (∼2000 m a.s.l.) in the alpine Kanas-Hemu. Leeward slopes were easier to accumulate snow cover, especially on north-, east-, and southeast-facing slopes. Canopy interception was also the cause of the difference in snow distribution. Snow depth, SWE, and snow density in forests were reduced by 8%–53%, 2%–67% and −4% to +48%, respectively, compared with surrounding open areas. Especially when snow depth was less than 40 cm, snow depth and SWE differences in forests were more exaggerated. This study provides a basic data set of spatial distributions and variations of snow depth, SWE and snow density in the Altai Mountains, which can be used as an input parameter in climate or hydrological models. These first-hand observations will help to better understand the relationship between snow, topography and climate in mountainous regions across northern China and other high-mountain Asian regions.",

Taking 832 poverty-stricken counties in China as samples, this study proposed an integrity suitability index (ISI) based on natural and socioeconomic factors to evaluate the suitability and potential of developing ice-and-snow tourism in poverty-stricken counties. The results showed that there are significant differences between the spatial distributions of the suitability of glacier- and ski-related tourism. The former is mainly distributed in the Qinghai‒Tibet Plateau, while the latter is distributed in low-altitude mountainous areas. Additionally, 36.0% of the total number of poverty-stricken counties have the potential to match medium-to high-level ISIs of ice-and-snow tourism, of which 2.5%, 32.9% and 0.2% are suitable for glacier excursions, ski sports and both, respectively. Furthermore, climate change and environmental protection are the main constraints on the development of ice-and-snow tourism and corresponding development strategies are proposed.

The overall trend is of shrubland and tree lines moving northwards, while changes in different land cover types and vegetation growth in response to climate change are largely unknown. Here, we selected land areas with latitudes higher than 50°N as the study area. We compared the land cover type changes and explored relationships between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values of different land cover types, air temperature, and precipitation during 1982–2015 based on dynamic grid. The results indicated that forest and shrubland areas increased as a large area of grassland shifted to forest and shrubland. The snow/ice, tundra and grassland largely have decreased from 1982 to 2015. Although approximately 277.3 × 103 km2 of barren land (6.2% of the total barren land area in 1982) changed to tundra, the tundra area still decreased because some tundra shifted to forest and grassland. The NDVI values of tundra significantly increased, but the shrubland showed a decreasing trend. Temperature in the growing season (June to September) showed the largest positive correlation coefficients with the NDVI values of forest, tundra, grassland, and cropland. However, due to shrubification processes and plant mortality in shrubland areas, the shrubland NDVI showed negative relationship with annual temperature but positively correlated with monthly t. Taken together, although there is large room for improvement of the land cover type data accuracy, our results suggested that the land cover types in high-latitude regions changed significantly, while the NDVI values of the different land cover types showed different responses to climate change.",

    "abstract": "Globally, mountains are often characterized as fragile and hazardous terrains, with vast areas covered by the cryosphere. The livelihoods of communities in the Hindu Kush Himalayan region are closely linked with the cryosphere. But over the past few decades, communities in the region have experienced multiple changes, including those driven by climat e change, with direct and immediate impacts on their lives and livelihoods. In this study, we explore linkages between the cryosphere and high-mountain livelihoods using a social‒ecological system approach. It examines how the complex social‒ecological system in villages in Langtang Valley, Nepal, has evolved in response to both cryospheric and socioeconomic changes. The local communities perceive gradual but significant changes in the cryospheric system, such as receding and thinning glaciers, changing snowfall patterns, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, and a growing incidence of cryosphere-related hazards, such as avalanches and landslides. Communities in the Langtang Valley are also facing a number of socioeconomic changes, resulting in changing aspirations, particularly among the youth. The growing disconnection between society and the surrounding cryosphere, with direct impacts on the transfer and growth of local knowledge systems, are discussed. These simultaneous changes in the cryosphere and the socioeconomic domain have also resulted in a homogenization of livelihood sources, with tourism emerging as the dominant source of livelihood. This has resulted in a dependence of the local population on food imported from outside the valley. A growing dependence on tourism for livelihoods, dependence on imports for food and other basic needs, and the lack of a risk reduction strategy might pose great risks for local lives and livelihoods in the long run. Interventions pertaining to diversifying livelihoods, harmonizing social capital, and hazard risk assessment are essential for strengthening linkages between cryosphere and the socioeconomic system.",

We ran simulations of the Common Land Model (CoLM) to obtain the photosynthetic rate, and used the satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), to which we applied a temporal sensitivity analysis, the slope change ratio of accumulative quantity (SCRAQ), and geographical detectors. We show that the discrepancy between warming and precipitation variation contributed to vegetation activity was more notable than the ecosystem sensitivity to hydrothermal conditions, regardless of which temporal and spatial scale was considered. The sensitivity of vegetation activity to hydrothermal variation in most parts of northeastern and western China was higher than elsewhere, and the contribution of warming to vegetation dynamics was relatively high in the Inner Mongolian Plateau and Tibetan Plateau (>60%), where the contribution of warming to the vegetation distribution was also greater than elsewhere in China. Conversely, the contribution of precipitation variation to vegetation dynamics was comparatively greater in northwestern China and subtropical and tropical regions (>55%). The spatiotemporal contribution of precipitation variation to vegetation activity differed between regions, especially on the Tibetan Plateau and in subtropical and tropical regions. Moreover, both the temporal and spatial sensitivities to climate change were weak in the subtropical and tropical regions, where the contribution of climatic factors to vegetation distribution was also small. Overall, temperature sensitivity and its contribution to vegetation activity were positively associated in most regions. However, the regions where precipitation contributed substantially to vegetation activity were not necessarily also highly sensitive to changes in precipitation within the range of variation explored.",

It requires economic recovery without compromising on the environment, implying a critical role that green productivity plays in achieving the carbon neutrality goal. Green productivity measures the quality of economic growth with consideration for energy consumption and environmental pollution. This study employs the slacks-based measure directional distance function (SBM-DDF) approach and the Malmquist-Luenberger (ML) index to calculate green productivity and its components of 30 provinces in China between 2001 and 2018. Using a spatial panel data model, we empirically analyzed the conditional β-convergence of China's green productivity. We found that overall, since 2001, China's green productivity has demonstrated a continuous upward trend. When taking into account spatial factors, China's green productivity demonstrates a significant conditional β-convergence. In terms of regional effects, the results indicate that the green productivity of the eastern and western regions demonstrates club convergence, implying a more balanced green economic development. Moreover, the convergence rate of China's green productivity increases with the addition of environmental regulation variable, and so the corresponding convergence time decreases. It indicates that environmental regulations help to facilitate the convergence of China's green productivity, narrowing the gap between the regional green economic development. The findings provide guideline for achieving a low-carbon development and carbon neutrality from a regional green productivity perspective.",

    "abstract": "Global warming is causing glaciers to retreat and glacial lakes to expand in the Himalayas, which amplifies the risk of glacial lake outburst debris flows (GLODFs) and poses a significant threat to downstream lives and infrastructures. However, the complex interplay between GLODF occurrences and associated indicators, coupled with the lack of a comprehensive susceptibility indicator system that considers the entire GLODF process, presents a substantial challenge in assessing GLODF susceptibility in the Himalayas. This study proposes a process-driven GLODF susceptibility assessment indicator system responding to climate change that considers the complete process of GLODF formation, incorporating relevant parameters about upstream, themselves, and downstream of glacial lakes. Furthermore, to mitigate subjective factors associated with traditional evaluation methods, we developed three novel hybrid machine-learning models by integrating classic machine-learning algorithms with the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) to delineate the distribution of GLODF susceptibility in the Himalayas. All the hybrid models effectively predicted the GLODFs occurrence, with the WOA-SVC model demonstrating the highest prediction accuracy. Approximately 34% of the catchments exhibit high and very high susceptibility levels, primarily concentrated along the north and south sides of the Himalayan ridge, particularly in the eastern and central Himalayas. Indicators capturing the physical formation process of hazards, such as topographic potential (highest relative importance value of 40%), can precisely identify GLODF. A total of 128 catchments pose potential transboundary threats, with 24 classified as having a very high susceptibility level and 25 as having a high susceptibility level. Notably, the border region between China and Nepal is a prominent hotspot for transboundary threats of GLODF. These findings can provide valuable clues for disaster prevention, mitigation, and cross-border coordination in the Himalayas.",

    "abstract": "Alpine vegetation plays an important role in the thermal stability of the permafrost under a warming climate, as it affects ground hydrothermal dynamics. The response of soil hydrothermal dynamics in the active layer to permafrost degradation under different alpine grassland types is unclear on the Qinghai‒Tibet Plateau. In this study, long-term soil temperature and soil water content in the active layer were monitored in situ from October 2010 to December 2018 at five sites in the Kaixinling permafrost region on the interior Qinghai‒Tibet Plateau along the Qinghai–Tibet Railway. The sites included an alpine steppe (AS), three alpine meadows (AM) with different degrees of degraded vegetation, and an alpine swamp meadow (ASM). Based on field-monitored data, the variations in soil temperature, soil water content, and freeze–thaw processes were examined in the active layer. The response characteristics of the soil hydrothermal processes to climate change were analysed under the different alpine grasslands. The results showed that the duration of the thawing and freezing stages of the active layer of the AMs was shorter than that of the ASM and the AS. The average mean annual soil temperature (MAST) in the active layer of the AM ((−1.25 ± 0.50) °C) was lower than those in the AS ((−0.71 ± 0.39) °C) and ASM ((−0.45 ± 0.57) °C), while the AM had the highest rate of soil temperature increase ((0.2 ± 0.06) °C per year). The annual amplitude of ground temperature in the active layer increased with the transition direction of the alpine vegetation type from ASM to AM to AS. The small surface offset (SO) and thermal offset (TO) (absolute values) indicated that the ground thermal state of the AM was more unstable, as it was more sensitive to the increase in air temperature than the ASM or the AS. Soil properties controlled the distribution of soil water content within the active layer, but vegetation improved the shallow soil structure by producing more belowground phytomass, thus, enhancing soil water content in the 0–30 cm layer. The average soil water content at depths of 0–30 cm was directly proportional (p < 0.05) to the phytomass. Soil water contents at depths of 0–30 cm in the ASM ((37.7 ± 5.3)%) and the AM ((40.8 ± 5.9)%) were significantly higher than those in the AS ((22.7 ± 3.2)%). These results provide valuable insight into the hydrothermal interactions between the degradation of permafrost and alpine vegetation under a warming climate.",

The results show that the reconstructed datasets have a good representation of the ST change trends in the Arctic. In 1900–2020, the annual warming trends in the Arctic (0.17 ± 0.031 and 0.14 ± 0.025 °C per decade under the Imax and Imin reconstruction, respectively) are roughly 1.6–1.8 times the global mean warming trends (0.10 ± 0.008 and 0.09 ± 0.008 °C per decade).

The objective of this study is to explore the role of local extreme weather in advancing Chinese people's climate change awareness. Whether local extreme weather functions as an opportunity to trigger the public's interest in climate change across China and whether the local online information environment resonances with extreme weather by providing climate change news feeds have been examined by a combination of city-level meteorological warnings and search engine data. The results have verified that residents from 50 of the 360 cities show increasing concern for climate change when an extreme weather event occurs locally; however, only the online information environment of two cities echoes local extreme weather by providing more information about climate change or global warming. Correlations between extreme weather events such as heavy rain, an extreme weather event that has occurred in China, and climate change are underestimated. The effect of extreme cold events and snowfall on climate change awareness should also be noted more in China. This study suggests there is still a lot of room for improvement regarding both increasing and satisfying the public's pre-existing climate change-related concerns. A promising approach would be adopting climate change prevention and adaptation as a news report framework for extreme weather events.",

    "abstract": "High temperature and high humidity pose notable threats to the health and survival of humans, and the impact of compound extreme events involving multiple meteorological elements is usually greater than the sum of the impacts of individual extreme events. However, there is limited research on the compound extreme meteorological events, defined based on the extreme of health risks rather than just the extreme of meteorological elements, necessitating further investigation into their characteristics and underlying driving factors. Using daily records of emergency ambulance dispatches from selected Chinese cities, together with daily average temperature and relative humidity data, this study identified and quantified warm‒wet compound extreme events with high health risks (HRWWs) that occurred in southern China during 1979–2022. Results revealed that HRWWs were most prevalent in the coastal region of southern China. The annual frequency of HRWWs across China underwent a marked shift in 2014, with the rapid increase in recent years primarily contributed by the increase in summer HRWWs and advance and extension of the period of occurrence of HRWWs in summer. Further analysis indicated that the changes in HRWWs in southern China during summer were primarily regulated by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) of the preceding winter and the springtime Indian Ocean basin-wide (IOBW) mode. El Niño and Indian Ocean warming force a reverse Walker circulation in the tropical Indian Ocean‒western Pacific, strengthening the Philippine anticyclone (PAC) in summer. This weakens convection in the northwestern Pacific and enables the western Pacific subtropical high to extend westward over coastal areas of southern China. The resulting abnormal atmospheric circulation causes prevailing subsidence over southern China, which is unfavorable for precipitation but conducive to maintaining high surface temperatures. Despite reduced precipitation, water vapor flux is increased owing to strengthened southwesterlies associated with the PAC that enhance regional humidity. Consequently, as temperature and humidity levels rise, HRWWs occur more frequently in southern China, as evidenced since 2014. Further analysis suggested that the contribution of intensification of IOBW warming to the sudden increase in HRWW occurrence over the past decade has been greater than that of ENSO.",

Results show that the impacts of LUCC on diurnal temperature range (DTR) are more significant than on mean surface air temperature. The global average annual DTR change due to LUCC is −0.1°C, which is three times as large as the mean temperature change. LUCC influences regional DTR as simulated by the model. In the mid-latitudes, LUCC leads to a decrease in DTR, which is mainly caused by the reduction in daily maximum temperature. However, there are some differences in the low latitudes. The reduction in DTR in East Asia is mainly the result of the decrease in daily maximum temperature, while in India, the decrease in DTR is due to the increase in daily minimum temperature.

    "abstract": "In the last half century, a significant warming trend occurred in summer over eastern China in the East Asian monsoon region. However, there were no consistent trends with respect to the intensity of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) or the amount of summer rainfall averaged over eastern China. Both of the EASM and summer rainfall exhibited clear decadal variations. Obvious decadal shifts of EASM occurred around the mid- and late 1970s, the late 1980s and the early 1990s, and the late 1990s and early 2000s, respectively. Summer rainfall over eastern China exhibited a change in spatial distribution in the decadal timescale, in response to the decadal shifts of EASM. From the mid- and late 1970s to the late 1980s and the early 1990s, there was a meridional tri-polar rainfall distribution anomaly with more rainfall over the Yangtze River valley and less rainfall in North and South China; but in the period from the early 1990s to the late 1990s and the early 2000s the tri-polar distribution changed to a dipolar one, with more rainfall appearing over southern China south to the Yangtze River valley and less rainfall in North China. However, from the early 2000s to the late 2000s, the Yangtze River valley received less rainfall. The decadal changes in EASM and summer rainfall over eastern China in the last half century are closely related to natural internal forcing factors such as Eurasian snow cover, Arctic sea ice, sea surface temperatures in tropical Pacific and Indian Ocean, ocean–atmospheric coupled systems of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and Asian–Pacific Oscillation (APO), and uneven thermal forcing over the Asian continent. Up to now, the roles of anthropogenic factors, such as greenhouse gases, aerosols, and land usage/cover changes, on existing decadal variations of EASM and summer rainfall in this region remain uncertain.",

Similarly, the models consistently show that the average SAT over China would most likely increase by 2.4–2.7 °C under the 2.0 °C target. Furthermore, the warming shows a clear spatial distinction over China: being stronger in the northwest part and weaker in the southeast part. Under all RCP pathways, the SAT over the northwest part would increase by 1.9–2.1 °C for the 1.5 °C target, which is much stronger than the SAT increase over the southeast part (1.3–1.5 °C).

The model results showed that the global ocean will continue to absorb atmospheric CO2. Global mean surface ocean temperature will rise 1.1–2.8 K at the end of the 21st century across RCP scenarios. Meanwhile, the global mean surface ocean pH will drop 0.14–0.42 and the ocean surface mean concentration of carbonate will decrease 20%–51% across the RCP scenarios. The saturated state of sea water with respect to calcite carbonate minerals (Ω) will decrease rapidly. During the pre-industrial period, 99% of the shallow-water coral reefs were surrounded by seawater with Ω > 3.5 and 87% of the deep-sea coral reefs were surrounded by seawater with aragonite supersaturation. Within the 21st century, except for the high mitigation scenario of RCP2.6, almost none shallow-water coral reefs will be surrounded by seawater with Ω > 3.5. Under the intensive emission scenario of RCP8.5, by the year 2100, the aragonite saturation horizon will rise to 308 m under the sea surface from 1138 m at the pre-industrial period, thus 73% of the cold-water coral reefs will be surrounded by seawater with aragonite undersaturation.

Nevertheless, the real ecosystem service values and their complete zoning system in the permafrost regions have received insufficient attention. Research gaps between the identification of permafrost-based ecosystem services and ecosystem management are seriously constraining the development of cryospheric science. Thus, an ecosystem service zoning framework that links ecosystem services with human welfares is proposed to solve the abovementioned challenges in the permafrost regions of China. The three-tiered zoning framework for ecosystem services, consisting of zoning goals, principles, hierarchy, methodology, and nomenclature, is proposed for the permafrost regions of China. A combined method, i.e., GIS spatial tools, the location entropy analysis model, and ecosystem services assessment, was employed to distinguish ecosystem conditions, ecosystem service supply, and beneficiaries into these three-grade ecosystem service zones. Hierarchical and dynamic zoning could clarify protection priorities of ecosystems and ecosystem services in terms of regions, grades, and types. The framework could contribute to sustainable management of ecosystem services in the cryosphere.",

The Polesgo's landfill was composed of four zones: Phase I, II, Phase III, and SP. The surface of Phase I was fully covered and its conditions are better for surface emission measurements. As results concerning the Phase I zone, the geospatial means flux rates of CH4 (657 mg m−2 h−1 in 2017 and 1210 mg m−2 h−1 in 2018, respectively) are measured higher than the tolerable value reported in literature. The emitted CH4 or CO2 have permitted to locate higher surface emissions which are related to the cover state. The calculated gas collection efficiency (27.4% in 2017 and 23.0% in 2018) is low compared to those reported for landfills integrating landfill gas (LFG) extraction system.

Based on the safety record and situation of the existing power plants in China, the current status of the development of world nuclear power technology, and the features of the independently designed advanced power plants in China, this paper aims to demonstrate the safety of nuclear power. A nuclear power plant will not cause harm either to the environment and nor to the public according to the real data of radioactivity release, which are obtained from an operational nuclear plant. The development of nuclear power technology can enhance the safety of nuclear power. Further, this paper discusses issues related to the nuclear fuel cycle, the treatment, and disposal strategies of nuclear waste, and the decommissioning of a nuclear power plant, all of which are issues of public concern.",

Compared with observations, the CMIP5 models simulate the linear trend and spatial distribution of the annual mean surface air temperature (SAT) better in the north (NBR) and south (SBR) of the Belt and Road region. The trend of the 22-model ensemble mean (CMIP5 MME) is 0.70/0.50 °C per 100 years from 1901 to 2005, and the observed trend is 1.11/0.77 °C per 100 years in the NBR/SBR region. After 1971, the relative error between CMIP5 MME and observations is 22%/15% in the NBR/SBR region. Seven/nine models are selected in the NBR/SBR to project future SAT changes under three RCP scenarios. For 2081–2100, warming in the NBR/SBR is projected to be (1.16 ± 0.29)/(0.72 ± 0.32) °C, (2.41 ± 0.54)/(1.55 ± 0.44) °C, and (5.23 ± 1.02)/(3.33 ± 0.65) °C for RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5, respectively. Under the RCP scenarios, the NBR region shows greater warming than the SBR region. The most significant warming is expected in Kazakhstan and the northern part of the SBR. The associated uncertainty generally increases with time under the three RCP scenarios. Furthermore, increases in warming over the Belt and Road region are more remarkable under higher-emission scenarios than lower-emission ones.",

The analysis infers that thermokarst lake can transfer heat to permafrost under the embankment, as a heat resource, and the heat flux decreases with the distance away from thermokarst lake in horizontal and vertical direction. Thermokarst lake can cause average ground temperature of permafrost under the embankment increasing, and with less distance from the thermokarst lake the temperature increases more severely.

    "abstract": "In recent years, there have been considerable developments in energy provision with the growing improvements in energy supply security and support systems in China. However, China's energy system continues to retain a high-carbon feature where coal dominates energy production and consumption, which has led to the rapid growth of greenhouse gas emissions and associated serious environmental pollution. It has therefore become an important task for China to consider how to promote the low-carbon development of energy system. This paper summarized the basic trends and challenges for development of low-carbon energy system in China and studied the primary energy consumption and carbon emissions in different scenarios at 10-year intervals between 2010 and 2050. The analysis showed that controlling coal consumption will have an important influence on the control of total carbon emissions and of carbon emission peaking; promotion of non-fossil fuel energies will offer a growing contribution to a low-carbon transition in the medium and long term; the development of carbon capture, utilization, and storage will play a key role in realizing a deep decarbonization pathway, particularly after 2030; and the establishment of a low-carbon power system is crucial for the achievement of low-carbon energy transition. Finally, the strategic considerations and policy suggestions on the development of low-carbon energy systems in China are explored.",

Geladaindong and analyzed using a Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) provides the first long-term (1843–1982) record of BC from the central Tibetan Plateau. Post 1940 the record is characterized by an increased occurrence of years with above average BC, and the highest BC values of the record. The BC increase in recent decades is likely caused by a combination of increased emissions from regional BC sources, and a reduction in snow accumulation. Guoqu glacier has received no net ice accumulation since the 1980s, and is a potential example of a glacier where an increase in the equilibrium line altitude is exposing buried high impurity layers. That BC concentrations in the uppermost layers of the Geladaindong ice core are not substantially higher relative to deeper in the ice core suggests that some of the BC that must have been deposited on Guoqu glacier via wet or dry deposition between 1983 and 2005 has been removed from the surface of the glacier, potentially via supraglacial or englacial meltwater.",

Many studies on drought in CA, as a whole, have been carried out, whereas there is a lack of studies on the drying and wetting trends of different climatic zones within CA. In this study, CA was divided into three different climatic zones based on the Köppen climate classification method, precipitation climatology, and aridity index. These were the temperate continental (Df), dry arid desert (BW), and Mediterranean continental (Ds) climatic zones. The regional drying and wetting trends during the years 1961–2015 were investigated using the monthly gridded Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The empirical orthogonal function (EOF) was applied to analyze spatial and temporal variation patterns. EOF mode 1 (EOF1) analysis found increasingly wet conditions throughout CA over the duration of the study, and EOF mode 2 (EOF2) analysis found a contrast between northern and southern CA: as Df became drier and BW and Ds became wetter. EOF mode 3 (EOF3) analysis found a western and eastern inverse phase distribution. The SPEI displayed a decreasing trend from 1961 to 1974 for CA as a whole, before increasing from 1975 to 2015, with a particularly significant increase over the first seven years of that period. On a regional scale, the BW and Ds zones experienced a wetting trend due to increased precipitation during 1961–2015, but the Df zone experienced a drying trend due to reduced evapotranspiration and an increasing temperature, particularly from 1961 to 1978. Thus, the spatio-temporal patterns in dryness and wetness across CA can be categorized according to climatic regions.",

We aim to compare the differences in surface air temperature (SAT) between observational that has been adjusted for urbanization bias and reanalysis data (NCEPV1, NCEPV2, ERA5, CFSR, MERRA, JRA55, 20CRV3 and CRA40) over mainland China during 1961–2015. The main results are presented as follows. The correlation and standard deviation between the reanalysis data and observations exhibit highly consistent interannual variability and dispersion, with the interannual SAT variability in JRA55 being closest to the observations for 1961–2015 and that of ERA5 for 1979–2015; the dispersions of 20CRV3 is most consistent with the observations for 1961–2015 and that of NCEPV1 for 1979–2015. Although annual mean SAT of the reanalysis is generally 0–2.0 °C lower than the observations, the bias in the SAT climatology of 20CRV3 is the least for 1961–2015 in all reanalysis datasets and that of CRA40 is the least for 1979–2015. The trends of NCEPV1 is closer to the observations than other reanalysis for 1961–2015 and that of 20CRV3 for 1979–2015. The biases in terms of interannual variability, dispersion, climatology, and linear trend are increase with altitude. Overall, in terms of the similarity of multiple measures to the urbanization bias-adjusted observations, JRA55 and CRA40 show the best performances for the periods 1961–2015 and 1979–2015 respectively in reproducing various aspects of climatological and climate change features in mainland China.",

    "abstract": "To provide a scientific basis for the policies for the development of wind energy and towards the goal of carbon neutrality in China and local governments, changes in wind energy potential over China were investigated based on the bias-corrected ensemble mean (CENS) of high-resolution dynamical downscaling projections using the RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. Firstly, evaluation indicated that CENS could better reproduce the long-term mean and interannual variability of surface wind speed over China compared to the original simulation outputs, providing a reliable basis for future projections. Projection of the averaged wind power density of China showed a decreasing trend during 2020–2099 in all four seasons under all three scenarios, with the significant (p < 0.05) magnitude apparent in both autumn and winter, characterized by an increase over South China and a decrease over northwestern and southwestern regions. In addition, the 'very abundant' and 'abundant' categories of available wind energy located in northern China and the low-speed wind energy in South China were projected to decrease by the middle and late of the 21st century. Although the projected decrease in annual wind power density ranged from −1.14% to −0.36% per decade among the three scenarios, we believe that, considering the strong inter-annual variability and uncertainty involved, these changes would not substantially affect China's future wind energy plans. Also of note was that a low emission scenario could to some extent mitigate the reduction in wind energy potential in the future. Furthermore, we suggest that implementation of newly developed wind power technology should consider the impact of changes in wind energy in different sub-regions (e.g., the low wind speed region over South China), which is pivotal to China's strategic planning in this sector.",

In this study, an integrated method is developed on the basis of the Low Emissions Analysis Platform (LEAP) and life cycle assessment (LCA). The energy demands and environmental co-benefits in Jinan, one of the low-carbon city pilots in China, are quantitatively evaluated under three policy scenarios: low-carbon (LC) policy scenario, pollution control (PC) policy scenario, and deep-level cut of CO2 emissions (DCC) scenario from 2016 to 2050. From 2016 to 2030, the PC policies would be more powerful than the LC policies in terms of energy demand decrease. From 2030 to 2050, the LC policies would be more efficient than all the other policies. Promoting energy-saving buildings in the LC scenario would contribute to the continual decline in energy demands. In the DCC scenario, CO2, PM2.5, PM10, CO, NOX and SO2 emissions would decline by more than 71.4% relative to the records in 2016. Global warming potential, human toxicity potential, photochemical ozone creation potential, particulate matter formation potential, and acidification potential would also decrease by 81.8%–88.5%. On the basis of the integrated city-level LEAP and LCA method, this study quantifies the various environmental impacts of urban decarbonization policies and provides science-based references for urban low-carbon transformation.",

Although the Siberian high is considered the main factor influencing cold wave events in East Asia, it was not extremely strong from 4 to November 9, 2021. The spatial distribution of the correlation coefficients between the sea level pressure and the daily temperature anomalies shows a monopole pattern, with a notable negative centre in the southern part of the Siberian high monitoring domain. However, the correlation between the sea level pressure and temperature drop presents a typical dipole pattern, with a distinct negative centre in the northern monitoring domain and a positive centre in southern East Asia. During the November 2021 super cold wave process, the sea level pressure anomalies display a dipole pattern with a higher centre in the north and a lower centre in the south owing to the northward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The meridional pressure gradient index clearly reveals the non-negligible effect of subtropical low-pressure on this super cold wave process, indicating its possibly essential supplementary role in enhancing this process. The above findings provide a new understanding of its mechanism and long-range forecasts.",

    "abstract": "Scientific studies show that fast actions to reduce near-term warming are essential to slowing self-reinforcing climate feedbacks and avoiding irreversible tipping points. Yet cutting CO2 emissions only marginally impacts near-term warming. This study identifies two of the most effective mitigation strategies to limit near-term warming beyond CO2 mitigation, namely reducing short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) and promoting targeted nature-based solutions (NbS), and comprehensively reviews the latest scientific progress in these fields. Studies show that quickly reducing SLCP emissions, particularly hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), methane, and black carbon, from all relevant sectors can avoid up to 0.6 °C of warming by 2050. Additionally, promoting targeted NbS that protect and enhance natural carbon sinks, including in forests, wetlands, grasslands, and agricultural lands, can avoid emissions of 23.8 Gt of CO2e per year in 2030, without jeopardizing food security and biodiversity. Based on the scientific evidence, we provided a series of policy recommendations on SLCPs and NbS, including: 1) implementing the Kigali Amendment to reduce HFC emissions; 2) deploying cost-effective, sector-based measures to reduce methane and black carbon emissions; and 3) implementing targeted NbS to protect and enhance existing carbon sinks and shifting away from forest-burning bioenergy. These fast-acting strategies on SLCPs and NbS will play a key role in securing the most avoided warming in the near-term and help countries meet their mid-century carbon neutrality goals. Finally, we proposed future research topics, including: improving measurement and monitoring systems and techniques for SLCP emissions; developing and improving assessments of marginal abatement costs for SLCP mitigation in different sectors; better quantifying the avoided warming potential from protecting different types of natural carbon sinks by 2030, 2050, and over longer periods; and identifying whether there are any biomass types for energy sources that are consistent with the United Nations Environment Assembly's 2022 resolution adopting a definition of NbS. Further research in these areas could help address barriers to adoption and assist countries with better integrating the most effective SLCP and NbS strategies into their climate policies.",

    "abstract": "Climate warming has been projected to enhance vegetation growth more strongly in higher latitudes than in lower latitudes, but different projections show distinct regional differences. By employing big data analysis (deep learning), we established gridded, global-scale, climate-driven vegetation growth models to project future changes in vegetation growth under SSP scenarios. We projected no substantial trends of vegetation growth change under the sustainable development scenario (SSP1-1.9) by the end of the 21st century. However, the increase of vegetation growth driven by climate warming shows distinct regional variability under the scenario representing high carbon emissions and severe warming (SSP5-8.5), especially in Northeast Asia where growth could increase by (6.00% ± 4.21%). This may be attributed to the high temperature sensitivities of the deciduous needleleaf forests and permanent wetlands in these regions. When the temperature sensitivity that is defined as permutation importance in deep learning is greater than 0.05, the increase in vegetation growth will be more prominent. In addition, an extreme temperature increase across grasslands, as well as changing land-use management in northern China may also influence the vegetation growth in the future. The results suggest that the sustainable development scenario can maintain stable vegetation growth, and it may be a reliable way to mitigate global warming due to potential climate feedbacks driven by vegetation changes in boreal regions. Deciduous needleleaf forests will be a centre of greening in the future, and it should become the focus of future vegetation dynamics modelling studies and projections.",

    "abstract": "With the Kigali Amendment (KA) coming into effect in China, the control of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) emissions has become more imperative. The mobile air-conditioning (MAC) sector is one of the important HFCs consumer sectors, and therefore studying its feasible mitigation paths and costs is of great significance to China's successful implementation of KA. This study used the bottom-up method with updated emission factors to re-evaluate the emission inventory of HFCs from the MAC sector in China from 2005 to 2020. The average annual growth rate of HFCs consumption in the MAC sector is 9.8%, and HFCs emissions have increased from 5.8 (5.3–6.2) kt in 2005 to 22.2 (20.6–23.8) kt in 2020, with an average annual growth rate of 8.8%. Using the Gompertz model combined with the Weibull function of vehicle survival rate, the ownership and new registrations of internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) and electric vehicles (EVs) in China are predicted. The ownership of ICEVs and EVs is projected to be 310 million and 91 million in 2030, respectively and 2 million and 641 million in 2060, respectively. HFCs emissions in the MAC sector would reach 59.8 (55.3–64.3) kt (80.0–93.0 Mt CO2-eq) in 2060 if without any control measure. To implement the KA, the cumulative of 1.6 Gt CO2-eq emissions would be reduced. Under the other two accelerated mitigation scenarios, the MAC sector's HFCs will reach their emissions peak in 2028 and 2025 and achieve zero emissions in 2050 and 2046, respectively. Under the accelerated mitigation with recovery scenario, the cumulative emissions are only 15.0% of the business as usual (BAU) scenario. Using HFO-1234yf as the substitute, the unit abatement cost of the MAC sector is 27.3–37.4 USD t−1 CO2-eq.",

    "abstract": "Carbon emission is inevitable, and changes with energy consumption and economic development, presents policy options toward sustainable development path. Currently, there is little assurance from policymakers in committing to climate change pledges: taking the Middle-East and North African (MENA) region as a specific case with using 2019 as a cut-off period. We conducted an interim assessment of the Paris Agreement to ascertain whether climate actions are in tandem with emissions reduction targets. Making use of difference-in-difference technique as a quasi-experiment supported by fixed-effects and placebo treatment models, the results point to evidence of less than 1% effective CO2 emissions reduction as of 2019 compared to the 2015 level. The current carbon emissions reduction commitment level is far-reaching contrary to the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) pledged (16.43% on average by 2030 compared to the 2015 level). The analysis suggests that achieving NDCs commitments are currently major burden on policymakers since the economic development is highly linked with nonrenewable energy consumption. Furthermore, a more comprehensive framework when accounting for all available renewable and clean energy projects shows reduction levels in the range of 30%–40% from 2020 to 2030. These results suggest that the Paris Agreement in MENA countries may be more effective from 2020, thus underscore the importance of capturing ongoing projects (involving renewable and clean energy technologies) into interim policy assessment. The shared implication is that greater efforts are demanded from the region and at country levels to further decrease emissions through the use of negative emissions technologies particularly in the electricity generation sector.",

Based on the reservoir inflow measurements, Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP), the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5) products, this study quantified the contributions of monsoon precipitation, antecedent snowmelts, and orographic precipitation enhancement to floods in Pakistan. We found that the Indus experienced at least four inflow uprushes, which was mainly supplied by precipitation and snowmelt; In upper Indus, abnormally high temperature continued to influence the whole summer and lead to large amounts of snowmelts which not only was a key water supply to the flood but also provided favorable soil moisture conditions for the latter precipitation. Before July, the snowmelt has higher contributions than the precipitation to the streamflow of Indus River, with contribution value of more than 60%. Moreover, the snowmelt could still supply 20%–40% water to the lower Indus in July and August; The leading driver of 2022 mega-floods over the southern Pakistan in July and August was dominated by the precipitation, where terrain disturbance induced precipitation account to approximately 33% over the southern Pakistan. The results help to understand the mechanisms of flood formation, and to better predict future flood risks over complex terrain regions.",

Therefore, the study of cost-effective mitigation pathways for HFC-23 is important for the sustainable implementation of KA in China and other HCFC-22 producing countries. This study constructed an inventory of HFC-23 by-production, emissions, and abatement for HCFC-22 plants in China from 2006 to 2020, and predicted the costs and climate benefits of HFC-23 abatement in China's compliance with the KA between 2021 and 2060. Results showed that HFC-23 emissions from HCFC-22 plants in China contributed about 60% of the growth in global atmospheric mole fraction of HFC-23 observed by Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) from 2007 to 2020. Furthermore, China's cumulative HFC-23 abatement was about 109 kt (1613 Mt CO2-eq) from 2006 to 2019, accounting for 53% of total by-production, which allowed the global atmospheric mole fraction and radiative forcing of HFC-23 in 2020 to avoid an uplift of 9.2 × 10−9 and 1.7 mW m−2, respectively, contributing to climate change mitigation. Under the baseline of the Kigali Amendment, less emission (LE), and resource utilization (RU) scenarios, the cumulative HFC-23 abatement from 2021 to 2060 would be 683 ± 29 kt (10,107 ± 431 Mt CO2-eq), 694 ± 29 kt (10,277 ± 427 Mt CO2-eq), and 702 ± 29 kt (10,385 ± 426 Mt CO2-eq), respectively. The cumulative net abatement costs for the KA, LE, and RU scenarios would be (5.0 ± 0.2) billion, (2.9 ± 0.2) billion, and (−2.7 ± 0.2) billion CNY (2021 prices), respectively. In the future, applying resource utilization technology to reduce HFC-23 emissions can achieve both climate and economic benefits.",

However, long-term and large regional-scale studies that estimate glacier mass balance in this area remain limited. In this study, we generated a KH-9 Digital Elevation Model (DEM) (covering 87.6% of the glacier area) for the 1970s from KH-9 Hexagon imagery and quantified geodetic glacier mass over the SETP from the 1970s to 2020 using KH-9 DEM, NASADEM and ICESat-2 ATL06 data. The results show that the SETP was in a state of serious mass loss (at a rate of −0.35 ± 0.03 m w.e. per year) from the 1970s to 2020, and the rate of mass loss accelerated from −0.15 ± 0.05 to −0.56 ± 0.10 m w.e. per year between the 1970s–2000 and 2000–2020. Within the SETP, the glacier mass balance revealed a remarkable spatial heterogeneity. The maximum mean glacier mass loss rate was observed in the Hengduan Shan. Nyainqentanglha exhibited the highest acceleration in the mass loss rate since the 1970s. The warming of air temperature and decreasing snowfall can partly explain the accelerated glacier mass loss in the SETP. The study provides a new long-term glacier mass balance estimation covering almost the entire SETP that suggests the acceleration in glacier mass loss observed in the SETP since the 1970s is a regional tendency, which is crucial for understanding the relationship between glaciers and climate changes.",

    "abstract": "Sea ice drift is a critical parameter for understanding the rapid changes in Arctic sea ice. Since the release of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), there has been a lack of quantitative analysis regarding CMIP6's simulation of Arctic sea ice drift. This study aims to assess the simulated Arctic sea ice drift from 1979‒2014 by fifteen CMIP6 models against recent satellite retrievals, utilizing various quantitative indices. Additionally, the influence of near-surface wind and surface ocean current on model performance is further analyzed. The CMIP6 models capture several aspects of the observed Arctic sea ice drift climatology and variability. The seasonal patterns of sea ice drift speed in all models exhibit similarities with the observed data, and the models agree with the evaluation datasets, indicating that the seasonal evolution of sea ice drift corresponds to near-surface wind patterns. However, notable discrepancies are identified. All models overestimate sea ice drift speed, exceeding the observational data by 36%‒97%. Fourteen out of fifteen models display larger seasonal variability (ranging from 0.74‒1.28 km d−1) compared to the observed data (0.54 km d−1). Seven out of fifteen models exhibit a significant increasing trend in annual sea ice drift speed, similar to the observed trend of 0.58 km d−1 per decade, but with weaker trends (ranging from 0.11‒0.33 km d−1 per decade). The remaining eight models reveal no statistically significant trend. The potential causes of such biases were further explored in this study. It suggests that the overestimation of sea ice drift speed in the models might be primarily attributed to the overestimation of near-surface wind speeds and their influence on sea ice drift speed. The models' overestimation of seasonal variability in near-surface wind speeds may account for the overestimation of seasonal variability in sea ice drift. The models' inability to represent the trend in sea ice drift speed may result from their failure to simulate an increasing trend in surface ocean current speed.",

    "abstract": "Discharge characteristics are crucial for detecting changes in hydrological processes.Recently, the river hydrology) in the Headwater Area of the Yellow River (HAYR) has exhibited erratic regimes (e.g., monotonously declining/low/high hydrograph, even with normal precipitation) under the effects of climate change, permafrost thaw and changes in dam operation.This study integrates hydroclimatic variables (air temperature, precipitation, and potential evapotranspiration) with anthropogenic dam operation and permafrost degradation impact data to systematically examine the mechanisms of these hydrological process changes during 1956e2019.The results show the following: 1) compared with the pre-dammed gauged flow, dam construction (January 1998eJanuary 2000) and removal of dam (September 2018eAugust 2019) induced monotonously low (À17.2m 3 s À1 ; À61%) and high (þ54.6m 3 s À1 ; þ138%) hydrographs, respectively; 2) hydroclimatic variables mainly controlled the summereautumn hydrological processes in the HAYR; 3) the monotonous decline of the hydrograph of Yellow River in the HAYR in some hydrological years (e.g., 1977, 1979, 1990 and 1995) was closely related with unusually high atmospheric demands of evaporation and low-intense rainfall during summereautumn seasons; and 4) the lengthening of subsurface hydrological pathways and residence time, permafrost degradation reduced the recession coefficient (À0.002 per year) of winter flow and altered the hydrological regimes of seasonal rivers, which resulted in flattened hydrographs that reduced and delayed the peak flow (of 0.05 mm per year and 1.65 d per year, respectively) as well as boosted the winter baseflow (0.01 mm per year).This study can provide updated and systematic understanding of changing hydrological processes in typical alpine catchments on northeastern QinghaieTibet Plateau, China under a warming climate.",

    "abstract": "Permafrost and its spatiotemporal variation considerably influence the surface and sub-surface hydrological processes, biogeochemical cycles, fauna and flora growth and cold region engineering projects in the Three-River Source Region (TRSR), Qinghai–Tibet Plateau. However, the dynamics of permafrost over a relatively long term duration (e.g. >100 years) in the TRSR is not well quantified. Thus, the spatial and temporal variations of the temperature at the top of the perennially frozen/unfrozen ground (TTOP), active layer thickness (ALT) in permafrost regions and the maximum depth of frost penetration (MDFP) in the seasonally frozen ground of the TRSR during 1901–2020 were simulated using the TTOP model and Stefan equation driven by the widely used reanalysis Climatic Research Unit 4.05 dataset. Results revealed that the permafrost in the TRSR over the past 120 years did not degrade monotonically but experienced considerable fluctuations in area with the decadal oscillations of climate warming and cooling: shrinking from 263.9 × 103 km2 in the 1900s to 233.3 × 103 km2 in the 1930s, expanding from 232.3 × 103 km2 in the 1940s to 260.9 × 103 km2 in the 1970s and shrinking again from 254.1 × 103 km2 in the 1980s to 228.9 × 103 km2 in the 2010s. The regional average TTOP increased from −1.34 ± 2.74 °C in the 1910s to −0.48 ± 2.69 °C in the 2010s, demonstrating the most noticeable change for the extremely stable permafrost (TTOP < −5 °C) from 8% to 1%. The regional average ALT increased from 2.68 ± 0.52 m to 2.87 ± 0.46 m, with the area proportion of ALT > 3.0 m by 12% from 1901 to 2020. Notably, minor changes were observed for the regional average MDFP, probably due to the increase in the area proportion of MDFP < 3.0 m (caused by climate warming) and MDFP > 3.5 m (owing to the transformation of permafrost to seasonally frozen ground) by 7.39% and 4.77%, respectively. These findings can facilitate an in-depth understanding of permafrost dynamics and thus provide a scientific reference for eco-environment protection and sustainable development under climate change in the TRSR.",

    "abstract": "Over the years, numerous geotechnical approaches have been implemented to mitigate the adverse effects of climate warming on various infrastructures in the permafrost region of the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP), such as the Qinghai–Tibet Highway and Railway, and achieved the expected engineering outcomes. However, little attention has been given to whether the performance of these geotechnical approaches has changed during the ongoing process of climate warming. To investigate the performance variation of one of these geotechnical approaches, which is two-phase closed thermosyphon (TPCT), during sustained climate warming, we conducted a statistical analysis of soil temperature monitoring data in 2003—2020 from eight regular embankments and six TPCT embankments in our permafrost monitoring network. The results indicate that TPCT undeniably has a cooling effect on the permafrost beneath embankments, even rapidly eliminated previously formed taliks beneath embankment. However, further analysis reveals that the performance of TPCT has been weakening during sustained climate warming, which has confirmed by the re-forming of the taliks beneath embankment where they had been previously eliminated. Based on the current understanding, we attributed the weakening of thermosyphon performance to a significant reduction in the air temperature freezing index caused by ongoing climate warming. Through this study, we aimed to draw attention to the evolving performance of geotechnical approaches in permafrost regions amid climate warming, prompting necessary engineering innovations to address this situation and ensure the sustainable development of the permafrost region on the QTP.",

    "abstract": "Flood frequency in river source regions is significantly affected by rainfall and snowmelt as part of climatic changes. A traditional univariate flood frequency analysis cannot reflect the complexity of floods, and when used in isolation, it can only underestimate flood risk. For effective flood prevention and mitigation, it is essential to consider the combined effects of precipitation and snowmelt. Copula functions can effectively quantify the joint distribution relationship between floods and their associated variables without restrictions on their distribution characteristics. This study uses copula functions to consider a multivariate probability distribution model of flood peak flow (Q) with cumulative snowmelt (CSm) and cumulative precipitation (CPr) for the Hutubi River basin located in northern Xinjiang, China. The joint frequencies of rainfall and snowmelt floods are predicted using copula models based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 data. The results show that Q has a significant positive correlation with 24-d CSm (r = 0.559, p = 0.002) and 23-d CPr (r = 0.965, p < 0.05). Flood frequency will increase in the future, and mid- (2050‒2074) and long-term (2075‒2099) floods will be more severe than those in the near-term (2025‒2049). The probability of flood occurrence is higher under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP1-2.6 scenarios than under SSP5-8.5. Precipitation during the historical period (1990–2014) led to extreme floods, and increasing future precipitation trends are found to be insignificant. Snowmelt increases with rising temperatures and occurs earlier than estimated, leading to an earlier flood period in the basin and more frequent snowmelt floods. The Q under the joint return period is larger than that during the same univariate return period. This difference indicates that neglecting the interaction between precipitation and snowmelt for floods leads to an underestimation of the flood risk (with underestimations ranging from 0.3% to 22%). The underestimations decrease with an increase in the return period. The joint risks of rainfall or snowmelt according to various flood periods should be considered for rivers with multi-source runoff recharge in flood control design. This study reveals the joint impact of precipitation and snowmelt on extreme floods under climate change in river source regions. This study also provides a scientific basis for regional flood prevention and mitigation strategies, as well as for the rational allocation of water resources.",

The effectiveness and potential negative consequences of CBAM have aroused extensive discussion. From the perspective of the economy-wide analysis, this study uses a global computable general equilibrium model to explore the rationality of CBAM from the aspects of socioeconomic impact and the effects of promoting climate mitigation. Furthermore, the potential alternative mechanism of CBAM is proposed. The results show that CBAM can reduce the EU's gross domestic product (GDP) loss; however, the GDP loss in all other regions increases. Moreover, CBAM raises household welfare losses in most regions, including the EU. Second, although CBAM can reduce the marginal abatement cost in eight regions, it comes at the cost of greater economic losses. Furthermore, the economic and household welfare cost of raising emissions reduction targets in regions like the USA and Japan is substantially higher than the impact of passively accepting the CBAM; therefore, CBAM's ability to drive ambitious emission reduction initiatives may be limited. Finally, for the potential alternative mechanism, from the perspective of reducing economic cost and household welfare losses, the EU could implement domestic tax cuts in the short-term and promote global unified carbon pricing in the long-term.",

    "abstract": "Given Nepal's vulnerability to extreme precipitation (EP), it is imperative to conduct a comprehensive analysis to comprehend the historical trends of such events. However, acquiring precise precipitation data for EP remains challenging in mountainous countries like Nepal owing to the scarcity of densely gauged networks. This limitation impedes the dissemination of knowledge pertaining to EP variability events in Nepal. The current research on this topic is deficient for two main reasons: 1) there is a lack of studies leveraging recently released high-resolution precipitation products to identify their EP detection capabilities, which further hinders the usability of those products in data-scarce regions like Nepal, and 2) most studies have focused on the characterisation of EP events in Nepal rather than their spatial and temporal variability. To address these issues, this study evaluated the EP detection capabilities of four high-resolution precipitation product datasets (PPDs) across Nepal from 1985 to 2020. These datasets include the ERA5 Land reanalysis data, satellite-based precipitation data (PERSIANN_CCS_CDR and CHIRPS_V2.0) and a merged dataset (TPHiPr). We used various statistical and categorical indices to assess their ability to capture the spatial and temporal variability of EP events. The annual EP events were characterised by 11 indices divided into frequency and intensity categories. The TPHiPr merged dataset offered a robust depiction of monthly precipitation estimates, achieving the highest critical success index, accuracy, probability of detection and a low false alarm ratio for daily precipitation detection of 0.1 mm in Nepal. Conversely, the PERSIANN_CCS_CDR dataset exhibited poor performance. Most PPDs showed increasing trends in EP indices. However, the TPHiPr dataset showcased those trends with fewer errors and stronger correlations for many frequency (R10mm, R20mm and R25mm) and intensity (RX1day, RX5day, PRCPTOT and R99p) indices. The results indicate that TPHiPr outperformed other PPDs in accurately representing the spatial distribution of EP trends in Nepal from 1985 to 2020, particularly noting an exacerbation of EP events mostly in the eastern region of Nepal throughout the study period. While TPHiPr demonstrated superior performance in detecting various EP indices across Nepal, individual products like the ERA5 Land reanalysis dataset showed enhanced performance in the western region of Nepal. Conversely, PERSIANN_CCS_CDR and CHIRPS_V2.0 performed well in the eastern region compared to other PPDs.",

    "abstract": "Wind energy development in Central Asia can help alleviate drought and fragile ecosystems. Nevertheless, current studies mainly used the global climate models (GCMs) to project wind speed and energy. The simulated biases in GCMs remain prominent, which induce a large uncertainty in the projected results. To reduce the uncertainties of projected near-surface wind speed (NSW) and better serve the wind energy development in Central Asia, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with bias-corrected GCMs was employed. Compared with the outputs of GCMs, dynamical downscaling acquired using the WRF model can better capture the high- and low-value centres of NSWS, especially those of Central Asia's mountains. Meanwhile, the simulated NSWS bias was also reduced. For future changes in wind speed and wind energy, under the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5) scenario, NSWS during 2031–2050 is projected to decrease compared with that in 1986–2005. The magnitude of NSWS reduction during 2031–2050 will reach 0.1 m s−1, and the maximum reduction is projected to occur over the central and western regions (>0.2 m s−1). Furthermore, future wind power density (WPD) can reveal nonstationarity and strong volatility, although a downward trend is expected during 2031–2050. In addition, the higher frequency of wind speeds at the turbine hub height exceeding 3.0 m s−1 can render the plain regions more suitable for wind energy development than the mountains from 2031 to 2050. This study can serve as a guide in gaining insights into future changes in wind energy across Central Asia and provide a scientific basis for decision makers in the formulation of policies for addressing climate change.",

    "abstract": "The Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP) has experienced rapid environmental changes, including climate warming and wetting, since the 1980s. These environmental changes significantly impact the shallow soil hydrothermal conditions, which have key roles in land–atmosphere feedback and ecosystem functions. However, the spatial variations and responses of soil hydrothermal conditions to environmental changes over the QTP with permafrost (PF) and seasonal frost (SF) remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the spatial variations in soil temperature (ST) and soil moisture (SM) changes over the QTP from 2000 to 2020 using 99 in-situ sites with observations at 4 depths (i.e. 10, 40, 100 and 200 cm). The main environmental controlling factors were further identified using a calibrated statistical model. Results showed that significant (p < 0.05) soil warming occurred at multiple soil layers during 2000–2020 with a wide variation (i.e. 0.033–0.039 °C per year on average), whereas the warming rates at PF sites were two times greater than those at SF sites. In addition, the soil wetting rate was high over the SF region, whereas the soil wetting rate was low over the PF region. Aside from air temperature, changes in thawing degree days and solar radiation (Srad) contributed most to soil warming in the PF region, whereas changes in rainfall, Srad and evaporation (EVA) have been identified as the key factors in the SF region. As for soil wetting, changes in snowfall, freezing degree days and vegetation have noticeable nonlinear effects over the PF region, whereas changes in EVA, Srad and rainfall highlighted distinct linear and nonlinear effects in the SF region. These findings can enhance our understanding of the hydrothermal impacts of future environmental changes over the QTP.",

    "abstract": "A climate transition towards warm–wet conditions in Northwest China has drawn much attention. With continuous climate change and universal glacier degradation, increasing water-related hazards and vulnerability have become one of the important problems facing the Tarim Basin. However, the impacts of the climate transition on streamflow abrupt change and extreme hydrological events were less discussed, especially in glacial basins. In the present study, the discharge datasets in four glacial basins of Tarim Basin from 1979 to 2018 were constructed using the GRU-GSWAT+ model first. The differences in streamflow characteristics, the shift of hydrological extreme pattern, and potential changes of the controlling factors before and after the abrupt changes were investigated. The results indicated that the abrupt change point (ACP) in streamflow occurred in 2000 in the Qarqan River Basin, 2002 in the Weigan River Basin, and 1994 in the Aksu River Basin and the Yarkant River Basin. A general decrease in streamflow before the ACP has shifted to a notable upward trend in the Qarqan River Basin and the Aksu River Basin, while minor upward fluctuations were observed in other basins. Moreover, the hydrological characteristics in extreme events vary dramatically before and after the ACPs, characterized by a pronouncing shift from drought-dominant pattern to wet events dominated pattern. The driven climate factors have been altered after the ACPs with notable spatial heterogeneity, in which temperature remained as the dominant role in meltwater-dominated basins while the influence of precipitation has increased after the ACPs, whereas the sensitivity of temperature on streamflow change has been enhanced in basins dominated by precipitation such as the Qarqan River Basin. Owing to the evident warming–wetting trend and glacier compensation effect, both the inter-annual and intra-annual streamflow fluctuations can be efficiently smoothed in basins with a high glacier area ratio (GAR). These findings provide a further understanding of the abrupt change in streamflow under the exacerbated climate and glacier change in mountainous arid regions.",

    "abstract": "Glaciers have retreated and shrunk in high-mountain Asia since the mid-20th century because of global warming, leading to glacier instability and hazardous ice‒snow avalanches. However, the complex relationship between ice‒snow avalanches and factors such as climate and potential triggers are difficult to understand because of the lack of observational data. Here, we addressed ice‒snow avalanches on the Annapurna II glacier in Nepal, Central Himalaya. We constructed an ice‒snow avalanche history using long-term multi-source remote sensing images (1988‒2021) and mapped the velocity fields of glaciers using cross-correlation analysis on SAR and optical images. Then, we investigated the impact of climate change and earthquakes on the frequency and size of ice‒snow avalanches. The results demonstrate that the frequency of ice‒snow avalanches has increased from 10 in 1988 to 27 in 2020, but the average area of ice‒snow avalanche deposits has decreased by approximately 70%, from 3.4 × 105 m2 in 1988 to 1.2 × 105 m2 in 2020. The evolutionary characteristic of ice avalanches is linked to the impact of glacier retreat (reduction in ice material supply) and increased activity under climate change. The glacier movement velocity controls the size of ice‒snow avalanches and can be set as an indicator for ice‒snow avalanche warnings. On the Annapurna II glacier, an ice–snow avalanche occurred when the glacier velocities were greater than 1.5 m d−1. These results offer insights into ice avalanche risk assessment and prediction in high-mountain areas, particularly in regions characterised by dense glacier distribution.",

The results show that the current FG areas (1991‒2020 mean) in the Northern Hemisphere (NH), Southern Hemisphere (SH), and globe are 68.50 × 106, 9.03 × 106, and 77.53 × 106 km2, which account for 72.4%, 26.8%, and 60.4% of the exposed land (excluding glaciers, ice sheets, and water bodies) in the NH, SH and the globe, respectively; further, relative to 1951‒1980, the FG area decreased by 1.9%, 8.8%, and 2.8%, respectively. Seasonally FG at lower latitudes degrades to intermittently FG, and intermittently FG degrades to non-frozen ground, which caused the global FG boundary to retreat to higher latitudes from 1950 to 2020.

The FFP prolongation in the NH is mainly influenced by LFD advance, while in the SH it is mainly controlled by FFD delay.

By integrating daily meteorological data from observations in 1961–2022 and global climate models (GCMs) based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, the evolution patterns of CHDEs were compared and examined among three sub-catchments of the Yangtze River Basin, and the return periods of CHDE in 2050s and 2100s were projected. The findings indicate that the climate during the 2022 CHDE period was the warmest and driest recorded in 1961–2022, with precipitation less than 154.5 mm and a mean daily maximum temperature 3.4 °C higher than the average of 1981–2010, whereas the characteristics in the sub-catchments exhibited temporal and spatial variation. In July–August 2022, the most notable feature of CHDE was its extremeness since 1961, with return periods of ∼ 200-year in upstream, 80-year in midstream, and 40-year in downstream, respectively. By 2050, the return periods witnessed 2022 CHDE would likely be reduced by one-third.

    "abstract": "To ensure the long-term service performance of infrastructure such as railways, highways, airports and oil pipelines built on permafrost slope wetland sites, it is imperative to systematically uncover the long-term heat‒water changes of soil in slope wetlands environment under climate warming. More specifically, considering valuable field data from 2001 to 2019, the long-term heat and water changes in active layers of the slope wetland site along the Qinghai–Xizang Railway (QXR) are illustrated, the effect of thermosyphon measures in protecting the permafrost environment is evaluated, and the influences of climate warming and hydrological effects on the stability of slope wetland embankments are systematically discussed. The permafrost at the slope wetland site is rapidly degrading, demonstrating a reduction in active layer thickness of >3.7 cm per year and a permafrost temperature warming of >0.006 °C per year. The thermosiphon embankment developed by QXR has a specific cooling period; thus, to mitigate the long-term impacts of climate warming on the thermal stability of permafrost foundation, it is essential to implement strengthening measures for the thermosiphon embankment, such as adding a crushed-rock layer or sunshade board on the slope of thermosiphon embankment to creating a composite cooling embankment. Short-term seasonal groundwater seepage intensifies frost damage to the slope wetland embankment, while long-term seasonal supra-permafrost water and groundwater seepage exacerbates uneven transverse deformation of slope wetland embankment. Long-term climate warming and slope effects have altered the surface water and groundwater hydrological processes of slope wetlands, potentially leading to an increased occurrence of slope embankment instability. These results are crucial for improving our understanding of heat and water variation processes in the active layer of slope wetland sites located in permafrost regions and ensuring long-term service safety for the QXR.",

    "abstract": "Between 1876 and 1878 a large-scale drought occurred in China. This is a major meteorological disaster and an extreme climate event despite the cold climate at the end of the Little Ice Age. In this paper the dynamic evolution of the occurrence and development of the drought is reproduced on the basis of historical literature records. These were used to calculate the yearly numbers of drought-hit counties and to determine the spatial distribution in addition with concomitant famine, locust plague and pestilence epidemic for each of the three years. The persistent drought disaster spread over 13 provinces with its center in Shaanxi, Henan and Shanxi provinces, where the continuous non-soaking rain period exceeded 340 days. Conclusively, it is more severe than the worst drought (1928–1930) in the 20th century. This drought disaster of 1876–1878 took place in the descending phase of the 11th sunspot activity period and the start of the 12th period. It also happened during a spell of frequent El Niño events and corresponds with an extremely strong El Niño. Zhang, D., and Y.

    "abstract": "In order to improve air quality, the European Union introduced the New Air Quality Directive in 2008 and set its Member States strict targets on air pollution concentrations for the most harmful and challenging substances, such as fine particles. The law enforcement relies on a monitoring and reporting system to inform the European Commission and the public, for it is the citizens’ right to be informed about harmful air quality. With sectoral measures, air quality could be improved in the past 20 years, but some emissions concentrations have stagnated in recent years and emissions temporarily exceed thresholds in nearly half of the Member States. The European Emission Inventory allows the commission to identify the substances, areas, and times of exceedances, and to implement sectoral measures leading to air quality improvements, all of which have to be made available publicly.

    "abstract": "In this study, the period that corresponds to the threshold of a 1.5 °C rise (relative to 1861–1880) in surface temperature is validated using a multi-model ensemble mean from 17 global climate models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). On this basis, the changes in permafrost and snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere are investigated under a scenario in which the global surface temperature has risen by 1.5 °C, and the uncertainties of the results are further discussed. The results show that the threshold of 1.5 °C warming will be reached in 2027, 2026, and 2023 under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5, respectively. When the global average surface temperature rises by 1.5 °C, the southern boundary of the permafrost will move 1–3.5° northward (relative to 1986–2005), particularly in the southern Central Siberian Plateau. The permafrost area will be reduced by 3.43 × 106 km2 (21.12%), 3.91 × 106 km2 (24.1%) and 4.15 × 106 km2 (25.55%) relative to 1986–2005 in RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. The snow water equivalent will decrease in over half of the regions in the Northern Hemisphere but increase only slightly in the Central Siberian Plateau. The snow water equivalent will decrease significantly (more than 40% relative to 1986–2005) in central North America, western Europe, and northwestern Russia. The permafrost area in the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau will decrease by 0.15 × 106 km2 (7.28%), 0.18 × 106 km2 (8.74%), and 0.17 × 106 km2 (8.25%), respectively, in RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5. The snow water equivalent in winter (DJF) and spring (MAM) over the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau will decrease by 14.9% and 13.8%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "This study focuses on examining the characteristics of climate factors and extreme climate events in Northeast China during 1961–2010 by using daily data from 104 stations, including surface air temperature, precipitation, wind speed, sunshine duration, and snow depth. Results show that annual mean temperature increased at a significant rate of 0.35°C per decade, most notably in the Lesser Khingan Mountains and in winter. Annual rainfall had no obvious linear trend, while rainy days had a significant decreasing trend. So, the rain intensity increased. High-temperature days had a weak increasing trend, and low-temperature days and cold wave showed significant decreasing trends with rates of –3.9 d per decade and –0.64 times per decade, respectively. Frequency and spatial scope of low-temperature hazard reduced significantly. Warm days and warm nights significantly increased at 1.0 and 2.4 d per decade, while cold days and cold nights decreased significantly at –1.8 and –4.1 d per decade, respectively. The nighttime warming rate was much higher than that for daytime, indicating that nighttime warming had a greater contribution to the overall warming trend than daytime warming. The annual mean wind speed, gale days, and sunshine duration had significant decreasing trends at rates of –0.21 m s–1 per decade, –4.0 d per decade and –43.3 h per decade, respectively. The snow cover onset dates postponed at a rate of 1.2 d per decade, and the snow cover end date advanced at 1.5 d per decade, which leads to shorter snow cover duration by –2.7 d per decade. Meanwhile, the maximum snow depth decreased at –0.52 cm per decade. In addition, the snow cover duration shows a higher correlation with precipitation than with temperature, which suggests that precipitation plays a more important role in maintaining snow cover duration than temperature.

    "abstract": "China's energy carbon emissions are projected to peak in 2030 with approximately 110% of its 2020 level under the following conditions: 1) China's gross primary energy consumption is 5 Gtce in 2020 and 6 Gtce in 2030; 2) coal's share of the energy consumption is 61% in 2020 and 55% in 2030; 3) non-fossil energy's share increases from 15% in 2020 to 20% in 2030; 4) through 2030, China's GDP grows at an average annual rate of 6%; 5) the annual energy consumption elasticity coefficient is 0.30 in average; and 6) the annual growth rate of energy consumption steadily reduces to within 1%. China's electricity generating capacity would be 1,990 GW, with 8,600 TW h of power generation output in 2020. Of that output 66% would be from coal, 5% from gas, and 29% from non-fossil energy. By 2030, electricity generating capacity would reach 3,170 GW with 11,900 TW h of power generation output. Of that output, 56% would be from coal, 6% from gas, and 37% from non-fossil energy. From 2020 to 2030, CO2 emissions from electric power would relatively fall by 0.2 Gt due to lower coal consumption, and relatively fall by nearly 0.3 Gt with the installation of more coal-fired cogeneration units. During 2020–2030, the portion of carbon emissions from electric power in China's energy consumption is projected to increase by 3.4 percentage points. Although the carbon emissions from electric power would keep increasing to 118% of the 2020 level in 2030, the electric power industry would continue to play a decisive role in achieving the goal of increase in non-fossil energy use. This study proposes countermeasures and recommendations to control carbon emissions peak, including energy system optimization, green-coal-fired electricity generation, and demand side management.",

With this so-called consumer responsibility method, the emissions embodied in imported electricity are calculated with source-specific emission factors. Using the new method, we estimate CO2 emissions in 2005 and 2010. Compared with those derived from the producer responsibility method, the power exporters’ emissions decreased sharply. The emissions from the power sector in Inner Mongolia, the largest power exporter of China, decreased by 109 Mt in 2010. The value is equivalent to those from Shaanxi’s power production and Canada’s power and heat production. In contrast, the importers’ emissions increased substantially. The emissions from the power sector in Hebei, the largest power importer of China, increased by 74 Mt. Emissions of Beijing, increased by 60 Mt (320%), in 2010. Thus, we suggest that the Chinese government should take the emissions, as calculated from the consumption perspective, into account when formulating and assessing local CO2 emission reduction targets.

With the change in snow cover resulting from climate change that causes concerns about its consequences, there is a pressing need to analyze and understand its impact on the benefits that people has been enjoying from snow cover. These can be derived from the variation in economic value of snow services, that are demanded to meet socioeconomic activities. Based on the average decline mass of snow cover from 1979 to 2016 in Irtysh River Basin, we use the approach by applying economic evaluation to estimate the annual value loss of snow services. Considering the decreasing trend of snow cover mass at rates of −10.2 Mt per year (p < 0.05) or 0.3% per year, the annual service loss in Irtysh River Basin is currently worth up to CN¥196 million. Within it, the service loss of climate regulation contributes the most, or about CN¥84.7 million. The loss of freshwater service contributes only about 19%, implying that there would be a significant underestimation of service loss if only water supply would be considered. This may cause biased decision-making when we are facing the challenges of declining services as a result of climate change, impacting on the balancing of socioeconomic development and environment conservation for the sustainability over a long term.",

The main aim of the article is to evaluate the role of cultural differences for their explanation. We expect no significant differences in the attitudes related to the findings of climate research, since scientific principles are the joint basis of the scientific discourse wordwide. However, we expect that there are differences in the attitudes of the young scholars about the role of science, of the state and of the civil society for dealing with the challenge of climate change. We suggest that these can be explained with substantial cultural differences between both societies, with regard to the role of the state and the civil society for the solution of environmental problems. In order to evaluate these hypotheses, we have conducted a comparative survey among environmental science students in Qingdao (China) and Hamburg (Germany) about their attitudes towards climate change. The findings support our main hypotheses. The young scholars in Qingdao and Hamburg differ substantially in their views of the role of science in society and policymaking. Plausibly, these differences may mainly be explained with differences in the cultural ideas about the role of the state and of the civil society for the solution of environmental problems. Gradual differences in the share of young scholars who think that climate change has anthropogenic causes, may be explained with differences in the curriculum but also by cultural habits. This article makes a new contribution to the scientific debate by exploring the role of cultural differences for differences in the attitudes of young scholars in environmental science in connection with climate change and climate policy in different cultural contexts.",

Then, an allowable bearing capacity model was used to discuss the allowable bearing capacity change on the QTP. Results show that the MAGT increased by 0.36 °C during 1950–2005. The MAGT will increase by 0.40 (RCP2.6), 0.79 (RCP4.5), 1.07 (RCP6.0), and 1.75 (RCP8.5) °C during 2006–2099. In addition, the permafrost area has decreased by 0.195 × 106 km2 in 1950–2005. The permafrost area will decrease by 0.232 × 106 (RCP2.6), 0.468 × 106 (RCP4.5), 0.564 × 106 (RCP6.0), and 0.803 × 106 (RCP8.5) km2 during 2006–2099.

    "abstract": "The shear behavior of the frozen soil−structure interface is important for accurately predicting the interface responses of structures adopted in the cold regions. The purpose of this study is to experimentally and theoretically investigate the shear behavior of frozen clay–concrete interface under engineering conditions. A large-scale direct shear apparatus with a temperature-controlled shear box is used to test the interface behavior. Test specimens consisting of a cement concrete block and frozen soil with initial water content ranging between 14.6% and 24.6% were prepared at different conditions of temperatures (15.4 to −9.8 °C), shear rates (0.03–0.9 mm min−1), and normal stresses (50–200 kPa). It is found that the peak shear strength is linear developing with increasing of normal stress, initial water content, and temperature. It increased from 67.7 to 133.3 kPa as the initial water content increased from 14.9% to 24.6% at temperature of −6.8 to −6.6 °C, and it increased from 51.2 to 80.6 kPa with temperature decreasing from 15.4 to −9.8 °C at initial water content of 14.6%–14.9%, furthermore it has a power law relationship with shear rate. The final vertical displacement increases with the decreasing temperature, and increasing initial water content. While, it is slight or could be ignored at lower shear rates (e.g. 0.03 mm min−1 and 0.15 mm min−1) and it is −0.25 mm and −0.28 mm at shear rate of 0.3 mm min−1 and 0.9 mm min−1, respectively. In addition, the evolution of vertical displacement also varies with test condition, the growth rate at beginning increases with increasing initial water content and decreasing temperature or ice content, which is because of the ice film effects the particle size. Moreover, a disturbed state concept model combined with linear and nonlinear characteristics is developed to describe the interface shear behavior. The disturbance D reflects the interface mechanical response and responds differently trend for different test conditions, increasing faster with increasing temperature and decreasing initial water content or shear rate. The testing results, including the test and model results, can be used to simulate the performance of engineered geotechnical assets such as earth dams or irrigation channels with concrete linings in cold regions.",

GHG (CO2, CH4, and N2O) inventories for Pakistan have been developed by conducting a detailed sectoral assessment of IPCC source sectors, energy, industrial processes and product use (IPPU), agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU), and the waste sector. Further, sector wise comparative analysis of GHG inventories (1994–2017) based on the 2006 and 1996 IPCC Guidelines have also been presented. Results indicated an average relative difference of 4% in total GHG emissions (CO2 equivalent) from energy sector between 2006 and 1996 IPCC Guidelines. With 3.6% average annual growth rate based on 2006 IPCC Guidelines, CO2 from energy sector remained the most abundant GHG emitted, followed by CH4 and N2O. While the average absolute difference in emissions of CH4 and N2O from the energy sector is notable, the total estimated GHG emissions by 2006 IPCC Guidelines duplicate those by 1996 IPCC Guidelines. In the mineral industry with 2006 IPCC Guidelines, an average annual growth rate of 6.7% is observed, contributing 64% of total IPPU sector CO2 emissions. Nevertheless, the relative difference between the two Guidelines in overall IPPU sector emissions remained negligible. There might be a need for switching to 2006 IPCC Guidelines to consider more parameters such as additional source sectors and new default emission factors that fit into national circumstances.",

Sea level rise due to climate change increases the occurrence of coastal flood events, creating more challenges to coastal societies. Here we intend to draw the understanding of coastal inundation from our early studies, and provide a silhouette of our approaches in assessing climate change impacts as well as developing risk-based climate adaptation. As a result, we impart a distinctive view of the adaption towards the integration of asset design, coastal planning and policy development, which reflect multiscale approaches crossing individual systems to regions and then nation. Having the approaches, we also discussed the constraints that would be faced in adaptation implementation. In this regard, we initially follow the risk approach by illustrating hazards, exposure and vulnerability in relation to coastal inundation, and manifest the impact and risk assessment by considering an urban environment pertinent to built, natural, and socioeconomic systems. We then extend the scope and recommend the general approaches in developing adaptation to coastal inundation under climate change towards ameliorating overall risks, practically, by the reduction in exposure and vulnerability in virtue of the integration of design, planning and polices. In more details, a resilience design is introduced, to effectively enhance the capacity of built assets to resist coastal inundation impact. We then emphasize on the cost-effective adaptation for coastal planning, which delineates the problem of under-adaptation that leaves some potential benefits unrealized or over-adaptation that potentially consumes an excessive amount of resources. Finally, we specifically explore the issues in planning and policies in mitigating climate change risks, and put forward some emerging constraints in adaptation implementation. It suggests further requirements of harmonizing while transforming national policies into the contents aligned with provincial and local governments, communities, and households.",

    "abstract": "The Paris Agreement aims to keep global warming to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 °C, recognizing this will reduce the risks of natural disasters significantly. As changes in the risks of temperature extremes are often associated with changes in the temperature probability distribution, further analysis is still needed to improve understanding of the warm extremes over China. In this study, changes in the occurrence probability of temperature extremes and statistic characteristics of the temperature distribution are investigated using the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) multimodel simulations from 1861 to 2100. The risks of the once-in-100-year TXx and TNx events are projected to increase by 14.4 and 31.4 times at 1.5 °C warming. Even, the corresponding risks under 2 °C global warming are 23.3 and 50.6, implying that the once-in-100-year TXx and TNx events are expected to occur about every 5 and 2 years over China, respectively. The Tibetan Plateau, Northwest China and south of the Yangtze River are in greater risks suffering hot extremes (both day and night extremes). Changes in the occurrence probability of warm extremes are generally well explained by the combination of the shifts in location and scale parameters in areas with grown variability, i.e., the Tibetan Plateau for TXx, south of the Yangtze River for both TXx and TNx. The location (scale) parameter leading the risks of once-in-20-year TXx to increase by more than 5 (0.25) and 3 (0.75) times under 2 °C warming in the Tibetan Plateau and south of the Yangtze River, respectively. The location parameter is more important for regions with decreased variability e.g., the Tibetan Plateau for TNx, Northwest China for both TXx and TNx, with risks increase by more than 3, 6 and 4 times due to changes in location.",

    "abstract": "Arctic warming leads to permafrost degradation, which can increase ecosystem respiration and release more greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. Meanwhile, climate warming also promotes the plant growth and increases carbon assimilation. Presently, it is largely unknown about the carbon budget and their responses to climate change in the Arctic regions. In this study, to investigate the seasonal and annual net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE), we collected 71 observation stations for net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 in the high latitude permafrost regions during 2002–2017. The results showed that the annual NEE was −8.2 ± 4.1 g CO2 m−2 d−1 for forest, −3.3 ± 2.6 g CO2 m−2 d−1 for shrub, −4.8 ± 4.1 g CO2 m−2 d−1 for grassland, −3.6 ± 3.0 g CO2 m−2 d−1 for wetland and 0.02 ± 0.62 g CO2 m−2 d−1 for tundra, respectively. From 2002 to 2017, the CO2 emissions of grassland (carbon source) showed a decreasing trend, and the CO2 assimilation of shrub and forest (carbon sink) has been increased. The wetland and tundra are shifting from carbon sources to sinks. There were great variations in temperature sensitivities (Q10) of NEE in different seasons, with larger values in winter and lower values in summer. These findings indicate that the Arctic terrestrial ecosystem presently acts as a carbon sink, while there is a possibility that future warming, especially the warming in winter, may decrease the carbon sink of the Arctic terrestrial ecosystem.",

Based on ground temperature and deformation data of the embankment at location K1497 + 150 of the QTR in 2006–2018, the thermal regime and deformation process were analysed. The results showed that 1) the degradation rate of permafrost under the embankment was faster than that under the natural site without engineering construction, and 2) the deformation rate of the embankment had exceeded the safety range for the QTR embankment before adopting mitigative measures. In addition, this study evaluated the cooling effect on the underlying permafrost and working mechanism of two strengthening measures. Two measures, crushed rock revetment (CRR) and thermosyphons, were adopted to protect the underlying permafrost from continual degradation. The individual cooling effect of the CRR was not as good as that of the thermosyphons. However, the combination of the two could enhance the protective effects of each on the underlying permafrost, effectively cooling the permafrost and improving the stability of the embankment.",

    "abstract": "With global warming, glaciers in the high mountains of China are retreating rapidly. However, few data have been reported on whether greenhouse gases from these glaciers are released into the atmosphere or absorbed by glacial meltwater. In this study, we collected meltwater and ice samples from Laohugou Glacier No. 12 in western China and measured CH4 and CO2 concentrations. Meltwater from the glacier terminus was continually sampled between 3 and 5 August 2020 to measure CH4 and CO2 concentrations. The results demonstrated that meltwater is a source of CH4 because the average saturations are over 100%. It could be concluded that CH4 in the atmosphere can be released by glacial meltwater. However, the CO2 saturations are various, and CO2 fluxes exhibit positive (released CO2) or negative (absorbed CO2) values because the water and atmospheric conditions are variable. More importantly, the CH4 and CO2 concentrations were higher in meltwater samples from the glacier terminus than in samples from the surface ice (including an ice core) and a surface stream. Although the meltwater effect from the upper part of the glacier cannot be excluded, we speculated that subglacial drainage systems with an anaerobic environment may represent the CH4 source, but it needs to be further investigated in the future. However, high mountain glaciers are currently ignored in global carbon budgets, and the increased melting of glaciers with global warming may accelerate the absorption of much more CO2 and lead to the release of CH4.",

    "abstract": "Compared with short-duration events, long-lasting regional extreme low-temperature events (RELTEs) often have more severe impacts on human societies due to the induced persistence and large geographic area of related weather and climate disaster. Accordingly, an improved objective technique was applied to identify all long-lasting RELTEs in Eurasia from the winter of 1948/1949 to 2017/2018, followed by an in-depth discussion of its variation in terms of the annual frequency, duration, impacted area, mean intensity, maximum intensity, and a comprehensive index. The RELTE lasting for 52 d in the winter of 2007/2008 exhibited the longest duration, largest impacted area, and a greatest comprehensive index, which induced extremely low temperatures for more than 20 d in Western Asia, Central Asia, and China. During the past 70 winters, the frequency of long-lasting RELTEs decreased, especially after the late 1960s. Nevertheless, the mean and maximum intensities and comprehensive index exhibited distinctly increasing trends. All indicators of winter long-lasting RELTEs had a similar inter-decadal fluctuation featured by two noticeable peaks occurring around 1970 and 2007, and a remarkable recovery was discovered in the period of late 1990s to mid-2010s, especially for the occurrence of super long-lasting events. Significantly, winter long-lasting RELTEs in Eurasia showed distinct trends under various decadal climate backgrounds, i.e., a strong negative or weak positive trend in the accelerated warming period and conversely, a strong positive or weak negative trend in the warming slowdown stage. These findings indicate that we should be alert of the similar future recovery of winter long-lasting RELTEs in Eurasia, which are likely to occur in the slowdown period of global warming.",

    "abstract": "Climate change with increasing temperature is making a significant impact on human health, including more heat-related diseases, and increasing the burden on the healthcare system. Although many studies have explored the association between increasing temperatures and negative health outcomes, research on the associated costs of heat-related diseases remains relatively sparse. Furthermore, estimations of future costs associated with heat-attributable hospital healthcare have not been well explored. This study used a distributed lag nonlinear model to estimate heat-attributable hospital healthcare costs in Perth, Western Australia. Using 2006–2012 as the baseline, future costings for 2026–2032 and 2046–2052 were estimated under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5. Higher temperatures were found to be associated with increased hospital healthcare costs. The total hospital costs attributable to heat over the baseline period 2006–2012 was estimated to be 79.5 million AUD, with costs for mental health hospitalizations being the largest contributor of the heat-related conditions examined. Costs are estimated to increase substantially to 125.8–129.1 million AUD in 2026–2032, and 174.1–190.3 million AUD by midcentury under climate change scenarios. Our findings of a notable burden of heat-attributable healthcare costs now and in the future emphasize the importance of climate change adaptation measures to reduce the adverse health effects of increasing temperatures and heat exposure on the people of Perth.",

The spread of snails not only depends on the degree of warming but also on the socioeconomic development of the next few decades. Shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) published by CMIP6 consider carbon emission pathways as well as influences of distinct types of social development and land use on the regional climate, providing the possibility to accurately evaluate the impact of socioeconomic development and climate variation on the spread of O. hupensis. This study employed SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585 and the correlative approach to explore the impacts of climate change and socioeconomic development on the potential diffusion areas for O. hupensis in China. The results exhibited strong evidence that O. hupensis will spread in the north of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and disappear from a small part of its current southern habitat, whereas in Sichuan and Yunnan, O. hupensis may spread slightly to the southeast. The projection also demonstrated that fossil fuel-driven development (SSP585) will be more conducive to the spread of O. hupensis breeding sites in the 2030s, whereas the continuous increase in snail breeding habitats under the regional rivalry path (SSP370) may lead to great challenges in snail control in the long term (2020–2080).",

The comprehensive hazard and the overall situation of ELTEs in the whole of 2021 are still unclear. Accordingly, the overview of ELTEs over the mainland in 2021 and their hazards were systematically reviewed and comprehensively evaluated by using an improved identification and assessment method, which can objectively determine the hazard levels of ELTEs and distinguish spatial differences in the hazard of a single event. A total of 20 ELTEs occurred in 2021; their intensity was remarkably higher than the climatology, while the impacted area and duration were lower than or near the climatology, indicating a normal hazard. In general, the losses of low-temperature related disasters in 2021 were relatively less than the average loss in the past ten years, which is likely related to the low proportion of higher-than-moderately low events in the whole year. ELTEs in 2021 had large impacts on Northwest, North and Northeast China and small impacts on the southeastern Qinghai–Tibet Plateau and western parts of Southwest China. Winter and autumn had a higher-than-normal hazard index for ELTEs due to two high-hazard events in early-to-mid January and early-to-mid November, respectively. These two high-hazard events showed different spatial impacts. The former mainly affected central and eastern parts of China. However, the latter mostly attacked central and western parts of China, especially resulting in high-hazard in parts of Xinjiang.",

    "abstract": "During 6–10 January 2021, a recorded strong cold surge took place in China, with over 800 observational stations reaching their historical extremes. Unlike previous studies that focused on the response of either the power load or generation separately, this study quantitatively revealed the impacts on the balance between the demand and supply sides of the grid. On the demand side, the sensitivity of power load was found to increase substantially higher in southern China (0.533 GW °C−1) than in the northern region (0.139 GW °C−1) due to the limited municipal heating system. On the supply side, the hourly wind power generation dropped from the highest of 110 GW on 6 January to the lowest of 54 GW on 9 January due to the reduction in wind speed. In addition, a reduction in solar power generation was observed during 8–10 January. Thus, the balance of the power system was influenced by this cold event. As an effective adaptation measure, results further showed that early warning by three weeks ahead can be obtained by an operational climate model. The sensitivity of China's power system to such cold surge events may increase remarkably due to the expected increase in the proportion of wind and solar power generation in future new-type power systems. Thus, close cooperation between climate scientists and power engineers is needed to build the resilience of the power system to the cold extremes.",

    "abstract": "Frequent heavy precipitation and severe flood disasters struck northern China in early autumn 2021, with seven provinces/municipalities surpassing their precipitation records since 1961. Causes for such extreme events from the climate perspective are unclear because the variability of autumn precipitation in northern China is poorly understood. This study revealed that the event was directly caused by the extremely north-westward location of the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH), which was jointly induced by several tropical and mid-latitude factors. The developing La Niña and warmer than normal tropical Atlantic sea surface temperature altered the Pacific Walker Circulation and enhanced the convection over the tropical western Pacific. Meanwhile, the Madden–Julian Oscillation stagnated for a long time in its phases 3–5 in early autumn and contributed constructively to the active convection over the tropical eastern Indian Ocean and western Pacific. These effects altogether excited a lower-tropospheric cyclone anomaly to the west of the Philippines and shifted the WPSH northwestwards in early autumn. A mid-latitude cyclonic centre was also observed upstream of East Asia. It dispersed Rossby wave energy southeastwards in the form of cold air invasions. The resultant convergence of cold and dry air from the north with warm and moist air from the south together caused extreme precipitation over northern China in autumn 2021. Relevant conclusions can enhance our current understanding of the causes of autumn extreme precipitation events in northern China and improve our ability to predict such events and prevent resultant disasters.",

During this event, the SXJ is situated upstream of the 500 hPa trough line and close to the 200 hPa upper jet stream entrance, favouring the upper (lower) level divergence (convergence) with intensified ascending motions and prominent moisture convergence. We examined the moisture paths and sources for this significant rainfall event using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLT) model. The findings indicate that the majority of the moisture sources are located in areas west of the SXJ, extending from central Asia to the North Atlantic, whereas only a small number of trajectories originate from areas south or east of the SXJ. Seven relevant moisture sources for the rainfall event have been divided. About 80.0% of the total moisture is contributed by central Asia, which ranks top in terms of moisture contribution (∼33.2%), north Eurasia (∼25.7%), and water areas (∼17.7%), including the Mediterranean, Black and Caspian Sea region, while fractional moisture contributions among the other four regions are all below 8.0%. When compared to other parts of China (such as South China and East China), where southerly and/or easterly trajectories are the predominant moisture channels, the distribution patterns of moisture trajectories during this event are noticeably different.",

However, no consistent knowledge has been presented about whether warming and wetting trends are evenly distributed throughout ACA or whether there are noticeable topographical differences. We combined the ERA5-Land reanalysis dataset and data from Google Earth Engine to analyze the topographic differences of ACA from 1981 to 2020. The findings indicate that significant (p < 0.05) warming has a broader geographic scale in ACA and that warming rate of low-elevation landforms (high plains and hills) is higher than that of high-elevation landforms (mountains and tablelands). However, the wetting trend does not follow this pattern. By contrast, high-elevation landforms have a higher wetting rate than low-elevation landforms and are the main areas of wetting. Additionally, low-elevation landforms continue to maintain the warming and drying trends. Notably, the wetting trend of high-elevation landforms is amplified with altitude. Meanwhile, the wetting trend is negatively related to the warming trend (p < 0.01) across the entire elevation range. Collectively, the findings provide new insights into the current research hotspot of 'warming–wetting' trend in ACA and highlight the differences in the responses of different landforms to climate change.",

Improving the accuracy of ERLTC forecasts is therefore crucial in disaster prevention and mitigation. The top 26 ERLTC events in China during 1960–2020 are investigated based on multi-source datasets. These ERLTC events are categorized into five main types according to the geographical location of the extreme precipitation and its position relative to the tropical cyclone (TC) center, namely: the typhoon inner-core rainfall in Taiwan (TWIC), typhoon inverted trough rainfall in Taiwan (TWIT), weak typhoon rainfall in Hainan (HNWK), strong typhoon rainfall in Zhejiang (ZJST) and inland typhoon remnant rainfall (ILRM). All the ERLTC events occurred in the weakening stage of TC after reaching its lifetime maximum intensity in convective cloud (TBB ≤ −32 °C) regions over complex local terrain. The translational speeds of 20 TCs (76.9% of the total) were smaller than the climatological average (20.6 km h−1) during the extreme precipitation events. The differences are as follows: the TWIC and TWIT types are featured with different season, track and water vapor channel although both occurred in Taiwan. The other three types are distinguished by spinning track and strong convective cloud for HNWK type, strong TC intensity and binary TC interactions for ZJST type; and stagnation and strong westerly trough activity for ILRM type, respectively. These results are expected to provide useful clues for an in-depth understanding of ERLTC events over China.",

One challenge that has not been fully explored is the impact on coal employment. There are millions of people employed in various sectors along the coal supply chain, including mining, processing, transport, and power generation. In this study, we developed a framework to understand the magnitude and characteristics of the employment challenges associated with the coal transition across provinces. Specifically, the magnitude and characteristics of the challenges are evaluated from multiple dimensions, including existing coal sector employment, coal production, coal consumption, GDP contribution from the coal industry, and coal mining productivity, to explore how the transition of the coal industry will likely affect different provinces. The results showed that provinces with large total coal employment today are often those with high coal production and consumption, high GDP contribution from the coal industry, and low productivity of coal mining. We found that employment impacts of a coal transition will not be equally distributed in China, as both the magnitude and characteristics of the employment challenges vary substantially across all provinces.

The power transition will have an impact on the economy and employment through the value chain. Quantifying the impact is important for China's future energy and welfare policies. This study adopts input‒output model to analyze the impact on economy and employment based on accelerated and slow power transition scenarios. The results show that the low-carbon power transition will have a negative impact on coal power and coal mining and washing sectors, while a positive impact on machine manufacturing and equipment sector. Low-carbon power transition will have a positive economic and employment effect to promote inclusive growth. By 2060, economic output will increase by about 8.50 trillion CNY, value-added by about 3.39 trillion CNY, and employment will increase by about 3.74 million. Although slower coal power transition can stabilize the economic and employment effect in the short and medium run, accelerating the power transition will produce more positive effect and lower job losses by coal power in the long run. By 2060, accelerating transition will boost output by 8.21%, value-added by 8.20% and jobs by 7.97%. Accordingly, the government should establish an all-round just low-carbon transition mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale ocean‒atmosphere circulations (LOACs) have a pronounced effect on the near-surface wind speed (NSWS). In this study, we discussed the contributions of zonal and meridional flows to NSWS changes and identify the possible association between the Northern Hemisphere Annular Mode (NAM) and the NSWS changes over eastern China from 1979 to 2017. Results show that the reduction in NSWS over eastern China was mainly dominated by the weakening of the zonal wind component. NAM has a considerable effect on the NSWS over eastern China. When the NAM exhibits positive phases, the zonal-mean westerly weakens at low-to-mid-latitudes (10°–40°N). Meanwhile, descending flows prevail near 40°N, and ascending flows persist near 65°N in the troposphere. In the lower troposphere, there are northerly anomalies at low-to-mid-latitudes and southerly anomalies at mid-to-high latitudes (40°–70°N). The anomalous meridional flows transport heat from low to high latitudes and weaken the north‒south air temperature gradient. The decreased air temperature gradient over East Asia reduces the pressure gradient near the surface, decreasing NSWS in eastern China. NAM variations could dominate (32.0 ± 15.8)% of the changes in the annual mean NSWS. Nevertheless, the contribution of NAM to the interannual changes of the zonal component in NSWS could reach (45.0 ± 12.9)%.",

In addition, our regional assimilation inversion system, CCMVS-R (China Carbon Monitoring, Verification and Supporting for Regional), needs a global carbon inversion model with higher assimilation efficiency to provide boundary conditions. Here, an inversion model based on the global atmospheric chemistry model GEOS-Chem and a more accurate and easier-to-implement ensemble square root Kalman filter (EnSRF) algorithm is constructed and used to infer global and China's carbon fluxes in 2019. Atmospheric CO2 concentrations from ObsPack sites and five additional CO2 observational sites from China's Greenhouse Gas Observation Network (CGHGNET) were used for data assimilation to improve the estimate. The inverted annual global terrestrial and oceanic carbon uptake is 2.12 and 2.53 Pg C per year, respectively, accounting for 21.1% and 25.1% of global fossil fuel CO2 emissions. The remaining 5.41 Pg C per year in the atmosphere is consistent with the global atmospheric CO2 growth rates of 5.44 Pg C per year reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), showing that the inversion model can provide a reasonable estimate of global-scale natural carbon sinks. The inverted terrestrial carbon sink of China is 0.37 Pg C per year, accounting for approximately 13% of China's fossil CO2 emissions.",

    "abstract": "In Pakistan, five continuous extreme precipitation events in the summer (July‒August) of 2022 caused disastrous floods, depriving thousands of people's lives and ruining millions of hometowns. This tremendous disaster in Pakistan also happened in 2010 but with three concentrated extreme precipitation events in the middle of summer. The amount of Pakistan heavy daily precipitation in 2022 surpasses that in 2010 record, making it the strongest precipitation event ever recorded. To comprehensively understand the causes of extreme precipitation in Pakistan, this study investigated the anomalies in atmospheric circulation and moisture contribution of 2010/2022 extreme precipitation and compared their differences. The results show that an atmospheric blocking over northern Europe in both 2022 and 2010 enhanced convection in Pakistan by transporting cold‒dry air from the high-latitude region and benefiting warm‒wet monsoonal air marching to Pakistan. By employing a moisture track model, the main moisture sources for summer precipitation in Pakistan were identified. It is found that moisture contributions except from Eurasia were enhanced, causing extreme precipitation. In particular, enhanced moisture contribution from the southern Indian Ocean and the northern Indian continent in 2022 are more prominent than that in 2010. The increased moisture contribution in 2010 was due to increased evaporation induced by warming sea surface in the Indian Ocean, while much richer moisture transport in 2022 was attributed to the enhanced cross‒equatorial flow induced by the anomalous subtropical high in the Southern Hemisphere. Therefore, attention should be paid to the role of subtropical high in the Southern Hemisphere in addition to those in Northern Hemisphere in understanding disastrous extreme precipitation events in Pakistan.",

This study delves into the changes in extreme precipitation across the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and its five subregions, thereby deepening our understanding of climate impacts in the region. Employing NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Climate Projections (NEX-GDDP-CMIP6), which are bias-corrected and statistically downscaled, in conjunction with three gauge-based datasets (CN05.1, CMFD, GMFD) spanning from 1979 to 2014, this study conducts an extensive analysis using eight extreme precipitation indices in the TP. The findings reveal significant spatial disparities in extreme precipitation, with the southern subregion experiencing a significant increase while the two northern subregions show statistically insignificant changes. NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 performs best in the eastern subregion but fails to capture extreme precipitation characteristics in the southern and western subregions. Averaging over the whole period of 1979–2014 (climatology), the NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 dataset performs better on the intensity and persistence indices than on the absolute and relative threshold indices. NEX-GDDP-CMIP6's performance on climate trends is significantly below that of climatology. The NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 dataset has limitations over the TP because of its reliance on the underperforming GMFD reference data. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the variability of extreme precipitation and disparities among different subregions of the TP, laying a robust scientific groundwork for climate impact studies and future projection in this region.",

The EU is a multi-state grouping of economically developed democratic countries, while China is a unitary sovereign state and a developing economy with a strong government bureaucracy. Our hypothesis is that given their diverse political systems, the EU and China would develop different kinds of systems for the governance of adaptation to climate change. We test this hypothesis through a comparative analysis of policy documents from the two study areas, in which we examine framework policies, programmatic actions and specific actions that have been adopted to date in order to address climate change, with a specific focus on the water sector. We find that climate change adaptation began to be addressed through formal policy on a similar timeline in the two regions. The EU and China are also similar in that they use framework laws and existing sectoral policy, such as for the water sector. We find that the EU has primarily relied on integration of climate change adaptation concerns through legal instruments which set a framework for implementation of adaptation policy. In China, specific actions to be incorporated in socio-economic development plans under the existing legislation on adaptation have been the main mode for integrating adaptation into sectoral actions, though the future trend may be to develop more regulations.

    "abstract": "The controversy between the IPCC and Non-governmental IPCC (NIPCC) on the attribution of global warming are reviewed. IPCC holds that today’s global warming is mainly due to anthropogenic activities rather than natural variability, which is emphasized by NIPCC. The surface temperature observations since the mid-20th century support the hypothesis of anthropogenic impact, but for the last one hundred years or so, natural forcings such as solar activity, volcanic eruptions and thermohaline circulation variations also have had great influences on the Earth’s climate, especially on inter-decadal timescales. In addition, evidence suggests that the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and Little Ice Age (LIA) are closely associated with the solar activity over the past 1 thousand years. Over the past 10 thousand years, the North Atlantic cold events and solar activity are closely correlated. Nevertheless, the physical mechanisms of the solar-climate variability and interrelation are not well understood, yet. Notably, a prevailing view recently indicates that galactic cosmic rays may result in climatic cooling through modulating global low cloud cover.

Results showed that the El Niño (La Niña) events can induce the shrinking (expansion) of Hadley circulation extent in the Southern Hemisphere. For the Northern Hemisphere, El Niño (La Niña) mainly leads to shrinking (expansion) of the Hadley circulation extent in the middle and lower troposphere and expansion (shrinking) of the Hadley circulation extent in the upper troposphere. The ENSO associated meridional temperature gradients have close relationship with the Hadley circulation extents in both Hemispheres. But in the Northern Hemisphere, the ENSO associated eddy momentum flux divergence plays more important role in affecting the Hadley circulation extent than the meridional temperature gradient because of the small local Rossby number. In the Southern Hemisphere, as the ENSO induced eddy momentum flux divergence is small, the meridional temperature gradient dominates the change of the Hadley circulation extent.",

Both India and China are making efforts in technology and innovation domains to set foot on a trajectory of low carbon development with varying degrees of success. In finance, both China and India have experimented with various instruments—the key difference is that China has taken the support of regulation more while India has leaned on to market based instruments.

    "abstract": "Climate change resulted in changes in crop growth duration and planting structure, northward movement of planting region, and more severe plant diseases and insect pests in Northwest China. It caused earlier seeding for spring crop, later seeding for autumn crop, accelerated crop growth, and reduced mortality for winter crop. To adapt to climate change, measures such as optimization of agricultural arrangement, adjustment of planting structure, expansion of thermophilic crops, and development of water-saving agriculture have been taken. Damaging consequences of imbalance between grassland and livestock were enhanced. The deterioration trend of grassland was intensified; both grass quantity and quality declined. With overgrazing, proportions of inferior grass, weeds and poisonous weeds increased in plateau pastoral areas. Returning farmland to grazing, returning grazing to grassland, fence enclosure and artificial grassland construction have been implemented to restore the grassland vegetation, to increase the grassland coverage, to reasonably control the livestock carrying capacity, to prevent overgrazing, to keep balance between grassland and livestock, and to develop the ecological animal husbandry. In Northwest China, because the amount of regional water resources had an overall decreasing trend, there was a continuous expansion in the regional land desertification, and soil erosion was very serious. A series of measures, such as development of artificial precipitation (snow), water resources control, regional water diversion, water storage project and so on, were used effectively to respond to water deficit. It had played a certain role in controlling soil erosion by natural forest protection and returning farmland to forest and grassland. In the early 21st century, noticeable achievements had been made in prevention and control of desertification in Northwest China. The regional ecological environment has been improved obviously, and the desertification trend has shown sign of under control. Zhao, H.-Y., J.-Q. Guo, C.-J.

    "abstract": "Geoengineering (also called climate engineering), which refers to large-scale intervention in the Earth's climate system to counteract greenhouse gas-induced warming, has been one of the most rapidly growing areas of climate research as a potential option for tackling global warming. Here, we provide an overview of the scientific background and research progress of proposed geoengineering schemes. Geoengineering can be broadly divided into two categories: solar geoengineering (also called solar radiation management, or SRM), which aims to reflect more sunlight to space, and carbon dioxide removal (CDR), which aims to reduce the CO2 content in the atmosphere. First, we review different proposed geoengineering methods involved in the solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal schemes. Then, we discuss the fundamental science underlying the climate response to the carbon dioxide removal and solar radiation management schemes. We focus on two basic issues: 1) climate response to the reduction in solar irradiance and 2) climate response to the reduction in atmospheric CO2. Next, we introduce an ongoing geoengineering research project in China that is supported by National Key Basic Research Program. This research project, being the first coordinated geoengineering research program in China, will systematically investigate the physical mechanisms, climate impacts, and risk and governance of a few targeted geoengineering schemes. It is expected that this research program will help us gain a deep understanding of the physical science underlying geoengineering schemes and the impacts of geoengineering on global climate, in particular, on the Asia monsoon region.",

Three experiments are performed over East Asia at a horizontal resolution of 50 km, driven by the outputs from a global model of the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC3.2_hires), two without (Exp.1 for the present and Exp.2 for the future) and one with (Exp.3 for the future) the radiative effects of dust aerosols. Effects of climate changes on dust aerosols and the feedback of radiative effects in the future are investigated by comparing differences of Exp.2 and Exp.1, Exp.3 and Exp.2, respectively. Results show that global warming will lead to the increases of dust emissions and column burden by 2% and 14% over East Asia, characterized by the increase in December–January–February–March (DJFM) and the decrease in April–May (AM). Similar variations are also seen in the projected frequencies of high dust emission events, showing an advanced active season of dust in the future. The net top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative forcing is positive over the desert source regions and negative over downwind regions, while the surface radiative forcing is negative over the domain, which will lead to a reduction of dust emissions and column burden.",

Carbon emissions peaking scenarios, consistent with China's Paris commitment, have been simulated with seven national and industry-level energy models and compared. The CO2 emission trends in the considered scenarios peak from 2015 to 2030 at the level of 9–11 Gt. Sector-level analysis suggests that total emissions pathways before 2030 will be determined mainly by dynamics of emissions in the electric power industry and transportation sector. Both sectors will experience significant increase in demand, but have low-carbon alternative options for development. Based on a side-by-side comparison of modeling input and results, conclusions have been drawn regarding the sources of emissions projections differences, which include data, views on economic perspectives, or models' structure and theoretical framework. Some suggestions have been made regarding energy models' development priorities for further research.",

This paper examines the operationalization of the CBDRRC principle in one of the cornerstone rules of the regime—its transparency provisions, both in existing practice under the convention and possible evolvement in negotiations under the Paris Agreement, from the perspectives of both international rule-making and domestic implementation. The authors have found a continuous enhancement of the transparency framework since the 1990s, and gradual consolidation of a bifurcated system between developed and developing countries into a common one. The authors argue that the transparency framework, as part of the procedural rules, should be designed to facilitate transparent information sharing in accordance with substantive commitments under international climate change laws. Thus, it indirectly reflects historical responsibilities for climate change, while the framework should also be designed as feasible and reflective of the respective capabilities of nations. Finally, the evolution of the transparency framework will aim to enact common and enhanced provisions while differentiating between developed and developing countries in the near term, and greater transparency-related capacity-building for developing countries.",

It also quantitatively separates the impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff change in the Tao River by using RCC-WBM model. Results indicate that temperature presented a significant rising trend (0.2 °C per decade) while precipitation exhibited an insignificant decreasing trend (3.8 mm per decade) during 1956–2015. Recorded runoff in the Tao River decreased significantly with a magnitude of −13.7 mm per decade and abrupt changes in 1968 and 1986 were identified. Relative to the baseline period (1956–1968), runoff in the two anthropogenic disturbed periods of 1969–1986 and 1987–2015 decreased by 27.8 mm and 76.5 mm, respectively, which can be attributed to human activities (accounting for 69%) and climate change (accounting for 31%). Human activities are the principal drivers of runoff reduction in the Tao River Basin. However, the absolute influences on runoff reductions by the both drivers tend to increase, from 7.7 mm in 1969–1986 to 24.4 mm in 1987–2015 by climate change and from 20.2 mm to 52.2 mm by human activities.",

    "abstract": "Southern California has seen a resurgence of winegrowing regions in the past few decades, however the future of winegrape climatic suitability in the area has not been exhaustively explored. This study evaluated the future climate suitability for the cultivation of winegrape and potential global warming impacts on southern California's winegrowing regions through a series of high-resolution surface air temperature and precipitation projections obtained with the WRF-SSIB regional climate model. Results reveal that by mid-21st-century the surface air temperature will increase by approximately 1.2 °C, while average precipitation will decrease by as much as 11% in the southern winegrowing areas under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change high greenhouse-gas emissions scenario. Evaluation of bioclimatic suitability indices indicate increases in heat accumulation for all major winegrowing areas; including an increase of about 10% in growing-degree day, while morning low temperatures in September may experience increases of approximately 11% in the future, thus impacting negatively the ripening stage of grapevines and leading to changes in wine composition and quality. Additionally, the extent of areas classified under the cool to warm climate suitability categories could decrease by nearly 42% in the study area by 2050. Conditions in southern California are already warm and dry for viticulture and continuing heat accumulation increase, along with rainfall reduction, could potentially place additional stress to winegrape crop in the area, including advanced phenological timing and moisture deficit stress that could lead to decreases in yield. The projected decline in viticulture suitability highlights the need for adaptive capacity within this sector to mitigate the impacts of global warming. Possible mitigating strategies include planting hotter climate grape varieties, moving vineyards to regions that are more suitable in the future, and adopting dry-farming techniques.",

We provide such a projection here based on the climate projections of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). The projections are given for 20 tide-gauge stations along the coast of China, Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Vertical land motion (VLM) is also estimated for stations that have tide gauge records and satellite altimetry both covering the period of 1993–2018. Local land motion (LLM) is then estimated by subtracting the land motion due to glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) from VLM. Without considering LLM, sea level rise by 2100 at median probability is projected to be 38–49 cm relative to the average sea level over 1986–2005 under warming of 1.5 °C, and increase to 46–57 cm when the warming threshold is increased to 2.0 °C. The steric component is the main contributor to this increase in sea level. Inclusion of LLM will not affect the sea level increase between the two warming thresholds, but it will make the local sea level rise by 2100 at certain locations substantially higher (up to 36 cm) or lower (up to 13 cm).",

In this study, we analyzed the spatial and temporal variations of the ground surface freezing and thawing indices from 1900 to 2017 for the upper Brahmaputra River (also called the Yarlung Zangbo River in China) Basin (UBRB), southwestern Tibetan Plateau, with the air freezing and thawing indices using the University of Delaware (UDEL) monthly gridded air temperature dataset. The abrupt change years for air freezing index (AFI) and ground surface freezing index (GFI) were detected in 1999 and 2002, respectively, and for both air thawing index (ATI) and ground surface thawing index (GTI) were 2009. With the air temperature rising at a rate of 0.006 °C per year over 1900–2017, the AFI and GFI decreased at a rate of −0.1 °C d per year, while the ATI and GTI increased at rates of 0.3 and 0.5 °C d per year before the abrupt change year, respectively; all changing trends of freezing/thawing indices increased after the abrupt year, which was −2.9, −0.8, 7.3, and 21.7 °C d per year for the AFI, GFI, ATI, and GTI, respectively. We utilized the surface frost number model to obtain the dynamics of the frozen ground over the UBRB. When the empirical coefficient of E was assigned to 1.2, the simulated frozen ground occupied about 53.2% of the whole UBRB in the 1990s, which agreed well with the existing permafrost map published in 1996. The area of frozen ground accounts for 51.5%–54.5% of the UBRB during 1900–2017. This result may facilitate further studies of the multi-interactions among the frozen ground and relevant eco-environment, such as the air-ground surface energy exchange, hydrological cycles, and changes of the active layer thickness over the UBRB.",

This study focuses on the development of Pakistan's GHG (CO2, CH4, and N2O) inventories for agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) and waste sectors using 2006 IPCC Guidelines. This study should be seen as a direct continuation of the preceding one (Part I [ Available online at: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.accre.2020.05.002]) which discusses energy and industrial processes and product use in compliance with the 2006 and 1996 IPCC Guidelines. It also provides sector-specific comparative time series (1994–2017) analysis of GHG inventories, identification of key categories, and national GHG emissions trend for Pakistan. The results indicate an average relative difference (on average for time series 1994–2017) of 19% and 6% in total GHG emissions (CO2-eq) from AFOLU and waste sector respectively between 2006 and 1996 IPCC Guidelines. The absolute difference over the entire time series for AFOLU and waste sector was in the range of 3–67 Mt CO2-eq and 1–7 Mt CO2-eq respectively. Findings further reveal that the quantity of national GHG emissions by 2006 IPCC Guidelines is 10% lower on average for complete time series compared to 1996 IPCC Guidelines. The average relative difference for total national emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O is −1%, 9%, and 48% respectively. Key category analysis based on 2006 IPCC Guidelines estimates identified three categories, each contributing ≥10% to the level assessment in the latest year 2017 and accounting for approximately half of the national GHG emissions. In order to further improve the reliability of GHG inventories, Pakistan needs to move from 1996 to 2006 IPCC Guidelines under a higher Tier approach particularly for identified key categories.",

This retreat has increased the probability of the opening of the Arctic Passages in the near future. The Northwest Passage (NWP) is the most direct shipping route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, producing notable economic benefits. Decadal variations of sea ice and its influencing factors from a high-resolution unstructured-grid finite-volume community ocean model were investigated along the NWP in 1988–2016, and the accessibility of the NWP was assessed under shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP245 and 585) and two vessel classes with the Arctic transportation accessibility model in 2021–2050. Sea ice thickness has decreased with increasing seawater temperature and salinity, especially within the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) in 1988–2016, which has facilitated the opening of the NWP. Complete ship navigation is projected to be possible for polar class 6 ships in August–December in 2021–2025, after when it may extends to July under SSP585 in 2026–2030, while open water ships will not be able to pass through the NWP until September in mid-21st century. The navigability of the NWP is mainly affected by the ice within the CAA. For the accessibility of the Parry Channel, the west part is worse than that of the eastern part, especially in the Viscount-Melville Sound.",

However, the influence of glaciers on catchment characteristics within the framework has yet been adequately investigated. Here we extend the Budyko framework and apply the elasticity method to examine the effects of glaciers on runoff between 2001 and 2010 in 25 upstream catchments of the Tarim River Basin in western China. The consideration of glacier mass balance and glacier fraction improves the performance of the Budyko framework, especially for the catchments with a high glacier fraction. We found that the catchment characteristic parameter ω was strongly affected by glacier fraction, and it changes from 1.15 to 2.09 when glacier fraction decreases from 0.4191 to 0.0005. This also reflects the change in water–energy partitioning that eventually effects on evapotranspiration and runoff. We further assessed the average runoff responses to changes in precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, glacier mass balance, and glacier fraction in the 25 catchments. Although the runoff appears most sensitive to precipitation in average, its sensitivity to glacier mass balance and glacier area in fact rises from −0.07% to 0.17% and about 0–0.54%, respectively, when the glacier fraction increases from 0.0005 to 0.4191, further demonstrating the increasing influence of glaciers when the fraction becomes larger. After all, the inclusion of glacier factors in the Budyko framework allows us to understand more about the impacts and contributions of glaciers to runoff at a catchment scale.",

Each sub-index implied that the socio-economic impacts caused by climate change in China have been alleviated gradually; specifically, the mainstream endeavor of key sectors has witnessed remarkable progress, however, it is worth noting that the gap between individual adaptation actions and policies still exists; the implementation effect of policies in key sectors is not as affluent as that of actions; the current adaptation endeavor in key areas is still closely related to the mainstream business of corresponding competent ministries rather than adaptation-aimed actions; the national adaptation policy framework has been primarily formed, but there are still some deficiencies. As a result, the gap in China's adaptation process could be mainly manifested in the following five aspects: i) adaptation effectiveness assessment in forestry and urban infrastructure is urgently needed; ii) policies in marine and water resources sectors need structural reforms; iii) evaluation criteria for national adaptation are not necessarily sufficient; iv) the improvement of adaptive management efficiency has stagnated recently; and v) the adaptation works of relevant Ministries should be coordinated and put forward the corresponding strategies. Finally, this study presents four proposals: conducting an evaluation of adaptation actions in all key sectors, integrating climate change impacts into sectoral planning decisions, launching concrete action plans for adaptation, establishing a complete policy framework on adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Understanding historical wildfire variations and their environmental driving mechanisms is key to predicting and mitigating wildfires. However, current knowledge of climatic responses and regional contributions to the interannual variability (IAV) of global burned area remains limited. Using recent satellite-derived wildfire products and simulations from version v1.0 of the land component of the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM land model [ELM] v1) driven by three different climate forcings, we investigated the burned area IAV and its climatic sensitivity globally and across nine biomes from 1997 to 2018. We found that 1) the ELM simulations generally agreed with the satellite observations in terms of the burned area IAV magnitudes, regional contributions, and covariations with climate factors, confirming the robustness of the ELM to the usage of different climate forcing sources; 2) tropical savannas, tropical forests, and semi-arid grasslands near deserts were primary contributors to the global burned area IAV, collectively accounting for 71.7%–99.7% of the global wildfire IAV estimated by both the satellite observations and ELM simulations; 3) precipitation was a major fire suppressing factor and dominated the global and regional burned area IAVs, and temperature and shortwave solar radiation were mostly positively related with burned area IAVs; and 4) noticeable local discrepancies between the ELM and remote-sensing results occurred in semi-arid grasslands, croplands, boreal forests, and wetlands, likely caused by uncertainties in the current ELM fire scheme and the imperfectly derived satellite observations. Our findings revealed the spatiotemporal diversity of wildfire variations, regional contributions and climatic responses, and provided new metrics for wildfire modeling, facilitating the wildfire prediction and management.",

Consequently, to raise environmental resilience and sustain human wellbeing, we need to overhaul the policy-making process towards a ‘holistic approach’. The nexus approach has proven a valuable tool for identifying gaps and incoherencies in current policies, for understanding major interlinkages across sectors and scales, and for promoting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Nevertheless, a ‘silo approach’ to decision making currently prevails, thus achieving cross-sectoral and cross-scale harmonization still remains a challenge in policy-making. In response to this challenge, the next step in the science–policy–practice interface is to integrate the nexus approach in the ‘climate services’ arena, in order to support integrated policies. Climate services embody a bridge between researchers and stakeholders, and by supporting integrated policies they will ensure synergies between sectors and scales, reduce potential trade-offs, and enable co-benefits.",

Previous studies have proposed a range of allocations of global carbon budgets, but few have quantified the equity–efficiency interaction. Based on an investigation of the existing allocation literature, this study conducts a novel analysis using a 'mixed' allocation 'big-data' framework to understand the equity–efficiency interaction in the distribution of global carbon budgets under 2 °C and 1.5 °C warming targets. At a global scale, a carbon Gini coefficient and aggregate abatement costs are used as quantitative metrics to reflect equity and efficiency, respectively. Results show an equity–efficiency frontier that reflects the opportunity for the international community to co-improve equity and efficiency on top of existing allocations. However, the frontier also features strong trade-offs to further improve equity and efficiency if national allocations are to be achieved individually. Our analysis verifies that such trade-offs are sensitively dependent on the level of global connection and integration. Linking national mitigation actions and potentials can help promote equity–efficiency synergies and contribute to the efficient achievement of the Paris Agreement's temperature and equity goals.",

    "abstract": "Sea ice hinders the navigability of the Arctic, especially in winter and spring. However, three Arc7 ice-class Liquefied Natural Gas carrying vessels safely transited the Northern Sea Route (NSR) without icebreaker assistance in January 2021. More and more Arc7 ice-class vessels are putting into the transit services in the NSR. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze sea-ice conditions and their impact on navigation during wintertime, and the future navigability of Arc7 ice-class vessels along the NSR during winter and spring. Based on sea ice datasets from satellite observations and a model using data assimilation, we explored the sea-ice conditions and their impact during the first three successful commercial voyages through the NSR in winter. In addition, we analyzed the sea ice variation and estimated navigability for Arc7 ice-class vessels in the NSR from January to June of the years 2021–2050 using future projections of the sea-ice cover by the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models under two emission scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). The results reveal lower sea ice thickness and similar sea ice concentration during these three transits relative to the past 42 years (from 1979 to 2020). We found the thickness has a larger impact on the vessels' speeds than sea ice concentration. Very likely sea ice thickness played a larger role than the sea ice concentration for the successful transit of the NSR in winter 2021. Future projections suggest sea ice thickness will decrease further in most regions of the NSR from January to June under all scenarios enabling increased navigability of the NSR for Arc7 ice-class vessels. Such vessels could transit through the NSR from January to June under all scenarios by 2050, while some areas near the coast of East Siberian Sea remain inaccessible for Arc7 ice-class vessels in spring (April and May). These findings can support the strategic planning of shipping along the NSR in winter and spring.",

    "abstract": "China has experienced rapid urbanization since the 1980s, which has significantly reduced croplands around cities. Apart from transition to urban land, croplands have also experienced degradation into cropland/natural vegetation mosaic in the rural–urban fringe. However, scant attention has been paid to the climatic effect of such land cover change so far. This study thus investigated the potential impacts of the conversion from irrigated cropland into the mosaic on regional hot extremes and heat stress by taking the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) as an example. Four heatwave events in the summer of 2013 and 2017 were simulated using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF). Three group experiments with various representative land cover scenarios, i.e., a default setting experiment with outdated land cover (Exp USGS), a control experiment with updated land cover (CTL), and a sensitivity experiment with modified mosaic land cover (Exp MOS), were performed for comparative analyses. Results show that CTL using the updated land cover data from China (ChinaLC) reproduced the spatial variation of observed 2-m air temperature and relative humidity better than Exp USGS. After the irrigated cropland was converted into the mosaic, the 2-m temperatures in most areas of the YRD became significantly higher than those in Exp MOS due to the lower albedo and leaf area index (LAI) in the newly emerged mosaic areas. The land cover change produced a negative contribution to the urban heat island (UHI) intensity, while it had a positive effect on extreme high temperature under heat wave conditions. This suggests a more cautious usage of the traditional definition of the UHI index is required when investigating the heat island effect, because the rural warming around an urban area may expand the heat island and enhance its heat effect. During the heatwave periods, the high temperature areas in CTL were larger than those in MOS, and the hot day areas increased by an average of 25.9%. Increase in air temperature further enhanced regional heat stress. Those results imply that the effects of land cover change in the rural–urban fringe may increase the risks of extreme hot events and heat stress for urban residents under global warming.",

In this study, we used three widely applied integrated assessment models—FUND, RICE, and PAGE—to estimate the damage under coupled shared socioeconomic pathways and representative concentration pathways (RCPs). Results show that the costs of climate damage constitute approximately 1.5% and 0.7% of China's GDP and global GDP per 1 °C temperature rise on average, respectively. Mitigation can reduce climate risk by lowering the average estimate and worst-case effects of climate damage. Compared with business-as-usual emissions (RCP8.5), the 2 °C target will reduce the average estimate of climate damage for China and the world by 93% and 87%, respectively, and by 80% and 84%, respectively, in the worst-case situation. Sectorial analysis of climate damage highlights the inconsistency of sector scope and significant parameter uncertainties in damage modules, requiring further improvement to integrate subfield research advances, particularly for damage related to rising sea levels and cooling energy demand.",

    "abstract": "Owing to the scarcity of observation data in the western Tibetan Plateau (TP), the knowledge of precipitation changes over the entire plateau based only on the limited data in eastern TP is not reliable. Therefore, the alternative high-resolution precipitation data of the China Meteorological Forcing Dataset (CMFD) are used for the comprehensive analysis of precipitation changes over the whole TP (including western and northern TP) to fill in the lack of understanding of precipitation in the western TP. Compared with observations, CMFD can broadly capture the spatial distributions and identify the temporal variabilities of precipitation over the TP. Results with CMFD data suggested that the annual precipitation over the whole TP did not show a uniform humidification trend in 1979–2018 and featured wetting and drying trends in the northern (NTP) and southern TP (STP), respectively. Additionally, the four seasonal regimes of precipitation over the northern TP (NTP, including most areas of western TP) all experienced a noticeable interdecadal shift around the late 1990s, followed by above-normal precipitation. Except for spring, the seasonal precipitation over the southern TP (STP) showed interannual variations. Spring precipitation over the STP has undergone moistening since the late 1990s, which was consistent with that over the NTP. Four different reanalysis datasets, namely JRA55, MERRA2, ERA5 and CRA40, were used to compare the water vapour budget of each boundary over the TP. The increase in spring precipitation over the NTP and STP was found to be related to the decrease in water vapour outflow from the north boundary. The interdecadal increase in summer precipitation over the NTP was mainly due to the reduction of outflow from the east boundary. Finally, the increase in autumn precipitation was related to the increase in inflow from the west boundary.",

    "abstract": "Floods caused by extreme weather events and climate change have increased in occurrence and severity all over the world, resulting in devastation and disruption of activities. Researchers and policy practitioners have increasingly paid attention to the role of critical infrastructure (CI) in disaster risk reduction, flood resilience and climate change adaptation in terms of its backbone functions in maintaining societal services in hazard attacks. The analysed city in this study, Xinxiang (Henan province, China), was affected by an extreme flood event that occurred on 17–23 July 2021, which caused great socio-economic losses. However, few studies have focused on medium-sized cities and the flood cascading effects on CI during this event. Therefore, this study explores the damages caused by this flooding event with links to CI, such as health services, energy supply stations, shelters and transport facilities (HEST infrastructure). To achieve this, the study first combines RGB (red, green blue) composition and supervised classification for flood detection to monitor and map flood inundation areas. Second, it manages a multiscenario simulation and evaluates the cascading effects on HEST infrastructure. Diverse open-source data are employed, including Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and Landsat-8 OIL data, point-of-interest (POI) and OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. The study reveals that this extreme flood event has profoundly affected croplands and villagers. Due to the revisiting period of Sentinel-1 SAR data, four scenarios are simulated to portray the retreated but 'omitted' floodwater: Scenario 0 is the flood inundation area on 27 July, and Scenarios 1, 2 and 3 are built based on this information with a buffer of 50, 100 and 150 m outwards, respectively. In the four scenarios, as the inundation areas expand, the affected HEST infrastructure becomes more clustered at the centre of the core study area, indicating that those located in the urban centre are more susceptible to flooding. Furthermore, the affected transport facilities assemble in the north and east of the core study area, implying that transport facilities located in the north and east of the core study area are more susceptible to flooding. The verification of the flood inundation maps and affected HEST infrastructure in the scenario simulation support the series method adopted in this study. The findings of this study can be used by flood managers, urban planners and other decision makers to better understand extreme historic weather events in China, improve flood resilience and decrease the negative impacts of such events on HEST infrastructure.",

However, the changes in summer precipitation of different intensities over the TRH region, along with their influencing factors, remain unclear. In this study, we used observational and ERA5 reanalysis data and employed a precipitation categorization and water vapor budget analysis to quantify the categorized precipitation variations and investigate their possible linkages with the water vapor budget. Our results showed an increasing trend in summer precipitation at a rate of 0.9 mm per year (p < 0.1) during 1979‒2020, with a significant dry-to-wet transition in 2002. The category 'very heavy precipitation' (≥ 10 mm d−1) contributed 65.1% of the increased summer precipitation, which occurred frequently in the northern TRH region. The dry-to-wet transition was caused by the effects of varied atmospheric circulations in each subregion. Southwesterly water vapor transport through the southern boundary was responsible for the increased net water vapor flux in the western TRH region (158.2%), while southeasterly water vapor transport through the eastern boundary was responsible for the increased net water vapor flux in the central TRH (155.2%) and eastern TRH (229.2%) regions. Therefore, we inferred that the dry-to-wet transition of summer precipitation and the increased 'very heavy precipitation' over the TRH was caused by increased easterly and southerly water vapor transport.",

The study further documents an intense MHW event from late 2020 to early 2021 within the latitude range of 17.5°–24°N, attributing its development to oceanic processes such as anticyclonic eddies and current-driven heat transport. The occurrence of this MHW event potentially increased thermal stress on the Campeche and Tuxtlas Reef Systems. This research illuminates the increasing trends and impacts of MHWs in the GoM, providing valuable insights for understanding and predicting the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Compared with physical models, WRF-Solar, as an excellent numerical forecasting model, includes abundant novel cloud physical and dynamical processes, which enablesenable the high-frequency output of radiation components which are urgently needed by the solar energy industry. However, the popularisation of WRF-Solar in a wide range of applications, such as the estimation of diffuse radiation, suffers from unpredictable influences of cloud and aerosol optical property parameters. This study assessed the accuracy of the improved numerical weather prediction (WRF-Solar) model in simulating global and diffuse radiation. Aerosol optical properties at 550 nm, which were provided by a moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer, were used as input to analyse the differences in accuracies obtained by the model with/without aerosol input. The sensitivity of WRF-Solar to aerosol and cloud optical properties and solar zenith angle (SZA) was analysed. The results show the superiority of WRF-Solar to WRF-Dudhia in terms of their root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The coefficients of determination between WRF-Solar and WRF-Dudhia revealed no statistically significant difference, with values greater than 0.9 for the parent and nested domains. In addition, the relative RMSE (RRMSE%) reached 46.60%. The experiment on WRF-Solar and WRF-Dudhia revealed a negative bias for global radiation, but WRF-Solar attained a slightly lower RMSE and higher correlation coefficient than WRF-Dudhia. The WRF-Solar-simulated results on diffuse radiation under clear sky conditions were slightly poorer, with RMSE, RRMSE, mean percentage error and MAE of 181.93 W m−2, 170.52%, 93.04% and 138 W m−2, respectively. Based on Himawari-8 cloud data, statistical results on cloud optical thickness (COT) for cloudy days revealed that WRF-Solar overestimated diffuse radiation at COTs greater than 20. Moreover, when the aerosol optical depth was greater than or equal to 0.8, WRF-Solar also overestimated the diffuse radiation, with a mean difference of 58.57 W m−2. The errors of WRF-Solar simulations in global and diffuse radiation exhibited a significant dependence on the SZA. The dispersion degree of deviation increased gradually with the decrease in the SZA. Thus, WRF-Solar serves as an improved numerical tool that can provide high temporal and high-spatial-resolution solar radiation data for the prediction of photovoltaic power. Studies should explore the improvement of cumulus parameterisation schemes to enhance the accuracy of solar radiation component estimation and prediction under cloudy conditions.",

    "abstract": "In late November 2022, most regions in China were hit by a strong northwest-path cold wave, bringing a high-hazard extreme low-temperature event (ELTE). Several parts of Northwest China experienced extremely low temperatures and record-breaking snow depths. A stratosphere‒troposphere synergetic effect was suggested to be closely related to the ELTE according to a diagnostic analysis. On the one hand, the concurrent establishment of two blockings in Europe–Northeast Atlantic and North Pacific led to a polar vortex split at the tropopause, and the Arctic Oscillation phase subsequently turned negative. An airflow with high potential vorticity (PV) was squeezed out of the Arctic. Meanwhile, a high-PV air that originated from the lower stratospheric Arctic was conveyed southwards to the western Siberian Plain along the sloping isentropic surface. This condition triggered a tropospheric response in which the East Asia trough deepened due to the intensified cyclonic circulation induced by the high-PV intrusion. On the other hand, downward propagation of stratospheric anomalies accompanied by stratospheric polar vortex displacement and split was observed in mid- and late November, respectively. Changes in stratospheric circulation contributed to enhanced blockings over Europe‒Northeast Atlantic in the lower stratosphere or upper troposphere. As a result, the inverted omega-shaped circulation pattern was formed in the middle to upper troposphere, and it consisted of the intensified East Asia trough and two blockings in the upstream and downstream regions. The high-PV air upstream of the East Asia trough was advected to China, which directly led to the outbreak of the ELTE. The establishment of double blockings and the displacement or split of the stratospheric polar vortex can be efficient signals for cold-event prediction in China. This study provides novel insights into the cause of ELTEs under warming climates in the future.",

    "abstract": "Zoonoses account for the majority of emerging infectious diseases and pose a serious threat to human and animal health. Under global warming and climate change, zoonoses are significantly affected by influencing hosts, vectors, and pathogen dynamics as well as their interactions. Traditional zoonoses surveillance relies on molecular or serological diagnostic methods to monitor pathogens from animal or patient samples, which may miss the early warning signs of pathogens spillover from the environment. Nowadays, new technologies such as remote sensing, environment-based screening, multi-omics, and big data science facilitate comprehensive active surveillance, offering great potential for early warning and prediction. Despite the recent technological advances, there is few reviews that explores the integration of cutting-edge technologies aimed at constructing a robust early warning system. Therefore, we discussed the opportunities, barriers, and limitations of interdisciplinary emerging technologies for exploring early warning and surveillance of zoonoses. This systematic review summarized a practical framework for early surveillance integrated with a modified SEIR model for zoonoses in the context of climate change. It also outlined challenges and future prospects in terms of data sharing, early detection of unknown zoonoses and the move towards global surveillance.",

    "abstract": "The U-shaped crushed rock embankment (UCRE), of which widely utilized in the permafrost regions along the Qinghai‒Tibet Railway, has the capability to rapidly reduce the ground temperature of the underlying permafrost. However, there remains uncertainty regarding the adaptation of UCRE to climate change and its long-term cooling trend. This study focuses on nine UCRE monitoring sites along the Qinghai‒Tibet Railway to analyze the dynamic variations of the ground temperature underlying permafrost from 2006 to 2020. The efficiency of UCRE in stabilizing permafrost temperature in different permafrost zones is evaluated by considering the permafrost table, ground temperature, and MAGT, as well as the temperature difference between the top and bottom of the crushed rock layer and the ground temperature variation index (GTVI). The results show that UCRE is suitable for application in extremely unstable warm permafrost regions where the MAGT is higher than −0.5 °C. Moreover, UCRE effectively diminishes the disparity in permafrost thermal stability between the sunny and shaded shoulders of the embankment. The short-term and long-term effect of cooling permafrost is experiencing a change related with permafrost stability. Notably, in stable cold permafrost regions with MAGT lower than −1.5 °C, the long-term cooling effect of UCRE on permafrost seems to gradually diminishes, but UCRE continues to fulfill the role of stabilizing the underlying permafrost thermal state over the long-term. These results show that UCRE can quickly restore and stabilize the thermal state of permafrost in the early stages of construction, and adapt to the influence of future climate change. The findings provide important guidance for understanding the variations of permafrost thermal stability beneath the embankment in permafrost regions, as well as for improving the embankment stability and operational safety of the Qinghai‒Tibet Railway.",

    "abstract": "Rapid urbanization has led to changes in the urban land surface thermal environment. However, there are still much unknown about the urban land surface thermal conditions in permafrost regions. Permafrost is a unique geological environment, changes in the urban land surface thermal environment may trigger geological disasters caused by permafrost degradation. This study utilized remote sensing data and geographic detectors to identify the dynamic changes in land surface temperature (LST) and land use/land cover (LU/LC) in Yakutsk, as well as the potential factors contributing to LST variations. Between 1992 and 2020, the built-up area in Yakutsk increased by 36%, and the annual average LST in Yakutsk has risen by 6.67°C, accompanied by an expansion of high-temperature areas. Despite ongoing greening efforts, rapid urbanization poses a threat to these green spaces. Changes in the normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) and land use transfer (LDT) were identified as the primary drivers of urban LST changes. By integrating geographic detector technology and artificial neural network models, we optimized the selection of input factors in the prediction model and used it to explore the future changes in LST in Yakutsk. The average LST in Yakutsk is expected to reach 23.4°C and 25.1°C in 2030 and 2040, respectively, with a further increase in high-temperature areas. This study provides a reference for ecological, hydrological, and geological assessments of cities in permafrost regions.",

    "abstract": "Warming and nitrogen (N) addition may impact soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, but the relationship between plant community composition and soil microbial activities remains unclear. For a two-year field study in the Qinghai‒Tibet Plateau, open-top chambers were used to quantify the effects of warming, N-addition, and their interactions on N2O emissions. We found that the N-addition greatly increased N2O emissions by 77.4% in 2018 when compared to the control group. In contrast, warming showed little effect on N2O emissions but did increase the activity of enzymes associated with soil nitrification and denitrification. A combined effect of warming and N-addition of resulted in 208.6% (2018) and 90.8% (2019) increase in N2O emissions, respectively, compared to the individual treatments of warming or N-addition. Global warming in alpine meadows is causally linked to increased legume biomass which is further intensified with the N-addition. Intensified legume biomass (p<0.05), soil moisture (p<0.001) and enzyme activity (p<0.001) had a positive effect on N2O emissions, while diminished microbial carbon/nitrogen (MBC/MBN) (p<0.05) correlated with reduced N2O emissions. Final results indicated that N-addition has a positive effect on N2O emissions, and the addition of warming further intensifies this effect. The increased dominance of legumes and microbial N content contributes to this effect. These outcomes suggest that warming and atmospheric N deposition can stimulate N2O emissions of alpine meadows in the future.",

However, the mechanism behind this phenomenon remains unclear. Hence, we analysed the interdecadal changes in vegetation response to drought on the basis of the standardised precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and Global Inventory Modelling and Mapping Studies LAI4g datasets, with an emphasis on the differences between direct and legacy effects (as measured by resilience), to explore the mechanism of persistent grassland greening. Results revealed that during the post-drought shift period (2000‒2020), the sudden decrease in the water content of the intermediate soil layer triggered an intensified vegetation response to drought. Specifically, although direct effects and resilience were amplified, they exhibited asymmetric changes. Resilience was stronger than direct effects, and this difference increased with increasing drought (drought recovery) levels. These combined effects may account for persistent greening against intensified drying in the semiarid grasslands in NEA. Given the projected exacerbation of future droughts, this study holds notable importance for comprehending the long-term change dynamics of dryland ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Loss and damage caused by extreme climate events have attracted increasing attention. The 28th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (hereinafter referred to as the Convention) has agreed to adopt Loss and Damage Fund agreement, which identified the source of funding and the funds to be entrusted to the World Bank. However, there is still ambiguous that how to allocate the funds could accelerate the effectiveness of meeting the needs for developing countries. Pre-disaster prevention and preparedness is one of the most effective measures to deal with loss and damage, which closely related to adaptation. Previous studies rarely analyzed quantitatively the financial needs of pre-disaster prevention and preparedness relating to adaptation to reduce loss and damage. Based on the official reports submitted by countries under the Convention, this study analyzes the annual change in the total financial support provided by developed countries to developing countries, the proportion of pre-disaster prevention and preparedness in the adaptation needs of developing countries, and the progress in raising the current annual funding target of 100 billion USD for developed countries, to reveal the financial and technical challenges facing by developing countries on addressing loss and damage. The results show that by 2030, the total adaptation financial needs of developing countries are estimated to be about 3.8 trillion USD, of which pre-disaster prevention matters account for about 9%. Therefore, by 2030, developing countries will need about 342 billion USD in pre-disaster prevention and preparedness finance to withstand loss and damage. In addition, developing countries face a lack of technical methods to quantify information about their needs. Based on the above analysis, this study puts forward countermeasures and suggestions, including strengthening the allocation amount of loss and damage fund on pre-disaster warning, prevention and control actions, and establishing track modalities on the finance provided by developed countries to developing countries based on the principles of the principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC), to provide favorable guarantee for accelerating the effectiveness of international climate governance.",

    "abstract": "Thermokarst lake formation accelerates permafrost degradation due to climate warming, thereby releasing significant amounts of carbon into the atmosphere, complicating hydrological cycles, and causing environmental damage. However, the energy transfer mechanism from the surface to the sediment of thermokarst lakes remains largely unexplored, thereby limiting our understanding of the magnitude and duration of biogeochemical processes and hydrological cycles. Therefore, herein, a typical thermokarst lake situated in the center of the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP) was selected for observation and energy budget modeling. Our results showed that the net radiation of the thermokarst lake surface was 95.1, 156.9, and 32.3 W m−2 for the annual, ice-free, and ice-covered periods, respectively, and was approximately 76% of the net radiation consumed by latent heat flux. Alternations in heat storage in the thermokarst lake initially increased from January to April, then decreased from April to December, with a maximum change of 48.1 W m−2 in April. The annual average heat fluxes from lake water to sediments were 1.4 W m−2; higher heat fluxes occurred during the ice-free season at a range of 4.9–12.0 W m−2. The imbalance between heat absorption and release in the millennium scale caused the underlying permafrost of the thermokarst lake to completely thaw. At present, the ground temperature beneath the lake bottom at a depth of 15 m has reached 2.0 °C. The temperatures and vapor-pressure conditions of air and lake surfaces control the energy budget of the thermokarst lake. Our findings indicate that changes in the hydrologic regime shifts and biogeochemical processes are more frequent under climate warming and permafrost degradation.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogen and electricity are crucial and interdependent energy carriers in China's pursuit of carbon neutrality, suggesting the necessity of utilizing cost-effective low-carbon technologies that facilitate their integrated development. The cost-optimal, provincial level, deployment of low-carbon technologies under this long-term goal remains to be determined. This study employs the REPO model to identify the cost-optimal, low-carbon hydrogen production mixes and the evolution of the integrated power system of China from 2020 to 2050. The integrated planning and operation of hydrogen supply and power systems are explored at the provincial level. The role of high-temperature gas-cooled reactors in this integrated energy system is also analyzed. The results reveal that electrolytic hydrogen would dominate China's hydrogen supply after 2040, with alkaline, proton exchange membrane, and solid oxide electrolyzers produce over 1 Mt of hydrogen in the short term, by 2035, and in 2050. Leveraging the low-carbon heat production of high-temperature gas-cooled reactors in addition to its electricity generation to meet the thermal requirements of solid oxide electrolyzers could boost the output to 4.2 Mt in 2050 and reducing the total system CO2 emissions and costs by 2.28% and 0.05%, respectively. By 2050, the integration of hydrogen supply and power systems also generates up to 2194 TW h of flexible electricity demand by electrolyzers, which raised the renewable energy penetration by 4 percentage points while decreasing the need of flexible natural gas power generations and energy storages. This study is valuable for proposing the analytical framework and performing the provincial-level study of decarbonization of China's integrated hydrogen supply and power system.",

This paper concludes with a suggestion to use a without policy scenario with a clear base year as definition of BaU. Such a definition will set an objective benchmark to assess mitigation efforts of developing countries. Teng, F., and S.-Q.

Spectral analysis of the monthly AO index indicates that 23 out of the 26 CMIP5 models exhibit no statistically significant spectral peak in the historical experiment, as seen in the observations. These models are able to reproduce the AO pattern in the sea level pressure anomaly field during boreal winter, but the intensity of the AO pattern tends to be overestimated in all the models. The zonal-mean zonal wind anomalies associated with the AO is dominated by a meridional dipole in the mid-high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere during boreal winter, which is well reproduced by only a few models. Most models show significant biases in both strength and location of the dipole compared to the observation. In considering the temporal variability as well as spatial structures in both horizontal and vertical directions, the MPI-ESM-P model reproduces an AO pattern that resembles the observation the best.

The core content of energy system revolutionary transformation is to replace the high-carbon energy system dominated by fossil energy with low-carbon energy system dominated by new and renewable energy and finally realize the near-zero emission of CO2. The new energy system transformation has also led to a reform in global economic and social development patterns. Developing low-carbon economy becomes the fundamental strategy of sustainable development under climate risk management and the only solution to getting on the road from industrial civilization to ecological civilization. China intends to achieve the peaking of CO2 emissions around 2030 and increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 20% by 2030. Guided by the targets, China directs its economy development to a low-carbon pattern. Therefore, new and renewable power capacity need to reach 1300 GW, and the electricity generated should be 4 times of that in 2013 with a continuous increase rate of 6%–8% around 2030. The pace of energy substitution need to be accelerated and efficient, safe, clean, and low-carbon energy supply and consumption systems should be established besides strengthened energy conservation and improved energy efficient. Therefore, reform need be deepened, favorable policy system and market mechanism for energy revolution and low-carbon development need be established, energy pricing mechanism should be reformed, and national carbon market should be formed to provide a favorable policy and market environment for low-carbon technology innovation and industry development.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to develop a large-scale climate classification for investigating the characteristics of the climate regimes around the Tibetan Plateau based on seasonal precipitation, moisture transport and moisture divergence using in situ observations and ERA40 reanalysis data. The results indicate that the climate can be attributed to four regimes around the Plateau. They situate in East Asia, South Asia, Central Asia and the semi-arid zone in northern Central Asia throughout the dryland of northwestern China, in addition to the Köppen climate classification. There are different collocations of seasonal temperature and precipitation: 1) in phase for the East and South Asia monsoon regimes, 2) anti-phase for the Central Asia regime, 3) out-of-phase for the westerly regime. The seasonal precipitation concentrations are coupled with moisture divergence, i.e., moisture convergence coincides with the Asian monsoon zone and divergence appears over the Mediterranean-like arid climate region and westerly controlled area in the warm season, while it reverses course in the cold season. In addition, moisture divergence is associated with meridional moisture transport. The northward/southward moisture transport corresponds to moisture convergence/divergence, indicating that the wet and dry seasons are, to a great extent, dominated by meridional moisture transport in these regions. The climate mean southward transport results in the dry-cold season of the Asian monsoon zone and the dry-warm season, leading to desertification or land degradation in Central Asia and the westerly regime zone. The mean-wind moisture transport (MMT) is the major contributor to total moisture transport, while persistent northward transient eddy moisture transport (TEMT) plays a key role in dry season precipitation, especially in the Asian monsoon zone. The persistent TEMT divergence is an additional mechanism of the out-of-phase collocation in the westerly regime zone. In addition, the climate-mean MMT and TEMT are associated with the atmospheric stationary wave and storm track, which results from the uplift of orography and land-sea thermal contrast. Therefore, the paleoclimate changes in mid-latitude arid-semi-arid regions are linked to the different phases of uplift of mountains and plate motion tied to the evolution of the Mediterranean.",

A review of previous research on the detection and attribution of observed changes in annual runoff in China shows a decrease in annual runoff since the 1950s in northern China in areas such as the Songhuajiang River water resources zone, the Liaohe River water resources zone, the Haihe River water resources zone, the Yellow River water resources zone, and the Huaihe River water resources Zone. Furthermore, abrupt changes in annual runoff occurred mostly in the 1970s and 1980s in all the above zones, except for some of the sub-basins in the middle Yellow River where abrupt change occurred in the 1990s. Changes in annual runoff are found to be mainly caused by climate change in the western Songhuajiang River basin, the upper mainstream of the Yangtze River, and the western Pearl River basin, which shows that studies on the impact of climate change on future water resources under different climate change scenarios are required to enable planning and management by agencies in these river basins. However, changes in annual runoff were found to be mainly caused by human activities in most of the catchments in northern China (such as the southern Songhuajiang River, Liaohe River, Haihe River, the lower reach and some of the catchments within the middle Yellow River basin) and in middle-eastern China, such as the Huaihe River and lower mainstream of the Yangtze River. This suggests that current hydro-climatic data can continue to be used in water-use planning and that policymakers need to focus on water resource management and protection.",

It is vital to project changes of this vulnerable ecosystem under different climate change scenarios before taking any mitigation or adaptation measures. In this study, we used a process-based ecosystem model, driven with output from global circulation models under different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), to project the carbon dynamics of alpine grassland. The results showed the following: 1) Vegetation carbon (C) on the QTP increased by 22–38 gC m−2 during periods of 1.5 and 2 °C warming under different RCPs when compared to the baseline period (1981–2006), while soil C increased by 85–122 gC m−2. 2) The increases of vegetation C and soil C at the period of 1.5 °C warming were about 15 gC m−2 and 40 gC m−2 smaller than those at the period of 2 °C warming, respectively; increase of C was greater for alpine meadow than for alpine steppe. 3) Precipitation, radiation, and permafrost changed significantly and showed heterogeneous spatial patterns, and caused heterogeneous response of C dynamics. For alpine meadow in regions transformed from permafrost to seasonally frozen soil with medium annual precipitation (200–400 mm), vegetation C and net primary production decreased by 18.7 gC m−2 and 3.1 gC m−2 per year during 2 °C warming under RCP 4.5, respectively. This decrease can be attributed to the disappearing impermeable permafrost. Different from previous studies that indicated an unfavorable response of alpine grassland to climate warming, this study showed a relatively favorable response, which is mainly attributed to CO2 fertilization.",

Nevertheless, it is necessary for IAMs to update sectoral climate impacts in order to catch up the advance in climate change studies. This study updates the sectoral climate damage function at global scale from climate Framework for Uncertainty, Negotiation and Distribution (FUND) model and develops the aggregate climate damage function in a bottom-up fashion. Besides conventional sectors such as agriculture, forestry, water resources, energy consumption and ecosystems, this study expands climate disaster types, assesses human health impacts caused by various air pollutants, and updates coastal damage by sea level rise. The Beijing Climate Center Simple Earth System Model (BCC_SESM) is used to project climate system based on Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario, and the 2 °C and 1.5 °C scenarios based on RCPs and SSP2 databases. Sectoral results show that the agricultural sector is projected to suffer 63% of the total damage, followed by water resources (16%) and human health (12%) sectors in 2100. The regression results indicate that the aggregate climate damage function is in positive quadratic form for zero discounting. Under BAU scenario, the aggregate climate damage is projected to be 517.7 trillion USD during 2011–2100. Compared to that, the 2 °C and 1.5 °C scenarios are projected to respectively reduce climate damages by 215.6 trillion USD (approximately 41.6%) and 263.5 trillion USD (50.9%) in 2011–2100.",

    "abstract": "Electric power distribution systems are vulnerable to disruption due to severe weather events, especially hurricanes. Such vulnerability is expected to increase over time due to the impact of climate change on hurricanes and the decay of wood poles that support the distribution lines. This study investigates the effectiveness of using fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) sleeve to reinforce wood poles subjected to decay and hurricane hazard to restore their lost strength and extend their effective service life. The potential impact of climate change on the pole decay rate and the intensity and frequency of hurricanes is also considered. The optimal FRP repair time based on the structural reliability of the poles is also determined. Three locations with varying climates are chosen to evaluate and compare the results: Miami, Charleston, and New York City. The results show that in all three locations, the application of the FRP sleeve can more than double the service life of the pole depending on the time of the repair. The results also show that climate change significantly increases the vulnerability of the pole. The probability of failure of the pole at the end of the 21st century under RCP8.5 emission scenario in Miami, Charleston, and New York City increase by about 30%, 70%, and 73%, respectively, compared to a no climate change scenario. If climate change is only assumed to affect the decay of the pole, i.e., no change in hurricane hazard intensity, the corresponding increases in failure probability are 5%, 22%, and 20% in Miami, Charleston, and New York City, respectively. This implies that most of the impact of climate change on pole failure risk is due to the increase in hurricane intensity. The impact of climate change on decay is found to be comparatively small. It increases with time as variation in temperature and precipitation becomes more prominent towards the end of the 21st century. The optimization results show that the optimal FRP repair time depends on how the FRP affects the pole's decay rate. If the FRP can significantly slow down the wood decay rate, the optimal time of repair is at the beginning of the pole's life cycle. If the FRP has no impact on the wood decay rate, it is better to repair the pole after significant decay has occurred.",

In this study, a nested-grid version of global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) is employed to assess the impacts of variations in meteorological parameters, terrestrial fluxes, fossil fuel emissions, and biomass burning on inter-annual variations of CO2 concentrations over East Asia in 2004–2012. Simulated CO2 concentrations are compared with observations at 14 surface stations from the World Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases (WDCGG) and satellite-derived CO2 column density (XCO2) from the Gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT). The comparison shows that the simulated CO2 column density is generally higher than that of GOSAT by 1.33 × 10−6 (annual mean point by point biases averaged over East Asia). The model reasonably captures the temporal variations of CO2 concentrations observed at the ground-based stations, but it is likely to underestimate the peaks-to-troughs amplitude of the seasonal cycle by 50% or more. The simulated surface CO2 concentration in East Asia exhibits the largest inter-annual variation in December-January–February (DJF). The regional mean absolute deviation (MAD) values over East Asia are within (4.4–5.0) × 10−6 for all seasons. Model sensitivity simulations indicate that the inter-annual variations of surface CO2 concentrations are mainly driven by variations of meteorological parameters, and partly modulated by the inter-annual variations of terrestrial fluxes and fossil fuel emissions in local regions. The variations of the terrestrial fluxes and fossil fuel emissions may account for ∼28% of the inter-annual variation of surface CO2 concentration in southern China. The inter-annual variations of the peaks-to-troughs amplitude are dependent on variations of meteorological parameters, terrestrial fluxes and fossil fuel emissions in local regions. The influence of biomass burning emissions is relatively weak.",

    "abstract": "Recently, extremely hot summers occurred frequently across China, and the mean mid-summer surface air temperature (SAT) continuously broke the records of the past decades, causing huge social and economic losses. As global warming accelerates, these extremely hot summers will undoubtedly occur more frequently. However, the issue of what will happen to the mid-summer SAT over China in the near future remains unclear. Therefore, we investigate the changes of mid-summer SAT and related internal variabilities over China at 1.5 °C and 2 °C global warming above preindustrial level by using the MPI-ESM Grand Ensemble simulations. The results indicate that compared to the present-day (1986–2005), national averaged mid-summer SAT will increase by 1.1 °C and 2.0 °C, in 1.5 °C and 2 °C warming scenarios respectively. This means that the mid-summer SAT is projected to increase by 0.9 °C due to an additional 0.5 °C global warming, which is higher than the annual value (0.8 °C) and almost two times the global warming rate. Regionally, in the two warming targets, the increase in mid-summer SAT will be more enhanced over the northwestern part of China. In addition, the extremely high monthly SAT would increase nationwide due to an additional 0.5 °C in global warming. Among all areas, the Qinghai and Xinjiang provinces would experience the strongest increase in extremely high monthly SAT. It is important to find that, from 1.5 °C to 2 °C global warming, changes of the internal variability of the mid-summer SAT differs across China. It would decrease over some parts of western Northwest China, North China, Northeast China and the Tibetan Plateau. However, it would significantly increase over Qinghai, Sichuan, and northern parts of Inner Mongolia. As a result, at 2 °C global warming, the increase of extreme SAT in Qinghai is caused by the synergistic effect of stronger warming rate and larger internal variability. Differently, the increase in Xinjiang province is mainly caused by the stronger local warming. Further analysis suggests that we can effectively reduce the intensity of extremely hot months over most regions of Northwest China by limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, rather than to 2 °C.",

    "abstract": "It is remarkable that the high-end sea level rise threat over the next few hundred years comes almost entirely from only a handful of ice streams and large glaciers. These occupy a few percent of ice sheets' coastline. Accordingly, spatially limited interventions at source may provide globally-equitable mitigation from rising seas. Ice streams control draining of ice sheets; glacier retreat or acceleration serves to greatly increase potential sea level rise. While various climatic geoengineering approaches have been considered, serious consideration of geotechnical approaches has been limited – particularly regarding glaciers. This study summarises novel and extant geotechnical techniques for glacier restraint, identifying candidates for further research. These include draining or freezing the bed; altering surface albedo; creating obstacles: retaining snow; stiffening shear margins with ice; blocking warm sea water entry; thickening ice shelves (increasing buttressing, and strengthening fractured shelves against disintegration); as well as using regional climate engineering or local cloud seeding to cool the glacier or add snow. Not all of these ideas are judged reasonable or feasible, and even fewer are likely to be found to be advisable after further consideration. By describing and evaluating the potential and risks of a large menu of responses – even apparently hopeless ones – we can increase the chances of finding one that works in times of need.",

Thus, research on the assessment of the climate characteristics, activity laws, and variability trends of Arctic cyclones using climate models has practical significance. On the basis of the fifth-generation European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis (ERA5) data, the spatiotemporal variations of Arctic cyclones during 1981–2014 are analyzed by detecting and tracking cyclones using the Lagrangian method. Then, the simulation results of 14 global climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP5) are compared with the results of ERA5. Both the individual models and their ensemble mean can simulate the spatial distribution of the density of cyclone tracks with reasonable capability, the correlation coefficients of track density are approximately 0.6. Furthermore, in boreal winter, the Atlantic zonal negative bias of track density is stronger than that in summer. By contrast, in boreal summer, the negative bias over the Arctic Ocean region is stronger than that in winter. Moreover, the simulations of density -field-related variables (i.e., cyclolysis, cyclogenesis, track, and lowest center pressure densities) of Arctic cyclones are generally better in winter than in summer, and the models can simulate well that the number of external Arctic cyclones entering the Arctic region from the midlatitudes is more than the internal Arctic cyclones generated inside the Arctic region (60°‒90°N). Furthermore, we show that the capability of models to capture Arctic cyclones with a short lifespan (<3 d) is somewhat poor. Except for the simulation of the minimum pressure of Arctic cyclones, the performance of high-resolution models is better than that of low-resolution models. The simulation of Arctic cyclone radius is poor among all of the variables related to Arctic cyclones, and the observed trends of intensities are not well simulated. In general, the simulation of location-field-related variables (i.e., intensity, radius, deepening rate, and center pressure) of Arctic cyclones is better in winter than in summer.",

Critical comparisons are also made with the results of CMIP5 (BCC-CSM1.1 and BCC-CSM1.1m). In general, the CMIP6, especially BCC-CSM2-MR, has smaller deviations in the trends, the means, the mutations, the maximum centers, the variances, and the spatial patterns of the dominant modes from observatio relative to those of CMIP5. However, the BCC CMIP6 models still underestimate the SAT variation in the Qinghai‒Tibetan Plateau and the northeastern regions of China, and the performance is unsatisfactory with respect to the physical drivers of the dominant modes. Importantly, all the BCC models can capture the spatio-temporal characteristics of the first mode well and can, in general, characterize the spatial pattern of the second mode, but none of the models perform well in the principal component of the second mode (PC2) due to the low performance with respect to the interannual variation of PC2. Furthermore, the factors influencing the leading two modes are evaluated. The two CMIP6 can simulate better the Northern Hemisphere subtropical high northern boundary affecting the first mode. Another factor, the Asia polar vortex area, can only be simulated better by two low-resolution models (BCC-CSM1.1 and BCC-ESM1). For the second mode, all four models simulate the influence of Asian zonal circulation well, but poorly simulate that of the southern Indian Ocean dipole due to a large deviation in the Indian Ocean surface temperature.",

    "abstract": "Sea-level rise is a long-term, intractable problem during which costly, large-scale inundation could occur in many countries; hence, tourism development should take this matter into account because ecology and biodiversity are the fundamentals underpinning tourism performance. This study conceptualizes an economic mechanism of the potential effects of sea-level rise on tourism development based on projected impacts for the 2001–2100 period. Data for 48 developing countries across Africa, Asia, and South America are analyzed. The theoretical framework proposes two hypotheses to determine the extent of contradiction between awareness and destruction in relation to environmental protection for tourism development. From the panel data regression results, although destructive effects are bound to dominate the entire 21st century, awareness is latent and has the potential to reverse the destructive outcomes. With evidence from essential economic elements, this study gives new insights into how severe the impacts of sea-level rise on tourism could be if shared values and adaptation measures to mitigate rising sea level are not substantively promoted around the globe. The new findings show a 0.95 standard-deviation decrease in tourism performance following a 1 standard-deviation increase in the economic loss related sea-level rise. Hence, in the main conclusions, we highlight that the projected effect of inundation-related deterioration on a country's tourism sector appears to be approximately on par with the costs of inundations to its economic growth.",

We collected the data on daily mortality, meteorological factors and air pollution in 84 Chinese cities during 2013–2016, which was divided into seven regions. Based on the association between daily maximum temperature and mortality in each city in a threshold distributed lag non-linear model, where the threshold was defined as the temperature corresponding to the lowest mortality risk, we calculated the number of deaths that could be avoided for 1 °C decrease in maximum temperature under different thresholds, then a random-effect meta-analysis was used to generate regional results, in which the temperature with the highest avoidable mortality number for 1 °C decrease was considered as the most appropriate heatwave definition. We observed an immediate detrimental effect of high temperature within three lag days. Our analysis suggested to use 29.5 °C, 31.5 °C, 29.0 °C, 31.5 °C, 30.0 °C, and 28.5 °C as the heatwave standard for east, north, northeast, central, south, and southwest region, with the avoidable mortality number of 1.54 (95 % Confidence interval (CI): 0.88, 2.19), 0.55 (95 % CI: 0.16, 0.94), 0.59 (95 % CI: 0.32, 0.86), 1.14 (95 % CI: 0.68, 1.59), 1.22 (95 % CI: 0.54, 1.90), and 0.78 (95 % CI: 0.01, 1.55), respectively, while the estimated number 0.19 (95 % CI: −0.02, 0.40) in northwest region was not statistically significant. The concept of ‘avoidable mortality for 1 °C decrease’ was proposed to define the heatwave event, and varied maximum temperature between 28.5 and 31.5 °C was suggested for region-specific heatwave definition in China.",

    "abstract": "Extreme rainfall events are rare in inland arid regions, but have exhibited an increasing trend in recent years, causing many casualties and substantial socioeconomic losses. A series of heavy rains that began on July 31st, 2018, battered the Hami prefecture of eastern Xinjiang, China for four days. These rains sparked devastating floods, caused 20 deaths, eight missing, and the evacuation of about 5500 people. This study examines the extreme rainfall event in a historical context and explores the anthropogenic causes based on analysis of multiple datasets (i.e., the observed daily data, the global climate models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis 1, and the satellite cloud data) and several statistical techniques. Results show that this extraordinarily heavy rainfall was due mainly to the abnormal weather system (e.g., the abnormal subtropical high) that transported abundant water vapor from the Indian Ocean and the East China Sea crossed the high mountains and formed extreme rainfall in Hami prefecture, causing the reservoir to break and form a flood event with treat loss, which is a typical example of a comprehensive analysis of the extreme rainfall event in summer in Northwest China. Also, the fraction of attributable risk (FAR) value was 1.00 when the 2018 July–August RX1day (11.52 mm) was marked as the threshold, supporting the claim of a significant anthropogenic influence on the risk of this extreme rainfall. The results offer insights into the variability of precipitation extremes in arid areas contributing to better manage water-related disasters.",

Although considerable efforts have been provided to examine changes in climatic comfort response to global warming from a partial perspective, the trajectory shift in past and future climatic comfort conditions in China's mainland based on uniform indicators has not been revealed. The spatiotemporal pattern of climatic comfort over historical and future periods was investigated in this study, using China's mainland as an example. The temperature‒humidity index was adopted on the basis of homogenised meteorological station observations and high-resolution climate model simulations to analyse the trends of comfort/discomfort days from 1960 to 2017 and project changes in climatic comfort under representative concentration pathway scenarios in the late 21st century (2071–2100). Results show a substantial decrease in cold-uncomfortable days and a moderate increase in comfortable and warm-uncomfortable days from 1960 to 2017. In the late 21st century, the signals of increasing warm-uncomfortable and decreasing cold-uncomfortable days are projected to enhance significantly while the direction of changes in comfortable days exhibits a north‒south divergence. The uneven changes in warm- and cold-uncomfortable days and an overall decrease in comfortable days in the late 21st century dominate the future trends in climatic comfort in the densely populated southeast half of China. Effective measures taken for adapting to and mitigating global climate warming can considerably avoid the adverse impact of the projected change.",

This study focuses on the estimation of changes in the hydrological regime in the Fuglebekken catchment in SW Spitsbergen (Svalbard). For this purpose, 50 rainfall-runoff models were calibrated using available hydrometeorological observations. The models were validated based on archival flow and SWE observations, and proxy data from time-lapse cameras. Six models (FLEX-IS, GSM-SOCONT, PRMS, HBV, Nordic HBV, and GR4J) with the best performance were applied to reconstruct the past hydrological conditions and analyse the trends in flow regime in the period 1979–2020. Statistically significant changes at 0.05 level in the flow regime indicators were detected, including the number of days with the active flow during the calendar year (10.8 d per decade), during the mid-May‒November period (9.8 d per decade), the date of the first day with the flow (−4.7 d per decade), and the last day with the flow during mid-May‒November (8.4 d per decade). A statistically significant increase in runoff was estimated for two periods from mid-May to the end of June and the second part of August till mid-November. The changes in the first period result from increases in air temperature and earlier snowmelt-driven floods. An estimated runoff increase in the second period corresponds to large increases in rainfall. The increase in air temperature, earlier disappearance of snow, and decrease in precipitation in July and the first part of August result in runoff reduction. The presented results show that the Fuglebekken 'catchment's hydrological regime has already changed. The magnitude of the changes is larger compared to catchments located in lower latitudes.",

Results indicate that 2021-like events would happen extremely rarely without anthropogenic warming (would not occur in counterfactual world simulations) and have become a 1-in-16-year event in the factual world. For the threshold of the second most extreme year, the occurrence probability of extreme WBGT events increases approximately 50 times due to the impact of anthropogenic forcings. The effect of anthropogenic warming under similar atmosphere circulation increases the probability of extreme WBGT events by 13–60 times, and that of corresponding circulation patterns under the same anthropogenic warming increases the probability by 1.3–1.8 times.",

Previous studies examined some aspects of Earth system response to different scenarios of CO2 removal, but lacked a systematic analysis of the carbon cycle and climate system response in a consistent modeling framework. We expanded previous studies by using an Earth system model to examine the response of land and ocean carbon cycle, as well as a set of climate variables to idealized scenarios of atmospheric CO2 removal with different removal rates. In the scenarios considered, atmospheric CO2 increases at a rate of 1% per year to four times of its preindustrial level, and then decreases at a rate of 0.5%, 1%, and 2% per year to the preindustrial level. Simulation results show that a reduction of atmospheric CO2 induces CO2 release from both the ocean and terrestrial biosphere, and to keep atmospheric CO2 at a lower level requires the removal of anthropogenic CO2 not only from the atmosphere, but from the ocean and land carbon reservoirs as well. The response of many variables of the Earth system, including temperature, ocean heat content, sea level, deep ocean acidity, and permafrost area and carbon, lags the decrease in atmospheric CO2 ranging from a few years to many centuries. A few centuries after atmospheric CO2 returns to the preindustrial level, sea level is still substantially higher than the preindustrial level, and permafrost continues losing CO2 to the atmosphere. Our study demonstrates that to offset previous positive CO2 emissions by atmospheric CO2 removal does not mean to offset climate consequence of positive CO2 emissions. Rapid and deep reduction in CO2 emissions is key to prevent and limit increasing risks from further warming. Our study provides new insights into the carbon cycle and climate system response to CO2 removal, which would help to assess future climate change and the associated impacts.",

    "abstract": "Greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions from high-cold terrestrial ecosystems underlain by permafrost on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP) have received widespread attention. However, the dominant factors regulating ecosystem respiration (Re) and its components (soil respiration Rs and heterotrophic respiration Rh) and how the differences in carbon emissions from different ecotypes and seasons remain are still unclear. We conducted a 2-year field investigation (August 2018 to October 2020) and applied the structural equation model (SEM) to clarify the changes in the factors controlling the respiration components during different seasons. The results indicate that the Re and its controlling factors in three alpine grassland ecosystems (alpine steppe, alpine meadow, and swamp meadow) vary with seasons. Furthermore, autotrophic respiration (Ra) contributes the most to the seasonal changes in Re. The Re gradually increases in the early growing season and rapidly decreases in the late growing season. Rh remains relatively stable during the year. Under these seasonal variations in the respiration components, the dominant factors controlling Re in the nongrowing season are the temperature of the atmosphere–soil interface (heat flux, atmospheric temperature, and soil temperature at 5 cm depth) and microbial activity (microbial carbon and pH) with the variable importance projections >1.5. During the growing season, the dominant factors regulating Re, Rs, and Rh are the soil temperature with a standardized direct effect (SDE) of 0.424, soil nutrient conditions (total nitrogen and pH) with SDEs of 0.570–0.614, and microbial activity (microbial carbon) with a SDE of 0.591, respectively. In addition, meteorological conditions have an important impact on the respiration components during the growing season. Specifically, the atmospheric vapor pressure is the dominant factor regulating the three respiration components (standardized total effects = 0.44−0.53, p < 0.001). The optimal soil water contents during the growing season (water content at which Re reaches the maximum) are 10% in the alpine steppe, 13%–15% in the alpine meadow, and 40%–43% in the swamp meadow, respectively. The effect of the soil water content on Re is more important in arid ecosystems (alpine steppe and alpine meadow) than in wet ecosystem (swamp meadow). The alleviation of water limitations in arid ecosystems may potentially increase Re.",

However, these investigations still fail to characterise the future changes in HWs regionally over China. PRECIS dynamical downscaling with a horizontal resolution of 25 km × 25 km was employed on the basis of GCM-HadCM3 to provide reliable projections on HWs over the Chinese mainland, and six statistical downscaling methods were used for bias correction under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The multi-method ensemble (MME) of the top three dynamical downscaling methods with good performance was used to project future changes. Results showed that PRECIS primarily replicated the detailed spatiotemporal pattern of HWs. However, PRECIS overestimated the HWs in the Northwest and Southeast and expanded the areas of HWs in the Northeast and Southwest. Three statistical downscaling methods (quantile mapping, CDF-t and quantile delta mapping) demonstrated good performance in improving PRECIS simulation for reproducing HWs. By contrast, parametric-based trend-preserving approaches such as scaled distribution mapping and ISI-MIP are outperformed by the three aforementioned methods in downscaling HWs, particularly in the high latitudes of China. Based on MME projections, at the end of the 21st century, the national average of the number of HW days each year, the length of the longest HW event in the year and the extreme maximum temperature in HW will increase by 3 times, 1 time and 1.3 °C, respectively, under the RCP4.5 scenario, whilst that under the RCP8.5 scenario will increase by 8 times, 3 times and 3.7 °C, respectively, relative to 1986–2005. The Northwest is regionally projected to suffer long and hot HWs, whilst the South and Southeast will experience frequent consecutive HWs. Thus, HWs projected by the combined dynamical and statistical downscaling method are highly reliable in projecting HWs over China.",

Most studies have projected SWS changes in the 21st century over China on the basis of the multi-model ensemble (MME) of the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). However, the simulation capability for SWS varies greatly in CMIP6 multi-models, so the MME results still have large uncertainties. In this study, we used the reliability ensemble averaging (REA) method to assign each model different weights according to their performances in simulating historical SWS changes and project the SWS under different shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) in 2015‒2099. The results indicate that REA considerably improves the SWS simulation capacity of CMIP6, eliminating the overestimation of SWS by the MME and increasing the simulation capacity of spatial distribution. The spatial correlations with observations increased from 0.56 for the MME to 0.85 for REA. Generally, REA could eliminate the overestimation of the SWS by 33% in 2015‒2099. Except for southeastern China, the SWS generally decreases over China in the near term (2020‒2049) and later term (2070–2099), particularly under high-emission scenarios. The SWS reduction projected by REA is twice as high as that by the MME in the near term, reaching −4% to −3%. REA predicts a larger area of increased SWS in the later term, which expands from southeastern China to eastern China. This study helps to reduce the projected SWS uncertainties.",

    "abstract": "Developing a localized and consistent model framework for climate loss and damage assessment is crucial for the policy-making of climate change mitigation and adaptation. This study introduces a comprehensive, multidisciplinary Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) framework for evaluating climate damage in China, utilizing BCC-SESM climate model and FUND sectoral climate damage model under the SSP2-RCPs scenario. Employing a bottom-up approach, the research estimates climate damage across eight major sectors, recalibrates sectoral climate damage functions and parameters for China, and elucidates distinctions among direct climate loss, market climate loss, and aggregate climate loss. The findings reveal that the total climate damage function for China follows a quadratic pattern in response to temperature rise. By 2050, the estimated climate damage is projected to be 5.4%, 5.7%, and 8.2% of GDP under RCP 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5, respectively. Additionally, both direct and market climate losses are projected to remain below 2% of GDP by 2050, while the aggregate climate loss could reach as high as 8.2%, which is predominantly attributed to non-market sectors. From a sectoral perspective, under the RCP8.5 scenario, human health damage constitutes the largest share (61.9%) of the total climate loss by 2050, followed by sea-level rise damage (18.6%). This study sheds lights on the adaptation policy that should attach importance to the non-market sectors, particularly focusing on human health and sea-level rise.",

This work provides a systematic quantitative assessment of the deceleration status of glaciers in this region by investigating the motion evolution of typical glaciers in Mount Gongga in recent years, thereby revealing the seasonal dynamics and inter-annual evolution over an extensive time span. We used the optical flow-small baseline subset (OF-SBAS) method to compute the time-series velocities of the Hailuogou Glacier and the Mozigou Glacier using 178 archived Sentinel-1 satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from 2014 to 2021. The findings revealed a prominent seasonal pattern in glacier motion, characterised by cyclic variations in velocity from cold to warm seasons. Moreover, we identified variations in velocities across distinct regions of the glacier surface, underscored by the lag in the peak time node of glacier flow with increasing elevation. This pattern may have been determined by a combination of internal and external factors, including mass accumulation and ablation-driven subglacial drainage, as well as the glacier geomorphological setting. Furthermore, during 2015‒2021, the glaciers on the eastern slope of Mount Gongga exhibited an overarching trend of deceleration. Notably, the ablation area of the Hailuogou Glacier recorded the most substantial deceleration, exceeding 8% per year. This study underscores the efficacy of the OF-SBAS method in extracting long-term glacier velocities. This work also establishes a robust foundation for the analysis of spatiotemporal fluctuations in glacier movement within the context of climate warming.",

In the last two decades, China has experienced both rapid economic development and environmental warming; however, the spatiotemporal variations of association between environmental heat and labor loss have been rarely investigated behind this double impact. Here, we evaluated the variation in China's heat-induced labor productivity loss and related economic cost from 2001–2019 and investigated the effect of economic development and regional warming. We found that decline in labor productivity because of heat stress increased significantly (p < 0.05 for heavy-intensity work), and the corresponding economic loss also exhibited a drastic increase by 6- to 9-fold. The relative economic loss showed a slight but nonsignificant increase with an average value of 0.54% of the annual total earnings. At the sub-regional and sectoral level, adverse effects were more prominent in the southeast region, and the secondary industry sectors, such as construction and manufacturing, contributed to larger proportions of economic losses. The transformation of industrial structure made economic sectors more vulnerable to heat exposure, and increasingly preventive effects of air-conditioning use were noted on economic damage due to heat-induced productivity decline (36.0% relative economic benefits in 2019 compared to 9.7% in 2001). Our findings could provide a deep insight into heat burden on occupational health and heat adaptation strategies regionally under climate change, especially in developing areas with higher temperature and humidity environment.",

By applying the probability distribution and extreme value theory to the projected daily precipitation (2011–2050) under SRES A1B scenario with CCLM, trends of daily precipitation series and daily precipitation extremes are analyzed. Results show that except for the western Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and South China, distribution patterns of the kurtosis and skewness calculated from the simulated and observed series are consistent with each other; their spatial correlation coefficients are above 0.75. The CCLM can well capture the distribution characteristics of daily precipitation over China. It is projected that in some parts of the Jianghuai region, central-eastern Northeast China and Inner Mongolia, the kurtosis and skewness will increase significantly, and precipitation extremes will increase during 2011–2050. The projected increase of maximum daily rainfall and longest non-precipitation period during flood season in the aforementioned regions, also show increasing trends of droughts and floods in the next 40 years.

    "abstract": "The spatial and temporal variations of some important near-surface climate parameters and extreme climate events in North China during 1961–2010 are analyzed by using 94 meteorological stations’ data in the study area. Results show that the annual mean surface air temperature in North China increased at the rate of 0.36°C per decade, higher than the national average in the same period. Increasing was particularly significant since the mid-1980s, with maximum increase in the middle and northeastern parts of Inner Mongolia. Increasing rate of the annual mean minimum temperature is much higher than that of the maximum temperature, which results in the decrease of the annual mean diurnal temperature range. Noticeable decrease is also observed in the frequency of cold wave. Annual precipitation shows a slight decreasing trend, with more pronounced decrease in southern Shanxi and eastern Hebei provinces, which is mainly represented as decreasing in contribution rates of rainstorm and heavy storm in flood-season (May to September). During 1961–2010, North China is characterized by a noticeable reduction in annual extreme precipitation, and an increase in high-temperature days over most parts, as well as more frequent droughts. There are remarkable reductions in annual sunshine duration and mean wind speed, associated with the most significant reduction of mean wind speed in midwestern and eastern parts of Inner Mongolia. Meanwhile, North China has experienced a noticeable decrease/increase in annual mean sanddust/haze days during the study period. However, there is no significant trend in fog days, except a pronounced decrease since the 1990s. Guo, W.-L., H.-B. Shi, J.-J.

    "abstract": "The impacts of urban heat island effect on climate change in China and the world have been mostly conducted with meteorological station data for about last 50 years. Both the urban heat island effect and its contribution to climate warming have been calculated. For the quantification of urban heat island effect, one method is that observation stations are divided into degrees in accordance with city population, corresponding to the calculated population changes in different periods. Another method is that differences between the temperature at urban station and rural (countryside) station (or nearby sea surface temperature, SST). A recent study based on remote sensing data shows that heat island effect of the global mean daily temperature is 2.6◦C in summer, and 1.4◦C in winter [Zhang et al., 2010]. Research on China [Zhao, 1991; Ren et al., 2008; Jones et al., 2008] indicates that urban heat island effect contributes to climate warming by about 30%. Table 1 summarizes the contribution of urbanization to the warming for some studies in China [Zhao, 2011]. Because many gauge stations in China are located in urban regions, they are influenced by urbanization processes more clearly than before. Urban heat island effect is strengthening climate warming. Early research found that the mean warming was 0.06◦C per decade in China for 1951– 1989, in which urbanization caused the mean warming of 0.05◦C per decade and accounted for 83% of the total warming [Zhao, 1991]. It means that the key warming action was from urban heat island effect during 1950s–1980s. Recent study indicates that temperature increasing was obvious in China for 1961– 2004, the mean warming was 0.06–0.09◦C per decade up to 0.10◦C per decade in some significant areas. The annual mean warming rate due to urban heat island effect was 27%, and 18%–38% for the four seasons. It means that urban heat island effect contributed to 1/5–1/3 of the total warming in China in the last 50 years. Warming due to urban heat island effect in China was significant [Ren et al., 2008]. A new investigation estimated urban heat island effect in comparison with the nearby SST which was not influenced by urbanization. The warming trend in China for 1951– 2004 was 0.22◦C per decade. At the same time, the warming trend of SST was 0.14◦C per decade. Urban heat island effect caused warming of 0.08◦C per decade, which was 36% of the total warming. Urban heat island effect in China was more obvious than before due to urban population increase, urban areas",

It was found that temperatures in most of the region were warming and this was especially evident for areas at high elevation. The warming was mostly attributable to the increase in annual mean minimum temperature. The characteristics of high temperature/heat waves are increase in frequency, prolonged duration, and weakened intensity. Annual precipitation showed a weak decreasing trend and drier in the east and more rainfall in the west. The precipitation amount in flood season was declining markedly in the whole region; rainfall from extreme heavy precipitation did not change much, and the portion of annual precipitation contributed by extreme heavy precipitation had an increasing trend; annual non-rainy days and the longest consecutive non-rainy days were both increasing; the extreme drought had a decreasing trend since the 1990s; the autumn-rain days displayed a downward fluctuation with apparent periodicity and intermittency.

    "abstract": "In recent years, intensifying waterlogging, salt water intrusion, wetland loss, and ecosystem degradation in Chinese delta cities and adjacent regions have generated the pressing need to create an urban form that is suited to both current and future climates incorporating sea level rise. However, adaptation planning uptake is slow. This is particularly unfortunate because patterns of urban form interact with mean sea level rise (MSLR) in ways that reduce or intensify its impact. There are currently two main barriers that are significant in arresting the implementation of adaptation planning with reference to the MSLR projections composed of geomorphologic MSLR projections and eustatic MSLR projections from global climate warming, and making a comprehensive risk assessment of MSLR projections. The present review shows recent progresses in mapping MSLR projections and their risk assessment approaches on Chinese delta cities, and then a perspective of adapting these cities to MSLR projections as following six aspects. 1) The geomorphologic MSLR projections are contributed by the natural tectonic subsidence projections and the MSLR projections by anthropogenic geomorphologic change. The former needs to be updated in a global framework. The latter is accumulated by land subsidence from underground water depletion, water level fall caused by the erosion of riverbeds from a sediment supply decline attributed to the construction of watershed dams, artificial sand excavation, water level raise by engineering projects including land reclamation, deep waterway regulation, and fresh water reservoirs. 2) Controlling MSLR projections by anthropogenic geomorphologic changes. 3) The IPCC AR5 RCPs MSLRs scenarios are expected to be projected to the local eustatic MSLR projections on the Chinese deltas. 4) The MSLR projections need to be matched to a local elevation datum. 5) Modeling approaches of regional river-sea numerical with semi-analytical hydrodynamics, estuarine channel network, system dynamics and adaptation points are perspective. 6) Adaptation planning to MSLR projections requires a comprehensive risk assessment of the risk of flood, fresh water supply shortage, coastal erosion, wetland loss, siltation of ports and waterway in Chinese delta cities and adjacent regions.",

    "abstract": "This study reviewed the status of PM2.5 and tropospheric O3 observations in China (15–55°N, 72–136°E). Initially, the distribution of tropospheric O3 over the globe and China was determined based on satellite observations made during 2010–2013. The annual mean values were 29.78 DU and 33.97 DU over the globe and China, respectively. The distribution of PM2.5 and seasonal changes in concentrations in China were then simulated using an aerosol chemistry–climate coupled model system, with an annual mean value of 0.51 × 10−8 kg m−3. The contributions from five different aerosols to the simulated PM2.5 concentrations in different seasons were also determined. The relationships among the emissions of aerosols, greenhouse gases and their precursors and radiative forcings were determined with reference to the (IPCC AR5) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change the Fifth Assessment Report. From these relationships, the possible effects of controlling O3 precursors and (PM) particulate matter on the climate were considered. The influence of the control of O3 precursors was not totally clear, and reducing emissions of short-lived greenhouse gases and black carbon was considered a secondary measure for short-term (the next 50 years) climate-change mitigation. Reducing emissions of CO2 is still the best strategy for meeting the target of a global average rise in surface air temperature of less than 2 °C. Near- and short-term emission reduction strategies are important for both effective environmental protection and climate-change mitigation.",

The number of days with temperatures steadily above 0°C and 10°C (two criteria) have increased during 1960–2010. The area suitable for multiple cropping has increased; the growth period has shortened; the climatic potential productivity has declined; the pest damage has worsened. During 1961–2010, the desired cooling degree days in Southwest China has increased 38.9°C d per decade. Forest fires and pests have increased. The area of meadow and wetlands has decreased. Heterogeneous invasion has intensified; endangered animal and plant species have increased. The tourism landscape has been damaged. The risk of human health has increased. In the 21st century, with the increase of temperature and precipitation, the number of days with temperature steadily above 10°C and the accumulated temperature will continue to increase, most notably in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The area of intercropping will expand; multiple cropping will move to higher altitudes. The impacts of agrometeorological disasters, pests and diseases will intensify. The summer cooling energy consumption continues to increase; energy supply will show larger variability; the gap between energy supply and demand will be widened. The phenology will keep on changing, and the habitat will be worsening. Biological population will move northward and to higher altitudes. Some species are at risk of extinction.

Examining the case of Xi'an, this paper aims to explore the spatial distribution of commuting CO2 emissions and influencing factors in the new, urban industry zones and city centers considering Xi'an's transition from a monocentric to a polycentric city in the process of urbanization. Based on household survey data from 1501 respondents, there are obvious differences in commuting CO2 emissions between new industry zones and city centers: City centers feature lower household emissions of 2.86 kg CO2 per week, whereas new industry zones generally have higher household emissions of 3.20 kg CO2 per week. Contrary to previous research results, not all new industry zones have high levels of CO2 emissions; with the rapid development of various types of industries, even a minimum level of household emissions of 2.53 kg CO2 per week is possible. The uneven distribution of commuting CO2 emissions is not uniformly affected by spatial parameters such as job–housing balance, residential density, employment density, and land use diversity. Optimum combination of the spatial parameters and travel pattern along with corresponding transport infrastructure construction may be an appropriate path to reduction and control of emissions from commuting.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is a threat to the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in sub-Saharan Africa as its impacts can lead to increased incidences of poverty and inequality which can subsequently lead to a 12% decline in the Human Development Index (HDI) for sub-Saharan Africa. Emerging countries such as China have the potential to support Africa to achieve the SDGs by pioneering South–South Climate Finance (SSCF) modalities. In order to increase knowledge on climate informed development and the role of China in global climate governance, the paper examined various research articles, case studies, policy briefs and project reports. Sino-African aid, investments and trade were noted as essential in mitigating Africa's climate change vulnerabilities which induce poverty traps and inequality. Some African countries were noted to have a comparative advantage in environmental standards over China but lacked the initiative to use this comparative advantage to enhance the Forum on China–Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) and assist China to have a sustainable growth trajectory. The paper concludes that SSCF modalities can enhance climate risk management in Africa if they focus on improving financial inclusion and improving climate finance flows towards climate change adaptation activities in Africa. Additionally, to increase the effectiveness and impact of Chinese climate finance support to Africa, African policymakers should not allow political and market forces to decide how climate related support from China should be allocated as decisions based on political and market forces could potentially promote an inequitable distribution of funds and ignore the most vulnerable countries and regions.",

It is feasible for China to realize an emission pathway that is consistent with this target; however, we need to understand the roadmap to do so. In this paper, the results of a modeling study by the Integrated Policy Assessment Model for China (IPAC) concerning the investment required to realize the 2 °C scenario by examining the penetration of low-carbon technologies including energy supply and energy efficiency improvement in end-use sectors is presented. It is found that the investment required in the energy supply sector to realize the 2 °C scenario could reach CN¥1.2 trillion by 2020, CN¥1.0 trillion by 2030, and CN¥1.4 trillion by 2050. The investment needed for energy saving could reach CN¥1.6 trillion by 2020, CN¥1.8 trillion by 2030, and CN¥1.5 trillion by 2050, which represents the additional investment as compared with the use of old technologies. If the investment required both in the energy supply sector and in energy saving in end-use sectors is considered, the total investment is estimated to be CN¥2.8 trillion by 2020, CN¥2.8 trillion by 2030, and CN¥2.9 trillion by 2050. These investments account for 2.5% of China's total GDP in 2020, 1.3% in 2030, and 0.6% by 2050, which represents quite a small investment percentage to realize the goal of low-carbon development.",

This study uses the instrumental recorded meteorological data along the altitude from 3600 to 4400 m at every 200 m in the growing season, investigates the smith fir growth biomass from 2006 to 2010 in the same timberline ecotone, and makes a non-linear regression analysis to determine the relationship between the alpine tree growth biomass and its in-situ environment condition. The results showed that the cool and warm slope share different air temperature lapse rates, which were −0.48 °C (100 m)−1 in the warm slope and −0.54 °C (100 m)−1 in the cool slope, respectively. However, the dominant timberline tree species in the warm slope was Sabina saltuaria, and it can reach as high as 4570 m, which is approximately 170 m higher than that in the cool slope. Moreover, the smith fir in the cool slope was only distributed in the range of elevation from approximately 3600 to 4400 m. The altitude of approximately 3800 m was the appropriate altitude for the growing smith fir, where the mean air temperature in the growing season was about 9.0 °C, and the young smith fir tree can form more biomass. The results suggested that alpine forest chose a suitable environment where trees can grow more in the prolonged succession, but not in the warmer or cooler condition, it could be seen as a biological evidence for climate change.",

    "abstract": "Recent and historic high-impact events have demonstrated significant flood risks to many coastal areas in Europe and across the globe. Understanding the behavior of humans in relation to risk management poses grand challenges for both natural and social sciences and humanities. The study analyzes the cultural aspects of coastal risk management and illustrates path-dependencies of concrete disaster risk reduction measures in relation to local contexts in European coastal regions in Northern and South Western Europe. It adopts a comparative approach by targeting risk perception and risk management related to coastal floods and erosion, induced by storms and sea level rise, in two contrasting coastal areas: German coastal state Schleswig–Holstein at the Baltic Sea (especially the communities Eckernförde and Timmendorfer Strand) and the Portuguese barrier island system of Ria Formosa (especially the community of Faro Beach). Both regions are very low lying with only a few meters above sea level and exposed to similar hazards such as erosion and floods induced by coastal storms, and while they are both attractive touristic destinations, they are culturally, socio-economically and politically very different. The geographical and the socio-cultural contexts of the case study regions are assessed first using an explorative approach, followed by an analysis of the relevance of cultural aspects for the implementation of disaster risk reduction measures. The study addresses both first responders (city authorities, citizens) and scholars. It is found that the choice of risk reduction measures hinges on the values underlying people's perspectives about the desired outcomes of specific measures and that the role of identity and meaning making are still undervalued in decision making processes. It concludes that subjective capacities formed by cultural identities, knowledge, trust coupled with a variety of factors of socio-economic and political texture are important to understand local decision making processes. The authors found that lively 'culture of risk memory', 'trust in scientific information and community' as well as decision making of coastal authorities coupled with inclusiveness and participation of communities in formulating and implementing disaster risk reduction measures are prerequisites for successful collaboration and in turn execution of disaster risk reduction measures.",

This study aims to establish the link between the willingness to carry out protective behaviors and physical and perceived indicators of vulnerability. A typology of coastal flooding vulnerability, uses various physical indicators and their perceived counterparts which have been collected from 490 inhabitants of Cartagena (Colombia, declared world heritage of humanity by UNESCO in 1984), resident in areas of coastal flooding risks. The item-response theory (IRT) approach has been used. The results reveal that the implementation of protective behaviors is more related to perceived indicators, such as distance to the sea, than to actual physical vulnerability. We observe that physical vulnerability is linked to the intention to carry out protective behaviors. The presence of a defensive structure against coastal flooding could be considered as a visual cue and be a good predictor of the willingness to carry out protective behaviors. On the contrary, people in the most vulnerable situation (single-storey house) do not demonstrate a higher level of willingness to carry out protective behavior, as well of participants who lived in residential buildings which have demonstrated lower level of willingness to carry out such behaviors. Therefore, vulnerability of the house is not seen as a criterion that encourages participants to better protect themselves.",

However, we find that a carbon tax may actually hurt the environment based on a stylized game model with a better-informed retailer (one who controls the demand information sharing with the manufacturer) and a manufacturer. In particular, we find that the carbon emissions reduction may harm the environment if the carbon tax is moderate or both the carbon tax and the demand fluctuation are high. We further reveal free-riding behavior by the retailer, who may enjoy more profit sharing from the supply chain in the presence of carbon emissions reduction. Based on these observations, we argue that a carbon tax does not always benefit the environment when a manufacturer who receives demand information from the retailer responds better to market uncertainty.",

Compared with the modern climate (1985–2014), the projected surface air temperature (SAT) change is characterized by a robust 'Northern Hemisphere (NH)-warmer than-Southern Hemisphere (SH)' and 'land-warmer than-ocean' patterns. The projected precipitation change exhibits 'NH-wetter than-SH' pattern in the tropics. Although the response of SAT and precipitation climatology show similar pattern between stabilized and overshoot scenarios, some significant differences are still found. The projected change in the Northern Hemisphere land monsoon precipitation (NHLMP) is 30% larger in the transient 2 °C experiment compared with that in the stabilized 2 °C experiment. The more vigorous NHLMP in the transient global warming scenario is mainly due to the enhanced land–sea thermal contrast and interhemispheric temperature difference. The enlarged land–sea thermal contrast increases the surface pressure gradient between the NH continents and its adjacent oceans, thus enhancing the NH monsoon circulation and moisture convergence. The enhanced interhemispheric temperature difference shifts the Hadley circulation and intertropical convergence zone northward, leading to the enhanced moisture convergence and the shifts of tropical rain band over the NH monsoon region. This result highlights that climate responses may depend on different warming trajectories and, which could facilitate the strategic planning of governments.",

    "abstract": "Atmospheric compositions and acid rain are closely related to atmospheric environment, weather, and climate change. In this study, the concentration levels and long-term trends of CO2, CH4, O3, PM2.5, PM10, and acid rain were presented at the Mt. Waliguan global baseline station in Qinghai, Shangdianzi and Lin'an regional background stations in the North China Plain (NCP) and the Yangtze River Delta region (YRD) of China based on the data observed until 2018. Significant increasing trends of CO2 were found at all of these stations. At Mt. Waliguan, the concentration levels and growth rate were consistent with the average values in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and those observed at the Mauna Loa station in Hawaii. The CH4 also showed a upward tendency similar to that observed in NH. Compared with the observations at Mt. Waliguan global baseline station, the CO2 and CH4 mole fractions were higher at Shangdianzi and Lin'an regional background stations, indicating the important contributions of anthropogenic activities to the regional background level of CO2 and CH4. The annual averaged surface ozone showed increasing trends at Mt. Waliguan and Shangdianzi stations, whereas no clear trend was found at Lin'an station. Similar variations in the patterns of aerosol concentrations at Shangdianzi and Lin'an were found according to the PM2.5 or PM10 observations. Overall, the aerosol concentrations at both stations shown declining trends since the observations. However, two periods of high particle concentrations occurred in 2006–2007 and 2013–2014. The annual mean aerosol concentrations have continuously decreased after 2013–2014, indicating the effectiveness of pollution control in the NCP and YRD, especially since the implementation of the 'Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Air Pollution' in September 2013. Comparative analysis of aerosol with acid rain showed that the period with high concentrations of aerosols in the early years was consistent with that of severe acid rain pollution, suggesting that both aerosol pollution and severe acid rain are closely related to coal combustion emissions in China. As a result of the control of coal combustion emissions for acid and SO2, NOx emissions have contributed more substantially to aerosols due to the rapid growth of vehicle ownership. A comparison of the trends of aerosols with the maximum daily 8-h average of surface ozone (MDA8) at Shangdianzi and Lin'an stations revealed the complicated relationship between aerosol reduction and ozone production, i.e., together with the continuous improvement of particulate pollution in the NCP and YRD, the MDA8 at both stations showed a decreasing trend at first but subsequently increased after 2014 with aerosols remaining reduced. Such different variation patterns of the MDA8 with PM2.5 (or PM10) indicated the high challenge of synergic control of aerosol and ozone pollution in China.",

To clarify the research status of climate change in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) regions, the BRI countries can better deal with climate change. This study aims to improve our understanding of the status and trends of research on climate change in the BRI regions. Based on keywords associated with the BRI and climate change, we undertake bibliometric research by collecting 21,225 related SCI/SSCI articles published during 2013–2018. Statistics and analysis revealed the topics and hotspots of research on BRI and climate change. Following findings are distilled. First, although the number of published articles exhibited a rapidly growing trend, their distribution is extremely uneven. Articles were mainly published by institutions from USA, UK, China, India, and Germany, while individual contributions from most BRI countries was less than 1% of the publication volume. Second, existing studies focused on climate change impacts on BRI countries, in addition, climate mitigation and adaptation in BRI regions, especially the assessment of climate change risks and measures and policies in response to climate change, was less watched in the research. Third, not all BRI regions have been examined by researchers. South Africa, South Asia, and West Asia and North Africa are hotspots, while the Pacific and Central Asia are largely neglected. In the future, BRI countries need to improve their research ability on climate change and more attention should be paid to the field of climate mitigation, especially on the assessment of climate change risks, measures, and policies, and BRI countries in the Oceania and Central Asia regions.",

Because the stable supply of agricultural resources provides a solid basis for efficient bioenergy production, the climate-induced impacts such as changes in temperature and precipitation that potentially alter the farming decisions and cropping patterns should be taken into account. This study designs two-stage stochastic programming with recourse model to investigate the net bioenergy production and emission reduction, as well as the bioenergy producers' strategies under various market operations and climate scenarios. The results show that the net production of biopower and biofuel are relatively stable because the supply of bioenergy feedstocks could remain at a constant level, but the farming decisions, cropping pattern, and resource utilization are likely to be altered by climate-induced impacts. The results also indicate that for efficient bioenergy production, approximately 41.5 billion TWD (9.65 billion CNY) and 33.6 billion TWD (7.81 billion CNY) of bond principal should be invested in crop-based and residual-based technology, respectively. In the face of strict environmental regulations and emission management, biopower technology becomes more competitive, and under such a circumstance, more than 98.3% of the low-cost bond should be invested in biopower development to achieve development efficiency.",

The stability of cast-in-place pile foundations is highly sensitive to permafrost thermal regime changes. Permafrost degradation caused by climate change is increasing the disaster risk of cast-in-place pile foundations. However, proactive cooling methods for cast-in-place pile foundations are seldom reported. The cold energy produced by two-phase closed thermosyphons (TPCTs) can efficiently prevent the permafrost thermal regime from being disturbed by engineering activities and climate change. TPCTs were installed in a concrete pile forming a thermal pile. Then, a model experiment was conducted to explore the thermal regime, influence scope, dissipation process of cold energy, and freezing strength of the thermal pile. The results indicated that the thermal pile may significantly cool the foundation soil. Most of cold energy produced by the thermal pile dissipated during the warm period, and the cooling scope of the thermal pile can cover the area within a 40 cm (twice the pile diameter) radius around the pile. Additionally, the TPCTs can significantly improve freezing strength between the thermal pile and frozen soil. The lesson learned from this study can provide a new approach to control the thermal regime of cast-in-place pile foundation in permafrost, which was of valuable to the construction of pile foundations in cold regions.",

    "abstract": "In Poland the phase in which precipitation occurs impacts the availability of water in its reservoirs, the potential for hydrological droughts, snowfall flooding and winter recreation. The influence of warming on the occurrence of precipitation phases on the Polish scale has not been studied so far. Based on data from 42 synoptic stations for the period 1966–2020, this study discusses trends in the indices of liquid (Lq), mixed (Mx) and solid (Sd) precipitation describing their totals (T), frequencies (Nd) and contribution to overall precipitation totals (T%) and a number of days with overall precipitation (Nd%) from a seasonal perspective. Moreover, the influence of seasonal and daily air temperatures on long-term variability in the precipitation phase indices was assessed. The precipitation phase was discriminated based on the observations of weather phenomena noted as current and past weather considering days with precipitation ≥ 0.1 mm. Precipitation phases significantly reacted to current warming. The strongest and widespread were increasing trends in rains (+1.74 for LqNd, +5.35 mm for LqT, +3.51% for LqNd%, +4.08% for LqT% per decade) and decreasing trends in snowfalls (−1.92 for SdNd, −3.12 mm for SdT, −3.65% for SdNd%, −3.26% for SdT% per decade) in winter when the warming was weakest but average temperature was close to freezing point. In winter, air temperature explained 60%–80% of the variance in the frequency of snowfall and rainfall. Daily air temperature > –2 °C contributed to trends in winter rainfall while daily air temperature > 1 °C most contributed to trends in winter snowfall. No trends in winter mixed precipitation were due to opposite changes in its frequency above and below 1 °C. In spring, the increase in a liquid phase was due more to the melting of a solid and mixed phase, while in autumn, it was due more to the transformation of a mixed phase into a liquid phase. In spring, air temperature explained at most 30%–50% of the variance in the indices of snowfall frequency. Negative trends in mixed precipitation were significant in transitional seasons, being more prominent in spring than in autumn and were mostly driven by changes in daily air temperatures between 0 and 5 °C. A diminished percentage of summer rains on days with air temperatures below 15 °C was compensated by their increase above that threshold thus producing no long-term trends. Warming significantly weakened the relationships between precipitation phases and average seasonal air temperatures except for summer rainfalls.",

To better understand the freezing–thawing processes of the active layer and its driving factors, according to the observation from 2017 to 2020 of soil temperature and water content in the active layer of forest and peatland in two representative hemiboreal ecosystems in the Da Xing'anling Mountains, Northeast China, the study explored in detail the effects of climatic conditions and local factors on the hydrothermal and freezing–thawing processes of active layer soils. The results showed that during the freezing–thawing cycles of 2017–2020, freezing and thawing start times in the peatland and forest ecosystems soils were generally delayed, and it took longer for the active layer soil to completely thaw than to freeze. The annual average soil temperature in the peatland's active layer (5–80 cm) was 0.7–2.0 °C lower than that in the forest, and the annual average soil moisture content on the peatland was 5.5%–26.7% higher than that in the forest. Compared with the forest ecosystem soils, the ground surface freezing time of the peatland was delayed by 3–10 d, and the freezing rate decreased by 1.1–1.5 cm d−1, while the beginning time of thawing was advanced by 22–27 d, and the thawing rate decreased by 1.3–1.4 cm d−1. In the process of decreasing soil temperature and increasing soil moisture content, the freezing and thawing rate of the active layer would be reduced, decelerating the freezing–thawing processes of the active layer in the process of decreasing soil temperature and increasing soil moisture content. The results provide the key original data for studying the formation and evolution of active layer and permafrost in the Xing'an permafrost regions in Northeast China and can be used to validate the prediction of ecosystem succession under the combined influences of climate change and permafrost degradation.",

The safety and stability of buildings are closely related to the temperature of permafrost. However, there are limitations of understanding on this method in the high-altitude, warm (>−1 °C) permafrost areas on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau. In this study, the thermal stability of permafrost foundation soils under buildings with an underfloor open ventilation space and pile foundations in warm permafrost at high altitudes was studied through field observations of ground and air temperatures, wind speed, net radiation from 2017 to 2021. The results indicated that the open ventilation space exerted an effective cooling effect on the underlying permafrost and pile foundations from March to October, while a thermal insulation effect was observed from November to February of the following year, but overall, the cooling effect dominated; the cooling effect of open ventilation spaces differed spatially. The permafrost temperature on the south-facing side was higher than that on the north-facing side, and those on the east and west sides were higher than that directly under the open ventilation space of the building. This study also demonstrated that radiation shielded by the building was a main factor of the cooling effect of open ventilation spaces, and the cooling effect of open ventilation spaces could accelerate the back-freezing of the cast-in-place (CIP) pile foundations. This structure could effectively maintain the frozen state of the underlying warm permafrost at high elevations on the interior Qinghai–Tibet Plateau.",

In comparison with scientific observation results of climate and cryosphere change, this paper analyzes the possible impact of the change on water resources and agriculture production in the area. Perceptions of most respondents on climate and cryosphere changes confirm the main objective facts. For the selection of adaptation measures addressing the shortage of water resource, the results are as follows: most people preferred to choose the measures like \"policy change\" and \"basic facility construction\" which are mostly implemented by the government and the policy-making department; some people showed more preference to the measures of avoiding unfavorable natural environment, such as finding job in or migrating to other places. The urgency of personal participation in the adaptation measures is still inadequate. Some adaptation measures should be implemented in line with local conditions and require the organic combination of \"resource-development\" with \"water-saving\". Deng, M., H. Zhang, W.

The speed has been particularly rapid in 1980–2015 at a rate of 4.7 mm per year. 2) Astronomical tides showed a clear long-term trend in 1950–2015.

The mean high and low tides increased at a rate of 0.08 and 0.52 cm per year, respectively, whereas the mean tidal range decreased at a rate of 0.44 cm per year. Results from numerical experiments show that local sea level rise plays an important role in the tidal dynamics change in Bohai Bay. 3) It is considered that the sea level return periods will decrease owing to the influence of sea level rise and land subsidence, therefore design tide level will change in relation to sea level rise. Therefore, the ability of seawalls to withstand water will diminish, and storm surge disasters will become more serious in the future.",

Climate changes over China during the 21st century under the RCP4.5 scenario from CSIRO-Mk3.6.0 and RegCM4.4 are analyzed. Both simulations project that continuous warming with large regional variations will occur in the future. The two simulations obtain similar inter-annual fluctuations of regional average warming, with RegCM4.4 obtaining somewhat smaller values than CSIRO-Mk3.6.0. Projected precipitation changes are even more regionally variable than temperature changes. In western China, both models project increased precipitation, while the projections from two models show different regional details in eastern China. In both simulations, projected annual mean precipitation on a national scale does not change significantly due to the contrast changes between dry and wet seasons. To analyze uncertainties of the projected climate change in China, the simulation of RegCM4.4 is compared with a previous simulation of the RegCM3 at the same horizontal resolution. The overall consistency in precipitation change between RegCM3 and RegCM4.4 is projected across western China, while inconsistency is identified in most of eastern China.",

When rainfall, snowfall, or accumulated snow weather phenomena occur, critical values are determined based on daily air temperature and precipitation for current climate conditions. Air temperature of 0°C is defined as the critical value of temperature for rainfall or snowfall, while 0°C air temperature and 4.0 mm (autumn) or 3.0 mm (spring) snowfall amounts are defined as the critical values for accumulated snowfall. Analyses based on the above critical values disclose that under current climate condition, stations with \"at-risk\" accumulated snow account for 33% and 36% of all stations, and the \"at-risk\" snowfall stations reach 78% and 81% in autumn and spring, respectively. Spatially, most stations with \"at-risk\" accumulated snow are located on the southern and eastern edge of the QTP, and stations with \"at-risk\" snowfall are also apparent at the northern edge. If the air temperature increases by 2.5°C in 2050, only the snowfall at a few \"at-risk\" snowfall stations will transform into rainfall, while most \"at-risk\" accumulated snow stations will face the problem that snowfall is hardly accumulated. Additionally, most stations will become \"at-risk\" accumulated snow stations, indicating that both the snow depth and the snow cover duration will decline in most areas of the QTP, including a delay of the start date and an advancing of the end date of snow cover.

    "abstract": "Mountain glaciers in China are an important water source for both China and adjoining countries, and therefore their adaptation to glacier change is crucial in relation to maintaining populations. This study aims to improve our understanding of glacial vulnerability to climate change to establish adaptation strategies. A glacial numerical model is developed using spatial principle component analysis (SPCA) supported by remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) technologies. The model contains nine factors—slope, aspect, hillshade, elevation a.s.l., air temperature, precipitation, glacial area change percentage, glacial type and glacial area, describing topography, climate, and glacier characteristics. The vulnerability of glaciers to climate change is evaluated during the period of 1961–2007 on a regional scale, and in the 2030s and 2050s based on projections of air temperature and precipitation changes under the IPCC RCP6.0 scenario and of glacier change in the 21st century. Glacial vulnerability is graded into five levels: potential, light, medial, heavy, and very heavy, using natural breaks classification (NBC). The spatial distribution of glacial vulnerability and its temporal changes in the 21st century for the RCP6.0 scenario are analyzed, and the factors influencing vulnerability are discussed. Results show that mountain glaciers in China are very vulnerable to climate change, and 41.2% of glacial areas fall into the levels of heavy and very heavy vulnerability in the period 1961–2007. This is mainly explained by topographical exposure and the high sensitivity of glaciers to climate change. Trends of glacial vulnerability are projected to decline in the 2030s and 2050s, but a declining trend is still high in some regions. In addition to topographical factors, variation in precipitation in the 2030s and 2050s is found to be crucial.",

(2008) synthesized a set of high resolution lake sediment records from ACA and demonstrated that the nature of Holocene climatic and environmental evolution in both of the arid regions of Northwest China and the whole ACA differs from that of mid-latitude monsoon-dominated Asia. In fact, many studies have demonstrated the occurrence of different patterns of precipitation and/or moisture variations between westerly- dominated Asia and monsoon-dominated Asia on decadal(Ma and Fu,2006; Jiang et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2013) to multi-millennial time scales (Chen et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2011). Therefore,Chen et al. (2009) have argued that a westerlies-dominated climatic regime existed at different time-scales during the Holocene. Recent study(Huang et al., 2015) further outlined the core region influenced by the westerlies, including ACA and Xinjiang in China(Fig. 1) and indicated that the precipitation pattern of the westerlies-dominated climatic regime was caused by circum- global teleconnection (CGT) pattern (Ding and Wang, 2005). However, the study for climate change in ACA is scarce compared with the studies in monsoon-dominated Asia, and the recently climatic history and its change mechanism are specially needed to be further studied.",

If 10% of the biomass is utilized, more than 4 Gt of fuel ethanol and other bioenergy products can be produced, equivalent to 4.13 Gt of petroleum consumed by the world in 2014. Therefore, bioenergy can be a feasible alternative to fossil energy.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes a new weather generator – the 10-state empirical model – that combines a 10-state, first-order Markov chain with a non-parametric precipitation amounts model. Using a doubly-stochastic transition-matrix results in a weather generator for which the overall precipitation distribution (including both wet and dry days) and the temporal-correlation can be modified independently for climate change studies. This paper assesses the ability of the 10-state empirical model to simulate daily area-average precipitation in the Torne River catchment in northern Sweden/western Finland in the context of 3 other models: a 10-state model with a parametric (Gamma) amounts model; a wet/dry chain with the empirical amounts model; and a wet/dry chain with the parametric amounts model. The ability to accurately simulate the distribution of multi-day precipitation in the catchment is the primary consideration. Results showed that the 10-state empirical model represented accumulated 2- to 14-day precipitation most realistically. Further, the distribution of precipitation on wet days in the catchment is related to the placement of a wet day within a wet-spell, and the 10-state models represented this realistically, while the wet/dry models did not. Although all four models accurately reproduced the annual and monthly averages in the training data, all models underestimated inter-annual and inter-seasonal variance. Even so, the 10-state empirical model performed best. We conclude that the multi-state model is a promising candidate for hydrological applications, as it simulates multi-day precipitation well, but that further development is required to improve the simulation of interannual variation.",

This paper summarizes the current research conducted on the CAV since the 1960s. The objective definition of the CAV has been revised and a deep and shallow CAV classification proposed. Two high-frequency areas of deep CAV activity are the Kazakhstan hills (Sayan mountains) and the eastern area of the Aral Sea (Tashkent); events mostly occur in summer and 40% cause strong rainfall. In addition, two high-frequency activity areas of the shallow CAV are located in the west and south of the Pamirs Plateau and mostly occur in spring; 23.2% of occurrences cause strong rainfall. The western and eastern water vapor transport relates to westerlies and a strong low-level easterly jet stream (LLEJ) extending from Gansu to Xinjiang, respectively, and water vapor over the Tibetan Plateau transports even more northwards and enters Xinjiang. The deep CAV has an obvious cold core structure down to 300 hPa. The conversion terms from eddy available potential energy (AE) to eddy kinetic energy (KE) and eddy kinetic energy inflow (BKE) from the open atmospheric region boundaries are the main sources of KE which cause rapid development of the CAV. The anomalous anti-cyclone center over the northeast Atlantic is the fountain of Rossby wave energy dispersion; Rossby waves propagate from the northeast Atlantic to eastern Europe (Urals (EEU)), and then continuously propagate to Central Asia causing development of the CAV. The CAV requires further study to characterize the meso-scale system structure and evolution characteristics. In addition, physical modeling of the severe convective weather occurring under the CAV is required to determine the critical impacts of this severe convective weather and enable forecasting and early-warning indexes.",

Growth–climate response analyses revealed that the tree rings of spruce at the upper timberline of the Tien Shan also can provide hydrometeorological (precipitation and streamflow) signals. Tree-ring records from both Kyrgyzstan and Xinjiang exhibited similar tree-growth variability at both annual and decadal time scales during the common period 1457–2009. In Xinjiang and Kyrgyzstan, tree growth was reduced during the Little Ice Age (LIA); however, the timing and magnitude of LIA differ between the two regions. During 1470–1660, the two chronologies diverged, and this phenomenon is considered to be caused by a different response to the harsh climate of the LIA. In this study, the tree-ring width series from the upper tree line of the Tien Shan is negatively associated with temperature. As opposed to previous studies, the tree-ring width series from the upper timberline of the Tien Shan appears to respond well to hydrometeorological factors. Therefore, we highlight the need for more detailed ecophysiological response studies for spruce trees at the upper timberline of the Tien Shan, in particular, with regard to the role of water availability and temperature during the growth season.",

Observational data were derived from the Hadley Center Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature dataset (HadISST) and coupled model outputs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Changes in PDO and AMV were examined using four models (bcc-csm1-1, CCSM4, IPSL-CM5A-LR, and MPI-ESM-LR) with long weak global warming scenarios (RCP2.6). These models captured the two low-frequency modes in both pre-industrial run and RCP2.6 run. Under weak global warming, the time scales of PDO and AMV significantly decreased while the amplitude only slightly decreased. Interestingly, the standard deviation of the North Pacific sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) decreased only in decadal time scale, and that of the North Atlantic SSTA decreased both in interannual and decadal time scales. The coupled system consists of a slow ocean component, which has a decadal time scale, and a fast atmospheric component, which is calculated by subtracting the decadal from the total. Results suggest that under global warming, PDO change is dominated by ocean dynamics, and AMV change is dominated by ocean dynamics and stochastic atmosphere forcing.",

The improved track model is further used to understand the TC track change during the period of 1979–2016. In 1979–2016, the TC activity has been suppressed in the South China Sea (SCS) while the TC influence along the southeast coastal regions of China has been increased. The sensitivity experiments indicate that the change of the formation location plays a dominant role in decreasing TC influence in the SCS while the change of the environmental steering flows increases the TC influence in the eastern coastal region of China.

The results show that most of 26 models perform well in simulating the spatial structure of the climatology of the annual mean Hadley circulation, but the results derived from these models are generally weaker than that derived from the reanalysis dataset. Eighteen models can properly simulate well the asymmetric mode and symmetric mode of the annual mean Hadley circulation variability. Two models can only simulate asymmetric mode or symmetric mode and the other two models simulate reversed sequences of asymmetric mode and symmetric mode. The possible reason why some models cannot properly simulate the asymmetric mode and symmetric mode is that these models do not properly simulate the structure of zonal mean sea surface temperature (SST). Especially, not properly simulating variances of symmetric and asymmetric components of the SSTA will lead to reversed sequence of symmetric mode and asymmetric mode. And not properly simulated either symmetric or asymmetric component of the SSTA will lead to inability in simulating symmetric mode or asymmetric mode. On the other hand, some models properly simulate the asymmetric mode and symmetric mode, but do not properly simulate the responses to SST change. These models can not reflect the air sea coupling processes in associated with the Hadley circulation, therefore they should be taken more care when classify the models into groups.",

    "abstract": "In the Lancang‒Mekong River basin (LMRB), agriculture, dominating the local economy, faces increasing challenges in water supply under climate change. The projection of future precipitation in this basin is essential for understanding the challenges. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was applied to project the LMRB precipitation. Comparing with the historical period (1986–2005), we analyzed the changes of both the projected precipitation amount and the frequency of rainless (<0.1 mm d−1), light rain (0.1–10 mm d−1), moderate rain (10–25 mm d−1), heavy rain (25–50 mm d−1), rainstorm (50–100 mm d−1), and heavy rainstorm (>100 mm d−1) for three periods, namely the near-term (2016–2035), mid-term (2046–2065), and long-term (2080–2099). The results indicate that the precipitation amount during the wet season (April–October) is expected to increase in most areas of the basin for the three periods. As for the precipitation during the dry season (November–March), an increase is projected in most areas for the near-term, while an increase in the lower reach of the basin and a decrease in the upper and middle reach for the mid-term and long-term. The precipitation reduction is expected to be greatest in Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, and Yunnan province of China for the mid-term. The frequency of precipitation in different intensities has prominent regional and temporal differences. During the wet season, the days of rainless and light rain are expected to decrease in the middle reach, whereas the days of rainstorm and heavy rainstorm increase. This feature is especially strong in southern Thailand, southern Laos and Cambodia in the near-term and in Laos and Thailand for the mid-term and long-term. During the dry season, there are projected increasing rainless days and decreasing days of precipitation for the other intensities in the middle reach, and opposite in the rest area of the basin. These projected precipitation changes have potential various impact in different parts of the basin. The middle reach would likely face increasing flood risks because of more days of rainstorm and heavy rainstorm, as well as more precipitation. Yunnan, Myanmar, Thailand and Laos would probably be the center of drought threatens during the dry season due to the increment of rainless days and the precipitation reduction. Besides, the seawater intrusion during the dry season in the near-term and mid-term would be more serious as a result of the precipitation decrease in southern Vietnam.",

The resulting index can also be used to investigate how recent and future changes in the climatic conditions could affect livability. All Chinese cities and regions share the common goals of promoting low-carbon development, improving resilience against climate change, and integrating economic growth with climate actions. Climate services have been developed in China to provide decision-makers this measure of livability. Such a move facilitates sustainable development alongside economic growth by aiding government efforts in climate adaptation and low-carbon development. Our approach represents multidisciplinary and demand-driven research on adaptation to and the impacts of regional climate change, thereby transforming climate science into a climate service and ensuring that climate information can be provided in a scientific, practical, and customized way for policy-makers.

Thus, estimating water storage in alpine glaciers is critical for predicting the trend of glacier melting. This study compiled a rich set of ice thickness observations for glaciers of varying sizes in western China. We here presented a first-order assessment of the various errors involved in interpreting ice thickness from ground-penetrating radar (GPR) observations. An empirical Bayesian kriging (EBK) method was used for ice thickness interpolation and volume estimation. We then established a new volume-scaling law specific to western China glaciers based on these 36 volume-area pairs. And together with the Second Chinese Glacier Inventory (SCGI), we obtain a regional volume estimate of 4451 ± 298 km3. By comparison, we believed that this result is the most reliable estimate of the total ice storage in western China and more reliably predicts gross glacier melting. However, our results show that the method of glacier division can strongly affect the total volume estimation, which previous studies ignored. This emphasizes the need for more surveyed glaciers data and more accurate glacier inventory to improve the evaluation of the climate impact on glacier melting water resources and to help ensure the future survival of these alpine glaciers.",

Whether it could extend its influence and contribute to the Henan extreme rainfall in July 2021 still needs to be unraveled. We found that during the Henan extreme rainfall days a positively synoptic-scale vorticity disturbance dominated Henan province, China, which was embedded in the synoptic-scale wave train that originated from the western North Pacific. Moreover, the propagating pathway of this synoptic-scale wave train located northward and was likely modulated by the latitudinal location change of the monsoon trough over the western North Pacific. A northernmost displacement of the monsoon trough in July 2021 (∼23.2°N) would facilitate the synoptic-scale wave train to propagate farther northwestward via shifting the related barotropic conversion northward. Therefore, the synoptic-scale wave train from the tropics could reach Henan, provide the necessary lifting forcing, and supply abundant water vapor associated with the anomalous southerly for the occurrence of Henan extreme rainfall event. The results implicate that the pre-existing synoptic-scale wave train regulated by the location of the monsoon trough may be a potential precursor for heavy rainfalls in northern Central China.",

Following the recent global agreement on carbon market standards at COP26, this study explores linked ETSs as an avenue for the U.S. and China to cooperate on climate action. The emissions, energy, and economic effects of linked ETSs are analyzed through the China-in-Global Energy Model (C-GEM), a multi-regional, computable general equilibrium model. Assuming the development of national economy-wide ETSs, two scenarios are developed linking China and the U.S.: 1) a bilateral U.S.–China ETS linkage 2) a multilateral ETS linkage that includes China, the U.S., and nations in Southeast Asia. Results indicate that emissions and energy consumption outcomes would be similar in the bilateral and multilateral scenarios. However, economic outcomes are more favorable in the multilateral linkage scenario. When China and the U.S. engage in bilateral ETS linkage, China predominantly benefits from additional support for domestic decarbonization while the U.S. benefits from increased GDP compared to without ETS linkage. Adding Southeast Asia to establish multilateral linkage improves GDP outcomes for all participants, reducing adverse effects on China's GDP while boosting GDP for the U.S. and Southeast Asia. For policymakers considering the design and implementation of international ETSs, this study presents updated modeling on the effects of ETS linkage on each country as well as the economic benefits of expanding participation to additional regions.",

    "abstract": "Gross primary production (GPP) is the largest flux and a crucial player in the terrestrial carbon cycle and has been studied extensively, yet large uncertainties remain in the spatiotemporal patterns of GPP in both observations and simulations. This study evaluates the performance of the second version of the Beijing Climate Center Atmosphere−Vegetation Interaction Model (BCC_AVIM2.0) in simulating GPP on multiple spatial and temporal scales in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) experiments. Model simulations driven by two meteorological datasets were compared with two observation-based GPP products covering 1982–2008. Spatial patterns of annual GPP show a significant latitudinal gradient in each dataset, increasing from cold (tundra) and dry (desert) biomes to warm (temperate) and humid (tropical rainforest) biomes. BCC_AVIM2.0 overestimates GPP in most parts of the globe, especially in boreal forest regions and Southeast China, while underestimating GPP in subhumid regions in eastern South America and tropical Africa. The four datasets broadly agree on the GPP seasonal cycle, but BCC_AVIM2.0 predicts an earlier beginning of spring growth and a larger amplitude of seasonal variations than those in the observations. The observation-based datasets exhibit slight interannual variability (IAV) and weak GPP linear trends, while the BCC_AVIM2.0 simulations demonstrate relatively large year-to-year variability and significant trends in the low-latitudes and temperate monsoon regions in North America and East Asia. Regarding the possible relationships between annual means of GPP and climate factors, BCC_AVIM2.0 predicts more extensive regions of the globe where the IAV of annual GPP is dominated by precipitation, especially in mid-to-high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere and tropical Africa, while the observed GPP in the above regions is temperature- or radiation-dominant. The positive GPP biases due to earlier spring growth in boreal forest regions and negative GPP biases in off-equator tropical areas in the BCC_AVIM2.0 simulations imply that cold stress on biomes in boreal mid-to-high latitudes should be strengthened to restrain plant growth, while drought stress in low-latitude regions might be eased to enhance plant production in the future version of BCC_AVIM.",

The objective of this study is to explore near-zero emission pathways for the steel industry of China through a detailed technology assessment. The innovative technology development has been simulated using the AIM-China/steel model, developed by including material-based technologies and optimal cost analysis. Six scenarios have been given in terms of different levels of production output, emission reduction and carbon tax. Near-zero emission and carbon tax scenarios have shown that China's steel industry can achieve near-zero emission using electric furnaces and hydrogen-based direct reduction iron technologies with policy support. Based on these technologies, minimised production costs have been calculated, revealing that the steel produced by these technologies is cost-effective. Moreover, the feedstock cost can play a key role in these technology portfolios, especially the cost of scrap, iron ore and hydrogen. In addition, the feedstock supply can have strong regional effects and can subsequently impact the allocation of steelmaking in the future. Therefore, China can achieve near-zero emissions in the steel industry, and electric furnace and hydrogen-based direct reduction iron technologies are crucial to achieving them.",

    "abstract": "Highland barley (Hordeum vulgare Linn. cv. nudum Hook. f.) is the principal cereal crop over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The response of highland barely to climate change in the past decades, especially in terms of yields still remains uncertain. In this study, its responses to climate change were investigated using daily weather data and agriculture data during 1961-2018. The results showed that the annual mean air temperature over the TP increased at 0.33 °C per decade during 1961–2018, and the rate of warming increased with altitude, reaching 0.41 °C per decade at altitudes of 4500–4700 m. The growing degree days (GDDs) increased by 9.6% during 2011–2018 compared with the 1960s, whereas low temperature degree days (LDDs) decreased by 40.3% over the same period, indicating that the thermal conditions for highland barley cultivation have improved. A strong relationship was observed between the yield of highland barley and LDDs (-0.76, p < 0.001) than GDDs (0.58, p < 0.001) in Xizang, where sufficient irrigation water is available from the melting of snow cover or glaciers. In Sichuan, with abundant precipitation, significant correlations were noticed between county-level barley yield and GDDs and LDDs (0.60, p < 0.001; −0.65, p < 0.001). In Qinghai, the dry regions, county-level yields were influenced significantly by temperature and precipitation. These results indicated that climate warming was beneficial to highland barley yield in most region of the TP, mainly due to decreased LDDs. The potential altitude at which highland barley cultivation is feasible increased by approximately 280–484 m during 2016–2018, compared with 1981–1983. In Xizang, highland barley could be cultivated up to an altitude of 4507 m a.s.l. between 2016-2018, and it increased to 4179 m a.s.l. in Qinghai. These results could help local government to take actions to adapt to global warming and improve food security.",

However, the climate response of the National Determined Contributions (NDCs) remains uncertain due to unstable policies and their credibility. In this study, we calculated the uncertainty of global temperature rise caused by uncertain NDCs and carbon-neutral policies and discussed the difficulty of policy implementation. The results show that there will be 8 GtC uncertainty in emission at the end of the 21st century, responsible for the temperature rise of 0.37 °C (1.73–2.10 °C). A delayed policy in emission reduction by major emitters would result in a temperature rise of over 2 °C, while under non-delay policy, the 2 °C target will be possibly achieved. Besides, low-emission countries would introduce a 30 GtC cumulative emission uncertainty at the end of the 21st century if there are no restrictions, leading to a 0.3 °C global warming uncertainty. Developed countries need more substantial reductions in carbon intensity to achieve their climate policies while developing countries are under less pressure. The reduction of carbon intensity requires the strengthening of technical and economic methods. This study provides a reference for the realization of emission policies and temperature rise targets.",

    "abstract": "Climate change has resulted in an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme cold weather events, but few multicity or multicounty researches have explored the association between cold spells and mortality risk and burden. We collected daily data on climate, sociodemographic factors and mortality in 18 cities/counties across 11 geographical regions for the period of November to March, 2014–2018. A distributed lag nonlinear model was used to examine the association between cold spells and mortality after adjustment for confounding factors. Twelve definitions of cold spells were used. Multi-meta regression analysis was applied to pool the impacts over different regions. Cold spells were significantly associated with all-cause mortality at lag 0–21 (CRR:1.38, 95%CI:1.21,1.57). In addition to respiratory diseases and circulatory system diseases, digestive, endocrine and nervous system diseases and injury were also affected by cold spells. The magnitude of the impacts of cold spells on mortality varied among the diseases investigated, with the highest risk estimate found for influenza and pneumonia (CRR: 2.00, 95%CI: 1.45, 2.76) and the lowest estimate found for injury (CRR: 1.26, 95%CI: 1.09,1.46). The fraction of all-cause mortality attributable to cold spells was 2.31% (95%CI: 0.90%, 3.46%). Among the regional differences, the attributable burden of all-cause mortality was higher in rural areas and subtropical monsoon climate zone, with attributable fractions of 2.85% (95%CI: 1.23%, 4.11%) and 3.36% (95%CI: 0.55%, 5.35%), respectively. Cold spells increased mortality from a range of diseases. Women, older adults and residents of rural areas and subtropical monsoon climate zone were more vulnerable to cold spells impacts. The findings may help to formulate preventive strategies and early warning response plans to reduce mortality burden of extreme cold events.",

    "abstract": "Snow algal blooms have a remarkable climatic or environmental effect through influencing the snow–albedo feedback, accelerating the melting of surface snow, and amplifying global warming. Snow algal blooms occurred frequently on King George Island, Antarctic, during the recent six austral summers (December to next February) through 2017‒2022. Based on an assessment of satellite images, this study found that the range and amount of snow algal blooms in the summers of 2018, 2020, 2021 and 2022 are relatively larger than in the summers of 2017 and 2019. Whether meteorological conditions have shaped the year-to-year variation of algal bloom intensities is analyzed through observational composite. The results suggest that during the strong bloom summers there exist prevailing northerly or northwesterly wind anomalies which advect warm and humid airmass from the southern ocean into the island, increasing surface air temperature and humidity; the warmer and more humid surface favors melting of snow and an increase of low cloud cover, subsequently enhancing the atmospheric downward long-wave radiation and amplifying surface warmth; the increased low cloud cover reflects more ultraviolet rays back to space and weakens the short-wave radiation reaching the surface. All these factors together favor to a stronger bloom. In comparison, during 2017 and 2019 there exist weak southerly wind anomalies which induce the northward advection of cold and dry air from the Antarctic Continent and favor the cooler surface. Consequently, it is unfavorable for the snow algal bloom. Based on these results, a snow algal bloom potential index (API) integrating the meteorological conditions is constructed, and its future trend is projected based on the EC-Earth3 run attending the CMIP6 under SSP245 and SSP585. A significant increasing trend is projected especially under SSP585. Thus snow algal bloom on King George Island will become more frequent and stronger in future. This implies a potential accelerate melting of ice shelf over Antarctic Peninsula.",

    "abstract": "An update on the climate norms each decade is recommended by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) partly to keep pace with conditions as climate changes over time. In accordance with such update, this study documents the features of the new climate normal defined for 1991–2020 and its impacts on climate monitoring and prediction in China. With on-site observation and model prediction datasets, our analysis reveals that the new normal of national average precipitation of China during winter and summer is respectively 3.0 and 10.8 mm higher than that of the period 1981–2010. As a result, precipitation observations during 1961–2020 consistently fall below the new normal. The adjustment of thresholds for precipitation extremes with new climate normals results in a decrease of extreme precipitation occurrence by 0.2–0.8 d on average over the winter and summer seasons during 1961–2020. Meanwhile, the application of new climate normals induces more pronounced negative temperature anomalies across most areas of China. The adjustments of extreme temperature thresholds have led to an increased occurrence of extremely cold days by 1–2 d on average over 1961–2020, while the frequency of extremely hot days decreases by more than 1.4 d. Furthermore, it is implied that with the development of global warming, the baselines for temperature and precipitation are rising. The application of the new climate normal may result in the omission of relative threshold based extreme events, promoting increased focus on climate risk reduction studies. Additionally, the average anomaly sign consistency rates (Pcs) of precipitation and temperature anomaly predictions, relative to the new normal and produced by the Beijing Climate Center, are consistently lower than those relative to the old normal. This decrease in Pcs implies new challenges for climate prediction, especially for temperature prediction.",

The Arctic is colder on the Canadian side than on the European side under 1.5 °C warming. Sea ice is mostly less than three years old, and the younger, thinner and less concentrated ice is mainly in the seas along the NSR. Ships above Polar Class (PC) 6 might be unimpeded along two passages all the year. Besides, the NSR and NWP have great potential for PC6 ships in October–December, while it is only the NSR for PC7 ships. Caution is still required when navigating the western East Siberian Sea, its surrounding straits, and the Parry Channel. These changes in hydrological conditions are important for global shipping, and this work is helpful for supporting coordinated international decision-making.",

This paper systematically summarized the relevant research ideas, the technical methods used, and the obtained achievements through an extensive synthesis of the previous studies. Moreover, the major shortcomings and the limitations in the recent studies are pointed in order to present a useful reference for our Chinese investigators. It indicates that the future climate warming would cause the loss of skiable areas, the shortening of skiing seasons and the sharp drop of ski visitors in many low altitude and low latitude ski resorts. The paper finally stressed that future research should pay particular attention to strengthening interdisciplinary cooperation and consider more factors about the impacts of climate-induced environmental changes on tourist flows.

The model uses precipitation and temperature data from CISRO/MK3–5, MPI/ECHAM5, and NCAR/CCSM3 under three greenhouse gas emission scenarios (SRES A2, A1B, B1). The results in water resources and flood frequency suggest that annual precipitation and annual runoff would increase after 2050 relative to the reference period of 1961–1990. In addition, increasing trends have been projected in area averaged monthly precipitation and runoff from May to October, while decreasing trends in those from December to February. More often and larger floods would occur in future. Potential increase in runoff during the low-flow season could ease the pressure of water demand until 2030, but the increase in runoff in the high-flow season, with more often and larger floods, more pressure on flood control after 2050 is expected.

    "abstract": "As nearly a fifth of the world's population still lives without access to electricity and double that number with no access to modern cooking technologies, both public and private sector players have invested resources in developing infrastructure to address this energy gap. While there have been exceptional cases like China, Vietnam and Brazil, where the public sector led grid expansion achieved incredible gains in expanding access as to electricity, the general trend over the years in most developing countries has demonstrated that both public and private led approaches have been unsuccessful in independently yielding the desired acceleration and continuity to deliver universal energy access. Despite the inherent benefits of both public and private sector led initiatives, typical systemic inefficiencies and inadequate capacities in both approaches prevent them from fully addressing the principal objective of facilitating energy access for the poor in the long term. Also, even if required investments were adequately capitalized, with the current population growth rate continually outpacing the rate of interventions, the number of people who remained energy poor 15 years hence, would still be the same. Thus, not only is there is a need for providing energy access to the existing population mass, but an equal need to do it fast enough to truly reduce the number of energy poor across the globe. An alternative approach therefore needs to be explored that juxtaposes the social welfare objectives of public sector led initiatives with the enterprise development and growth objectives of the private sector, to support the creation of an enabling ecosystem and a viable value chain that successfully and effectively delivers energy solutions to the last mile. Such a pro-poor hybrid model will essentially address the inefficiencies and inadequacies of both public and private approaches and capitalize on their strengths through a complementary mix of social and commercial goals. The model facilitates collaborations at the corporate, institutional and individual levels to drive individual parts of a unified energy provisioning system, making it adaptable, dynamic, flexible and manoeuvrable within structures, relationships and entities. Policy level support and accompanying regulatory frameworks are critical for clear role definitions, proper planning and execution.",

The amplitude and phase lag of the K1 tidal component slightly decreased at the rate of −0.03 cm per year and −0.07° per year, respectively. The changes in extreme sea level in Hangzhou Bay were mainly caused by variations in mean sea level. The coastal areas of Hangzhou Bay at risk from flooding due to the 100-year sea level return will increase by about 400 km2 by 2050.",

    "abstract": "Firms in China within the same industry but with different ownership and size have different production functions and face different emission regulations and financial conditions, thus can give very different responses to environmental policies. This fact has been largely ignored in most of the low-carbon development related literature. Using an augmented Chinese input–output table in which information about firm size (large- and small and medium-sized firms) and ownership (state-, foreign-, and private-owned firms) are explicitly reported, a dynamic computable general equilibrium model is developed in this study to analyze the impact of alternative low-carbon policy designs with different regulatory coverage and financial equalization on heterogeneous firms. Our simulation results show that, with the fully balanced regulation coverage and equalized financial system for heterogeneous firms, the total green investment accounts for 4% of GDP in 2030 for fulfilling China's commitment to reduce carbon emissions, which is the lowest among the various scenarios; about one-third of this investment is made by small and private firms; at the same time, green investment efficiency will be the highest, about 84% higher than that of the business-as-usual level. Therefore, a market-oriented and new technology-driven arrangement and mechanism for sharing emission reduction burden and allocating green investment across heterogeneous firms, especially to small and medium-sized firms, is crucial for China to achieve a more ambitious emission target in the long run.",

Compared to simulations without climate change, the simulation with a climate sensitivity of 3.0 K shows that in 2100, due to increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations, the simulated sea surface temperature increases by 2.7 K, the intensity of the North Atlantic deep water formation reduces by 4.5 Sv, and the oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2 decreases by 0.8 Pg C. Climate change is also found to have a large effect on the North Atlantic's ocean column inventory of anthropogenic CO2. Between the years 1800 and 2500, compared with the simulation with no climate change, the simulation with climate change causes a reduction in the total anthropogenic CO2 column inventory over the entire ocean and in North Atlantic by 23.1% and 32.0%, respectively. A set of simulations with climate sensitivity variations from 0.5 K to 4.5 K show that with greater climate sensitivity climate change would have a greater effect in reducing the ocean's ability to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere.",

China's first global monthly temperature dataset over land was developed by integrating the four aforementioned global temperature datasets and several regional datasets from major countries or regions. This dataset contains information from 9,519 stations worldwide of at least 20 years for monthly mean temperature, 7,073 for maximum temperature, and 6,587 for minimum temperature. Compared with CRUTEM3 and GHCN-V3, the station density is much higher particularly for South America, Africa, and Asia. Moreover, data from significantly more stations were available after the year 1990 which dramatically reduced the uncertainty of the estimated global temperature trend during 1990–2011. The integrated dataset can serve as a reliable data source for global climate change research.",

    "abstract": "We have arrived at a critical juncture when it comes to understanding the numerous ways in which trade interacts with climate change and energy (trade-climate-energy nexus). Trade remains crucial for the sustainable development of the world's greatest trading nation: China. After clarifying the linkages within the trade, climate change and energy nexus, this article delves into China's specific needs and interests related to trade, climate change and energy. Then it explores the ways in which trade can contribute to China's needs, to sustainable energy development and to the goals of the global climate agreement that is under negotiation. One main findings are China is a key participant in negotiations on trade liberalization of environmental technologies and services. These negotiations are in China's interests in terms of innovative industries, technological upgrading, employment and public health. China could stand up for the interests of other emerging and developing countries and serve as an example in terms of transitioning to a low-carbon economy. Beyond trade barriers issues of domestic (energy) regulation such as fossil-fuel subsidies as well as investment, competition-policy, trade-facilitation and transit issues related to clean energy need to be addressed. Building trust between relevant actors across sectors and national borders will be of the essence in order to foster long-term cooperation on technological innovation. As a way forward, different approaches towards the governance of trade and climate change will be highlighted. Besides discussing the specific aspects of Chinese participation in global trade and climate change governance, this paper aims at offering broader insights into the nexus between trade, energy and climate governance in China.",

Improvement is limited with the Ångström Exponent (AE) simulation, except for much improved correlation coefficient and model skill scores over the Ansai site. Better agreement of the AOD spatial distribution with the independent observations of Terra (Deep Blue) and Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) AODs is obtained by assimilating the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD product, especially for regions with AODs lower than 0.30.

    "abstract": "Ski tourism is extremely sensitive to climate change and is also heavily affected by socioeconomic conditions. Although some ski areas are still profitable under current climate and socioeconomic conditions, they will become difficult to operate in the face of rising winter temperatures, which will result in further economic losses, resource waste and environmental damage. This study projects variability in the suitability of ski area development across China in the coming decades. Natural suitability under three representative concentration pathway emission scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), socioeconomic suitability under four shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP1, SSP2, SSP3, and SSP5) and integrated suitability under four climatic-socioeconomic scenarios (RCP2.6-SSP1, RCP4.5-SSP2, RCP8.5-SSP3, and RCP8.5-SSP5) are reported. Furthermore, the suitability of 731 existing ski areas in China is assessed. The results show a substantial decline in integrated suitability for most regions of China except for some very cold areas, where higher air temperatures will make visitors feel more comfortable and the relatively poor socioeconomic conditions will improve in the 2030s, 2050s and 2090s. The average higher integrated suitability area (integrated suitability values greater than 0.5) under four climatic-socioeconomic scenarios decreases from the current 29.9%–14.4%, 5.0% and 4.5% by the 2030s, 2050s and 2090s, respectively. Under RCP2.6-SSP1, the higher integrated suitability area is projected to decrease from the current 28.0%–5.2% by the 2050s and then increase to 5.3% by the 2090s. Under RCP4.5-SSP2, RCP8.5-SSP3, and RCP8.5-SSP5, the higher integrated suitability area is projected to continuously decrease from 30.3%, 30.6% and 30.6% in the 2010s to 4.1%, 4.4% and 4.4% in the 2090s, respectively. By the 2090s, 41, 138 and 277 existing ski areas are projected to be closed under RCP2.6-SSP1, RCP4.5-SSP2, and RCP8.5-SSP3/RCP8.5-SSP5, respectively. It is clear that emission pathways and climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies will greatly shape the development of China's regional ski tourism.",

    "abstract": "Sea ice conditions in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) play a key role in the navigation of the Northwest Passage (NWP). Limited by observed sea ice thickness data, the research of temporal and spatial variation of sea ice in the NWP is insufficient. Based on the observed sea ice concentration and simulated thickness data, the temporal and spatial characteristics of sea ice concentration, extent and thickness from 1979 to 2017 in the NWP of the CAA were studied. The more specific pathways of the northern and southern routes of the NWP were evaluated. Against the background of the rapid retreat of Arctic sea ice, the 39-year observed sea ice concentration and extent of the NWP exhibited a relatively large decreasing trend in summer and fall, while heavy sea ice conditions were maintained in winter and spring, with slightly increasing trend in some subregions. The sea ice thickness in most subregions of the NWP showed a decreasing trend, with exception of Lancaster Sound. The sea ice thickness was larger along the northern route than the southern routes. The significant correlation (p < 0.05) between sea ice and surface air temperature (SAT) and sea surface temperature (SST) in the NWP suggested that the surface thermodynamic factors had a greater impact on sea ice in the summer and fall, and the variations of sea ice concentration were more closely correlated with the surface thermodynamic factors than sea ice thickness. The SST had a higher correlation with sea ice concentration than SAT, while SAT exhibited a higher correlation with sea ice thickness than SST. The remaining sea ice concentration and thickness in the fall, associated with the summer and fall SAT and SST, contributed to the formation of sea ice in the following winter and spring. The heat content and mixed layer depth were also be considered as the vertical thermodynamic factors to the sea ice condition in the NWP.",

Previous assessments of differential impacts of two targets indicate that 1.5 °C warming target would substantially reduce the impact on human health compared to 2 °C, but they mainly focused on the magnitude of temperature changes under future climate change scenarios without any consideration of greater frequency of cumulative heat exposures within a day. Here we quantified the health risks of compound daytime and nighttime hot extremes using morbidity data in a megacity of China, and also identified the time-period of heat exposure with higher risks. Then we projected future morbidity burden attributable to compound hot extremes due to the half-degree warming. We estimated that the 2 °C warming scenario by 2100 as opposed to 1.5 °C would increase annual heat-related ambulance dispatches by 31% in Shenzhen city. Substantial additional impacts were associated with occurrence of consecutive hot days and nights, with ambulance dispatches increased by 82%. Our results suggested that compound hot extremes should be considered in assessment of heat-related health impacts, particularly in the context of climate change. Minimizing the warming of climate in a more ambitious target can significantly reduce the health damage.",

Therefore, the influence of different reference climate states on the accuracy of SPI calculation is worth analyzing. Based on the monthly precipitation data of 1184 stations in China from 1961 to 2010, the influence of the selection of the reference climatic state in the calculation of SPI was analyzed. Using 30 consecutive years as the duration of the reference climatic state, 1961–2010 is divided into three periods 1961–1990, 1971–2000, 1981–2010. Taking the SPI obtained from the entire period as the standard value, the spatial distribution of SPI error and the accuracy of SPI classification based on each reference period were analyzed. Then, the resampling method was used to analyze the influence of time-continuous precipitation samples on the size of SPI. The results show that the SPI error of most sites is less than 0.2, and the accuracy of SPI classification is more than 80%. Although the errors of SPI mostly come from extreme drought and extremely wet, this does not affect the accuracy of the recognition of extreme drought and extremely wet. In most regions, it is reliable to calculate SPI based on the precipitation data of continuous 30 years, but the reliability of SPI is relatively low in areas with frequent drought. The results of the resampling analysis and 30-year sliding analysis show that the distribution parameters have noticeable turning characteristics, and the precipitation distribution parameters of nearly 85% stations had noticeable turning point before 1985, which led to the precipitation data of continuous 30 years easily overestimate the dry/wet.",

    "abstract": "Opposite anthropogenic aerosol emission trends in Asia can lead to different responses of the climate. Here, we examined the responses of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) to changes in Asian anthropogenic aerosol emissions during 2006–2014 using a global aerosol/atmospheric chemistry–climate coupled model (BCC_AGCM2.0_CUACE/Aero) with two sets of emission inventories: the Community Emissions Data System (CEDS) inventory adopted by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) and the inventory developed at Peking University (PKU). The changes in Asian anthropogenic aerosol emissions during 2006–2014 between the two inventories were remarkably different, particularly in eastern China where completely opposite trends were observed (i.e., increase in the CEDS inventory, but significant reduction in the PKU inventory). The perturbation simulations with the Asian anthropogenic aerosol forcing from the two inventories showed opposite changes in aerosol optical depth, aerosol effective radiative forcing, cloud liquid water path, and total cloud cover in eastern China. The simulated 'dipole-type' changes (i.e., increase in India but decrease in China) in Asian aerosols and the resulting changes in local radiation budget under the PKU inventory were consistent with the corresponding observations. The summer surface temperatures over eastern China decreased by 0–0.4 K because of the Asian anthropogenic aerosol forcing under the CEDS inventory, while they increased by 0.1–0.8 K under the PKU inventory. The weakening of the EASM index caused by the Asian aerosol forcing under the PKU inventory was twofold greater than that under the CEDS inventory (−0.4 vs. −0.2). The Asian 'dipole-type' aerosol forcing contributed to the observed summer 'southern drought and northern flood' phenomenon in eastern China during 2006–2014. The slow ocean-mediated response to the regional 'dipole-type' aerosol forcing dominated the weakening of the EASM circulation and the precipitation changes in eastern China in the total response. This study further confirms that the biases in anthropogenic aerosol emissions over Asia can affect the CMIP6-based regional climate attribution.",

In this study, we used TC observations, reanalysis data and model experiments to analyze the RI occurrences during local TCs and entering TCs in 1980–2016. We found that the significant interannual and interdecadal variations in RI occurrences during local eastward-moving TCs were related to the strong intraseasonal oscillation (ISO) over the SCS and the WNP under La Niña conditions. RI during local westward-moving TCs showed insignificant variations as a result of the complex interactions among the monsoon trough, ISO and the large-scale circulation. RI during entering TCs showed strong interdecadal variations, with increased RI after 1997, even though the total number of entering TCs has decreased since 1997, which is a result of a higher number of entering TCs in the northwestern quadrant of the WNP, a stronger ISO and weak vertical windshear over the SCS and east of the Philippines under negative phase of Pacific Decadal Oscillation. The different variations and related mechanisms of RI indicates that distinct forecasting factors should be considered for intensity prediction during local eastward- and westward-moving TCs and entering TCs.",

    "abstract": "With the rising popularity of the concept of \"carbon neutralization\", low-carbon products are likely to gain more advantages. Related to this, green tea— an important beverage that is widely consumed in China—along with emissions from planting, processing, and use phase should be given attention. Meanwhile, quantifying the carbon footprint (CF) of green tea is an essential task in developing the pathway to carbon neutrality. In this study, we quantified the CF and mitigation potential of green tea through life cycle assessment, after which we investigated the pathway toward carbon neutrality in 16 major tea-producing regions (except Hainan and Taiwan) in China. The system boundary was divided into six subsystems from cradle to grave: cultivation, processing, transport, packaging, consumption, and disposal. The results showed that the total carbon emissions of green tea reached 44.13 Mt CO2eq in 2019, of which 43% came from consumption and 28% from cultivation. There were 18.78 Mt CO2eq emissions from fertilizer production and application, while there was a 7.71 Mt CO2eq carbon sink of tea trees. The average carbon intensity was 24.30 kg CO2eq kg−1 tea, while Shandong and Guizhou ranked as the top two provinces. Sichuan, Hubei, and Yunnan Provinces had the largest amounts of carbon emissions at 6.79, 6.14, and 5.96 Mt CO2eq, respectively. By 2030, 2050 and 2060, total carbon emissions would be reduced by 46%, 63%, and 86%, respectively, under carbon neutrality assumption. A small amount of 6.14 Mt CO2eq carbon emissions was retained to be offset by carbon trading or zero-carbon cultivation. Finally, the results indicate that adopting low-carbon fertilizers and clean energies will be a key entry point for carbon-neutral green tea.",

    "abstract": "The response of vegetation to global warming is closely related to human living environment, and uncertainty in understanding the response remains. This study aims to investigate the effects of CO2, temperature and precipitation changes under global warming on natural vegetation in Asia. The biophysical/dynamic vegetation model SSiB4/TRIFFID was employed to perform numerical experiments under different climate scenarios for Asia using the Princeton global forcing dataset (1948–2006). The results showed that precipitation and CO2 were the key factors for vegetation growth. The effect of temperature on natural vegetation varied among the study regions. Generally, an increase in temperature was conducive to vegetation growth in eastern Asia, but not in the arid and semi-arid areas of western Asia. In arid and semi-arid areas or in the vicinity of desert, the forcing effects of temperature, precipitation and CO2 were more remarkable, which led to a noticeable change in the area of bare land. In terms of the distribution of vegetation species, the above forcing had a greater impact on shrubs, C3 grasses and C4 plants, but less of an impact on broadleaf and coniferous forest. It was also found that, although there was a notable positive correlation between precipitation and vegetation leaf area index in northern high latitudes, the vegetation cover did not increase with precipitation, which was countered by the negative effect of surface cooling in summer.",

    "abstract": "Studies about high temperatures in China rarely touched the period beyond summer. But in September–early October 2021, a record-breaking high temperature event occurred in southern China, and affected agriculture in many provinces. Both the daily maximum temperature and the number of high temperature days were the highest in September since 1951. To better understand the different features and possible causes of the extreme event in autumn from those in summer, the analysis of atmospheric circulation patterns was conducted. The western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) was quite stronger and extended much more westward in most of the days in September 2021 than its climatology, which directly caused this unprecedented autumn high temperature event. Besides, the mid-latitude trough over the east of Japan may also play an essential role in this high temperature event. Due to the southward extension of the trough, a cyclonic circulation anomaly appeared at 850 hPa, and its northerly wind component prevailed in the west of the trough and blocked the eastward retreat of the WPSH. As a result, southern China was stably controlled by the WPSH, which led to the persistence of this high temperature event. The conclusion is further confirmed by the statistical results from the analysis of the multi-year data and analogue analysis. Compared to the previous studies, this study reveals the essential role of the mid-latitude trough and highlights the joint impacts of the WPSH and the trough in causing the unprecedented autumn high temperature event.",

    "abstract": "With diverse atmospheric circulation and complex mechanisms, typhoon remote rainstorms (TRR) are closely related to a variety of mid-low latitude systems. The anomalous signatures in such processes can improve forecasting heavy rainfall associated with typhoons and fill the gaps in current physical conceptual models of TRR. Using the optimal typhoon path dataset, ground observation data, and the National Centres for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis dataset, the impact of anomalous water vapour transport on excessive rainfall in North China is investigated. The vector empirical orthogonal function (VEOF) analysis is applied to typhoon precipitation events from 1970 to 2021, and three major modes are extracted to reflect the anomalous water vapour transport for typhoon precipitation. Mode 1 reflects a moisture circulation pattern in North China due to the coexistence of typhoons and remote and direct precipitation, with the highest probability of heavy precipitation. The differences in remote precipitation areas and intensities are attributed to the location of typhoons in the western North Pacific and the shifting of the subtropical high ridge. To characterise the water vapour transport circulation of TRR in North China, we proposed the 'multi-vortex' idea. The transmission of the multi-vortex ensures a continuous supply of TRR water vapour, and the enhancement of the multi-vortex is significantly linked to the enhancement of remote precipitation. Three extreme northern rainstorms, 75·8 Henan, 7·21 Beijing, and 7·20 Zhengzhou rainstorms, have anomalous multi-vortex water vapour convergence, similar to Mode 1. The mechanism of water vapour driven by multi-vortex in the three severe rainstorm events is more extreme than in usual TRR events in North China. The stronger Indian low vortex and relatively southerly subtropical highs can intensify the southwest branch of the double water vapour transport branch, whereas the strengthening of typhoons in the western North Pacific facilitates water vapour transport through the channel on the southwestern side of the subtropical highs and then transports it to key rainstorm areas, promoting TRR development. Therefore, the combination of subtropical highs, typhoons, and the anomalous multi-vortex structure may help in the establishment of key indicators of extreme precipitation in North China.",

    "abstract": "The surface energy budget is crucial for Arctic sea ice mass balance calculation and climate systems, among which turbulent heat fluxes significantly affect the air–sea exchanges of heat and moisture in the atmospheric boundary layer. Satellite observations (e.g. CERES and APP-X) and atmospheric reanalyses (e.g., ERA5) are often used to represent components of the energy budget at regional and pan-Arctic scales. However, the uncertainties of the satellite-based turbulent heat fluxes are largely unknown, and cross-comparisons with reanalysis data and in-situ observations are limited. In this study, satellite-based turbulent heat fluxes were assessed against in-situ observations from the N-ICE2015 drifting ice station (north of Svalbard, January–June 2015) and ERA5 reanalysis. The turbulent heat fluxes were calculated by two approaches using the satellite-based ice surface temperature and radiative fluxes, surface atmospheric parameters from ERA5, and snow/sea ice thickness from the pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS). We found that the bulk-aerodynamic formula based results could better capture the variations of turbulent heat fluxes, while the maximum entropy production based estimates are comparable with ERA5 in terms of root-mean-square error (RMSE). CERES-based estimates outperform the APP-X-based ones but ERA5 performs the best in all seasons (RMSE of 18 and 7 W m−2 for sensible and latent heat flux, respectively). The air–ice temperature/humidity differences and the surface radiation budget were found the primary driving factors in the bulk-formula method and maximum entropy production (MEP) method, respectively. Furthermore, errors in the surface and near-surface temperature and humidity explain almost 50% of the uncertainties in the estimates based on the bulk-formula, whereas errors in the net radiative fluxes explain more than 50% of the uncertainties in the MEP-based results.",

    "abstract": "The Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) region is the political center and one of the largest and most dynamic economic centers in China. Relative to other regions of China, it faces greater challenges from increasing hot extremes. However, future projections of regional changes in hot extremes based on multi-model ensembles carry huge uncertainty. To improve the reliability of regional projections, we used the latest high-resolution outputs from nine GCMs in CMIP6-HighResMIP and constrained the projection of hot extremes in this region. In the BTH, the historical scaling of the annual maximum temperature with the mean summer (June–August) temperatures (TXx scaling) showed a significant linear relationship with the future TXx scaling in the multi-model ensemble. By comparing the observed and simulated historical TXx scaling we identified an observational constraint that could reduce the uncertainty of TXx scaling. We believed that the simulations of EC-Earth3P, EC-Earth3P-HR, MPI-ESM1-2-HR and MPI-ESM1-2-XR show advantages in simulating surface air temperature and related hot extremes in this region. Verification demonstrated that surface air temperature projection in the BTH region constrained by observational constraint is more reliable. In constrained projections, by the 2040s, the increase in summer surface air temperatures is projected to exceed 1 °C compared to 2010s. Also, the estimated number of days of compound (sequential hot day-night) hot extremes (HND), independent hot nights (HNi) and independent hot days (HDi) was found to increase by 0.3, 0.3, and −0.03 d per year during 2015–2049, respectively. The growth in numbers of days of HND, HNi and HDi was slower after observational constraint. Furthermore, the estimated increase in surface air temperature variables after constraint also reduced. This study provides support for adaptation policy-making and as a reference for the use of observational constraint in other regions of China.",

    "abstract": "The ENSO-induced Pacific–South America (PSA) pattern is an important atmospheric bridge in linking the Antarctic climate to the tropical Pacific. The AGCM simulated PSA-like responses to ENSO are evidently weaker than the observed in terms of its intensity due to the lack of air–sea coupling processes. The Tasman Sea features active air-sea interactions. However, how and to what extent the air-sea coupling explains the deficiency of the AGCM responses to ENSO is unclear. In this study, the role of the air–sea coupling elsewhere the tropical Pacific in shaping the ENSO–South Pacific teleconnection is first estimated by comparing the coupled tropical Pacific pacemaker experiments (PACE) derived from the Community Earth System Model Version 1 (CESM1) and the parallel Pacific Ocean-Global Atmosphere experiments (POGA) with the same atmospheric component model of CESM1. Our results suggest that the air–sea coupling elsewhere the tropical Pacific greatly intensifies the South Pacific atmospheric response to ENSO. Then the separated impact of air–sea coupling over the Tasman Sea is stressed with another set of AGCM experiments forced with the PACE sea surface temperature (SST) outputs in the Tasman Sea. The results show that the atmospheric response to the SST anomalies in the Tasman Sea bears a remarkable resemblance to that due to the air–sea coupling elsewhere the tropical Pacific, and explains about 30% of the intensified amplitude. This highlights a substantial contribution of the air–sea coupling over the Tasman Sea to intensifying the extratropical South Pacific atmospheric responses to ENSO, and provides a new perspective on the connection between tropical Pacific and Antarctic climate change.",

Methane generation potential (L0) and methane generation rate constant (k) are two key parameters in the first-order model. Coal-ash based default values or roughly analyzed values often used in China may not be appropriate for accurately estimating of LFG generation. In this study, seven groups of parameterswere evaluated by comparing the theoretical predictions with real measurements from five Chinese landfills. The optimal approach for calculating L0 is the use of site-specific waste composition and the default values of degradable organic carbon (DOC) reported by the Chinese industry standard (CJJ133-2009), and the matching k can be adjusted by fitting and regression. The optimized average values were L0 = 67 m3 Mg−1, k = 0.06 per year for landfills in Beijing and Zhengzhou in cold‒dry regions, L0 = 69 m3 Mg−1, k = 0.16 per year for landfill in Shanghai in cold‒wet region, and L0 = 64 m3 Mg−1, k = 0.21 per year for landfills in Guangzhou and Shengzhen in hot‒wet regions. Monte Carlo analysis showed that the uncertainty of LFG generation at closure year varied in −22.5%‒20.5%, −17.1%‒17.1% and −28.2%‒34.7% for three climatic regions, respectively. The k value is the key influencing factor, with a 95.6% contribution ratio in the hot‒wet region landfill. The results provide references for future better waste management.",

However, the interdecadal varibility of winter extreme precipitation over the TP and its linkage with Arctic sea ice are still unclear. In this study, the characteristics and mechisnems of the TP extreme precipitation (TPEP) influenced by Arctic sea ice on interdecadal timescale are studied based on the daily precipitation, monthly sea ice concentration and ERA5 reanalysis data from 1980 to 2018. We found that the dominant mode of the TPEP in winter mostly exhibits a uniform spatial variation on the interdecadal timescale, with an opposite weak variation in the southeastern TP, and the Arctic sea ice concetration (SIC) before 2002 are larger than that after 2003. The interdecadal variation of TPEP is affected by two teleconnection wave trains regulated by the Barents and Kara Sea ice. In the light ice years, a remarkable positive geopotential height (HGT) anomaly appears over the Barents‒Kara Sea and a remarkable negative HGT anomaly is located over the Lake Baikal. Two wave trains originating over the Barents‒Kara Sea can be observed. The southern branch forms a wave train through the North Atlantic along the subtropical westerly jet stream, showing a '+ − + − +' pattern of geopotential height (HGT) anomalies from Arctic to the TP. Negative HGT anomaly controls the western TP, which creates dynamic and water vapor conditions for the TPEP. The northern branch forms a wave train through the Lake Baikal and the southeast of the TP, showing a '+ − +' HGT anomaly distribution. Positive HGT anomaly controls the southeastern TP, which is not conducive to precipitation in the region. When the SIC in the Barents‒Kara Sea increases, the situation is opposite. The above analysis also reveals the reason for the difference in the east‒west distribution of the TPEP.",

However, how the start of the thermal growing season (SOS-T) and the start of the rainy season (SORS) as key climatic factors affect vegetation green-up remains unclear. Given that these factors characterize thermal and water conditions required for vegetation green-up, this study investigated changes in the SOS-T and SORS from 1961 to 2022, using observation-based datasets with long time series. We found that the SOS-T and SORS have advanced across the TP in 1961‒2022 and have shown a spatial pattern of advancement in the east and delay in the west in 2000‒2022. Further, the co-effect of temperature and precipitation change on the start of vegetation growing season (SOS-V) in 2000‒2022 was observed. Averaged across TP, the SOS-V had an early onset of 1.3 d per decade during 2000‒2022, corresponding to advanced SOS-T and SORS. Regionally, the SOS-V generally occurred nearly at the same time as the SOS-T in the high-altitude meadow region. A substantial delay in the SOS-V relative to the SOS-T was observed in the desert, shrub, grassland and forest regions and generally kept pace with the SORS. Furthermore, for 50% of the vegetated regions on the TP, inter-annual variation in the delay in the SOS-V relative to the SOS-T was dominated by precipitation change, which was profound in warm-climate regions. This study highlights the co-regulation of precipitation and temperature change in the SOS-V in different vegetation cover regions in the TP, offering a scientific foundation for comprehending the impact of climate change and prospects for vegetation phenology on the TP.",

    "abstract": "Quantification of the impact of winter wheat irrigation on the climate and the occurrence of extreme climatic events over North China is crucial for regional adaptation planning. Previous related studies mainly focused on the impact on surface processes; however, few focused on the effects of extreme events using high-resolution nonhydrostatic regional climate models. Here, the 9-km-resolution nonhydrostatic RegCM4.7 was coupled with a crop irrigation scheme and an updated winter wheat irrigation dataset to better simulate irrigation effects. Two experiments were conducted with and without winter wheat irrigation to isolate the effects of irrigation. Results showed that irrigation simulation reduces the model biases in temperature, precipitation, latent heat flux, soil moisture, sensitive heat flux, and top-layer soil moisture. Moreover, it also reduces the bias and increases the correlation with observations obtained in irrigated areas, especially in summer, indicating better representation of irrigation schemes. Winter wheat irrigation tends to cause substantial cooling of the local surface maximum, minimum, and mean air temperatures (by −0.79, −0.34, and −1.68 °C, respectively) over irrigated areas of North China, with the largest changes observed in relation to maximum temperature. Additionally, precipitation is found to increase during spring and summer, which is strongly related to water vapor transport in the lower levels of the atmosphere. Further analyses indicated that the number of annual mean hot days decrease (−13.9 d), whereas the number of both comfort days (+10.2 d) and rainy days (days with total precipitation greater than 1 mm: +6.6 d) increase over irrigated areas, demonstrating beneficial feedback to human perception and agriculture. Fortunately, although the heat wave risk increases (number of annual mean heat wave days: +5.8 d), the impact is limited to small areas within irrigated region. Additionally, no notable change was found in terms of heavy rainfall events and precipitation intensity, which might be a undereastimation caused by the less water use in model simulation. Although winter wheat irrigation does not have notable impact on the climate of the surrounding region, it is an important factor for the local-scale climate.",

These reductions may contribute to additional warming of the climate system in the short term, thereby strongly affecting the likelihood of climate extremes. However, there has been no quantitative assessment of the impact of non-methane SLCF mitigation on compound flood–heatwave extremes (CFHEs). This study quantitatively investigates the changes in future (2031–2050 versus 1995–2014) CFHEs and the resulting population exposure in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) due to non-methane SLCF reductions. We used multi-model ensemble simulations under two future scenarios from the Aerosol and Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project (AerChemMIP) in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). The two future scenarios share the same greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions but have weak (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 3-7.0) versus strong (SSP3-7.0-lowNTCF) levels of air quality control measures. The results show that future non-methane SLCF reductions during 2031–2050 results in about a 7.3% ± 2.3% increase in grid exposure to CFHEs in the NH relative to the period 1995–2014. The frequency, intensity, and duration of CFHEs increase by varying degrees. During the period 2031–2050, the frequency of CFHEs across the NH increases by 2.9 ± 0.9 events per decade due to non-methane SLCF reductions. The increases in CFHE frequency are more pronounced in East Asia, South Asia, Siberia, and northern and eastern North America. In East and South Asia, the intensities of both heatwaves and floods corresponding to CFHEs increase markedly, where heatwave magnitude (HWM) increases by 0.3 ± 0.2 in East Asia and weighted average precipitation (WAP) increases by 18.3% ± 15.3% and 12.0% ± 4.5% in East Asia and South Asia, respectively. In other regions, rising temperatures dominate the increase in CFHEs. With regard to the duration of CFHEs, future reductions in non-methane SLCFs increases the duration of CFHEs in the NH by 0.3 ± 0.1 d. Regionally, the sensitivity of CFHE frequency to global warming caused by non-methane SLCF mitigation is 1.2–1.9 times higher than that caused by GHG forcing. Non-methane SLCFs results in NH-averaged increases in population exposure to CFHEs of (5.0 ± 2.0) × 105 person event in the period 2031–2050. This study emphasizes the importance of considering the impacts of cleaner air in future responses to compound extremes and corresponding societal planning.",

External force and dynamic analyses based on tide gauges, satellite observations, reanalysis data and regional numerical outputs were conducted to understand these abnormally high sea levels and determine their possible causes. Results show that the coastal sea level of China had increased at an annual rate of 3.4 ± 0.3 mm during 1980–2021, with an acceleration of 0.06 ± 0.02 mm per year2. The superposition of significant oscillations of quasi-2, 3–7, quasi-9, quasi-11, quasi-19 and 20‒30 years contributed to the anomalously high sea levels. The negative-phased El Niño/Southern Oscillation was correlated with the anomalously high sea level and the north‒south anti-phase pattern of the coastal sea level in 2021. Meanwhile, phase lags of 1–4 months occurred with the sea-level response. On a decadal timescale, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) was negatively correlated with the anomalous mean sea level (MSL), and the negative-phased PDO contributed to the anomalous sea-level change in 2021. Particularly, the monthly MSL peaked in April and July, and the contribution of wind stress to the anomalously high sea level was 38.5% in the south of the Taiwan Strait in April and 30% along the coast of China in July. These results were consistent with the tide gauge and satellite data. Close agreement was also observed between the coastal sea-level fingerprint and the air and sea surface temperatures.",

Glaciers in the Qilian Mountains are crucial for the development of oases in the Hexi Corridor; however, their area has decreased by more than 20% over the past half-century. Thus, this study developed a dynamic deposition model for light-absorbing particles (LAPs), coupled with a surface energy and mass balance model. We comprehensively assessed the effects of BC and warming on the melting of a typical glacier in the Qilian Mountains based on the coupled model. BC on the glacier surface caused 13.1% of annual glacier-wide melting, of which directly deposited atmospheric BC reduced the surface albedo by 0.02 and accounted for 9.1% of glacier melting. The air temperature during 2000–2010 has increased by 1.5 °C relative to that during the 1950s, accounting for 51.9% of current glacier melting. Meanwhile, BC emission have increased by 4.6 times compared to those of the early Industrial Revolution recorded in an ice core, accounting conservatively for 6.3% of current glacier melting. Mitigating BC emissions has a limited influence on current glacier melting; however, in the long-term, mitigation should exert a noteworthy impact on glacier melting through the self-purification of glaciers.",

    "abstract": "Antarctic trace metal records provide important information for grasping the influence of human activities on the environment over the last centuries. The CA2016-75 ice core is located along the East Antarctic Zhongshan Station–Dome A, enhances the record of metals research in the East Antarctic region, and its high-resolution supplies data support for the study of high-frequency climatic drivers and the effect of human activities on the Antarctic environment. A thorough dataset on seven trace metals (Al, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Ba and Pb) in a coastal ice core in eastern Antarctica during the previous 102 years (1915–2016) is presented in this study. Pb has the lowest concentration (9.51 ± 20.95 pg g−1), and Ba has the highest concentration (36.57 ± 51.35 ng g−1). Notable variations are observed between the pre-1968 AD and post-1968 AD phases for Mn, Zn and Ba. The abrupt, remarkable increase in the concentrations coincided with the change of metal smelting production in the southern hemisphere. In addition to this, it may also be related to local Antarctic scientific research activities. Al and Fe, the primary crustal elements, are essentially obtained from soil dust; Cu shows high crustal enrichment factors (EFc, >10), indicating that it is notably affected by anthropogenic activities. Moreover, the anthropogenic activities in the Southern Hemisphere have had an impact on lead deposition in Antarctica. This study not only enriches the trace metal historical record along the Zhongshan Station–Dome A but also provides a high-resolution ice core record, which is very crucial for the reconstruction of trace metal concentration changes in the last 100 years.",

Two temperature indicators (monthly mean and monthly maximum mean) and three precipitation indicators (monthly total, monthly maximum consecutive 5-day precipitation, and monthly dry days) are analyzed. Tendencies in all five indicators can be observed. Many stations show significant positive trends (above the 90% confidence level) for monthly mean temperatures and monthly maximum mean temperatures. For all months, a significant increase in temperature from 1961 to 2007 can be observed in the entire basin with the coastal area in particular. Positive trends of precipitation extremes can be observed from January to March. Negative trends are detected from September to November. The number of dry days in October increased significantly at 40% of all meteorological stations. Stations with changes of monthly precipitation extremes are scattered over the Zhujiang River Basin. An aggregation of heat waves and droughts can be detected which is accompanied by significant increases of temperature extremes and the negative tendencies in precipitation extremes.

    "abstract": "The annual and seasonal trends in pan evaporation in the lower Yellow River Basin based on quality-controlled data from 10 meteorological stations in 1961–2010 are analyzed. The causes for the changes in annual and seasonal pan evaporation are also discussed. The results suggest that, despite the 1.15°C increasing in annual mean surface air temperature over the past 50 years (0.23°C per decade), the annual pan evaporation has steadily declined by an average rate of −7.65 mm per year. By comparison, this change is greater than those previously reported in China. Significant decreasing trends in annual pan evaporation have been observed at almost all stations. As a whole, seasonal pan evaporation decreased significantly, especially in summer, whereas seasonal temperature increased significantly, except in summer. Thus, the pan evaporation paradox exists in the lower Yellow River Basin. The trend analysis of other meteorological factors indicates significant decrease in sunshine duration and wind speed, but no significant variations in precipitation and relative humidity at annual and seasonal time scales. By examining the relationship between precipitation and pan evaporation, it did not show a concurrent decrease in pan evaporation and increase in precipitation. The partial correlation analysis discovered that the primary cause of decrease in annual and seasonal pan evaporation is the decrease in wind speed. A further examination using a stepwise regression shows that decrease in wind speed and sunshine duration, and increase in mean temperature are likely to be the main meteorological factors affecting the annual and seasonal pan evaporation in the lower Yellow River Basin over the past 50 years.

Thirty Chinese provinces are classified into six groups based on economy, emissions, and reduction potential indicators. Under the equity principle, the two most developed groups are assigned the highest reduction targets (55% and 65%, respectively). However, their reduction potential is limited. Under the efficiency principle, the two groups with the highest reduction potential take the highest targets (48% and 61%, respectively), but their economy is relatively backward. When equity and efficiency are equally weighted, the 5th group with a prominent reduction potential takes the highest target (54%), and the 2nd and the 3rd groups with large industry scales take the second highest target (49%). However, under all the three allocation schemes, the targets are not greater than 40% for the 4th and the 6th groups, which have a relatively low economic ability, emissions, and reduction potential. Due to inconsistency between economic and reduction potential, corresponding market mechanisms and policy instruments should be established to ensure equity and efficiency of regional target allocation.

These series of workshops and conferences on climate models investigated several key issues on advances in determining the reliability of future climate change projections.

    "abstract": "In the U.S. Southwest, global climate change, acting in concert with extant stressors such as urbanization and over-allocation of water resources, is changing ecosystems in measureable and sometimes dramatic ways. Twenty-first century projections indicate accelerating climate change and cascading ecological consequences. Effects observed to date include large-scale forest dieback, large and severe wildfires, and changes in the flow regimes of rivers and streams with attendant changes to riparian and aquatic ecosystems. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are pushing ecosystems across physiological and ecological thresholds, causing widespread mortality and, in some cases, major changes in composition, structure and function. These changes have prompted action by the conservation community to reduce the adverse effects of climate change. The Southwest Climate Change Initiative (SWCCI), a project led by The Nature Conservancy, works with local stakeholders in affected landscapes, reduces adverse impacts on ecological and social systems using scientific knowledge and practical tools. The Initiative has learned through practical experience that: 1) managers must embrace change and manage for resilience rather than resistance; 2) strong local science-management partnerships are critical to effective adaptation planning and implementation; 3) planners and managers must broaden the scope and accelerate the pace of conservation activities if ecosystem services are to be sustained; 4) adaptation often does not require radically new or different management practices, rather, conservationists already have many of the tools they need; and 5) rapid documentation and widespread communication of methods and findings can build rapidly regional capacity for climate change adaptation. Our experience suggests that adaptation efforts can be effective if they are focused at the local scale; employ learning networks; and engage in ecosystem-based adaptation: the sustainable management, conservation and restoration of ecosystems so that they continue to provide the services that allow people to thrive in changing environments.

    "abstract": "In Central China, the obvious climate change has happened along with global warming. Based on the observational analysis, the climate change has significant effects, both positive and negative, in every field within the study area, and with the harmful effects far more prevalent. Under the scenario A1B, it is reported that temperature, precipitation, days of heat waves and extreme precipitation intensity will increase at respective rates of 0.38°C per decade, 12.6 mm per decade, 6.4 d and 47 mm per decade in the 21st century. It is widely believed that these climate changes in the future will result in some apparent impacts on agro-ecosystems, water resources, wetland ecosystem, forest ecosystem, human health, energy sectors and other sensitive fields in Central China. Due to the limited scientific knowledge and researches, there are still some shortages in the climate change assessment methodologies and many uncertainties in the climate prediction results. Therefore, it is urgent and essential to increase the studies of the regional climate change adaptation, extend the research fields, and enhance the studies in the extreme weather and climate events to reduce the uncertainties of the climate change assessments.

    "abstract": "The necessity of mainstreaming climate adaptation strategies or policies into natural resource management plans has been recognized by the UNFCCC. The IPCC AR5 report suggests a growing demand for research to provide information for a deeper and more useful understanding of climate adaptation options, and indicates a lack of effective methods to meet this increasing demand of policymakers. In this respect, a participatory integrated assessment (PIA) approach is presented in this paper to provide an effective means to mainstream wetland climate change adaptation in rural sustainable development strategies, and thus to reduce climate vulnerability and to enhance rural community livelihood. The PIA approach includes a series of research activities required to assess climate impacts on wetland ecosystems, and to prioritize adaptation responses. A range of adaptation options that address key aspects of the wetland ecosystem resilience and concerns are evaluated against community based on sustainable development indicators. The PIA approach is able to identify desirable adaptation options which can then be implemented to improve wetland ecosystem health and to enhance regional sustainable development in a changing climate. For illustration purpose, the PIA was applied in a case study in Poyang Lake (PYL) region, a critical wetland and water ecosystem in central China with important international biodiversity linkages, and a locale for key policy experiments with ecosystem rehabilitation. The PIA was used to facilitate the integration of wetland climate change adaptation in rural sustainable development actions with multi-stakeholders participation. In particular, the case shows how the PIA can be designed and implemented to select effective and practical climate change adaptation options to enhance ecosystem services management and to reduce resource use conflicts and rural poverty. Worked in partnership with multi-stakeholders and assisted with a multi-criteria decision making tool, the case identified alternative desirable adaptation measures which could be used to deal with climate risks. Several desirable adaptation options were implemented as pilot projects to showcase the effectiveness of these measures which resulted in benefits to the well-being and productivity of all people living in the region. It should be noted that while the case study evaluated adaptation policies or options to climate change, it was not completed in terms of discussing in detail all the key components of the PIA approach. However, the case study represents the state-of-the-arts research in climate change impact assessment and adaptation option evaluation, particularly in linking with wetland ecosystem sustainability. Findings of the case study have indicated that the potential effects of climate change on wetland sustainability are quite significant. The case has also identified adaptation measures considered by stakeholders to be potentially effective for reducing vulnerability of wetland ecosystems. It is clear that wetland ecosystem sustainability goals will be unachievable without mainstreaming adaptation measures into wetland conservation and health programs under a changing climate.",

The ERF of methane from 1750 to 2011 was 0.46 W m−2 by taking it as a well-mixed greenhouse gas, and the inhomogeneity of methane increased its ERF by about 0.02 W m−2. The change of methane concentration since pre-industrial led to an increase of 0.31 °C in global mean surface air temperature and 0.02 mm d−1 in global mean precipitation. The warming was prominent over the middle and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere (with a maximum increase exceeding 1.4 °C). The precipitation notably increased (maximum increase of 1.8 mm d−1) over the ocean between 10°N and 20°N and significantly decreased (maximum decrease >–0.6 mm d−1) between 10°S and 10°N. These changes caused a northward movement of precipitation cell in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Cloud cover significantly increased (by approximately 4%) in the high latitudes in both hemispheres, and sharply decreased (by approximately 3%) in tropical areas.",

    "abstract": "Arctic is warming at an alarming speed causing accelerated melting of Greenland and rising of sea level, and geoengineering by injecting aerosol into stratosphere (SAI) has been proposed as a backup approach to mitigate warming. However, studies suggest that SAI implementation may have adverse impacts on global especially monsoon precipitation, and Northern Hemisphere high-latitude injections may have disproportionally high effects than tropical injections. The 1783–1784 CE Laki eruption in Iceland provides an analogy to study the climatic and the subsequent socioecological responses to Arctic SAI, and China possesses a rich legacy of documents recording climatic disasters and describing their direct impacts on agriculture and society. Using the most recent summer precipitation reconstructions and the documentary data, this study presents a systemic analysis of the hydroclimatic anomalies as well as the societal and ecological consequences in China following the 1783–1784 CE Laki eruption. The results from multi-proxies show severe drought conditions in eastern China during the post-Laki years, accompanied by large scale locust breakout, famine and human pestilence. The drought and associated disasters first emerged in the North China Plain in 1784 CE, intensified and expanded to the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in 1785 CE. The drought and famine stresses in China are part of the very unsettled climate conditions experienced across the Northern Hemispheric world during the 1780s. By isolating the ENSO-induced precipitation from the reconstructed summer precipitation changes, our results indicate that the Laki eruption did cause severe drought in monsoon China during the next three years. The drought responses in the 1783–1784 were largely counter-balanced by the wetting induced by the concurring strong El Niño event. The results help to enhance our understanding of the hydroclimate consequence of NH high latitude volcanic eruption in China, and the potential role climate internal variation such as ENSO may play in modifying volcanic-induced perturbation.",

    "abstract": "Climate change could intensify extreme weather events, such as flooding, which amplifies the public health threat of waterborne diseases. Thus, assessing health vulnerability and adaptation (V&A) could facilitate nationally effective responses to extreme climate events. However, related studies are still negligible, and the assessment urgently needs to be validated with actual health data after extreme weather events. We established health V&A indices through literature review and factor analyses. Then, we separately mapped the spatial distribution of flood exposure, social and public health sensitivity, and adaptive capacity before the 2016 flood in Anhui province and compared it with post-flood diarrhea risks by using the geographic information system method to assess health vulnerability. Finally, we validated the indices by exploring the relationship between health V&A indices and post-flood diarrhea risks by using the quantile regression model. Results revealed that health V&A can be framed and categorized as key components of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. The remarkable differences in the spatial distribution of health vulnerability were generally consistent with the demographic sensitivity, geographic flooding exposure, and post-flood diarrhea risks in Anhui. In addition, health V&A indices exerted significant positive impacts on infectious diarrhea post-flooding at all quantiles and were significant across different percentiles. Moreover, the impacts of flood exposure on total infectious diarrhea were high and continuous, whereas the impacts of sensitivity were not obvious in the flood's early stage (Coeff = 0.643; p < 0.001) but high in the flood's middle (Coeff = 0.997; p < 0.001) and late stages (Coeff = 0.975; p < 0.001). However, the impacts of adaptive capacity were heterogeneous and high in the flood's early stage (Coeff = 0.665; p < 0.001 at the 25th percentile) and late stage (Coeff = 1.296; p < 0.001 at the 75th percentile) but were insignificant at the 50th percentile. This study contributed validated three-layered health V&A indices with 30 indicators and identified that the impacts of the key components on post-flood waterborne-disease risks are heterogeneous. For instance, local public health sensitivity and adaptive capacity are insufficient to reduce these risks in the long run. This study could be used to project population health risks after extreme weather events and thereby contributes to local government planning of health adaptation.",

It is imperative to quantitatively estimate the value of freshwater provisioning services to facilitate informed decision-making for ecosystem management and economic development. This study assessed the economic value and associated changes in benefits of freshwater provisioning services for industrial, agricultural, services and domestic water uses combining cost-based method and hydrological model in the Urumqi River during 2010–2016. The results showed that the average annual economic value of agricultural, services, domestic and industrial water uses generated from freshwater provisioning services were estimated to be 1.7, 4.4, 9.9, and 15.7 million CNY. The annual value of snowmelt provisioning services of sectorial water uses was much higher than that of glacier meltwater due to the greater contribution of snowmelt to outlet streamflow than glacier melt. The relative contributions of agricultural, services, domestic and industrial sectors to total economic value of freshwater provisioning services were 6%, 13%, 32%, and 49% respectively, depending on the meltwater supply and market prices. The benefits of freshwater provisioning services from different sectors generally increased in 2010–2016, with a significant increase in the services sector. Considering the impact of changes in freshwater supply under climate change on the assessment of cryospheric provisioning services, the results emphasize the necessity of promoting industrial structure optimization and adopting resource-efficient policies.",

It was found that about 0.004% and 0.07% of the total ammonium loads were emitted as N2O, CH4 emissions were 0.026% and 0.12% of incoming TOC (0.008% and 0.04% of incoming COD) in 2014 and 2018. The obtained N2O emission values were relatively low. The study suggested that a high aeration at the beginning of the treatment line may result in significantly high emissions of both N2O and CH4. A significant change in aeration in the membrane ultrafiltration tank did not have the same impact. The MBR process is known for high quality effluent but have been questioned due to its higher carbon footprint due to energy consumption. This study gave a reference case about direct GHG emissions from MBR process and provide information for the further evaluation of MBR processes.",

As a crucial way to ensure the sustainable development of the ski industry, snow storage has been gradually studied and applied in Europe. Covering thermal insulation materials is a key engineering measure for the success of snow storage. This study used numerical methods rather than an experimental method to evaluate the thermal insulation performance of nine snow storage coverage schemes in Harbin, Beijing, and Altay, China. We investigated the thermal insulation performance of nine snow storage coverage schemes (three natural materials and six artificial ones) using a solar radiation method and an implicit finite difference method. Sensitivity analyses were conducted, and the cost performance of schemes 5–9 were analyzed. Based on the cost and thermal insulation performance, we used schemes 4 (geotextile, straw bale), 5 (geotextile, extruded polystyrene foam), and 7 (geotextile, polyurethane foam) to evaluate the snow storage effects in Harbin, Beijing, and Altay. Results showed that among schemes 1–9, scheme 7 has the best thermal insulation performance. If natural materials are used, then scheme 3 gives the best thermal insulation performance. Among schemes 5–9, scheme 5 is the most economical. The heat transfer in Beijing is higher than that in Harbin and Altay, while the latter two show similar heat transfers. The combination of meteorological conditions and coverage schemes influence the melting rate of snowpacks. The melting rate of snowpacks can be reduced with an optimized coverage scheme. The proposed methods can serve the selection of coverage schemes for snow storage.",

    "abstract": "One of the key issues in climate risk management is to develop climate resilient infrastructure so as to ensure safety and sustainability of urban functioning systems as well as mitigate the adverse impacts associated with increasing climate hazards. However, conventional methods of assessing risks do not fully address the interaction of various subsystems within the city system and are unable to consolidate diverse opinions of various stakeholders on their assessments of sector-specific risks posed by climate change. To address this gap, this study advances an integrated-systems-analysis tool - Climate Risk Assessment of Infrastructure Tool (CRAIT), and applies it to analyze and compare the extent of risk factor exposure and vulnerability over time across five critical urban infrastructure sectors in Shanghai and Shenzhen, two cities that have distinctive geo-climate profiles and histories of infrastructure development. The results show significantly higher level of variation between the two cities in terms of vulnerability levels than that of exposure. More specifically, the sectors of critical buildings, water, energy, and information & communication in Shenzhen have significantly higher vulnerability levels than Shanghai in both the 2000s and the 2050s. We further discussed the vulnerability levels of subsystems in each sector and proposed twelve potential adaptation options for the roads system based on four sets of criteria: technical feasibility, flexibility, co-benefits, and policy compatibility. The application of CRAIT is bound to be a knowledge co-production process with the local experts and stakeholders. This knowledge co-production process highlights the importance of management advancements and nature-based green solutions in managing climate change risk in the future though differences are observed across the efficacy categories due to the geographical and meteorological conditions in the two cities. This study demonstrates that this knowledge co-creation process is valuable in facilitating policymakers' decision-making and their feedback to scientific understanding in climate risk assessment, and that this approach has general applicability for cities in other regions and countries.",

The present work established a set of homogenised monthly and daily surface air temperature (SAT) series during 1873–2019 at XJH. Two major inhomogeneous break points (around 1954 and 1993) were identified in the original SAT series, which had been overlooked in previous works. The inhomogeneous biases were adjusted via the inter-station deviation analysis. The adjusted SAT series shows a warming trend of 1.9 °C per century compared with 1.7 °C per century in the original series. The multi-decadal variations of quasi-32-year and quasi-64-year periods are weaker in the adjusted series than in the original series, suggesting overestimated multi-decadal variability in the original data due to inhomogeneous biases. Relative to the early period 1873–1900, the recent decade (the 2010s) is warmer by 2.2 °C. Urbanisation has been responsible for approximately 19.3% of the rapid warming since the 1980s. The high and low SAT extremes exhibit significant warming, especially after the 1970s. The trend in the low SAT extremes in the adjusted series is substantially larger than that in the original series, implying that previous studies might underestimate the warming in cold extremes.",

    "abstract": "Understanding mitigation ambitions of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) should include both the equity of supporting the Paris Agreement goals and the costs of achieving the proposed mitigation targets. This study presents a new framework that combines equity and economic costs to compare and analyze mitigation ambitions of Parties' updated NDCs. Under representative 2 °C and 1.5 °C pathways, this framework uses multiple equity-principled allocations to derive the alignment of the updated NDCs with the Paris Agreement goals, and further applies a computable general equilibrium model to assess the economic costs of implementing the updated NDCs. The results show that global 2030 emissions may meet the selected global 2 °C pathway if all Parties achieve their most ambitious mitigation efforts, but there is still an emissions gap of 10–15 GtCO2 to follow the selected 1.5 °C pathway. From the perspective of equity, the updated NDCs of the USA, the EU (including the UK in this study), and Japan lack ambition with respect to 'equal cumulative per capita emissions' under 2 °C and do not align with any equity principles under 1.5 °C. The updated NDCs of China, India, Brazil and South Africa reflect their claims to 'equity' and 'common but differentiated responsibilities'. From the perspective of economic costs, the GDP and welfare losses of China, Brazil and South Africa incurred by achieving the updated NDCs are not lower than those of the three developed Parties. China's GDP loss is estimated at 0.43%–0.55% in 2030, which is higher than that of the USA (0.30%–0.38%) and the EU (0.25%–0.28%). This study suggests that developed Parties take the lead in further ratcheting up the NDCs and strengthen financial and technological support to developing countries so that the world could close the gap to 1.5 °C.",

    "abstract": "An extremely heavy rainfall cluster was observed over the middle reaches of the Yangtze River (MYR) in August 2021, breaking the historical record since 1981 and causing severe floods. The controlling circulation regime and possible predictability sources of the un-expected rainfall are still unclear, especially from a sub-seasonal perspective. Our results show that the successive heavy rainfall events in August 2021 had significant intraseasonal oscillations for 10–24 d and 30–60 d, and they were synergistically influenced by tropical and extra-tropical circulation regime. Above all, the East Asia–Pacific teleconnection pattern (EAP) turned into a negative phase in late July and maintained throughout August, providing favorable background conditions for the northward transport of tropical water vapor and the southward intrusion of cold air from mid-high latitudes. The 30–60-d oscillation of precipitation was dominated by the first mode of boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation (BSISO1, with 30–60-d period), which strengthened the tropical moisture transport, while the quasi-biweekly oscillation of the western Pacific subtropical high and the anomalous mid-latitude cyclone of EAP intensified the precipitation on the scale of 10–24 d. In addition, the second mode of BSISO (BSISO2, with 10–30-d period) may also intensify the 10–24-d precipitation in late August. The forecast leading time of the S2S models for the persistent heavy rainfall in August 2021 was basically 1–2 weeks, while the EAP and BSISO1 were revealed as the main predictable sources of the abnormal rainfall events. These results highlight the importance of superposition of different intraseasonal oscillations in forming the extreme rainfall event and demonstrate a potential chance to enhance the prediction skill of extreme event if the ensemble members in S2S models could be reasonably selected according to their performances on key predictability sources.",

The impact of precipitation on the urban traffic flow, especially the different impacts among cities and areas within a city, is worth investigating. Here, we analysed the impact of precipitation on the traffic flow in the urban areas of the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region by comparing the traffic flow in non-precipitation and rainy weather with different hourly precipitation intensities in 2021. The increase in the travel time index (TTI) is chosen to represent the influence of precipitation on the transportation system. The results show that the maximum of the average TTI increases on the city scale under various rainfall intensities by 3.3%, 6.6% and 10.8% in Beijing, Tianjin and Shijiazhuang, respectively. In general, the increase in the TTI contributed by precipitation is the greatest at morning and afternoon peak hours, and the traffic congestion degree increases with the rainfall intensity. However, in the morning peak, afternoon peak and midday hours in Beijing and Tianjin, the influences of the weak rainfall intensity on the traffic flow are generally great, whereas the traffic congestion degree caused by heavy precipitation is relatively low. Particularly, in morning peak hours, the congestion reduction reaches approximately 2%, which may be related to the spatial difference in the impacts of precipitation on the traffic flow and the changes in people's travel intention under different rainfall intensities. The findings can help better understand the relationship between rainfall and urban traffic flow characteristics and also potentially contribute to the development of impact-oriented climate predictions.",

    "abstract": "The Yangtze River Delta characterized by a dense population and a rapidly developing economy is highly vulnerable to sea-level rise. The data from the China Oceanic Information Network and the Zhejiang Provincial Hydrology Bureau are used to analyze sea-level rise. The rate of sea-level rise in the delta was 2.4 mm per year in 1981–2015. The annual sea-level at Daishan, Dinghai, and Dongtou stations in the south wing of the delta were 4.3, 3.1, and 5 mm per year respectively over the same period. The 10-year averaged results at each station also indicate a perceptible trend of sea-level rise. Sea-level rise is contributed to a larger proportion of intensified erosion, ranging from 3% to 14% in the delta. Meanwhile, the 100-year return period of tidal level has decreased to the 50-year rank at Dongtou and Dinghai stations. Moreover, the arrival time of tidal bores at Yanguan is 4 min earlier under sea-level rise of 0.145 m than that of 0 m. The height of tidal bores and the velocities at the surface and bottom layers have an increase under sea-level rise. The maximum increases of high and low tide levels are 0.122 m and 0.016 m while the maximum increases of the velocities at the surface and bottom layers are 0.07 m s−1 and 0.05 m s−1, respectively. Sea-level rise will bring about the damage of seawall, thus the design standard of constructing seawalls should adopt a higher level to minimize the associated risks in the Yangtze River Delta and its south wing.",

The results indicate that from 1961 to 2010 the annual and seasonal mean temperatures in the entire Xinjiang show an increasing trend with the increasing rate rising from south to north. The increasing rate of annual mean minimum temperature is over twice more than that of the annual mean maximum temperature, contributing much to the increase in the annual averages. The magnitude of the decrease rate of low-temperature days is larger than the increase rate of high-temperature days. The increase of warm days and warm nights and the decrease of cold days and cold nights further reveal that the temperature increasing in Xinjiang is higher. In addition, annual and seasonal rainfalls have been increasing. South Xinjiang experiences higher increase in rainfall amounts than North Xinjiang and Tianshan Mountains. Annual rainy days, longest consecutive rainy days, the daily maximum precipitation and extreme precipitation events, annual torrential rain days and amount, annual blizzard days and amount, all show an increasing trend, corresponding to the increasing in annual mean water vapor pressure. This result shows that the humidity has increased with temperature increasing in the past 50 years. The decrease in annual mean wind speed and gale days lessen the impact of dust storm, sandstorm, and floating dust events. The increase in annual rainy days is the cause of the decrease in annual sunshine duration, while the increase in spring sunshine duration corresponds with the decrease in dust weather. Therefore, the increase in precipitation indicators, the decrease in gales and dust weather, and the increasing in sunshine duration in spring will be beneficial to crops growth. Jiang, Y.-A., Y.

    "abstract": "Daily climate data at 110 stations during 1961–2010 were selected to examine the changing characteristics of climate factors and extreme climate events in South China. The annual mean surface air temperature has increased significantly by 0.16°C per decade, most notably in the Pearl River Delta and in winter. The increase rate of the annual extreme minimum temperature (0.48°C per decade) is over twice that of the annual extreme maximum temperature (0.20°C per decade), and the increase of the mean temperature is mainly the result of the increase of the extreme minimum temperature. The increase rate of high-temperature days (1.1 d per decade) is close to the decrease rate of low-temperature days (–1.3 d per decade). The rainfall has not shown any significant trend, but the number of rainy days has decreased and the rain intensity has increased. The regional mean sunshine duration has a significant decreasing trend of –40.9 h per decade, and the number of hazy days has a significant increasing trend of 6.3 d per decade. The decrease of sunshine duration is mainly caused by the increase of total cloud, not by the increase of hazy days in South China. Both the regional mean pan evaporation and mean wind speed have significant decreasing trends of –65.9 mm per decade and –0.11 m s−1 per decade, respectively. The decrease of both sunshine duration and mean wind speed plays an important role in the decrease of pan evaporation. The number of landing tropical cyclones has an insignificant decreasing trend of –0.6 per decade, but their intensities show a weak increasing trend. The formation location of tropical cyclones landing in South China has converged towards 10–19°N, and the landing position has shown a northward trend. The date of the first landfall tropical cyclone postpones 1.8 d per decade, and the date of the last landfall advances 3.6 d per decade, resulting in reduction of the typhoon season by 5.4 d per decade.

The Working Group (WG) Reports and Synthesis Report of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) will be completed in 2013/2014. In order to address climate change, China Meteorological Administration (CMA) has launched climate change assessment reports since August 2008 for East China, South China, Central China, North China, Northeast China, Northwest China, Southwest China, and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. This is the first effort addressing climate change at a regional scale in China and among the first efforts globally. In order to ensure the quality of the report, CMA has organized hundreds of experts from CMA, colleges and universities, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and used a workflow similar to that of the IPCC AR5. The methods of field observation, data analysis, forecasting models and literature review have been used in these reports. Until now, eight regional assessment reports are being published. This journal will continuously publish the studies in three repeating sessions: climate change facts, impact assessment and adaptation, and mitigation, in order to provide the readers with this reference.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Paris Agreement introduced a 1.5 °C target to control the rise in global temperature, but clear arrangements for feasible implementation pathways were not made. Achieving the 1.5 °C target imposes high requirements on global emission reduction. Nationally Determined Contributions of all Parties are far from the 1.5 °C target, and conventional emission reduction technologies and policies will also have difficulty in fulfilling this task. In this context, geoengineering is gaining interest in the international arena. The Paris Agreement includes afforestation, carbon capture, utilization and storage, and negative emission technologies such as bio-energy with carbon capture and store. All of these techniques are CO 2 removal technologies that belong to geoengineering. Solar radiation management, which is highly controversial, has also attracted increased attention in recent years. Although the outline of the IPCC Special Report on 1.5 °C does not include a specific section on geoengineering issues yet, geoengineering is an unconventional technical option that cannot be avoided in research and discussions on impact assessment, technical options, ethics, and international governance under the 1.5 °C target. On the basis of analyzing and discussing abovementioned issues, this paper proposes several policy suggestions for China to strengthen research on and response to geoengineering.",

    "abstract": "Carbon emissions and water use are two major kinds of human activities. To reveal whether these two activities can modify the hydrological cycle and climate system in China, we conducted two sets of numerical experiments using regional climate model RegCM4. In the first experiment used to study the climatic responses to human carbon emissions, the model were configured over entire China because the impacts of carbon emissions can be detected across the whole country. Results from the first experiment revealed that near-surface air temperature may significantly increase from 2007 to 2059 at a rate exceeding 0.1 °C per decade in most areas across the country; southwestern and southeastern China also showed increasing trends in summer precipitation, with rates exceeding 10 mm per decade over the same period. In summer, only northern China showed an increasing trend of evapotranspiration, with increase rates ranging from 1 to 5 mm per decade; in winter, increase rates ranging from 1 to 5 mm per decade were observed in most regions. These effects are believed to be caused by global warming from human carbon emissions. In the second experiment used to study the effects of human water use, the model were configured over a limited region—Haihe River Basin in the northern China, because compared with the human carbon emissions, the effects of human water use are much more local and regional, and the Haihe River Basin is the most typical region in China that suffers from both intensive human groundwater exploitation and surface water diversion. We incorporated a scheme of human water regulation into RegCM4 and conducted the second experiment. Model outputs showed that the groundwater table severely declined by ∼10 m in 1971–2000 through human groundwater over-exploitation in the basin; in fact, current conditions are so extreme that even reducing the pumping rate by half cannot eliminate the groundwater depletion cones observed in the area. Other hydrological and climatic elements, such as soil moisture, runoff generation, air humidity, precipitation, wind field, and soil and air temperature, were also significantly affected by anthropogenic water withdrawal and consumption, although these effects could be mitigated by reducing the amount of water drawn for extraction and application.",

The results indicate that the growth of winter wheat would be strongly influenced by climate change in future. The average flowering and maturity dates of winter wheat would advance by 26 and 27 days under scenario A2, and by 23 and 24 days respectively under scenario A1B from 2012 to 2100. The simulated potential productivity of winter wheat shows a decrease of 14.3% and 12.5% for scenarios A2 and A1B respectively without the fertilization effect of CO2, while an increase of 1.3% and 0.6% with the fertilization effect of CO2. Additionally, for northern China, the simulated potential productivity would markedly decrease under both scenarios, independent with the fertilization effect of CO2, which indicates that the current planted winter wheat would be more vulnerable than that in southern China. The most likely reason is the current winter wheat varieties in northern China are winter varieties or strong winter varieties, which need some days of low temperature for dormancy. While in southern China, the winter wheat is spring or half winter varieties and can grow slowly during winter, thus, they would be affected slightly when winter temperature increases. The results of this study may have important implications for adaptation measures. Song, Y.-L., D.-L. Chen, Y.-J.

The results show that the CTH in East Asia was higher in the southwest and lower in the northeast. The annual mean CTH was found to increase in East Asia at the rate of 0.020 km per year, of which, 0.035 km per year over the eastern land and 0.034 km per year over the eastern sea. The CTH changes statistically correlated with the sea surface temperature changes over the eastern sea (r = 0.68), which indicates that the CTH changes may be affected by the underlying surface. Statistically significant increasing trend of annual mean CTH was found in the latitude zone of 30°–40°N. Furthermore, CTH showed decreasing trends of about −0.030 km per year in the Middle-Lower Yangtze River Basin, Tarim Basin, Turpan Basin and northeastern Sichuan Basin in summer since more low cloud formations benefited to the decrease of CTH. In winter, the decreasing trend of CTH was found over the north of 40°N, whereas the increasing trend was found over the south of 40°N in East Asia.",

    "abstract": "Rural communities in the Koshi River basin, a trans-boundary river basin in the Hindu Kush-Himalayas, have been experiencing unprecedented difficulties for adapting with the livelihood challenges arising from floods, droughts and other climatic, environmental and socio-economic stresses. The single purpose adaptation approach often fails to address the multiple challenges arises from cascading effects of climate change at different scales and stages. To fill this gap, we developed a multi-dimensional flexible adaptation framework looking at the four dimensions of adaptation, structure, issue, time, and space (SITS). The SITS framework provides a comprehensive approach for cascading adaptation at trans-boundary river basin level and it could effectively enhance the adaptive capacity and transform livelihood outcome if properly implemented. Following the SITS framework, we examined four cascading adaptation pathways for: i) reducing disaster stressors on livelihoods, ii) enhancing access to crucial livelihood capitals, iii) improving equal rights to livelihood, and iv) strengthening synergies and exploiting complementarities at trans-boundary river basin level. The findings revealed that in the context of changing climate, it is necessary to employ different livelihood adaptation strategies and multiple responses simultaneously or sequentially to successfully adapt to the cascading effects of changing climate. The cascading adaptation may provide a sound basis on which to cope with the climate uncertainty through realistic scenarios of structure, issue, time and space. Its implementation, however, has several obstacles, for example, differences in national system, investment capacity, complexity of trans-boundary basin, remained particularly in trans-boundary river basin where managing transnational trade-offs and harness spatial synergies are critically important.",

These considerations are scientifically well studied and led to the development of a complex policy framework for adaptation and mitigation for hydrometeorological risks. Awareness for policy actions is growing worldwide but no legal framework is in place to tackle climate change impacts on water at a global scale. With the example of international frameworks and the legislation on EU-level, this article elaborates that hydrometeorological risks are not considered in the framework of one single policy. However, various policy instruments are directly or indirectly considering these risks at different operational levels. It is discussed that a tailor-made framework for hydrometeorological risks would improve coordination at international or national level. A major drawback for a single operational framework is that hydrometeorological risks are scientifically tackled in two large communities: the disaster risk reduction community and the climate change adaptation community, both of which are bound to different research and operational funding budgets. In future, disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation will need been seen as a complementary set of actions that requires collaboration.",

For this purpose, observed precipitation and temperature data (1981–2010) and climate simulations (2021–2050, 2071–2100) at high resolution (about 14 km) on a large part of China are used as weather forcing. The simulated weather forcing has been bias corrected by means of the distribution derived quantile mapping method to eliminate the effects of systematic biases in current climate modeling on water cycle components. As hydrological models, two 1D models are tested: TERRA-ML and HELP. Concerning soil properties, two datasets, provided respectively by Food and Agriculture Organization and U.S. Department of Agriculture, are separately tested. The combination of two hydrological models, two soil parameter datasets and three weather forcing inputs (observations, raw and bias corrected climate simulations) results in five different simulation chains. The study highlights how the choice of some approaches or soil parameterizations can affect the results both in absolute and in relative terms and how these differences could be highly related to weather forcing in inputs or investigated soil. The analyses point out a decrease in average water content in the shallower part of the soil with different extents according to climate zone, concentration scenario and soil/cover features. Moreover, the projected increase in temperature and then in evapotranspirative demand do not ever result in higher actual evapotranspiration values, due to the concurrent variations in precipitation patterns.",

Here, we project the changes of weather conditions conducive to winter haze episodes in Beijing by 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C global warming using Haze Weather Index (HWI) and data of ensemble simulations from the Community Earth System Model (CESM) low-warming experiment. Compared to present day (2006–2015), the frequency in winter season is projected to increase by 14% for regular haze episodes (HWI > 0) and 21% for severe haze episodes (HWI > 1) at the 1.5 °C global warming. Projections shows larger increases of 27% for regular and 18% for severe haze events at the 2 °C global warming. The additional warming of 0.5 °C largely enhances the persistence of weather conditions conducive to haze episodes. The increased temperature contrast between near-surface and mid-troposphere in eastern Asia accounts for 57% and 81% of the change in HWI by 1.5 °C and 2 °C warming, respectively. Considering increased haze weather potential caused by climate warming, we suggest that additional efforts in emission reductions of carbon dioxide and air pollution are necessary to mitigate haze episodes in Beijing.",

The results provide a recent record of rBC deposition in the East Greenland ice sheet from 1990 to 2016. The annual variability in oxygen (δ18O) and hydrogen (δD) isotopic compositions indicated that notably warm events occurred since 2008. Peaks in rBC occurred during summer seasons, which may be attributed to the burning of biomass in boreal summer. The rBC record and analysis of historical air trajectories using the HYSPLIT model indicated that anthropogenic BC emissions from Russia, North America and Europe contributed to the majority of rBC deposition in the Greenland region, and a reduction in anthropogenic BC consumption in these areas played a dominant role in the decrease in BC concentrations since 2000. This record also suggests that the emissions from the East Asian region (China) contributed very little to the recorded BC concentrations in East Greenland ice core. The model results indicated that radiative forcing due to BC had decreased significantly since 1990, and had remained below 0.02 W m−2 since 2000.",

    "abstract": "Most models in the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) underestimate the surface air temperature over China in both winter and summer. Understanding the weather regime in association with the simulated temperature variability is of high interest to get insight into those biases. Based on the weather regime method, we investigated the contributions of large-scale dynamics and non-dynamical processes to temperature biases and inter-model spread. The weather regimes associated with the observational temperature patterns were obtained through a k-means clustering algorithm applied to daily 500 hPa geopotential height anomalies. Here we identified the clustering number of weather regimes using the classifiability and reproducibility indices which can provide the optimal clustering number to obtain objective clustering. Both indices suggested the weather regimes in East Asia can be classified as four clusters in winter (December–January–February) and three in summer (June–July–August). The results indicated that the first and second weather regimes were related to the cold temperature anomalies in China during winter, and the three weather regimes could not effectively classify the temperature patterns during summer. The ensemble mean of 23 CMIP5 models overestimated the occurrence frequencies of the second weather regime, which corresponds to a weaker high latitude westerly jet over East Asia during winter. The 500 hPa geopotential height anomalies and the inter-model spread over the Tibetan Plateau may be associated with the limited ability of the CMIP5 models in simulating the thermal effects of plateau in summer. We also found that the non-dynamical processes had major contribution to the ensemble-mean biases, and the large-scale dynamics played a minor role. The non-dynamical processes substantially affected the inter-model spread, especially over the Tibetan Plateau and the Sichuan Basin, during both winter and summer. The results suggested that improving the simulation of regional processes may help to improve model performance. The use of multi-model mean is recommended since it performs better than most of individual models.",

    "abstract": "As the world seeks to increase ambition rapidly to limit global warming to 1.5 °C, joint leadership from the world's largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters—the United States (U.S.) and China—will be critical to deliver significant emissions reductions from their own countries as well as to catalyze increased international action. After a period of uncertainty in international climate policy, these countries now both have current leadership that supports ambitious climate action. In this context, a feasible, high-impact, and potentially globally catalytic agreement by the U.S. and China to phase out coal would be a major contribution toward this global effort. We undertake a plant-by-plant assessment in the power sector to identify practical pathways for a 2030 coal phaseout in the U.S. and a 2045 coal phaseout in China in line with national priorities and the global 1.5 °C target. We demonstrate that such pathways would also lead to significant emissions reductions, lowering overall global energy-related CO2 emissions by about 9% in 2030 relative to 2020. A catalytic effect from the possibility of other country phaseout commitments is estimated to reduce global emissions by 5.1 Gt CO2 in 2030 and by 10.1 Gt CO2 in 2045. Subnational coal retirement pathways show heavier impacts for certain coal-intensive regions in both countries. Due to substantial variations of the existing coal fleets, the 1.5 °C-compatible pathways will result in an average retirement age of 47 years for the U.S. coal plants but only 22 years for Chinese coal plants.",

    "abstract": "China's energy service demand statistics for the passenger transport sector only cover travel activities for business purpose. The incomplete data have made it very difficult to conduct long-term scenario analysis for this sector. Thus, this study develops a methodology by refining and combining vehicle activity and travel behavior methods. By taking advantage of the two methods, the extent of uncertainty in estimates can be reduced. A detailed description of China's energy service demand in the passenger transport sector for the years 2013, 2015, and 2017 are produced. Results show that there is a significant underestimation of total passenger transport turnover in governmental statistics. After reevaluation, the total passenger turnover doubled and increased by 146%, 167%, and 187%, resulting in national total passenger turnover of 6783, 8031, and 9406 billion passenger kilometers in 2013, 2015, and 2017, respectively. The majority of missing statistics are caused by not accounting for non-operational road transport, which is dominated by private vehicles. After adjustment, the road sector share in total passenger turnover grew substantially from 30% to 40% to approximately 75%, with the proportion of urban travel continuing to increase. We found that without complete data on China's passenger turnover, it may result in more than three-fold overestimation for future travel demand, leading to inaccurate projections with much higher energy consumption and CO2 emissions. It is therefore very important to have a detailed and precise calculation of energy service demand in the passenger transport sector. The estimation framework and step-by-step process can also be applied to other developing countries which are confronting similar statistical issues.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is causing sea-level rise, intense and frequent storm surge flooding, and significant shoreline erosion in Malaysian coastal areas. Consequently, coastal properties, infrastructure, and livelihoods are threatened. It has become apparent that adaptation at the household and community level is necessary to offset the adverse impacts of coastal hazards. The community needs to be made aware of the risks, acquire knowledge about adaptation options, and be empowered to take their own actions. Public perception and preference are therefore crucial for design and implementation of effective planning for climate change. Thus, this study assesses households' perception, adaptation measures and empirically estimates willingness to pay and preference for planned adaptation measures to guide policy instruments through public engagement. In Malaysia, ten highly vulnerable coastal areas in the Selangor coast were surveyed at the household level (n = 1016) through face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. Regarding households' perception and adaptation methods, most of the households in the highly exposed areas perceived less risk of inundation and sea-level rise threat and adopted less proactive adaptation and limited risk reduction behaviours during the extreme event. The study found that 66.9% of households were willing to pay for planned adaptation measures despite the limited income capabilities and in favour of moderate adaptation (23.9%). The binomial and ordinal regression results indicated that the probability of willingness to pay for planned adaptation measures significantly increases with age, prior exposure to coastal hazards, awareness, risk perception, community participation, being affected by property damage and loss of income due to extreme events. With increased monthly household income and access to telecommunication services, households will probably pay higher for better adaptation measures. A significant amount of perceived yearly adaptation benefits in the coastal districts revealed the economic value of extensive (22,969.50 MYR/5462.43 USD), moderate (21,853.20 MYR/5196.96 USD) and minimal adaptation measures (8022.90 MYR/1907.94 USD) that can be utilised to incentivise coastal adaptation plans. The findings suggest policies to incorporate social values to reduce vulnerability, enhance community resilience, and contribute to the knowledge gap of adaptation research in the coastal areas.",

Water depth of accumulated water may be an important influence factor of permafrost thermal stability, but there is lack of qualitative and quantitative research about that. In this study, equivalent thermal conductivity theory and solid heat transfer theory have been used to establish the calculation model for simulating heat transfer in water and soil. Thereafter, the accuracy and reliability of the calculation model are checked by monitored data and subsequently used to analyze the thermal erosion of water on underlying permafrost and permafrost under the embankment. These simulation results show that shallow water can protect permafrost and deeper water disrupts the thermal stability of underlying permafrost. The thermal effect extent of water is primarily determined by its depth, and the concept of critical depth and stable depth of accumulated water has been proposed. Moreover, the temperature field of permafrost under embankment can be changed by the slope toe water. In addition, the thermal effect range of the slope toe water is limited by the thermal influence radius, which increases with the depth of standing water. These findings provide support as well as a fundamental base for environmental issues arising from the accumulated water. These observations will, thus, also be valuable to further engineering environment studies in cold regions.",

To better understand the possible causes of extremely abnormal NCCV activities, the external forcing and dynamical analysis was conducted. The results show that the extreme NCCV activity is regulated by the preceding sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the tropical Pacific, the snow conditions over the Tibetan Plateau, and the wave-mean flow interaction over the Eurasian continent. During the preceding autumn and winter in 2020, a moderate La Niña event occurred over the tropical Pacific, which triggered the Pacific–North America teleconnection pattern (PNA) like wave train and further dispersed the Rossby wave energy downstream along the mid-latitude westerly jet, forming a zonal wave train over the Eurasian continent. Moreover, the second minimum snow depth was recorded over the southeastern Tibetan Plateau during the boreal winter of 2020/2021, which induced a concurrent local anomalous anticyclone and a cyclone over northeast Asia in the following spring. Finally, the anomalous circulation is capable of achieving energy from the mean state through barotropic energy conversion and strengthening the downstream wave train accordingly. This study highlights the joint impacts of external forcings and internal atmospheric processes on the NCCV activity.",

A thorough understanding of climate system response to these methods calls for a good understanding of the carbon cycle response. In this study, we used an Earth system model to examine the response of global climate and carbon cycle to artificial ocean alkalinization (AOA), a method of CO2 removal, and reduction in solar irradiance that represents the overall effect of solar radiation modification. In our simulations, AOA is applied uniformly over the global ice-free ocean under the RCP8.5 scenario to bring down atmospheric CO2 to the level of RCP4.5, and SRM is applied uniformly over the globe under the RCP8.5 scenario to bring down global mean surface temperature to the level of RCP4.5. Our simulations show that with the same goal of temperature stabilization, AOA and SRM cause fundamentally different perturbations of the ocean and land carbon cycle. By the end of the 21st century, relative to the simulation of RCP8.5, AOA-induced changes in ocean carbonate chemistry enhances global oceanic CO2 uptake by 983 PgC and increases global mean surface ocean pH by 0.42. Meanwhile, AOA reduces land CO2 uptake by 79 PgC and reduces atmospheric CO2 concentration by 426 × 10−6. By contrast, relative to the simulation of RCP8.5, SRM has a minor effect on the oceanic CO2 uptake and ocean acidification. SRM-induced cooling enhances land CO2 uptake by 140 PgC and reduces atmospheric CO2 concentration by 63 × 10−6. A sudden termination of SRM causes a rate of temperature change that is much larger than that of RCP8.5. A sudden termination of AOA causes a rate of temperature change that is comparable to that of RCP8.5 and a rate of ocean acidification that is much larger than that of RCP8.5.",

    "abstract": "Studies on the responses of soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen dynamics to Holocene climate and environment in permafrost peatlands and/or wetlands might serve as analogues for future scenarios, and they can help predict the fate of the frozen SOC and nitrogen under a warming climate. To date, little is known about these issues on the Qinghai‒Tibet Plateau (QTP). Here, we investigated the accumulations of SOC and nitrogen in a permafrost wetland on the northeastern QTP, and analyzed their links with Holocene climatic and environmental changes. In order to do so, we studied grain size, soil organic matter, SOC, and nitrogen contents, bulk density, geochemical parameters, and the accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) 14C dating of the 216-cm-deep wetland profile. SOC and nitrogen contents revealed a general uptrend over last 7300 years. SOC stocks for depths of 0–100 and 0–200 cm were 50.1 and 79.0 kgC m−2, respectively, and nitrogen stocks for the same depths were 4.3 and 6.6 kgN m−2, respectively. Overall, a cooling and drying trend for regional climate over last 7300 years was inferred from the declining chemical weathering and humidity index. Meanwhile, SOC and nitrogen accumulated rapidly in 1110–720 BP, while apparent accumulation rates of SOC and nitrogen were much lower during the other periods of the last 7300 years. Consequently, we proposed a probable conceptual framework for the concordant development of syngenetic permafrost and SOC and nitrogen accumulations in alpine permafrost wetlands. This indicates that, apart from controls of climate, non-climate environmental factors, such as dust deposition and site hydrology, matter to SOC and nitrogen accumulations in permafrost wetlands. We emphasized that environmental changes driven by climate change have important impacts on SOC and nitrogen accumulations in alpine permafrost wetlands. This study could provide data support for regional and global estimates of SOC and nitrogen pools and for global models on carbon‒climate interactions that take into account of alpine permafrost wetlands on the northeastern QTP at mid-latitudes.",

    "abstract": "Precipitation data is vital fundamental data for climate change. However, obtaining precise gauge-measured precipitation in high-altitude mountains is challenging, and the precipitation obtained from various gauge types at the same station may vary. To understand the differences in precipitation observations among the three commonly used gauges in China (Chinese Standard Precipitation Gauges (CSPG), Total Rain weighing Sensor (TRwS), and Geonor T-200B (T200B)) in high-altitude mountains and to recommend a stable and cost-effective weighing gauge, a precipitation intercomparison experiment was conducted at Hulu-1 station in the Qilian Mountains. The wind-induced error in measurement was corrected with the 'universal' transfer function recommended by the Word Meteorological Organization. The comparison results, adjusted for systematic errors, showed that the rain, snow and mixed precipitation of CSPG and TRwS equipped with the same octagonal vertical double fence shields (CSPGDF and TRwSDF) and single-Alter shields (CSPGs and TRwSs) were close, while the precipitation of Tretyakov-shielded T200B was notably higher than that of CSPGs and TRwSs. The average differences in annual and daily precipitation between CSPGDF and TRwSDF from 2017 to 2021 were 12.9 mm and 0.10 mm, respectively. The daily precipitation difference between CSPGs and TRwSs from April 2019–December 2021 was 0.10 mm, while the differences between T200Bs and CSPGs and TRwSs was 0.28 mm and 0.38 mm, respectively. The wind shield performance of Alter and Tretyakov was not much different at Hulu-1 site with low wind speed, thus the measurement principle of T200Bs was the primary cause of the high observations. Taking the corrected CSPGDF measurement as the standard, the dynamic loss of CSPGs was 17.6%, while that of CSPGUn was 55.6%, indicating that the single-Alter shield could effectively reduce the impact of wind on precipitation measurement. Considering the comparison results and the price difference of the instruments, it was recommended to use a single-Alter shielded TRwS gauge for precipitation observation in high-altitude mountains.",

This study systematically analysed the spatial characteristics of snow resources, climatic conditions and ski resorts in China; revealed the potential impacts of climatic environment on current ski resorts by using Regional Climate Model (RegCM4.4); and proposed suggestions for climate resource assessment and spatial planning of ski resorts. The mean snow depth and snow cover days are more than 4.50 cm and 150 d between the years 2000 and 2014, respectively, in high-latitude areas, where fewer ski resorts are located. In the middle-low latitude areas, the mean snow depth and snow cover days are less than 3.00 cm and 100 d, respectively, with ski resorts being intensively distributed. In most of these areas, the pronounced climate warming exceeded 0.50 °C during the ski period of 2009–2015 relative to 1961–2015, and mean annual precipitation was less than 800 mm, with some even less than 400 mm. In the 2030s and 2050s, the regions with drastic temperature increases are mainly in the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau, Northeast China, and the Yangtze River Basin. The upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River are expected to experience reduced snowfalland temperature increases with an almost 1–1.6 °C, respectively. In this context, some ski resorts will face major threats because of shortened skiing durations and rising management costs. Skiing tourism should not pursue a one-sided growth rate in the number of ski resorts in areas with short snowpack periods. Instead, it should rely highly on snow resources, climatic conditions, geographical environment, population and economic basis, and rationalise its spatial layout to promote the industry towards sustainable development.",

    "abstract": "Insurance against climate risk is essential for mitigating the adverse effects of climate change. However, theoretical consensus regarding climate risk insurance remains elusive, and the implementation of climate insurance policies varies markedly between countries owing to various challenges. This study conducted bibliometric analysis of 1082 relevant publications (1975–2022) to determine the theoretical basis, evolution of research hotspots, and methodologies associated with climate risk insurance. Climate insurance publications are growing at an average annual rate of 8.9%, with more than 2333 authors from 1103 organizations in 78 countries publishing on the subject. On the basis of milestones of global climate change assessment, i.e., the publication of the Fourth and Fifth Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, climate insurance research can be divided into three major phases. In the start-up phase (1975–2007), research schemes examined the feasibilities and potentials of the National Flood Insurance Program in the United States, and the socioeconomic implications of transferring climate risk through reinsurance. The methodologies used in these studies were relatively simple owing to lack of comprehensive data. Research on flood insurance increased rapidly during the development phase (2008–2014), with increasing emphasis on the possibility of developing a flood insurance market in the Netherlands. Studies utilized catastrophe modeling and probabilistic approaches to estimate natural disaster losses and financial impacts. The boom phase (2015–2022) involved more research on the affordability of climate risk insurance given income inequality. The topic of climate insurance and the scope of its impact have developed global and interdisciplinary characteristics in terms of journal, sector, and disciplinary base. In the future, a trend might develop whereby big data will be combined with artificial intelligence and machine learning to design and implement index insurance.",

Reanalysis products (e.g., ERA-I, ERA5-land, JRA55, MERRA2) are the primary source data for the research about ROS events in the large-scale region. However, the accuracy and reliability of reanalyses have never been evaluated with respect to the determination of terrestrial ROS events. The present study aims to statistically evaluate the performance of reanalysis datasets in identifying ROS events with different criteria based on in-situ rainfall data and MODIS snow cover product. The results show that all reanalysis datasets exhibit poor performance (Recall ≤ 0.16, kappa coefficient ≤ 0.26, F-score ≤ 0.42, MCC ≤ 0.33) in all criteria in the pan-Arctic, mainly due to the low accuracy of rainfall data (r≤ 0.56). Nevertheless, the spatial distribution pattern and hot spots of ROS from all reanalysis datasets are essentially close. The hot spots of ROS are mainly located on the coast of Alaska, Norway, and Greenland. All reanalyses demonstrate an increase in rainy days, but there is little overall change in ROS events due to the reduction in snow cover days. This work suggests that none of the current reanalyses are reliable in the determination of ROS events due to the poor representation of the rainfall parameterization scheme. The development of alternative strategies that can investigate ROS events at large-scale is urgently needed in a changing Arctic under rapid warming.",

    "abstract": "Advanced knowledge of glacier ice volume is vital for water resource assessment. Previous studies have focused on the estimation of ice volume, but the quantitative understanding of the spatial variability of ice volume across High Mountain regions is currently lacking. Here, we used global-scale ice thickness, debris cover and equilibrium line data to analyse ice-volume differences at various scales across High Mountain Asia (HMA). The results showed that 6.3% of the HMA glaciers are covered by debris, with debris area and volume accounting for 9% and 13.8% of the total glacier area and volume, respectively. An average debris-cover volume ratio of 13% was observed. The spatial distribution of ice volume across the HMA varies considerably from region to region. The ice volume is predominately distributed on north-facing slopes and accounts for approximately 38% of the total. It is very common in Altay and Sayan, East Tian Shan, West Kunlun, East Kunlun and Qilian Shan. Meanwhile, ice volumes in the Himalayas and Hengduan Shan are mainly distributed on the southeast aspect. Relative weight functions showed that glacier area, maximum length and average thickness are closely related to ice volume, with average relative weights of 63.7%, 22.5% and 9.8%, respectively. This study is important for the evolution of glacier volume and water resource assessment.",

Ambient cold energy can be effectively utilized by two-phase closed thermosyphons (TPCTs) to cool the permafrost. Therefore, we installed TPCTs in a cast-in-place pile foundation to create a unique structure called a thermal pile, which effectively utilizes the TPCTs to regulate ground temperature. And we conducted a case study and numerical simulation to exhibit the cooling performance, and optimize the structure of the thermal pile. The purpose of this study is to promote the application of thermal piles in unstable permafrost regions. Based on the findings, the thermal pile operated for approximately 53% of the entire year and effectively reduced the deep ground temperature at a rate of at least −0.1 °C per year. Additionally, it successfully raised the permafrost table that is 0.35 m shallower than the natural ground level. These characteristics prove highly beneficial in mitigating the adverse effects of permafrost degradation and enhancing infrastructure safety. Expanding the length of the condenser section and the diameter of the TPCT in a suitable manner can effectively enhance the cooling capability of the thermal pile and ensure the long-term mechanical stability of the pile foundation even under climate warming.",

    "abstract": "During winter of 2021/2022, the temperature in China is characterized by a warm-to-cold transition, and the average temperature anomaly in February 2022 is –1.6 °C, the coldest February in 2013–2022. We revealed the circulation regimes and physical mechanisms associated with this reversal event and demonstrated the advantage of a regional model downscaling over the use of the global model alone in predicting. In early winter, the warm anomalies are mainly related to an anomalous anticyclonic system downstream of a PNA-like (Pacific–North America) Rossby-wave train induced by La Niña. In late winter, due to the circulation response to the central Pacific warming and negative tropical Indian Ocean Dipole (TIOD), two negative–positive–negative Rossby-wave trains from high latitudes and the tropical Indian Ocean jointly lead to an anomalous cyclonic system in China. Meanwhile, an anticyclonic blocking system on the northern side of Baikal brings strong and cold air to China. These two systems together cause a significant drop in surface air temperature anomaly in China during the late winter. The Beijing Climate Center climate system model (BCC_CSM1.1m) can essentially predict this temperature reversal in China about five months in advance. However, the reversal amplitude is weaker due to warm deviations over the tropical Pacific Ocean and equatorial Indian Ocean. Using dynamic downscaling, a regional Climate–Weather Research and Forecasting (CWRF) model correctly predicts the cold SAT anomalies in late winter 2021/2022. The regional model depicts more realistic circulation patterns in East Asia; the anomalous cyclonic system in Inner Mongolia accompanied by the northerly anomalies contribute to a lower-than-normal SAT over China. This study reveals the cooperative effect of wave trains from high latitudes and the tropics on the subseasonal temperature reversal and demonstrates a possible solution to improve the forecast skill by dynamic downscaling according to precise characterization of local surface information.",

    "abstract": "The detailed physical processes involved in slowing glacier ablation by material cover remain poorly understood so far. In the present study, using the snow cover model SNOWPACK, the effect of geotextile cover on the energy and mass balance at the tongue of the Urumqi Glacier No. 1 (Chinese Tien Shan) was simulated between 12 July 2022 and 31 August 2022. The mass changes and the energy fluxes with and without material cover were compared. The results indicated that the geotextile covering reduced glacier ablation by approximately 68% compared to the ablation in the uncovered regions. The high solar reflectivity of the geotextile reduced the net short-wave radiation energy available for the melt by 45%. Thermal insulation of the geotextile reduced the sensible heat flux by 15%. In addition, the wet geotextile exerted a cooling effect through long-wave radiation and negative latent heat flux. This cooling effect reduced the energy available for ablation by 20%. Consequently, only 37% of the energy was used for melting compared to that used in the uncovered regions (67%). Sensitivity experiments revealed that the geotextile cover used at a thickness range of 0.045–0.090 m reduced the ice loss by approximately 68%–72%, and a further increase in the thickness of the geotextile cover led to little improvements. A higher temperature and greater wind speed increased glacier ablation, although their effects were small. When the precipitation was set to zero, it led to a significantly increased melt. Overall, the geotextile effectively protected the glacier tongue from rapid melting, and the observed results have provided inspiration for developing an effective and sustainable approach to protect the glaciers using geotextile cover.",

    "abstract": "It has been well documented that heatwaves are linked to elevated mortality and morbidity. However, the selection of optimal heatwave definitions for subsequent risk assessment has been inconsistent and there is no full picture of the effects of heatwaves with different intensities on economic losses due to mortality, which can provide important insights for public health considerations. Hence, we used a two-stage time series analysis, combined with values of statistical life (VSL) based on the value of a statistical life year to assess the economic burden of deaths associated with heatwaves of different intensities and durations and to identify the vulnerable populations and regions. We further conducted stratified analyses by age, sex, and region. We found 2.9% (95%CI: 0.0%, 6.5%)‒20.0% (95%CI: 2.9%, 34.2%) of VSL were attributable to heatwaves, corresponding to attributable economic losses (AELs) of 2.20 (95%CI: 0.32, 3.77)‒4.77 (95%CI: 1.53, 7.63) billion CNY. The economic burden of death was most sensitive to heatwave H99P_2D (99th percentile, at last 2 consecutive days), while H97.5P_2D (97.5th percentile, at last 2 consecutive days) caused the highest attributable economic losses. Females and elderly people aged ≥ 65 years were more sensitive. The AELs in the temperate zone and northern regions were larger than those in subtropical zone and southern regions during relatively low-intensity heatwaves, respectively. By contrast, the AELs in subtropical zone and southern regions were relatively higher than those in temperate zone and northern regions during relatively high-intensity heatwaves, respectively. The AELs were larger in urban areas than in rural areas. Tailored intervention strategies, primarily focusing on vulnerable populations and regions, should be formulated to reduce the economic loss due to heatwaves in the context of climate change.",

Barriers and limitations for the large-scale deployment of CCS are discussed. CCS and different technological solutions for emission reduction (e.g., energy conservation and renewable energy) are compared. The analysis shows that China should carefully evaluate the negative impacts of CCS deployment and needs to enhance the research and development input in CCS in order to master core technologies of CCS systems. Furthermore, CCS incentives should depend on actual CCS development. Based on the current situation, China may need to focus on retrofitting existing thermal power plants with CCS technology, so CCS can be promoted for future large-scale application. Fan, Y., L.

A new global daily precipitation (NGDP) dataset was constructed by applying those QC procedures to eliminate erroneous records. The NGDP dataset was evaluated using the NOAA Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) and the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) precipitation datasets. The results showed that the frequency distribution and spatial distribution pattern of NGDP had a nice match with those from the CMAP and GPCP datasets. The global mean correlation coefficients with the CMAP and GPCP data increased from 0.24 for original GTS precipitation data to about 0.70 for NGDP data. Correspondingly, the root mean square errors (RMSE) decreased from 12 mm per day to 1 mm per day. The interannual variabilities of NGDP monthly precipitation are consistent with the CMAP and GPCP datasets in Asia. Meanwhile, the seasonal variabilities for most land areas on the Earth of NGDP dataset are also consistent with the CMAP and GPCP precipitation products. Nie, S.-P., Y. Luo, W.-P.

    "abstract": "In this paper, based on hourly precipitation observations in 1977–2013 in the Beijing area, China, hourly precipitation in summer (June‒August) is classified into three categories: light (below the 50th percentile values), moderate (the 50th to 95th percentile values), and heavy (above the 95th percentile values). Results reveal that both light and moderate precipitation decreased significantly during the research period and thereby caused the decrease in summer totals. By contrast, pronounced trends failed to be detected in the heavy category. Since 2004, the contribution of heavy rainfall to the summer total precipitation in the urban area increased as compared to the suburban area, which is opposite to light rainfall. There are obvious differences in the diurnal variations of classified precipitation. Light precipitation shows a double peak structure in the early morning and at night, while moderate and heavy rainfall show a single peak at night. Light precipitation at the early morning peak time decreased significantly in the whole Beijing area. Compared with the suburban area, light precipitation in the urban area occurred less frequently whereas heavy precipitation occurred more frequently at evening peak time after 2004. The asymmetry of the rainfall is obvious, especially, for heavy precipitation. The asymmetry of heavy precipitation events in the urban area exhibits a significant increasing trend.",

In the future, utilization of wind power is still expected to carry out in China mainly with a large-scale centralized layout. Here, we examine the potential climatic impacts of large-scale windfarms associated with deployment scale in China using numerical experiments, in which four deployment scenarios were designed. These four scenarios represented relatively small- (484 GW), medium- (2165 GW) and large-scale (3490 GW and 5412 GW) installed wind power capacities, respectively. Results showed that turbulent kinetic energy, wind velocity, and air temperature varied consistently within those windfarms with the largest changes in turbine hub heights. Moreover, the above relatively large-scale windfarms could induce regional warming with a maximum of above 0.8 °C in North China. This regional warming may be linked to an anomalous circulation pattern with a negative pressure anomaly center in Northeast China and a positive pressure anomaly center in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze-Huaihe River Basin.",

The results showed that implementing the low carbon cement standard will be beneficial in promoting an upgrading of cement production processes, and strengthening the energy conservation and emission reduction in the cement industry. If there is no change in the existing technology, the cement industry will reduce SO2 emissions by 1.17 kg and NOx emissions by 4.44 kg per ton of CO2 emission reduction.

By comparing revolts frequency with temperature and precipitation series, the interaction between climate and social responses is analyzed. It can be concluded that revolts broke out more frequently in colder periods and less frequently in warmer periods. There were much more revolts in drought decades than in wet decades, and the three fatal peasant uprisings in the Qing Dynasty were all ignited by severe droughts. The impacts of changes in temperature and precipitation on revolts should be estimated at different time scales. The correspondence emerged at neither decadal nor yearly scale until the turn between 18th and 19th centuries, the critical period when per capita cropland area decreased to a vulnerable level.

This is a serious meteorological disaster and extreme climatic event taking place under the climatic background of a warm phase of the Little Ice Age. In this paper, by means of historical literature records, the rainy and flooding situation and the weather characteristics of these years are reconstructed and the maps depicting areas of prolonged rain, flood and concomitant famine, insect pest, and pestilence are made. The results show that, in 1755, the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, and the Huaihe River Basin experienced a prolonged rainy season with multiple torrential rain events. The continuous rainy period exceeded 40 days in the Huang-Huai Region. An early Meiyu occurred, and the duration of the Meiyu period in the lower Yangtze River Basin was 43 days, the longest in the 18th century. Particularly in Nanjing the annual rainfall of 1755 was 1,378 mm, the highest record of the 18th century. The year of 1755 is characterized by lower temperature in summer, early frost in autumn, and heavy snowfall and freezing rain in winter. These characteristics are extremely similar to those of 1823 and 1954, two typical years of extreme rainfall. And all these three years with extreme precipitation are corresponding to the minimum phase of the solar activity cycle.

The results show that, around 300 million people are expected to migrate from rural areas to urban areas by 2050 following a trend, in which people are moving gradually from small and medium city groups to large and super city groups. The migration trend together with the improvement in living standard will promote China's infrastructure construction, industry production, and energy service demand growth. Under the Business as Usual (BAU) scenario, total primary energy consumption in China will reach 8.4 Gtce by 2050, energy-related CO2 emissions will increase to 17.6 Gt, which is 83% higher than the 2013 level. While in the Low Carbon Transition (LCT) scenario with technology innovation, the total primary energy demand for China in 2050 could be controlled at ∼6 Gtce; CO2 emissions would peak during 2020–2025, and be reduced by 78% by 2050 compared to the BAU scenario. In the transition process, non-fossil fuel power generation and energy efficiency technologies have the largest mitigation potentials. Industry and power sectors would peak first before 2020, followed by the building and transport sectors which are projected to peak around 2030. The total additional capital investment required for LCT would account for 1.5% of GDP. Therefore, it is technologically and economically feasible for China to implement new urbanization strategy.",

It acknowledges the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the European Union (EU) and the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) as current institutional case studies (and key actors) for international climate politics. It answers the question of the extent to which climate security scholars have mapped the field with respect to these three institutions. To do this, it reviews relevant literature of climate security and concisely summarizes the literature views. Although climate security scholars have studied how these specialist institutions have understood global climate governance, a comparative coverage of how the institutions have conceptualized climate security is missing in existing literature. The key finding shows the concepts of epistemic communities, climate securitization and climate-riskifications as appropriate analytical themes for interpreting the emerging norm of climate security. Arguing that conceptual development persists even though the institutions original mandates did not require such conceptualization, the study uses discourse analysis of relevant literature on climate security to orient future research on climate change and climate security given the knowledge that speech-acts on climate security (henceforth speech-acts) now seem like potential policy consideration in the foreseeable future.",

In this study, we investigated the statistics of stationarity in the totals and extremes of precipitation in CA based on the longest observational records (1881–2006), tree-ring reconstructed records (1756–2012 and 1760–2015), and the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) simulations, applying the autocorrelation function and testing criteria established based on the statistical definitions of stationarity. We analyzed the longest daily precipitation record (Tashkent station, 1881–2006) and found that the autocorrelation coefficient of the precipitation totals (PRCPTOT) and annual maximum 1-day precipitation amount (Rx1day) were statistically insignificant for all lags, implying stationary behavior. Regionally, nearly all the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily Database (GHCN-D) observatory sites (1925–2005) indicated likely stationary behavior. The reconstructed records were also indistinguishable from a random process. For the CMIP5 models, the simulated and projected PRCPTOT closely approximated a purely random process; however, the projected Rx1day maintained non-stationary means in most of the models under the representative concentration pathway (RCPs), implying that extreme events would increase in the future. The mean precipitation changes (ΔP) can be expressed as an exponential function depending on the length of the successive mean periods (μ) and variance (σ2). The ΔP of the next decade is projected to be within ±14.8% of the previous decades mean annual PRCPTOT over CA. The higher the RCPs, the higher the ΔP over CA. The results show that the detection and prediction of precipitation change will be challenging in arid CA.",

This study aimed to examine the impacts and burden of heat on EACs in China, quantify the contributions of regional modifiers, and identify the vulnerable populations. A semi-parametric generalized additive model with a Poisson distribution was used to analyze the city-specific impacts of the daily maximum temperature (Tmax) on EACs in June–August in 2014–2017. Stratified analyses by sex and age were performed to identify the vulnerable sub-populations. Meta-analysis was undertaken to illustrate the pooled associations. Further subgroup analysis, stratified by climate, latitude, and per capita disposable income (PCDI), and meta-regression analysis were conducted to explore the regional heterogeneity and quantify the contributions of possible modifiers. The city- and region-specific attributable fractions of EACs attributable to heat were calculated. Strong associations were observed between the daily Tmax and total EACs in all cities. A total of 11.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 11.2%–12.3%) of EACs were attributed to high temperatures in ten Chinese cities, and the central region with a low level of PCDI had the highest attributable fraction of 17.8% (95% CI: 17.2%–18.4%). People living in the central region with lower PCDI, and those aged 18–44 and 0–6 years were more vulnerable to heat than the others. The combined effects of PCDI, temperature, and latitude contributed 88.6% of the regional heterogeneity. The results complemented the understanding of the burden of EACs attributable to heat in developing countries and the quantitative contribution of regional modifiers.",

However, decreases in PM2.5 concentration due to regional PM2.5 transport driven by meteorological changes, and the relationship between the PM2.5 source and receptor, are poorly understood. Therefore, this study assessed how changes in meteorology, local emissions, and regional transport from external source emissions contributed to the decrease in Wuhan's PM2.5 concentration, using FLEXPART-WRF and WRF-Chem modelling experiments. The results showed that meteorological changes in central China explain up to 22.2% of the total decrease in PM2.5 concentrations in Wuhan, while the remaining 77.8% was due to air pollutant emissions reduction. Reduction in air pollutant emissions depended on both local and external sources, which contributed alomst equally to the reduction in PM2.5 concentrations (38.7% and 39.1% of the total reduction, respectively). The key emissions source areas affecting PM2.5 in Wuhan during the COVID-lockdown were identified by the FLEXPART-WRF modeling, revealing that regional-joint control measures in key areas accounted for 89.3% of the decrease in PM2.5 concentrations in Wuhan. The results show that regional-joint control can be enhanced by identifying key areas of emissions reduction from the source–receptor relationship of regional PM2.5 transport driven by meteorology under the background of East Asian monsoon climate change.",

    "abstract": "High mountains (known as water towers) in the arid areas of Northwest China (ARNWC) are major suppliers of water resources for the downstream oasis region, where large populations and economic activities are concentrated. Studies on both water supply and water demand in central Asia including ARNWC have been explored in recent decades, but a precise study on the importance and vulnerability of fine-scale water towers still needs to be conducted, because oases are isolated each other and each oasis has its own specific tower(s). Here we ranked the importance of water tower units (WTUs) using a simplified water tower index (WTI) based on water amount of supply/demand side at a fine river basin scale. Then the vulnerability of these WTUs is assessed with the consideration of future changes in climate, population, GDP, water stress, etc. We concluded that the WTU of the Mid-branch Rivers of the Junggar Basin is the most important with the highest WTI, while the Yarkant River Basin is the most vulnerable. The WTUs such as the Yarkant, Hotan and Kaxgar of the Tarim River Basin as well as the Hei River of the Hexi Corridor are important at present and vulnerable under a considerable pressure from future climate change scenarios. To respond to these opportunities and risks, it is better to reduce the proportion of the primary industry appropriately, improve the efficiency of water use and strengthen the supervision of water resources utilization, especially in the industrial and urban planning as well as ecological engineering projects.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to the input perspective for evaluating planning metrics, this research takes the climatic environmental output effects as the starting point for assessing ecological city construction. Based on approaches such as observation data analysis, meteorological model simulation, and remote sensing, a set of climatic environmental performance assessment methods is developed and established. These methods mainly focus on surface ventilation assessment and urban thermal environment assessment. With the Yanqi Lake ecological development demonstration area located in Huairou district, Beijing as an example, the assessment of the local climatic environment before and after the construction are conducted, and relevant policy suggestions for urban planning and construction are presented. The results show that after development, the ventilation capacity will decrease overall and the ventilation potential index will decrease from 0.53 to 0.44. While this is not a large reduction, and is still at a favorable level, the ventilation potential in some local areas will markedly decrease. Furthermore, the thermal environment will become poorer to some extent; the urban heat island (UHI) area and intensity will increase compared with the current situation; continuous heat islands may occur in local areas; the UHI potential index of the core area will rise from 0.0878 to 0.1217 (still a favorable level). Therefore, urban surfaces should be carefully developed and arranged during planning. It is suggested that the negative impacts of large areas of urban construction on the local climatic environment in the Yanqi Lake could be mitigated by 1) strengthening the airflow by introducing fresh, cold, northwesterly air via constructed ventilation corridors, 2) increasing the number of ecological cold sources, particularly for water bodies and green belts to prevent the UHI in the southern region of Yanqi Lake from becoming linked with each other, and 3) considering a pre-program before sub-domain and building planning to obtain optimum building locations. Different construction standards should be developed for different ventilation potential and UHI intensity levels. For strong heat island areas, land areas should be reserved to serve as cold sources.",

From 1980 to 2010, simulated surface BC concentrations and all-sky direct radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere due to atmospheric BC increased by 0.15 μg m−3 (63%) and by 0.23 W m−2 (62%), respectively, averaged over the Tibetan Plateau (75–105°E, 25–40°N). Simulated annual mean surface BC concentrations were in the range of 0.24–0.40 μg m−3 averaged over the plateau for 1980–2010, with the decadal trends of 0.13 μg m−3 per decade in the 1980s and 0.08 in the 2000s. The interannual variations were −5.4% to 7.0% for deviation from the mean, 0.0062 μg m−3 for mean absolute deviation, and 2.5% for absolute percent departure from the mean. Model sensitivity simulations indicated that the decadal trends of surface BC concentrations were mainly driven by changes in emissions, while the interannual variations were dependent on variations of both meteorological parameters and emissions. Meteorological parameters played a crucial role in driving the interannual variations of BC especially in the monsoon season.",

    "abstract": "Drying soil has been conducive to a high frequency of extreme high-temperature events over many regions worldwide in recent decades. However, changes in the intraseasonal variability of soil moisture can also influence the likelihood of extremely high temperatures. Although previous investigators have examined the association between extremely high temperatures and large-scale atmospheric circulation variability, the role of land–atmosphere coupling dominated by soil moisture variability in extremely high temperatures, particularly over the Eurasian continent, is not well understood. In this study, on the basis of the Land Surface, Snow, and Soil Moisture Model Intercomparison Project, we found that land–atmosphere feedback amplified the variability of soil moisture in most regions of Eurasia during summer from 1980 to 2014. This amplification of soil moisture variability is closely correlated with more intensive intraseasonal variability of surface air temperature and more frequent occurrences of extreme high-temperature events, particularly in Europe, Siberia, Northeast Asia, and the Indochina Peninsula. This correlation implies that increasing the intraseasonal variability of soil moisture results in a high likelihood of heat extremes during summer in most parts of Eurasia except Asian desert areas. On the intraseasonal timescale, the land–atmosphere coupling increases the variability of surface sensible heat flux and net long-wave radiation heating the atmosphere by intensifying the soil moisture variability, thus amplifying the variability of surface air temperature and enhancing the extreme high-temperature days. This finding demonstrates the importance of changes in intraseasonal soil moisture variability for the increasing likelihood of heat extremes in summer.",

Mass loss in recent remote sensing-based studies indicated that the Antarctic Peninsula has rapid rates of glacier retreat and speed up of surface velocity. However, observations of seasonal variability of ice speed are limited, and glacier-area changes require multi-temporal monitoring. This study investigated the changes in area and surface velocities of ∼375 glaciers on the northern Antarctic Peninsula (NAP) utilizing satellite images acquired by the Sentinel 1&2 satellites during 2018–2022. The results indicate that the glacier area reduced by approximately 166.1 ± 44.2 km2 (−0.2% ± 0.1% per year) during the study period, with an acceleration after 2020 (−0.4% ± 0.3% per year), and the most dramatic reduction happened on the eastern NAP. The maximum annual ice speeds on the NAP generally exceeded 3500 m per year, while the ice speeds in 2021 were the highest (exceeded 4210 m per year). The ice speed variability in austral autumn was higher than in other seasons, meanwhile the summer ice speeds showed an increasing trend. The glacier G012158E47018N, McNeile Glacier, glacier G299637E64094S and Drygalski Glacier showed the most remarkable ice speed variations represented by high daily velocities and strong fluctuations on their termini. Our results demonstrated that the variations in glacier area and seasonal ice speed on the NAP were responsive to the ice‒ocean‒atmosphere processes. Therefore, seasonal velocity and area variations should be considered when conducting accurate mass balance calculations, model validations and change mechanism analyses under climate warming scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Recognizing the relationship between gross primary production (GPP) and precipitation in eastern China, the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) plays a crucial role in shaping GPP. Despite confirmation of the strong link between EASM and GPP, there remains a notable research gap in understanding the specific impact of the EASM on GPP in different regions of eastern China. Here we used simulations from Trends in Net Land–Atmosphere Carbon Exchanges (TRENDY) models from 1951 to 2010 and divided eastern China into five subregions for the study. We also used the New East Asian Summer Monsoon Index (NEWI) as a quantitative metric to distinguish between periods of strong and weak EASM. Building on this, this study aims to investigate the response of GPP in different subregions of eastern China. Regionally, under strengthened EASM years (1954, 1957, 1965, 1969, 1977, 1980, 1983, 1987, 1993 and 1998), East China experienced the most pronounced increase in GPP at 12 ± 21 (mean ±1 sigma) gC m−2 mon−1 compared to the weak EASM years (1958, 1961, 1972, 1973,1978, 1981, 1985, 1994, 1997 and 2004). In contrast, Southwest China showed a decline in GPP at −4 ± 10 gC m−2 mon−1. Moreover, GPP also increased in Northeast and North China when EASM strengthened, while South China showed a decline in GPP. This indicated that GPP changed with monsoon intensity. According to the mechanism analysis, during strong EASM, there was intense moisture convergence through alterations in the atmospheric circulation field over East China and abundant precipitation, which further contributed to the increase in GPP. Downward solar radiation in Southwest China decreased with EASM enhancement, which suppressed GPP and hindered vegetation growth. Overall, the results highlight the importance of accurately predicting the impact of different EASM intensities of regional carbon fluxes.",

Hydrological processes were simulated to predict changes under four future scenarios (SSP1, SSP2, SSP3, and SSP5) using a classical hydrological model coupled with a glacier dynamics module. Discharge rates at annual, monthly (June, July, August) and daily timescales were obtained from two hydrological gauges: Urumqi Glacier No.1 hydrological station (UGH) and Zongkong station (ZK). Overall, annual and summer discharge increased significantly (p < 0.05) at both stations over the study period. Their intra-annual variations mainly resulted from differences in their recharge mechanisms. The simulations show that a tipping point in annual discharge at UGH may occur between 2018–2024 under the four SSPs scenarios. Glacial discharge is predicted to cease earlier at ZK than at UGH. This relates to glacier type and size, suggesting basins with heavily developed small glaciers will reach peak discharge sooner, resulting in an earlier freshwater supply challenge. These findings serve as a reference for research into glacial runoff in Central Asia and provide a decision-making basis for planning local water-resource projects.",

Exploring heat-related urolithiasis susceptibility subtypes, economic burden, and modifying factors could assist governments in targeting interventions to reduce the heat-related health risks of urolithiasis morbidity. We collected data on 23,492 patients with upper urinary tract stones (main subtypes of urolithiasis) from 2013 to 2017 in Nanjing, China. We adopted generalized additive quasi-Poisson models to examine the associations between daily mean temperatures and morbidity of upper urinary tract stones, while generalized additive Gaussian models were used to explore the relationships between temperatures and log-transformed medical costs. We examined the modification effects of disease subtypes (kidney and ureteral calculus), sex, and age through stratified analyses and the modification effects of other meteorological factors by introducing interaction terms in the models. We found that short-term summer heat exposure has a statistically significant effect on ureteral calculus morbidity but not on kidney calculus morbidity. For ureter calculus, a 1 °C temperature increase was associated with a 4.36% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.94%, 6.83%) increase in daily hospitalization and a 5.44% (95% CI: 2.71%, 8.25%) increase in daily medical costs.

However, the existing literature provides a limited understanding of the relative contribution of these factors to the occurrence of geohazards with a warming climate, posing tremendous challenges for risk management in mountainous areas. Ya'an city is susceptible to hazards because of its steep terrain, abundant precipitation and active seismic activity. In this regard, we utilise the GeoDetector model to extract critical environmental factors affecting the spatial patterns of mountain geohazards (i.e., landslide, debris flow and rockfall) in Southwest China. The analysis indicates that the factors with the highest explanatory power for the spatial distribution of landslides, debris flows, and rockfalls are soil property, extreme precipitation and extreme temperature, respectively. Notably, we revealed the synergistic effects among factors given their larger q-value than individual ones. We further explored the responses of mountain geohazards to climate change, including the rising temperature and precipitation, because the frequent occurrence of mountain geohazards is closely related to a warming climate. The variation in snow water equivalent caused by antecedent snowfall and snowdrifts acts as a crucial indicator for geohazards, highlighting the significance of snow and wind observations in meteorological nowcasting and disaster prewarning. We disclose the phenomenon of the geohazard hysteresis to the precipitation peak resulting from the top–down (i.e., precipitation-runoff and surface-deep soil moisture) peak shifts. Our work is expected to enhance the precision of susceptibility assessment models and the reliability of short-term forecasts for mountain geohazards.",

The current research lacks long-term data validation, especially in the context of climate change. Based on the 13-year (2011–2023) temperature and deformation monitoring data from the Qinghai‒Tibet Power Transmission Line, this study investigates the characteristics of permafrost variation and its impact on the stability of tower footings under the cooling effect from thermosyphons. The results reveal that the thermosyphons effectively reduce the ground temperature around the footings. After the first freeze‒thaw cycle, the soil around the tower footings completed refreezing and maintained a frozen state. In the following 13 years, the ground temperature continued to decrease due to the cooling effect of thermosyphons. The duration notably exceeded the previously predicted 5 years. The temperature reduction at the base of the footings corresponded well with the frost jacking of the tower footings and could be divided into three distinct phases. In phase 1, the ground temperature around the footings rapidly reduced, approaching that of the natural field, while the footings experienced pronounced deformation. In phase 2, the ground temperature decreased at a faster rate, and the deformation rate of the footings slowed down. In phase 3, the frost jacking of the footings gradually retarded with the decrease in base temperature. Additionally, the ground temperature differences of over 1 °C were observed among different tower footings, which may lead to the differential deformation among the tower footings. The ground temperature differentiation is attributed to the difference in solar radiation intensity, which is shaded by the tower structure from different directions. This study provides theoretical support and empirical accumulation for the construction and maintenance of tower footings in permafrost regions.",

    "abstract": "To address the gap in understanding precipitation changes in Southeast Asia and to enhance the reliability of climate projections for the region through moisture budget analysis, this study examines the differences among six multi-model ensembles of CMIP6 simulated precipitation in term of moisture budget analysis. It investigates the relative contributions of thermodynamic and dynamic components to seasonal precipitation changes over Southeast Asia under the highest emission scenario, SSP5-8.5. The comparison between ensembles indicates that Good performance model ensembles slightly outperform the combination of all resolution and all category ensembles in reducing the biases. There is no strong evidence showing that good category ensembles outperform the combination of all model ensemble groups in simulating the spatial pattern of historical seasonal precipitation. From the perspective of moisture budget, regions receiving seasonal high rainfall intensity are mainly influenced by the moisture convergence during the monsoon seasons: northeast monsoon (December‒January‒February) and southwest monsoon (June–July–August). By the late 21st century (2081‒2100), all model ensemble projections show an increase in December‒January‒February precipitation over the northern Southeast Asia and decreased June‒July‒August rainfall in the southern regions. The moisture budget analysis explained that the seasonal mean rainfall change in Southeast Asia is largely influenced by evaporation and followed by moisture flux convergence. The changes in moisture flux convergence are contributed by both the dynamic and thermodynamic components. Greater inter-model uncertainty was found in the precipitation dynamic component compared to the thermodynamic component suggesting the existence of large discrepancy between the various approaches used by GCMs in describing atmospheric dynamics. The study highlights that the Good model ensemble with middle to low resolution is able to narrow the inter-model uncertainties in terms of the moisture budget analysis compared to the combination of all Good model ensembles.",

This paper concentrates on the residential air-conditioner industry and analyzes the environmental benefits of accelerating the phase-out of HCFC-22 in China. According to the comparison of the baseline and phase-out scenarios of HCFC-22, the findings show that using HC-290 (propane) as a refrigerant alternative will directly reduce the greenhouse effect, and indirectly reduce the emission of greenhouse gases due to a reduction in the electricity consumption. The comparison of two scenarios of HC-290 and HFC-410A refrigerant alternatives shows that the use of HC-290 refrigerant will produce significantly higher environmental benefits than the HFC-410A refrigerant.

More extreme events transit to the two-time Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) relationship at lower temperatures.

However, there is a lack of synthesized knowledge about the contributions and profitability on socio-economic aspects of the cryospheric services (CSs). To cope with this key and urgent sustainable development issues, this study constructs a comprehensive regionalization research system that integrates the natural and socio-economic aspects for cryospheric characteristics with emphasis on interdisciplinary approaches. Guided by the supply-demand equilibrium model and the service maximization model, the research system consists of establishing a classification system for CSs, identifying the spatial distribution pattern of CSs, and constructing the comprehensive regionalization of CSs, which finally divides the research area into relatively independent, complete, and organically linked CS units of multiple spatial levels. By setting up a bridge between the CSs with socio-economic needs, it has profound and practical significance and implications for implementing the sustainable utilization strategies and macroeconomic policymaking for global environmental protection.",

    "abstract": "Reductions in the transportation sector's carbon dioxide emissions are increasingly of global concern. As one of the first low-carbon pilot and carbon trading pilot cities, and as one of the largest automobile production bases in China, Chongqing has multiple low-carbon transportation policies that are coupled. In this study, three policy scenarios are set, including: 1) improving the fuel economy of newly sold gasoline passenger cars to 5.7 l per 100 km by 2020, 2) promoting pure electric private cars to increase the share to 7% of private car sales by 2020, and 3) the policy mix scenario of the above two policies. Simulations are undertaken with the Chinese Academy of Sciences general equilibrium (CAS-GE) model, a type of computable GE model, to assess the macro-economic impact and the industrial impact of the three policy scenarios. Through the policy impact mechanism analysis and data-mapping process, the micro-economic impact analysis results, including costs and fuel savings, for the two policies from the bottom-up model are taken as the shock variables and inputs for the CAS-GE model. The results show that: 1) the two policies will both have a slightly negative impact (−0.09% and −0.30%) on Chongqing's GDP in 2020; 2) the employment rate will decrease by 0.12% and 0.47%, but the inflation rate will be restrained to a certain extent (−0.21% and −0.17%); and 3) the complementarity of the mixed policy can weaken the negative impact of the two policies when implemented separately. The mixed policy will reduce the GDP slightly by 0.37%, compared with the cumulative effect of the two policies implemented separately, resulting in cost-effective synergies at the macro-economic impact level; and 4) the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has an uncertain impact on the results. The method and results can provide a reference for the formulation and adjustment of low-carbon transportation policies in other large cities.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to decreased Arctic sea ice extent, Antarctic sea ice extent shows a somewhat increased trend. There is a large interannual variability of Antarctic sea ice, especially in the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. The change and variability of Antarctic sea ice in synoptic timescales in the recent decades remain unclear. We identify synoptic modes of variability of Antarctic summer sea ice by applying the Self Organizing Map (SOM) technique to daily sea ice concentration data for the period 1979–2018. Nearly 40% of the variability is characterized by opposite changes between sea ice cover in the Bellingshausen, Amundsen and western Ross Seas and in the rest of the Antarctic seas, and another 30% by meridional asymmetry in the Weddell, Amundsen, and Ross Seas. Most of these spatial patterns may be explained by the dynamics and thermodynamic processes associated with anomalous atmospheric circulations related to the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) with a structure of strong zonal asymmetry. The interannual variability of the sea ice modes appears to have little connection to SAM, and only a weak relation to ENSO. The annual frequencies of SOM node occurrences also show a great decadal variability. Node 9 appears mainly prior to 1990; while node 1 occurs mainly after 1990. The decadal variability of nodes 1 and 9 is associated with the asymmetrical SAM, which results from two wavetrains excited over northern Australia and the southeastern Indian Ocean. These results further highlight the importance of understanding the role of southern mid-to-high latitude atmospheric intrinsic variability in predicting Antarctic summer sea ice variations from synoptic to decadal timescales.",

To assess the situation of ocean acidification, we investigated the spatial variability of aragonite saturation states (ΩAr) in July 2010 during the 4th Chinese National Arctic Research Expedition (CHINARE). The surface waters were all oversaturated with respect to aragonite (ΩAr > 1) due to high biological removal, and ΩAr ranged from 1.43 to 3.17. The relatively low ΩAr values were found in the western Bering Strait and eastern nearshore region of the Bering Sea Shelf, which were associated with the upwelling and riverine input, respectively. In the subsurface, the ΩAr decreased to generally low saturation states and were observed to be strongly undersaturated (ΩAr < 1) in the bottom waters with a lowest value of 0.45, which might be caused by remineralization. However, unlike prior studies, the low ΩAr values in the shallow nearshore region were still above the saturation horizon throughout the water column, which were probably counteracted by high local primary production. In the context of climate change and increasing anthropogenic CO2 absorption, the suppression and undersaturation of ΩAr in the Bering Sea are not only attributed to the natural processes but also the accumulation of anthropogenic CO2.",

To mitigate subgrade diseases caused by thermal disturbance during the engineering construction and operation in the initial stage, the crushed-rock revetment (CRR) was additionally paved with a thickness of 1.5 m and 1.0 m on some sunny and shady shoulders of the traditional embankments along the Qinghai–Tibet railway, respectively. The improving effects for thermal and deforming stability are evaluated based on observation data of ground temperatures and embankment deformations at two sites from 2002 to 2014. The results show that a larger uplifting magnitude in the artificial permafrost table (APT), greater ground temperature decreasing amplitudes and reduction ranges of settling rate appear under the shady embankment shoulder in warm permafrost region, and both sides in the cold permafrost region when reinforcing with CRR. However, in warm permafrost region, the laying of CRR on the sunny slope of subgrade may cause considerable thermal disturbance to the underlying permafrost foundation, combined with the resulting additional stress, induce the further expansion of differential settlement. Moreover, the thermal stability strengthening effect of the CRR is closely related to the variation of the APT thickness in the earlier stage, convection intensity inside the CRR, 'cold energy reserve' in the deeper permafrost, and amount of solar radiation received by the CRR. More effective reinforcements should be implemented to alleviate the potential threaten beneath sunny embankment slope in warm permafrost regions.",

    "abstract": "Since 2020, the first national park of China, the Sanjiangyuan National Park (Park) has been put into operation in China. This Park is one of the most vulnerable regions to the rapid climate change in the Tibetan Plateau. There have not been any investigations into the current status of the glacier resources in the Park so far. This study reported the first summary of the glaciers in the Park at present and their variations since the 1960s. The data used here come from the two Chinese Glacier Inventories finished during 1969–1970 and 2006–2010, respectively, and the remote-sensing images during 1985–1990, 1995–2000 and 2018. The total glacier area in the Park is 772 km2 to our best estimate, much less than 2342 km2 reported in the first Chinese Glacier Inventory published in 2009. The shrinkage rate of the glaciers in the Yangtze River Park (a sub-park) had slowed from −0.37% per year during the 1970s to −0.09% per year during 2002–2012 in area, while that in the Lancang River Park had sped up from −0.34% per year during 1968–2000 to −0.67% per year during 2000–2018. There are no glaciers in the Yellow River Park (a sub-park). The change in the glaciers was related to the regional relatively rapidly warming and insufficient mass supply from precipitation. The geographic features of the glaciers in the Yangtze and Lancang Parks also lead to their different change extents, most of which happened at 5500 m a.s.l. and below.",

    "abstract": "River ice thickness (RIT) directly influences human activities, such as rural transportation and subsistence activities, in addition to ecosystem and hydrology processes in the Arctic. Knowledge of RIT response to the rapid Arctic warming is very limited or essentially lacking. The scientific objective of this study is to investigate changes and variations in RIT and their response to rapid Arctic warming. We used ground-based measurements of 45 river gauge sites from 1961 through 2015 spanning 12 river basins across Alaska. The results indicate that the long-term mean maximum river ice thickness (MRIT) ranged from 40.3 ± 12.7 cm in the southeast to 187.3 ± 31.9 cm in northwest Alaska. MRIT decreased dramatically from 1961 to 2015, on average, at a rate of −0.26 ± 0.17 cm per year, and RIT declined significantly in all months from October through March, and more rapidly in winter than in autumn and spring. The impacts of air temperature and snowfall on MRIT change were analysed, and their relative influences were 74% and 26%, respectively. Specifically, an increase in air temperature was the primary factor contributing to MRIT decrease, while increasing snowfall, and snow on river ice enhanced MRIT decline. Seasonally, snowfall was the primary regulator for thickness change and higher air temperature resulted in RIT declining in autumn, while ice thickness decrease was mostly driven by warming in spring. However, neither air temperature nor snowfall is the primary control factor for declining RIT in winter, and further work needs to be done to detect the reason.",

    "abstract": "Central Asia (CA) is highly sensitive and vulnerable to changes in precipitation due to global warming, so the projection of precipitation extremes is essential for local climate risk assessment. However, global and regional climate models often fail to reproduce the observed daily precipitation distribution and hence extremes, especially in areas with complex terrain. In this study, we proposed a statistical downscaling (SD) model based on quantile delta mapping to assess and project eight precipitation indices at 73 meteorological stations across CA driven by ERA5 reanalysis data and simulations of 10 global climate models (GCMs) for present and future (2081–2100) periods under two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP245 and SSP585). The reanalysis data and raw GCM outputs clearly underestimate mean precipitation intensity (SDII) and maximum 1-day precipitation (RX1DAY) and overestimate the number of wet days (R1MM) and maximum consecutive wet days (CWD) at stations across CA. However, the SD model effectively reduces the biases and RMSEs of the modeled precipitation indices compared to the observations. Also it effectively adjusts the distributional biases in the downscaled daily precipitation and indices at the stations across CA. In addition, it is skilled in capturing the spatial patterns of the observed precipitation indices. Obviously, SDII and RX1DAY are improved by the SD model, especially in the southeastern mountainous area. Under the intermediate scenario (SSP245), our SD multi-model ensemble projections project significant and robust increases in SDII and total extreme precipitation (R95PTOT) of 0.5 mm d−1 and 19.7 mm, respectively, over CA at the end of the 21st century (2081–2100) compared to the present values (1995–2014). More pronounced increases in indices R95PTOT, SDII, number of very wet days (R10MM), and RX1DAY are projected under the higher emission scenario (SSP585), particularly in the mountainous southeastern region. The SD model suggested that SDII and RX1DAY will likely rise more rapidly than those projected by previous model simulations over CA during the period 2081–2100. The SD projection of the possible future changes in precipitation and extremes improves the knowledge base for local risk management and climate change adaptation in CA.",

We re-analyzed and outlined the whole picture of the impacts of extreme temperatures on both mortality and morbidity among various populations and regions, based on the researches from a well-planned national project of Scientific Survey of Regional Meteorological Sensitive Diseases (SRMSD) with consistent methodology in China. The twenty-four representative regions of the SRMSD project cover all eleven geographical meteorological divisions in the country, including urban and rural areas. In addition to circulatory and respiratory diseases, we found that neurological diseases, injuries, digestive diseases, endocrine diseases, genitourinary diseases, skin and subcutaneous tissue diseases were sensitive to extreme heat, while digestive diseases were sensitive to extreme cold. The extreme temperature-sensitive diseases and the attributable disease burden varied by region. Females and the elderly people (65 years old and above) were more vulnerable to extreme heat when using mortality as a health outcome, whereas males and the young and middle-aged adults were more vulnerable to morbidity risk from heat. Our findings provide important scientific evidence for regional distribution of temperature-sensitive diseases and identification of vulnerable populations in China. It provides evidence and implications of developing regional heat/cold-exposure intervention policies, especially for hospital emergency departments and ambulance services during hot seasons.",

Based on a well developed of numerical model, we analyzed the 'thermal repair' effect of three redesigned differential thermal reinforcement on the partially degraded permafrost embankment with steps. The results show that, when used as a strengthening measure, the method of laying crushed rock revetment (CRR) with different thicknesses on the sunny and shady slopes cannot completely eliminate the residual warm permafrost regions formed in the previous thermal erosion. When the TCRR1 scheme is adopted for reinforcement, although horizontal region from the evaporation section of thermosyphones (TPCTs) to the right side of the embankment is remarkably cooled, permafrost under the sunny slope is still deteriorating. In the long run, both ETCRR2 and TCECRR3 reinforcement schemes can produce a large range of 'cold core' right below the whole embankment. However, from the perspective of the simultaneous functioning range and cold storage capacity, the TCECRR scheme is signally more efficient. The thermal insulation materials in the above composite strengthening measures can not only resist the heat input in the warm season, but also improve their working efficiency by maintaining the temperature difference between the evaporation section of the heat pipe and the external environment in cold season. The addition of crushed rock revetment in TCECRR has played its thermal semiconductor effect and further improved the comprehensive thermal repair efficiency of the composite measures.",

    "abstract": "Shale gas is an important alternative natural gas source that can meet China's growing energy demand. However, methane emissions during shale gas production could largely determine whether it could be considered as a bridging clean energy source. In this study, we performed methane emission measurements using three methods (on-site optical gas imaging, on-site methane patrolling, and downwind measurement) at shale gas production sites in Sichuan province, China, covering 18 well sites with 81 wells. The results showed that flowback water tanks were the major methane sources, with valves, separators, chemical injection pumps, and pneumatic controllers as other sources. The methane concentrations inside the 18 sites ranged from 1.42‒459 μmol mol−1, with over 59% of the sites having the highest concentration less than 50 μmol mol−1. The optical gas imaging method, with its low detection limit over 5000 μmol mol−1, could not capture the emission effectively. The three successful downwind measurements resulted in site level emission rates between 0.02‒0.17 kg h−1. When divided by the number of wells at each site, the emission intensity was 4%‒28% of the wellhead emission factor for natural gas production in China. More measurements are required to better quantify methane emissions from shale gas sites in China. For sites in mountainous regions or long-term low-wind regions, detection methods other than downwind measurements should be suitable for quantifying site-level emissions.",

    "abstract": "Current snow depth datasets demonstrate large discrepancies in the spatial pattern in Eurasia, and the lagging updates of datasets do not meet the operational requirements of the meteorological service department. This study developed a dynamic retrieval method for daily snow depth over Eurasia based on cross-sensor calibrated microwave brightness temperatures to enhance retrieval accuracy and meet the requirements of operational work. These brightness temperatures were detected by microwave radiometer imager carried on the FengYun 3 (FY-3) satellite and the special sensor microwave imager/sounder carried on the USA Defense Meteorological Satellite Program series satellites, which use the fewest sensors to provide the longest data and consequently introduce minimal errors during inter-sensor calibration. Firstly, inter-sensor calibration was conducted amongst brightness temperatures collected by the three sensors. A spatiotemporal dynamic relationship between snow depth and microwave brightness temperature gradient was then established, overcoming the large uncertainties induced by varying snow characteristics. This relationship can be utilised in FY-3 satellite data for operational service to obtain real-time snow depth. The generated daily snow depth dataset from 1988 to 2021 presents similar spatial patterns of snow depth to those observed in situ. Against in situ snow depth, the overall bias and root mean square error are −2.04 and 6.49 cm, respectively, facilitating considerable improvements in accuracy compared with the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 snow depth product, which adopts the static algorithm. Further analysis shows an overall decreasing trend from 1988 to 2021 for annual and monthly mean snow depths, demonstrating a noticeable reduction since around 2000. The reduction in monthly mean snow depth started earlier in shallow snow months than in deep snow months.",

This study aims to empirically analyze the impact and mechanism by which firm outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) influences pro-environmental commitments, utilizing data collected from Chinese listed companies between 2010 and 2020. The results show: 1) there is a significant positive relationship between firm OFDI and pro-environmental commitments; 2) mechanistic tests show that the OFDI can promote pro-environmental commitments through two channels: public attention and technological learning capacity; 3) heterogeneity analysis reveals that the green effects of OFDI are more pronounced firms with institutional investors and state ownership, as well as in firms situated in host countries with more stringent environmental regulations; 4) further analysis reveals OFDI-induced greater green commitments generated real environmental and economic outcomes: firms invested more in environmental protection and reduced CO2 emissions. In the meantime, they experienced lower excessive debt risk and higher innovative performance. The findings have positive implications for the promotion of firms' pro-environmental behavior and sustainable development.",

Therefore, this study introduces economic complexity as a new variable to build a panel model within the traditional Environmental Kuznets Curve framework. Based on the data of the countries along the Belt and Road from 1998 to 2018, we used the Granger causality test to examine the causal relationship between variables, and use the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Square and Dynamic Ordinary Least Square methods to estimate the coefficients of variables. The key factor linking economic complexity and carbon emissions in the logistics industry is technology innovation Economic complexity can explain and predict the changes in carbon emissions of logistics industry more reasonably, and the relationship between them in line with the environmental kuznets curve hypothesis. Only high-income countries can increase economic complexity while reducing carbon emissions of logistics industry. Based on the empirical analysis, it is suggested that upper-middle income and lower middle-income countries can formulate relevant policies and regulations, and high-income countries can improve the relevant policies and regulations to promote the reduction of carbon emissions of the logistics industry. Studying the impact of economic complexity on carbon emissions in the logistics industry can help better predict and respond to the impact of climate change on the logistics industry.",

The regional average temperature anomaly for February 2022 was −0.65°C, making it the third coldest February from 2000‒2022. Understanding the influence of anthropogenic forcing and atmospheric circulation on low-temperature events is important for climate change adaptation and mitigation in the region. This study used observational and model data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 to conduct an extreme event attribution study. The results showed that anthropogenic forcing led to a 1.5-fold decrease in the probability of 2022-like events, with anthropogenic greenhouse gases being the primary contributors to this reduction. Conversely, aerosols slightly increased the likelihood of such events. To evaluate the role of atmospheric circulation in this event, we chose Siberian High as the key circulation system and employed circulation similarity, intensity classification, and regression methods to estimate the impacts of circulation patterns, circulation intensity, and human-induced circulation change. The results demonstrated that under the influence of the same anthropogenic forcing, the presence of an anomalous Siberian High and anomalously enhanced intensity of the Siberian High both increased the likelihood of such a cold event occurrence. However, anthropogenic forcing exerts a negligible effect on such cold events via anomalous circulation.",

Here we analyzed three tipping elements (mountain glacier, snow cover, and permafrost) identified in recent years, evidenced by the facts of frequent occurrence of abrupt massive collapse of glacier mass and the widespread thermakarst of permafrost. Since 2015, strikingly abrupt cryosphere events (ACEs) have been consistently observed over a large range of High Mountain Asia (HMA). Those events were unprecedentedly significant in history, leading to collapses of glaciers following by disconnection of glacier tongue from accumulation basin and recession of thermakarst towards higher elevation. Strong decreasing of snow depth in 2022 was also observed since 2021/2022 winter, coinciding with extreme warming of the year. The widespread high warming rates in the last two decades over HMA might have triggered above ACEs. The dynamic thresholds of ACEs depend largely on high temperature, especially extreme heat wave, for both glaciers and permafrost, closely related to meltwater as a key factor for reaching initial conditions of abrupt changes, suggesting HMA cryosphere is a tipping element under the global warming level of 1.1°C. The ACEs can cause tremendous damage to local ecosystem and socioeconomy, measures to mitigate risks should be taken when the tipping points are reached.",

The comprehensive evaluation of Arctic accessibility for low ice-breaking ships (civil use) in the mid-century is important to support coordinated international decision-making. In this study, the hydrological conditions and navigation potential in key areas and crucial straits along the Northern Sea Route (NSR) and Northwest Passage (NWP) were assessed under Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) using the Polar Operational Limit Assessment Risk Indexing System. The results showed that the most critical areas for navigation in the mid-century (2046‒2055) are the waters around the New Siberian Islands and within the Parry Channel. Arctic navigability improves from SSP1-2.6 to SSP2-4.5 to SSP5-8.5, and the accessibility for PC7 ships under SSP2-4.5 is even better for OW ships under SSP5-8.5. The route on the north side of the New Siberian Islands is a relatively good choice within the NSR, and the southern route has a better navigation potential than the Parry Channel within the NWP. In addition, the accessibility of the Dmitrii Laptev Strait is better than that of the Sannikov Strait at a monthly scale, although the latter has more navigable days. However, there is little difference in accessibility between the eastern and western parts of the Parry Channel. The best navigation potential through the above straits is in September for ordinary ships, and the optimal time window is delayed and extended for PC7 ships. The results can serve as references for policy-making and navigation planning in the Arctic.",

    "abstract": "Many countries are developing national strategies and action plans aimed at minimising the negative impacts of climate change on biodiversity. The purpose of this paper is to provide a brief overview not only of strategies and plans that have been developed in Australia, but also of research that has been carried out in Australia by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Climate Adaptation Flagship to assist the development of future strategies and plans. Major points are summarised from key policy documents such as the National Biodiversity and Climate Change Action Plan 2004–2007, and Australia's Biodiversity Conservation Strategy 2010–2030, as well as the 2009 report on \"Australia's Biodiversity and Climate Change\". Within the first three years of its existence, the Natural Ecosystems theme in CSIRO Climate Adaptation Flagship has carried out studies analysing impacts and identifying potential adaptations across the whole of Australia's vast terrestrial and marine environments. Techniques used in these studies could be applied easily in other countries and could assist the development of more effective national strategies and adaptation action plans for the conservation of biodiversity under climate change.

    "abstract": "This paper aims to provide an overall image in terms of low carbon society (LCS) and its development in China. It mainly introduced and analyzed low carbon development which was addressed as crucial initiative for implementation of LCS in China. A comparative analysis was carried out on concepts and experiences of LCS between China and developed countries. The trends and characteristics of CO2 emissions in China have also been analyzed. Because of large amount of CO2 emissions generated in the production process and relatively small amount of CO2 emissions in the consumption process, China is facing a severe challenge of imbalance in economic growth and CO2 emissions. If the consumption and production pattern of developed countries are duplicated, China is very likely to experience a development pattern of boosting economic growth and improving living standards significantly but meanwhile risking and suffering by large amount of resources consumption and CO2 emissions. Thus, a comprehensive, systematic and scientific scheme for implementing a low carbon society is urgently needed in China. Through literature research, mainstream perspectives of scholars with respect to development of LCS are concluded. In the meantime, CO2 emissions reduction target, carbon taxation and different debated issues are also presented. The achievements, China has made, consist of concrete actions taken by local governments, some new policies and regulations for carbon reduction at national level, in particular energy-saving and renewable energy policies proposed in the 11th Five-Year Plan (2005–2010). Carbon trading markets and carbon capture and starage technology have also made progress in China. There are still many limitations and barriers remaining and in need to be solved in the next steps.

    "abstract": "Process-based models have been widely used to simulate the CH4 budget in natural wetlands, but there are still large uncertainties in the simulation processes. Accuracy analysis of process-based models is important to evaluate the reliability of model estimates for different wetlands. In this study, we analyzed the three sources of the model bias from a process-based model (CH4MODwetland) when simulating CH4 emissions from different wetland sites and types in China. On a national scale, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) decreased from 70.6% at daily scale to 27.1% at annual/seasonal scale. On a national scale, more than 90% of the model errors were from random error. At most of the sites random error contributed more than 60% to the model errors, except the Guangzhou, Haikou, Wuliangsu lake and Yancheng Estuary sites, which showed lower RMSE values. The model simulated higher RMSE at the tidal marsh sites. The model had capability to simulate the daily and annual/seasonal CH4 emissions from all wetland types (model efficiency > 0), and performed better for coastal wetlands than peatlands and marshes, with model efficiency values of 0.75 and 0.99, respectively. When applied the model at annual/seasonal scale for peatlands, marshes, and coastal wetlands, the RMSE decreased a lot. The study indicated that CH4MODwetland is more accurate at annual/seasonal scale than daily scale for different wetland types across China. The non-stochastic portion of CH4 emissions from peatlands, marshes and coastal wetlands can be well predicted by the model.",

    "abstract": "Future electricity consumption may increase due to climate change, but the amplitude depends on the interaction between many uncertain mechanisms. Based on the linear model and policy model, the residential and commercial electricity consumption in Jiangsu province are projected under the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). The linear model considers climate and socioeconomic factors, and the policy model also takes policy factors into account. We find that the cooling degree days (CDD) coefficient is about 3 times of heating degree days (HDD), which reflects that the cooling demand is much larger than heating, and also shows in the projection. The results of the policy model are generally lower than the linear model, which is the impact of policy factors. For example, the SSP1 and SSP2 of the policy model are 320 TW h and 241.6 TW h lower than the linear model in 2100, respectively. At the end of the 21st century, the residential and commercial electricity consumption in Jiangsu province will reach 107.7–937.9 TW h per year, 1.3–11.6 times of 2010. The SSP1 scenario under the policy model is based on feasible assumptions, and can be used as the target scenario for policymakers to establish energy intensity reduction targets.",

    "abstract": "Climate change and ozone depletion are topics challenging the world over and are both attributed mainly to human activities, particularly emissions of ozone depleting substances. One such substance is chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22), a cheap, widely used refrigerant with a high global warming potential and a chemical target for phase-out under the Montreal protocol. Botswana like all signatory countries to the Montreal Protocol is required to develop and implement a country-level Hydrochlorofluorocarbon Phase-out Management Plan (HPMP). This study focused on evaluating the environmental and socioeconomic implications of phasing out HCFC-22 in Botswana. A census of nine HCFC-22-importing companies was conducted and probability sampling proportional to company size was used to select a sample of 159 respondents from the Department of Meteorological Services, Customs officers and HCFC-22 Industrial consumers. Annual HCFC-22 importation figures for Botswana in 2009–2017 from the National Ozone Unit were analysed. It emerged that HCFC-22 phase-out had reduced HCFC-22 consumption by approximately 510,400 kg in 2011–2017, translating to 28,072 ozone depleting potential (ODP) saved. Also, the HCFC-22 phase-out plan saved the country 128 kW h of electricity for 2009–2017. While decreasing demand for HCFC-22, the HPMP had correspondingly occasioned the higher replacement and servicing costs of HCFC-22-compliant equipment, as HCFC-22 substitutes cost more. To deter use of HCFC-22 and promote phase-out, the price of substitute refrigerants can be made less expensive than HCFC-22. Participating stakeholders attest that HCFC-22 phase-out has positive social benefits such as raising community awareness of the ozone depleting phase-out. As a recommendation, the government of Botswana could offer a number of incentives towards HCFC-22 substitutes uptake in order to give impetus to technology transfer.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing concern among central bankers that climate change poses not only serious environmental problems but also a potential economic and financial crisis. This study first confirms a hypothesized theoretical framework with different dimensions of the overall preparedness for climate related financial risk in the Fijian context, and then utilizes this framework to assess the present risk preparedness in Fiji. We tested two Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) models in Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) Framework to analyse the survey data. We evaluated these models using several fit indices. The first CFA model included four correlated latent factors defined by multiple indicators (items) reflecting four hypothesized dimensions. The four latent factors were correlated significantly. The second CFA model included a second-order multi-level constructs reflecting overall preparedness along with four constituent dimensions. The four dimensional factors showed significant and substantial loadings towards overall risk preparedness suggesting that there also exists an overall higher order construct. The model fit indices showed that this second-order CFA model has an acceptable model fit. These results confirm that the four hypothesised dimensions – political leadership (Political), administrative direction (Administration), international standards (Standards) and supervisory mechanisms (Supervision) – are identifiable and distinct aspects. In addition to the four dimensions, the results suggest that overall preparedness should also be tackled in a multi-level integrated manner. The results also reveal that political initiatives would be futile without proper administrative direction and strong supervisory mechanisms. This theoretical framework can also be used to assess financial systems in other developing countries with similar socioeconomic contexts.",

    "abstract": "Even though the biological crusts are critical to dust emissions, no sand and dust forecast model have considered the impacts of the biological crust in dust emission scheme. This situation mainly comes from two scientific difficulties: there is no large scale regional biological crust data available that can be used in the forecast model; there is no quantification of how biological crusts impact on sand emission. In this way, we studied the distribution of biological soil crust in sand and dust storm source areas of Central and East Asia using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite surface reflectance data collected in 2000–2019 to determine its potential impact on dust emission according to two empirical schemes. We further evaluated the relationships between soil crust coverage, roughness length, and dust emission to study SDS source areas. We found that biological crust is widely distributed in SDS source areas of Central and East Asia, with coverage rates of 19.8% in Central Asian deserts, 23.1% in the Gobi Desert, and 17.3%–32.8% in Chinese deserts (p > 0.05). Cyanobacteria and lichen coverage has increased in Chinese deserts, reflecting the recent impacts of the Project of Returning Farmland to Grassland and Farmland to Forests. However, biological soil crust coverage has not increased in Central Asian deserts or the Gobi Desert, and that in Central Asian deserts continues to decrease, demonstrating the complexity of the combined effects of human activities and climate change on its distribution. Biological soil crust increased the roughness length of Central and East Asian SDS source areas by 0.14–0.62 mm. The suppression of dust emission due to biological soil crust did not change among years during the study period. The horizontal and vertical dust flux inhibition coefficient (DFIC) were 2.0–11.0 and 1.7–2.9 (p > 0.05), respectively, clearly showing a suppressive effect. Improvement of the ecological environment in some deserts can lead to the ability of these crusts to inhibit dust erosion errors that must be considered in the dust emission scheme for areas where crust coverage has improved.",

In this study, we first assess how well the MEP algorithm captures the observed variations of turbulent heat fluxes over Arctic sea ice. It is found that the calculated heat fluxes by the MEP method are in good agreement with in-situ observations after considering the absorption of incoming radiation in a snow/ice surface layer with infinitesimal depth. We then investigate the effects of two different schemes (MEP vs. BF) in the sea ice model of CICE6 on simulated turbulent heat fluxes and sea ice processes in the Arctic Basin. Our results show that the two different schemes give quite different representations of seasonal variations of heat fluxes, particularly for sensible heat fluxes in summer. The heat fluxes simulated by the MEP produce weak cooling effect on the ice surface in summer, whereas the BF generates a warming effect. As a result, compared to the BF, the MEP leads to a reduced seasonal cycle of Arctic sea ice mass flux by modulating snow-to-ice conversion, basal ice growth, surface ice melt and basal ice melt.",

    "abstract": "As a key region of Northeast Passage, the polynya along the Siberian coast in the East Siberian and Chukchi Seas is important to local dynamic and thermodynamic processes, sea ice production and marine ecosystem. The detailed variations of polynya and the contributions of atmospheric and oceanic factors to the polynya have not been explored quantitatively. AMSR-E satellite data from January to April during the period 2003–2011 were used to study the impacts of wind stress and ocean heat transport on variations of polynya in the East Siberian Sea and Chukchi Sea. The study region was divided into six domains. Four sets of AMSR-E data with resolutions of 6.25 km and 12.5 km were compared based on two algorithms of sea ice concentration (referred to as 6.25 km-IC and 12.5 km-IC) and sea ice thickness (referred to as 6.25 km-h and 12.5 km-h). The monthly and yearly polynya areas in the four cases and six domains had remarkable differences. The two cases of 6.25 km-h and 12.5 km-h had larger areas of polynya than the other two cases of 6.25 km-IC and 12.5 km-IC. The difference in polynya area between the 6.25 km-h and 12.5 km-h cases was much smaller than the difference between the 6.25 km-IC and 12.5 km-IC cases. The study of atmospheric and oceanic mechanisms on polynya is influenced significantly by the sensitivity of polynya areas. In general, the impact of wind stress and ocean heat transport on the polynyas had noticeable monthly and interannual variations and was dependent on the locations of the polynyas. The alongshore and offshore wind had stronger correlations with the polynya area than ocean heat transport. Although the higher resolution (6.25 km) AMSR-E data are best for the study of atmospheric and oceanic impacts on polynya area, the coarse resolution (12.5 km) AMSR-E data based on sea ice thickness can also be used. Wind direction dominated the polynya area in the East Siberian Sea and wind speed dominated the polynya area in the Chukchi Sea. The variation in ocean heat transport was influenced mainly by variation in volume transport rather than variation in water temperature.",

The study follows a methodology adapted from the research into fair income allocation. The results of these calculations show that there has been vast unfairness surrounding international aviation carbon emissions in the past, and that this unfairness has been partially hidden by a delay in accumulative start dates. A solution to this problem, allowing fair allocation of carbon emissions, is the key to building a mechanism for the reduction of global international aviation emissions. This study proposes a fair method for allocating emission rights, based on a responsibility-capacity index.

It was characterized by suddenness and extremeness and caused severe socio-economic losses. To deepen the understanding of such an urban rainstorm and to improve the forecasting ability, this study revealed the dominant atmospheric circulation and moisture sources for this event. We performed a Lagrangian model FLEXPART to understand this event in terms of moisture sources and transport trajectories. Three key circulation systems affecting this extreme event were identified, including the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH), the low-level southwesterly jet and an anticyclone over northern China. The low-level jet was lifted along the northern dry and cold air mass to form a front, resulting in the heavy rain. The moisture sources located on land contributed about 64% of the moisture. The development of the low-level southwesterly jet in southern China was strengthened near the time of the precipitation occurrence, providing the main moisture supply. Southern China (23°–32.5°N, 98°–122°E) was the most important source region, which contributed the most to the precipitation (43.6%). The results highlight the prominent role of the terrestrial water cycle in this extreme precipitation event over Hubei.",

    "abstract": "Equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is usually defined as the global mean equilibrium temperature response to a doubling CO2 concentration of its preindustrial level in the atmosphere [Hegerl et al., 2007; Meehl et al., 2007]. The pre-industrial concentration of CO2 is generally accepted to be 280×10 −6 and the doubled concentration was considered to be 560×10 accordingly in early studies. New studies tend to use 600×10 instead to stand for the doubled concentration of CO2 around 1900 AD. The initial values of ECS estimated by professionals [Charney et al., 1979], including those reported in IPCC FAR [Mitchell et al., 1990], SAR [Kattenberg et al., 1996] and TAR [Cubasch et al., 2001], were in the range of (3±1.5)◦C or 1.5–4.5◦C. Since IPCC TAR, great many efforts have been made to re-examine the ranges of ECS. As a result, IPCC AR4 [Meehl et al., 2007] offered a comprehensive discussions on this issue and proposed the range of ECS to be 2.0–4.5◦C, which was slightly narrower than previous estimations. Figure 1, derived from IPCC AR4, shows the probability density function of ECS from 10 studies, among which the first 7 results [Forster and Gregory, 2006; Frame et al., 2005; Knutti et al., 2002; Andronova and Schlesinger, 2001; Forest et al., 2002; 2006; Gregory et al., 2002] were from observation-constrained simulations and the other 3 results [Hegerl et al., 2006; von Schneider et al., 2006; Annan et al., 2005] came from Last Glacial Maximum(LGM) and millennia-scale proxy data constrained simulations. It is evident in Figure 1 that the spread of the probability density functions differs widely with the peaks of the curves ranging from around 0.2 to above 0.6 and the broadness of the curves also varies greatly while the mean values of ECS are at 2.0–3.5◦C, which are often greater than the most likely values of ECS (corresponding to the peaks of the probability curves). If should be noted that the uncertainty in estimated ECS mainly comes from the different sources of data that used to constrain the models.

The results show that equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine (EESC) and stratospheric temperature are two important factors influencing the ozone hole. The column ozone at Zhongshan and Syowa stations is significantly related with EESC and stratospheric temperature, which means that even though the two stations are both located on the edge of the ozone hole, EESC and stratospheric temperature still played a very important role in column ozone changes, and mean while verifies that EESC is applicable on the coast of east Antarctic continent. Decadal changes in EESC are similar with those of the ozone hole, and inter-annual variations of ozone are closely related with stratospheric temperature. Based on the relation of EESC and ozone hole size, it can be projected that the ozone hole size will gradually reduce to the 1980’s level from 2010 to around 2070. Of course there might exist many uncertainties in the projection, which therefore needs to be further studied. Bian, L.-G., Z. Lin, X.-D.

Results showed that the MODIS alpine grassland fPAR product, examined by using DCRP, and traditional in situ fPAR observation had a significant relationship at the spatial and temporal scales. The decadal MODIS fPAR trend analysis showed that, average growing season fPAR increased by 1.2 × 10−4 per year and in total increased 0.86% from 2002 to 2011 in alpine grassland, when most of the fPAR increments occurred in southeast and center of the Northern Tibetan Plateau, the alpine grassland tended to recover from degradation slightly. However, climatic factors have influenced the various alpine grassland vegetation fPAR over a period of 10 years; precipitation significantly affected the alpine meadow fPAR in the eastern region, whereas temperature considerably influenced the alpine desert steppe fPAR in the west region. These findings suggest that the regional heterogeneity in alpine grassland fPAR results from various environmental factors, except for vegetation characteristics, such as canopy structure and leaf area.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to use regression modelling, a form of statistical downscaling technique, to predict the daily rainfall occurrence and rainfall amounts for a small river basin, the upper Ping River Basin (UPRB) in northern Thailand. Daily historic (1960–2005) rainfall and a number of daily reanalysis variables (NCEP/NCAR) were used to create regression models that estimate the probabilities of rainfall occurrence (wet days) and amounts (rainfall depth) at each of 29 rain gauge stations located in and around the UPRB. The regression models were calibrated using historic (1960–1989) data and validated using historic (1990–2005) data. Regression models were later applied to historic (1960–2005) GCM outputs (MPI-ESM-LR model) which were adjusted to correspond to the selected reanalysis variables using the Nested Bias Correction (NBC) technique. Rainfall occurrence and amounts were predicted for the periods 2006–2050 and 2051–2100 for RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5 scenarios. Results show that the effects of climate change vary considerably across the catchment, with significantly declines in both the number of wet days and rainfall depth in the wet- and especially the dry-season in the middle of the catchment but obviously increase slightly towards the northern part of the catchment. Since the stepwise regression was used to select the atmospheric variables to form the regression models for simulating rainfall occurrence and amount, different stations have their own predictors and can influence future rainfall to vary significantly between 29 rain gauge stations. If the top three predictors were selected to form the regression models for simulating rainfall occurrence and amount for all stations, the future rainfall characteristics possibly change and can be used to compare with those of presented in this study. It will show either atmospheric predictors or climate change scenarios would have more effect on future rainfall characteristics.",

Results show that the spatial correlation coefficient of AO mode simulated by the decadal experiment is higher than that in the historical experiment. The two groups of experiments reasonably reproduce the characteristics that AO indices are the strongest in winter and the weakest in summer. Compared with historical experiments, the correlation coefficient of the monthly and winter AO indices are higher in the decadal experiments. In particular, the correlation coefficient of monthly AO index between decadal hindcast and observation reached 0.1 significant level. Furthermore, the periodicity of the monthly and spring AO indices are achieved only in the decadal experiments. Therefore, the initial state of model is initialized by using sea temperature data may help to improve the prediction skill of AO in the decadal prediction experiments to some extent.",

The ensemble projection indicates that all the CHTE metrics tend to increase toward the end of the 21st century on the national scale. Besides, the occurrence of CHTE shows a longer month span during the middle and the end of the 21st century (from April to October) compared to the present (from April to September), accompanied with the peaks of the frequency, duration, and cumulative intensity shifting from the present July ahead to June. Relative to 1986–2005, the projected slight, moderate, and extreme CHTEs increase by 55%, 50%, and 50% (58%, 43%, and 60%) during 2046–2065 (2080–2099), respectively; the projected severe CHTE increases by 11% during 2046–2065 while decreases by 11% during 2080–2099. Spatially, the CHTE frequency, duration, and cumulative intensity are projected to increase in a widespread region. The largest increase appears in southern China for the frequency and in Xinjiang and Southeast China for the duration and cumulative intensity. We further divided China into five sub-regions to examine the regional features of CHTE changes. It is found that in addition to the increase of CHTEs in each single sub-region, a pronounced enhancement is also projected for the occurrence of cross-regional CHTEs, particularly for that across more than two sub-regions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The lockdown of large parts of Chinese economy beginning in late January 2020 lead to significant regional changes of aerosol loads, which suggests a reduction of backscatter and consequently a regional warming in the following months. Using local data and a numerical experiment with a limited area model, we have examined how strong this response may have been. The observed (local and reanalysis) observations point to a warming of less than 1.0 K, the simulations to a warming of the order of 0.5 K. These numbers are uncertain, because of large-scale natural variability and an ad-hoc choice of aerosol optical depth anomaly in the simulation. Thus, the result was, in short, that there was actually a weak warming of a few tenth of degrees, while noteworthy changes in circulation or in precipitation were not detected. More specifically, we found that at selected central China stations temperatures were found to be higher than in previous two years. This warming goes with a marked diurnal signal, with a maximum warming in the early afternoon (06 UTC), weakest at night (18 UTC). This may be related to a general warming of large swaths of Asia (including Siberia, which is not related to local aerosol forcing). Indeed, also the stations outside the immediate strong lockdown region are showing warming, albeit a weaker one. Thus, the difference 2020 minus 2019/2018 may overestimate the effect. The ad-hoc series of numerical experiments indicates that the simulated changes are robust and suffer little from internal dynamical variability. In particular, the overall reduction of the aerosol optical depth does not lead to phases of larger intermittent divergence among the model simulations, irrespective of the aerosol load. Instead, the simulations with reduced anthropogenic aerosol load show more a mere locally increased temperature. This may indicate that the aerosol effect is mostly thermodynamic in all local air columns in the region.",

    "abstract": "The throughflow in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) had a significant impact on the North Atlantic Ocean with the Arctic climate change. The findings of physical mechanisms driving the throughflow in the CAA differed and few studies about the impact of sea level pressure (SLP) on the CAA throughflow were made. A high-resolution ice-ocean coupled Arctic Ocean Finite-Volume Community Ocean Model (AO-FVCOM) was used over the period 1978–2016 to examine the interannual and seasonal variability of the outflows in the CAA and the mechanism of SLP in driving the variation of the CAA throughflow quantitively. The simulated volume transport through Davis Strait, Nares Strait, Lancaster Sound and Jones Sound showed consistent increasing trends over 1978–2016 and the larger flux in winter and spring than in summer and fall. The variation of volume transport through Nares Strait contributed more than Lancaster and Jones Sound to the variation through Davis Strait. Five process-oriented experiments were made to further explore the role of SLP in setting up and controlling the sea surface height (SSH) difference and thus the throughflow transport in the CAA. The SLP was a primary forcing to control the SSH difference and the outflow transport compared with the wind forcing. The memory of the SSH to the SLP was short and an equilibrium state could be reached if the SLP varied with time. The upstream and downstream SLP difference, however, made a slight direct contribution to driving the volume transport of the CAA throughflow. In addition to the external forcing of SLP and wind, the variability of the CAA outflow was also influenced by the variability of the inflow/outflow and SSH on boundaries connected to the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The choice of SLP datasets from CORE-v2, ECMWF and NCEP was sensitive to the simulated uncertainty of volume transport.",

There was a significant increasing trend in annual mean temperature for Central China during 1961–2010. The increasing rate was 0.15°C per decade, which was lower than the national trend. Since the mid-1980s, temperature increasing was obvious. Large increasing rate was observed in the mid-eastern part of Central China. For the four seasons, the increasing rate in winter was the largest (0.27°C per decade). The increasing rate in the annual mean minimum temperature was larger than that in the annual mean maximum temperature from 1961 to 2010. As a result, the diurnal range of temperature decreased at the rate of –0.10°C per decade. The extreme high temperature events were increasing while the extreme low temperature events were significantly decreasing. There was no obvious trend in annual precipitation for Central China during 1961–2010. Precipitation in summer and winter significantly increased; change of precipitation in spring was not obvious; precipitation in autumn was decreasing. The decreasing rate of annual rainy days was –3.4 d per decade. The precipitation intensity increased at the rate of 0.25 mm d–1 per decade. Heavy-rain days significantly increased. Spring and summer started earlier while autumn and winter started later. As a result, spring and summer duration was expanding whereas autumn and winter duration shortened. Wan, S.-Q., Y. Gao, B.

    "abstract": "Since the Little Ice Age and as a consequence of climate warming, many recently deglaciated forefields have become and will continue to evolve into large ice-debris complexes exposed to periglacial processes and environment. Such transitional processes have significant implications for geomorphologic shaping and water supply for the downstream communities, especially in arid regions, but our understanding of their evolutionary processes and their potential geomorphic and hydrological impacts is still limited. A landform transition from partly debris-covered glaciers to ice-rich permafrost debris undergoing slow viscous creep was revealed in the Aerzailaikunai Valley in the eastern Tianshan Mountains in China based on the results of in-situ observations and measurements (boreholes, ground temperature monitoring, electrical resistivity tomography surveys, and continuous global positioning system measurements, among others). The internal structure of ice-till mixture contains pure ice layers, supersaturated frozen sands with ice lenses, and ice-bearing blocks with maximum volumetric contents of heterogeneous ice at 35%–60%. Beneath an 1.5-m-thick active layer, permafrost reached far into the underlying bedrock with the mean annual ground temperature of −2.1 °C at the depth of 20 m. The higher surface velocities (with an accumulative displacement of 65 mm from October 2019 to May 2020) and extremely high electrical resistivity (several million Ω m) of the debris-covered glacier margin were in sharp contrast to those of the progressively stabilizing ground surface (up to 16 mm) and the lower zones with relatively smaller electrical resistivity (several thousand Ω m). Combined with the borehole stratigraphy (higher rock content), monitored ground temperatures (permafrost environment), lower electrical resistance (ice-rich moraine), and continuous global positioning system results (viscous creeping), this study documents a transition from glacial to periglacial conditions, materials and processes characteristic of cold-dry ice-clad mountains, and reinforces the theory of the transition from debris-covered glaciers into morainically originated rock glaciers.",

In most areas of the QTP, the increase in UTCI leads to an increased number of comfortable days. Spatial distribution and temporal change in the number of comfortable days are found to be principally related to altitude. In areas within altitudes of 3000–4500 m, the number of comfortable days increases by up to 6 d per decade, which is faster than that in higher elevation areas above 4500 m. Results also indicate that thermal comfortable condition has improved in areas of 2500–5000 m (medium to high altitude), particularly in spring and autumn. Further research indicates that population distribution also shows a regional clustering feature, with the majority of residents residing in cities and their vicinities, where a higher number of comfortable days were observed. Most areas with a greater number of comfortable days have experienced a more significant increase in population under thermal comfortable conditions. It implies that climate change more likely has a large influence on population in the QTP. These findings are expected to enhance tourism development and the assessment of the impact on the living environment. The findings can be helpful for optimizing of tourism development and better understanding how climate change affects population distribution.",

However, the frozen ground in this corridor has great impacts on the infrastructure stability, especially under the background of climate warming and permafrost degradation. Based on the Bayesian Network Model (BNM), this study evaluates the suitability for engineering construction in the CMREC, by using 21 factors in five aspects of terrain, climate, ecology, soil, and frozen-ground thermal stability. The results showed that the corridor of Mongolia's Gobi and Inner Mongolia in China is suitable for engineering construction, and the corridor in Amur, Russia near the northern part of Northeast China is also suitable due to cold and stable permafrost overlaying by a thin active layer. However, the corridor near Petropavlovsk in Kazakhstan and Omsk in Russia is not suitable for engineering construction because of low freezing index and ecological vulnerability. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis of influence factors indicates that the thermal stability of frozen ground has the greatest impact on the suitability of engineering construction. These conclusions can provide a reference basis for the future engineering planning, construction and risk assessment.",

    "abstract": "Decarbonisation is a complex systemic issue that involves multiple market failures. Thus, the integrated application of multiple policy instruments is required. This study used the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) method to explore the causality relationship between decarbonisation policies with reference to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the decoupling elasticity of Tapio from a configuration perspective. We found that taxation and regulation are the critical drivers of decoupling, while information and public goods and services are ancillary. Three decoupled policy mixes were tabled, each focusing on a) taxation, b) taxation and economic instruments, and c) trading system and regulations. In contrast, the execution of information and voluntary instruments, as well as the non-implementation of the tax, are essential to non-decoupling. Three combinations that are negative for decoupling were also introduced: a) trade and economic incentives, b) trade, information and voluntary instruments, and c) information, public goods and services, and voluntary instruments. The most valuable policy mix for China is the implementation of taxes, trade, economic and regulations with the provision of auxiliary decarbonised information and public goods and services. The following processes are involved: a) integrate regulations with economic policies for more flexibility; b) introduce the carbon tax and a tax rebate policy to complement the carbon market policy based on research into the feasibility and cost-effectiveness; c) provide information and public services mainly on the consumption side; and d) recommend voluntary policies for innovative practices. On the basis of more cases and a configuration perspective, this study offers various policy mixes that are conducive or not to decoupling and suggestions for optimising China's decarbonisation policy. We also offered a way to measure the intensity of the decarbonisation policy with respect to the carbon emission structure of sectors.",

However, current algorithms are highly affected by snow cover and complex land cover types, compromising their performance. Therefore, this study proposes an improved algorithm for daytime detection of diurnal F/T states by using Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 data. In the daytime F/T discrimination algorithm, a microwave spectral gradient index is applied to divide the surface into snow-covered and snow-free areas. In the snow-free area, the surface temperature index is optimised to improve the accuracy of the standard deviation method (SDM) in evaluating the accuracy of the F/T state. For the nighttime dataset, the microwave standard deviation index difference values between day and night are used to detect the F/T states based on the daytime results. The accuracy of the improved algorithm reaches 88.6% and 84.5% in the daytime and at nighttime, respectively. Compared with the SDM, the accuracy is improved by 10.2% in the daytime and 5.4% at nighttime. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is able to effectively distinguish the F/T states of snow-covered surfaces. Optimising the surface temperature index can significantly improve the accuracy of the SDM. The results reveal that the proposed surface F/T detection algorithm can be applied to regions with complex land cover types.",

    "abstract": "The Pan-Third Pole region comprises multiple nations affected by climate vulnerability and energy inequality, wherein promoting energy transitions in rural households would provide a path to combat climate change. Identifying the factors that drive rural household energy consumption and the transition is important. This study performed a micro-survey of 1060 rural households in five countries in the Pan-Third Pole region and empirically analyzed the relationships between off-farm income, energy consumption, and energy transitions. The off-farm income of rural households was found to have a significantly positive effect (p < 0.01) on energy expenditure, indicating that energy expenditure increased with increasing off-farm income. Off-farm income has a significantly positive effect (p < 0.01) on the proportion of commercial energy but a significantly negative effect on the proportion of noncommercial energy. These results indicate that increasing off-farm income can adjust the energy consumption structure of rural households. Furthermore, a robustness check by substituting independent variables, instrumental variable method (IV), and propensity score matching method (PSM) provided strong evidence to prove the robustness of the results. The heterogeneity analysis showed that the effects of off-farm income on energy expenditure and transitions differed among countries, off-farm income had no significant impact on energy expenditure in Cambodia and Myanmar, but it worked for China, Nepal, and Thailand. Finally, policy implications are proposed to promote energy transition in the Pan-Third pole region: providing more full-time or part-time off-farm employment opportunities, employment assistance or skill training by local governments; increasing the pace of infrastructure construction to solve energy inaccessibility; multiple measures to promote the education and environmental knowledge.",

The model is soft-linked with a bottom-up technology‒rich regional model of the CLEW sectors in Costa Rica. A robust decision-making-inspired approach is taken to assess the effects of uncertainty on the estimations. The study addresses a literature gap in modeling subnational employment while accounting for long-term uncertainty and allows to identify economic activities affected by the transformation, so that policies regarding a just transition can be properly developed and stakeholders incentivized to take active participation in the process. Under baseline assumptions, a net-zero economy would have 135 thousand more jobs by 2050 than the BAU, equivalent to 7% of the employed population in 2017. Energy-related jobs would triple by mid-21st century, and regions capitalizing on renewables would perceive the highest gain. When considering uncertainty, the net jobs range between 35‒750 thousand. Since net positive outcomes in terms of jobs are feasible, global governance should focus efforts on policies that enhance these.",

The following problems in China were found to be associated with convention implementation: 1) shortage of coordination among implementing organization; 2) the existing strategic plans lack planning for synergistic implementation; 3) the monitoring system lacks coordination management, thus making the sharing of monitoring results among each unit challenging; and 4) information sharing from partner ministries is inadequate. Combining the status of China's implementation and the experience of other contracting parties, the following strategies are proposed: 1) a synergistic implementation mechanism should be established at the national level; 2) a national strategic plan should be developed for synergistic implementation; 3) a monitoring system and management mechanism should be developed that comprehensively consider the monitoring indicators of each convention; and 4) an implementation information-sharing platform should be built.",

    "abstract": "The terrestrial cryosphere functions to provide critical freshwater and serve societies and ecosystems, driving nature's contributions to people (NCP). This becomes increasingly important for the oasis areas in Northwest China. The cryospheric meltwater is in demand to support the economy and reduce poverty, accompanied by growing requirements to protect the environment. We intend to investigate the contributions of cryospheric meltwater by analyzing the spatial functions and services pertinent to provisioning meltwater in China. Based on the currently available datasets during the 2000s of glaciers, snow cover, and permafrost, spatial clustering was utilized to analyze the contributions at the third-level basin scale. Further assessment is carried out for the exposure of primary, secondary, and tertiary industrial sectors to cryospheric meltwater, which reflects the spatiality of potential services that cryospheric meltwater may provide. In results, we spatially cluster the contribution of cryospheric meltwater into six function zones and twenty-seven sub-zones, in association with the degree of their reliance on glaciers, snow cover, and permafrost. Considering the sector's exposure, we further spatially cluster the contribution areas into eleven service zones concerning the potential service of cryospheric meltwater. Generally, the cryosphere contributes approximately 8.3% of the total water resource in China, with function zones mainly distributed in northeastern China, Qinghai−Tibet Plateau (QTP), and other arid regions of Northwest China with various significance. The overall contribution ratios of the glacier, snow cover, and permafrost to cryospheric meltwater are about 35.6%, 56.5%, and 7.9%, respectively. By looking into the service zones, the cryospheric meltwater mainly contributes to the primary industry in Northwest China and QTP, even though it has less significant effects on all other industrial sectors, while the services to the ecosystem are mainly located in QTP and high mountain regions. The results offer an overarching view on the contributions of cryospheric meltwater in China.",

The activities of TPVs are closely related to TP's water source, which supplies fresh water to millions of people in Asia. Projection of the TPVs can increase understanding about the future of water supply in Asia under global warming. In this study, the possible activities of TPVs under 1.5 °C and 2 °C warming scenarios above the pre-industrial level are evaluated through the NCAR CESM (Community Earth System Model) Low-warming (CESM-LW) Experiments. The results show that the CESM-LW well reproduces the spatio-temporal characteristics of TPVs in the historical run from 1985 to 2000. The CESM-LW suggests TPVs in warm season (May–September) increase by 15% due to the additional 0.5 °C warming by the end of this century (2071–2100). It implies the greater importance of TPVs to the precipitation over the TP in the future. The changes of TPVs are closely related to the large-scale circulations adjustments. The additional 0.5 °C warming strengthens the temperature difference between the TP and its surrounding areas, which results in an enhanced convergence near the TP's surface and divergence in the upper troposphere by about −0.1 × 10−6 and 0.22 × 10−6 s−1, respectively. The assessment of future TPVs provides a synoptic dynamic perspective on the climate change of precipitation and water resources.",

However, the impact of carbon quota auctions on renewable energy generation has not been sufficiently discussed. The main purpose of this study is to investigate whether China can rely on quota auctions to increase renewable energy generation in the short term, and to demonstrate which is more effective in promoting renewable energy development, policy enforcement or auction constraints? The improved neo-trans-log production model, the multi-objective linear programming model and the dispatch heuristic were used to predict additional emission reduction cost, optimized power mix with different auctioning rates, with economic development, technological progress and the unique characteristics of China's power generation industry being taken into consideration. The results show that the auctioning rate will have little influence on the optimized energy production structure, especially on the share of renewable energy resources; when the total on-grid electricity generation ranges from 7625 to 7926 billion kW h and the auctioning rate ranges from 0% to 5%, policy enforcement will influence the generation of renewable energy to a greater extent than auctioning in the near future.",

    "abstract": "Change related to climate in Macao was studied on the basis of daily temperature observations over the period 1901–2007. The result shows that annual mean surface air temperature in Macao as a whole rose with a warming rate of about 0.066 °C per 10 years in the recent 107 years. The most evident warming occurred in spring and winter. The interdecadal variations of the seasonal mean temperature in summer and winter appeared as a series of waves with a time scale of about 30 years and 60 years, respectively. The annual mean minimum temperature increased about twice as fast as the annual mean maximum temperature, resulting in a broad decline in the annual mean diurnal range. The interdecadal variations of annual mean maximum temperature are obviously different from those of annual mean minimum temperature. It appears that the increase in the annual mean maximum temperature in the recent 20 years may be part of slow climate fluctuations with a periodicity of about 60 years, whereas that in the annual mean minimum temperature appears to be the continuation of a long-term warming trend.

    "abstract": "Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities can allow Annex I parties in the Kyoto Protocol to decrease their carbon emission reduction pressure, and comparably expanding more emission space for their domestic industries and energy production. The loopholes resulted from LULUCF activity types and specific accounting methods are always argued among the different parties, particularly including harvested wood products, influences of force majeure, threshold values of the reference level, and gross-net or net-net accounting methods. For estimating uncertainties in accounting loopholes, and to avoid that developed countries take advantage of the accounting loopholes of LULUCF to decrease their emission reduction pressure, the LULUCF data submitted from the main developed countries in Annex I, including EU 27, Canada, Japan, and Russia, were collected. According to the analysis of these data, the loopholes influence the accounting results of LULUCF. The results show that the uncertainty of harvested wood products is excessive. The carbon sink produced by LULUCF activities will increase averagely by at least 30% without force majeure. The threshold values of the reference level of carbon sink should be set to a higher level. The net-net accounting method might be more suitable for LULUCF after 2012. Liu, S., Y. Li, Q.

    "abstract": "In essence, international climate negotiation is a serious and responsible global effort, despite various conflicts, to establish a rational international climate regime. In essence, tackling climate changes is leading the globe to actualize sustainable development of all humankind along the low-carbon, green, and cyclic-development path. Thus, climate negotiation should be driving all parties to achieve a global climate regime arrangement in a constructive way. Therefore, this paper suggests focusing on the following three major recommendations: early developed countries take the lead in committing positively to absolute emission reduction; the developing countries contribute according to their abilities and stages of development; the developed countries perform real deeds using their funds and technology. Based on substantial breakthrough that would be made, progressive supplement and improvement could be accomplished through the mechanism of review and adjustment under the Convention framework. This path represents a combination of bottom-up and top-down. The ultimate way out of international climate negotiation lies in win-win cooperation. Profound reasons for China to participate proactively and practically in international climate negotiation, based on its actual conditions, are the internal wants and needs of its scientific and sustainable development, as well as the undertaking of international responsibilities as a responsible, large, developing country.",

In addition, future extreme precipitation indices in the middle and late 21st century are projected. The results show that simulation capability of the HadCM3 for regional climate characteristics can be effectively improved by the downscaling approach, with 30%–100% reduction of the relative errors of the climatological mean state of extreme precipitation indices. However, the downscaling results still show wetter winter and dryer summer than the observation. Under the SRES A1B emission scenario, frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events are projected to increase, and the estimated increasing rate is higher for extreme precipitation indices than for mean precipitation index; and in summer than in winter.

Using data from a representative sample of Beijing's urban population, it is shown that people living at a distance perceive nonuse values of climate change adaptation measures aimed at improving the environmental conditions in the Tarim River Basin in Northwest China. Using the contingent valuation method the monetized benefit of a particular set of climate adaptation measures experienced by a Beijing household is approximated.

Understanding the characteristics and variations of landfast ice is crucial to the study of climates and field activities in Antarctic. In this study, a high-resolution thermodynamic snow-ice (HIGHTSI) model was applied to simulate the seasonal changes of landfast ice along the Mawson Coast, East Antarctica, through ERA-Interim reanalysis data. Four ocean heat-flux (Fw) values (10, 15, 20 and 25 W m−2) were used in sensitivity experiments. The results showed that it is reasonable to simulate landfast ice using the HIGHTSI model, and the simulation of landfast ice thickness matched best well with field measurements when Fw was 20 W m−2. Then, 2-D distributions of landfast ice from 2006 to 2018 were modeled by HIGHTSI with 2-D ERA-Interim reanalysis data in a 0.125° × 0.125° cell grid as external forcing. The results showed that fast ice was thicker along the coast and thinner near open water, and usually reaches its maximal thickness in October, varying from 1.2 to 2.0 m through the study area. There was no statistical trend for the thickness during the study period.",

    "abstract": "The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is characterized by heavily local dust activities, however, the mechanism of interannual variations of winter dust frequency over the TP remain poorly understood. Previous studies showed the autumn Arctic sea ice could significantly influence the winter climate over Eurasia. Whether autumn sea ice affects winter dust activity over the TP or not? Here, we used an integrated surface database to investigate possible mechanisms for interannual variability in the frequency of winter dust events above the TP. This variability, which is thought to be mainly caused by local dust emissions, shows significant correlations with sea ice concentration (SIC) in the Barents and Kara Seas during the preceding autumn. Low Barents–Kara SIC is accompanied by reduced snow depth over northern Eurasia between autumn and winter, which can enhance the Eurasian mid-latitude westerly jet stream. This strengthening increases the cyclogenesis and occurrence of strong surface wind speeds in winter, especially over the TP. In addition, a lower SIC is closely associated with reduced precipitation and snow cover in late autumn and winter over the TP, which in turn enhances warming of the land surface and reduces the area of frozen ground. These anomalies in atmospheric circulation patterns and local surface conditions promote dust events above the TP during winter. The ensemble means of Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project experiments from Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project and the Community Atmosphere Model version 4 can generally reproduce the atmospheric circulation anomalies associated with decreased Barents–Kara SIC. This study reveals the crucial effect that SIC anomalies in the Barents and Kara Seas have on winter dust activities over the TP.",

    "abstract": "Given the difficulties in rescuingand ensuring the quality of long-term climate data, current studies on century-scale climate change are usually limited to annual and monthly data, resulting in the poor detection of extreme climate events and their changes before 1950. In this study, we reconstructed a daily precipitation series for Tianjin from 15 September 1887 to 31 December 2022 on the basis of the most comprehensive daily precipitation records collected from the Tianjin Meteorological Archive, China, and in reference to the precipitation analysis results based on the datasets developed by the Climatic Research Unit Time-Series version 4.06, Global Precipitation Climatology Centre and University of Delaware along with the application of various homogenisation methods for climate series. Our approach provides a complete and reliable century-long daily precipitation series for the study of regional or local extreme weather and climate events. The reconstructed daily dataset reveals that the annual precipitation amount and R95 intensity in Tianjin during 1888–2022 lack significant trends and have values of 0.74 ± 6.99 and −1.84 ± 3.22 mm per decade, respectively. On the annual and seasonal scales, the precipitation amount and R95 intensity, particularly those in autumn, have increased since the latter half of the 20th century relative to those in 1888–1950. However, the increase in precipitation amount and R95 intensity is relatively limited compared with that in atmospheric water vapour content due to surface warming, indicating the highly sensitive response of extreme precipitation events to warming. In addition, the estimates for the return periods of 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 years covering 1888–2022, 1888–1950 and 1951–2022 depict that the intensity of heavy rain and above magnitude and was highest in 1888–1950 and decreased in 1951–2022.",

Due to reduced inflow from the Kherlen River, Hulun Lake experienced rapid shrinkage at the beginning of the 21st century, posing a serious threat to the ecological security of northern China. However, there is still a significant lack of projections regarding future climate change and its hydrological response in the Kherlen River basin. This study analyzed the projected climate and streamflow changes in the Kherlen River basin, a vital yet vulnerable international semi-arid steppes type basin. A combination of multi-model ensemble projection techniques, and the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model was employed to examine the spatio‒temporal changes in precipitation, temperature, streamflow, and the associated uncertainties in the basin. The temperature (an increase of 1.84‒6.42 °C) and the precipitation (an increase of 15.0‒46.0 mm) of Kherlen River basin are projected to increase by 2100, leading to a rise in streamflow (1.08‒4.78 m3 s−1). The upstream of the Kherlen River exhibits remarkable increasing trends in precipitation, which has a dominant influence on streamflow of Kherlen River. Noteworthy increases in streamflow are observed in April, August, September, and October compared to the reference period (1971‒2000). These findings suggest a partial alleviation of water scarcity in the Kherlen River, but also an increased likelihood of hydrological extreme events. The projected temperature increase in the Kherlen River basin exhibits the smallest uncertainty, while more pronounced uncertainties are found in precipitation and streamflow. The spread among the results of CMIP6 models is greater than that of CMIP5 models, with lower Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) values for temperature, precipitation, and streamflow.",

Thus, the possible relationship between the observed changes in the warm and cold spell duration (WSDI and CSDI) in hotspot regions during 1960–2014 and human influence was investigated based on the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis version 1 and Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) data.

The optimal fingerprinting technique was used to compare observed changes in WSDI and CSDI to simulated changes averaged across eight CMIP6 models. Results show that anthropogenic (ANT) forcing contributed to the observed increase in WSDI in the three hotspot regions (West Asia, South Asia and Southeast Asia), with the majority of the changes being attributed to greenhouse gas forcing. However, a generally weak ANT signal can be observed in the decreasing trend of CSDI and can be detected in South and Southeast Asia. The influence of aerosol forcing remains undetected in either WSDI or CSDI, which differs from the results for frequency and intensity of extreme temperatures. The attribution results revealed that the constrained projection of WSDI is lower than the raw projection for 2015‒2100 in West Asia and Southeast Asia. However, no differences in future CSDI changes are found in Southeast Asia between the constrained and raw projections.",

    "abstract": "Mid-high latitude Northern Asia is one of the most vulnerable and sensitive areas to global warming, but relatively less studied previously. We used an ensemble of a regional climate model (RegCM4) projections to assess future changes in surface air temperature, precipitation and Köppen‒Trewartha (K‒T) climate types in Northern Asia under the 1.5‒4 °C global warming targets. RegCM4 is driven by five CMIP5 global models over an East Asia domain at a grid spacing of 25 km. Validation of the present day (1986‒2005) simulations shows that the ensembles of RegCM4 (ensR) and driving GCMs (ensG) reproduce the major characters of the observed temperature, precipitation and K‒T climate zones reasonably well. Greater and more realistic spatial detail is found in RegCM4 compared to the driving GCMs. A general warming and overall increases in precipitation are projected over the region, with these changes being more pronounced at higher warming levels. The projected warming by ensR shows different spatial patterns, and is in general lower, compared to ensG in most months of the year, while the percentage increases of precipitation are maximum during the cold months. The future changes in K‒T climate zones are characterized by a substantial expansion of Dc (temperature oceanic) and retreat of Ec (sub-arctic continental) over the region, reaching ∼20% under the 4 °C warming level. The most notable change in climate types in ensR is found over Japan (∼60%), followed by Southern Siberia, Mongolia, and the Korean Peninsula (∼40%). The largest change in the K‒T climate types is found when increasing from 2‒3 °C. The results will help to better assess the impacts of climate change and in implementation of appropriate adaptation measures over the region.",

    "abstract": "Numerical models serve as an essential tool to investigate the causes and effects of Arctic sea ice changes. Evaluating the simulation capabilities of the most recent CMIP6 models in sea ice volume flux provides references for model applications and improvements. Meanwhile, reliable long-term simulation results of the ice volume flux contribute to a deeper understanding of the sea ice response to global climate change. In this study, the sea ice volume flux through six Arctic gateways over the past four decades (1979–2014) were estimated in combination of satellite observations of sea ice concentration (SIC) and sea ice motion (SIM) as well as the Pan-Arctic Ice-Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS) reanalysis sea ice thickness (SIT) data. The simulation capability of 17 CMIP6 historical models for the volume flux through Fram Strait were quantitatively assessed. Sea ice volume flux simulated from the ensemble mean of 17 CMIP6 models demonstrates better performance than that from the individual model, yet IPSL-CM6A-LR and EC-Earth3-Veg-LR outperform the ensemble mean in the annual volume flux, with Taylor scores of 0.86 and 0.50, respectively. CMIP6 models display relatively robust capability in simulating the seasonal variations of volume flux. Among them, CESM2-WACCM performs the best, with a correlation coefficient of 0.96 and a Taylor score of 0.88. Conversely, NESM3 demonstrates the largest deviation from the observation/reanalysis data, with the lowest Taylor score of 0.16. The variability of sea ice volume flux is primarily influenced by SIM and SIT, followed by SIC. The extreme large sea ice export through Fram Strait is linked to the occurrence of anomalously low air temperatures, which in turn promote increased SIC and SIT in the corresponding region. Moreover, the intensified activity of Arctic cyclones and Arctic dipole anomaly could boost the southward sea ice velocity through Fram Strait, which further enhance the sea ice outflow.",

    "abstract": "Snow density is one of the basic properties used to describe snow cover characteristics, and it is critical for remote sensing retrieval, water resources assessment and modeling inputs. There are many instruments available to measure snow density in situ. However, there are measurement errors of snow density for bulk and layers or gravimetric and electronic instruments, which may affect the accuracy of remote sensing retrieval and model simulation. Especially in China, due to the noticeable heterogeneity of snowpacks, it is necessary to evaluate in detail the performance and applicability of snow density instruments in different snowpack conditions. This study evaluated the performance of different snow density instruments: the Federal Sampler, the model VS–43 snow density cylinder (VS–43), the wedge snow density cutter (WC1000 and WC250), and the Snow Fork. The average bulk snow density of all instrument measurements was set as the reference value for evaluation. The results showed that as compared with the reference, the VS–43 cylinder presented the best performance for bulk snow density measurement in the measured range with the lowest RMSE (11 kg m−3), BIAS (3 kg m−3), and MRE (1.6%). For layer observation, bulk snow density was overestimated by 8.1% with WC1000 and underestimated by 11.4% with Snow Fork which was the worst performance compared with the reference value, and there were greater measurement errors of snow density in the depth hoar than other snow layers. Compared with grassland, the uncertainty of snow density measurements was slightly lower in forests. Overall, the Federal Sampler and VS–43 cylinder are more suitable for bulk snow density measurement in deep snowpack regions across China, and it is recommended to use WC1000, WC250 and Snow Fork to measure the snow density of snow layers in the snow stratigraphy.",

    "abstract": "Pine Island Glacier (PIG), the largest glacier in the Amundsen Sea Embayment of West Antarctica, has contributed to over a quarter of the observed sea level rise around Antarctica. In recent years, multiple observations have confirmed its continuous retreat, ice flow acceleration and profound surface melt. Understanding these changes is crucial for accurately monitoring ice mass discharge and future Antarctic contributions to sea level rise. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the complex interactions between these variables to comprehend how they collectively affect the overall stability of the intricate PIG system. In this study, we utilized high-resolution remote sensing data and deep learning method to detect and analyze the spatio-temporal variations of surface melt, ice shelf calving, and ice flow velocity of the PIG from 2015 to 2023. We explored the correlations among these factors to understand their long-term impacts on the glacier's stability. Our findings reveal a retreat of 26.3 km and a mass loss of 1001.6 km2 during 2015–2023. Notably, extensive surface melting was observed, particularly in the 2016/2017 and 2019/2020 melting seasons. Satellite data vividly illustrate prolonged and intense melting periods, correlating with a significant retreat in the glacier's terminus position in 2019/2020. Furthermore, the comprehensive analysis of surface melting and the cumulative retreat of the ice shelf from 2017 to 2020 on the PIG shows a temporal relationship with subsequent significant changes in ice flow velocity, ranging from 10.9 to 12.2 m d−1, with an average acceleration rate of 12%. These empirical findings elucidate the intricate relationship among surface melt, ice flow velocity, and consequential glacier dynamics. A profound understanding of these interrelationships holds paramount importance in glacier dynamic changes and modeling, providing invaluable insights into potential glacier responses to global climate change.",

Results show that both the extreme sensitivity and sensitivity under current climate are higher in the edge than in the central area of the QTP. There exists a strong negative correlation between station's elevation and critical temperature, at which the sensitivity reaches extremum. The negative correlation between the elevation and the extreme sensitivity is not as strong as the former one. Currently, the climatological temperatures in quite a few stations do not reach the critical stage. The sensitivity at these stations will become greater under the current background of climate warming, which means NSCDs will be more sensitive to surface air temperature. Ma, L., D. Qin, L.

Among the factors contributing to these important issues, the role of air pollution in global and regional climate warming remains as one of the largest uncertainties. On the basis of understanding of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, specifically, in the role of air pollution in climate change, scenarios establishment, and relationship between the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Weaknesses and reflections were discussed here especially in strengthening impact, adaptation and mitigation research that related with changes in air pollution and climate. In the future, there are needs to in-depth understand how and why the air pollution in China is so serious and changing; to understand the likely future changes in air pollution and climate; to strengthen comprehensive impact research and selective reduction strategies related to changes in air pollution and climate. Furthermore, this study outlines the needs to develop strategies to close the loop of differential impacts and costs; to establish co-benefits and sustainable development goals, to identify the crucial risks and options for synergies/trade-offs; to integrate sector-specific details with macro-economics, and to integrate the assessments of the various policy instruments. All these focus areas will help to facilitate the transition of economic development patterns towards green and low-carbon development.",

    "abstract": "It is important to identify atmospheric environmental drivers of childhood asthma because asthma is the most common chronic disease in children globally. We provided an overview of the impacts of exposure to atmospheric environmental factors (e.g., meteorological factors and air pollutants) on childhood asthma, based on a series of studies with the cutting-edge environmental epidemiological methodology in Shanghai, China. Overall, we found that the prevalence of asthma among the children aged 3‒7 years had increased by approximately 7 fold, from 2.1% in 1990 to 14.6% in 2019. Most meteorological factors (i.e. daily mean temperature, temperature difference, air pressure, air pressure difference, precipitation, relative humidity, sunshine and wind speed) and air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2 and O3) were significantly associated with childhood asthma (p < 0.05), but meteorological factors appeared to play more important roles than air pollutants in the occurrence of asthma exacerbations. We also found that temperature variability was significantly associated with the elevated relative risk of daily outpatient visits for childhood asthma (p < 0.05). Furthermore, we conducted a systematic review on climate change adaptation measures and childhood asthma and found that there were a number of adaptation measures proposed for childhood asthma in response to climate change, including vulnerability assessment, improving ventilation and heating, enhancing community education, developing forecast models, and early warning systems. However, the effectiveness of most adaptation measures, except for improving ventilation and heating in winter, have not been explored and quantified. Since asthma is sensitive to the variation of atmospheric environmental conditions, it is critical to develop and implement appropriate climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies as global heating becomes apparent.",

    "abstract": "From 26 November to 1 December 2022, intense cold air masses swept across China from northwest to south, resulting in a nationwide cold air outbreak (CAO) case characterised by drastic and sudden temperature drops with rain, snow and strong winds. The physical processes that dominate the intensification of the cold air masses during this CAO event remain unclear. In this study, the evolution of the CAO case, which is indicated by the dry static energy (DSE), is investigated using a novel approach in the framework of Lagrangian backtracking. The dominant processes can be identified by decomposing the DSE change into four diabatic heating terms due to shortwave radiation, longwave radiation, latent heat and turbulent processes. Overall, in this case, most of the cold air parcels originated from the east of Novaya Zemlya and crossed Central Siberia before reaching China. Thus, these air parcels mainly manifested on the northwest‒southeast path. The duration of the cold air intensification differed between subregions. The cold air parcels experienced long cooling periods (approximately 9 d) before reaching northern China (i.e. Northwest, North and Northeast China), whilst the southern parts (i.e. Central, East and South China) underwent relatively short cooling periods (6–8 d). Accordingly, the cold air affecting northern China is more intense than that affecting the southern parts, especially for East and South China. For all six subregions, longwave radiative cooling is identified as the dominant contributor to the cold air intensification, and the latent heat processes as the secondary contributor. The weakening of cold air parcels as they approach and pass over these regions is driven by turbulent processes and shortwave heating. Central Siberia and Lake Baikal are identified as key areas for the intensification of cold air passing over both regions. In addition, air parcels affecting Northwest China are intensely cooled as they pass over the Junggar Basin, while the North China Plain is a key area for cooling air parcels reaching Central, East and South China. From a Lagrangian perspective, these findings provide insights into the physical processes driving the behaviour of cold air parcels, which would help understand the mechanisms involved in the past changes and future projections in CAOs.",

Therefore, previous researchers have developed many adjustment methods for all precipitation types on different time scales. However, which adjustment method is suitable for T-200BM3 weighing gauge wind-induced error adjustment in harsh alpine regions is unclear. Therefore, precipitation measurement intercomparison experiments were conducted in the Qilian Mountains from July 2018 to July 2021, and eight adjustment methods;were evaluated for wind-induced errors for daily, individual precipitation event, hourly, and half-hourly time scales. Z2004 outperformed the other adjustment methods in regard to the daily measurements of snow and mixed precipitation. Regarding individual snowfall events, M2007 reduced the absolute value of RMSE (bias) from 1.44 to 1.32 mm (0.77 to 0.24 mm) and could be recommended for snowfall event adjustment. K2017-1 attained a better performance than K2017-2 in regard to half-hourly snowfall and mixed sample adjustment and was more suitable for half-hourly snowfall sample adjustment. K2017-1 reduced the absolute value of bias from 0.07 to 0.00 mm for snowfall. Finally, Z2004, M2007, and K2017-1 yielded better adjustment results for the daily accumulation precipitation amount (>2 mm d−1), individual snowfall events (>2 mm per event), and half-hourly accumulation snowfall or mixed samples (>1 mm 30 min−1), respectively. However, further intercomparison in different climate regions is needed for trace precipitation samples.",

    "abstract": "China's glacier water resources (GWRs) are not only indispensable suppliers of fresh water for humans living in large domestic areas but also affect the water supply to downstream neighbouring countries. Therefore, it is crucial to systematically evaluate the spatiotemporal (mis-) matches between the supply and demand potentials of China's GWRs and the combined supply and demand effects in the 21st century to enable regional sustainable development. To facilitate such research, in this study, we first regionalized the importance of China's GWRs in terms of the supply potential and downstream human dependence to reveal the spatial (mis-) matches between supply and demand potentials. Then, changes in the service potential of glacier meltwater and in population dynamics, as well as their temporal (mis-) matches and associated opportunities and risks, were further assessed at the river basin scale. The results showed that GWR plays an important role in 4 of 16 macroscale glacier-fed basins (i.e., Tarim, Junggar, Ili, and Zangxi) and 11 of 37 subbasins within the China region due to higher supply potential and demand potential in those basins. The importance of China's GWRs increases dramatically when taking the demand potential of downstream countries into account, especially in the Ganges and Indus river basins. The peaks in meltwater runoff from the most glacierized basins of the eastern Tianshan Mountains, eastern Qilian Mountains, and southeastern Tibetan Plateau of China occur slightly earlier than the projected peak population (around 2030) under the mid-range Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP245), leading to a compound risk in terms of decreasing meltwater supply and increasing human dependence at the end of the 2020s. However, the peak meltwater is expected to occur later than the peak population in the Tarim, Qiangtang Plateau, and Qaidam basins. The opportunities offered by the increase in meltwater can relieve the water resource pressure for those populations under water-stressed conditions. Greater attention should also be paid to water shortage risks in the transboundary river basins, especially in the Indus and Ganges basins, because the peak meltwater within China is generally expected to occur sooner than the projected peak population of downstream countries. This study provides an effective planning and decision-making basis for the full utilization of China's GWRs and adaptation when glacier runoff declines.",

    "abstract": "The amount and distribution of precipitation can determine dengue risk by affecting mosquito breeding; however, previous studies failed to incorporate this bivariate characteristic to examine dengue fever transmission. In the present research, nationwide data on daily dengue cases in China between January 2005 and December 2020 were obtained, and the top 12 cities accounting for 78% of total cases were selected for analysis. Precipitation patterns were quantified by weekly precipitation and precipitation concentration degree (PCD). On the basis of the combinations of both parameters, the exposure-response relationships of precipitation with dengue risk were established using generalised additive models, and the high-dengue-risk thresholds of precipitation patterns were further identified. Dengue burden was assessed by calculating attributable dengue cases. For the same amount of precipitation, the dispersed precipitation in the pre-summer rainy season leads to a higher dengue risk in autumn. The weekly precipitation of 100–150 mm and PCD of 0.2–0.4 constitute the highest risk scenario, and the average frequency of precipitation associated with dengue risk in 2013–2020 is 1.6 times higher than that in 2005–2012. A total of 3093 attributable dengue cases are identified. From 2005 to 2020, the amount of dispersed precipitation increased in southern and southwestern China and posed high dengue risks in central China. This study has improved the understanding of the health impacts of irregular rainfall under climate change. Our approach to identifying thresholds provides information for early warning systems and helps reduce the risk of dengue transmission in the long run.",

    "abstract": "The short-term temperature fluctuation caused by global climate change is one of the risk factors affecting public health. Exploring the association between temperature fluctuation and diseases, which has received relatively limited research attention, can contribute to enhancing awareness of health risks and taking timely measures for health risk alert and management. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the relationship between temperature change between neighboring days (TCN) and hospitalizations, identify diseases sensitive to extreme TCN, and evaluate the related disease burden. We collected meteorological and hospitalization data from 2014 to 2019 in 23 sites of China to explore the impact of TCN on hospitalizations. We first quantified site-specific associations between TCN and hospitalizations and then conducted meta-analysis to pool the results, to assess the relative risk of extreme TCN for susceptible diseases, and to estimate the related disease burden attributed to TCN. Stratified analyses were undertaken by age, sex, and disease type. Results showed that all-cause hospital admission was significantly linked to TCN. A negative TCN (below −1.9 °C) in the cool season and a positive TCN (above 1.0 °C) in the warm season increased the risk of hospitalization. People aged 15–64 years, men, and patients with musculoskeletal system or connective tissue diseases were more sensitive to extremely negative TCN during the cool season. People aged over 65 years, men, and patients with respiratory diseases were more sensitive to extremely positive TCN during the warm season. The attributable fraction to all-cause hospitalization from negative TCN in the cool season was 2.05% (95% CI: −0.90%, 4.53%) and from positive TCN in the warm season was 5.79% (95% CI: 2.98%, 8.31%). Circulatory diseases in the cool season and respiratory diseases in the warm season had the highest disease burden. Our findings indicate that awareness of TCN and its health risks should be promoted and evidence-informed policies are needed to reduce the risk of TCN.",

It is difficult to monitor SPG in the field due to their complex formation mechanisms and movement characteristics. Traditional single-site field monitoring studies limit the spatial and temporal precision of SPG spatial distribution. To determine the moisture content of shallow soils and the SPG distribution along the QTEC, this work employed the temperature vegetation dryness index and remote sensing models for groundwater table distribution models. The accuracies of the models were validated using measurements obtained from different sites in the corridor. In the permafrost zones of the QTEC, 72%, 22% and 6% of the SPG were located at depths of 0.5‒1, <0.5 and >1 m, respectively. Meanwhile, 79.4% of the area along the Qinghai‒Tibet Highway (QTH) (Xidatan‒Tanggula) section contained SPG. In these sections with SPG, 37.9% have an SPG table at depths of 0.5–0.8 m. This study preliminarily explored the SPG distribution in the QTEC with a 30 m resolution. The findings can help improve the spatial scale of SPG research, provide a basis for the analysis of the hydrothermal mechanisms, and serve as a guide in the assessment of operational risks and road structure designs.",

    "abstract": "Global warming is unequivocal, as is manifested in three internationally known global temperature records with the global average temperature rising at a rate of 0.70–0.75◦C per 100 years during 1910–2009 [Wen et al., 2011]. In other words, the earth has warmed more than 0.8◦C since the Industrial Revolution. If it is true that 2◦C above pre-industrial level is a threshold of climate “safety”, we will have to confront a serious situation where less than 1.2◦C warming is permissible in the future [Liu et al., 2011]. According to climate system concept [Wang, 2011], the global warming is not only reflected in global temperature change but also in changes of other climate system components, such as widespread melting of snow and ice, rising of global average sea level, and permafrost degradation [IPCC, 2007]. Due to its great influences and potential risks on the society, global warming now attains more and more concerns from governments, scientists and public media. Today, global warming becomes one of the most important issues, which must be taken into consideration in strategic decision making of national development. As a scientific issue, however, global warming has been studied for almost 200 years [Mitchell, 2002; Cullen, 2011]. And it now has evolved as an independent discipline closely associated with meteorology, oceanography and environmental sciences. In order to review the development of global warming concisely, in this paper, we shall only focus on the science of global warming itself, excluding impacts, adaptation and policy associated with global warming. In 2011, Archer and Pierrehumbert [2011] compiled the previous studies on the global warming and added their brief comments. This work offered a great foundation for further investigating global warming. In order to understand global warming systematically and comprehensively, we summarize ten essential issues based on the five cornerstone literatures from Archer’s compilation together with four IPCC Assessment Reports and the First World Climate Conference. These ten issues will be reviewed as follows. Greenhouse effect Joseph Fourier was the first scientist argued for the greenhouse effect in 1824 [Archer and Pierrehumbert, 2011]. The earth receives energy from the sun and re-radiates to outer space. Calculations based on the planetary energy balance indicate that the temperature of the earth is much lower than 0◦C as opposed to the observation of 14◦C. This discrepancy is believed to be produced by the atmosphere, which traps more long-wave radiation from earth surface and keeps the earth warmer. A mechanism named greenhouse effect is proposed to describe this process. Greenhouse gases An Irish scientist Tyndall in 1849 verified through his designed experiments that CO2 has greenhouse effect on earth’s climate [Tyndall, 1861]. He was the first to correctly measure the relative infrared absorptive powers of the gases including",

It shows that the amount of KCS is about 353 t C per year in the catchment of Banzhai subterranean stream, and there is good linear relationship between the strength of KCS and discharge of the stream at various time scales. Therefore, how to monitor the discharge accurately is the key to the estimation of KCS.

    "abstract": "Article 3 paragraph 3 and paragraph 4 of the Kyoto Protocol (KP) allow parties to use credits from land-based activities for offsetting their emission reduction/limitation target committed in the KP. Forest management (FM) is the dominant activity accounted by Annex I parties of the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change in the first commitment period of KP (2008–2012). Data reported for 2008 and 2009 indicate that over half of the emission reduction target of 24 Annex I parties that expect to use FM removals can be offset by FM credits in the first commitment period. Especially the majority of the emission reduction target of Slovenia, Sweden, Latvia, Finland, Japan, and Croatia may be achieved through FM credits. The total FM CAP as contained in decision 16/CMP.1 in the first commitment period was over-estimated significantly by 50% for all KP parties and 36% for parties that elected FM. Some parties such as Russia, Japan, Italy, Germany, and Switzerland that elected FM activity may benefit largely from the over-estimated CAP. Presuming a significant increase of the harvest rate, the FM reference level (FMRL) for 2013–2020 is only 1/5 of the historical mean value of FM removals even though most parties show an increasing or a steady trend of net removals from 1990 to 2009. As a result Annex I parties would be able to use FM credits in the future that are over 4 times of FM CAP in the first commitment period. This potential FM credit would account for 7.7% of total emissions by sources without land use, land-use change and forestry activities (LULUCF) in the base year or 1990, and more Annex I parties would share the “benefit” from the FMRL accounting approach.

    "abstract": "Based on the input-output survey of farmers and experts in one of the Jiangsu GEF project areas, the Cost-Benefit analysis method and greenhouse gas estimation method recommended by IPCC were applied to evaluate and compare the social, economic and ecological benefits of artificial transplanting (ATR), mechanical transplanting (MTR) and direct seeding (DSR) rice under wheat-rice Double Late mode (late rice harvest and late wheat sowing). Results showed that the MTR and DSR rice achieved obvious social benefits. Farming measures resulted in excessive emission of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Through the use of ATR rice and wheat rotation mode it is possible to obtain most economic and ecological benefits. The Double Late mode of action had good application prospects, but the key to implementation was the timely exploitation of the recently increased availability of agricultural climate resources. The cropping pattern of combining the wheat-rice Double Late mode with the ATR was a better choice in mitigating and adapting to climate change. Huang, H.-P., S.-M. Ma, E.-D.

In this study, the past dynamics (1960–2020), current situation (2010s) and projected changes (2020–2100) of CWR in China were assessed by calculating the meltwater from glacier, snow cover and the ground ice of permafrost under Representative Concentration Pathways scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5). Combined with projected data of population and economy, the CWR service potential was also estimated in the 2030s, 2050s and 2090s under scenarios of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1, SSP2, and SSP5). The annual CWR in China is about 310.7 × 109 m3 in the 2010s, with glacier runoff, snowmelt, and ground ice meltwater accounting for 24.1%, 72.7% and 3.2%, respectively. Under SSP1-RCP2.6, the quantity of CWR was projected to decline by 14%–18% over the next 80 years, and the service potential would reach the peak in 2100. While under SSP5-RCP8.5, CWR would be reduced by 40% by 2100, and the service would gradually decline from 2050. The study of CWR is of great significance for water security, sustainable development and risk avoidance in the arid endorheic region.",

    "abstract": "Roles of internal climate variabilities regulating global and ocean temperature changes is a hot but complex issue of scientific concern, influencing the comprehensive policy-making in response to global and regional warming. In this study, the time series of monthly global and ocean mean surface temperature (GST and OST, respectively) since 1866 is successfully reconstructed via natural and anthropogenic forcing factors and internal climate variability by using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network technique. The MLP demonstrates prominent monthly GST and OST reconstruction skills on both interannual and annual time scales. Most of the warming in GST and OST since 1866 is found to be attributable to anthropogenic forcing, while the multidecadal and interannual GST and OST variations are considerably dominated by Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). Internal climate variabilities like Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) can amplify the GST and OST changes and explain the global warming slowdown since 1998. Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) performs a similar role as IPO but to a lesser extent. Changes in OST caused by solar forcing are more considerable than those in GST. Moreover, the 'biased warmth' during the Second World War is successfully reconstructed in MLP. AMO and IPO can explain most annual and even sub-annual temperature variations during this period, offering an explanation for the existence of this abnormal warm period other than that it was entirely caused by instrumental errors. The generally high accuracy of reconstructions on interannual and annual time scales can enhance the ability to monitor the prompt feedback of specific external radiative forcings and internal variabilities to changes in climate.",

    "abstract": "A proper assessment of annual climatic status (ACS) is conducive to rationally formulating disaster prevention and mitigation measures. The former definition of ACS lacks either information on extreme climate or an intuitive grade feature service to the public. The ACS defined in the National Standard of the People's Republic of China (GBACS) only considers the accumulated climate effects of each weighted 10-d temperature/precipitation anomaly in a year. Under global warming, the losses caused by extreme climate events often have a significant impact on the grades of ACS, but this impact cannot be reasonably reflected by GBACS. This study proposed the assessment of ACS using extreme climate indices (extreme climate-based ACS (ECACS)) and compared it with GBACS. The results indicated that GBACS and ECACS can be used to evaluate the ACS from different angles. The ECACS is an important supplement to the GBACS, especially considering the years with frequently occurring extreme climate events. The sum of GBACS and ECACS is a reasonable and comprehensive way to evaluate the ACS. The empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis indicated a uniform mode (EOF1) and a dipole mode (EOF2) in GBACS and ECACS in China. The interannual variation characteristics of ECACS in northern and southern China (EOF2 pattern) are consistent with real climate features, which is conducive to providing better and more detailed regional information in the ACS forecast service. The results have essential instructive and application value for ACS assessment and government decision making.",

    "abstract": "A comparison of sea level pressure (SLP) trends in a subset of seven Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) phase 5 general circulation models (GCM), namely decadal simulations with CCSM4, CanCM4, MPI-ESM-LR, FGOALS-g2, MIROC4h, MIROC5, and MRI-CGCM3, to their CMIP3 counterparts reveals an unrealistically strong forecast skill in CMIP3 models for trend predictions for 2001–2011 when using the 1979–2000 period to train the forecast. Boreal-winter SLP trends over five high-, mid-, and low-latitude zones were calculated over the 1979–2000 initialization period for each ensemble member and then ranked based on their performance relative to HadSLP2 observations. The same method is used to rank the ensemble members during the 2001–2011 period. In CMIP3, 17 out of 38 ensemble members retain their rank in the 2001–2011 hindcast period and 3 retain the neighboring rank. However, numbers are much lower in more recent CMIP5 decadal predictions over the similar 2001–2010 period when using the 1981–2000 period as initialization with the same number of ensembles. Different periods were used for CMIP3 and CMIP5 because although the 1979–2000 initialization is widely used for CMIP3, CMIP5 decadal predictions are only available for 30-year periods. The conclusion to consider the forecast skill in CMIP3 predictions during 2001–2011 as unrealistic is corroborated by comparisons to earlier periods from the 1960s to the 1980s in both CMIP3 and CMIP5 simulations. Thus, although the 2001–2011 CMIP3 predictions show statistically significant forecast skill, this skill should be treated as a spurious result that is unlikely to be reproduced by newer more accurate GCMs.",

    "abstract": "Using the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model, sensitivity experiments are performed to identify the climate response to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation forcing. In the experiment, total solar irradiance (TSI) and solar spectral irradiation (SSI) are adopted as solar input from the dataset (1610–2009) reconstructed by Lean. Results show that UV variability has a strong impact on the middle atmosphere. Ozone (O3) distribution in the atmosphere is sensitive to UV irradiation variability. When UV irradiation is enhanced, the O3 content increases at altitudes from 30 km to 60 km and decreases at altitudes from 15 km to 30 km. The atmospheric temperature appears positive anomaly below the mesosphere. Anomalous warmth develops above 35 km with maximum warming anomaly apparent at the stratopause, consistent with the atmospheric distribution of O3, which indicates that the ozone heating mechanism plays an important role in warming. The O3 and temperature respond in an opposite manner when the UV irradiation is reduced. Furthermore, the stronger UV forcing leads to a change in the temperature distribution because of the O3 heating mechanism. This condition then modulates the zonal wind in the stratosphere and upper troposphere. Although the tropospheric response is weak on a global scale, a notable local response occurs over mid–high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) during winter. Along with the enhanced zonal wind in the lower stratosphere near the North Pole, the positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation pattern appears over the NH, which causes a temperature increase over mid-latitude Asia. Finally, the behavior evident in the reanalysis data is compared with the results of the numerical experiments. The similar structure of the response fields means the results of simulation experiment is credible to some extent.",

Focusing on BC emission reduction, this paper gives a brief introduction to the sources and global distribution of BC. Along with the decrease of BC emissions from such actions as the reduction of global greenhouse gases (GHGs) and regulating local air quality, it also highlights other BC reduction approaches such as control and improvement of combustion conditions, the elimination of open biomass burning, and the sequestration of BC by biomass pyrolysis. Finally, it is stressed that at this moment there is no enough reason to push BC reduction into any climate change related negotiations, although BC has been included in some of so-called win-win reduction targets for the quick response to both climate and non-climate appeals.

    "abstract": "Tree-ring based temperature reconstructions have successfully inferred the past inter-annual to millennium scales summer temperature variability. A clear relationship between annual and summer temperatures can provide insights into the variability of past annual mean temperature from the reconstructed summer temperature. However, how similar are summer and annual temperatures is to a large extent still unknown. This study aims at investigating the relationship between annual and summer temperatures at different timescales in central Sweden during the last millennium. The temperature variability in central Sweden can represent large parts of Scandinavia which has been a key region for dendroclimatological research. The observed annual and summer temperatures during 1901–2005 were firstly decomposed into different frequency bands using ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method, and then the scale-dependent relationship was quantified using Pearson correlation coefficients. The relationship between the observed annual and summer temperatures determined by the instrumental data was subsequently used to evaluate 7 climate models. The model with the best performance was used to infer the relationship for the last millennium. The results show that the relationship between the observed annual and summer temperatures becomes stronger as the timescale increases, except for the 4–16 years timescales at which it does not show any relationship. The summer temperature variability at short timescales (2–4 years) shows much higher variance than the annual variability, while the annual temperature variability at long timescales (>32 years) has a much higher variance than the summer one. During the last millennium, the simulated summer temperature also shows higher variance at the short timescales (2–4 years) and lower variance at the long timescales (>1024 years) than those of the annual temperature. The relationship between the two temperatures is generally close at the long timescales, and weak at the short timescales. Overall the summer temperature variability cannot well reflect the annual mean temperature variability for the study region during both the 20th century and the last millennium. Furthermore, all the climate models examined overestimate the annual mean temperature variance at the 2–4 years timescales, which indicates that the overestimate could be one of reasons why the volcanic eruption induced cooling is larger in climate models than in proxy data.",

    "abstract": "The Intraseasonal Oscillation (ISO) is the cornerstone for 2–8-week subseasonal prediction. Understanding the decadal variation of the ISO is important for improving subseasonal prediction; however, there is still a gap in our knowledge of ISO dynamics. Here, we presented a method, an Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis of 11-year-sliding ISO evolution, to objectively detect decadal variation of the ISO originated from the equatorial Indian Ocean (EIO) during 1979–2016. The results show that the properties of ISO have a notable decadal change since 1998 for both boreal summer and boreal winter seasons, mainly in its evolution rather than in its intensity at origin. During the pre-1998 epoch, the boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation (BSISO), was confined to the Indian Ocean; since 1998, however, it propagated northeastward across the Maritime Continent (MC) and the intraseasonal variability over the western North Pacific was significant enhanced. On the other hand, the boreal-winter ISO, usually known as Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) shows minor changes in MC 'barrier effect' between the two epochs, and continuously propagates eastward across the MC. The MJO only shows suppressed activity over the central equatorial Pacific in the post-1998 epoch. These decadal changes are related to the eastern Pacific cooling during the 'global warming hiatus' period rather than to the four-decade global warming. Results here provide a set of potential precursors for foreseeing ISO propagation under different mean states.",

By using the structural dynamics method, this study quantified the changes in the food supply capacity (FSC) of alpine grassland ecosystem and sensitivity to significant variables. The findings indicated that: i) Natural factors were the dominated forces affecting FSC, and their contribution was 71.3%. Of these natural elements, the net primary productivity (NPP) and precipitation were the largest contributors, accounting for approximately 35%. The sensitivity index of the FSC to NPP and precipitation during grassland growing season were 4.1 and 1.9 respectively. On the contrary, human factors like warm shed area, density of road, capacity for access to information, contributed to 28.7% of the total FSC. ii) More intense snow disaster had a larger negative impact on FSC. Snow disaster can cause dramatic reduction in FSC, with a loss rate of 27.6% and with none intense disaster more negative impacts. iii) The continuing increase of FSC in the past 30 years from 1984 to 2014 was due to the significant increase of precipitation and NPP in the growing season of alpine grassland. Evidently, successful adaptation to climate change was critical to combat the climatic adversely impact on FSC. Typically, strengthening information dissemination, road accessibility and knowledge popularization of local residents' disaster reduction should be place high priority for improving FSC.",

High-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) provide a reliable method to explore the vertical characteristics of glacier surface elevation changes in different types. Using topographic maps from 1969 and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data acquired in 2000, we calculated the surface elevation changes for 18 glaciers to generate vertical profiles of elevation difference (VPED) in the Dongkemadi region, central Tibetan Plateau. The results showed that the VPEDs vary highly among different glacier types. For valley glaciers, surface thinning at middle elevations is less than that at higher and lower elevations; for cirque glaciers, however, the maximum surface decline occurred in the middle section; whereas hanging glaciers experienced progressively less surface lowering with increasing elevation. Glacier geometry directly affects ice dynamics, which in turn dictates the VPEDs of specific glaciers. This regulation of glacier evolution can be applied to project how valley glaciers might eventually assume the VPEDs of cirque and hanging glaciers due to ongoing warming.",

    "abstract": "Based on the results of the complex climate model BCC-CSM, the Beijing Climate Center Simple Earth System Model (BCC-SESM) was developed for climate system simulations in Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs). The first version of the BCC-SESM model was based on a high-emissions scenario (ESMRCP8.5) and tends to overestimate the temperatures in low and medium emissions scenarios. To address this problem, this study uses three CO2-concentration-driven simulations under different RCP scenarios of complex climate models to evaluate parameters sensitivity and their impacts on projection efficacy. The results show that the new version of the BCC-SESM (denoted as BCC-SESM1.1) model based on a medium-emissions scenario experiment (RCP4.5) is more suitable for temperature projections for various climate scenarios. It can well reproduce the original value of complex climate model. At the same time, it also has high predictive efficacies for medium (RCP4.5) and low (RCP2.6) emissions scenarios, although it tends to underestimate for high emissions scenario (RCP8.5). The sensitivity tests for different RCP scenarios shows that the BCC-SESM1.1 has higher efficacy in projections of future climate change than those model versions based on the other scenarios. The projection deviations for the global average temperature by the BCC-SESM1.1 (<2%) are better than the previous BCC-SESM (<5%). In light of recent progress in climate policy, the BCC-SESM1.1 is hence more suitable for coupling with IAMs for the purposes of assessing climate outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Wild-caught seafood is an important commodity traded globally. As climate change and socioeconomic development is affecting global marine capture fisheries, the impact on regional supply remains unexplored, especially for areas like Hong Kong relying on global trading to meet high seafood consumption. However, it is challenging to assess the global marine capture fisheries production using complex process-based models. In this study, a data-driven integrated assessment approach was developed to evaluate the change of global seafood supply from wild catch. With the catch data available from 1990 to 2014, machine learning models were trained and tested including environmental, socioeconomic, geographic, and technological features to estimate the catch by ocean grid cells for individual species. Nine popular seafood categories in Hong Kong were studied, which include 68 species in total. Important input features for estimating the catch were compared across species and the impacts of these input features were interpreted using partial dependence plots. The global marine wild catch of the 68 species by countries and the export to Hong Kong were projected by 2030 in RCP2.6-SSP1, RCP4.5-SSP2, RCP7.0-SSP3, and RCP8.5-SSP5. Performances of machine learning models demonstrate the reliability of data-driven methods to estimate the catch by ocean grid cells. The importance of geographic features rank top for the estimate while that of climate change and socioeconomic development varies significantly across species. The projection reflects a drop of squid exported to Hong Kong due to the reduction of squid supply from China's mainland during 2015–2019. The export of wild-caught seafood of the nine categories to Hong Kong will have a slight decline by about 16% from the 2020 level by 2030. The projection also suggests no significant differences among the four climatic-socioeconomically interrelated scenarios regarding the export to Hong Kong before 2030. Top producers include China's mainland, United States, and Japan. However, China's mainland and Japan will suffer from the decline. The data-driven integrated assessment approach can be improved to provide more insights into the long-term change and sustainable management.",

    "abstract": "Sea ice cover plays an important role in modulating local temperature through heat and moisture fluxes. The influence of thin ice, lead and polynya has been well investigated, however, the effect of perennial ice (also called multiyear ice, MYI) has not. This study is motivated by it and investigated a hypothesis that changes in MYI concentration in winter triggers changes in short-term local 2-m air temperature. The hypothesis was tested using time series analysis of the two parameters and correlation between them. Data from the winters of 2004–2009 were used for the examination at three spatial scales. The hypothesis is found to be potentially accepted when MYI exists in a consolidated ice regime with negligible thin ice or open water in the surroundings, and the air temperature is low enough. Conditions for the acceptance of the hypothesis were quantitatively identified. The qualifications entail that the ice cell must experience daily change of MYI concentration meanwhile satisfy the criteria of total ice concentration (TIC), young ice concentration (YIC) and air temperature (Tair) in the surrounding area, which are TIC >88.3%, YIC <9.5% and Tair<–19.0 °C. Inverse relationships between changes in MYI concentration and the corresponding changes in air temperature were developed retroactively using data that satisfied the acceptance conditions. The relationships varied with years, depending on ice conditions such as ice type distributions and snow cover. This study offers a first attempt to assess the effect of MYI on the same-day local surface air temperature using satellite observations, and provides evidence of this effect under quantitatively quanlifying conditions.",

    "abstract": "In the summer of 2021, southern Xinjiang, China, experienced a temporary period of high temperature extremes. Because of this weather event, jujube futures prices rose by more than 50% in a short time. To clarify the influence mechanism of these two events, we investigated the current status of jujube farming and collected investors' online comments. We analysed these comments specifically using textual analysis tools, such as co-word networks. Results showed that the concerns of investors about the reduction in jujube production triggered by high temperature extremes were the primary reason for the rapid rise in jujube futures prices. Especially in combination with the cultivation density of jujube and their adaptability to the growing environment, a new understanding can be obtained. That is to say, when a crop is excessively densely cultivated in a region and is highly sensitive to a meteorological variable anomaly at a certain growth stage, a less destructive local extreme weather event could induce severe panic among investors regarding production reduction and thus influence the normal changes in futures price. In response to the impact mechanisms revealed in this study, we proposed policy recommendations, such as strengthening the degree of crop damage disclosure and designing weather futures derivatives, to address similar situations in the future. This study not only fills the gap in the research on the impact paths of high temperature extremes on jujube futures prices but also has a reference value for securing the stability of futures prices of related agricultural products in the future.",

    "abstract": "The diversity of surface-flux perturbations, especially for heat-flux perturbations, notably leads to uncertainties surrounding the responses of ocean climate under global warming scenarios projected by climate/Earth system models. However, when imposing heat-flux perturbations on the models, strong feedback persists between the atmosphere and the ocean, resulting in nearly doubled heat-flux perturbation over the North Atlantic (NA). Herein, quantitative evaluation of the influences of magnitude change of heat-flux perturbations over the NA on the changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), ocean heat uptake (OHU) and dynamic sea level (DSL) has been conducted by analysis of eight coupled model responses to the heat-flux perturbation experiments in the Flux-Anomaly-Forced Model Inter-comparison Project. It has been demonstrated that the magnitude of the AMOC change is extremely sensitive to the magnitude change of imposed NA heat-flux perturbation, and the weakening amplitude of the AMOC is nearly halved as the imposed heat-flux perturbation F is halved over the NA. The most remarkable responses of both DSL and OHU to the magnitude changes of NA heat-flux perturbation have been primarily found in the Atlantic and Arctic basins, especially for the NA region. Both the added ocean heat uptake (OHUa) and redistributed ocean heat uptake (OHUr) play key roles in OHU changes among the various NA heat-flux perturbation experiments. The magnitude change of NA-mean OHUa is almost linearly related to the imposed NA heat-flux perturbation, while the magnitude change of NA-mean OHUr, which is primarily caused by AMOC change and redistributed heat flux, is not proportional to the imposed NA heat-flux perturbation. There is a nearly linear relationship between the magnitude of AMOC change and the OHUr in tropical regions, including the regions in the low-latitude South Atlantic, the tropical Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean.",

This study proposed a new multi-indicator evaluation framework for regional water sustainability under local energy transition to quantitatively evaluate the water withdrawal and water environment during the energy transition from a lifecycle perspective. An integrated regional energy‒water evaluation model was also developed based on the Low Emissions Analysis Platform with a combination of lifecycle assessment and water footprint analysis. Shaanxi province in China was then taken as a case study, and the impacts of its energy transition on regional water environmental sustainability, including quantity and quality, were investigated under five scenarios. Results showed that the large-scale application of carbon capture, utilisation and storage technology and bio-energy equipped with carbon capture and storage technology could have additional advantages regarding CO2 emissions. However, such technologies exhibit a minimal effect on improving water environmental quality and reducing water demand for the first time due to the leakage of absorbents, CO2 and other risky substances during capture, transportation and storage from a lifecycle perspective. This finding drives the innovation of related breakthrough technologies with the promotion of water and end-treatment technologies in the future.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the factors that may impact intervention effectiveness of primary students is crucial for developing targeted intervention strategies on heatwave adaption. The purpose of the study was to assess how the family factors could affect the intervention effects of primary school students to adapt heatwave, using the data from a previously conducted primary school-based intervention study. The study recruited 648 students (9‒13 years old) and their parents from two primary schools in Dongtai of Jiangsu province, China. From May to September 2017, a 5-mon intervention for enhancing knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) was implemented at the intervention school. The students' KAP scores and the family-related information were measured by designed self-administered questionnaires at intervention school and control school separately before and after intervention. The effects of the intervention were explored through the propensity score matching and difference-in-difference method (PSM-DID), and stratified analysis were conducted by family factors. The overall KAP score increased by 2.391 (95% CI: 1.881, 2.902) after intervention, which shows that the intervention was effective. The students whose parents with higher school educational attainment, parents with employment, and household number ≤ 3 achieved significantly higher increment of KAP scores than their counterparts. Although students whose parents in marriage achieved higher score increasing than parents not in marriage, the difference was non-significant. Our findings indicated that parental education status, working status and the household size were the influence factors of heatwave adaption interventions for primary school students. Future interventions should take parental education status, working status and household size into account to improve the effectiveness of heatwave adaption intervention for primary school students.",

Historical documentary records of climate are suitable for calibration on dating and the climatic implication of the proxy data in a climatological sense. A test calibration on correcting the Delingha tree ring precipitation series using Chinese historical documentary records shows that among the 44 extreme dry cases in 1401–1950 AD, 42 cases (or 95.5%) are believable. Thus the long series of Delingha rings-denoted precipitation is highly reliable. Another test to validate the monsoon intensity proxy data based on the Zhanjiang Huguangyan sediments using historical records indicates that the years of Lake Maar Ti content series-designated winter monsoon intensities are entirely opposite to historical documents-depicted years of harsh winters in 800–900 AD. As a result, serious doubt is raised about the climatic implication of this paleo-monsoon proxy series.

    "abstract": "The Pacific Walker circulation (PWC) was weak in the20th century, but its strength increased in an interdecadal scale in the late 1990s. Previous studies have suggested that it could be caused by the warming of the tropical Atlantic Ocean, or induced by the warming of the tropical Indian Ocean. The tropical Atlantic Ocean would not only directly affect the PWC through the equatorial east Pacific to the west, but also produce an indirect effect to the east through the equatorial west Indian Ocean. Using a coupled general circulation model, we designed a series of tropical Atlantic Heating and Heating_Shut experiments with different heating rates, to detect the mechanism of the impact of tropical Atlantic warming on the PWC. Results show that the tropical Atlantic heating weakens the Atlantic Walker circulation but strengthens the PWC. Diagnostics of multiple physical variables with coherent lower–upper troposphere structure show the responses of the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic heating play a critical role in the strengthening of the PWC. The Atlantic–linked atmosphere over the tropical Indian Ocean exerts a significantly positive heat flux onto the ocean there, greatly warming the tropical Indian Ocean, especially on the west part. This produces strong convectively ascending at the equatorial West Indian Ocean, but descending at the East-central Indian Ocean, corresponding to a ‘Walker’ circulation and an ‘anti–Walker’ circulation situated at the West and East equatorial Indian Ocean respectively. Meanwhile, the convergence (divergence) of the lower (upper) troposphere over the Indo‒Pacific region is also strengthened. In this way, the tropical Atlantic heating is linked to the PWC through the circulation over the equatorial Indian Ocean. This study serves as a preliminary step to understand the impact of tropical Atlantic warming on the PWC, more Atlantic heating sensitivity studies with multi-model experiments are required to further reveal the linkage of the Pacific and Atlantic.",

    "abstract": "Based on the coal demand under the 1.5 °C scenario, the amount of coal production in China was estimated in this study. According to the mutual relationship between the factors influencing coal production, an econometric model was constructed based on simultaneous equations, and the synergistic effect of each factor on the coal industry was estimated under the 1.5 °C scenario. Then, predictions were respectively made in the five aspects: coal production, coal science and technology progress, employment number, safe production level, and occupational health level, in different scenarios from 2016 to 2050. The results showed that before 2040, the comprehensive negative effect of the 1.5 °C situation is more than or equals to the positive effect. The 1.5 °C scenario has the biggest negative impact on employment, whose solution should be the focus. By 2050, the positive effects of the 1.5 °C scenario exceed the negative effect because of the enhancement in technical level and in the attention given to the whole production. Safety is improved, and health defects decline and the most obvious positive effect is on the ecological environment. The decrease of coal production will reduce the ecological environmental damage and significantly improve the ecological environment. In general, the prediction of 1.5 °C scenario promotes the increase of scientific production capacity and promotes the orderly development of coal. It has strengthened the safety and health protection degree, made the coal industry more efficient and competitive, and avoided or reduced the impact of coal development on the ecological environment and achieved environmental friendliness. However, the 1.5 °C situation also increases the employment pressure of the society, which affects the economic development of the major coal producing areas, but the situation can be overcome through the transformation and upgrading of the region. Finally, the impacts of various factors under the 1.5 °C scenario were evaluated through a unified comparison of the synergistic effect monetization using the cost and payment willingness methods. Based on the research results, suggestions on the regulation of coal production were proposed relating to resettlement of workers, protection of the ecological environment, and improvement of workers' health.",

    "abstract": "Climate warming is causing rapid permafrost degradation, including thaw-induced subsidence, potentially resulting in heightened carbon release. Nevertheless, our understanding of the levels and variations of carbon components in permafrost, particularly during the degradation process, remains limited. The uncertainties arising from this process lead to inaccurate assessments of the climate effects during permafrost degradation. With vast expanses of permafrost in the Tibetan Plateau, there is limited research available on SOC components, particularly in the central Tibetan Plateau. Given remarkable variations in hydrothermal conditions across different areas of the Tibetan Plateau, the existing limited studies make it challenging to assess the overall SOC components in the permafrost across the Tibetan Plateau and simulate their future changes. In this study, we examined the properties of soil organic carbon (SOC) and microbial necromass carbon (MicrobialNC) in a representative permafrost thaw-subsidence area at the southern edge of continuous permafrost in the central Tibetan Plateau. The results indicate that prior to the thaw-subsidence, the permafrost had a SOC content of 72.68 ± 18.53 mg g−1, with MicrobialNC accounting for 49.6%. The thaw-subsidence of permafrost led to a 56.4% reduction in SOC, with MicrobialNC accounting for 70.0% of the lost SOC. MicrobialNC constitutes the primary component of permafrost SOC, and it is the main component that is lost during thaw-subsidence formation. Changes in MicrobialNC are primarily correlated with factors pH, plant input, and microbial properties. The present study holds crucial implications for both the ecological and biogeochemical processes associated with carbon release from permafrost, and it furnishes essential data necessary for modeling the global response of permafrost to climate warming. Based on this study and previous research, permafrost thawing in the Tibetan Plateau causes substantial loss of SOC. However, there's remarkable heterogeneity in SOC component changes across different regions, warranting further in-depth investigation.",

    "abstract": "With the focus of highway development transitioning from construction to maintenance, a comprehensive understanding of the characteristics and influencing factors of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from highway maintenance activities is crucial for formulating effective strategies to promote the low-carbon development of road infrastructure. However, the quantitative relationships between CO2 emissions from highway maintenance schemes and factors such as pavement deterioration, traffic volume, and road grade remain unclear owing to a lack of comprehensive, multi-category, and real data. Using real maintenance data from 340 arterial highway segments in China, this study conducts the life cycle assessment (LCA) to estimate CO2 emissions from maintenance activities and examines the primary emission sources among various structural layers and materials. Furthermore, multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis is conducted to investigate the impact of traffic volume, road grade, and pavement deterioration on CO2 emissions from maintenance projects, and factors influencing the early-stage degradation of pavement performance. The results demonstrate that average CO2 emissions from heavy rehabilitation projects are 6.97 times higher than those from medium rehabilitation projects. Emissions from heavy rehabilitation projects exhibit a significantly negative linear relationship with the riding quality index (RQI) before maintenance (p < 0.05), and emissions from medium rehabilitation projects show a significant negative linear relationship with the pavement condition index (PCI) before maintenance (p < 0.05). Emissions from heavy and medium rehabilitation projects are significantly positively correlated with heavy vehicle traffic volume before maintenance (p < 0.05). Moreover, the early-stage degradation of PCI after heavy rehabilitation and RQI after medium rehabilitation exhibit significantly negative linear relationships with their respective indicators before maintenance (p < 0.05). The early-stage degradation of RQI after heavy rehabilitation is significantly positively correlated with CO2 emissions from the base course and cushion layers (p < 0.05). The findings emphasize that timely maintenance and reduction of CO2 emissions from asphalt mixing equipment are essential for mitigating emissions from road maintenance. This study offers valuable insights for advancing the low-carbon development of highways in temperate regions.",

    "abstract": "Geological carbon dioxide (CO2) utilization and storage have been widely recognized as one of the important options to deliver greenhouse gas emissions reduction. Reasonable planning is critical to promote CO2 utilization and storage. However, CO2 emissions gas collection exhibits a stochastic probability distribution, and CO2 utilization and storage features fluctuation demands, which have gone beyond current determine planning techniques. To fulfill the current research gap, this study develops an interval-parameter two-stage programming-based CO2 collection, distribution, transportation, utilization, and storage optimization model, integrating interval parameter planning and two-stage planning into a general framework. Therefore, the model can address uncertainties expressed as random probabilistic distributions and discrete intervals, tackle dynamic facilities capacity expansion issues, develop optimal predefined CO2 distribution policy, and generate recourse schemes to address gas shortage or gas surplus issues. The model is examined by a typical hypnotical case study in China. The results revealed that the model could generate a set of first-stage reasonable CO2 distribution and facilities capacity expansion schemes to maximum system benefits and the highest feasibility. Besides, a set of two-stage CO2 outsourcing purchases and facilities capacity expansion in reserve storage regions solutions were also generated to address the gas oversupplies and shortage issues. The modeling approach enriches the current CO2 utilization and storage distribution research content under multiple uncertainties.",

Observation shows that the freshwater content over 2016–2018 far exceeds the level over the plateau period 2008–2012. Modeling the vertical temperature and salinity structure and their changes in the Beaufort Gyre is a way to understand the process related to such step changes. We configured a pan-Arctic sea ice-ocean model with a southern boundary at ∼7°N in the Atlantic Ocean. The numerical simulation with sea surface salinity restoring, a latitude dependent horizontal diffusivity scaled by the squared buoyancy frequency, and a weak vertical diffusivity of 5 × 10−7 m2 s−1 in the Arctic Ocean better reproduces the sea ice extent, the Pacific summer halocline water, and the freshwater variations as observed. The sea surface salinity restoring mitigates the surface desalination in the North Atlantic Ocean, therefore a weaker ocean stratification prevents the excessive warming in the intermediate Arctic Ocean. It is also found that the weak vertical background diffusivity is the major factor in our model to preserve the vertical ocean structure in the Canada Basin and also the step change of freshwater recently. In addition to resolving eddy activities in high resolution models, the success in our low resolution model suggests that tuning the vertical diffusivity serves as another approach to simulate the increasing freshwater content in the recent decade.",

    "abstract": "The impacts of land cover changes on regional climate in Shaan-Gan-Ning (SGN) in western China were simulated with RegCM3. Sensitivity experiments were conducted by replacing crop grids with different new land cover types in the key area of SGN, where the returning cropland to tree/grass project has been carried out since 1999. The modified new land cover types include desert, forest, shrub and grass. They represent degraded, improved, and maintained vegetation cover with natural canopy in the key area. Results from three individual case studies show that the land cover change causes changes in temperature and terrestrial water variables especially within the key area, while changes in precipitation are found for a larger area. The strongest changes appear where the cropland is degraded to bare soil, leading to increasing temperature and decreases in rainfall, evaporation and soil water. Opposite changes occur when cropland changed into forests, especially with strong increases in soil water. When cropland changed to grass and shrub land, the climatic changes are closer to those with forest cover. This shows the importance of improving and maintaining the vegetation in SGN for the ecosystem and regional climate. Shi, X.-L., H.-J. He, and H.-C.

    "abstract": "The regional climate model RegCM3 incorporating the crop model CERES, called the RegCM3_CERES model, was used to study the effects of crop growth and development on regional climate and hydrological processes over seven river basins in China. A 20-year numerical simulation showed that incorporating the crop growth and development processes improved the simulation of precipitation over the Haihe River Basin, Songhuajiang River Basin and Pearl River Basin. When compared with the RegCM3 control run, RegCM3_CERES reduced the negative biases of monthly mean temperature over most of the seven basins in summer, especially the Haihe River Basin and Huaihe River Basin. The simulated maximum monthly evapotranspiration for summer (JJA) was around 100 mm in the basins of the Yangtze, Haihe, Huaihe and Pearl Rivers. The seasonal and annual variations of water balance components (runoff, evapotranspiration and total precipitation) over all seven basins indicate that changes of evapotranspiration agree well with total precipitation. Compared to the RegCM3, RegCM3_CERES simulations indicate reduced local water recycling rate over most of the seven basins due to lower evapotranspiration and greater water flux into these basins and an increased precipitation in the Heihe River Basin and Yellow River Basin, but reduced precipitation in the other five basins. Furthermore, a lower summer leaf area index (1.20 m2 m–2), greater root soil moisture (0.01 m3 m–3), lower latent heat flux (1.34 W m–2), and greater sensible heat flux (2.04 W m–2) are simulated for the Yangtze River Basin.

This paper uses the China Meteorological Administration Unified Atmospheric Chemistry Environment/Dust model (CUACE/Dust), combined the retrieved biocrusts with two biocrusts inhibit schemes (the roughness length scheme and biocrust strength scheme), to numerically study the inhibiting effect on a strong dust storm in March 25∼30, 2018 in Central and East Asia. The inhibiting effect on dust emission is increasing with the coverage of biocrusts. The roughness length scheme can reduce the total dust emission by about 56.7%, while the biocrust strength scheme by 47.94% in average. In downstream sites in China, the roughness length scheme decreases the surface mass concentrations of PM10 by about 36% ∼ 57% and the biocrust strength scheme by about 24% ∼ 41%. When biocrusts are considered, the forecast of stations near the dust source area is much more improved and the forecast of stations far away from source area is less reasonable under the combing impacts of emission, transport and deposition.",

    "abstract": "The southeastern China (SEC) forest is an important terrestrial biospheric carbon sink in the global carbon cycle, with its total net ecosystem exchange (NEE) accounting for about 3.2% of the global forest NEE. The prevailing atmospheric intraseasonal oscillations (ISOs) over East Asia strongly modulate climatic conditions over the SEC during spring and summer, thus leading to significant ISOs in the NEE of the SEC forest. As atmospheric ISOs show strong seasonality, this study examined the distinctive impacts of atmospheric ISOs on the NEE of the SEC forest between spring and summer. During spring, the vertical coupling of 10–30-d atmospheric ISOs in the lower and upper troposphere leads to strong 10‒30-d ISOs of solar radiation and temperature over the SEC. The 10‒30-d ISOs of solar radiation and temperature further result in the 10‒30-d ISOs of gross primary productivity (GPP) and terrestrial ecosystem respiration (TER). With the covariation in GPP and TER, the NEE of the SEC forest exhibits significant 10‒30-d ISOs. In contrast, the intraseasonal variations in climatic conditions over the SEC are associated with the 15‒60-d tropical atmospheric ISO during summer. While the induced 15‒60-d ISO of solar radiation leads to that of GPP, the induced 15‒60-d ISO of temperature is small and less effective; thus, the 15‒60-d ISO of NEE mainly originates from that of GPP.",

    "abstract": "Hanging glaciers hold the absolute dominant number in West China and their changes had important influences on local hydrology, sea-level rise and natural hazards (snow/ice avalanches). However, logistic and operational difficulties have resulted in the lack of in-situ-measured data, leaving us with poor knowledge of the changing behaviors of this type of glacier. Here, we presented the spatiotemporal pattern of seasonal and annual mass changes of a mid-latitude hanging glacier in the Tien Shan based on repeated terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) surveys during the period 2016–2018. The distributed glacier surface elevation changes exhibited highly spatiotemporal variability, and the winter elevation changes showed slight surface lowering at the upper elevations and weak thickening at the glacier terminus, which was contrary to altitudinal elevation changing patterns at the summer and annual scales. Mass balance processes of the hanging glacier mainly occurred during summer and the winter mass balance was nearly balanced (−0.10 ± 0.15 m w.e.). The glacier exhibited more rapid mass loss than adjacent other morphological glacier and the estimated response time of the glacier to climate change was very short (6–9 years), indicating hanging glaciers will experience rapid wastage and disappearance in the future even with climate change mitigation.",
