    "abstract": "Solving elliptic diophantine equationsby estimating linear forms in elliptic logarithms by R. J. Stroeker (Rotterdam) and N. Tzanakis (Iraklion) 1. Introduction.In [Z], Zagier describes several methods for explicitly computing (large) integral points on models of elliptic curves defined over Q.Here we are interested in the computation of all integral points on a given Weierstraß equation for an elliptic curve E/Q, but not merely by reducing the original diophantine equation to an equivalent finite set of Thue equations which are subsequently solved by elementary, algebraic or analytic methods (see [TdW] and [STz]).On the contrary, we adopt a more natural approach, one in which the linear (group) relation between an integral point and the generators of the free component of the Mordell-Weil group is directly transformed into a linear form in elliptic logarithms.This idea is not new; see [Ma, App.IV], [La, Ch.VI, §8], and [S1, Ch.IX, §5].To make it work, that is to say, in order to produce upper bounds for the coefficients in the original linear (group) relation, one needs an effective lower bound for the linear form in elliptic logarithms.First to obtain such lower bounds were D. W. Masser [Ma, App.IV], in the case of elliptic curves with complex multiplication, and G. Wüstholz [Wu]; see also the bibliography in [H].We felt that the recent result of N. Coroll.2.16] should serve our purpose best.Unfortunately, this result, being rather more general than we required, though effective, is not completely explicit.At our request, S. David kindly undertook the highly non-trivial task of making explicit the special case we needed.It is S. David's result [D, Th. 2.1] that is applied here for the first time to provide explicit upper bounds for the coefficients in the linear (group) relation corresponding to a given Weierstraß equation.We shall show by example that these bounds may be reduced to manageable proportions.In the following sections we shall give a detailed description of the method referred to above.In the final section we present two examples, worked out in detail, of elliptic curves taken from the literature.Our choice",

    "abstract": "We study bounds on the classical ∗-discrepancy and on its inverse. Let n∞(d, e) be the inverse of the ∗-discrepancy, i.e., the minimal number of points in dimension d with the ∗-discrepancy at most e. We prove that n∞(d, e) depends linearly on d and at most quadratically on e−1. We present three upper bounds on n∞(d, e), all of them are based on probabilistic arguments and therefore they are non-constructive. The linear in d upper bound directly follows from deep results of the theory of empirical processes but it contains an unknown multiplicative factor. Two other upper bounds are without unknown factors but do not yield the linear (in d) upper bound. One upper bound is based on an average case analysis for the Lp-star discrepancy and our numerical results seem to indicate that it gives the best estimates for specific values of d and e. We also present two lower bounds on n∞(d, e). For lower bounds, we allow arbitrary coefficients in the discrepancy formula. We prove that n∞(d, e) must be of order d log e−1 and, roughly, of order dλe−(1−λ) for any λ ∈ (0, 1).",

A conjecture of Lang and Demjanenko [L3] states that, for a quasiminimal model of E over K, this number is bounded by a constant depending only on the rank of E over K and on K (see also [HSi], [Zi4]). This conjecture was proved by Silverman [Si1] for elliptic curves E with integral modular invariant j over K and by Hindry and Silverman [HSi] for algebraic function fields K. On the other hand, beginning with Baker [B], bounds for the size of the coefficients of integral points on E have been found by various authors (see [L4]). The most recent bound was exhibited by W. Schmidt [Sch, Th. 2]. However, the bounds are rather large and therefore can be used only for soloving some particular equations (see [TdW], [St]) or for treating a special model of elliptic curves, namely Thue curves of degree 3 (see [GSch]).",

Trivially,where c 1 (K, Λ), c 2 (K, Λ) depend only on K, Λ.Our study is inspired by Diophantine Approximation where, beginning with Dirichlet's Theorem, a family of systems of inequalities parametrized by Q > 1 comes into play.Suppose n > 1,",

We compute the expected value of the trace of the n-th power of the Frobenius class for an ensemble of hyperelliptic curves of genus g over a fixed finite field in the limit of large genus, and compare the results to the corresponding averages over the unitary symplectic group USp(2g). We are able to compute the averages for powers n almost up to 4g, finding agreement with the Random Matrix results except for small n and for n=2g. As an application we compute the one-level density of zeros of the zeta function of the curves, including lower-order terms, for test functions whose Fourier transform is supported in (-2,2). The results confirm in part a conjecture of Katz and Sarnak, that to leading order the low-lying zeros for this ensemble have symplectic statistics.",

    "abstract": "Greek mathematician Diophantus of Alexandria noted that the numbers 1 16 , 33 16 , 68 16 and 105 16 have the property that the product of any two of them when increased by 1 is a square of a rational number. Let n be an integer. We say the set of natural numbers {a1, a2, . . . , am} has the property of Diophantus of order n, in brief D(n), if for all i, j = 1, 2, . . . ,m, i 6= j, the following holds: ai · aj + n = bij , where bij is an integer. The first set of four natural numbers with property D(1) was found by French mathematician Pierre de Fermat (1601 1665). That set is {1, 3, 8, 120}. Davenport and Baker [3] show that a fifth integer r cannot be added to that set and maintain the same property unless r = 0. For the rational number r = 777480 8288641 the product of any two different members of that set increased by 1 is the square of a rational number (see [1]). In this paper we consider some problems of existence of sets of four natural numbers with property D(n), for any integer n. We prove that, for all e ∈ Z, there exist infinite numbers of sets of four natural numbers with property D(e2). Indeed, we show how a set {a, b} with property D(e2) can be extended to a set {a, b, c, d} with the same property, if a · b is not a perfect square. That construction is applied to the identities",

We consider the unbounded case, in particular on l, giving formulas (exact and asymptotic) for the maximal behaviour of the norm √∑ n≤N |bn|2.

The construction in low dimensions suggests a general recipe for producing unit generators in infinite towers of ray class fields above arbitrary real quadratic $K$, and we summarise this in a conjecture.

Introduction.The idea of using global function fields for the construction of s-dimensional low-discrepancy sequences was first sketched by Niederreiter [9, Section 5], [10, Section 5], and the details were worked out in an improved form by Niederreiter and Xing [11].In the method of [11] one chooses a suitable global function field which contains s elements satisfying special properties.This global function field can, for instance, be a rational function field, in which case one obtains an earlier construction of low-discrepancy sequences due to Niederreiter [7].If one chooses certain elliptic function fields, then it was shown in [11] that one gets improvements on the construction in [7].Important progress in the construction of low-discrepancy sequences was achieved in the paper [12] of the authors.The key idea of the construction in [12] is to work with global function fields containing many rational places, i.e., places of degree 1.This method yields significantly better results than all previous methods.The only essential condition in this construction is that the global function field contains at least s + 1 rational places.In the present paper we describe a different construction which is also based on global function fields, but which is somewhat more explicit than the construction in [12].This new construction is also more flexible than that in [12], since we can now use not only rational places, but also places of larger degree.Just like the method in [12], the present construction produces low-discrepancy sequences that are in a sense asymptotically optimal.The new construction produces the best results if places of small degree are used.In the case where we work only with rational places, we get the same results as in [12], but by a different method.Some examples in Section 4 demonstrate that in certain cases the new construction yields improvements on the results in [12] if we use also places of degree greater than 1.",

It appears that these contributions play the dominant role in determining the behaviour of N(P ), and we therefore define N (0)(P ) to be the number of points x counted by N(P ), for which there is no rational line in the surface F = 0 which contains x. Of course it is quite possible that the surface F = 0 contains no rational lines, in which case N (0)(P ) = N(P ). Alternatively it may happen that all points lie on rational lines.

    "abstract": "On the height constant for curves of genus two, II by Michael Stoll (Bonn and Düsseldorf) 1. Introduction.When investigating the arithmetic of a curve and its Jacobian over the rationals (or a number field), it is often required to determine the canonical height of a point on the Jacobian.This is in particular necessary when one wants to find explicit generators of the Mordell-Weil group.It has been a routine matter for some time to compute heights on an elliptic curve.The obvious next step was to consider Jacobians of genus two curves.Flynn and Smart [2, 3] have developed the necessary theory, and they also present an algorithm for computing the canonical height.This algorithm avoids factorisation of integers, but it turns out to be impractical in certain cases.Since this observation was the starting point for the present paper, we give a short sketch of the difficulty.Let C be a curve of genus two over Q, and let J denote its Jacobian.We choose a point P ∈ J(Q) and want to compute its canonical height with Flynn and Smart's algorithm.Its first step consists in finding a so-called \"good multiple\" nP of the given point, by computing 2P , 3P , and so on, until we find an n such that p (nP ) = 0 for all finite primes p.Here, p (P ) is defined as follows.Let x = (x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , x 4 ) be projective coordinates for the image of P ∈ J(Q) on the Kummer surface K ⊂ P 3 .Then (with the notation v p (x) = min{v p (x 1 ), . . ., v p (x 4 )})where v p is the additive p-adic valuation (such that v p (p) = 1) and where δ is the duplication map on K as defined in [1]; see Section 2 below.Now take for example the curve given by the affine equation y 2 = 4x 6 + 4x 5 + 3x 4 -3x 3x -6.Let ∞ ± denote the two points at infinity (the sign corresponds to the sign of 2000",

    "abstract": "Let k be a number field and K/k a V4-extension, i.e., a normal extension with Gal(K/k) = V4, where V4 is Klein’s four-group. K/k has three intermediate fields, say k1, k2, and k3. We will use the symbol N i (resp. Ni) to denote the norm of K/ki (resp. ki/k), and by a widespread abuse of notation we will apply N i and Ni not only to numbers, but also to ideals and ideal classes. The unit groups (groups of roots of unity, , groups of fractional ideals, class numbers) in these fields will be denoted by Ek, E1, E2, E3, EK (Wk,W1, . . . , JK , J1, . . . , hk, h1, . . . ) respectively, and the (finite) index q(K) = EK : E1E2E3) is called the unit index of K/k. For k = Q, k1 = Q( √ −1 ) and k2 = Q( √ m ) it was already known to Dirichlet [5] that hK = 12q(K)h2h3. Bachmann [2], Amberg [1] and Herglotz [12] generalized this class number formula gradually to arbitrary extensions K/Q whose Galois groups are elementary abelian 2-groups. A remark of Hasse [11, p. 3] seems to suggest that Varmon [30] proved a class number formula for extensions with Gal(K/k) an elementary abelian p-group; unfortunately, his paper was not accessible to me. Kuroda [18] later gave a formula in case there is no ramification at the infinite primes. Wada [31] stated a formula for 2-extensions of k = Q without any restriction on the ramification (and without proof), and finally Walter [32] used Brauer’s class number relations to deduce the most general Kuroda-type formula. As we shall see below, Walter’s formula for V4-extensions does not always give correct results if K contains the 8th roots of unity. This does not, however, seem to effect the validity of the work of Parry [22, 23] and Castela [4], both of whom made use of Walter’s formula. The proofs mentioned above use analytic methods; for V4-extensions K/Q, however, there exist algebraic proofs given by Hilbert [14] (if √ −1 ∈ K), Kuroda [17] (if √ −1 ∈ K), Halter-Koch [9] (if K is imaginary), and Kubota [15, 16]. For base fields k 6= Q, on the other hand, no non-analytic proofs seem to be known except for very special cases (see e.g. the very recent work of Berger [3]). In this paper we will show how Kubota’s proof can be generalized. The proof consists of two parts; in the first part, where we measure the extent to which Cl(K) is generated by classes coming from the Cl(ki), we will use class field theory in its ideal-theoretic formulation (see Hasse [10] or Garbanati [7]). The second part of the proof is a somewhat lengthy index computation.",

Tunnell gave a conditional solution to the congruent number problem using elliptic curves and modular forms. Using these ideas, we consider Euler’s problem which reduces to a study of the elliptic curve over Q : EQ(M,N) : y 2 = x 3 + (M +N)x 2 +MNx. If EQ(M,N) has positive rank, then there are infinitely many primitive integer solutions to (1); but if EQ(M,N) has rank 0, then there may be a non-trivial solution. Such a solution exists if and only if the torsion group is Z2◊Z8 or Z2◊Z6. We classify all such cases, thereby reducing Euler’s problem to a question of ranks. In some cases, the ranks of quadratic twists of EQ(M,N) are described by the representations of integers by ternary quadratic forms. Consequently, we obtain results regarding Euler’s problem, and the existence of solutions to a pair of Pell’s equations. Moreover, we give a new and elementary method, using the theory of lacunary modular forms, which establishes that there are infinitely many rank 0 quadratic twists of EQ(M,N) by discriminants in arithmetic progressions.",

In this paper we prove the following strengthening of this theorem: aside from four specific extensions E/F, there exists an element α ∈ E such that both α and α −1 are simultaneously primitive and free over F.

For nonconstant f (mod p) we prove |S(χ, f, pm)| ≤ 2d 1 M+1 p m(1− 1 M+1 ) where d is the degree of f and M is the maximum multiplicity of the set of critical points associated with the sum. In particular, |S(χ, f, pm)| ≤ 4dp 1 d+1 ) . The exponent in the latter upper bound is shown to be best possible. This solves the problem of generalizing the classical upper bound of Hua for pure exponential sums to mixed exponential sums. When all of the critical points are of multiplicity one then we obtain an explicit formula for the exponential sum, generalizing the classical formula of Salie for the Kloosterman sum.",

We describe two simple combinatorial algorithms for constructing characteristic Arnoux-Rauzy sequences (one of which is new even in the Sturmian case). Arnoux-Rauzy sequences arising from fixed points of primitive morphisms are characterized by an underlying periodic structure. We show that every Arnoux-Rauzy sequence contains arbitrarily large subwords of the form V^2+e and, in the Sturmian case, arbitrarily large subwords of the form V^3+e. Finally, we prove that an irrational number whose base b-digit expansion is an Arnoux-Rauzy sequence is transcendental.",

These Dedekind cotangent sums generalize and unify various arithmetic sums introduced by Dedekind, Rademacher, Apostol, Carlitz, Zagier, Berndt, Meyer, Sczech, and Dieter. Generalized Dedekind sums appear in various areas such as analytic and algebraic number theory, topology, algebraic and combinatorial geometry, and algorithmic complexity.

Davenport's constant of G is the maximum of the lengths of the minimal zero-sum sequences over G. Its value is well-known for groups of rank two. We investigate the structure of minimal zero-sum sequences of maximal length for groups of rank two. Assuming a well-supported conjecture on this problem for groups of the form Cm Cm, we determine the structure of these se- quences for groups of rank two. Combining our result and partial results on this conjecture, yields unconditional results for certain groups of rank two.",

This easily leads to examples of surfaces over a number field which do not dominate any variety of general type, but which nevertheless do not acquire Zariski-dense K-rational points over any finite extension K of the ground field (question raised by J. Harris).3. We give examples of (connected, smooth, projective) surfaces X over the rationals Q, whose set of rational points X(Q) is dense for the Zariski topology on X, and indeed is topologically dense in one connected com-",

Such a set is called a Diophantine m-tuple. Davenport and Baker [4] showed that if d is a positive integer such that the set {1, 3, 8, d} has the property of Diophantus, then d has to be 120. This implies that the Diophantine quadruple {1, 3, 8, 120} cannot be extended to the Diophantine quintuple with the propertyD(1). Analogous result was proved for the Diophantine quadruple {2, 4, 12, 420} with the property D(1) [17], for the Diophantine quadruple {1, 5, 12, 96} with the propertyD(4) [15] and for the Diophantine quadruples {k−1, k+1, 4k, 16k3−4k} with the property D(1) for almost all positive integers k [9]. Euler proved that every Diophantine pair {x1, x2} with the property D(1) can be extended in infinitely many ways to the Diophantine quadruple with the same property (see [12]). In [6] it was proved that the same conclusion is valid for the pair with the property D(l2) if the additional condition that x1x2 is not a perfect square is fulfilled. Arkin, Hoggatt and Strauss [3] proved that every Diophantine triple with the property D(1) can be extended to the Diophantine quadruple. More precisely, if xixj + 1 = y 2 ij , then we can set x4 = x1 + x2 + x3 + 2x1x2x3+2y12y13y23. For the Diophantine quadruple obtained in this way, they proved the existence of a positive rational number x5 with the property that xix5 + 1 is a square of a rational number for i = 1, 2, 3, 4. Using this construction, in [2, 7, 8, 11] some formulas for Diophantine",

We show that these partitions also capture the structure of ideal class groups of suitable imaginary quadratic fields, which is a new perspective in the study of class groups. We show that if 8n + 5 is square-free, then C4(n) = 1 2 h(−32n − 20) where h(D) is the discriminant D class number. Moreover using the theory of abaci, we obtain an explicit map from the set of 4−cores to binary quadratic forms.

Furthermore, based on a lower bound construction the authors conjectured the value of g(m, k) for fixed k and sufficiently large m.Concerning the upper bound, they established an upper bound for m prime modulo the affirmation of the Erdős-Heilbronn conjecture (EHC).Since then, the EHC has been affirmed [9], [2], moreover, the bound given in [4] was extended for nonprimes in [19].As will later be seen, it is worthwhile to mention that the affirmation of the EHC has resulted in several attempted generalizations and related results [6], [15], [22],[25].Other relevant developments concerning g(m, k) appear in [3], [5], [7], [13], [14], [16], [23].For example, the value g(m, 3) = 2m -2 was determined in [3], and the closely related function g * (m, k), introduced in [5] and further investigated in [4], [14], [16], was determined for all m and k satisfying k > m/2 + 1.",

Introduction.Let d(n) denote the divisor function and let P (n) be an irreducible polynomial of degree g with integer coefficients.In 1952, Erdős [2] showed that there exist constants c 1 and c 2 , which may depend on P , such thatfor x ≥ 2. This result was generalized by Delmer [1] who showed that for any l ∈ N,with s = 2 l -1 and where the c i may depend, in addition, on l.The lower bound in Erdős's result is fairly straightforward but the upper bound is a combination of characteristically ingenious ideas.In 1971, Wolke [6] clarified these ideas and together with several important contributions of his own, showed that any suitable sum of the form n≤x f (a n ) can be similarly bounded.Here f is any non-negative multiplicative function with f (p l ) ≤ c 1 l c 2 , c 1 , c 2 constants, and {a n } is a sequence of natural numbers with a structure amenable to the sieve method.Applying his results to f (n) = d(n) and a n = |P (n)|, he recovered Erdős's result and, indeed, gave several other interesting applications.The very generality of Wolke's results meant that the bounds obtained lacked uniformity with respect to any particular class of sequences {a n }.In 1980, Shiu [5] obtained such a uniformity for the class of arithmetic progressions, i.e. for linear polynomials and refined the Erdős-Wolke method, in this particular case, to include a larger class of multiplicative functions as well as to obtain a short-interval result.He considered the class of non-negative multiplicative functions f which satisfy the weaker conditions f (p l ) ≤ A l 0 , f (n) ≤ A 1 (ε)n ε for any ε > 0 and constants A 0 , A 1 .",

The values T (a, b, c) for a, b, c ∈ N were first investigated by Tornheim [7] in 1950 and later Mordell [5] in 1958. Tornheim [7, Theorem 7] showed that T (a, b, c) can be expressed as a polynomial in {ζ(j) | 2 ≤ j ≤ a+ b+ c} with rational coefficients when a + b + c is odd, and that the same is true for T (2r, 2r, 2r) and T (2r− 1, 2r, 2r+1) [7, Theorem 8], but he did not give the coefficients. Mordell [5, Theorem III] proved that T (2r, 2r, 2r) = krπ 6r for some rational number kr. In 1985 Subbarao and Sitaramachandrarao [6, Theorem 4.1] explicitly determined T (2p, 2q, 2r)+T (2q, 2r, 2p)+T (2r, 2p, 2q) (p, q, r ∈ N). Then, by taking p = q = r, they gave an explicit formula for T (2r, 2r, 2r) (r ∈ N) [6, Remark 3.1]. In 1996 Huard, Williams and Zhang [3, Theorems 1–3] determined T (r, 0, N−r) (r ∈ N, N ∈ 2N+1, 1 ≤ r ≤ N−2), T (p, q,N − p − q) (p, q ∈ N ∪ {0}, N ∈ 2N + 1, 1 ≤ p + q ≤ N − 1, 0 ≤ p, q ≤ N − 2) and T (r, r, r) (r ∈ N).

For most $n$ in these sets, the period is at least $n^{1/2+\\epsilon(n)}$ for any monotone function $\\epsilon(n)$ tending to zero as $n$ tends to infinity.

    "abstract": "The Katz-Sarnak density conjecture states that, in the limit as the conductors tend to infinity, the behavior of normalized zeros near the central point of families of L-functions agree with the N -&gt; oo scaling limits of eigenvalues near 1 of subgroups of U(N). Evidence for this has been found for many families by studying the n-level densities; for suitably restricted test functions the main terms agree with random matrix theory. In particular, all one-parameter families of elliptic curves with rank r over Q(T) and the same distribution of signs of functional equations have the same limiting behavior. We break this universality and find family dependent lower order correction terms in many cases; these lower order terms have applications ranging from excess rank to modeling the behavior of zeros near the central point, and depend on the arithmetic of the family. We derive an alternate form of the explicit formula for GL(2) L-functions which simplifies comparisons, replacing sums over powers of Satake parameters by sums of the moments of the Fourier coefficients lambda_f(p). Our formula highlights the differences that we expect to exist from families whose Fourier coefficients obey different laws (for example, we expect Sato-Tate to hold only for non-CM families of elliptic curves). Further, by the work of Rosen and Silverman we expect lower order biases to the Fourier coefficients in families of elliptic curves with rank over Q(T); these biases can be seen in our expansions. We analyze several families of elliptic curves and see different lower order corrections, depending on whether or not the family has complex multiplication, a forced torsion point, or non-zero rank over Q(T).",

Introduction.The theory of the canonical height for abelian varieties is very well understood in the theoretical literature (see for instance [10]).However, the only situation where the understanding is full enough to admit a method to actually compute such objects is the theory of elliptic curves (see [16] and [18]).One of the main reasons for wanting to be able to compute the canonical height is to perform efficiently the infinite descent and hence compute a basis for the Mordell-Weil group of an elliptic curve given representatives for E/mE.To do this one needs to bound the difference between the canonical and the naive heights.A naive way of doing this is explained in [3] and [17], however a much more efficient algorithm has recently been given by Siksek [14].In this paper we shall explain how using a direct analogue of Siksek's method one can perform, for some examples, an infinite descent on Jacobians of curves of genus 2. In other words, we compute explicit generators for their Mordell-Weil groups.To perform such a step we hence require an algorithm to compute the canonical height on such Jacobians and a method to bound the difference between the two height functions.",

Solving Thue equations F(x, y)=m of the special type, using the method of Tzanakis, reduces to solving the system of Pellian equations. The application of Tzanakis method for solving Thue equations has several advantages. We show that some additional advantages appear when one deals with corresponding Thue inequalities. Namely, the theory of continued fractions can be used in order to determine small values of m for which the equation F(x, y)=m has a solution. In particular, we use characterization in terms of continued fractions of alpha of all fractions a/b satisfying the inequality |alpha - a/b| < 2/b^2.",

We mention some applications to problems about multiplicatively independent and dependent numbers in situations occurring in the recent theory of linear forms in logarithms associated with the name of Matveev. We also extend our counting estimates to algebraic vectors. Let K be a number eld of degree d = [K :Q] over the rational eld Q. We use the absolute height function dened for in K by",

In this paper we characterize the Okutsu families [F_1,..., F_r] in terms of certain Newton polygons of higher order, and we derive some applications: closed formulas for certain Okutsu invariants, the discovery of new Okutsu invariants, or the construction of Montes approximations to F(x); these are monic irreducible polynomials sufficiently close to F(x) to share all its Okutsu invariants. This perspective widens the scope of applications of Montes' algorithm, which can be reinterpreted as a tool to compute the Okutsu polynomials and a Montes approximation, for each irreducible factor of a monic separable polynomial f(x) in O[x].",

Introduction.Let X be a variety over a number field F .For simplicity, let us assume in this introduction that the set X(F ) of rational points is not empty.Let S be a finite set of places of F .One says that strong approximation holds for X off S if the diagonal image of the set X(F ) of rational points is dense in the space of S-adèles X(A S F ) (these are the adèles where the places in S have been omitted) equipped with the adelic topology.If this property holds for X, it in particular implies a local-global principle for the existence of integral points on integral models of X over the ring of S-integers of F .For X projective, X(A S F ) = v / ∈S X(F v ), and the adelic topology coincides with the product topology.A projective variety satisfies strong approximation off S if and only if weak approximation for the rational points holds off S.For open varieties, strong approximation has been mainly studied for linear algebraic groups and their homogeneous spaces.A classical case is m-dimensional affine space A m F off any nonempty set S, a special case being the Chinese Remainder Theorem.For a semisimple, almost simple, simply connected linear algebraic group G such that v∈S G(F v ) is not compact, strong approximation off S was established by Eichler, Kneser, Shimura, Platonov, Prasad.Strong approximation does not hold for groups which are not simply connected, but one may define a Brauer-Manin set.In our paper [CTX], we started the investigation of the Brauer-Manin obstruction to strong approximation for homogeneous spaces of linear algebraic groups.For such varieties, this was quickly followed by works of Harari [H], Demarche [D], Borovoi and Demarche [BD] and Wei and Xu [WX].",

    "abstract": "The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers (. . .) is known to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic. (. . .) The dignity of the science itself seems to require that every possible means be explored for the solution of a problem so elegant and so celebrated. Wilson’s Theorem states that if p is prime then (p− 1)! ≡ −1 (mod p). It is easy to see that the converse of Wilson’s Theorem also holds. Thus Wilson’s Theorem can be used to identify the primes. Another congruence identifying the primes is (p+ 1)(2p+ 1)(3p+ 1) . . . ((p− 1)p+ 1) ≡ 0 (mod (p− 1)!). (For a proof see [21].) It is not difficult to show that (2p−1 p−1 ) ≡ 1 (mod p) for all primes p. In 1819 Babbage [5, p. 271] observed that the stronger congruence (2p−1 p−1 ) ≡ 1 (mod p2) holds for all primes p ≥ 3, and Wolstenholme [5, p. 271], in 1862, proved that (2p−1 p−1 ) ≡ 1 (mod p3) for all primes p ≥ 5. The congruence (2n−1 n−1 ) ≡ 1 (mod n3) has no composite solutions n < 109. J. P. Jones ([9, problem B31, p. 47], [23, p. 21] and [12]) has conjectured that there are no composite solutions. Unlike that of Wilson’s Theorem the converse of Wolstenholme’s Theorem is a very difficult problem. A set S of positive integers is a Diophantine set if there exists a polynomial P (n, x1, . . . , xm) with integer coefficients such that n ∈ S if and only if there exist nonnegative integers x1, . . . , xm for which P (n, x1, . . . , xm) = 0. If we define Q(n, x1, . . . , xm) = n(1 − P (n, x1, . . . , xm)), then the set S is identical to the positive range of Q as n, x1, . . . , xm range over the nonnegative integers.

Introduction.Let G be an abelian group, and let A and B be finite subsets of G such that 2 ≤ |A|, |B|.The Cauchy-Davenport Theorem [1, 3] states that |A + B| ≥ min(|G|, |A| + |B| -1) if |G| is a prime.Vosper's Theorem [24] states that |A + B| ≥ min(|G| -1, |A| + |B|) if |G| is a prime and if B is not an arithmetic progression.Mann's Theorem [19] states that |A+B| < min(|G|, |A|+|B|-1) only if there is a finite subgroup H such thatKempermann [14] proposed a recursive procedure which transforms a pair (A, B) such that A+B is non-periodic with |A+B| = |A|+|B|-1 into a pair (A , B ) such that |A +B | = |A |+|B |-1, and |A |+|B | < |A|+|B|.Unfortunately A + B could be periodic.The classical applications of addition theorems include the representation of elements of a finite field as sums of kth powers.A. L. Cauchy proved that every element of Z/pZ is the sum of k kth powers.A nice application of Vosper's Theorem due to S. Chowla, H. B. Mann and E. G. Straus [2] shows that for k = (p -1)/2, every element of Z/pZ is the sum of [k/2] + 1 kth powers.This last result was generalized by A. Tietäväinen [23] to finite fields with odd characteristic as an application of Kempermann's theory.Let Γ = (V, E) be a reflexive relation.Theattaining the above minimum is called a fragment.A fragment with minimal cardinality is called an atom.Some properties of the connectivity and atoms are proved in [6,7,8], for relations with a transitive group.In 1986, we observed that these results generalize known addition theorems including Mann's Theorem.In [9], we obtained a generalization of Vosper's Theorem to abelian groups.As an application, we generalized Chowla-Mann-Straus Theorem to arbitrary finite fields.In [11], we generalized several addition theorems to non-abelian",

In this paper we consider the L2 discrepancy of so-called generalized Hammersley point sets which can be obtained from the classical Hammersley point sets by introducing some permutations on the base b digits. While for the classical Hammersley point set it is not possible to achieve the optimal order of L2 discrepancy with respect to a general lower bound due to Roth this disadvantage can be overcome with the generalized version thereof. For special permutations we obtain an exact formula for the L2 discrepancy from which we obtain two-dimensional finite point sets with the lowest value of L2 discrepancy known so far.

Introduction.Let N (x) denote the number of positive integers n ≤ x for which n 2 + 1 is square-free.It was shown in 1931 by Estermann [4] that N (x) = c 0 x + O(x 2/3 log x) for x ≥ 2, where c 0 = 1 2 p≡1 mod 4(1 -2p -2 ).Estermann's argument is very simple, but despite the passage of 80 years the exponent 2/3 appearing above has never been improved.The aim of the present paper is to establish the following result.Theorem.We havefor any fixed ε > 0.It is easy to construct intervals (x, x + c log x] with a small positive constant c, such that n 2 + 1 has a non-trivial square factor for every n in the interval.This shows that the error term in our theorem is Ω(log x).However we know of no better result of this type, and it is unclear what one should conjecture.With the much simpler problem of the number of square-free integers n ≤ x one has an easy error term O(x 1/2 ), but any reduction in the exponent 1/2 would appear to require a quasi Riemann Hypothesis.Thus it seems unlikely that we could reduce the exponent in our theorem below 1/2 without a radically new idea.",

    "abstract": "Ray class fields of global function fieldswith many rational places by Roland Auer (Groningen) 0. Introduction.Algebraic curves over finite fields with many rational points have been of increasing interest in the last two decades.The question of explicitly determining the maximal number of points on a curve of given genus was initiated and in some special cases solved by Serre [34,35,36] around 1982.Since then there have been attempts to attack the problem by means of algebraic geometry as well as field arithmetic.Constructions by explicit equations have been carried out by van der Geer and van der Vlugt [7,8].The present paper, which makes use of class field theory, has its immediate predecessors in work by Lauter [13,14,15] and Niederreiter and Xing [19,20,21,25,26,38].The numerical results obtained improve several entries of the tables given in [9], [17] and [27].As we are looking from the field theoretic point of view, with an algebraic curve X (smooth, projective, absolutely irreducible) defined over a finite field F q we associate its field K = F q (X) of algebraic functions, a global function field with full constant field F q .Its genus is that of X, and coverings of X correspond to field extensions of K, the degree of the covering being the degree of the extension.A place of K, by which we mean the maximal ideal p in some discrete valuation ring of K, with (residue field) degree d = deg p, corresponds to (a Galois conjugacy class of) d points on X(F q d ), and each point on X having F q d as its minimal field of definition over F q lies in such a conjugacy class.In particular the rational places, i.e. the places of degree 1, of K|F q are in 1-1 correspondence with the F q -rational points on X.The (normalized) discrete valuation associated with a place p of K will be denoted by v p .",

Introduction.Soient k un corps de nombres de degré fini sur Q, F une extension non ramifiée de k et p un nombre premier.L'extension k (1) de k, abélienne maximale et non ramifiée pour tous les idéaux premiers finis et infinis, est dite corps de classes de Hilbert de k.De même l'extension k (1) p de k dont le degré est une puissance de p, abélienne maximale et non ramifiée pour tous les idéaux premiers finis et infinis est dite p-corps de classes de Hilbert de k.La recherche des idéaux de k qui capitulent dans F (deviennent principaux dans F) a été l'objet d'étude d'un grand nombre de mathématiciens.En effet, Kronecker était parmi les premiers à avoir abordé des problèmes de capitulation dans le cas des corps quadratiques imaginaires.Dans le cas où F est égal au corps de classes de Hilbert k (1) de k, D. Hilbert avait conjecturé que toutes les classes de k capitulent dans k (1) (théorème de l'idéal principal).La preuve de ce dernier théorème a été réduite par E. Artin à un problème de la théorie des groupes, et c'est Ph.Furtwängler qui l'avait achevée.Le cas où F/k est une extension cyclique de degré un nombre premier p a été traité par Hilbert.Sa réponse est le sujet du théorème 94 qui affirme qu'il y a au moins une classe non triviale dans k qui capitule dans F. De plus, Hilbert avait trouvé le résultat suivant :Soient σ un générateur du groupe de Galois de F/k, N la norme de F/k, U 0 le groupe des unités de k, U le groupe des unités de F et U * le sous-groupe des unités de U dont la norme, relative à l'extension F/k, est égale à 1. Alors le groupe des classes de k qui capitulent dans F est isomorphe au groupe quotient U * /U 1-σ = H 1 (U), le groupe cohomologique de U de dimension 1.",

In the polynomial case, we prove a strong version of this conjecture. To do this we use a result of Lang's on the finiteness of torsion points on algebraic curves.

    "abstract": "Recently Conrey, Farmer, and Zirnbauer developed the L-functions Ratios conjecture, which gives a recipe that predicts a wealth of statistics, from moments to spacings between adjacent zeros and values of L-functions. The problem with this method is that several of its steps involve ignoring error terms of size comparable to the main term; amazingly, the errors seem to cancel and the resulting prediction is expected to be accurate up to square-root cancellation. We prove the accuracy of the Ratios Conjecture's prediction for the 1-level density of families of cuspidal newforms of constant sign (up to square-root agreement for support in (-1,1), and up to a power savings in (-2,2)), and discuss the arithmetic significance of the lower order terms. This is the most involved test of the Ratios Conjecture's predictions to date, as it is known that the error terms dropped in some of the steps do not cancel, but rather contribute a main term! Specifically, these are the non-diagonal terms in the Petersson formula, which lead to a Bessel-Kloosterman sum which contributes only when the support of the Fourier transform of the test function exceeds (-1, 1).",

Since then, other types of rank differences for statistics associated to partitions have been investigated. In this paper, we prove explicit formulas for M_2-rank differences for overpartitions.

According to a recent result by Marklof, if a is taken to be random in an expanding d-dimensional domain D, then (a1 · · · ad) g(a) has a limit distribution. In the present paper we prove an asymptotic formula for the (algebraic) tail behavior of this limit distribution. We also prove that the corresponding upper bound on the probability of the Frobenius number being large holds uniformly with respect to the expansion factor of the domain D. Finally we prove that for large d, the limit distribution of (a1 · · · ad) g(a) has almost all of its mass concentrated between (d− 1)! and 1.757 · (d − 1)!. The techniques involved in the proofs come from the geometry of numbers, and in particular we use results by Schmidt on the distribution of sublattices of Z , and bounds by Rogers and Schmidt on lattice coverings of space with convex bodies.",

We discuss how one can (try to) determine the set of rational points on such a curve. We apply our approach to the original question in several cases. In particular, we show that Fermat's diophantine quadruple (1,3,8,120) can be extended to a rational diophantine quintuple in only one way, namely by 777480/8288641. We then discuss a method that allows us to find the Mordell-Weil group of an elliptic curve $E$ defined over the rational function field $\\mathbb Q(t)$ when $E$ has full $\\mathbb Q(t)$-rational 2-torsion. This builds on recent results of Dujella, Gusi\\'c and Tadi\\'c. We give several concrete examples to which this method can be applied. One of these results implies that there is only one extension of the diophantine quadruple $\\bigl(t-1,t+1,4t,4t(4t^2-1)\\bigr)$ over $\\mathbb Q(t)$.",

It is understood, that the sum is only over values of x for which g and f and both defined as functions on Z/(p), and g is nonzero (mod p). The sum is trivial if f and g are both constants, so we shall always assume that either f or g is nonconstant. The case m = 1, a classical sum over a finite field, has been thoroughly studied. In this case it follows from the rationality of the L-function associated with the sum and the accompanying Riemann Hypothesis, that under very general conditions S(χ, g, f, p) can be expressed as a sum of a certain number of complex numbers of modulus √ p. If f and g are polynomials of degress d1, d2 then this number is exactly d1 + d2 − 1, provided that p d1 and (ord(χ), d2) = 1, and so we obtain the upper bound",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the present note is to give an explicit application of equidistribution of Hecke points to the problem of small solutions of linear congruences modulo primes. Let p be an odd prime. For a random system of d linear congruences in n variables modulo p, we shall ask how many “small” solutions it has, i.e. solutions in Z of size about pd/n, the natural limiting point. We will show that the answer has a limit distribution as p→∞. Questions of a similar flavour for varieties of higher degree have been studied, i.e. given an affine variety V ⊂ An over Z/pZ of codimension d, it may be regarded as defining a system of polynomial congruences for n integers (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ Zn. One can ask (if very optimistic) whether there always exists an integral solution so that max15i5n |xi| 5 Cpd/n, for some constant C depending only on the invariants of V , e.g. degree. This is easily seen to be false, but it turns out that one may prove weaker assertions of this nature: see, for example, [L]. The present note shows that in the seemingly easy case of linear varieties, the small solutions exhibit interesting statistical properties which are, somewhat surprisingly, related to automorphic forms. The question of small solutions of linear congruences is also closely related to the study of fractional parts of linear forms (cf. Section 7 below), which have been investigated by a number of authors using ergodic theory: see, e.g., Marklof [M1]. In our context, we shall use automorphic forms and spectral theory in place of ergodic theory; we are therefore able to give explicit error estimates. The application of the spectral theory of automorphic forms to certain Diophantine questions in number theory is not new; see, for instance, Sarnak’s ICM address [Sa2]. Hecke equidistribution in particular has been studied in great generality by Clozel, Oh and Ullmo in [COU]. Our problem involves passing from smooth to sharp cutoff test functions in the equidistribution results; for this we give a simple way of optimizing the harmonic",

The most striking result in this paper is as follows: If $n$ is a positive integer, $r+s+t=n$ and $x+y+z=1$, then we have $$rF(s,t;x,y)+sF(t,r;y,z)+tF(r,s;z,x)=0$$ where $$F(s,t;x,y):=\\sum_{k=0}^n(-1)^k\\binom{s}{k}\\binom{t}{n-k}B_{n-k}(x)B_k(y).$$ This symmetric relation implies the curious identities of Miki and Matiyasevich as well as some new identities for Bernoulli polynomials such as $$\\sum_{k=0}^n\\binom{n}{k}^2B_k(x)B_{n-k}(x)=2\\sum^n\\Sb k=0 k\\not=n-1\\endSb\\binom{n}{k}\\binom{n+k-1}{k}B_k(x)B_{n-k}.$$",

    "abstract": "A general discrepancy estimate based on p-adic arithmetics by Peter Hellekalek (Salzburg) Dedicated to Harald Niederreiter on the occasion of his 65th birthday 1. Introduction.The inequality of Erdős-Turán-Koksma gives an upper bound for the discrepancy of a finite sequence ω in [0, 1[ s in terms of certain exponential sums; see the monographs Drmota and Tichy [1] and Kuipers and Niederreiter [7] for its general form, and Niederreiter [10] for versions adapted to certain sequences ω of rationals as they appear in applications.These inequalities are an important tool to assess the uniform distribution of low-discrepancy point sets or correlation properties of pseudo-random numbers; see the surveys of Niederreiter [11], Niederreiter and Shparlinski [13] and Hellekalek [4].The classical inequality of Erdős-Turán-Koksma is based on the trigonometric function system.Variants have been established for Walsh and Haar function systems in an arbitrary integer base b ≥ 2 in Hellekalek [2, 3].What is the importance of these variants?Different types of sequences ω require different types of exponential sums to study their equidistribution properties, by means of discrepancy and other figures of merit.Hence, by varying the function system, one is able to \"synchronize\" the exponential sums with the type of sequence under study.In this paper, we will introduce a function system closely related to the dual group of p-adic integers Z p , p a prime, and we will prove a new variant of the inequality of Erdős-Turán-Koksma.This leads to general upper bounds for discrepancy (see Theorem 3.6 and Corollary 3.7).In addition, we will prove a variant of the Weyl criterion for the p-adic function system under consideration (see Theorem 3.8).The uniform distribution of the van der Corput sequence in base p then follows as a simple consequence (see Corollary 3.9).",

    "abstract": "Let n be an integer, and consider finite sequences of elements of the group Z/nZ x Z/nZ. Such a sequence is called zero-sum free, if no subsequence has sum zero. It is known that the maximal length of such a zero-sum free sequence is 2n-2, and Gao and Geroldinger conjectured that every zero-sum free sequence of this length contains an element with multiplicity at least n-2. By recent results of Gao, Geroldinger and Grynkiewicz, it essentially suffices to verify the conjecture for n prime. Now fix a sequence (a_i) of length 2n-2 with maximal multiplicity of elements at most n-3. There are different approeaches to show that (a_i) contains a zero-sum; some work well when (a_i) does contain elements with high multiplicity, others work well when all multiplicities are small. The aim of this article is to initiate a systematic approach to property B via the highest occurring multiplicities. Our main results are the following: denote by m_1 >= m_2 the two maximal multiplicities of (a_i), and suppose that n is sufficiently big and prime. Then (a_i) contains a zero-sum in any of the following cases: when m_2 >= 2/3n, when m_1 > (1-c)n, and when m_2 < cn, for some constant c > 0 not depending on anything.",

We note that the last two papers are independent. In both, the same estimates for exponential sums were used. But Baker and Harman [2] introduced the alternative sieve procedure, developed by Harman [10] and by Baker, Harman and Rivat [3], to get a better exponent. In this paper we shall prove a sharper lower bound. Theorem 1. We have P (x) x 0.738 for suciently large x.",

For m > 1 the converse is also true, by (2) and the functional equation of L(s, χ), but we will not use this. We are going to study some objects related to quadratic characters. Let d be the discriminant of a quadratic field, and denote by χ d = ( d · ) the associated quadratic character (Kronecker symbol). The numbers Bm,χ d /m are always integers unless d = −4 or d = ±p, where p is an odd prime number such that 2m/(p − 1) is an odd integer, in which case they have denominator 2 or p, respectively (cf. [3] or [6]). We also have the case d = 1 for which χ d is the trivial character; in this case, the denominator of Bm/m contains exactly those primes p for which p − 1 divides m. Together, these numbers d are the so-called fundamental discriminants (they can also be described as the set of square-free numbers of the form 4n+ 1 and 4 times square-free numbers not of this form) and the corresponding characters χ d give all primitive quadratic characters.",

Introduction.The family of cubic Thue equations x 3 -(n -1)x 2 y -(n + 2)xy 2 -y 3 = ±1, with n ≥ 0, was studied by E. Thomas.He proved in [T1] that it has only \"trivial solutions\" except for a finite number of values of the parameter n, explicitly for n < 10 8 .Then M. Mignotte [M] solved completely this family of equations and proved that non-trivial solutions occur only for n ≤ 3.Next, other infinite families of Thue equations F (x, y) = ±1 were studied.In the cubic case there are works of Thomas [T2], Mignotte and Tzanakis [MT]; in these cases the family was completely solved except for an explicit finite range for the parameter.In the quartic case, there are works of Pethő [P2], Lettl and Pethő [LeP] and Mignotte, Pethő and Roth [MPR], where the last two studies were completely finished.Here, we come back to the family of cubics investigated by E. Thomas, the case where F n (x, y) = x 3 -(n -1)x 2 y -(n + 2)xy 2 -y 3 , but we add a new parameter: the number k on the right hand side.In other words, we study a family of cubic diophantine equations which depend on two parameters.Our results are explicit bounds for the integer solutions in terms of the two parameters n and k; and we give a special attention to the case x 3 -(n -1)x 2 y -(n + 2)xy 2 -y 3 = ±(2n + 1).This case has some interest since we prove that the diophantine equation F n (x, y) = k has no solution in the range 1 < |k| < 2n + 1 unless k is a cube (the existence of a solution in this case is trivial).We formulate now the three theorems which are the main results of the present paper.",

Introduction.Notre point de départ dans ce travail est une formule explicite particulièrement simple pour le symbole de Hilbert sur un corps local K p qui s'exprime comme suit : Soit l un nombre premier tel que K p contienne les racines 2l-ièmes de l'unité pour un r ≥ 1. Alors pour chaque racine l r -ième de l'unité ζ contenue dans K p et tout x de K × p , le symbole de Hilbert correspondant est donné par la formuleoù v p est une application à valeurs dans un Z l -réseau de Q l définie à partir des logarithmes des valeurs absolues l-adiques.Or l'intérêt de ce résultat n'est pas tant de donner un nouveau moyen de calcul des symboles de Hilbert (nous avons choisi d'en donner ici une preuve directe particulièrement simple, mais nous aurions pu aussi bien l'obtenir en transformant les formules explicites classiques qui font déjà intervenir le logarithme), que de relier naturellement les symboles sauvages à une application v p qui n'est pas définie seulement modulo une congruence, mais prend effectivement ses valeurs dans un Z l -module de rang 1, et peut ainsi être regardée comme l'analogue d'une valuation.Plus précisement, si en chaque place non complexe p d'un corps de nombres K contenant les racines 2l r -ièmes de l'unité, on convient de remplacer la valuation p-adique usuelle v p par celle logarithmique v p , on peut alors définir un groupe logarithmique de classes de diviseurs Cl K , analogue au l-groupe des classes au sens ordinaire Cl K (et donc d'une arithmétique voisine) et lié de surcroît au noyau symboles sauvages dans le groupe universel K 2 (K).L'isomorphisme obtenu",

    "abstract": "In this paper we consider representation of numbers in an irrational basis β > 1. We study the arithmetic operations on β-expansions and provide bounds on the number of fractional digits arising in addition and multiplication, L⊕(β) and L (β), respectively. We determine these bounds for irrational numbers β which are algebraic with at least one conjugate in modulus smaller than 1. In the case of a Pisot number β we derive the relation between β-integers and cut-and-project sequences and then use the properties of cut-and-project sequences to estimate L⊕(β) and L (β). We generalize the results known for quadratic Pisot units to other quadratic Pisot numbers. 1 Beta-expansions Let β be a real number strictly greater than 1. A real number x ≥ 0 can be represented using a sequence (xi)k≥i>−∞, xi ∈ Z, 0 ≤ xi 1. We denote L⊕(β) := min{L ∈ N0 | ∀x, y ∈ Zβ , x+ y ∈ Fin(β) =⇒ fpβ(x+ y) ≤ L} , L (β) := min{L ∈ N0 | ∀x, y ∈ Zβ , xy ∈ Fin(β) =⇒ fpβ(xy) ≤ L} . Minimum of an empty set is defined to be +∞. The aim of this paper is to give some quantitative results for L⊕(β) and L (β). Let us mention some of the known results. Frougny and Solomyak in [4] showed that L⊕(β) is finite if β is a Pisot number. A Pisot number β is an algebraic integer such that β > 1 and all its algebraic conjugates are in modulus smaller than 1. Let us mention that according to the knowledge of authors no example is known of such β that L⊕(β) or L (β) is infinite. Results for special case of quadratic Pisot units are found in [3]. The authors gave exact values for L⊕(β) and L (β), if β > 1 is a root of equation x = mx− 1, m ∈ N, m ≥ 3 or equation x = mx+ 1, m ∈ N. In the first case L⊕(β) = L (β) = 1; in the second case L⊕(β) = L (β) = 2. In this article we provide estimates on L⊕(β), L (β) for those algebraic numbers β > 1 that have at least one of the conjugates in modulus smaller than 1. Other results are valid for Pisot numbers β. The last part of the paper is devoted to quadratic Pisot numbers. We reproduce the results of [3] as a special case. 2 Beta-integers and cut-and-project sequences The Renyi development of unity plays an important role in the description of properties of sets Zβ and Fin(β). For its definition we introduce the transformation Tβ(x) := {βx}, for x ∈ [0, 1]. The Renyi development of unity is defined as d(1, β) := t1t2 . . . ti . . . , where ti := [βT i−1 β (1)] . Parry in [6] has showed that x = xkxk−1 . . . x1x0 • x−1 . . . x−p is a β-expansion if and only if xixi−1 . . . x−p is lexicographically smaller than t1t2 . . . ti . . . for every −p ≤ i ≤ k. Fin(β) and Zβ are centrally symmetric sets. While Fin(β) is dense in R, Zβ has no accummulation points. Distances between consecutive points in Zβ take values {0 • titi+1 . . . | i ∈ N}. It is obvious that if d(1, β) is eventually periodic, then Zβ has a finite number of distances between consecutive points. Numbers β with this property are called beta-numbers. Some results and conjectures on beta-numbers are given in [2, 9]; description of beta-numbers is provided in [8]. Note that every Pisot number β is a beta-number. The set Zβ of β-integers forms a ring only in the case that β is a rational integer, β > 1. If β is an algebraic integer of order q ≥ 2, then Zβ can be naturally embedded into the ring Z[β] defined as Z[β] := {n0 + n1β + · · ·+ nq−1β | ni ∈ Z} .",

Littlewood in his 1968 monograph “Some Problems in Real and Complex Analysis” [9, problem 22] poses the following research problem, which appears to still be open: “If the nm are integral and all different, what is the lower bound on the number of real zeros of PN m=1 cos(nmθ)? Possibly N − 1, or not much less.” Here real zeros are counted in a period. In fact no progress appears to have been made on this in the last half century. In a recent paper [2] we showed that this is false. There exists a cosine polynomial PN m=1 cos(nmθ) with the nj integral and all different so that the number of its real zeros in the period is O(N9/10(logN)1/5) (here the frequencies nm = nm(N) may vary with N). However, there are reasons to believe that a cosine polynomial PN m=1 cos(nmθ) always has many zeros on the period. Denote the number of zeros of a trigonometric polynomial T in the period [−π,π) by N (T ). In this paper we prove the following.",

    "abstract": "in [BGK1] and [BGK2].Theorem 1.1 is an analogue for abelian varieties of a theorem of A. Schinzel [Sch, Theorem 2, p. 398], who proved that for any γ 1 , . . ., γ r ∈ F × and β ∈ F × such that β = r i=1 γ n v,i i mod v for some n v,1 , . . ., n v,r ∈ Z and almost all primes v of O F there are n 1 , . . ., n r ∈ Z such that β = r i=1 γ n i i .The theorem of A. Schinzel was reproved by Ch.Khare [Kh] by means of methods of C. Corralez-Rodrigáñez and R. Schoof [C-RS].A. Schinzel's result concerns the algebraic group G m /F and as shown in [Sch, p. 419] it does not extend to T = G m /F × G m /F and therefore does not extend to algebraic tori and more generally to semiabelian varieties.In Section 5 we observe that our methods of the proof of Theorem 1.1 can be used to reprove Schinzel's result.In 2002 W. Gajda posed a problem which basically asks whether the analogue of the theorem of Schinzel holds for abelian varieties.In the case of Λ cyclic and A an abelian group scheme this problem was independently posed by E. Kowalski [Ko].The problem is also called the detecting linear dependence problem.Our Theorem 1.1 gives the solution to the problem modulo torsion and strengthens the results of [B], [BGK2], [GG] and [We].Namely, T. Weston [We] obtained the result stated in Theorem 1.1 for End F (A) commutative.In [BGK2], together with W. Gajda, we proved Theorem 1.1 for elliptic curves without CM and more generally, for a class of abelian varieties with End F (A) = Z, without torsion ambiguity.Moreover we showed [BGK2, Theorem 2.9] that for any abelian variety, any free End F (A)-module Λ ⊂ A(F ) and any P ∈ A(F ) such that End F (A)P is a free End F (A)-module condition (2) of Theorem 1.1 implies that there is an a ∈ N such that aP ∈ Λ. W. Gajda and K. Górnisiewicz [GG, Theorem 5.1] showed that the coefficient a in [BGK2, Theorem 2.9] may be taken to be equal to 1.A very short proof of [GG, Theorem 5.1] was also given in [B, Prop.2.8].The main result of [B] states that the problem asked by W. Gajda has an affirmative solution for all abelian varieties but under the assumption that End F (A)P is a free End F (A)-module and Λ is a free Z-module which has a Z-basis linearly independent over End F (A). A. Perucca [Pe2], using methods of [B], [GG] and [Kh], has generalized the results of [B] and [GG] to the case of a product of an abelian variety and a torus and removed the assumption in [B] and [GG] that End F (A)P is a free End F (A)-module.Recently P. Jossen [Jo] has given a positive solution to the detecting linear dependence problem for simple abelian varieties.His methods are different from ours.Our research on nonsimple abelian varieties with noncommutative endomorphism algebras led us to the discovery of the upper bound in Theorem 1.1.Consequently, we constructed (see Proposition 5.6) counterexamples to the detecting linear dependence problem.Another counterexample was found independently by P. Jossen and A.",

The Cesaro asymptotic estimate explicitly means that ∫ x 1 N(t)− at t ( 1− t x )m dt = O ( x log x ) , for somem ∈ N. Therefore, it includes Beurling’s classical condition. We also show that under these conditions the Mobius function, associated to the generalized number system, has mean value equal to 0. The methods of this article are based on complex Tauberian theorems for local pseudo-function boundary behavior and arguments from the theory of asymptotic behavior of Schwartz distributions.",

    "abstract": "Zero-density estimate for modular form L-functions in weight aspect by Bob Hough (Stanford, CA)1. Introduction.In the analytic theory of L-functions, it is sometimes possible to circumvent assumption of the Riemann Hypothesis by applying zero density arguments.Briefly, one argues that for a family of L-functions that is sufficiently \"spectrally complete\", the functions in the family have comparatively few zeros to the right of the 1/2-line.Historically, zero density questions were first considered with respect to the Riemann zeta function ζ(1/2 + σ + it) as the parameter t varied, and the first result along these lines could be said to be the Hadamard-de la Vallée-Poussin zero-free region.Later investigations focused on the numberproving that this number decayed in the power of T with increasing σ > 0. A classical result in this direction is due to Ingham [I]:Selberg [S1] made a major contribution to this theory, proving the uniform boundThe crucial feature of this estimate is that the power of log T matches the true order in the number of zeros of ζ up to height T , so that the estimate is still useful even when σ is on the order of 1/log T .This formed one of the key analytic ingredients in Selberg's unconditional proof that the real and imaginary parts of log ζ(1/2 + it) become normally distributed in large intervals t ∈ [T, 2T ].Subsequent to his work on ζ, Selberg [S2] proved an analogous zero density estimate in the family of Dirichlet L-functions to a large modulus q, 2010",

For quadratic extensions L/Q, the matrices in question are constructed from the Legendre symbols of the primes ramified in L/Q and the primes of S.",

A detailed theory was developed in Niederreiter [9] (see also [10, Chapter 4] for surveys of this theory). So-called digital nets and sequences are of special interest due to the following two reasons. First, until now all construction methods for (t,m,s)nets and (t,s)-sequences which are relevant for applications in quasi-Monte Carlo methods are digital methods over certain rings. Second, digital (t,m,s)-nets behave extremely well for the numerical integration of functions which are representable by an in some sense rapidly converging multivariate Walsh series. In a series of papers, Larcher and several co-authors established lattice rules for the numerical integration of multivariate Walsh series by digital nets. We refer to [5] for a concise introduction in the field of Larcher’s lattice rules. 1.1. Definitions and notations. The concepts of (t,m,s)-nets and of (t,s)-sequences in a base b provide point sets of b m points, respectively infinite sequences, in the half-open s-dimensional unit cube I s := [0, 1) s ,",

    "abstract": "Both types are comprised under the name of “linear relations”. One of our objectives consists in convincing the reader that the representation theory of finite groups, applied to the Galois group G = Gal(L/K) of f , is the appropriate framework for questions of this kind. More than 15 years ago we already pointed out this role of representation theory in our paper [11]—it seems, however, that the proper value of this tool has not been recognized by several later researchers (cf. [19], [9], [10], [1], [17]). As an effect, some minor observations of [11] appear as main results in later articles (cf., e.g., [11], Proposition 4, Assertion 3 and [9], Theorem 3). An exception to this tendency is the recent paper [7]. But although it uses representation theory, its viewpoint differs from that of our previous work: The results of [7] are mainly necessary conditions saying that a given relation (such as x1 = x2 + x3) can occur for a certain class of polynomials only. Our paper [11], in contrast, contains a criterion that allows one to decide whether a given relation (1) is possible or not in a specific case (cf. Theorem 1 below). This criterion yields a classification of all possible relations (1) for polynomials f over K = Q of degree n ≤ 15 with G acting primitively on its roots ([11], Theorem 1, and Section 2, ibid.). For example, the relation",

    "abstract": "The Petersson trace formula relates spectral data coming from cusp forms to Kloosterman sums and Bessel functions. It was discovered in 1932 [Pe] long before Selberg’s trace formula and can be regarded as the first type of trace formula for automorphic forms. It has proven to be an indispensable tool for estimating the size of the Fourier coefficients of modular forms in many situations. See for example [Se], [IK], and Section 5 of [Iw]. In this paper we will use the relative trace formula to prove a variant of the Petersson trace formula. The resulting generalized formula relates Hecke eigenvalues, Fourier coefficients and Petersson norms of cusp forms (on the spectral side) to Bessel functions and Kloosterman sums (on the geometric side). To state this result, let Sk(N,ω ′) be the space of cusp forms of level N , weight k > 2, and nebentypus ω′ (see Section 3). For an integer n which is prime to N , let F be an orthogonal basis consisting of eigenfunctions for the Hecke operator Tn. Then (see Theorem 3.9)",

We can then define the Waring function g(k, q) as the maximal number of summands needed to express all elements of Fq as sums of kth powers. We note that, by an easy argument, we have g(k, q) = g(k, q), where k = gcd(k, q − 1). Hence, we will assume from now on that k divides q − 1. Several authors have established bounds on the value of g(k, q) for various choices of the parameters k and q – a survey is given in [8]. For the cases where the exponent k is small compared to q, there are strong results. For example, whenever 2 ≤ k < q + 1, it follows that g(k, q) = 2 by a direct application of the Weil bound for the number of points on varieties over finite fields [6, 7, 8]. In this paper, we will look at the cases where the exponent k is large compared to q, and we will obtain not only a bound, but the exact value of g(k, q) for two infinite families of pairs (k, q). Our main results are the following.",

The s-Frobenius number of this ntuple, Fs(a), is defined to be the largest positive integer that cannot be represented as ∑n i=1 aixi in at least s different ways, where x1, ..., xn are non-negative integers. This natural generalization of the classical Frobenius number, F1(a), has been studied recently by a number of authors. We produce new upper and lower bounds for the s-Frobenius number by relating it to the so called s-covering radius of a certain convex body with respect to a certain lattice; this generalizes a well-known theorem of R. Kannan for the classical Frobenius number. Using these bounds, we obtain results on the average behavior of the s-Frobenius number, extending analogous recent investigations for the classical Frobenius number by a variety of authors. We also derive bounds on the s-covering radius, an interesting geometric quantity in its own right.",

As a result, we show that the same conclusion holds if (ik, jk) are the starting and ending positions of the k'th maximal zero block, and, more generally, of the k'th maximal x- block, where x is an arbitrary word. This enables us to draw conclusions about the irrationality exponent of automatic and morphic numbers.

Inspired by three questions asked by the third author in previous work investigating the fractal geometric properties of the Lagrange and Markov spectra, we investigate the function dloc(t) that gives the local Hausdorff dimension at a point t of L′. Specifically, we construct several intervals (having non-trivial intersection with L′) on which dloc is non-decreasing. We also prove that the respective intersections of M′ and M” with these intervals coincide. Furthermore, we completely characterize the local dimension of both spectra when restricted to those intervals. Finally, we demonstrate the largest known elements of the difference set M∖L and describe two new maximal gaps of M nearby.",

David obtained an explicit lower bound for linear forms in elliptic logarithms (cf.[D95]), the elliptic logarithm method, independently developed in [ST94] and [GPZ94] and based upon David's result, provided a more generally applicable approach for solving elliptic equations.First Weierstraß equations were tackled (see [ST94], [Sm94], [St95], [BST97]), then in [Tz96] Tzanakis considered quartic models and in [SdW97] the authors gave an example of an unusual cubic non-Weierstraß model.In the present paper we shall treat the general case of a cubic diophantine equation in two variables, representing an elliptic curve over Q.We are thus interested in the diophantine equation ( 1) f (u, v) = 0 in rational integers u, v, where f ∈ Q[x, y] is of degree 3.Moreover, we require (1) to represent an elliptic curve E, that is, a curve of genus 1 with at least one rational point (u 0 , v 0 ).",

Introduction.Il existe de nombreuses méthodes pour générer des suites symboliques (i.e.à valeurs sur un ensemble fini).L'une d'elles consiste à découper le cercle unité en un nombre fini d'intervalles en associant une lettre différente à chaque intervalle, puis à considérer, étant donnés un point x et une transformation ∆ du cercle, la suite dont le n ième terme est la lettre associée à l'intervalle auquel appartient le point ∆ n (x).Nous présentons dans ce travail certaines propriétés des suites générées de cette façon dans le cas où la transformation est une rotation du cercle unité.En particulier, nous en donnons une caractérisation combinatoire complète.Une classe particulière de ces suites est déjà bien connue.En effet, lorsqu'on considère un découpage en deux intervalles et que l'un des deux est de longueur égale à l'angle, les suites ainsi obtenues sont \"sturmiennes\".L'étude de ces suites est certainement un des domaines de la dynamique symbolique les plus prolifiques comme en témoigne l'abondante littérature consacrée à ce sujet (voir [5]).L'intérêt qu'elles suscitent encore à ce jour s'explique par diverses raisons.Ce sont d'une part les suites non-ultimement périodiques les plus simples d'un point de vue combinatoire.Mais elles constituent surtout un des liens les plus établis entre arithmétique et combinatoire des mots.En effet, dans les deux articles fondateurs de la dynamique symbolique [9, 10], M. Morse et G. A. Hedlund ont montré que les suites sturmiennes, dont on peut donner des définitions combinatoires simples en terme de fonction de complexité (fonction qui associe à tout entier naturel n le nombre de facteurs de longueur n apparaissant dans la suite) ou d'équilibre, peuvent également s'interpréter en tant que codages de rotations particuliers.L'étude des suites sturmiennes est empreinte de cette dualité et la démonstration de leurs caractéristiques fait souvent appel à des résultats de théorie 1991",

    "abstract": "Drinfeld modules of rank 1 and algebraic curveswith many rational points.II by Harald Niederreiter (Wien) and Chaoping Xing (Hefei)1. Introduction.We continue the presentation of new constructions of algebraic curves over a finite field F q with many F q -rational points by a method based on Drinfeld modules of rank 1 which was initiated in our earlier papers [28], [29].By an algebraic curve over F q we always mean a projective, smooth, absolutely irreducible algebraic curve defined over F q .Let N (C) denote the number of F q -rational points of C. For given g ≥ 0 and q we put N q (g) = max N (C), where the maximum is extended over all algebraic curves C of fixed genus g over F q .An algebraic curve C over F q of genus g is called optimal if N (C) = N q (g).Optimal curves, and more generally algebraic curves C over F q of genus g with many F q -rational points, i.e., with N (C) close to N q (g), have received a lot of attention in the literature.We refer e.g. to the work of Ihara [6] and Serre [15]-[18] in the 1980s and to the more recent papers of Garcia and Stichtenoth [1], [3], Niederreiter and Xing [8]-[10], Perret [11], Schoof [14], van der Geer and van der Vlugt [23], [24], Xing [26], and Xing and Niederreiter [28], [29]. The construction of algebraic curves over F q with many F q -rational points is an interesting problem per se, but it is also important for applications in the theory of algebraic-geometry codes (see [21], [22]) and in the recent constructions of low-discrepancy sequences introduced by the authors [7], [8], [27].It will be convenient to use the correspondence between an algebraic curve C over F q and its function field K, which is a global function field with full constant field F q , i.e., with F q algebraically closed in K.",

Introduction.We study the structure of the 2-Sylow subgroup of the tame kernel of a number field.Although many results exist in this direction, this subgroup is not yet well understood, even for quadratic number fields.Let F be a number field with the ring of integers Rognes and C. Weibel [21] gave the explicit structure of K n O F for some number fields.But it remains a big challenge, even for n = 2 and F a quadratic number field.For a positive integer n, let r., the number of cyclic components of K 2 O F whose order is divisible by 2 n .To understand the 2-Sylow subgroup of K 2 O F , one needs to know r 2 n for all n.We shall develop a method to treat r 4 when F is a quadratic number field.We shall now give a brief indication of the contents.In Section 2, we recall some known results which will be used repeatedly in this paper, state some definitions, and derive some new results which give a method of determining r 4 for a quadratic field F .In Sections 3 and 4, we use the results of the preceding section to study the 2-Sylow subgroups of the tame kernel of real and imaginary quadratic fields, respectively.Let F = Q( √ d), d ∈ Z square-free, be a quadratic field.When d has at most three odd prime divisors, we know r 4 in every case (see [18,19]).Let F = Q( √ d) be a real quadratic field.We use N F for the set of norms from F over Q.Let d ∈ N have prime factorization d = 2 σ l 1 • • • l n , where σ = 0 or 1.",

For |h| ≥ 1 2 the zeros of Ah(s) and Bh(s) all lie on the critical line ℜ(s) = 1 and are simple zeros. The number of zeros of these functions to height T has asymptotically the same density as the Riemann zeta zeros. For fixed |h| ≥ 1 the distribution of normalized zero spacings of these functions up to height T converge as T → ∞ to a limiting distribution, which consists of equal spacings of size 1. That is, these zeros are asymptotically regularly spaced. Assuming the Riemann hypothesis, the same properties hold for all nonzero h. In particular, these averaging and differencing operations destroy the (conjectured) GUE distribution of the zeros of the ξ-function, which should hold at h = 0. Analogous results hold for all completed Dirichlet L-functions ξχ(s) having χ a primitive character.",

The period of this pseudorandom number generator is closely related to \\lambda(\\lambda(n)), where \\lambda(n) denotes Carmichael's function, namely the maximal multiplicative order of any integer modulo n. In this paper, we show that for almost all n, the size of \\lambda(\\lambda(n)) is n/exp((1+o(1))(log log n)^2 log log log n). We conjecture an analogous formula for the k-th iterate of \\lambda. We deduce that for almost all n, the psuedorandom number generator described above has at least exp((1+o(1))(log log n)^2 log log log n) disjoint cycles. In addition, we show that this expression is accurate for almost all n under the assumption of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis for Kummerian fields. We also consider the number of iterations of \\lambda it takes to reduce an integer n to 1, proving that this number is less than (1+o(1))(log log n)/log 2 infinitely often and speculating that log log n is the true order of magnitude almost always.",

    "abstract": "A linear equation on k unknowns is called a (k, h)-equation if it is of the form ∑k i=1 aixi = 0, with ai ∈ {−h, . . . , h} and ∑ ai = 0. For a (k, h)-equation E, let rE(n) denote the size of the largest subset of the first n integers with no solution of E (besides certain trivial solutions). Several special cases of this general problem, such as Sidon’s equation and sets without threeterm arithmetic progressions, are some of the most well studied problems in additive number theory. Ruzsa was the first to address the general problem of the influence of certain properties of equations on rE(n). His results suggest, but do not imply, that for every fixed k, all but an O(1/h) fraction of the (k, h)-equations E are such that rE(n) > n1−o(1). In this paper we address the generalized problem of estimating the size of the largest subset of the first n integers with no solution of a set S of (k, h)-equations (again, besides certain trivial solutions). We denote this quantity by rS(n). Our main result is that all but an O(1/h) fraction of the sets of (k, h)-equations S of size k − b √ 2kc + 1, are such that rS(n) > n1−o(1). We also give several additional results relating properties of sets of equations and rS(n).",

Introduction.In the literature there are various effective results on S-unit equations in two unknowns.In our paper we work out effective results in a quantitative form for the more general equationwhere a 1 , a 2 ∈ Q * and Γ is an arbitrary finitely generated subgroup of positive rank of the multiplicative group (Qordinatewise multiplication (see Theorems 2.1 and 2.2).Such more general results can be used to improve upon existing effective bounds on the solutions of discriminant equations and certain decomposable form equations.These will be worked out in a forthcoming work.In fact, in the present paper we prove even more general effective results for equations of the shape (1.1) with solutions (x 1 , x 2 ) from a larger group, namely the division group Γ2 ) ∈ Γ }, and even with solutions (x 1 , x 2 ) \"very close\" to Γ .To our knowledge, these are the first effective results of this kind.Our results give an effective upper bound for both the height of a solution (x 1 , x 2 ) and the degree of the field Q(x 1 , x 2 ); see Theorems 2.3 and 2.5 and Corollary 2.4.In the proofs of these theorems we utilize Theorem 2.1 (on (1.1) with solutions from Γ ), as well as a result of Beukers and Zagier [2], which asserts that (1.1) has at most two solutions (x 1 , x 2 ) ∈ (Q * ) 2 with very small height.The hard core of the proofs of our results mentioned above is a new effective lower bound for |1 -αξ| v , where α is a fixed element from a given algebraic number field K, v is a place of K, and the unknown ξ is taken from 2000",

Introduction.Les premières familles d'équations de Thue n'ayant que des solutions dites triviales ont été données par E. Thomas en 1990 [13].D'autres familles ont été trouvées par la suite [10].Les familles d'équationsde Thue étudiées jusqu'à présent font presque toutes intervenir des équations variant avec un paramètre dont dépend un corps de nombres attaché à ladite équation.À date, il n'y avait pas encore de familles d'équations de Thue-Mahler pour lesquelles la finitude du nombre de solutions ait été établie.Notre résultat va permettre d'attacher, à chaque corps de nombres algébriques possédant une infinité d'unités, une famille infinie d'équations de Thue-Mahler n'ayant qu'un nombre fini de solutions non triviales.L'outil diophantien que nous allons mettre en oeuvre est le théorème du sous-espace de W. M. Schmidt [5,1,14].Nous poursuivrons ultérieurement ce travail en remplaçant le théorème non effectif du sous-espace par des minorations de formes linéaires de logarithmes, de façon à rendre effectifs nos résultats, au moins dans certains cas particuliers.2.

    "abstract": "Genera of arithmetic Fuchsian groups byStefan Johansson (Göteborg)Introduction.The fundamental invariant of a Riemann surface is its genus.In this paper, using arithmetical means, we calculate the genus of certain Riemann surfaces defined by unit groups in quaternion algebras.First we recall a well-known general construction of Riemann surfaces.The group SL 2 (R) acts on the upper half-plane H by Möbius transformations.If G is a Fuchsian group, that is, a discrete subgroup of SL 2 (R), then it is possible to provide the quotient space G\\H with the structure of a Riemann surface.A distinguished class of Fuchsian groups are the arithmetic ones.These are by definition groups commensurable with unit groups in quaternion orders.The best known example of an arithmetic Fuchsian group is the modular group SL 2 (Z).The genus of the (compactification of the) surfaces corresponding to certain subgroups of SL 2 (Z) is well investigated (see for example the first chapter in [16]).A more general investigation can be found in [4], where the authors, among other things, derive a list of all congruence subgroups of SL 2 (Z) which give Riemann surfaces with genus 0. Another related result is the determination of all arithmetic triangular groups in [17].In this paper, we will consider the case of orders in quaternion division algebras.This case contains all arithmetic Fuchsian groups, except those commensurable with SL 2 (Z).There exists a general formula for the genus in this case.However, the implementation of this was only known explicitly in the simplest case of maximal orders in algebras over Q.The main purpose of the paper is to generalize this to arbitrary orders in rational quaternion algebras and also to maximal orders in algebras over quadratic fields.As an application of these explicit formulas, we give complete lists of all such orders for which the genus is less than or equal to 2.In Section 1, we give the necessary background and some notations.The following two sections contain general formulas for the area of fundamental",

In 1965, Mann [2] showed that if (ζ1, . . . , ζn) is a non-degenerate solution of (1.1), then ζ 1 = · · · = ζ n = 1, where d is a product of distinct primes ≤ n+1. From this result it can be deduced that ν(a1, . . . , an) ≤ e1 2 for some absolute constant c1. Later, Conway and Jones [1] showed that for every non-degenerate solution (ζ1, . . . , ζn) of (1.1) one has ζ 1 = · · · = ζ n = 1, where d is the product of distinct primes p1, . . . , pl with ∑l i=1(pi−2) ≤ n−1. This implies that ν(a1, . . . , an) ≤ e2 3/2(log n)1/2 for some absolute constant c2. Schinzel [3] showed that if a1, . . . , an are non-zero and generate an algebraic number field of degree D, then ν(a1, . . . , an) ≤ c2(n,D) for some function c2 depending only on n and D. Later, Zannier [5] gave a different proof of this fact and computed c2 explicitly. Finally, Schlickewei [4] succeeded to derive an upper bound for the number of non-degenerate solutions of (1.1) depending only on n for arbitrary complex coefficients a1, . . . , an.",

Introduction, notations et résultats.Il y a eu récemment des travaux originaux et intéressants sur les problèmes de dynamique des fractions rationnelles en une variable en analyse ultramétrique, c'est-à-dire quand le corps de base est un corps ultramétrique K. On définit, et on s'intéresse dans ce cadre aux propriétés des ensembles de Fatou et de Julia associées à une fraction rationnelle à coefficients dans K. Parmi les articles de base sur le sujet, on renvoie les lecteurs aux articles de la bibliographie, en particulier aux articles de L. Hsia et R. Benedetto [HS1, HS2, BE1, BE2, BE3, BE4].Pour ce qui concerne la théorie complexe, on pourra consulter le livre récent de J. Milnor [MI] ou le livre de A. F. Beardon [BEA].Nous allons commencer par donner quelques définitions.Soient p un nombre premier rationnel fixé, et C p le complété d'une clôture algébrique du corps Q p des nombres p-adiques.Pour un polynôme H à coefficients dans C p , on note d(H) son degré.Soit R une fraction rationnelle ; on écrit R = P/Q, avec P et Q polynômes premiers entre eux ; on notera alors d(R) la quantité max{d(P ), d(Q)}, qui sera le degré de R.On supposera dans toute la suite que R est de degré au moins 2. La fraction rationnelle R définit une application de P 1 (C p ) dans luimême, que nous visualiserons simplement en rajoutant un point à l'infini à C p .Dans ce cadre, on peut itérer la transformation qui à x ∈ C p ∪ {∞} associe R(x) ; nous noterons R [n] les itérées successives de R.On peut définir une distance sur P 1 (C p ), la distance sphérique, de la façon suivante : pour deux points A = (x, y) et B = (u, v), on pose ∆(A, B) = |vx -uy| max{|x|, |y|} max{|u|, |v|} .",

Introduction.We introduce and investigate a family of functions called nonanalytic \"pseudo-Poincaré series\".These functions are inspired by Douglas Niebur's work [5,6] on automorphic forms and integrals of negative weight.We prove that an arbitrary Niebur modular integral (including a modular form) on the full modular group, Γ (1), of weight k, 0 < k < 1, can be decomposed uniquely as a sum of a cusp form and a finite linear combination of (special values of) pseudo-Poincaré series.We derive exact formulas, as convergent infinite series, for the Fourier coefficients of these pseudo-Poincaré series.In the weight range 0 < k < 2/3, the formulas we produce for these series have precisely the same structure as the well-known expressions for negative weights found by Rademacher and Zuckerman [10]; both involve the modified Bessel function of the first kind and generalized Kloosterman sums.In the weight range 2/3 ≤ k < 1, however, the formulas we discover are not as satisfying because they contain Selberg's Kloosterman zeta-function evaluated outside of its known range of convergence.In our prequel [9] we already found expressions, which contain residues of the zeta-function just mentioned, for the Fourier coefficients of small positive powers (between 0 and 2) of the Dedekind eta-function.So our decomposition theorem implies that we possess the Fourier expansions of all Niebur modular integrals on Γ (1) of weight k, 0 < k < 1.The results established here mirror those presented in our first paper [9], which focused on Niebur modular integrals in the weight range 1 < k < 2. Recall that this previous paper provided an extension of Knopp's work [4] on the Fourier coefficients of modular forms of weight k, 4/3 < k < 2. Several of the tools we employ here are the same as those used in [4] and 2000",

    "abstract": "Cycle integrals of Maass forms of weight 0 and Fourier coefficients of Maass forms of weight 1/2 by A. Biró (Budapest) 1. Introduction.In [K-S] Katok and Sarnak proved that the sum of the integrals of a Maass cusp form ϕ of weight 0 for the group Γ 0 (1) on certain geodesic cycles of a given discriminant s > 0 (or the sum of ϕ over Heegner points of discriminant s for s < 0) equals the sum of b j (s)b j (1) over an orthonormal basis of the space of those Maass cusp forms of weight 1/2 for Γ 0 (4) whose Shimura lifting (introduced in the holomorphic case in [Shim]) is ϕ, where b j (s) is the sth and b j (1) is the first Fourier coefficient of the jth weight 1/2 form.Here we generalize the s > 0 part of this result to Γ 0 (N ) for arbitrary level N , and for more general products of coefficients b j (s)b j ( s).As a consequence (similarly to [K-S] for Γ 0 (1) and the trivial character) we prove that the L-function of a Maass-Hecke newform for Γ 0 (N ) twisted by a quadratic character is nonnegative at the centre of the critical strip (this was first proved in [G]; it would be a trivial consequence of the Riemann Hypothesis for this L-function).In the course of proof we show that if N is even, then the Shimura liftings of any Maass cusp form of weight 1/2 for Γ 0 (4N ) are automorphic of level N , i.e. for Γ 0 (N ) (and not just for Γ 0 (2N )).The first paper studying this phenomenon was that of Maass ([M]).The holomorphic case was considered inand [Ko-Z].So the holomorphic case was developed in greater generality than the theorem of Katok and Sarnak.Our result is similar to the main result of [Ko2], where the holomorphic case is considered for Γ 0 (N ), but N is restricted to be odd and squarefree.Our method of proof is completely different from the proofs in the abovementioned papers; the idea of our proof is briefly discussed in Section 3. We do not use theta-functions and kernel functions for the Shimura lifting.Our proof is based on the idea of [B] (but we do not refer to that paper, the relevant formula is developed in Section 5) and on Kuznetsov's formula 2000",

    "abstract": "Bounds for the degrees of CM-fields of class number one bySofiène Bessassi (Caen) Introduction.A number field K is said to be a CM-field if K is a totally imaginary quadratic extension of its maximal totally real subfield k.According to class field theory, if K is a CM-field then the class number h k of k divides the class number h K of K and h - K = h K /h k , which is a divisor of h K , is called the relative class number of K.If n denotes the degree of k, then K is of even degree 2n.Notice that an imaginary abelian number field is always a CM-field, whereas a normal imaginary number field is a CM-field if and only if the complex conjugation is in the center of its Galois group Gal(K/Q) (which implies that k also is a normal number field).In 1974, A. M. Odlyzko proved that there are only finitely many normal CM-fields of a given class number (see [22]).In 1979, J. Hoffstein showed that normal CM-fields of degrees greater than or equal to 436 have relative class number greater than one (see [11]).In 1994, K. Yamamura completed the determination of all the abelian CM-fields of class number one: there are 172 such CM-fields and their degrees are less than or equal to 24 (see [36]).Since 1994, various authors have been working on the determination of all the non-abelian normal CM-fields with class number one (see [5]]).The current strategy for solving this problem is first to solve this class number one problem for the normal CM-fields of a given Galois group (see [12], [13], [16], [20]), namely the normal CM-fields of any degree with dihedral or dicyclic Galois group (the reason why these two situations are of paramount importance is that if K is a non-abelian normal CM-field of degree 4p, p any odd prime, then since the complex conjugation must be in the center of its Galois group, this Galois group is isomorphic either to the dihedral group of order 4p or to the dicyclic group of order 4p).Then one tries to solve the class number one problem for the non-abelian",

    "abstract": "A sequence S of terms from an abelian group is zero-sum if the sum of the terms of S is zero. In 1961 Erdős, Ginzburg and Ziv proved that any sequence of 2m− 1 terms from an abelian group of order m contains an m-term zero-sum subsequence [10]. This sparked a flurry of generalizations, variations and extensions [1] [3] [7] [8] [11] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [22] [26] [27] [28] [37]. Since a sequence from the cyclic group Z/mZ consisting of only 0’s and 1’s has its m-term zerosum subsequences in exact correspondence with its m-term monochromatic subsequences, then the Erdős-Ginzburg-Ziv Theorem can be viewed as a generalization of the pigeonhole principle for m pigeons and 2 boxes. In essence, the Erdős-Ginzburg-Ziv Theorem expresses the idea that often the best way to avoid zero-sums is to consider sequences with very few distinct terms. For sequences whose length is greater than 2m−1, a natural question to ask is how many m-term zero-sum subsequences can one expect. If the sequence S has length n and consists of at most two distinct terms, then there will be at least (dn 2 e m ) + (bn 2 c m ) m-term monochromatic subsequences.

In this paper we develop the theory of binary quadratic forms in order to determine the Euler product for ∑∞ n=1 a(n)n −s, and other similarly defined Dirichlet series, in a completely elementary and natural manner. Let N, Z, R and C be the sets of natural numbers, integers, real numbers and complex numbers respectively. A nonsquare integer d with d ≡ 0, 1 (mod 4) is called a discriminant. The conductor of the discriminant d is the largest positive integer f = f(d) such that d/f ≡ 0, 1 (mod 4). As usual we set w(d) = 1, 2, 4, 6 according as d > 0, d 0 and c > 0. Two forms (a, b, c) and (a′, b′, c′) are equivalent ((a, b, c) ∼ (a′, b′, c′)) if there exist integers α, β, γ and δ with αδ − βγ = 1 such that the substitution x = αX+βY, y = γX+δY transforms (a, b, c) to (a′, b′, c′). It is known that (a, b, c) ∼ (c,−b, a) and for k ∈ Z that (a, b, c) ∼ (a, 2ak + b, ak + bk + c). We denote the equivalence class of (a, b, c) by [a, b, c].

    "abstract": "Introduction.In a series of papers [9], [5], and [10], the second author attempted to generalize the notion of Serre's p-adic Eisenstein series and obtained several interesting formulas.For example, in the Siegel modular case [9], a correspondence between p-adic Siegel-Eisenstein series and theta series was reported.More precisely, certain p-adic Siegel-Eisenstein series were shown to coincide with the genus theta series of level p.This indicates a remarkable relationship between p-adic Siegel modular forms and Siegel modular forms on the congruence subgroup Γ 0 (p) of the so-called Nebentypus (in the sense of Hecke).In this paper, we show that a similar phenomenon occurs for Haupttypus.Namely, we construct a p-adic Siegel-Eisenstein series which coincides with the genus theta series of discriminant p 2 and level p.As an application, we show that the constructed weight 2 form is congruent to a Siegel modular form of weight p + 1 on the full Siegel modular group. Definitions and notation1.1.Siegel modular forms.Let H n be the Siegel upper-half space of degree n; then Γ (n) := Sp n (R) ∩ M 2n (Z) acts discontinuously on H n .For a congruence subgroup Γ of Γ (n) , we denote by M k (Γ ) the corresponding space of Siegel modular forms of weight k.Later we mainly deal with the case Γ = Γ (n) or Γ (n) 0 (N ) where Γ (n) 0 (N ) := A B C D ∈ Γ (n) C ≡ O n (mod N ) .In both cases, F ∈ M k (Γ ) has a Fourier expansion of the form 2000",

    "abstract": "We give a small, but very useful modification of a criterion of Mignotte ([4]) for Catalan’s equation, replacing the class number of a certain abelian field by the relative class number, which is much easier to compute. The proof is the same, apart from the idea to consider the class group modulo the ideals coming from the real subfield. We use the following notation: K is a CM-field, IK its group of fractional ideals and i : K∗ → IK the canonical map x 7→ (x); j denotes complex conjugation, K+ the maximal real subfield and h−(K) the relative class number of K; OK is the ring of integral elements of K. Lemma 1. Let K be a CM-field and Q a finite set of prime ideals of K. There is a subgroup I0 of the ideal group IK such that (i) the prime ideals in Q do not appear in the factorization of any ideal in I0; (ii) IK/(i(K∗)I0) has cardinality h−(K) or 2h−(K); (iii) if e ∈ K∗ with (e) ∈ I0, then e1−j is a root of unity. P r o o f. Let I0 consist of those ideals which are in the image of the canonical map IK+ → IK , and which do not contain any prime ideal in Q. If (e) ∈ I0, then (e) = (e), so e1−j is a unit, hence also a root of unity because all its conjugates have absolute value 1 (cf. [6], Lemma 1.6). It remains to show (ii). It is an easy consequence of the approximation theorem that every ideal class contains an ideal without primes in Q (see e.g. [3], IV, Corollary 1.4). Therefore IK/(i(K∗)I0) = ideal class group of K modulo image of the ideal class group of K+. By [6], Theorem 10.3, at most 2 ideal classes of K+ become principal in K, so the statement follows. Theorem 1. Let p 6= q be odd prime numbers. Let ζ be a primitive p-th root of unity and K an imaginary subfield of L := Q(ζ). Catalan’s equation x − y = 1 has no nontrivial integral solution if q -h−(K) and pq−1 6≡ 1 mod q2.",

This is perhaps best illustrated by the seminal works of Vinogradov from the first half of this century (see, for example, [1, 6]). Despite modern developments, such estimates remain the primary tool in establishing the best known results concerning the zerofree region of the Riemann zeta function, and the smallest number G(k) of variables for which the asymptotic formula holds in Waring’s problem. When s k + 1 the latter asymptotic formula seems far beyond the grasp of current technology. Our primary purpose in this memoir is to establish in a rather sharp form the desired asymptotic formula in the case s = k + 1. When s is a natural number, let Ts(P ) denote the number of s-tuples x and y in which 1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ P (1 ≤ i ≤ s), and the xi are a permutation of the yj , so that in particular, Ts(P ) = s!P s + Os(P s−1). In Section 2 we establish the strong form below of the asymptotic formula Jk+1,k(P ) ∼ Tk+1(P ), and in connection with this we define (1.2) αn = min 1≤r≤n r∈N (r + n/r).",

    "abstract": "Introduction. The problems of “factorisatio numerorum”, which go back more than 65 years, are concerned principally with (i) the total number f(n) of factorizations of a natural number n > 1 into products of natural numbers larger than 1, where the order of the factors is not counted, and (ii) the corresponding total number F (n) of factorizations when the order of the factors is counted. For example, f(12) = 4 while F (12) = 8. Some results and further references on such problems may be found in [1], [2], [5], [6] and [7] in particular. The object of this paper is to consider similar problems and results, with emphasis on the average numbers of factorizations of each kind, within the partly analogous but also quite distinct context of additive arithmetical semigroups. Such semigroups (to be defined below) are treated in the monographs [3], [4] within an abstract setting designed to conveniently cover (under minimal assumptions) concrete cases like (i) the multiplicative semigroup Gq of all monic polynomials in one indeterminate over a finite field Fq, (ii) semigroups of ideals in principal orders within algebraic function fields over Fq, (iii) semigroups formed under direct sum by the isomorphism classes of certain kinds of finite modules or algebras over such principal orders. Although the first main result below will be derived within a still more general framework, we shall formulate and state our second main conclusion within a context (see [4]) which conveniently covers the preceding concrete cases: An (additive) arithmetical semigroup will be understood to be a free commutative semigroup G with identity element 1, generated by a (countable) set P of “prime” elements, which admits an integer-valued “degree”",

    "abstract": "1. Introduction. Let Fq denote the finite (Galois) field of order q, a power of a prime p. The multiplicative groupF q ofFq is cyclic of order q 1: a generator is known as a primitive element ofFq. HenceFq contains (q 1) primitive elements, where is Euler’s function. Generally, primitivity is a fragile property that may be destroyed when the element in question is modified through multiplication or addition. Nevertheless, if is a primitive element, then so is 1/ . When q = 2, H. Niederreiter [Ni] has expressed the number of irreducible polynomials of degreen ( 3) over the binary fieldF2, having the coecients of x n 1 and x both equal to 1, as a formula involving Kloosterman sums overF2 n. Thereby, this number is shown to be positive, except when n = 3. An alternative formulation of this conclusion is that, except when n = 3, F2n contains an element such that F2n = F2( ), and both and 1/ have (F2n,F2)-trace equal to 1. In this paper we consider extensions Fqn of a general finite field Fq. The aim is to show that Kloosterman sums are adequate for the stier task of generalising the above result (when",

    "abstract": "Among other things we show that for each n-tuple of positive rational numbers (a_1,..., a_n) there are sets of primes S of arbitrarily large cardinality s such that the solutions of the equation a_1x_1+..+a_nx_n=1 with x_1,..,x_n S-units are notcontained in fewer than exp((4+o(1)) s^{1/2} (log s)^{-1/2} proper linear subspaces of C^n. This generalizes a result of Erdos, Stewart and Tijdeman for S-unit equations in two variables. Further, we prove that for any algebraic number field K of degree n, any integer m with 1<= m<n, and any sufficiently large s there are integers b_0,..,b_min K which are linearly independent over the rationals, and prime numbers p_1,..,p_s, such that the normpolynomial equation|N_{K/\\Q}(b_0+b_1x_1+.. +b_mx_m)|=p_1^{z_1}..p_s^{z_s} has at leastexp(1+o(1)){n/m}s^{m/n}(\\log s)^{-1+m/n}solutions in integers x_1,..,x_m,z_1,..,z_s.This generalizes a result of Moree and Stewart for m=1. Our main tool, also established in this paper, is an effective lower bound for the number of ideals in a number field K of norm <=X composed of prime ideals which lie outside a given finite set of prime ideals T and which have norm <=Y. This generalizes results of Canfield, Erdos and Pomerance and of Moree and Stewart.",

    "abstract": "Introduction.A theorem of Ax and Kochen [3] provides conditional confirmation of Artin's conjecture.Let n, t and d 1 , . . ., d t be natural numbers.Then Ax and Kochen show that there is a positive integer p 0 with the following property.Let K be a p-adic field with [K : Q p ] = n, and suppose that f 1 , . . ., f t ∈ K[x] are homogeneous with respective degrees d 1 , . . ., d t , and possess sThen whenever p > p 0 , these polynomials have a common non-trivial K-rational zero.Familiar examples, involving suitable linear combinations of norm forms, demonstrate that no such conclusion is available when the hypothesis on s is relaxed.Investigations have consequently focused on bounding the least permissible value of p 0 , an integer that we denote by M (d; n).Artin's conjecture, formulated around 1936 (see the preface to [2]), implies that for all choices of d and n, one may take M (d; n) = 1.An example of Terjanian [30] shows that M (4; 1) ≥ 2, thereby disproving this conjecture, and more recently Chakri and Hanine [11] have established that M (d; 1) ≥ (1 + o(1)) √ d for infinitely many even exponents d (see also [1], [9] and [26] for earlier work).Reasonable upper bounds for M (d; n) are known only in a handful of cases.The object of this paper is to obtain improvements in two cases, namely for forms of degree 7 and 11, sufficient to place them in the latter select category.In §3 of this paper we establish the following theorem.",

Many different proofs have been given for this theorem, namely Hilbert’s (1892) [H], Mertens’s (1911) [Me], Skolem’s (1921) [Sk], Dorge’s (1927) [Do], Siegel’s (1929) [Si], Eichler’s (1939) [Ei], Inaba’s (1943) [In], Fried’s (1974) [Fr], Roquette’s (1975) [Ro], Cohen’s (1981) [Co], Sprindžuk’s (1981) [Spr], Debes’s (1986) [De1], (1993) [De2]. Only the last of the quoted papers explicitly mentions the problem of estimating the size of a t∗ with the above property in terms of the degree and height of F . By the height of F , to be abbreviated H(F ), we mean the maximum absolute value of the coefficients of a constant multiple of F that has coprime integer coefficients. Debes gives actually an estimate valid for several polynomials Fi. His result reads (see Cor. 3.7 of [De2]): Let F1, . . . , Fh be irreducible polynomials in Q[t, x] such that degFi ≤ D and H(Fi) ≤ H (1). Then there exists a rational number t∗ = u/v such that each Fi(t∗, x) is irreducible over Q and",

The subfields of H we are interested in here are among those appearing in [G-S-X, Theorem 5.4]. It will turn out that they can be described by using Chebyshev polynomials (see Remarks 4.4 and 5.2).

At the end of his brief communication [9], [10, p. 231] announcing his proofs of the Rogers–Ramanujan identities (1.2), Ramanujan remarks, “I have now found an algebraic relation between G(q) and H(q), viz.: H(q) {G(q)} − qG(q) {H(q)} = 1 + 11q {G(q)H(q)} . (1.3) Another noteworthy formula is H(q)G(q)− qG(q)H(q) = 1. (1.4) Each of these formulae is the simplest of a large class.” Ramanujan did not indicate how he had proved the identities. They are two identities from a set of forty identities for G(q) and H(q) that he never published. In the years since then, most of the 40 identities were established in a series of papers by L. J. Rogers [13] in 1919, G. N. Watson [14] in 1933, D. Bressoud [6], [7] in 1977, and A. J. F. Biagioli [3] in 1989. It should be remarked that the complete list of identities was not brought to the mathematical public until 1975 when B. J. Birch [4] found them in the Oxford University Library. Although all the identities can be proved using the theory of modular forms, the method employed by Biagioli, it is more instructive to",

Introduction.The purpose of this paper is to explicitly compute some examples of Weyl group multiple Dirichlet series over the rational function field F q (t).As described in [2], these are Dirichlet series in r complex variables s 1 , . . ., s r whose coefficients can be expressed in terms of nth order Gauss sums.The general theory implies that over a function field, these multiple Dirichlet series will be rational functions of q -s 1 , . . ., q -sr .Except when n = 2, no examples of these rational functions have been written down.Using explicit knowledge of the functional equations, we will express the A 2 series as a rational function of q -s 1 and q -s 2 .This is the main result of this paper and is given in Theorem 4.2.The functional equations of multiple Dirichlet series arise from the functional equations of single variable Gauss sum Dirichlet series of the type initially studied by Kubota [17] using the theory of metaplectic Eisenstein series on the n-fold cover of GL 2 .This theory was further developed by Kazhdan and Patterson [16] who studied Eisenstein series on the n-fold cover of GL r .It is conjectured that the Weyl group multiple Dirichlet series are related to Whittaker coefficients of these metaplectic Eisenstein series.This conjecture and much supporting evidence for it is given in [2,4] In [2] is described a heuristic method to associate to a positive integer n, and a root system Φ of rank r, a multiple Dirichlet series Z in r complex variables with coefficients given by nth order Gauss sums.Moreover, Z is expected to have an analytic continuation to C r and to satisfy a group of functional equations isomorphic to W , the Weyl group of the root system.Brubaker, Bump, and Friedberg [3] have given a precise definition of Z in the stable case; by definition, this means n is sufficiently large for a fixed Φ.In [3] the authors show that for such n, the Weyl group multiple Dirichlet",

For a sequence S of points x1, x2, . . . in [0, 1] s, the star discrepancy of the first N terms of S is defined as D∗ N (S) = D ∗ N (x1, . . . , xN ). We say that S is a low-discrepancy sequence if D N (S) = O(N (logN)) for all N ≥ 2. This is conjectured to be the least possible order of magnitude of the star discrepancy that can be obtained, and the conjecture has been proved for s = 1 by Schmidt [21] (see also [8, Section 2.2]). Currently, the most powerful methods of constructing low-discrepancy sequences are built on the theory of (t, s)-sequences which was developed by Niederreiter [11] on the basis of earlier work by Sobol’ [24] and Faure [3]. We refer to the monographs [13, Chapter 4] and [20, Chapter 8] as well as to the recent survey article [14] for general background on this theory. The fact that, for any integers s ≥ 1 and b ≥ 2, there exists a (t, s)-sequence in base b for some integer t ≥ 0 was first shown by Niederreiter [12]. The star discrepancy of a (t, s)-sequence S in base b satisfies the following bound (see [11] and [13, Chapter 4]): D N (S) ≤ Cb(s, t)N (logN) +O(N(logN)) for all N ≥ 2,",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study a new notion of diaphony, namely the hybrid diaphony (see [8]) of a special sort of a finite hybrid sequence that has first been introduced in [18], the mix of a Halton sequence in prime bases and a lattice point set modulo a prime.We derive a previously unknown upper bound on the diaphony of such point sets.Our technique shows how to employ the b-adic method for this kind of problems and exhibits, for the first time, the interplay between classical techniques for estimating particular exponential sums and the new hybrid approach.Let us outline the problem under consideration in the next two sections.1.1.Basic definitions and the b-adic function system.We recall the following concepts from [7,8,10].Throughout this paper, b denotes a positive integer, b ≥ 2, and b = (b 1 , . . ., b s ) stands for a vector of not necessarily distinct integers b i ≥ 2, 1 ≤ i ≤ s.Further, p denotes a prime, and p = (p 1 , . . ., p s ) represents a vector of not necessarily distinct primes p i , 1 ≤ i ≤ s.We write N for the positive integers, and we put N 0 = N ∪ {0}.We will use the standard convention that empty sums have the value 0 and empty products the value 1.We consider the s-dimensional torus R s /Z s , which will be identified with the half-open interval [0, 1) s .We put e(y) = e 2πiy for y ∈ R, where i is the imaginary unit.For a nonnegative integer k, let k = j≥0 k j b j , k j ∈ {0, 1, . . ., b -1}, be the unique b-adic representation of k in base b.With the exception of at most finitely many indices j, the digits k j are equal to 0. Every real number x ∈ [0, 1) has a b-adic representation x = j≥0 x j b -j-1 , with digits x j ∈ {0, 1, . . ., b -1}.If x is a b-adic rational, which means that x = ab -g , a and g integers, 0 ≤ a < b g , g ∈ N, and if x = 0, then there exist two such representations.The b-adic representation of x is uniquely determined under the condition that x j = b -1 for infinitely many j.In the following, we will call this particular representation the regular (b-adic) representation of x.Let Z b denote the compact group of the b-adic integers.We refer the reader to Hewitt and Ross [11] and Mahler [23] for details.An element z of Z b will be written in the form z = j≥0 z j b j , with digits z j ∈ {0, 1, . . ., b-1}.The set Z of integers is embedded in Z b .If z ∈ N 0 , then at most finitely many digits z j are different from 0. If z ∈ Z, z < 0, then at most finitely many digits z j are different from b -1.In particular, -1 = j≥0 (b -1)b j .Definition 1.1.The map ϕ b : Z b → [0, 1) given by ϕ b ( j≥0 z j b j ) = j≥0 z j b -j-1 (mod 1) will be called the b-adic Monna map.The restriction of ϕ b to N 0 is often called the radical-inverse function in base b.The Monna map is surjective, but not injective.It may be inverted in the following sense.",

If we fix $F$ and $d$ and examine the values of $W_{F,d}(a)$ as $a$ runs through $F^\\times$, we always obtain at least three distinct values unless $d$ is degenerate (a power of the characteristic of $F$ modulo $|F^\\times|$). Choices of $F$ and $d$ for which we obtain only three values are quite rare and desirable in a wide variety of applications. We show that if $F$ is a field of order $3^n$ with $n$ odd, and $d=3^r+2$ with $4 r \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$, then $W_{F,d}(a)$ assumes only the three values $0$ and $\\pm 3^{(n+1)/2}$. This proves the 2001 conjecture of Dobbertin, Helleseth, Kumar, and Martinsen.

Introduction.The history of numerical solution of Diophantine equations began in 1969, when Baker and Davenport [1] solved completely a system of two Pell equations.They used the well-known fact that every \"large\" solution gives rise to a \"very small\" value of a linear formwhere α 0 , α 1 and α 2 are explicitly given algebraic numbers) at an integral point (b 1 , b 2 ).Using Baker's theory of logarithmic forms, they obtained a huge (around 10 400 ) upper bound for max(|b 1 |, |b 2 |).After this, expanding log α 2 /log α 1 into a continued fraction, they showed that |Λ(b 1 , b 2 )| cannot be too small when b 1 and b 2 run through the integers below the huge bound.Therefore the system cannot have \"large\" solutions, while \"small\" solutions can be easily enumerated.This idea was developed in various directions by Pethő, Tzanakis, de Weger, and many other authors.The subject became especially popular when Lenstra, Lenstra and Lovász [11] suggested a polynomially quick algorithm for finding an almost shortest vector in a lattice (referred to as LLL-algorithm in the sequel).The LLL-algorithm made it possible to extend the idea of Baker and Davenport to logarithmic forms in three or more variables, when continued fractions are not efficient any more.See [18,12] for a detailed description of the methods, history of the subject and extensive bibliography up to 1989.In [4] we showed that one can solve Diophantine equations of Thue using only continued fractions (as Baker and Davenport did), and without involving the LLL-algorithm.This allowed us to solve completely Thue equations of rather high degree.In [5] we extended our method to superelliptic Diophantine equations (see also [3]).",

    "abstract": "Introduction. In his paper Diophantine approximation on abelian varieties [1], Faltings proved, among other things, the following conjecture of Weil and Lang: if A is an abelian variety over a number field k and X a subvariety of A not containing a translate of a positive dimensional abelian subvariety of A, then X contains only finitely many k-rational points. One of Faltings’ basic tools was a new non-vanishing result of his, also proved in [1], the so-called (arithmetic version of the) Product Theorem. It has turned out that this Product Theorem has a much wider range of applicability in Diophantine approximation. For instance, recently Faltings and Wustholz gave an entirely new proof [2] of Schmidt’s Subspace Theorem [15] based on the Product Theorem. Faltings’ Product Theorem is not only very powerful for deriving new qualitative finiteness results in Diophantine approximation but, in an explicit form, it can be used also to derive significant improvements of existing quantitative results. In the present paper, we work out an explicit version of the arithmetic version of the Product Theorem; except for making explicit some of Faltings’ arguments from [1] this did not involve anything new. By using the same techniques we improve Roth’s lemma from [12]. Roth’s lemma was used by Roth in his theorem on the approximation of algebraic numbers by rationals [12] and later by Schmidt in his proof of the Subspace Theorem [15]. In two subsequent papers we shall apply our improvement of Roth’s lemma to derive significant improvements on existing explicit upper bounds for the number of subspaces in the Subspace Theorem, due to Schmidt [16] and Schlickewei [14] and for the number of solutions of norm form equations [17] and S-unit equations [13].",

Certain cases of (1) were studied extensively by different authors. For a survey of results about the transformations considered by Mahler see [M4], [K1], [L], [LP]. If T (z) is a polynomial, the transcendence of f(α) for algebraic α was proved by Nishioka [Ni1]. This was generalized to algebraic functions T (z) by Becker in [B3]. Applications to Bottcher functions were given by Becker and Bergweiler [BB], and transcendence measures for these functions can be found in [B4] (see also [NT]). The algebraic independence of several values f1(α), . . . , fm(α) was proved by Becker [B2] for certain rational transformations T (z) under additional technical assumptions. Since a general zero order estimate for functions satisfying (2) with z replaced by rational functions T (z) was proved in [T3], we will give an application of the zero order estimate in this paper and derive measures for the algebraic independence of the values of the functions considered by Becker in [B2]. Furthermore we give lower bounds for the transcendence degree of Q(f1(α), . . . , fm(α)) over Q, if f1, . . . , fm satisfy functional equations with more general rational transformations T (z).",

Note that, if the last condition is not satisfied, then A2/A1 = D2/D1 = q 2 for some q ∈ Q and the solutions (X, Y, Z) of the system of equations are given by (X, Y, qX), where (X, Y ) is a solution of the first equation of the system. A large number of papers is devoted to the study of simultaneous Pell equations; they could be classified into three categories: The first one includes papers, in which results are proved of the type “there are no solutions”, or “there are at most k solutions”, where k is a number between, say, 1 and 4; such are the papers [4],[5],[6],[7],[8],[20],[21], [26],[38],[39],[40]. The generality of such results is obtained at the cost of restricting at least two parameters among A1, D1, A2, D2.

Perron [9] is a generalization of the continued fraction algorithm.Applied to an n-uple of real numbers, it gives simultaneous approximations.In case of periodicity it yields a unit of a number field which commands the quality of simultaneous approximations.We prove that for n = 2 this unit is a Pisot number (positive algebraic integer with each conjugate in |z| < 1) and that this is not necessarily the case for n ≥ 3.The problem of characterizing the periodicity of JPA (Jacobi-Perron Algorithm) is still open for n ≥ 2. Many families of sets of n real numbers for which the JPA is periodic were found by L. Bernstein [2], E. Dubois & R. Paysant-Le Roux [5], C. Levesque & G. Rhin [8].M. Bouhamza for n = 3 and n = 4 [3, 4], and then E. Dubois and R. Paysant-Le Roux for every n [6] proved that there exists, in any real number field of degree n + 1, an n-uple of real numbers with periodic JPA.Recently B. Adam & G. Rhin [1] found a method yielding all pairs of real numbers with periodic JPA which produce a given unit in a real cubic field.In many examples they get no set with periodic JPA when the given unit is not a Pisot number.So they ask if this is always true.In this paper we give a positive answer in case n = 2 and we prove that this is not always true for n ≥ 3.I.

Further, we give an explicit upper bound for the number of irreducible binary forms with rational integral coefficients with given invariant order. Our bounds depend on as few parameters as possible. For instance, we show that the number of equivalence classes of irreducible binary forms with rational integral coefficients of degree r with given invariant order has an upper bound depending only on r. We have proved more general results for binary forms with coefficients in the ring of S-integers of a number field.",

    "abstract": "1. Introduction.Elliptic curve public-key cryptosystems over F q have become widely used in applications since N. Koblitz and V. Miller proposed using elliptic curves over F q to construct public-key cryptosystems.Roughly speaking, the elliptic curve cryptosystems can be considered as pseudorandom sequence generators.If these sequences have good pseudorandomness, then they can be used for generating random numbers, which are very useful in cryptography and communications.Many scholars have studied elliptic curve sequences with strong cryptographic properties.For example, B. S. Kaliski [12] first used elliptic curves to construct pseudorandom sequences by using randomness criteria based on the computational difficulty of the discrete logarithm over the elliptic curves.S. Hallgren [8] discussed some heuristics of the linear congruentia generator over elliptic curves.G. Gong, T. A. Berson and D. R. Stinson [4] constructed a class of binary sequences by applying trace functions to elliptic curves over F 2 m , and discussed the least periods, linear complexities and 0-1 distributions of these sequences.E. E. Mahassni and I. Shparlinski [16] obtained a bound for the uniform distribution of the congruential generators over elliptic curves.Meanwhile, P. H. T. Beelen and J. M. Doumen [1] proved an upper bound for some exponential sums on algebraic curves over finite fields, and studied some sequences constructed from elliptic curves.G. Gong and C. C. Y. Lam [5] introduced linear recursive sequences over elliptic curves.Moreover, C. P. Xing et al. constructed some sequence families with both large linear complexity and low correlation in [22] and [23].F. Hess and I. Shparlinski [9] studied the linear complexity and multidimensional distribution of the congruential generators over elliptic curves.Recently H. Hu, L. Hu and D. Feng [10] investigated a general method for",

Introduction.Let A, B be finite subsets of Z/nZ such that |A|, |B| ≥ 2 + 2s and |AFor n prime and s = 0, Vosper's Theorem [17] states that A and B are r-progressions for some step r.For n prime and s = 1, the authors of [9] proved that there is an r such that each of the sets A and B is obtained by deleting one element from an r-progression.Some applications of the last result may be found in the literature.In particular, it is used recently by Nazarewicz, O'Brien, O'Neill and Staples in the characterization of equality cases in Pollard's Theorem [14].The authors of [10] obtained a description of the sets A, B if s = 1, 0 ∈ B and if every element of B \\ {0} generates Z/nZ.Kemperman's structure Theorem [11] is a deep classical result, giving a recursive reconstruction of subsets A, B of an abelian group with |A + B| = |A| + |B| -1.A dual equivalent reconstruction is given by Lev [13].Recently Grynkiewicz [2] obtained a recursive reconstruction for the subsets A, B of an abelian group with |A + B| = |A| + |B|.Using hyper-atoms and the strong isoperimetric property, the author obtained in [8] a description of the subgroups appearing in the reconstructions of Kemperman and Lev.In the present work, we investigate a more complicated hyper-atom structure.The above mentioned results follow as corollaries, in a relatively short space, from one of our main theorems.Most of the ingredients of our approach works in the non-abelian case.We need some terminology in order to present our results:Let S be a generating subset of an abelian group G with 0 ∈ S. For a subset X ⊂ G, we put ∂ S (X) = (X + S) \\ X and X S = G \\ (X + S).We say that S is k-separable if there is an X such that |X| ≥ k and |X S | ≥ k.",

Several ways of representing the product in (1) by a determinant are known, some of them holding for certain types of fields only (see Carlitz and Olson [1], Hazama [5] and further references in Hirabayashi [6]). Here our main concern is a unified approach to the Maillet determinant on the one hand and to the Demyanenko determinant on the other hand. This approach relies on the “b-division vector” introduced by Girstmair [3]. We obtain a relative class number formula for an arbitrary imaginary abelian number field which generalizes formulae of Girstmair [2] and [6]. Tsumura [7] also generalized both type of determinant formulae, but his generalization for the Demyanenko determinant requires the oddness of the conductor.",

Introduction.On sait que les seuls sous-groupes résolubles transitifs du groupe symétrique S 5 sont isomorphes au groupe de Frobenius F 20 , au groupe diédral D 5 et au groupe cyclique C 5 .Nous montrerons comment construire des extensions de degré 5 à groupe de Galois résoluble à l'aide de courbes elliptiques.Dans un premier paragraphe nous utiliserons une courbe elliptique ayant un point de 5-torsion rationnel pour les groupes D 5 et C 5 .Puis, dans le paragraphe suivant, nous utiliserons une courbe elliptique ayant un sous-groupe rationnel d'ordre 5 pour construire des extensions à groupe de Galois F 20 .Reprenant alors un résultat de A. Brumer nous obtenons un polynôme générique pour F 20 .1.1.Groupe de Frobenius.Rappelons qu'un groupe de Frobenius G de degré premier p ≥ 5 est un sous-groupe transitif de S p tel que tout élément de G différent de l'identité a au plus un point fixe et qu'il existe un élément ayant un point fixe.Un tel groupe peut s'identifier à un sous-groupe du groupe des transformations affines du corps premier F p , c'est-à-dire du groupe A ff (F p ) = {x → ax + b : a ∈ F * p , b ∈ F p }. Il peut aussi s'identifier au produit semi-direct de F p par l'unique sous-groupe H d'ordre l divisant p-1 de F * p .Si l = 1 on obtient le groupe cyclique C p , si l = 2 on obtient le groupe diédral D p .Dans notre cas si p = 5, le troisième cas possible correspond à l = p -1 et nous noterons F 20 ce groupe qui est aussi égal à A ff (F 5 ).Nous utiliserons dans la suite les représentations de ces groupes à l'aide des permutations σ = (1, 4, 5, 2), de carré σ 2 = (1, 5)(2, 4) et τ = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).Les deux permutations σ et τ engendrent un groupe isomorphe à F 20 .Les permutations σ 2 et τ engendrent un groupe isomorphe à D 5 .",

In a previous paper [4] the first two authors constructed a sequence of absolutely irreducible polynomials Pd(x, y) ∈ Z[x, y] of degree d having low height and many integral solutions to Pd(x, y) = 0. (The definition of these polynomials will be recalled in §4.) Here we construct further examples of polynomials of arbitrarily large degree d over Q with many rational zeros, improving the known record for the maximal number of rational zeros of a smooth polynomial in two variables over Q of given large degree. We also construct examples of two variable polynomials having the maximal theoretically possible number of zeros at roots of unity and over finite fields. Finally, we return to the polynomials Pd and show that for certain special values of d they have a few more zeros than were found there. Here is a more precise statements of the results obtained, with a few remarks about each one.",

In these two cases, the nonlinearity of these function is a main concept. In this article, I show that the spectral amplitude of boolean functions, which is linked to their nonlinearity, is of the order of $2^{m/2}\\sqrt{m}$ in mean, whereas its range is bounded by $2^{m/2}$ and $2^m$. Moreover I examine a conjecture of Patterson and Wiedemann saying that the minimum of this spectral amplitude is as close as desired to $2^{m/2}$. I also study a weaker conjecture about the moments of order 4 of their Fourier transform. This article is inspired by works of Salem, Zygmund, Kahane and others about the related problem of real polynomials with random coefficients.",

    "abstract": "We give explicit upper and lower bounds for relative class numbers of imaginary abelian number fields and of nonabelian CM-fields K. We then use them to obtain Brauer-Siegel type results for relative class numbers of CM-fields.The main feature of this paper is a new method which enables us to easily deal with the case where K contains an imaginary quadratic subfield.We will make use of the ideas introduced in [Lou04] to obtain in Theorem 1 upper bounds on |L(1, χ)| for even and odd primitive Dirichlet characters χ, whereas our previous ideas (developed in [Lou98b] and [Lou01]) failed to embrace the case of odd characters.These bounds depend on whether L(s, χ) has or does not have a real zero β in the range 0 < β < 1.They will then enable us to obtain in Theorems 18, 28 and 31 bounds for relative class numbers h - K of CM-fields K, especially in the case that K contains an imaginary quadratic subfield L. Apart from the proof of Lemma 17, which can be found in [Lou03], this paper provides the reader with a self-contained exposition of how one can obtain (as in Corollaries 20, 21, 23 and 25 where several footnotes clearly show that our approach is more efficient than the ones formerly developed by various authors) good enough explicit lower bounds for relative class numbers to enable him to solve various class number problems for CM-fields or to simplify the existing proofs (e.g., see[MM] and [Yam]).Whereas almost all the papers in the literature dealing with explicit lower bounds for relative class numbers of CM-fields (or values at s = 1 of L-functions)",

A lower bound for the cycle length is derived from a generalized lemma of Crandall [3]. For fixed m, an upper bound for the cycle length is found by theoretical approximation of the ratio between numbers in possible cycles and by applying results of Laurent a.o.

For many generalized Syracuse sequences we theoretically and numerically prove the existence of all hypothetical non trivial m-cycles up to a given upper bound for m.",

Let ${\\mathcal B}=\\{\\beta, {\\beta^*}\\}$ be the multi-set of roots of a quadratic polynomial in ${\\mathcal O}[x]$. We show that PCFs $P=[b_1,\\ldots,b_N,\\bar{a_1\\ldots ,a_k}]$ of type $(N,k)$ potentially converging to a limit in ${\\mathcal B}$ are given by ${\\mathcal O}$-points on an affine variety $V:=V({\\mathcal B})_{N,k}$ generically of dimension $N+k-2$. We give the equations of $V$ in terms of the continuant polynomials of Wallis and Euler. The integral points $V({\\mathcal O})$ are related to writing matrices in $\\textrm{SL}_2({\\mathcal O})$ as products of elementary matrices. We give an algorithm to determine if a PCF converges and, if so, to compute its limit. Our standard example generalizes the PCF $\\sqrt{2}=[1,\\bar{2}]$ to the ${\\mathbf Z}_2$-extension of ${\\mathbf Q}$: $F_n={\\mathbf Q}(\\alpha_n)$, $\\alpha_{n}:=2\\cos(2\\pi/2^{n+2})$, with integers ${\\mathcal O}_n={\\mathbf Z}[\\alpha_n]$. We want to find the PCFs of $\\alpha_{n+1}$ over ${\\mathcal O}_{n}$ of type $(N,k)$ by finding the ${\\mathcal O}_{n}$-points on $V({\\mathcal B}_{n+1})_{N,k}$ for ${\\mathcal B}_{n+1}:=\\{\\alpha_{n+1}, -\\alpha_{n+1}\\}$. There are three types $(N,k)=(0,3), (1,2), (2,1)$ such that the associated PCF variety $V({\\mathcal B})_{N,k}$ is a curve; we analyze these curves. For generic ${\\mathcal B}$, Siegel's theorem implies that each of these three $V({\\mathcal B})_{N,k}({\\mathcal O})$ is finite. We find all the ${\\mathcal O}_n$-points on these PCF curves $V({\\mathcal B}_{n+1})_{N,k}$ for $n=0,1$. When $n=1$ we make extensive use of Skolem's $p$-adic method for $p=2$, including its application to Ljunggren's equation $x^2 + 1 =2y^4$.",

Say a trinomial xn + Axm + B 2 Q(x) has reducibility type (n1,n2,...,nk) if there exists a factorization of the trinomial into irreducible polynomials in Q(x) of degrees n1, n2,...,nk, ordered so that n1 � n2 � ... � nk. Specifying the reducibility type of a monic polynomial of fixed degree is equivalent to specifying rational points on an algebraic curve. When the genus of this curve is 0 or 1, there is reasonable hope that all its rational points may be described; and techniques are available that may also find all points when the genus is 2. Thus all corresponding reducibility types may be described. These low genus instances are the ones studied in this paper.",

Schinzel’s original problem was to describe expressions f(x) − g(y), with f, g ∈ C[x] nonconstant, that are reducible. We call (f, g) a Schinzel pair if this happens nontrivially (see (1.3)). When f is indecomposable [Fr73] solved Schinzel’s problem as a corollary. [Fr12] revisits this to expand on many papers affected by the method: especially to circumvent using only covers with primitive monodromy group. We here take the next step to consider the problem left by R. Avanzi and U. Zannier [AZ03], and the 2nd author [Gu10]. Consider those f for which there is a g = α◦f , with α ∈ PGL2(C), satisfying an essential condition for possible Schinzel pairs: The Galois closure of the covers f, g : Px → Pz are the same. Then, from those find (f, g) that are Schinzel pairs.",

Under the assumption that the Kronecker sequence involves a parameter with bounded continued fraction coefficients sharp discrepancy estimates are obtained.

Introduction.On note U le groupe multiplicatif des nombres complexes de module 1 et q un nombre entier supérieur ou égal à 2.On appelle fonction q-multiplicative une fonction χ :Une fonction q-multiplicative est donc entièrement déterminée par la donnée de sa valeur sur l'ensembleLes exemples les plus simples de fonctions q-multiplicatives sont les fonctionssomme des chiffres du nombre entier n écrit en base q.Cette notion a été introduite en 1948 par R. Bellman et H. N. Shapiro dans [1].Les propriétés arithmétiques, spectrales et ergodiques des fonctions q-multiplicatives ont depuis été étudiées par de nombreux auteurs : [2]-[4], [7], [9], [12]-[15], [17], [20], . . .En 1968, A. O. Guelfond a montré dans [7]que pour tout polynôme P à coefficients entiers positifs de degré 1, la suite (s q (P (n))) n∈N est bien répartie dans les progressions arithmétiques en donnant des estimations précises des sommes trigonométriques associées.Lorsque le degré de P est supérieur à 1, le problème devient extrêmement difficile et on ne connaît aucun résultat analogue dans ce cas.Le but de ce travail est de préciser la répartition des fonctions q-multiplicatives dans la suite ([n c ]) n∈N , c > 1.On peut considérer cette suite comme un cas intermédiaire entre les polynômes de degré 1 et ceux de degré 2.Notons que les propriétés arithmétiques de cette suite ont été étudiées à partir de 1953 par I. Piatetski-Shapiro qui a montré en particulier dans [19] que #{n ≤ x : [n c ] est un nombre premier} ∼ x/(c ln x) pour tout c ∈ [1, 12/11[ .Ce résultat a depuis été amélioré par [10], [11], [8], [16] et [22].",

Introduction.Elliptic curves have long been used as tools to prove reciprocity laws.Eisenstein employed elliptic functions to prove cubic, biquadratic, and octic reciprocity laws (we refer the reader to Cassels [C], Hilbert [H], Weil [W1, W2, W3], and Ireland-Rosen [IrR] for references to this work, work by Kummer, and related work by other 19th century mathematicians).Fueter [F] in 1927 proved quadratic reciprocity over all imaginary quadratic fields using the theory of complex multiplication of elliptic curves, and in 1961 Kubota derived cubic and biquadratic reciprocity from the theory of complex multiplication as well [K1].Kubota's and Eisenstein's proofs of cubic and biquadratic reciprocity both used (in some guise) the distribution relation of genus one theta functions that is crucial to the construction of elliptic units.In this paper we continue the theme, deriving the quintic reciprocity law (due first to Kummer) from the main theorems of complex multiplication of abelian varieties applied to the Jacobian J of the curve C : y 2 = x 5 + 1/4.Due to the lack of a distribution relation for higher genus theta functions, little progress has been made in generalizing elliptic units to genus 2 curves [BaBo,BoBa,Gra1,Gra2,Gra3].However, the theorems of complex multiplication and the formal group at the origin of the Jacobian allow us to evaluate products of a function evaluated at torsion points up to fifth powers, which is insufficient for constructing units, but is sufficient for deriving a reciprocity law.Our proof was inspired by Kubota, who in [K2] derived facts about products of functions of torsion points via reciprocity, and we reverse his argument.Let ζ denote a primitive fifth root of 1.Our proof involves studying Kummer extensions of Q(ζ) contained in division fields of J, and, as in [K1], uses \"Gauss' Lemma\" to obtain the reciprocity law.",

Roth [8], obtenue en 1954 : il existe une constante C s > 0 telle que, pour toute suite infinie X, on ait lim sup N →∞ (D * (N, X)/(log N ) s/2 ) ≥ C s .Les deux seules améliorations apportées à ce théorème sont de W. M. Schmidt [9] en 1972 et G. Halász [4] en 1981 qui, par des méthodes différentes, ont obtenu l'ordre log N au lieu de √ log N en dimension un, puis de J. Beck [1] en 1989 qui est passé de log N à (log N )(log log N ) 1/8-ε en dimension deux.Un certain nombre de suites ayant de très faibles irrégularités ont été construites en vue de leur utilisation dans les méthodes d'intégration de Monte Carlo; l'ordre de croissance pour leur discrépance est majoré par (log N ) s en dimension s; compte tenu de la méthode de Roth qui donne en fait une minoration de la discrépance quadratique, on conjecture que (log N ) s est l'ordre exact.",

Put (2) Φ(X) = X − c1Xn−1 − . . .− cn. In what follows, Q and Q denote the fields of rational and algebraic numbers respectively. In 1929, Mahler [4] proved the following theorem: Let {ak}k≥0 be a linear recurrence satisfying (1). Suppose that Φ(X) is irreducible over Q and the roots %1, . . . , %n of Φ(X) satisfy %1 > max{1, |%2|, . . . . . . , |%n|}. If α is an algebraic number with 0 < |α| < 1, then the number ∑∞ k=0 α ak is transcendental. In this paper, we establish two theorems on the algebraic independence of the values of power series generated by linear recurrences with conditions on Φ(X) weaker than those of Mahler (see Remark 1 below). Let {ak}k≥0 and {bk}k≥0 be linear recurrences satisfying (1). We write {ak}k≥0 ∼ {bk}k≥0 if there is a nonnegative integer l such that ak = bk+l (0 ≤ k ≤ n− 1) or bk = ak+l (0 ≤ k ≤ n− 1). Then ∼ is an equivalence relation. Its negation is written as {ak}k≥0 6∼ {bk}k≥0. We denote by f (l)(z) the lth derivative of a function f(z). Theorem 1. Let {a k }k≥0 (i = 1, . . . , s) be linear recurrences satisfying (1). Suppose that Φ(±1) 6= 0 and the ratio of any pair of distinct roots of Φ(X) is not a root of unity. Let",

Nous nous intéressons dans cet article au cas où G est isomorphe à A 4 .L'unique extension non triviale de A 4 par {±1} a une réalisation dans le groupe des quaternions usuels de norme 1 : {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k, (±1 ± i ± j ± k)/2}.L'autre groupe pair en degré 4 est le groupe bicyclique de type (2, 2); c'est le 2-sous-groupe de Sylow de A 4 , et son extension correspondante est le groupe quaternionien H 2 .Lorsque k 0 n'est pas de caractéristique 2, ce qui est le cas dans nos applications, un théorème de Serre ([S1]) permet de lier la possibilité de plonger N/k 0 dans une extension N /k 0 de groupe de Galois G à un calcul d'invariant de Witt de la forme Tr K/k 0 (x 2 ).En outre, dans le cas A 4 , N est la clôture galoisienne d'une extension K/k 0 de degré 8 contenant K/k 0 .Dans cette note, nous considérons le cas où k 0 = Q.Nous calculons des polynômes définissant les corps de groupe de Galois A 4 réalisant les plongements des corps de groupe de Galois A 4 extraits de la table [BPS] de corps de degré 4 et totalement réels; pour cela nous utilisons un critère de plongement arithmétique valable pour k 0 = Q (proposition 1.3), et l'existence d'un \"plongement pur\" (théorème 2.2), c'est-à-dire non ramifié en dehors des idéaux premiers déjà ramifiés dans K.Le théorème 2.5 montre l'existence d'une classe au sens restreint d'ordre 2 pour toute extension de Q de groupe de Galois A 4 totalement réelle.Cette propriété remarquable est aussi vérifiée par toute extension bicyclique de Q plongeable dans une extension quaternionienne.",

For any positive integer m, consider the sequence {u i } obtained by reduction modulo m.If m and b are relatively prime, then {u i } is known to be purely periodic, and therefore it is natural to ask how often each residue occurs in one period of the sequence.This question is surprisingly difficult to answer without restrictions.Even the prerequisite problem of determining the length of the (shortest) period as a function of a, b and m is, in general, beyond reach.Consequently, most authors who consider this question either settle for rough bounds on the maximum or minimum number of occurrences of each residue in one period ([7, 8]) or else severely restrict the sequences and moduli studied ([6, 5]).In this context it is no surprise that the present paper restricts a and b to selected congruence classes of odd integers and m to powers of two.However, the tradeoff for this austerity is a complete characterization of the distribution frequencies of {u i } modulo m.For a fixed two-term recurrence sequence, as defined above, and fixed modulus m and residue r, we denote the number of occurrences (i.e. the \"frequency\") of the residue r in one (shortest) period of {u i } by ν a,b (m, r) (or ν(m, r), when a and b are clear).The function ν(m, r) is called the frequency distribution function of {u i } modulo m.In the early 1970s, interest in the distribution functions of two-term recurrence sequences centered on the characterization of those sequences that have constant frequency distribution functions, i.e., those sequences that are",

Introduction.Recent years have seen the development of a general theory of the Galois module structure of units in a number field (among many others see Chinburg Weiss [17] and the references there).We consider here the case when the number field is a totally real Galois extension N of Q with Galois group the Klein four group.As a Galois module, the group V of units of N modulo {±1} can be of four different types.T. Kubota [9] gave examples to show that each type occurs infinitely often but his examples involve fields N with at most four ramified primes only.In Section 5 we show that among the fields N with exactly r ≥ 3 ramified primes each of the four types occurs infinitely often.In particular, there are infinitely many real biquadratic fields with Minkowski unit and arbitrary many > 1 ramified primes.We believe this is the first example of Minkowski units in noncyclic, totally real extensions with a large number of ramified primes.We investigate the arithmetic conditions which characterize each type.When there are no ideal classes of order four in the class groups of the quadratic subfields of N , rational congruence conditions characterize the module type.Otherwise the problem is much more subtle and involves nonabelian extensions of the rationals and central class fields.Theorem 7 describes a family of examples where the field N has a Minkowski unit exactly when the central class field of N is different from its genus field.We consider in particular the case N = Q( √ p, √ q) with p and q primes.This leads to questions about the 2-part of class groups and the governing fields of Cohn and Lagarias.In Theorem 5 we give an explicit description",

In the process of determining the Galois groups, the irreducibility of the trinomial x + x +m was established, where p represents an odd prime and m an integer ≥ 2. The approach there was based on a method of Lebesgue [Le]. In this paper, we discuss two other approaches we discovered in our investigations, both relying on the nice work of Bilu, Hanrot, and Voutier [BHV] (with an appendix by Mignotte) on Lucas and Lehmer numbers. In the next section, we consider the more general polynomials tp(x) = x +bx+c where b and c are nonzero integers. There are four cases where reducibility is easily established:",

This paper deals with distribution properties of multi-dimensional sequences which are generated by such Q-additive functions. If in each component we have the same Cantor base Q, then we show that uniform distribution already implies well distribution and we provide an if and only if condition under which such sequences are uniformly distributed modulo one. For different Cantor bases in the single coordinate directions the question for uniform distribution becomes much more involved. We give a criterion which is sufficient and, in the case of strongly Q-additive functions, also necessary.",

A simple example is given two subsets A and B of a set of integers, what facts can we determine about A + B where A + B := {a + b | a ∈ A and b ∈ B}? We will state a result regarding this example shortly. We note that a very familiar problem in Number Theory, namely Lagrange’s theorem that every nonnegative integer can be written as the sum of four squares, can be expressed in terms of sumsets. In particular, if we let N0 be the set of nonnegative integers and if we let S be the set of all integers that are perfect squares, then Lagrange’s Theorem has the form",

We are also able to show that these conditions are necessary for certain families of functions, for example, functions of the form $\\varphi(x)=x^d+c$, where $0$ is not a preperiodic point of this map. We study the proportion of periodic points by looking at the fixed point proportion of the Galois groups of certain extensions associated to iterates of the map.",

Introduction.Let V be smooth variety defined over a discretely valued non-Archimedean field K and let φ : V → V be a morphism on V .Assume that there exists a divisor E ∈ Div(V ) ⊗ R and a real number α > 1 such that φ * (E) is linear equivalent to αE.Call and Silverman [7] showed that there exists a Weil local height function λV,E,φ that plays a role analogous to the Néron-Tate local height function on an Abelian variety.In the case of Abelian varieties, the Néron-Tate local height can be computed using intersection theory on the Néron model (see [13,5]) of the Abelian variety in question.This motivates defining an analogous notion for a variety V to which a morphism φ : V → V is attached.Such a generalization was proposed in the same paper [7] and gives rise to the notion of weak Néron model of the couple (V /K, φ) over the ring of integers of K (see also [5, pp.73 ff.] for an alternative definition which has nothing to do with the setting discussed here).It is shown in [7] that indeed if the pair (V /K, φ) has a weak Néron model, then the local height λV,E,φ can also be computed using intersection theory on the model.However, in general a weak Néron model for a given pair (V /K, φ) may not exist.In [10], Hsia showed that for a rational map φ : P 1 → P 1 over K, the existence of a weak Néron model is closely related to dynamical properties of φ and more precisely to the presence of points of the Julia set of φ inside P 1 (K).This leads to the question of whether or not one can effectively determine the existence of a weak Néron model for a given pair (P 1 /K, φ).In the case of elliptic curves (one-dimensional Abelian variety), the Tate algorithm [14] computes, among other things, the reduction type of an el-2010",

    "abstract": "For a prime p, the well-known Wilson congruence says that (p−1)! ≡ −1 modulo p. A prime p is called a Wilson prime, if the congruence above holds modulo p. We now quote from [R95, Pa. 346, 350]: ‘It is not known whether there are infinitely many Wilson primes. In this respect, Vandiver wrote: This question seems to be of such a character that if I should come to life any time after my death and some mathematician were to tell me it had been definitely settled, I think I would immediately drop dead again.’ He also mentions that search (by Crandall, Dilcher, Pomerance [CDP]) up to 5× 10 produced the only known Wilson primes, namely 5, 13, and 563, which was discovered by Goldberg in 1953 (one of the first successful computer searches involving very large numbers). (See [R95, Dic19] for historical references.) Many strong analogies [Gos96, Ro02, Tha04] between number fields and function fields over finite fields have been used to benefit the study of both. These analogies are even stronger in the base case Q,Z ↔ F (t), F [t], where F is a finite field. We will study the concept of Wilson prime in this function field context, and in contrast to the Z case, we will exhibit infinitely many of them, at least for many F . For example, ℘ = t3∗13 n − t13n − 1 are Wilson primes for F3[t]. We also show strong connections between Wilson’s and Fermat’s quotients; between refined Wilson residues and discriminants, and introduce analogs of Bell numbers in F [t] setting.",

Then we will see how a faithful representation of the semigroup by endomorphisms of an affine space gives rise to a matrix divisibility sequence, by considering the Jacobian matrices of the endomorphisms. We will show how most of the commonly known divisibility sequences (mentioned brie y above) arise as determinants of matrix divisibility sequences through interesting semigroups of endomorphisms of affine spaces, often associated to a representation of addition in an algebraic group. For example, Lucas sequences are associated to the 2 x 2 Borel group. We also construct the elliptic matrix divisibility sequence that underlies the usual elliptic divisibility sequences, and prove that it has primitive right matrix divisor classes.",

As usual, V (kn) will denote the set of points of V defined over kn.

In what follows we shall assume that f is defined everywhere on V and has no poles on V , so that f : V → Ak is a morphism. Let ψ0 be a non-trivial additive character on Fp and let ψn = ψ0 ◦ Trkn/ p be the corresponding character on kn; every additive character on kn can be written as ψn(lx) for some l ∈ kn.

    "abstract": "On a problem of Eisenstein byPeter Stevenhagen (Amsterdam) 1. Introduction.In 1844, a list of 11 open problems composed by Eisenstein was published in Crelle's journal [7].Among these problems, which are rather diverse in nature and precision, there are three that pertain to class groups of quadratic orders.Class groups of other orders were still unknown at that time, and Eisenstein's questions are couched in Gauss's language of quadratic forms.In various forms, they ask for \"criteria\" to recognize quadratic discriminants that yield class numbers divisible by an integer n, and to recognize for such discriminants the classes that are in the kernel or the image of the multiplication-by-n map.For n = 2, this is accomplished by Gauss's theory of genera and ambiguous forms.From our modern point of view, it is clear that, in the case of quadratic orders, one cannot hope for an immediate generalization of these results if one replaces n = 2 by n = 3, as is done by Eisenstein in his eighth problem.In fact, the behavior of the odd part of quadratic class groups is in many ways as intractable as it was in Eisenstein's days, and our knowledge of their \"average behavior\" is almost entirely conjectural [2].The problem we will focus on in this paper is Eisenstein's fourth question, which can be seen as a weak version of the problem above for the case n = 3.In this question, we are asked to give a criterion to decide a priori whether the equation x 2 -dy 2 = 4 for a positive integer d ≡ 5 mod 8 is solvable in odd integers x and y.Note that the congruence condition on d is clearly necessary for the existence of such a solution.As Eisenstein indicates, this question is related to the 3-divisibility of the class number of the order O 4d = Z[ √ d] of discriminant 4d.Writing O ∆ and h(∆) for the quadratic order of discriminant ∆ and its class number, respectively, we can formulate this in modern terms in the following way.",

Introduction.La motivation de cet article est le critère de B. de Mathan (voir le théorème 9).A l'origine, ce critère avait été démontré dans [5] par une méthode d'approximation diophantienne.C'est M. Koskas qui était le premier à donner une démonstration en termes de suites automatiques d'un cas particulier du critère de B. de Mathan (cf.[6]).En examinant sa démonstration, nous avons pris conscience que son idée est fondée sur le théorème 6. En modifiant légèrement la démonstration due à B. de Mathan du théorème 9, nous obtenons alors le théorème 10.En appliquant le théorème 5, nous obtenons ensuite une nouvelle démonstration du théorème de M. Mkaouar.La découverte du lien entre la théorie des approximations diophantiennes et la théorie des suites automatiques conduit à un nouvel essor de ces deux théories.De nombreux résultats sont déjà établis ou sont en train d'être établis.Signalons en particulier que B. de Mathan a donné récemment une version quantitative du théorème 1.Rappelons une définition équivalente de la suite automatique.Soient p ≥ 1 un entier et u une suite à valeurs dans un ensemble fini S. La suite u = (u(n)) n≥0 est dite p-automatique si le p-noyau N p (u) défini parest un ensemble fini.Nous remarquons que si u est une suite p-automatique, alors elle est aussi q-automatique pour tout entier q ≥ 2 tel que log p q ∈ Q.Il existe un lien étroit entre les suites automatiques et les séries formelles algébriques que nous allons préciser maintenant.Soient p ≥ 2 un entier premier et k ≥ 1 un entier.Posons q = p k .Notons F q le corps à q éléments, F q [T ] l'anneau des polynômes à coefficients dans F q , F q (T ) le corps des fractions rationnelles à coefficients dans F q et F q ((T -1 )) le corps des séries formelles de Laurent à coefficients dans F q .Pour tout α ∈ F q ((T -1 )), nous écrivons",

    "abstract": "An Egyptian fraction is a sum of distinct unit fractions (reciprocals of positive integers). We show that every rational number has Egyptian fraction representations where the number of terms is of the same order of magnitude as the largest denominator, improving a result from an earlier paper to best-possible form. We also settle, in best-possible form, the related problem of how small M_t(r) can be such that there is an Egyptian fraction representation of r with exactly t terms, the denominators of which are all at most M_t(r). We also consider the following problems posed by Erdos and Graham: the set of integers that cannot be the largest denominator of an Egyptian fraction representation of 1 is infinite - what is its order of growth? How about those integers that cannot be the second-largest (third-largest, etc.) denominator of such a representation? In the latter case, we show that only finitely many integers cannot be the second-largest (third-largest, etc.) denominator of such a representation; while in the former case, we show that the set of integers that cannot be the largest denominator of such a representation has density zero, and establish its order of growth. Both results extend to representations of any positive rational number.",

V. Chudnovsky [2], puis des mesures d'indépendance algébrique de plus en plus fines furent données, par G. V. Chudnovsky lui-même et G. Philibert [9], [6].Une idée de G. V. Chudnovsky [3] (consistant à voir la fonction ℘ de Weierstrass comme variable) permit récemment d'obtenir une mesure « du type H -c » [12] ; malheureusement une erreur s'est glissée dans la démonstration et un facteur logarithme-carré en le degré doit être rajouté.Dans ce texte nous prouvons, en appliquant la méthode de [11], la mesure d'approximation suivante :où A est une constante ne dépendant que de ω et Ω que l'on peut effectivement calculer.Cette mesure entraîne alors la mesure d'indépendance algébrique : Théorème B.

This was the key to their proof of the equivariant Tamagawa number conjecture. A. Huber and G. Kings (Duke Math. J., 2003) also use a variant of the Iwasawa main conjecture to prove the Tamagawa number conjecture for Dirichlet motives. We use the result of the second pair of authors and the Theorem of Ferrero-Washington to reprove the equivariant main conjecture in a slightly more general form. The main idea of the proof is essentially the same as in the paper of D. Burns and C. Greither, but we can replace complicated considerations of Iwasawa $mu$-invariants by a considerably simpler argument.",

    "abstract": "1. Introduction.It is well known that there are infinitely many quadratic number fields with class number divisible by a given integer n (see Nagell [8] (1922) for imaginary fields and Yamamoto [11] (1970) and Weinberger [10] (1973) for real fields).A related question concerns the n-rank of the field, that is, the greatest integer r for which the class group contains a subgroup isomorphic to (Z/nZ) r .In [11], Yamamoto showed that infinitely many imaginary quadratic number fields have n-rank ≥ 2 for any positive integer n ≥ 2. In 1978, Diaz y Diaz [2] developed an algorithm for generating imaginary quadratic fields with 3-rank at least 2, and Craig [1] showed in 1973 that there are infinitely many real quadratic number fields with 3-rank at least 2 and infinitely many imaginary quadratic number fields with 3-rank at least 3.A few examples of higher 3-rank have also been found (see for instance Llorente and Quer [6,9] who found in 1987/1988 three imaginary quadratic number fields with 3-rank 6).In this paper, we give infinite, simply parameterized families of real and imaginary quadratic fields with 3-rank 2. Although the existence of such fields has been known, the fields here are much easier to describe, and the parameterization yields a new lower bound on the number of fields with discriminant < x and 3-rank ≥ 2 (see [7]).The main result is as follows:Theorem 1.1.Let w ≡ ±1 (mod 6), and let c be any integer with c ≡ w (mod 6).Then Q( c(w 2 + 18cw + 108c 2 )(4w 3 -27cw 2 -486c 2 w -2916c 3 )) has 3-rank at least 2.",

    "abstract": "Given an integer q and a primitive character χ modulo q, the functional equation of the Dirichlet L-function L(s, χ) is determined by the signature of χ, i.e. by s(χ) := (χ(−1), τ(χ)), where τ(χ) is the Gauss sum of χ. Several results about the cardinalities of the sets W (χ) := {ψ : s(ψ) = s(χ)} and T (χ) := {ψ : τ(ψ) = τ(χ)}, and of the images of the maps s and τ had been proved in a previous paper when q is either an odd prime power or a composite squarefull number of special form. The different structure of the group Zpk for odd primes p and p = 2 has prevented us the inclusion of the case p = 2 in that paper. This work completes that analysis by proving the analogous results for the prime 2. Acta Arith. 145(1), 71–81 (2010)",

    "abstract": "Introduction.In Hilbert's Zahlbericht one can find the first global result on the Galois module structure of rings of integers ([H], Satz 132).Slightly extended it states that if N/Q is a tame extension with abelian Galois group ∆, then o N , the ring of integers in N , is free as a module over the group ring Z∆; moreover, an explicit canonical algebraic integer a such that o N = Z∆a can be given.The numbers a δ (δ ∈ ∆), the algebraic conjugates of a, are said to form a normal integral basis of the field extension N/Q.This result has been the starting point for a modern development, which has led to the deep result that the structure of o N as a module over Z∆, for arbitrary tame Galois extensions of number fields N/K with Galois group ∆, is determined in terms of the symplectic root numbers of N/K (see [F] and [T1]).Fröhlich's book [F] also contains a detailed introduction and a rather complete list of references.For a more recent survey on Galois module theory we refer to [Ca-Ch-F-T].In the special case that ∆ is of odd order the result mentioned above gives that o N is a free Z∆-module, but the proof does not provide an explicit basis.If one considers the richer o K ∆-module structure of o N rather than the Z∆-module structure alone, then o N is expected to be \"usually\" not even free if K = Q.Results of Taylor show that by modifying both o N and o K ∆ one can sometimes-if K and N are certain ray class fields over imaginary quadratic number fields-achieve the \"ideal\" of free modules with explicit generators (see [C-T]).However, if one decides not to modify the original classical problem of the determination of the o K ∆-module structure of o N , then a natural question is to what extent, for given K and ∆, the realization of ∆ as a Galois group of a tame extension N/K is determined by the ramification of N/K together with the structure of o N as an o K ∆-module.This point of view is worked out in [B2].In a sense the core of the question is how rare unramified extensions which possess a normal integral basis are.We mention in passing that this question is equivalent to a special case of a problem considered by Taylor in recent work, that of determining the kernel [1]",

    "abstract": "The factor c−1 √ n log n is nothing but the asymptotic value of the mean number of summands in a random partition of n, each partition of n being equally likely; cf. [17]. Note that the number of partitions of n with m 1’s is given by p(n −m) − p(n −m − 1) for 0 ≤ m ≤ n; and, consequently, p(n−m) is nothing but the number of partitions of n which have ≥ m 1’s. Thus the factor one plays an important role in the counting function p(n,m) when m is larger than the mean value. Our aim in this paper is to show that such a phenomenon holds for more general partitions. The proof of the theorem is rather simple and relies on a method that we previously employed in [10] (for Dirichlet series) for an analytic proof of a result of Nicolas [15]. From the formula (2), it is obvious that our method is based on explicitly isolating the contribution of the factor 1 to the counting function p(n,m). This method is quite general and can be applied to other partition problems; it can be regarded as analytic version of the sieve of Eratosthenes; cf. [14, Ch. IV]. A general theorem under a scheme due to Meinardus [13] will be derived in § 4, which applies, in particular, to partitions into powers. Finally, we further refine the analysis to establish the limiting distribution (with convergence rate) for the number of summands in partitions into parts ≥ k, 1 ≤ k = o ( n1/4(log n)−1 ) , thus extending and improving the results by Auluck et al. [2]. Notation. We shall use the notation [zn]f(z) to represent the coefficient of zn in the Taylor expansion of f(z). The notation [umzn]g(u, z) is then defined as [um] ([zn]g(u, z)). All limits (including O, , o and ∼), whenever unspecified, will be taken to be n→ +∞. The constant c always denotes √ 2/3π.",

D'autre part, Cassels [4] et Bölling [3] ont montré que X peut être arbitrairement grand (voir aussi [11] pour d'autres résultats).D'autres méthodes effectives ont été développées par Kramer [19], Mai et Murty [23] pour déterminer des courbes elliptiques ayant un grand groupe de Tate-Shafarevich, mais les premières estimations de l'ordre de X ont été conjecturées par Manin et Lang (voir [24] et [21]).Dans cette direction, Goldfeld et Szpiro ([14]) ont proposé la conjecture suivante : Conjecture 1.

Pólya a établi qu'une fonction entière sur C d'ordre exponentiel strictement inférieur à 1 ou d'ordre exponentiel égal à 1 et de type exponentiel inférieur à log 2 prenant des valeurs entières relatives sur N, est un polynôme.M. Car a démontré un analogue de ce théorème de Pólya sur l'anneau des polynômes F q [T ] où F q est le corps fini à q éléments.Des exemples prouvent que le résultat obtenu est optimal pour l'ordre exponentiel, mais ne l'est pas pour le type.Dans cet article, en faisant appel aux déterminants d'interpolation qu'a introduits M. Waldschmidt [6] en caractéristique nulle, nous améliorons, dans le cas où q est assez grand, le résultat établi par M. Car.",

Introduction.Let B denote a compact convex body in s-dimensional Euclidean space, s ≥ 2, which contains the origin as an inner point and whose boundary ∂B is sufficiently smooth.The central question of the classical lattice point theory of large domains is to estimate the lattice point discrepancy of a linearly dilated copy tB, i.e., (1.1)where t is a large real parameter.For enlightening accounts on this topic, the reader is referred to E. Krätzel's monographs [14] and [15], to a recent survey article by A. Ivić, E. Krätzel, M. Kühleitner, and W. G. Nowak [10], and to M. Huxley's book [7] where he presented his breakthrough in the planar case (\"discrete Hardy-Littlewood method\").If ∂B is of bounded nonzero Gaussian curvature throughout, the usual and plausible conjecture is thatfor every ε > 0, where Θ 2 := 1/2 and Θ s := s -2 for s ≥ 3. It is wellknown that for every dimension, Θ s is the minimal possible value with this property, and that (1.2) is actually true for spheres of dimension s ≥ 4, even with ε = 0 if s ≥ 5: see, e.g., E. Krätzel [15, p. 227].Quite recently, V. Bentkus and F. Götze [1] and F. Götze [3] established (1.2) for arbitrary ellipsoids of dimension s ≥ 5.However, for s = 2 and 3, and for general bodies of higher dimensions, the proof or disproof of (1.2) remains an open problem.The sharpest known",

The resulting formulas allow for the derivation of parametric representations of P , Q, and R, analogous to representations in Ramanujan’s second notebook. In contrast, in the classical approach, one first needs to derive the fundamental formula connecting theta functions with elliptic integrals. This theorem is not needed in the present approach.",

In contrast, very few precise results exist for the discrepancy of subsequences $\\{n_k \\alpha\\}$, with the exception of metric results for exponentially growing $(n_k)$. It is therefore natural to consider random $(n_k)$, and in this paper we give nearly optimal bounds for the discrepancy of $\\{n_k \\alpha\\}$ in the case when the gaps $n_{k+1}-n_k$ are independent, identically distributed, integer-valued random variables. As we will see, the discrepancy behavior is determined by a delicate interplay between the distribution of the gaps $n_{k+1}-n_k$ and the rational approximation properties of $\\alpha$. We also point out an interesting critical phenomenon, a sudden change of the order of magnitude of the discrepancy of $\\{n_k \\alpha\\}$ as the Diophantine type of $\\alpha$ passes through a certain critical value.",

Introduction.The search for the most probable difference among consecutive primes has been conducted for a long time.The problem was proposed by H. Nelson [N1, N2] in the 1977-78 volume of the Journal of Recreational Mathematics.Assuming the prime pair conjecture of G. H. Hardy and J. E. Littlewood [HL], P. Erdős and E. G. Straus [ES] showed in 1980 that there is no most likely difference, since they found that the most likely difference grows as the number considered becomes larger.J. H. Conway invented the term \"jumping champion\" to refer to the most common gap between consecutive primes not exceeding x.Let p n denote the nth prime.The jumping champions are the integers d for which the counting function N (x, d) = pn≤x pn-p n-1 =d 1 attains its maximum N * (x) = max d N (x, d).In 1999 Odlyzko, Rubinstein and Wolf [ORW] formulated the following two hypotheses:Conjecture 1.1.The jumping champions greater than 1 are 4 and the primorials 2, 6, 30, 210, 2310, . . . .Conjecture 1.2.The jumping champions tend to infinity.Furthermore, any fixed prime p divides all sufficiently large jumping champions.Conjecture 1.1 is now known as the Jumping Champion Conjecture.It is obvious that Conjecture 1.2 is a weaker consequence of Conjecture 1.1, and as already mentioned, the first assertion of Conjecture 1.2 was proved",

Schur a démontré que pour n ≥ 4, H 2 (S n , {±1}) est bicyclique d'ordre 4. Il existe donc à isomorphisme près trois extensions centrales non triviales de S n par {±1}.Dans ce travail, nous considérons l'extension S n de S n notée II dans [Sc], p. 164 et décrite dans [Se1], p. 654, en nous limitant au cas n = 4. Dans S n , toute transposition de S n est relevée en un élément d'ordre 2 et tout produit de deux transpositions à supports disjoints est relevé en un élément d'ordre 4. Ajoutons que l'on peut donner une interprétation géométrique de l'extension S 4 de S 4 , S 4 étant isomorphe à PGL 2L'étude décrite dans cette note s'inspire de l'article de C. Bachoc et S.-H.Kwon sur le groupe A 4 (voir [B-K]), qui admet une unique extension centrale non triviale par {±1}, laquelle a une réalisation dans le groupe des quaternions usuels de norme 1 : {±1, ±i, ±j, ±k, (±1 ± i ± j ± k)/2}.Ce travail considère le cas où k 0 = Q et où G est isomorphe à S 4 .La première partie décrit les extensions à groupe de Galois S 4 et en étudie les ramifications.La seconde utilise un théorème de Serre ([Se1]) -qui permet de lier la possibilité de plonger N/k 0 dans une extension N /k 0 de groupe de Galois G à la valeur de l'invariant de Witt de la forme quadratique Tr K/k 0 (x 2 ) -pour donner une condition suffisante de plongement portant sur les ramifications de nombres premiers dans l'extension N/Q.Dans une troisième partie, nous considérons le cas où N/Q est plongeable et cherchons à réaliser le plongement en minimisant le nombre de places ramifiées.La quatrième partie discute ensuite l'existence d'une classe au sens restreint d'ordre 2 dans la clôture galoisienne N de toute extension [259]",

They then use an “automatic” proof to show that the Laurent series of F (X), defined over Q, is normal.

We shall also consider the continued fraction of the more general surd 1/ √ 1 + u/X + v/X2 over any field not of characteristic 2.

The Erdős–Turan theorem was generalized independently to T by Koksma [9] and Szusz [13]. They took F to be the family of boxes with sides parallel to the axes (see also [3] and [6], §5.4). It is possible to prove an analogue when F is the family of all boxes. As is well known, allowing the boxes to be “tilted” greatly increases the discrepancy in general (see [6], §5.4, [2] and [10]). In [7] Holt has given an Erdős–Turan inequality for balls. This was based on an approximation to the characteristic function of a ball which is in some sense optimal [8]. It is the purpose of this note to prove a stronger version of this result. It may seem paradoxical that we will not employ the “optimal” functions used by Holt. We will explain below the difference between Holt’s work and our own. Suffice it to say now that his approach optimized the analogue of C1 above, but gave the wrong size coefficients in the analogue",

He also proved that if the Riemann Hypothesis is assumed then (1) holds for λ < 1/4. In 1983 Balog [1] and Harman [8] used Vaughan’s identity and mean value estimates for Dirichlet polynomials and independently proved without assuming the Riemann Hypothesis that the formula (1) is true for λ < 1/4. Later Balog [2] generalized his result to prime numbers in arithmetic progressions. We should also mention the works of Schoissengeier [14], [15], Gritsenko [7] and Rivat [13]. In the present paper we use the method of Balog and Harman and we prove a theorem of Bombieri–Vinogradov type for prime numbers from the set Sλ. Let λ, θ be real numbers such that",

    "abstract": "We present an algorithm for computing Gauss sums over Fq for large prime powers q. This allows us to find the exact values of Gauss sums in many previously intractable cases. The efficient computation of such Gauss sums up to multiplication with a root of unity is achieved by using Stickelberger’s factorization of Gauss sums, an application of the Fincke-Pohst algorithm, and fast arithmetic for subfields of cyclotomic fields. This still leaves the crucial problem of resolving the root of unity ambiguity, which we settle by recursively computing “H-polynomials”. These are integer polynomials which interpolate Gauss sums at certain roots of unity. As an application, we compute the weight distribution of all binary irreducible cyclic codes of length n and dimension k with 2 k−1 n ≤ 5, 000. 2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: 11T24 (primary), 11Y40 (secondary)",

    "abstract": "Characterization of the torsion of the Jacobian of y 2 = x 5 + Ax and some applications by Tomasz Jędrzejak (Szczecin) and Maciej Ulas (Warszawa and Kraków) 1. Introduction.In [7] it is shown that for any quadruple of pairwise distinct elliptic curves E i , i = 1, 2, 3, 4, with j-invariant j = 0 there exists a polynomial D ∈ Z[u] such that the sextic twists of E i , i = 1, 2, 3, 4, by D(u) have positive ranks.A similar result was proved for quadruples of elliptic curves with j-invariant equal to 1728.These results have been generalized in [4] to curves of the form y 2 = x n + A, where n is divisible by an odd prime and A ∈ Z \\ {0}.The main tool in the proof was a (partial) characterization of possible torsion subgroups of the Jacobian variety associated with the curve y 2 = x p + A, where p is an odd prime and A ∈ Z \\ {0}.A natural question arises whether similar results could be obtained for ktuples (for appropriate k) of hyperelliptic curves of the form C : y 2 = x 5 +Ax (of genus 2), which are (in some sense) natural generalizations of elliptic curves with j-invariant equal to 1728.The quartic twist of the curve C by D has the form C D : y 2 = x 5 + AD 2 x.The octic twist of C by D is C D : y 2 = x 5 + ADx.In view of the results obtained in [7] and [4] we ask the following question.Question 1.1.Let C i : y 2 = x 5 +a i x where a i ∈ Z\\{0} for i = 1, . . ., n, and suppose that C i = C j for i = j.What is the maximal number, say N , for which there exists a polynomial D ∈ Z[u] such that the Jacobian of the octic twist of C i by D has positive rank for all i = 1, . . ., N ?This is a difficult problem and we only give a lower bound on N .It is clear that to this end we need two things.We must be able to construct rational points on appropriate curves and show that these points lead to 2010",

We assume throughout the paper that d1 and d2 are fixed and that L/M has a given ratio. Put k = gcd(L,M), l = L/k and m = M/k. Hence l and m are fixed and gcd(l,m) = 1. There are several results in the literature in case d1 = d2 = 1. In 1963 Mordell [6] proved that (1) with (L,M) = (2, 3) implies that (x, y) = (2, 1) or (14, 5). MacLeod and Barrodale [5] showed in 1970 that (1) has no solutions if (L,M) = (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 12), (4, 8) or (5, 10) and admits only the solution (x, y) = (8, 1) if (L,M) = (3, 6). Two years later Boyd and Kisilevsky [1] proved that (x, y) = (2, 1), (4, 2), (55, 19) are the only solutions of (1) if (L,M) = (3, 4). For fixed L and M = 2L, MacLeod and Barrodale further showed that (1) admits only finitely many solutions. In 1990 Saradha and Shorey [8] proved that there exists only one solution with M = 2L, namely (L,M, x, y) = (3, 6, 8, 1). In 1991 they showed in [9] that (1) has no solutions with M = 3L or M = 4L. Recently, Mignotte and Shorey showed that this is also the case when M = 5L or M = 6L. In general, for m > 1 and M = mL, Saradha and Shorey [10] proved that equation (1) implies that max(L, x, y) is bounded by an effectively computable number depending only on m. In 1992 Saradha and Shorey [11] started the study of equation (1) for more general pairs (d1, d2). They showed that if d1 = d2 = d and l = 1, m > 1 then there exists an effectively computable upper bound for k = L, x and y which depends only on d and m. Later, Saradha and Shorey [12] showed",

    "abstract": "(1) sk = { vk if k ≤ n , ∑n−1 i=0 aisk−n+i if k > n , consists of all nonzero elements of V for k = 1, . . . , p − 1. Such generating patterns are of interest because they provide simple algorithms for generating the linear span of independent subsets of vector spaces over Fp (see [1] for details). In this paper we generalize a number of the results from [1] by working over Fq where Fq is the finite field of order q and by showing that if a0 6= 0, (a0, . . . , an−1) is an n-dimensional generating pattern over Fq if and only if f(x) = x − ∑n−1 i=0 aix i is a primitive polynomial over Fq. More generally, we show that the number of distinct elements generated by a linear recurring sequence is related to the order of its characteristic polynomial. For q = p < 10 with p ≤ 97, we indicate when one can find an optimal n-dimensional generating pattern over Fp with weight two, i.e. with two nonzero ai’s (in [1] the length is defined to be the number of nonzero ai’s but a more natural term is Hamming weight). If V is an n-dimensional vector space over Fq then V is isomorphic to Fqn as a vector space over Fq. Consequently, instead of considering vectors in V as in [1], we may assume that the elements of the sequence are in Fqn . We will make this identification throughout the remainder of the paper.",

We deal with the problem of finding from the decimal expansion of x, the first k (where k is a given integer) partial quotients of the regular continued fraction expansion of x.

We assume that the integer n is such that the numbers xn and yn have finite continued fraction expansions which coincide up to order k, i.e., xn = [α0;α1, . . . , αk, . . .] and yn = [α0;α1, . . . , αk, . . .] for some integers αi. Since the set of numbers which have a continued fraction which begins with α0, . . . , αk is an interval, it follows that x = [α0;α1, . . . , αk, . . .], in other words α0, α1, . . . , αk are precisely the first k partial quotients of x.

    "abstract": "In their article [S-T], Roel J. Stroeker and Jaap Top considered elliptic curves over Q defined by the equation Ep : y2 = (x+ p)(x2 + p2), where p ∈ P is a prime number. They determined the Selmer groups corresponding to certain 2-isogenies and the sign of the functional equation of these curves. Moreover, they gave a method for computing the Mordell–Weil group Ep(Q) in some cases. The aim of this note is to generalize their method to curves over Q defined by the equation Ez : y2 = (x+ z)(x2 + z2) with arbitrary z ∈ Q∗. Whereas the methods are analogous to those of R. J. Stroeker and J. Top, the results obtained here are quite different. We shall develop an algorithm for computing the Selmer groups corresponding to 2-isogenies of these curves. This algorithm is based on four theorems, which constitute the main results of Section 2 and describe the Selmer groups of these curves. We also generalize the procedure for finding generators of the Mordell–Weil groups of these curves. This procedure terminates if the Tate–Shafarevich groups are trivial, which is certainly not so in general. Stroeker and Top were able to prove that the Tate–Shafarevich group is nontrivial in a special case of a prime k = p ≡ 9 mod 16 and ( 1+ √−1 p ) = 1 (see [S-T]), but I could not generalize their method.",

Introduction.The well known \"H conjecture\" (see [HaR]) states that n 2 + 1 is prime infinitely often.This is equivalent to the existence of infinitely many primes p satisfying {p 1/2 } < p -1/2 .The current methods of analytic number theory are far from being sufficient to prove these conjectures.However, Kubilius [Kub] and Ankeny [Ank] proved already about fifty years ago, assuming the truth of the Riemann Hypothesis for Hecke Lfunctions with Größencharacters over Q(i), that p = n 2 + m 2 is infinitely often prime with m log p.This implies that {p 1/2 } < p -1/2+ε for infinitely many primes p.Of course, this is only a conditional result.As demonstrated in [Ba1, 2], [Ha1, 2] and [BaH], it is also possible to obtain some unconditional non-trivial results on small fractional parts of p 1/2 , or more generally, on small fractional parts of p λ , λ being a fixed real number lying in the interval (0, 1).In particular, for λ = 1/2 Balog and Harman obtained {p 1/2 } < p -1/4+ε for infinitely many primes p.This result has recently been beaten.Combining Kubilius's ideas with efficient sieve methods, Harman and Lewis [HaL] unconditionally showed that the exponent 1/4 may be replaced by 0.262.However, their method works only for λ = 1/2, whereas the methods in [Ba1, 2], [Ha1, 2] and [BaH] are applicable to all λ in certain subintervals of (0, 1).In the present paper, we focus our interest mainly on small exponents λ.Our starting point is the following result of Harman (Theorem 4 in [Ha2]).Theorem 1. Suppose that ε > 0, B > 0 and λ ∈ (0, 1/5] are given.Let N ≥ 3.For every positive integer k define",

(Replacing the lim in the definition of density by lim sup or lim inf, one obtains the notions of upper density and lower density, respectively. Note that the family of sets having positive lower density is closed under supersets, which is a desired feature of any notion of “largeness.” Indeed, positive lower density is the first of several progressively stronger “largeness” properties that we shall be concerned with in this paper.) A set S in Z is syndetic if the union of finitely many of its additive shifts is all of Z. Alternatively, S is syndetic if it intersects non-trivially any large enough d-dimensional cube; namely, if there exists k such that for all choices of M1, . . . ,Md, S ∩ ∏d i=1[Mi,Mi + k] 6= ∅. In Z, then, S is syndetic if it intersects non-trivially any large enough interval, i.e. has bounded gaps. Syndeticity is a property that is strictly stronger than that of positive lower density and is the second notion of largeness of interest to us.

Yoshida ([Yo(80), p. 243]) proposed a twodimensional analog of the famous Shimura-Taniyama relation between Hasse zeta functions of elliptic curves over the field of rational numbers and Hecke zeta functions of elliptic modular forms.To confirm the Yoshida conjecture, R. Salvati-Manni and J. Top have considered in [SM-T(93)] a number of products of four Igusa theta constants with rational characteristics which (in part hypothetically) are eigenfunctions of all regular Hecke operators with Andrianov zeta function coinciding (up to a finite number of Euler factors) with the Hasse zeta function of an appropriate two-dimensional Abelian variety.In this paper we begin to study the transformation properties of products of an even number of Igusa theta constants with rational characteristics considered as Siegel modular forms.More specifically, we investigate their transformations under modular substitutions and under the action of regular Hecke operators.For this we interpret products of theta constants as multiple theta functions of sums of squares and then apply explicit transformation formulas for the action of modular substitutions and regular Hecke operators on theta functions of integral quadratic forms (obtained in [An(95)] and [An(96)], respectively).In particular, if the class number of the sum of 2k squares is equal to one, we obtain explicit transformation formulas expressing images of the products of 2k theta constants with rational characteristics under the action of regular Hecke operators in the form of linear combinations of similar products (Theorem 4.1).",

Introduction.A smooth projective curve X defined over an algebraically closed field k is called d-gonal if it admits a map φ : X → P 1 over k of degree d.If the genus g ≥ 2 and d = 2 then X is called hyperelliptic.We will say that X is trigonal, tetragonal and pentagonal for d = 3, d = 4 and d = 5 respectively.Let N be a positive integer, and letLet X 0 (N ) denote the modular curve corresponding to Γ 0 (N ).Then Zograf [Z] gave a linear bound on the level N of d-gonal modular curves X 0 (N ).Also Nguyen and Saito [N-Sa] proved an analogue of the strong Uniform Boundedness Conjecture for elliptic curves defined over function fields of dimension one by using the connection with giving a bound on the level N of d-gonal modular curves X 0 (N ).Recently, Hasegawa and Shimura [H-S] gave a highly sharpened upper bound for 3 ≤ d ≤ 5 by trying to determine d-gonal modular curves X 0 (N ) for such d.For d = 2 it was done by Ogg [O].Actually Hasegawa and Shimura succeeded in determining all trigonal modular curves X 0 (N ) but failed for tetragonal and pentagonal X 0 (N ).The following lists N for which they did not know whether X 0 (N ) was tetragonal or not: 76, 82, 84, 88, 90, 93, 97",

The skew product $f_\\a: \\T^2 \\times \\C \\to \\T^2 \\times \\C$ given by $f_\\theta(x,y,z)=(T_\\theta(x,y),z+e^{2 \\pi i y})$ generates the so called Weyl sums cocycle $a_\\a(x,n) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} e^{2\\pi i(k^2\\theta+kx)}$ since the $n^{{\\rm th}}$ iterate of $f_\\a$ writes as $f_\\a^n(x,y,z)=(T_\\a^n(x,y),z+e^{2\\pi iy} a_\\a(2x,n))$.

    "abstract": "On determination of GL 3 cusp forms by Qingfeng Sun (Weihai) 1. Introduction.In 1997, Luo and Ramakrishnan [LR] studied to what extent modular forms can be characterized by central values of twisted Lfunctions and their derivatives.Since then, this subject has been studied by many authors for various modular forms (see Luo [L] and Ganguly, Hoffstein and Sengupta [GHS]).The determination of GL 3 cusp forms by central values of twisted L-functions was first studied by Chinta and Diaconu [CD] as a generalization of the results in [LR].Recently, Liu [Liu] studied the question of determining a GL 3 self-dual Hecke-Maass cusp form by central values of its GL 2 twisted L-functions.Precisely, let f be a fixed self-dual Hecke-Maass cusp form for SL 3 (Z) and let A(m, n) denote its (m, n)th Fourier coefficient.Liu proved that f is uniquely determined by the family {L(1/2, f × g) : g ∈ H k }, where H k is an orthogonal basis of holomorphic cusp forms of weight k ≡ 0 (mod 4) for SL 2 (Z).In this paper, we will show that f is also uniquely determined by the family {L (1/2, f × g) : g ∈ B k }, where B k is an orthogonal basis of holomorphic cusp forms of weight k ≡ 2 (mod 4) for SL 2 (Z).Theorem 1.1.Let f and f be fixed self-dual Hecke-Maass cusp forms for SL 3 (Z).Let c = 0 be a constant.IfAs in [Liu], we will prove Theorem 1.1 by establishing an asymptotic formula for the first twisted moment of L (s, f × g) at s = 1/2, where g runs over B k .Let λ g (n) be the normalized nth Fourier coefficient of g ∈ B k and ω g = k -1 2π 2 L(1, sym 2 g), where L(s, sym 2 g) is the symmetric-square L-function associated to g.",

In analogy with the classical case of special values at 0, we give an algebraic proof of this formula, i.e. without using the Lichtenbaum conjecture nor Brauer formalism.

L'argument heuristique suivant constitue la motivation initiale d'Erdős concernant (1.1).Lorsque n et m sont premiers entre eux (hypothèse faite seulement pour simplifier cette argumentation) on sait que le nombre des paires {d, t} telles que d | n, t | m et t ≤ 2n peut être minoré par U n,m = 2 ω(n) 2 ω(m,n) , où ω(m, n) := p|m p≤n",

Later on, the existence of many expansions of the type (1) could be explained by putting them into the context of harmonic analysis by which the consideration was restricted to almost even arithmetical functions g having, at least in general, a nonzero asymptotic mean value (see, for example, Wintner [22], Cohen [2], Schwarz and Spilker [18], Knopfmacher [9]).

However, this proof is non-effective and does not give any bounds for the size of the possible solutions. In 1968, A. Baker could give effective bounds based on his famous theory on linear forms in logarithms of algebraic numbers. In the last decades, this method was refined (see for instance Baker and Wustholz [1] and Waldschmidt [29]). Recent explicit upper bounds for the solutions of Thue equations have been given by Bugeaud and Győry [3]. Algorithms for the solution of a single Thue equation have been developed by several authors (see Bilu and Hanrot [2]). E. Thomas [25] was the first to deal with a parametrized family of Thue equations; since then, some families have been investigated: cubic families have been discussed by Mignotte [16], Lee [12], and Mignotte and Tzanakis [19], a cubic inequality has been solved by Mignotte, Pethő, and Lemmermeyer [17]; quartic families have been considered by Pethő [20], Mignotte, Pethő, and Roth [18], Lettl and Pethő [13], Chen and Voutier [4], and Heuberger, Pethő, and Tichy [10]; Wakabayashi [28] dealt with a quartic inequality, Pethő and Tichy [21] solved a two-parametric quartic family, quintic families have been investigated by Heuberger [9] and Gaal and Lettl [6], a sextic family has been solved by Lettl, Pethő, and Voutier [14, 15]; see",

The 2-class group. Let h(m) and h, respectively, and put h -(m) = h(m)/h + (m).In this section we will show how the results on the 2-class field tower of quadratic number fields can be used to improve the results of Stevenhagen [30] on the parity of h + (m) for certain composite m with few prime factors.Proposition 4. Let p ≡ q ≡ 1 mod 4 be primes, put L = Q(ζ pq ), and let K and K + be the maximal 2-extensions contained in L and3. if (p/q) 4 = (q/p) 4 = +1, then 4 | h(K + ).P r o o f.By a result of Rédei and Reichardt [23,24], the quadratic number field k = Q( √ pq ) admits a cyclic quartic extension F/k which is unramified outside ∞ and which is normal over Q with Gal(F/Q) D 4 , the dihedral group of order 8.The last property guarantees that F is either totally real or totally complex; Scholz [26] has shown that F is real if and only if (p/q) 4 = (q/p) 4 .Assume that F is real; then, for every subfield M of K + containing Q( √ pq ), the extension F K + /K + is unramified everywhere and is cyclic of degree 2 (if Q( √ p, √ q ) ⊆ M ) or 4 (otherwise); by Hilbert's theorem 94 this implies that the class number of M is even.If F is totally complex, we consider the field K + .In this case, K and F K + are totally complex quadratic extensions of K + which are unramified",

In particular, if n 4, we show there exists a unique range set with n elements for the family of non-constant one variable polynomials in any characteristic. As far as a pure existence theorem goes, this is the best one can hope for, as there are no 3 point unique range sets in characteristic three. For all prime powers q = p n 3, we construct an anely rigid set of q elements which is not a unique range set for the non-constant one variable polynomials in characteristic p. All our results hold equally well for the family of non-constant one variable non-Archimedean entire functions.",

    "abstract": "on the occasion of his 75th birthdayIntroduction.There is a hope that further progress in number theory is closely related to study of interaction of various representations of Hecke-Shimura rings (HS-rings) of arithmetical discrete subgroups of Lie groups on suitable spaces of automorphic forms.Important examples of, say, \"vertical\" interaction are given by lifts of automorphic structures to similar groups of higher orders (see, e.g., [An01]).Not less, if not more, interesting are cases of \"horizontal\" interaction arising from consideration of HS-rings of different Lie groups, say, symplectic and orthogonal (see, e.g., [An06]).In general, an automorphic structure on a Lie group is a HS-ring of an arithmetical discrete subgroup of the group together with a linear representation of the ring on a space of automorphic forms by Hecke operators.An interaction mapping from one automorphic structure to an automorphic structure on another group is a mapping of HS-rings of the discrete subgroups compatible with the action of the corresponding Hecke operators on suitable spaces of automorphic forms.In this paper we construct interaction mappings for HS-rings of certain subgroups of integral symplectic groups and groups of units of integral nonsingular quadratic forms in an even number of variables.For the action of Hecke operators on theta-functions see, e.g., [An90], [An92], and [An09].Notation.We fix the letters Z, Q, R, and C for the ring of rational integers, the field of rational numbers, the field of real numbers, and the field of complex numbers, respectively.",

Introduction.L'algorithme du développement en fraction continue d'un réel vérifie deux propriétés fondamentales, l'unimodularité (p n q n+1p n+1 q n = ±1), et la propriété de meilleure approximation diophantienne (cf.définition 1).En dimension supérieure ou égale à 2, il n'y a pas d'algorithme aussi satisfaisant car la suite des meilleures approximations dépend de la norme choisie ([L1]) et elle ne vérifie pas la propriété d'unimodularité ([L3]).Plusieurs approches sont possibles pour remplacer le développement en fraction continue en dimension supérieure à 2. On peut soit privilégier l'aspect algorithmique et l'unimodularité, soit étudier la suite des meilleures approximations sans chercher à la calculer explicitement.Beaucoup de travaux sont consacrés à la première approche.La seconde a été moins explorée.J. C. Lagarias est le premier à avoir étudié la suite des meilleures approximations pour elle-même ([L1]-[L3]). Citons aussi le travail de G. Szekeres et V. T. Sós ([Sz-Só]) et ajoutons que J. W. S. Cassels dans [Ca] introduit le développement en fraction continue au moyen de la suite des meilleures approximations.Nous avons adopté ce point de vue; nous rappelons des résultats de J. C. Lagarias et nous généralisons au tore T 2 les deux résultats classiques suivants :1. Pour tout Θ ∈ T 1 et n ∈ N, q n+1 q n Θ ≥ 1/2, où (q n ) désigne la suite des dénominateurs des réduites de Θ.2. L'ensemble des Θ ∈ T 1 dont les coefficients du développement en fraction continue forment une suite bornée, est négligeable pour la mesure de Lebesgue.",

The major aim of our investigation is in exhibiting the relationship between the number of elements in a given set of positive integers not exceeding n and the number of integers that can always be chosen (with or without the restriction that these should lie in the given set) so that their sums (or products), taken two at a time, should all lie in the given set. We shall only once consider the analogous question relating to sums formed with a variable number of summands . Notation. The letters c„ c 2f . . . denote positive absolute constants, unless otherwise indicated. A sum or product in this paper will mean, unless otherwise indicated, one formed with distinct integers . A sequence will always mean a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers .",

Introduction.Let G be an abelian group of order k.Given a sequence of elements a 1 , . . ., a n in G (possibly with repetitions), a t-sum is a sum of the form a i 1 + . . .+ a i t (i 1 < . . .< i t ).In [6] Erdős, Ginzburg and Ziv proved an important result in Combinatorial Number Theory, which states that if n = 2k -1 then some k-sum is 0. Since then, numerous other proofs and generalizations of this result have been given (see for example [2] and the survey paper [4]).More recently, Bollobás and Leader [3] proved the following interesting result: for n = k + r (1 ≤ r ≤ k -1), if 0 is not a k-sum then there are at least r + 1 k-sums.This clearly implies the Erdős-Ginzburg-Ziv theorem, by taking r = k -1.In this paper we shall prove several results concerning k-sums for abelian groups of order k.Our first result here is the following theorem, which settles a conjecture of Bollobás and Leader (see [3, Section 2]).",

This work is published in Acta Arithmetica 132.4 (2008). Let p be an odd prime number, q a power of p and Fq the finite field with cardinality q. Let T be an indeterminate and K = Fq(T ) the rational function field. Let l be an odd prime number. Friesen [3], Cardon and Murty [1], respectively, proved that there are infinitely many real and imaginary, respectively, quadratic extensions F over K such that the class number of F is divisible by l. In [6], Kimura proved that there are infinitely many quadratic extensions F over K such that the class number of F is not divisible by 3. For an odd prime number l, Ichimura [5] constructed infinitely many imaginary quadratic extensions F over K such that the class number of F is not divisible by l, when the order of q mod l in the multiplicative group (Z/lZ)∗ is odd or l = p. In this talk, we shall show the following theorem. Theorem 0.1 Let l be an odd prime number. Then there are infinitely many imaginary quadratic extensions F over K such that the class number of F is not divisible by l. Theorem 0.1 is a function field analogue of Hartung’s work [4] on the imaginary quadratic number fields. To prove this theorem, following Hartung’s",

The second proof uses the residue of the Eisenstein series E∗ R for explicit computation of the volume. This method was already used in [Sa]. We draw the relevant Fourier expansion and the residue of the Eisenstein series from [GS]. It was kindly pointed out to the authors by F. Grunewald (Dusseldorf) that our volume formula can also be proved with some labour by the usual Tamagawa measure method. But in analogously defined cocompact situations the evaluation of the volume formula by this method seems still very complicated due to our lack of knowledge of certain Cartan involutions.",

Alors θ est dit K-nombre de Pisot (resp.de Salem) si pour tout plongement σ de K dans C le polynôme σP possède une unique racine de module > 1 et aucune (resp.au moins une) racine de module 1. Ces nombres ont été définis par A. M. Bergé et J. Martinet [1] et ont été étudiés par M. J. Bertin qui a considéré le cas où K est un corps quadratique réel [2].On considère ici deux cas : où K est un corps quadratique imaginaire et où K est un corps cubique totalement réel.Le but est de déterminer des polynômes réciproques de petite mesure.On commence par déterminer les K-nombres de Pisot de petite mesure dans ces deux cas.Ces résultats sont présentés dans le théorème 2, où on détermine tous les K-nombres de Pisot non réels de mesure < 2 dans le cas où K est quadratique imaginaire, et dans le théorème 4, où on détermine tous les K-nombres de Pisot qui ne sont pas des Q-nombres de Pisot, de mesure < 4, où K est un corps cubique totalement réel.La preuve du théorème 2 est basée sur les transformées de Schur et celle du théorème 4 sur l'algorithme de Schur généralisé [2].Ensuite, en utilisant la construction de Salem, on détermine des K-nombres de Salem de petite mesure pour ces deux cas.Dans le cas quadratique imaginaire en appliquant la construction de Salem aux K-nombres de Pisot du théorème 2 on trouve des K-nombres de Salem non réels de mesure < 1.69, et dans le cas cubique totalement réel en appliquant cette construction aux K-nombres de Pisot du théorème 4 on trouve un seul K-nombre de Salem de mesure < 3, les autres polynômes ont 1 ou 2 conjugués hors du disque unité.Les calculs sont faits grâce au système Pari [9].

    "abstract": "Introduction. Let E/F be a totally real quadratic extension of a totally real algebraic number field. To a suitably defined automorphic form h defined with respect to a quaternion algebra BE over E, we can associate a Hilbert modular form I(z, h) defined with respect to the field F . Such a lifting has been explicitly considered in the author’s recent paper [D99], via a convolution with a theta function, and the Fourier coefficients of the theta lift have been computed in terms of certain periods of the original form. The purpose of the current paper is to establish an explicit formula relating the actions of the Hecke operators on the original automorphic form and its theta lift. This result is analogous to theorems of Shimura in, for example, [Sh82] and [Sh88], where he has shown commutativity properties with respect to these Hecke operators. In addition to their inherent interest, these commutativity results are necessary in obtaining algebraicity results concerning Shimura’s period invariants as well as certain special L-values which naturally arise. The reader can consult Shimura’s [Sh88] for further motivation in this regard. See also [Y]. It is the author’s hope to discuss applications in this direction in the near future. Since it is essential for our purposes to consider everything explicitly, the quantity of technical details is considerable. In the interest of space, and also in order not to obscure essential ideas, a large amount of computation has been suppressed. Instead we have endeavored to point out key ingredients in the computations and to give precise references. It is then hoped that",

    "abstract": "Let us consider a linear equation (∗) a1x1 + . . .+ akxk = b, where a1, . . . , ak, b ∈ Z. We call the equation (∗) invariant if both s = a1 + . . .+ ak = 0 and b = 0, and noninvariant otherwise. We say that a set A is (∗)-free if it contains no nontrivial solution to (∗) and define r(n) as the size of the largest (∗)-free set contained in [n] = {1, . . . , n}. The behavior of r(n) has been extensively studied for many cases of invariant linear equations. The two best known examples are the equation x + y = 2z, when r(n) is the size of the largest set without arithmetic progression of length three contained in [n] (see [6]), and the equation x1 + x2 = y1 + y2, when r(n) becomes the size of the largest Sidon subset of [n] (see [3], [7], [8]). Much less is known about the behavior of r(n) for noninvariant linear equations, maybe apart from sum-free sets (see for example [1], [2], [5], [10]). The main contribution to this subject was made by Ruzsa [9] who studied properties of sets without solutions to a fixed noninvariant linear equation. Following his paper let us define Λ(∗) = sup{d(A) : A ⊆ N, A is (∗)-free}, Λ(∗) = sup{d(A) : A ⊆ N, A is (∗)-free}, λ(∗) = lim sup n→∞ r(n)/n,",

Let SF (G) the sel of all sum-free subets of G and σ(G) deonotes the number n(log 2 |SF (G)|). In this article we shall improve the error term in asymptotic formula of σ(G) obtained in [GR05]. The methods used are a slight refinement of methods of [GR05]. Let G be a finite abelian group of order n. A subset A of G is said to be sum-free if there is no solution of the equation x+ y = z, with x, y, z belonging to the set A. Let SF (G) denotes the set of all sum-free subsets of G. This article is motivated by the question of studying the cardinality of the set SF (G). Definition: (I) Let μ(G) denotes the density of a largest sum-free subset of G, so that any such subset has size μ(G)n. (II) Given a set B ⊂ G we say that (x, y, z) ∈ B3 is a Schur triple of the set B if x+ y = z. Observing that all subsets of a sum-free set are sum-free we have the obvious inequality |SF (G)| ≥ 2 (1) Let the symbol σ(G) denotes the number n(log2 |SF (G)|). Then from (1) it follows trivially that σ(G) ≥ μ(G). In this article we improve the results of Ben Green and Imre Ruzsa [GR05] and prove the following two results. The theorem 1 follows immediately from theorem 2 and a result from [GR05], namely theorem 6. The methods used to prove theorem 2 are a slight refinements of methods in [GR05].",

Here, for each CM-field K, µ - K and λ - K denote respectively the Iwasawa µ --and λ --invariants associated with the basic Z 2 -extension over K, Z 2 being of course the additive group of the 2-adic integer ring.An additional remark will be made in the last section.Part of the notation used in the paper is as follows.For any number field F , we let C F denote the ideal class group of F , A F the Sylow 2-subgroup of C F , and h F the class number of F ; h F = |C F |.Moreover, h * F will denote the class number of F in the narrow sense, F + the maximal real subfield of F , I F the ideal group of F , E F the unit group of F , E * F the subgroup of E F consisting of all totally positive elements of F in E F , and N F/H , for each subfield H of F , the norm map from the multiplicative group F × = F \\ {0} to the multiplicative group H × .Given arbitrary algebraic numbers α 1 , . . ., α n in C, we write (α 1 , . . ., α n ) for the fractional ideal of Q(α 1 , . . ., α n ) generated by α 1 , . . ., α n .It is therefore understood that (α 1 , . . ., α n ) lies in I F whenever the number field F contains α 1 , . . ., α n .Now, let K be any CM-field.We then denote by A - K the Sylow 2-subgroup of the kernel of the norm mapAs is well known, the norm map C K → C K + is surjective so that h - K equals the order of the kernel of this norm map.We let t K denote the number of prime ideals of K ramified for K/K + .The rank of each finite abelian group G will be denoted by r(G).",

The argument derives from that of Ritt [2], where it arises in studying factorisation in the ring of exponential polynomials. Let g(x1, . . . , xn) be a polynomial and let q1, . . . , qn be positive integers. One says that a polynomial f(x1, . . . , xn) is primary in x1 if an identity f(x1, . . . , xn) = g(x q1 1 , x2, . . . , xn) entails q1 = 1, and that f(x1, . . . , xn) is primary (thus, in each of its variables) if an identity f(x1, . . . , xn) = g(x1 1 , . . . , x qn n ) entails q1 = · · · = qn = 1. We use the term monomial in x1, . . . , xn for a rational function x a1 1 . . . x an n with integral, but not necessarily nonnegative, exponents. Suppose that a polynomial f in several variables is the product of a monomial and of a polynomial in some monomial z in those variables. In that case, f is effectively just a polynomial in the one variable z; we will refer to it in that way.",

    "abstract": "On two-primary algebraic K-theory of quadratic number rings with focus on K 2 by Marius Crainic (Utrecht) and Paul Arne Østvaer (Oslo) 1. Introduction.This paper deals with the two-primary algebraic Ktheory of quadratic number rings.The problem is to determine the torsion part of these groups.In [14] Quillen proved that the algebraic K-groups of number rings are finitely generated Abelian groups, and Borel calculated their rank in [2].To determine the torsion part of the algebraic K-groups of number rings is a very hard problem.One knows quite a lot about the K 2 -functor, but still it is a highly nontrivial problem to determine the K 2 -groups.A major early contribution to the theory is Tate's work in [16] that gives connections between K 2 and Galois cohomology.In fact p-rank formulas for K 2 of number rings can be quite easily deduced from results in [16].These formulas involve classical number theory like ideal class groups and the number of primes lying above a rational prime.Unfortunately p is in general restricted to be a prime number.The situation is a bit better when it comes to quadratic number rings.In that case there are 4-rank formulas for K 2 given in terms of classical number-theoretic invariants.In this paper we describe a method to determine pieces of the twoprimary part of K 2 of a quadratic number ring.There is a tight connection between the ordinary and the narrow K 2 .This connection will be explained in the calculations.To the authors' knowledge, the latest and most complete calculation of K 2 of quadratic number rings can be found in [12] and [13].We",

Introduction.For each prime p, we denote by v p the p-adic valuation.Let h ≥ 2. The positive integer n is said to be h-power free when 0 ≤ v p (n) ≤ h -1 for every prime p.The symbol ♦ shall represent any positive integer which is an hth power (and this includes the integer 1).If h = 2, it is customary to use the symbol .Let P > 0, Q = 0 be coprime integers such that D = P 2 -4Q = 0. We define the Lucas sequences of the first kind , respectively of the second kind , with parameters (P, Q), denoted by, as follows:(for n ≥ 2).D is called the discriminant of these sequences.We shall henceforth assume that D > 0, hence the sequences (U n ) n≥0 and (V n ) n≥0 are increasing.Noteworthy examples of Lucas sequences are the following:1) P = 1, Q = -1.Then D = 5 and U is the sequence of Fibonacci numbers, while V is the sequence of Lucas numbers.2) P = 2, Q = -1.Then D = 8, U is the sequence of Pell numbers of the first kind and V is the sequence of Pell numbers of the second kind.3) Let a > b ≥ 1 with gcd(a, b) = 1, and let(for all n ≥ 0).Then U, V are Lucas sequences with parameters P = a + b, Q = ab and discriminant D = (ab) 2 .A special case is when a = 2, b = 1, giving U n = 2 n -1, V n = 2 n + 1.",

    "abstract": "Dedekind sums with characters and class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields byKaori Ota (Tokyo)1. Introduction.In [4], we proved the reciprocity law for Dedekind sums with characters by using values at non-positive integers of Barnes's double zeta functions with characters.The reciprocity law (Theorem 1 in Section 2) is of course concerned with the Dedekind sums with characters.But if one is interested in the generalized Bernoulli numbers B * ,χ rather than in the Dedekind sums, then the law shows a different side.It leads us to consider a character as a product of two characters with coprime moduli if possible, and one might say that the law gives us the relation between B * ,χ 1 χ 2 and B * ,χ 1 • B * ,χ 2 , or that the Dedekind sums with characters fill the gap between B * ,χ 1 χ 2 and B * ,From this point of view, we can obtain formulas for class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields, since B 1,χ d for χ d the Kronecker character is the negative of the class number of Q( √ d) when d < -4.More precisely, we prove three propositions (and one corollary).Actually the first two propositions are obtained by using the way of proving the law, and the last one is obtained from the law itself.Proposition 1 gives us a formula for the class number h(d) of Q( √ d) by short character sums partitioned by t.We already have formulas for small values of t (cf.[7, Chap.I, §9.6]), and Proposition 1 gives a general formula.Proposition 2 gives us an expression of B 1,χ 1 χ 2 in terms of short character sums, where χ 1 and χ 2 are of opposite parity.This has been obtained by Szmidt, Urbanowicz and Zagier by using Zagier's identity (cf.[6], [7, Chap.I, §9.7]), and we give a different proof.The Corollary to Proposition 2 is known as the class number formulae of Lerch and Mordell (cf.[2], [3], [7, Chap.I, §9.7]).If we compare the formula for h(td) with that for h(d), it may be possible to derive some interesting results (see Remark 1).The last proposition (Proposition 3) treats the relation between h(d 1 )h(d 2 ) and h( d 1 )h( d 2 ), 2000",

    "abstract": "Dedicated to Professor Takashi Ono on the occasion of his 70th birthday 1. Introduction.Let H be the complex upper half plane and let Γ be a congruence subgroup of SL 2 (Z).Since the group Γ acts on H by linear fractional transformations, we get the modular curve X(Γ ) = Γ \\H * , as the projective closure of smooth affine curve Γ \\H, with genus g Γ .Since g 1,N = 0 only for the eleven cases 1 ≤ N ≤ 10 and N = 12 ([12]) when) where j 1,12 (z) := θ 3 (2z)/θ 3 (6z) for z ∈ H and θ 3 is the classical Jacobi theta series.In this article we will construct in Section 3 some sort of class fields by means of Shimura's ideas for the congruence subgroups Γ (N ), Γ 0 (N ) and Γ 1 (N ).In Section 4 we will generate the ray class field K (12) with conductor 12 of imaginary quadratic fields K by applying standard results of complex multiplication to the modular function j 1,12 (z).In Section 5 by using Chen-Yui's result [1], we shall investigate when the subfield of K (12) generated by j 1,12 (α) is equal to a ray class field K f for a conductor f dividing 12 where α is the quotient of a basis of an O K -ideal (Theorems 20, 21 and 23).Lastly, in Section 6 we will explore an explicit formula for the conjugates of the Hauptmodul N (j 1,12 (α)) permitting the numerical computation of its minimal polynomial.We thank the referee for his valuable comments which enabled us to improve Sections 5 and 6.Throughout the article we adopt the following notations:",

    "abstract": "Class number divisibility of relative quadratic function fields by Yoonjin Lee (Burnaby)Introduction.Determining the class number of a number field or a function field is one of the central problems in number theory since Gauss.It is known that given an integer n, infinitely many number fields and function fields have class number divisible by n (see for example, Nagell [8] for imaginary quadratic number fields, Yamamoto [12] for real quadratic number fields, and Friesen [1] for real quadratic function fields).Recently, Kishi and Miyake [3] presented complete descriptions for quadratic number fields to have their ideal class numbers divisible by 3. In fact, they provided necessary and sufficient conditions for the ideal class numbers of quadratic number fields to be divisible by 3.For the case of quadratic function fields, however, there has been no result concerning necessary and sufficient conditions for the ideal class number divisibility by 3, except for the only necessary conditions for the ideal class number divisibility of real quadratic function fields, for instance, in Friesen's work [1].In this paper, we find complete descriptions for quadratic function fields whose ideal class number is divisible by 3.More importantly, we obtain the results for quadratic extensions of any global function field K, and such quadratic extensions are called relative quadratic extension fields of K. We want to point out that this work is very general in the sense that the base field K is not necessarily a rational function field any more, but it can be any global function field.Furthermore, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the divisor class number of a quadratic function field to be divisible by 3.And we also find necessary conditions for relative quadratic extension fields of K to have their divisor class numbers divisible by 3.1. Preliminaries.We begin with some definitions and notations which will be used throughout the paper.",

We also introduce the flipped 3x+1 function \\widetilde U and prove an analogous result for its trajectories. In the final section, we pose some interesting questions about the iterates of U (and \\widetilde U), prove a couple of simple results about the iterates of U and \\widetilde U, introduce other related functions and propose yet more conjectures and questions about their iterates. It's our hope that the results, conjectures and questions presented here will be not only relevant to the 3n+1 conjecture itself, but also of interest in their own right.",

    "abstract": "For each nonzero rational number r, in [1], we considered the problem of approximating G(r) with partial sums of the series (1.1). In the case that an ≡ 1 and s = 1, we asked how well one can approximate e by the partial sums ∑n `=0 1 `! . J. Sondow [6] conjectured that exactly two of these partial sums are also convergents to the continued fraction of e. Among several results, Sondow and K. Schalm [7], proved that for almost all positive integers n, the partial sum ∑n `=0 1 `! is not a convergent to the continued fraction of e. Thus, the probability of obtaining a convergent to the continued fraction of e upon randomly choosing one of the first n partial sums of the power series of e tends to zero as n → ∞. Knowledge of the continued fraction of e, where a is a nonzero integer, and the best possible diophantine approximation of e, discovered by S. Ramanujan [5] and rediscovered by C. S. Davis [4], enabled the authors to prove in [2] that at most Oa(logM) of the first M convergents to the continued fraction of e are also partial sums of the corresponding power series. In [1], we considered general hypergeometric functions pFp(a1, . . . , ap; b1, . . . , bp; r) and showed that among their first N partial sums, no more than O(logN) are convergents to the continued fraction of pFp(a1, . . . , ap; b1, . . . , bp; r). Observe that this result includes e as a special case and that this particular corollary is a dual of the aforementioned result established in [2]. Moreover, when an is a real Dirichlet character or when {an}, n > 0, are the coefficients of an L-series attached to an elliptic curve without complex multiplication, we proved similar theorems in [1]. Lastly, we remark that in [2], we, in fact, proved Sondow’s conjecture. At the focal point of our study in [1] and in this paper are the following two definitions. For any rational number μ = a/b, with (a, b) = 1, consider the height H(μ) of μ, given by H(μ) = max{|a|, |b|}. For any real number α, and any positive real number δ, denote",

This proof is mainly the content of the Ph.D thesis of one of the authors([1]). We follow the ideas of D. Grant([2]), who gave a proof of a quintic reciprocity law based on the arithmetic of a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2. Our main tools are, like in D. Grant’s paper, the formal group in the origin of the Jacobian of the curve and the theorems of complex multiplication. However, there is a significant jump from the genus 2 to the genus 3 setting. For instance, in order to prove of complementary laws, we have to compute some 7-torsion points of the Jacobian; in our case, this computation become difficult due to the high dimension of the Riemann space involved. Along the proof of the complementary laws we produce some interesting units, similar to the classical elliptic units: they appear as the values on torsion points of some rational functions of the Jacobian.",

Other classical examples of Hurwitzian numbers are th(1/q) or tan(1/q) when q is a nonnegative integer, e2/q when q is odd and many other real numbers determined by means of Bessel functions (see Cabannes [1], Lehmer [4] and Stambul [10]). A recognizable Hurwitzian number whose quasi-period is determined by polynomials of degree ≥ 2 is still unknown. Let h : x 7→ (ax + b)/(cx + d) be a Mobius transformation where a, b, c, d are integers. If x is Hurwitzian, it follows from a theorem of O. Perron ([7], 127–131) that h(x) is also Hurwitzian. Moreover, the nonconstant polynomials in the quasi-periods of x and h(x) have the same degrees (see [10]). Denote by R the set of all irrational real numbers x whose continued fraction expansion has the form",

    "abstract": "Quantitative results of algebraic independence and Baker's method by Mamoru Takeuchi (Mito)1. Introduction.It is well known that the method of A. Baker gives the transcendence of numbers related to exponential functions (see Theorems 2.3 and 2.4 of [2]).The idea of using Baker's method to obtain results of algebraic independence seems due to M. Waldschmidt [18], who makes a hypothesis on the transcendence type of the underlying field.In 1976, G. V. Chudnovsky announced some results of algebraic independence (transcendence degree 2), which was repeated in Chapter 2 of [5].The complete proof of these last results can be seen in [8], where G. Diaz removed the complicated arguments coming from Kummer's theory by using the zero estimate of P. Philippon [13].The result was also obtained by R. Tubbs [17] as a corollary to the general theorem on algebraic groups.G.-L. Chen [4] generalized Chudnovsky's result for exponential families to the case of large transcendence degree.In this paper we shall establish quantitative results of this type in a general setting, by using Ably's method [1], which includes Chen's result.The improvement with respect to [1] comes from the construction of an auxiliary function with derivations.Furthermore if ℘ is a Weierstrass elliptic function with algebraic invariants, and if ℘ has no complex multiplications, we shall show that deg trwhere β is an algebraic number of degree 4 and u is a complex number such that u ∈ Q(β). Notations and definitions.Let G be a commutative algebraic group of dimension d ≥ 1 defined over a number field K. Let G a denote the additive group of complex numbers and G m the multiplicative group of complex numbers.We suppose that G decomposes as G = G d 0 a ×G d 1 m ×G 2 , where d 0 ∈ {0, 1}, d 1 ≥ 0, and G 2 is a commutative algebraic group of dimension d 2 = d -d 0 -d 1 , defined over K and with no linear factor.The group G 2 (C) of complex points of G 2 is a complex Lie group.Let ψ : C → G 2 (C) be an an-2000",

Denote by Z p the ring of p-adic integers, i.e. of those elements x ∈ Q p with |x| p ≤ 1.The unit group of Q p , i.e. the set of x ∈ Q p with |x| p = 1, will be denoted by U p .Let Q p be the algebraic closure of Q p and C p its p-adic completion, which is an algebraically closed complete field with a valuation uniquely extended from Q p .Whereas the questions of transcendence or algebraic independence of elements from Q p or even from C p over Q are rather well investigated, the corresponding question for C p over Q p has been studied in the past only occasionally.For a brief survey on what was published on this topic so far, we refer the reader to our recent paper [3].The main result there gives sufficient conditions for the algebraic independence over Q p of numbers from C p defined by infinite series of the form a k p r k , where (r k ) is a sequence of positive rational numbers and the coefficients a k are p-adic integers.In our present paper, we propose two new such criteria, where the hypotheses on the a k , r k are now slightly stronger.But, on the other hand, we no longer need, as in [3], conditions on determinants involving certain of the coefficients a occurring in the different series under consideration.Both of these criteria have the same appearance, typical in algebraic independence theory: Under appropriate assumptions on functions f 1 , . . ., f l and points α 1 , . . ., α m , the l • m numbers f λ (α µ ) from C p are algebraically independent over Q p .",

    "abstract": "The field descent and class groups of CM -fields by Bernhard Schmidt (Singapore) 1. Introduction.Ideal class groups of algebraic number fields are usually studied in terms of class field theory and Galois cohomology (cf.[3-6, 8, 11, 13, 19, 20]).The p-ranks of class groups are of particular interest since they are fundamental for the algebraic properties of the underlying number field (see [3,8,17]).Lower bounds on p-ranks of class groups are particularly desirable.For example, in view of the celebrated result of Golod and Shafarevich [7], such bounds can be used to show that certain number fields have infinite class field towers.In this paper, we will use a different approach: In order to get class group estimates, we consider certain ideals above ramified prime ideals in CM -fields and show by elementary methods that these ideals are nonprincipal.The main idea of the proof is to show that principal ideals often necessarily have to lie in a quite small subfield of the underlying CM -field.This method of \"field descent\" has already been used successfully by the author for the study of combinatorial problems involving cyclotomic integers [18].Our approach here will give us explicit subgroups of class groups of CM -fields.As a consequence, we will get lower bounds on p-ranks of class groups which are comparable to a bound obtained by Schoof [19, Prop.3.1].Schoof's result is more general, but it seems that our bounds are stronger in some cases.As examples for the application of our bound, we give simple explicit sufficient conditions for cyclotomic fields to have infinite p-class field towers. Preliminaries.In this section, we introduce some notation and state some well known results we need later.Throughout this paper, we use the notation ξ t := exp 2πi/t and write ord m (a) for the multiplicative order of a modulo m.The Euler totient function is denoted by ϕ.The following is a basic lemma on the structure of the group of units of Z/p b Z (see [10]).",

Introduction.Let S = {p 1 , . . ., p m , ∞} be a finite set of places of Q, including the archimedean one.The ring of S-integers is given by Its multiplicative subgroup O *S consists of the S-units, i.e. those elements of O S whose p-adic absolute value equals 1 for all p ∈ S. Given a smooth projective algebraic variety X over Q, and a smooth hypersurface D ⊂ X defined by a form F ∈ Z[x 1 , . . ., x n ], we say that x = (x 1 , . . ., x n ) ∈ X is a (D, S)-integral point, or an S-integral point with respect to D, if F (x) ≡ 0 (mod p) for all p ∈ S. We are interested in the asymptotic behaviour of the counting function-integral points of bounded height in the case where X = P n-1 and F is a quadratic form.Here P is a real parameter that tends to infinity, points in projective space are represented by primitive integral tuples, and B is some n-dimensional hyperrectangle in R n centred at the origin.In this form the problem corresponds to the degree two case of a question raised by Tschinkel [5, Problem 5.6].Before we can give a precise statement of our main result, it is necessary to introduce some notation.We write F for the matrix of F given by F (x) = 1 2 x T Fx, and let M be a real orthogonal matrix that diagonalises F. Accordingly, we choose B such that the edges of M T B are parallel to the coordinate axes.The set Λ shall consist of all primes p such that p | 2 det F but p ∈ S. We let ∆ be the set of all m + 1-tuples δ with entries in {0, 1}, and write p δ = (-1) δ 0 p δ 1 1 • • • p δm m for short.For a given prime p ∈ Λ ∪ S and",

Introduction.Let F be an algebraic number field, O F the ring of integers in F and K 2 the Milnor K-functor.For an odd prime p, results on the p-primary part of tame kernels of number fields can be found inHowever, even for m = 1, we do not know this value in general.In this paper we investigate the p m -rank of the tame kernel K 2 O E for a cyclic extension E/F of number fields of degree n with p n.As applications, for E/Q being a cyclic extension of odd prime order l, we obtain some results on the divisibility of p m -rank K 2 O E that generalize results for l = 3, 5 proved in [Br1], [Zh1] and [Wu].For a cyclotomic field Q(ζ l ), we investigate the divisibility of the orders of K 2 O Q(ζ l ) for l < 2000 and l ≡ 3 (mod 4).We use the following notation, terminology and general facts.F v denotes the completion of F with respect to the valuation v, and µ v is the group of roots of unity in F v .It is well-known that K 2 O F is the kernel of the homomorphism τ : K 2 F → F * v , v running through discrete valuations of F , where τ satisfies τ ({α, β}) = ((α, β) v ) v .Here ( , ) v is the tame symbol, as defined in [Mi].Let E/F be a number field extension.Denote by tr E/F the transfer homomorphism tr E/F : K 2 (E) → K 2 (F ), and by j E/F the natural homomorphism j E/F : K 2 (F ) → K 2 (E) induced by the inclusion F ⊆ E.Let G be a finite group and A a finite abelian group which is a G-module.Let x ∈ A. The stabilizer of x is denoted by G x and the G-orbit of x by Gx, that is,For H a subgroup of G we set N H = h∈H h ∈ Z [G].Let E/F be a Galois extension with Galois group G = Gal(E/F ).Then we write N G = N E/F .",

Introduction.Let A be an infinite set of nonnegative integers.By squaring the infinite series f (z) := i∈A z i with 0, 1 coefficients, we obtainwhere R(A, n) is the number of representations of n in the form n = a 1 + a 2 with a 1 , a 2 ∈ A. An old conjecture of Erdős and Turán [6] asserts that for any such infinite set A and any nonnegative integer n 0 the coefficients R(A, n), n ≥ n 0 , cannot all lie in the interval [1, C] with some constant C = C(A, n 0 ).This deep USD 500 problem [5] remains open, although some progress has been made in [1], [2], [7], [10].It was proved, for instance, that the numbers R(A, n), n ≥ 0, cannot all lie in the interval [1, 7] (see [1]).See also [4], [9], [11] for some constructions of A such that R(A, n) ≥ 1 for all n ≥ 0, but R(A, n) is \"small\" in terms of n.Nathanson [8] describes this Erdős-Turán problem as \"one of the most famous and tantalizing unsolved problems in additive number theory\".Given any polynomial p(z) = d j=0 a j z j with nonnegative coefficients, let us denote the largest quotient between pairs of its coefficients by q(p) = max 0≤i,j≤d a i /a j .In particular, we set q(p) = +∞ if the polynomial p(z) is not the zero polynomial, but has at least one coefficient equal to zero.Clearly, q(p) ≥ 1 with equality if and only if all the coefficients of p(z) are equal.We say that the polynomial p is \"flat\" if this quotient q(p) is \"small\".Recently, the first named author [3] considered the following polynomial version of the Erdős-Turán problem.Let p(z) be a polynomial of degree d with nonnegative real coefficients.In particular, it can be a Newman polynomial, i.e. a polynomial with coefficients 0, 1.As above for the series f (z), consider",

Développant la méthode d'Hermite, Lindemann démontre en 1882 la transcendance de π et énonce un théorème, contenant les résultats précédents, dont la démonstration a été complétée par Weierstrass.Ce théorème, appelé théorème de Lindemann-Weierstrass, est le suivant : Si y 1 , . . ., y n sont des nombres algébriques linéairement indépendants sur Q alors e y 1 , . . ., e y n sont algébriquement indépendants.Dans l'étude de l'indépendance algébrique, parallèlement à l'aspect qualitatif, on s'intéresse à l'aspect quantitatif des résultats.Pour décrire l'analogue quantitatif du théorème précédent, on utilise la notion de \"mesure d'indépendance algébrique\" de e y 1 , . . ., e y n ; c'est la fonction de H et D définie par Φ(e y 1 , . . ., e y n , H, D) = min |P (e y 1 , . . ., e y n )|, où le minimum est pris sur l'ensemble des polynômes non nuls de Z[X 1 , . . ., X n ] de degré (total) ≤ D et de hauteur \"naïve\" ≤ H; la hauteur \"naïve\" d'un polynôme de Z[X 1 , . . ., X n ] étant le maximum des valeurs absolues de ses coefficients.En 1932, par la méthode de Siegel, K. Mahler [M] obtient une minoration asymptotique (en H) de Φ(e y 1 , . . ., e y n , D, H).Il démontre, sous les conditions du théorème de Lindemann-Weierstrass, que Φ(e y 1 , . . ., e y n , D, H) ≥ H -cD n pour H ≥ H 0 , H 0 dépendant de D, y 1 , . . ., y n et c = c(y 1 , . . ., y n ) > 0.Dans ce résultat, la mesure Φ est \"presque\" optimale; en effet, à l'aide du principe des tiroirs de Dirichlet, on montre que pour tout n-uplet de nombres complexes θ 1 , . . ., θ n , il existe D 0 = D 0 (θ 1 , . . ., θ n ) > 0 tel que pour tout D, D ≥ D 0 , et tout H ≥ 1, on ait Φ(θ 1 , . . ., θ n , H, D) ≤ H -D n /(3n!) .",

Introduction.Lucas sequences have many number-theoretic applications.Not surprisingly, several generalizations have been made and examined.It is the purpose of this paper to show that under certain conditions two, a priori unrelated, generalizations of Lucas sequences merge into one.When this occurs the generalized sequences we obtain truly have very rich arithmetic properties.The first of these generalizations, although encountered by earlier authors, was studied in detail by H. Williams in his doctoral thesis [Wi1].This generalization is natural in several respects.As D. H. Lehmer [Le1] once noted Lucas sequences V n , U n are the integral solutions, up to constants, of the Fermat-Pell equation X 2 -DY 2 = 1.The Williams sequences, as we shall name them here, W n , V n , U n are, up to constants, the integral solutions of the cubic norm equation1 that we will call the Mathews equation [Ma].These sequences satisfy many Lucas-like identities [Wi1], [Wi2].Also they were auxiliary tools in primality tests for certain types of numbers (cf.[Wi1], Ch. 5, or [Wi2], pp.49-50).The second generalization of interest here was examined by the author in [Ba1].This generalization is intricately linked to properties of prime divisors in Lucas sequences (we say that a prime p divides a sequence of integers if it divides a number in the sequence).These are group, rank and density properties.Indeed, Lucas sequences are torsion elements of a group structure, relevant to divisibility by primes (see Laxton's paper [Lax]), of which V n , U n form a cyclic subgroup of order 2.This group is infinite, of infinite rank, but finite torsion.Secondly, there is coincidence between the prime divisors p of the Lucas V n -sequence and the primes of even rank r = r(p).",

Introduction.Several authors have studied Iwasawa invariants of cyclotomic Z p -extensions of a number field.The constant Z p -extension of an algebraic function field K over a finite field of characteristic p > 0 has often provided a useful analogy for the study of cyclotomic Z p -extensions of number fields.But little is known about the corresponding results for geometric Z p -extensions of K (cf.[4]).In this paper, we first define a geometric cyclotomic Z p -extension of K (Section 1).Our aim is the determination of all abelian p-extension fields of a rational function field k such that the Iwasawa invariants of a geometric cyclotomic Z p -extension are zero.The main result is stated in Section 2. This is an analogue of G. Yamamoto's theorem ([7]).The proof is based on the central class field and genus field theory.The function field analogue that we need is essentially shown by Bae and Jung [1].Following them, we determine in Section 3 all elementary abelian p-extensions of k whose class number is prime to p. Using this, we conclude the proof of our main theorem in Section 4.",

Introduction.A form (i.e., a homogeneous polynomial) defined over a field K is said to be anisotropic if it has only the trivial zero in K.In the 1930's E. Artin [3] conjectured that for every prime p and any d ≥ 1, an anisotropic form, with coefficients in the field of p-adic numbers Q p , of degree d has at most d 2 variables.Terjanian [15] disproved the conjecture by exhibiting a 2-adic quartic form in 18 variables with no nontrivial 2-adic zero; subsequently, he [16] gave such an example with 20 variables.Generalizing Terjanian's construction, Browkin [5] gave counterexamples for each prime p, but always in fewer than d 3 variables.Later investigations concerning a problem of Hilbert and Kamke allow Arkhipov and Karatsuba [1, 2] to prove that for each prime p, there are infinitely many natural numbers d such that the number of variables required to guarantee the existence of a nontrivial p-adic zero for a form of degree d may need to be exponentially large in terms of d.The latter result was slightly sharpened independently by Brownawell [7], and by Lewis and Montgomery [13] via the introduction of a more efficient principle of p-adic interpolation.Note that we currently possess no counterexample of odd degree.Thus Artin's conjecture is still open in particular for prime degrees.It is still of interest to know precisely when the conjecture is true.It has been verified in case d = 2 (see [11] for short proof), in case d = 3 [9, 12] and in case d = 5 [11] provided the residue class field has at least 47 elements.But, it is impressive that Ax and Kochen [4], by employing methods from Mathematical Logic, were able to show that Artin's conjecture is very nearly true in general.They proved that there exists a function p 0 (d) such that the conjecture is true for all p > p 0 (d).In [10], there is an analogous result which states that to each natural number d ≥ 2, there corresponds a function p(d) such that, if p is a prime number > p(d) and f ∈ Z p [X 1 , . . ., X 2d+1 ] is a form of degree d, then the congruence f (X 1 , . . ., X 2d+1 ) ≡ 0 (mod p 2 ) has 2000",

    "abstract": "Introduction. The Fourier coefficients of modular forms of even integer weight on the full modular group SL(2,Z) can by now be considered classical in number theory. Among their intriguing properties appears a remarkable congruence of Ramanujan τ(n) ≡ σ11(n) mod 691. Plenty of excellent works, such as [9], [10], [12] and [13], that appeared in the last two decades were devoted to various generalisations of this congruence. In the present paper we consider how this congruence and its higher weight analogues can be carried over to congruences between special values of L-functions of modular forms. The first two examples of this phenomenon appeared in the works of N. Koblitz [6] and [7]. In this paper we present a general construction which is based on the classical Rankin’s method. This construction yields Koblitz type congruences in an arbitrary weight, provided an additional hypothesis (see H1 below) is satisfied in that weight. Computer calculations show that H1 is satisfied for all weights less than or equal to 34. We give a heuristic argument that H1 is satisfied frequently. The philosophic foundation of the results of this type is explained in [6]. We will briefly recall it. If we deal with an arithmetic object to which one can associate a motivated L-function, then we can expect that congruences between objects induce, after removing some transcendental factors, congruences modulo the same ideals between the special values of their L-functions. This phenomenon becomes less striking if we take into account that these special values are up to a common factor algebraic numbers. The present construction can be considered as an attempt to prove some assertions along these lines when the “arithmetic objects” are modular forms and the “congruences” are Ramanujan type congruences.",

Introduction.Let C be a complete non-singular irreducible algebraic curve of genus g ≥ 2 defined over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic 0, which is called a curve in this paper.Let P be its point.A positive integer γ is called a gap at P if there exists a regular 1-form ω on C such that ord P (ω) = γ -1.We denote by G(P ) the set of gaps at P .Then the cardinality of G(P ) is equal to g.Now the sequence {γ 1 , . . ., γ g } = G(P ) with γ i < γ j for i < j is called the gap sequence at P .Let π : C → C be a cyclic covering of curves of degree d with total ramification points P .It is well known that in the case of C = P 1 and d = 2 we have G(P ) = {1, 3, . . ., 2g -1}.In the case of C = P 1 and d = 3 (resp.4) the gap sequences G(P ) are known (seeProp. 4.5)).If C = P 1 and d is a prime number ≥ 5, we can also determine the gap sequences G(P ) (for example, see [5], Prop.1).In this paper we shall consider the case C = E where E is an elliptic curve.If d = 2, then G(P ) are known ([4], Prop.2.9, 3.10).However, for d ≥ 3 there are only a few results on the gap sequences G(P ).For example, I. Kuribayashi and K. Komiya ([8], Th. 5) showed the following: If π : C → E is a cyclic covering of an elliptic curve of degree 6 which is branched over three points P i (i = 1, 2, 3) such that π -1 (P i ) = i, then the gap sequence G(P 1 ) can be determined, where P 1 denotes the point of C over P 1 .Moreover, the author ([6], Lemma 4.6) showed the following: Let E be an elliptic curve with the origin Q .Let P 1 (resp.P 2 ) be a point of E such that P 1 = Q and 2where for any positive integer m and any point P of the elliptic curve E the multiplication of P by m is denoted by m[P ].Then there is an element z of K(E) such",

Introduction.En 1895, Tchebychev a montré que si P x désigne le plus grand facteur premier du produit n≤x (n 2 + 1), alors le rapport P x /x tend vers ∞ quand x tend vers ∞.Ce résultat a été amélioré et généralisé tout au long du siècle par de nombreux mathématiciens, notamment par Hooley [Ho], qui en 1967, en apportant plusieurs idées nouvelles à la méthode de Tchebychev, a obtenu la minoration P x > x 11/10 , pour x assez grand.En particulier, il introduisit du crible pour étudier la somme : x<p≤P x log p|{0 ≤ n ≤ x : n 2 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p)}|, ce qui l'a conduit à estimer des sommes d'exponentielles du type m∼M 0≤v<m v 2 +1≡0 (mod m) e -hv m , avec la notation usuelle e(t) = exp(2iπt).Un point remarquable de sa preuve fut alors de transformer cette somme en une somme de Kloosterman portant sur un petit dénominateur, c'est-àdire, une somme du type S(h, k; s) = 0≤u<s (u,s)=1 e hu + ku s (le symbole u désigne un inverse de u modulo s), où s est inférieur à 2M 1/2 , pour appliquer les majorations de Weil : S(h, k; s) (h, k, s) 1/2 s 1/2+ε .",

Introduction.Cassels, in [C], has noticed a remarkable analogy between an algebraic function introduced by Deuring [D] in positive characteristic and the Weierstrass ζ-function in the classical theory of elliptic functions.The purpose of this note is to take this analogy further.One of our main goals is to use this function to give a very explicit description of the universal vectorial extension of elliptic curves, which will give a characteristic p analogue of results of Lang and Katz.Also, Mazur and Tate [MT] have defined, for an elliptic curve defined over a local field of residue characteristic p with ordinary reduction, an analogue of the Weierstrass σ-function which is defined on the formal group of the curve.In characteristic p their construction can be performed for an ordinary curve over any field and it turns out, as in the classical theory, that the logarithmic derivative of the Mazur-Tate σ-function is the characteristic p ζ-function.Acknowledgements.I would like to thank A. Broumas, A. Buium and J. Tate",

It follows from (1.2) that for any positive integer k, dk(n) is the number of ordered k-tuples (n1, . . . , nk) of positive integers such that n1 . . . nk = n. In particular, d2(n) is the number of distinct positive divisors of n. For real z, x, w, define ∆z(x,w) = #{n ≤ x : dz(n) > w}, (1.3) ∆z(x,w) = #{n ≤ x : dz(n) ≥ w}, (1.4) where #B means the number of members of the finite set B (note that ∆z(x,w) ≤ ∆z(x,w)). Our main objective is to obtain good upper bounds for ∆z(x,w) and good lower bounds for ∆z(x,w) when z > 1, x is large, and logw is larger than the normal order of log dz(n) for n ≤ x. Before stating our results, we must specify some notation. Unless otherwise stated, r, t, u, v, w, x, y, z, α, β, δ, e denote real numbers, with e > 0. (For consistency with the notation of some earlier authors, we shall let y denote a positive integer in Section 3.) We use γ to denote Euler’s constant, while k, m, n represent positive integers and p is a (positive) prime number. If a is a nonnegative integer, p ‖n means that p |n and",

Introduction.Soient k un corps de nombres et A son anneau des entiers.On notera k une clôture algébrique de k.Soit F un polynôme absolument irréductible de k[X, Y ] tel que la courbe F (X, Y ) = 0 soit de genre non nul.On sait, d'après Siegel [8], qu'il n'existe qu'un nombre fini de couples (x, y) ∈ A × A tels que F (x, y) = 0. La méthode de Siegel ne permet pas de déterminer de façon effective ces couples.Dans le cas où F ∈ Z[X, Y ] et le genre de la courbe F (X, Y ) = 0 est 1, Baker et Coates [1] ont donné un majorant de la hauteur max{|x|, |y|} des points entiers de la courbe, explicitement calculable en fonction des coefficients de F .Schmidt [4] a récemment amélioré ce résultat de Baker et Coates, et l'a étendu à un corps de nombres k quelconque.Dans ce travail on s'intéresse aux majorations de la hauteur des points entiers sur des courbes hyperelliptiques.Rappelons qu'une courbe C sur k est dite hyperelliptique si son corps de fonctions k(C) contient une fonction f de degré 2 ([9]); il en résulte que k(C) possède un k(f )-automorphisme τ tel que τ = Id et τ 2 = Id.Supposons maintenant que la courbe C définie par F (X, Y ) = 0 soit hyperelliptique de genre g ≥ 2. Notons Σ l'ensemble des anneaux de valuation discrète de k(C) qui contiennent k et Σ ∞ l'ensemble des éléments de Σ qui se trouvent au-dessus de l'anneau de valuation discrète de k(X) définie par 1/X.Considérons l'ensemble V (Q) de valeurs absolues de Q, qui contient la valeur absolue ordinaire et pour tout premier p ∈ Z la valeur absolue | • | p définie par |p n a/b| p = p -n pour a, b ∈ Z avec (a, b) = 1.Soit V (k) = {| • | υ : υ ∈ M (k)} l'ensemble des valeurs absolues de k qui prolongent les éléments de V (Q).Si x = (x 0 , . . ., x n ) est un point de l'espace projectif P n (k) et υ ∈ M (k), on note |x| υ = max{|x 0 | υ , . . ., |x n | υ }.On appelle la quantité H k (x) = υ∈M (k) |x| d υ υ où d υ sont les degrés locaux, hauteur de x (relativement au corps de",

En 1927 Vinogradov démontrait que n(p) = O(p 1/(2e 1/2 ) (log p) 2 ) (cf. [14]), ce résultat étant amélioré par Burgess qui en 1957 établissait que n(p) = O(p α ) pour tout réel α > 1/(4e 1/2 ) (cf. [2]).Par ailleurs, en 1942, Linnik établissait sous hypothèse de Riemann la majoration n(p) = O(p ε ) pour tout ε > 0 (cf.[10]).Enfin, en 1952, toujours sous hypothèse de Riemann, Ankeny établissait la majoration n(p) = O((log p) 2 ) (cf. [1]).Cette dernière estimation n'est pas loin d'être optimale puisque, d'après Graham et Ringrose, n(p) = Ω(log p log log log p) (cf.[5]).Notons aussi qu' en 1950 Nagell démontrait que r(p) = O(p 1/2 ) (cf. [12]), cette majoration étant améliorée ultérieurement par Linnik et Vinogradov qui démontraient que r(p) = O(p 1/4+ε ) (cf. [15]).Un problème plus général est celui de la détermination, pour tout entier k ≥ 1, du plus petit entier b(k) ayant la propriété suivante : pour tout entier a premier à k, il existe un entier x premier à k dans l'intervalle [1, b(k)] tel que ax soit carré modulo k.Une forme voisine de ce problème a été étudiée par A. Zaharescu.Utilisant les travaux de Burgess sur les sommes de caractères, A. Zaharescu a démontré (cf.[17]), que pour tout nombre réel ε > 0, H(k) k 1/4+ε , la constante impliquée par le symbole dépendant de ε, H(k) désignant le plus petit entier ayant la propriété suivante : pour tout entier a premier à k, il existe un entier x premier à k dans l'intervalle [-H(k), H(k)] tel que ax soit carré modulo k.Cette majoration lui permet dans ce même article d'obtenir des résultats d'approximation diophantienne.Il formule aussi la conjecture (C) H(k) k ε .",

    "abstract": "1. Greenberg’s conjecture. In the late 1950’s Iwasawa introduced a powerful technique for studying class groups and unit groups of number elds. Motivated by the theory of curves over nite elds, Iwasawa’s theory of Zp-extensions has since become a widely used tool in algebraic number theory, Galois theory, and arithmetic geometry. We describe in this section a conjecture of Greenberg concerning the structure of a classical Iwasawa module, and we mention a Galois-theoretic consequence concerning free prop-extensions of number elds. Let K be an algebraic number eld and p an odd prime. By a multiple Zp-extension K1=K we mean a Galois extension with Galois group ’Z d for some positive integer d. In what follows we will be particularly interested in two such extensions of K for which we reserve the following notation: K cyc =K denotes the cyclotomic Zp-extension of K. e K=K denotes the compositum of all Zp-extensions of K. Let F be a nite extension of K contained in K1, and denote by A(F ) the Sylow p-subgroup of the ideal class group of F . The Galois group of F=K acts onA(F ) in the natural way, makingA(F ) into aZp[Gal(F=K)]-module. As F varies over all nite subextensions the A(F ) form an inverse system (under norm maps) and we denote by A the inverse limit. The group A then carries a natural structure as a module over the Iwasawa algebra",

    "abstract": "For a prime number l and a number field k, denote by λl(k) the Iwasawa λ-invariant associated with the ideal class group of the cyclotomic Zl-extension k∞(l) over k. It is conjectured that this invariant is zero for any prime l and any totally real number field k (cf. [7]). Several authors have given some sufficient conditions for the conjecture when k is a real abelian field (cf. [1]–[9]). Using them, many examples of the vanishing of λ-invariants for real abelian number fields are given. However, it seems that an example of a totally real non-abelian field has not yet been given. In this paper we give quaternion extensions K over the rational number field Q with λ2(K) = 0. A Galois extension K over Q is called a quaternion extension if the Galois group G(K/Q) of K over Q is isomorphic to the quaternion group H8 of order 8. The quaternion group H8 is a group H8 = 〈σ, τ〉 of order 8 with σ4 = 1, σ2 = τ2 and τστ−1 = σ−1. The main purpose of this paper is to prove the following: Theorem. Let p be a prime number with p ≡ 3 (mod 8), k = Q(√2,√p) and k∞(2) the cyclotomic Z2-extension of k. Then there exist natural numbers x, y with x2 − y2p = 2p. Let K∞(2) be the cyclotomic Z2-extension of K = k( √ (x+ y √ p)(2 + √ 2)). Then the Galois group G(K/Q) of K over Q is isomorphic to the quaternion group H8 and the λ-invariant λ(K∞(2)/K) of K∞(2) over K vanishes. First we recall the following lemma which plays an important role in our proof of this theorem:",

Introduction.Un problème classique de la théorie des nombres est la recherche de familles paramétrées infinies de corps de nombres algébriques dont un système fondamental d'unités s'écrit simplement en fonction des paramètres.En degré 2, Shanks [10] a donné des familles paramétrées de corps quadratiques réels Q(α) pour lesquelles l'unité fondamentale ε est particulièrement simple, c'est-à-dire de la forme ε = αβ n , alors que la longueur du développement en fraction continue de α est linéaire en n.Ces familles ont été généralisées par plusieurs auteurs, dont Halter-Koch [6], Mollin et Williams [8], [12], qui introduisent de nouveaux paramètres.En degré 3, C. Levesque et G. Rhin [7] ont étudié le développement par l'AJP de deux familles infinies de corps de nombres algébriques cubiques non totalement réels dépendant chacune de deux paramètres.L'une de ces familles a également été étudiée par A. Farhane [5], [4] qui, le premier, a montré la fondamentalité de l'unité conjecturée par C. Levesque et G. Rhin lorsque l'un des paramètres est suffisamment grand.Dans [1] nous avons étudié leur développement par l'algorithme de Voronoï et obtenu l'unité fondamentale de ces corps.Nous pouvons considérer ces familles comme des analogues de celle de Shanks en degré 3. Dans cet article, nous étudions le corps K = Q(α) où α est la seule racine réelle du polynôme fNous généralisons ainsi les familles précédentes, qui correspondent à r = t = 1, et obtenons des résultats semblables, à savoir :• le développement par l'AJP et celui par l'algorithme de Voronoï sont identiques;",

    "abstract": "Introduction. On sait (voir [Hof] ou [Odl 1]) qu’il n’existe qu’un nombre fini de corps galoisiens a multiplication complexe (i.e., des corps de nombres totalement imaginaires, extensions quadratiques de corps totalement reels) de nombres de classes d’ideaux egaux a 1. Ici : (a) nous determinons tous ceux qui sont des corps de classes de Hilbert de corps quadratiques imaginaires (il y en a 30 et ils sont abeliens); (b) nous determinons tous ceux qui sont abeliens et sont des corps de classes de Hilbert de corps quadratiques reels (il y en a 39), (c) nous construisons 26 d’entre eux non abeliens et qui sont des corps de classes de Hilbert de corps quadratiques reels; et (d) nous montrons qu’il est raisonnable de conjecturer que tout corps galoisien, non abelien, a multiplication complexe, de nombre de classes egal a 1 et qui est un corps de classes de Hilbert d’un corps quadratique reel est l’un de ces 26 corps. Autrement dit, il existe au moins et conjecturalement exactement 96 corps quadratiques a corps de classes de Hilbert principaux et a multiplication complexe. Expliquons maintenant le principe de cette determination. Si k est un corps quadratique imaginaire de corps de classes de Hilbert note H(k), nous montrons que H(k) est un corps a multiplication complexe si et seulement si il est egal au corps des genres Gk de k. Notre premier objectif est donc de determiner tous les corps de genres qui sont des corps imaginaires abeliens de nombres de classes relatifs egaux a 1 : il y a 74 tels corps (voir Corollaire 2). Nous en deduisons tous les corps quadratiques imaginaires a corps de classes de Hilbert principaux et a multiplication complexe. Supposons donc pour la suite de cette introduction que k est un corps quadratique reel. Soient Hl(k) et Hs(k) ses corps de classes de Hilbert aux sens large et restreint. Il est clair que Hl(k) qui est totalement reel n’est evidemment pas a multiplication complexe, et que Hs(k) contient Hl(k) et",

Introduction.Soit x un nombre rationnel.Notons d(x) le nombre de termes de la fraction continue de longueur paire de x.Y. Pourchet dans une lettre à M. Mendès France d'une part et G. Choquet dans une série de comptes rendus à l'Académie des Sciences [2] d'autre part, ont démontré que si x n'est ni un entier ni l'inverse d'un entier, alors sup d(x n ) = ∞.La démonstration de Y. Pourchet, non publiée, est résumée dans l'article de A. J. van der Poorten [7].Nous nous intéressons à un problème similaire portant sur les nombres quadratiques réels.Si α est un nombre quadratique réel, son développement en fraction continue est périodique, de longueur de période primitive l(α).En Novembre 1992, lors d'un congrés à Tokyo, M. Mendès France posait la question suivante ([5], problème n o 6) : pour tout nombre quadratique réel α, est-il vrai que lim supUne première réponse, à mettre en parallèle avec le cas des entiers dans le problème sur les nombres rationnels, peut déjà être faite : R. Paysant-Le Roux et E. Dubois remarquent dans [6] que si α est une unité quadratique, alors l(α) ≤ 2. La question doit donc être reformulée en ne considérant plus que les nombres quadratiques réels qui ne sont pas des unités quadratiques.L'existence du nombre l(α n ) pour tout n ≥ 1 est équivalente à α 2 ∈ Q, il est donc bien entendu que si ce n'est pas le cas, n désignera un nombre impair.Nous montrons que, pour une large classe de nombres réels quadratiques, la réponse à la question de M. Mendès France est non seulement positive mais que l(α n ) tend vers l'infini avec n et ceci de manière explicite.Nous établissons :2 .Supposons que α vérifie l'une des conditions suivantes",

    "abstract": "ACTA ARITHMETICA 108.2 (2003) Une propriété arithmétique des bases additives.Un critère de non-base par Franc ¸ois Hennecart (Bordeaux)1. Introduction.En 1994, l'auteur [5] donnait une démonstration à une conjecture orale de F. Dress, selon laquelle il existe une suite C qui n'est pas une base additive, bien que la suite C (2) des carrés de ses éléments est une base d'ordre 4. Cela améliorait de façon optimale un résultat antérieur de J.-M.Deshouillers et É.Fouvry [3].Le résultat ainsi que la structure même de la démonstration ne sont pas remis en cause, mais une obstruction arithmétique, à savoir que le nombre de représentations d'un entier n en somme de 4 carrés ne tend pas vers l'infini lorsque n tend vers l'infini (voir [4]), montre clairement que la Proposition 1 de [5] ne peut se déduire d'une formule asymptotique issue de la méthode du cercle.Cette obstruction se traduit dans cette formule asymptotique par le fait que la série singulière est de l'ordre de 1/n si n est un multiple d'une grande puissance de 2. L'erreur commise se situe dans le Lemme 11 de [5] qui ne s'applique pas pour p = 2. Nous donnons ici une construction corrigée de la suite C aux propriétés requises.L'existence d'une telle suite C peut paraître étonnant au premier abord, surtout lorsqu'on constate que toute suite est beaucoup plus riche que la suite de ses carrés, si l'on s'en tient à la comparaison des fonctions de comptage respectives.Cependant ce type de paradoxes est fréquent dans la théorie des bases additives, et trouve de nombreuses illustrations notamment dans l'étude des propriétés extrémales des bases : on sait par exemple construire des bases d'ordre h dites économiques, c'est-à-dire dont la fonction de comptage se comporte asymptotiquement comme cx 1/h (cf.[7]), alors qu'il existe une suite A contenant 0 et 1, telle que #(A ∩ [1, x]) ε x 1-ε pour tout ε > 0, qui n'est pas une base.Notons simplement que la répartition des éléments d'une base économique dans toutes les progressions arithmétiques est bien équilibrée, à l'inverse de la répartition des éléments de la suite A.",

Corps des séries de Puiseux.Si K désigne un corps commutatif, le corps K(X) des fractions rationnelles à coefficients dans K est un corps valué, par la valuation usuelle associée aux polynômes (valuation associée au premier X).On sait qu'alors K(X) n'est pas un corps complet et que son complété est le corps K((X)) des séries de Laurent.K((X)) est alors muni d'une valuation discrète ν qui étend la valuation de K(X).On définitPour tout entier n = 0, on pose K n = K((X n )) (corps de séries de Laurent en la variable X n ).Pour tout couple d'entiers (n, m) tel que n divise m (disons m = an), on définit l'application ϕ n,m : K n → K m de la manière suivante : à une série k≥k 0 a k X k n on associe la série k≥k 0 a k X ak m .Les applications ϕ n,m sont clairement des homomorphismes de corps et la donnée des K n et des ϕ n,m forme visiblement un système inductif.Pour n = 1, on note plus simplement K((X 1 )) = K((X)).Il apparaît alors que le corps K n est un corps de rupture du polynôme P (T ) = T n -X sur K((X)), de même si m = an, alors K m est un corps de rupture du polynôme P (T ) = T a -X sur K n .Ceci justifie alors la notation X n = X 1/n que nous emploierons désormais.Les corps K n sont donc des extensions finies de K((X)).On définit alors :Définition.On appelle corps des séries de Puiseux à coefficients dans K le corps noté Puis(K) obtenu en prenant la limite inductive du système de corps et d'homomorphismes (K n , ϕ n,m ).Ainsi, le corps Puis(K) est une extension algébrique de K((X)).Par ailleurs, Puis(K) possède une unique valuation qui prolonge celle de K((X)) (puisque K((X)) est complet à valuation discrète).Nous continuerons à noter cette valuation ν.Si k≥k 0 a k X k/n désigne une série de Puiseux (a k 0 = 0), on a alors ν( k≥k 0 a k X k/n ) = k 0 /n.",

    "abstract": "Clearly, (1.1) implies (1.2). The question whether (1.1) is true was first raised by A. Fajardo Miron and H. W. Lenstra, Jr. [5, Sec. 8] when they were looking for ways to find equation orders of small index in a given ring of integers. Independently, H. Cohen observed in 1989 from numerical examples that (1.2) always seems to hold for fields of small degree. Cohen was looking for integral bases that are small in some sense, and one may wonder if these small basis elements can all lie in small number fields. In Section 2 we will show that (1.1) is true for Galois extensions of prime power degree, and for certain other classes of extensions as well. We will deduce (1.1) for all fields of degree less than 12. It is not hard to see that (1.1) is false for any normal field whose Galois group is dihedral of order 12. In Section 3 we prove the stronger result that (1.2) is false for such a field too. Notation. Throughout this paper, K ⊂ L denotes an extension of number fields with rings of integers A ⊂ B. We let SK(B) be the A-module generated by integers that are not primitive, i.e., generated by all x ∈ B with K(x) 6= L. The subfield integer index s(L/K) ∈ Z>0 ∪ {∞} is defined to be the index [B : SK(B)]. Note that (1.1) is equivalent to s(L/Q) 6= 1. For a finite group G and Z[G]-module M we let SG(M) be the additive subgroup ofM generated by elements ofM that are fixed by some non-trivial",

Introduction.Let A ⊆ {1, . . ., N } and η = |A|/N .In [4] Roth studied how well can A be distributed in arithmetic progressions.If the sequence n, n + q, . . ., n + (k -1)q has t elements in {1, . . ., N } then it is reasonable to think that a well-distributed sequence would have \"about\" ηt elements in this sequence if k is \"big enough\" relative to N .Thus if we set1 for a well-distributed sequence, then V (n, q, √ N /2 ) should be \"small\" for every integer n, 1 ≤ q ≤ √ N .(It is easy to see that if η = 0 or 1 then V (n, q, k) = 0 for every n, q, k.) Roth proved that there does not exist a non-trivial well-distributed A in this sense, because for every A there exist integers n, 1 ≤ q ≤ √ N with V (n, q, √ N /2 ) ≥ c η(1 -η)N 1/4 (and 1 and g(n) = 1≤k≤N 1≤n-k≤N",

    "abstract": "It is unusual for an irreducible polynomial to have a root with rational real part or with rational imaginary part. Of course, such polynomials exist: one can simply take the minimal polynomial of, say, 1+ i √ 2 or √ 2+ i. The same applies to polynomials having a root of rational modulus. But it turns out to be of interest to characterize these three kinds of polynomials. We therefore define our first family of polynomials, C1, to consist of the minimal polynomials of some algebraic number having rational real part. Our second family, C2, consists of the minimal polynomials of some algebraic number having rational imaginary part, while our third family, C3, consists of the minimal polynomials of some algebraic number having rational modulus . We describe the polynomials of each family in Sections 3, 4 and 5. Then in Sections 6, 7 and 8 we classify the polynomials belonging to two of the three families, while in Section 9 we do the same for the polynomials belonging to all three families. Section 2 contains preliminary results needed for the proofs. For a rational linear polynomial, its root has rational real part, imaginary part and modulus. An irreducible quadratic polynomial z + pz + q with rational coefficients and with discriminant ∆ = p− 4q belongs to C1 if and only if ∆ 0, and to C3 if and only if ∆ < 0 and q is a square (in which case it belongs to C1 ∩ C3). Hence it belongs to C2 ∩ C3 if and only if −∆ and q are both squares (in which case it belongs to C1 ∩ C2 ∩ C3). For −∆ = a and q = b this latter condition is 4b − a = p. This is essentially the Pythagoras equation, with solution p = u−v, a = 2uv and 2b = u +v for some rationals u and v. For the rest of the paper, therefore, we can restrict our attention to polynomials of degree at least 3.",

The usual quotient towards the unit interval is given by the base 2 expansion of real numbers, which in turn is induced by the doubling map. In this paper we replace the doubling map with an n-dimensional generalization of the tent map; this allows us to define Kakutani-von Neumann transformations in simplexes of arbitrary dimensions. The resulting maps are piecewise-linear bijections (not just mod 0 bijections), whose orbits are all uniformly distributed; in particular, they are uniquely ergodic w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure. The forward orbit of a certain vertex provides an enumeration of all points in the simplex having dyadic coordinates, and this enumeration can be translated via the n-dimensional Minkowski function to an enumeration of all rational points. In the course of establishing the above results, we introduce a family of {+1,-1}-valued functions, constituting an n-dimensional analogue of the classical Walsh functions.",

Pour que K soit engendré par un entier réciproque, il faut et il suffit que Gal(L/Q) soit inclus dans le produit en couronne C 2 S n ou autrement dit que K possède un automorphisme d'ordre 2 (cf.[L1] si K admet un plongement réel et l'appendice pour le cas général).À ce point, il est naturel de demander si un sous-groupe de C 2 S n peut être réalisé comme groupe de Galois du polynôme minimal d'un nombre réciproque et plus précisément, du polynôme minimal d'un nombre de Salem.Le travail qui suit s'intéresse à cette question et se décompose en deux parties.Dans la première, on réalise explicitement le produit en couronne C 2 H (H sous-groupe transitif de S n ) comme groupe de Galois sur Q d'un polynôme irréductible g en supposant H réalisé par un polynôme f .C'est donc un problème de plongement bien connu mais la résolution explicite que nous donnons permet de choisir g réciproque et même polynôme minimal d'un nombre de Salem si le polynôme f est totalement réel.Rappelons, avant de poursuivre, quelques définitions.Un corps K est dit de type CM s'il possède un automorphisme c d'ordre 2 tel que pour tout plongement σ de K dans C, σ • c = σ.Un polynôme réciproque est un polynôme P vérifiant P (X) = X d P (1/X) (d étant le degré de P ), un entier réciproque est un entier algébrique dont le polynôme minimal est réciproque (i.e.un entier algébrique conjugué à son inverse), et un nombre de Salem est un entier algébrique réciproque, réel, strictement supérieur à 1, dont tous les autres conjugués ont un module inférieur ou égal à 1 avec au moins un conjugué de module 1.

    "abstract": "The two faces of the twisted Kummer surface by Adam Logan (Montréal, QC) 1. Introduction.Let C be a curve of genus 2 defined by an equation of the form y 2 = f (x) over a number field F .In studying the arithmetic of C, it is necessary to consider the Jacobian Jac(C) of C, an abelian variety of dimension 2. However, this variety is rather difficult to compute with directly (it is most naturally embedded into projective space as the intersection of 72 quadrics in P 15 ).Accordingly, one often considers the quotient of Jac(C) by the involution -1 that takes the class of a divisor D to the class of -D.This quotient, the Kummer surface of C, can be embedded as a quartic surface in P 3 with 16 nodes; this is the largest number of isolated singularities possible for a quartic surface in P 3 .The minimal desingularization of the quotient can also be embedded as the intersection of three quadrics in P 5 .To determine the rank of the Jacobian over F by the method of 2descent, it is necessary to study certain twists of Jac(C)-these are varieties isomorphic to Jac(C) over F (the algebraic closure of F ), but not necessarily over F itself.These are twists by Galois cocycles with values in the set of translations by 2-torsion points.Since translation by a 2-torsion point commutes with multiplication by -1 on Jac(C), the same cocycles define twists of Jac(C)/±1 (or equivalently, multiplication by -1 is still defined on the twists; the quotient of the twist is isomorphic to the twist of the quotient).The minimal desingularizations of these twists of Jac(C)/±1 can again be embedded as the intersection of three quadrics in P 5 .In previous work [7], Ronald van Luijk and I studied the geometry and arithmetic of these twists using this embedding: we determined the Néron-Severi group in the generic case, studied the configuration of lines, analyzed some elliptic fibrations, and proved that some of these surfaces have no rational points by means of the Brauer-Manin obstruction.",

A result of Ribet characterizes the fields of definition of these varieties together with their endomorphisms, in terms of a Galois cohomology class canonically attached to them. However, when the building blocks have quaternionic multiplication, then the field of definition of the varieties can be strictly smaller than the field of definition of their endomorphisms. What we do is to give a characterization of the fields of definition of the varieties in this case (also in terms of their associated Galois cohomology class), by translating the problem into the language of group extensions with non-abelian kernel. We also make the computations that are needed in order to calculate in practice these fields from our characterization.",

Let {ρ`} be a two-dimensional strictly compatible family of integral `-adic representations ofG with exceptional set S, and for p / ∈ S put a(p) = tr ρ`(σp) with any ` 6= p.

Zygmund, did not stay at the reorganized institution.The newly formed staff of the faculty was not active in mathematical research but was doing their best at( 1 ) A literary biography of J. Kubilius was published by his student V. Stakėnas [39].",

    "abstract": "Hadamard products of certain power series byHabib Sharif (Shiraz) 1. Introduction.In [8] we defined an E-algebraic function, an analogue of the concept of a differentially algebraic function over a perfect field K of characteristic p > 0. In this paper, we shall study the Hadamard product of differentially algebraic and E-algebraic power series.The p-multiplicative and p-additive power series are introduced and it will be shown that these two classes of series are closed under the Hadamard product operation.We also show that the Hadamard product of a rational power series with a D-algebraic (respectively, E-algebraic) power series in several variables is not necessarily D-algebraic (respectively, E-algebraic).From now on L will denote a field of characteristic zero.Suppose that P (x 0 , x 1 , . . ., x n+1 ) is a non-zero polynomial in n + 2 variables with coefficients in L. Then the equationwhere ω (n) = dω (n-1) /dx, ω (0) (x) = ω(x), is called an algebraic differential equation (ADE, for short).A function (or a formal power series) f (x) ∈ L [[x]] which satisfies an ADE as above is called differentially algebraic (Dalgebraic, for short) over L(x).In other words, a function f (x) is D-algebraic (over L(x)) if and only if f, f , . . ., f (n) , . . .are algebraically dependent over L(x).Example 1.1.(i) The series f (x) = n≥0 n!x n is D-algebraic since x 2 f (x) + (x -1)f (x) + 1 = 0.(ii) The series f = n≥0 x n 2 is also D-algebraic (see [4]).A function (or a power series) f is called transcendentally transcendental (TT, for short) if it is not D-algebraic.That is, if it satisfies no algebraic differential equation.For example, the series g = n≥0 x 2 n is TT (see [4]).",

Viewed in another light, then, this result says that j(EA,B) cannot be “too close” to 1728 (relative to the sizes of A and B) if EA,B(Q) contains a torsion point of order at least 5. In [5], the author proved similar results bounding |B| by a power of |A|, again for EA,B with certain torsion/isogeny structure. One may similarly view these results as saying that j(EA,B) cannot be “too close” to 0 for curves EA,B with given torsion structure. This prompts us to formulate here a general result on the approximation of a fixed algebraic number by the j-invariants of elliptic curves with certain torsion structure. The main results are stated over arbitrary number fields and contain, as special cases, most of the results in [2, 5]. It is easy to show that for each N , {j(E) : E/Q admits a rational N -isogeny}",

Albu. The main tool is a generalisation of a theorem by M. Kneser which, in our language, is a criterion for the universal algebra to be a field when the base ring A is itself a field. This theorem implies also the theorem of A. Schinzel on linearly independent roots. We discuss examples involving the injective hull of the multiplicative group of a field and we develop criteria for Galois extensions which allow a co-Galois grading, in particular for the cyclic case.",

Introduction.Let K be a number field, and p be a prime number.Let S be the set of primes lying above p, and K S be the maximal p-extension of K which is unramified outside the primes above S. Then K is called p-rational if the Galois group Gal(K S /K) is a free pro-p-group.In [Gr], Greenberg made the following conjecture.Conjecture.For any odd prime p and for any positive integer t, there exists a p-rational number fieldThe conjecture is confirmed for all odd primes p and t = 1, 2 (see [BM, BR]) and for infinitely many primes p and t = 3 (see [Ko]).In [BR], Barbulescu and Ray considered the following generalization of the conjecture.Problem.Given a finite abelian group G and a prime p, decide if there exists one (resp.infinitely many) p-rational number field (s) K such that Gal(K/Q) ∼ = G.In [BM], Benmerieme and Movahhedi proved that there exist infinitely many quadratic p-rational fields for all odd primes p and that there exist infinitely many biquadratic 3-rational fields.In [BR], Barbulescu and Ray showed that for q = 2, 3 and for any t ≥ 1 and p ≥ 5, there exit infinitely many p-rational number fields K such that Gal(K/Q) ∼ = (Z/qZ) t under the Cohen-Lenstra-Martinet heuristics [CL, CM] and the conjecture of Hofmann and Zhang [HZ].For more recent work on p-rational fields, see [CLS, LQ].In this paper, we prove the following theorem.Theorem 1.1.There are infinitely many triquadratic 3-rational fields.",

    "abstract": "Transformation homographique appliquée à un développement en fraction continue fini ou infini par Salah Labhalla (Marrakech) et Henri Lombardi (Besançon)Introduction.Soit m un entier positif et x un nombre rationnel.L'algorithme de Mendès France ([Men1]) permet de calculer le développement en fraction continue de mx à partir de celui de x sans passer par le calcul du rationnel x.Cet algorithme permet en conséquence d'obtenir des informations de nature théorique sur la manière dont se comporte \"la multiplication par m\" lorsqu'elle est vue comme portant directement sur les développements en fraction continue.Dans [Men1] par exemple, Mendès France obtient la borne suivante.Notons θ(m) la longueur maximum des développements en fraction continue \"pairs\" pour les rationnels de dénominateur m, et notons lf (x) la longueur du développement en fraction continue de x (pour x rationnel).Alors, si x est un rationnel positif, on a lf (mx) ≤ (lf (x) -1)θ(m) + 1.Dans la suite, nous abrégeons \"développement en fraction continue\" par dfc.Des majorations analogues mais plus compliquées sont obtenues dans [Men2] pour lf ((ax + b)/(cx + d)) lorsque a, b, c, d sont des entiers premiers entre eux dans leur ensemble.Dans l'article présent, nous constatons que l'algorithme de [Men1] calcule en fait le dfc de (ax + b)/d pour x rationnel et a, b, d entiers avec ad > 0. Ceci nous permet de simplifier l'algorithme donné dans [Men2] et nous en déduisons une meilleure majoration pour lf ((ax + b)/(cx + d)).Si on note lfp(x) et lf i(x) les longueurs des développements en fraction continue pair et impair de x on a précisément le résultat suivant.Théorème 2. Soit un rationnel x et des entiers a, b, c > 0 et d.On suppose a, b, c et d premiers entre eux dans leur ensemble et le déterminant ∆ = ad -bc = 0. Alors, si ∆ > 0, on a 1991",

    "abstract": "Propriétés additives des suites et de leurs carrés par Franc ¸ois Hennecart (Talence) 1. Introduction 1.1.Historique et énoncés des résultats.Le théorème de Lagrange (tout entier est somme de quatre carrés), plus généralement le problème de Waring (tout entier est somme de neuf cubes, dix-neuf bicarrés, . ..), et le problème de Goldbach (tout entier supérieur à deux est somme d'au plus trois nombres premiers), énoncés au XVIII e siècle, sont des exemples de problèmes additifs, en cela qu'on cherche à représenter tout entier (ou tout entier assez grand) comme somme d'entiers d'une suite donnée.Plus généralement, on dit qu'une suite d'entiers A est une base additive (ou simplement base), s'il existe un entier h tel que tout entier soit somme d'au plus h éléments de A; si c'est le cas, le plus petit entier h ayant la propriété requise s'appelle l'ordre de la base.Le fait que les puissances k-ièmes constituent une base a été démontré par Hilbert en 1909, et le résultat que la suite des nombres premiers, auxquels on joint 0 et 1, est une base, est dû à Shnirel'man, et obtenu en 1930.Motivé par le problème de Waring, F. Dress a posé, au début des années 70, la question de savoir si la suite des puissances k-ièmes des éléments d'une base était encore une base.Une réponse négative a été apportée en 1976 par J.-M.Deshouillers, P. Erdős et A. Sárközy [3] : plus précisément, ils ont montré qu'il existait une base d'ordre trois dont la suite des carrés des éléments n'est pas une base.Plus étonnant encore, ils ont montré aussi l'existence d'une suite qui n'est pas une base, alors que la suite des carrés des éléments est une base d'ordre six.Ce résultat a été étendu par J.-M.Deshouillers et É.Fouvry [4], qui ont prouvé que, pour toute suite K d'entiers positifs, il existe une suite dont les puissances k-ièmes des éléments constituent une base si et seulement si k est dans K.L'objet de ce travail est d'améliorer les résultats sur les carrés en donnant les meilleurs énoncés possibles :",

Introduction.On cherche une courbe de genre 2, contre-exemple au principe de Hasse, à jacobienne simple dont le groupe de Mordell-Weil soit de rang le plus grand possible.Des exemples de ce type existent déjà dans la littérature, voir par exemple l'article de Flynn [Fly].Flynn cherche des exemples parmi des courbes définies par des équations dont les coefficients sont bornés.Il a besoin de calculer le rang du groupe de Mordell-Weil de la jacobienne d'une courbe pour montrer que la courbe est un contre-exemple au principe de Hasse.Cette méthode est liée à l'obstruction de Brauer-Manin.Dans cet article, on obtient des courbes de genre 2 comme intersection résiduelle d'une surface de Del Pezzo S de degré 4 et d'une quadrique dans P 4 .L'arithmétique dans S permet de trouver des éléments du groupe de Mordell-Weil S de la jacobienne de C et des relations entre ces éléments.Avec un choix judicieux, une courbe de genre 2, ainsi construite, aura les propriétés cherchées.Pour les courbes trouvées à l'aide des surfaces de Del Pezzo, on ne peut pas calculer le rang du groupe de Mordell-Weil de la jacobienne associée.On doit donc utiliser une autre méthode pour montrer que ces courbes sont des contre-exemples au principe de Hasse.La méthode utilisée ici est similaire à celle utilisée par Wuthrich (voir [Wu]) qui consiste à travailler simultanément avec deux normes.Comme Colliot-Thélène fait remarquer à Wuthrich, cette technique est aussi liée à l'obstruction de Brauer-Manin.Voici les deux exemples construits à l'aide des surfaces de Del Pezzo :Théorème 1.1.La courbe projective lisse C de genre 2, dont un morceau affine est définie par",

He was a student of Ananda Rau, who worked with Hardy on Summability and was a contemporary of Ramanujan in Cambridge. Marshall Stone met Chandrasekharan in Madras and was so impressed by the young man that he arranged for him to go in 1946 to the Institute of Advanced Study in Princeton, to work as assistant to Hermann Weyl. During his Princeton years, Chandrasekharan had an extensive collaboration with Salomon Bochner, which resulted in papers and a book in analysis centering around Fourier transforms. In 1949 Homi Bhabha, founder of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Bombay, invited him to join the School of Mathematics of TIFR. Chandrasekharan became a full professor there in 1952. The current success of this institute owes a great deal to his skills as an organizer and administrator.",

Introduction.On sait depuis les travaux de Philippon [10]-[12], puis Bost-Gillet-Soulé [3] dans le cadre de l'intersection arithmétique, comment définir la hauteur des variétés projectives, l'idée étant de considérer un point comme une variété de dimension zéro et de généraliser ceci en dimension supérieure.De même que dans le cas des points, on sait pour les variétés abéliennes munies d'un fibré en droites ample et symétrique définir une hauteur particulièrement agréable : la hauteur canonique h L , ou hauteur normalisée.En dimension zéro, il existe un théorème caractérisant les points de hauteur normalisée nulle ; c'est un résultat de Kronecker dans le cas de G m .Philippon [12] dans le cas d'un produit de courbes elliptiques, puis Zhang [20] et David-Philippon [5] dans le cas général ont montré comment généraliser ce résultat pour caractériser les sous-variétés de hauteur normalisée nulle : ce sont les translatées d'une sous-variété abélienne par un point de torsion.On dit qu'une telle sous-variété est une sous-variété de torsion.La réponse à cette question résoud une conjecture de Bogomolov, qui dans sa formulation initiale a été démontrée en premier par Ullmo [18].Ceci étant, on peut se demander comment minorer la hauteur normalisée d'une sous-variété de hauteur non nulle d'une variété abélienne.Dans leur article [5], David et Philippon ont formulé un problème général (le problème 1.7) contenant cette question.En terme du degré défini ci-dessous, on peut notamment faire ressortir de la discussion suivant la formulation de leur problème l'énoncé suivant :Conjecture 1 (David-Philippon).Soit A une variété abélienne définie sur un corps de nombres k, munie d'un fibré ample et symétrique L.

    "abstract": "Linear forms and arithmetic equivalence byMarius Somodi (Cedar Falls, IA) 1. Introduction.One of the problems in algebraic number theory is to characterize number fields by splitting properties of prime ideals from the ground field.In the study of this problem various types of equivalence between number fields have been introduced.To fix the notations, let p be any rational prime, and let K and K be two number fields.Let f 1 (p) ≤ . . .≤ f r (p) be the inertial degrees of p in K and f 1 (p) ≤ . . .≤ f s (p) be the inertial degrees of p in K .Let g K (p) = r and g K (p) = s be the number of distinct prime divisors of p in K and K respectively.For any rational prime p and any l ≥ 1, let k l (p) be the number of prime factors of p in K that have the inertial degree equal to l and k l (p) be the number of prime factors of p in K that have the inertial degree equal to l.Clearly, for every prime p, only finitely many numbers k l (p) and k l (p) are nonzero.K and K are called: (A) arithmetically equivalent if for almost all rational primes p, g K (p) = g K (p) and f i (p) = f i (p) for all i = 1, . . ., r (as usual, \"for almost all\" means for all except possibly a set of primes of Dirichlet density zero);(S) split equivalent if for almost all rational primes p, g K (p) = g K (p); (SK) super Kronecker equivalent if for almost all rational primes p, k 1 (p) = k 1 (p);(K) Kronecker equivalent if for almost all rational primes p, k 1 (p) > 0 iff k 1 (p) > 0;(WK) weakly Kronecker equivalent if for almost all rational primes p,Here are the logical connections between these concepts ([2-5, 8]):(SK) ⇔ (S) ⇔ (A) ⇒ (K) ⇒ (WK) (the last two implications cannot be reversed).",

    "abstract": "The Schinzel hypothesis claims (but it seems hopeless to prove) that any irreducible Q[x] polynomial without a constant factor assumes infinitely many prime values at integer places. On the other hand, it is easy to see that a reducible Q[x] polynomial can have only finitely many such places. In this paper we prove that a reducible Z[x] polynomial of degree n (where n is not 4 or 5) can have at most n+2 such places, and there exist examples with n+1 places. If the Schinzel hypothesis and the k-prime-tuple conjecture are true, then there are also polynomials with n+2 such places. (For n=4 or 5 the maximum possible value is 8.) If a Z[x] polynomial is the product of two non-constant integer-valued Q[x] polynomials, then there are at most 1.87234...n+o(n) such places. Even in this case, the number of integer places with positive prime values is at most n. More generally, if f=gh \\in R[x] is a product of two non-constant real polynomials, then the number of real places x such that |g(x)|=1 or |h(x)=1|, while f(x)>1, is at most n. For a natural complex version of this last statement we give a counterexample. Furthermore, we briefly consider the generalized problem of assuming values in a fixed finite set of integers.",

This provides a new strategy to prove this conjecture of Wilkie.

    "abstract": "Introduction. Several authors have developed the theory of lifting from the space of modular forms of one variable to that of modular forms on the orthogonal groups attached to quadratic forms over Q (cf. [1, 4–6, 8]). Shimura [9], [10] dealt with the problem of construction of arithmetic modular forms on orthogonal groups over totally real algebraic number fields. However, he did not take up the explicit calculation of the Fourier coefficients of lifted modular forms. On the other hand, in [3], [4] we have established a correspondence Ψ k between the space S(2k−1)/2(M,χ) of modular cusp forms of half integral weight (2k − 1)/2 of level M to the space M (2) k (M,χ) of Maass forms of Siegel modular cusp forms of degree two of weight k of level M in such a way that it commutes with the actions of Hecke operators. We evaluated explicitly the Fourier coefficients of Ψ k (f) with a form f in S(2k−1)/2(M,χ), and made clear a coincidence with Shimura’s zeta functions attached to f and Andrianov’s zeta functions attached to Ψ k (f). We note that these results are closely related to Saito–Kurokawa’s conjecture concerning Siegel modular forms of degree two. Using the technique in the theory of group representation of Jacquet and Langlands, PiatetskiShapiro [7] discussed Saito–Kurokawa’s conjecture in the case of Siegel modular forms on GpSp(2, AF ) where AF is the adele ring of an arbitrary number field F . Unfortunately, it seems that his approach is difficult to use for an explicit calculation of the Fourier coefficients of the lifted forms. The first purpose of the present note is to show the existence of a correspondence ΨN ′ between Hilbert modular forms f of half integral weight with respect to the principal congruence group and Hilbert–Siegel modular forms ΨN ′(f) of degree two attached to totally real number fields. The second one",

L'un des objectifs de ce travail est d'étudier les facteurs locauxde la fonction L attachée à X en les places v où il y a mauvaise réduction (Fr v = Frobenius géométrique en v, I v = inertie en v).En particulier, nous déterminons au §III l'ordre en s = 0 du pôle de L v (X, s) quand X est une surface K-3 ou encore une surface abélienne d'un certain type.L'ordre de ce pôle dépend étroitement du type de dégénérescence en v de la variété X et est liée au calcul du. Les ingrédients essentiels sont les résultats galoisiens de Jannsen [3] et les résultats de Kulikov-Shafarevich sur les dégénérescences des surfaces [5].Dans le paragraphe IV, nous globalisons les résultats précédents en calculant le H 4 et (X/k, Q l /Z l (3)) pour une surface K-3 X.

    "abstract": "In the present paper, we will give a complete affirmative answer to the l-part of Shioda’s problem ([5, Question 3.4]) on Jacobi sums J (a) l (p), and to the conjecture (F. Gouvea and N. Yui [1, Conjecture (1.9)]) which comes from Shioda’s problem and my congruences for Jacobi sums (see [3, Theorem 2]) (see Theorem 1 and its Corollary of the present paper). We retain the notation of [4], but l is any odd prime number here. Furthermore, let n be any positive integer and let ζm be a primitive mth root of unity in C for any positive integer m. Let Q be the algebraic closure of Q in C. We fix an algebraic closure Ql of Ql, and by a fixed imbedding Q ↪→ Ql we consider Q as a subfield of Ql. Let M be any finite unramified extension of Ql in Ql, and put Mn = M(ζln) and πn = ζln − 1. Then πn is a prime element of Mn. Let σ−1 ∈ G = Gal(Mn/M) (the Galois group of Mn over M) be such that ζ σ−1 ln = ζ −1 ln . Let ordMn denote the normalized additive valuation of Mn, and let Un = U(Mn) be the group of principal units in Mn: Un = U(Mn) = {x ∈Mn | ordMn(x− 1) ≥ 1}.",

    "abstract": "(1.2) e x exp{−(1/ √ 2− e) √ log x log2 x}. In 1989, Balazard and the first author [1] gave an elementary proof of (1.2). As it seldom occurs that an elementary result reaches the degree of accuracy of the best known analytic method, we may say that this elementary method is effective. Very recently we succeeded, using the same argument, in generalizing Bateman’s theorem to the case of algebraic number fields [13]. In this paper, we shall further develop this method to investigate distribution of values of Euler’s function over integers free of large prime factors. Let P (n) be the largest prime factor of the integer n > 1, with the convention that P (1) = 1. Defining, for x ≥ y ≥ 2,",

Introduction.Dans ce travail on s'intéresse à la classification des polynômes singuliers de degré 4 sur un corps fini et aux congruences modulo p 2 .Dans toute la suite K désignera un corps fini de caractéristique p à q = p a éléments, p un nombre premier impair et K une clôture algébrique de K.Cette étude s'article comme suit :• généraliser un théorème de Carlitz [2] au cas de polynômes à plusieurs variables,• démontrer aussi que pour tout entier n ≥ 9 et pour tout F ∈ K[X 1 , . . . . . ., X n ] singulier de degré 4 sans terme constant, si q ≥ 37 il existe v ∈ K non carré et g 1 , g 2 éléments de K[X 1 , . . ., X n ] de degré 2 sans termes constants tels que2 ) où ε = ±1.Ceci généralise le résultat de D. J. Lewis [5].Dans [3] on a démontré que pour tout entier d ≥ 1, il existe des nombres premiers dont la plus petite valeur, p(d), vérifie la propriété suivante : pour tout p nombre premier ≥ p(d) et pour tout F ∈ Z p [X 1 , . . ., X 2d+1 ] de degré d sans terme constant, l'équation F (x 1 , . . ., x 2d+1 ) ≡ 0 (mod p 2 ) admet une solution primitive.Il a été aussi démontré dans le même article que p(2) = 2, p(3) = 3 et que pour tout d ≥ 4 on a p(d) > 2.Cette étude va nous permettre de démontrer que 37 est un majorant de p(4). Polynômes à plusieurs variables sur un corps fini à valeursune puissance e-ième.On va commencer par énoncer le théorème de Carlitz [2].",

In [3], Honda proved that for any elliptic curve C over Q, a formal completion Ĉ of C is isomorphic over Z to a formal group whose invariant differential has the same coefficients as the zeta-function of C, and his result was generalized to abelian varieties over Q with real multiplication by Deninger and Nart in [1]. In this paper, we classify formal groups which are obtained from some L-series associated with symmetric powers. Let p be a rational prime and let ap be a rational integer. Let Qp and Zp denote the field of p-adic numbers and the ring of p-adic integers, respectively. Consider an equation",
