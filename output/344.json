    "abstract": "A coronavirus (HCoV-19) has caused the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan, China. Preventing and reversing the cytokine storm may be the key to save the patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to possess a comprehensive powerful immunomodulatory function. This study aims to investigate whether MSC transplantation improves the outcome of 7 enrolled patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Beijing YouAn Hospital, China, from Jan 23, 2020 to Feb 16, 2020. The clinical outcomes, as well as changes of inflammatory and immune function levels and adverse effects of 7 enrolled patients were assessed for 14 days after MSC injection. MSCs could cure or significantly improve the functional outcomes of seven patients without observed adverse effects. The pulmonary function and symptoms of these seven patients were significantly improved in 2 days after MSC transplantation. Among them, two common and one severe patient were recovered and discharged in 10 days after treatment. After treatment, the peripheral lymphocytes were increased, the C-reactive protein decreased, and the overactivated cytokine-secreting immune cells CXCR3+CD4+ T cells, CXCR3+CD8+ T cells, and CXCR3+ NK cells disappeared in 3-6 days. In addition, a group of CD14+CD11c+CD11b<sup>mid</sup> regulatory DC cell population dramatically increased. Meanwhile, the level of TNF-α was significantly decreased, while IL-10 increased in MSC treatment group compared to the placebo control group. Furthermore, the gene expression profile showed MSCs were ACE2<sup>-</sup> and TMPRSS2<sup>-</sup> which indicated MSCs are free from COVID-19 infection. Thus, the intravenous transplantation of MSCs was safe and effective for treatment in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for the patients in critically severe condition.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is defined as an imbalance between production of free radicals and reactive metabolites or [reactive oxygen species (ROS)] and their elimination by through protective mechanisms, including (antioxidants). This Such imbalance leads to damage of cells and important biomolecules and cells, with hence posing a potential adverse impact on the whole organism. At the center of the day-to-day biological response to oxidative stress is the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) - nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)- antioxidant response elements (ARE) pathway, which regulates the transcription of many several antioxidant genes that preserve cellular homeostasis and detoxification genes that process and eliminate carcinogens and toxins before they can cause damage. The redox-sensitive signaling system Keap1/Nrf2/ARE plays a key role in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis under stress, inflammatory, carcinogenic, and pro-apoptotic conditions, which allows us to consider it as a pharmacological target. Herein, we review and discuss the recent advancements in the regulation of the Keap1/Nrf2/ARE system, and its role under physiological and pathophysiological conditions, e.g. such as in exercise, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, stroke, liver and kidney system, etc. and such.",

One of the defects in metabolic syndrome and its associated diseases is excess of reactive oxygen species. Reactive oxygen species generated by mitochondria, or from other sites within or outside the cell, cause damage to mitochondrial components and initiate degradative processes. Such toxic reactions contribute significantly to the aging process.

    "abstract": "Age-associated chronic inflammation is characterized by unresolved and uncontrolled inflammation with multivariable low-grade, chronic and systemic responses that exacerbate the aging process and age-related chronic diseases. Currently, there are two major hypotheses related to the involvement of chronic inflammation in the aging process: molecular inflammation of aging and inflammaging. However, neither of these hypotheses satisfactorily addresses age-related chronic inflammation, considering the recent advances that have been made in inflammation research. A more comprehensive view of age-related inflammation, that has a scope beyond the conventional view, is therefore required. In this review, we discuss newly emerging data on multi-phase inflammatory networks and proinflammatory pathways as they relate to aging. We describe the age-related upregulation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling, cytokines/chemokines, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, inflammasome, and lipid accumulation. The later sections of this review present our expanded view of age-related senescent inflammation, a process we term \"senoinflammation\", that we propose here as a novel concept. As described in the discussion, senoinflammation provides a schema highlighting the important and ever-increasing roles of proinflammatory senescence-associated secretome, inflammasome, ER stress, TLRs, and microRNAs, which support the senoinflammation concept. It is hoped that this new concept of senoinflammation opens wider and deeper avenues for basic inflammation research and provides new insights into the anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies targeting the multiple proinflammatory pathways and mediators and mediators that underlie the pathophysiological aging process.",

At the same time, astrocytes can participate in the inflammatory response and play a key role in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Reactive astrocytes are strongly induced by numerous pathological conditions in the CNS. Astrocyte reactivity is initially characterized by hypertrophy of soma and processes, triggered by different molecules. Recent studies have demonstrated that neuroinflammation and ischemia can elicit two different types of reactive astrocytes, termed A1s and A2s. However, in the case of astrocyte reactivity in different neurodegenerative diseases, the recently published research issues remain a high level of conflict and controversy. So far, we still know very little about whether and how the function or reactivity of astrocytes changes in the progression of different neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we aimed to briefly discuss recent studies highlighting the complex contribution of astrocytes in the process of various neurodegenerative diseases, which may provide us with new prospects for the development of an excellent therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases.",

Due to advances in health care, hygiene control and food availability, life expectancy is increasing and the population in most developed countries is shifting to an increasing proportion of people at a cancer susceptible age. Mechanisms of aging are also found to occur in carcinogenesis, albeit with shared or divergent end-results. It is now clear that aging and cancer development either share or diverge in several disease mechanisms. Such mechanisms include the role of genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic changes, loss of proteostasis, decreased nutrient sensing and altered metabolism, but also cellular senescence and stem cell function. Cancer cells and aged cells are also fundamentally opposite, as cancer cells can be thought of as hyperactive cells with advantageous mutations, rapid cell division and increased energy consumption, while aged cells are hypoactive with accumulated disadvantageous mutations, cell division inability and a decreased ability for energy production and consumption. Nonetheless, aging and cancer are tightly interconnected and many of the same strategies and drugs may be used to target both, while in other cases antagonistic pleiotrophy come into effect and inhibition of one can be the activation of the other. Cancer can be considered an aging disease, though the shared mechanisms underpinning the two processes remain unclear. Better understanding of the shared and divergent pathways of aging and cancer is needed.",

In order to explore the effects of comorbid chronic diseases on clinical outcomes of COVID-19, a search was conducted in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CDC, and NIH databases to April 25, 2020. A total of 24 peer-reviewed articles, including 10948 COVID-19 cases were selected. We found diabetes was present in 10.0%, coronary artery disease/cardiovascular disease (CAD/CVD) was in 8.0%, and hypertension was in 20.0%, which were much higher than that of chronic pulmonary disease (3.0%). Specifically, preexisting chronic conditions are strongly correlated with disease severity [Odds ratio (OR) 3.50, 95% CI 1.78 to 6.90], and being admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) (OR 3.36, 95% CI 1.67 to 6.76); in addition, compared to COVID-19 patients with no preexisting chronic diseases, COVID-19 patients who present with either diabetes, hypertension, CAD/CVD, or chronic pulmonary disease have a higher risk of developing severe disease, with an OR of 2.61 (95% CI 1.93 to 3.52), 2.84 (95% CI 2.22 to 3.63), 4.18 (95% CI 2.87 to 6.09) and 3.83 (95% CI 2.15 to 6.80), respectively.

Taken together, cardio-metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension and CAD/CVD were more common than chronic pulmonary disease in COVID-19 patients, however, each comorbid disease was correlated with increased disease severity.

Therefore, attention should be paid to the management of under nutrition in the general elderly population by improving energy intake and maintaining muscle mass.

    "abstract": "Dizziness and imbalance are amongst the most common complaints in older people, and are a growing public health concern since they put older people at a significantly higher risk of falling. Although the causes of dizziness in older people are multifactorial, peripheral vestibular dysfunction is one of the most frequent causes. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is the most frequent form of vestibular dysfunction in the elderly, followed by Meniere#cod#x02019;s disease. Every factor associated with the maintenance of postural stability deteriorates during aging. Age-related deterioration of peripheral vestibular function has been demonstrated through quantitative measurements of the vestibulo-ocular reflex with rotational testing and of the vestibulo-collic reflex with testing of vestibular evoked myogenic potentials. Age-related decline of vestibular function has been shown to correlate with the age-related decrease in the number of vestibular hair cells and neurons. The mechanism of age-related cellular loss in the vestibular endorgan is unclear, but it is thought that genetic predisposition and cumulative effect of oxidative stress may both play an important role. Since the causes of dizziness in older people are multi-factorial, management of this disease should be customized according to the etiologies of each individual. Vestibular rehabilitation is found to be effective in treating both unilateral and bilateral vestibular dysfunction. Various prosthetic devices have also been developed to improve postural balance in older people. Although there have been no medical treatments improving age-related vestibular dysfunction, new medical treatments such as mitochondrial antioxidants or caloric restriction, which have been effective in preventing age-related hearing loss, should be ienvestigated in the future.",

    "abstract": "Glycation is both a physiological and pathological process which mainly affects proteins, nucleic acids and lipids. Exogenous and endogenous glycation produces deleterious reactions that take place principally in the extracellular matrix environment or within the cell cytosol and organelles. Advanced glycation end product (AGE) formation begins by the non-enzymatic glycation of free amino groups by sugars and aldehydes which leads to a succession of rearrangements of intermediate compounds and ultimately to irreversibly bound products known as AGEs. Epigenetic factors, oxidative stress, UV and nutrition are important causes of the accumulation of chemically and structurally different AGEs with various biological reactivities. Cross-linked proteins, deriving from the glycation process, present both an altered structure and function. Nucleotides and lipids are particularly vulnerable targets which can in turn favor DNA mutation or a decrease in cell membrane integrity and associated biological pathways respectively. In mitochondria, the consequences of glycation can alter bioenergy production. Under physiological conditions, anti-glycation defenses are sufficient, with proteasomes preventing accumulation of glycated proteins, while lipid turnover clears glycated products and nucleotide excision repair removes glycated nucleotides. If this does not occur, glycation damage accumulates, and pathologies may develop. Glycation-induced biological products are known to be mainly associated with aging, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes and its complications, atherosclerosis, renal failure, immunological changes, retinopathy, skin photoaging, osteoporosis, and progression of some tumors.",

Frailty is an age-associated biological syndrome characterized by decreases in the biological functional reserve and resistance to stressors due to changes in several physiological systems, which puts older individuals at special risk of disability. To counteract the neuromuscular and cardiovascular declines associated with aging, as well as to prevent and treat the frailty syndrome, the strength and endurance training seems to be an effective strategy to improve muscle hypertrophy, strength and power output, as well as endurance performance. The first purpose of this review was discuss the neuromuscular adaptations to strength training, as well as the cardiovascular adaptations to endurance training in healthy and frail elderly subjects. In addition, the second purpose of this study was investigate the concurrent training adaptations in the elderly. Based on the results found, the combination of strength and endurance training (i.e., concurrent training) performed at moderate volume and moderate to high intensity in elderly populations is the most effective way to improve both neuromuscular and cardiorespiratory functions. Moreover, exercise interventions that include muscle power training should be prescribed to frail elderly in order to improve the overall physical status of this population and prevent disability.",

    "abstract": "The source of dietary nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub>) is mainly green, leafy vegetables, partially absorbed into blood through intestinal mucosa. The recycled nitrate is reabsorbed and concentrated by the salivary glands and then secreted into saliva. In 2012, sialin was first discovered as the mammalian membrane nitrate transporter in salivary glands and plays a key role in circulation of inorganic nitrate, providing a scientific basis for further investigation into the circulation and functions of nitrate. Dietary nitrate can be converted to nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub>) by oral commensal bacteria under the tongue or in the stomach, following which nitrite is converted to nitric oxide (NO) through non-enzymatic synthesis. Previously, nitrate and nitrite were thought to be carcinogenic due to the potential formation of nitrogen compounds, whereas the beneficial functions of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>-NO pathway were ignored. Under conditions of hypoxia and ischemia, the production of endogenous NO from L-arginine is inhibited, while the activity of exogenous NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>-NO is enhanced. Recently, a greater amount of evidence has shown that nitrate and nitrite serve as a reservoir and perform positive biological NO-like functions. Therefore, exogenous dietary nitrate plays an important role in various physiological activities as an effective supplement of nitrite and NO in human body. Here we generally review the source, circulation and bio-functions of dietary nitrate.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of cholinergic neurons, leading to the onset of severe behavioral, motor and cognitive impairments. It is a pressing public health problem with no effective treatment. Existing therapies only provide symptomatic relief without being able to prevent, stop or reverse the pathologic process. While the molecular basis underlying this multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder remains a significant challenge, mitochondrial dysfunction appears to be a critical factor in the pathogenesis of this disease. It is therefore important to target mitochondrial dysfunction in the prodromal phase of AD to slow or prevent the neurodegenerative process and restore neuronal function. In this review, we discuss mechanisms of action and translational potential of current mitochondrial and bioenergetic therapeutics for AD including: mitochondrial enhancers to potentiate energy production; antioxidants to scavenge reactive oxygen species and reduce oxidative damage; glucose metabolism and substrate supply; and candidates that target apoptotic and mitophagy pathways to remove damaged mitochondria. While mitochondrial therapeutic strategies have shown promise at the preclinical stage, there has been little progress in clinical trials thus far.",

Baicalin and its aglycon baicalein are flavonoids extracted from <i>Scutellaria baicalensis</i>, an important traditional Chinese herb. In recent years, a growing body of evidences has shown that baicalin and baicalein could be effective in the treatment of cerebral ischemia. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that baicalin could penetrate the blood-brain barrier and distribute in cerebral nuclei. Through a variety of <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> models of ischemic neuronal injury, numerous studies have demonstrated that baicalin and baicalein have salutary effect for neuroprotection. Especially, the studies on the pharmacological mechanism showed that baicalin and baicalein have several pharmacological activities, which include antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory and anti-excitotoxicity effects, protection of the mitochondria, promoting neuronal protective factors expression and adult neurogenesis effects and many more. This review focuses on the neuroprotective effects of baicalin and baicalein in ischemia or stroke-induced neuronal cell death. We aimed at collecting all important information regarding the neuroprotective effect and its pharmacological mechanism of baicalin and baicalein in various <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> experimental models of ischemic neuronal injury.",

This study intended to investigate the role of lncRNA H19 and H19 gene variation in cerebral I/R injury with focusing on its relationship with autophagy activation. Cerebral I/R was induced in rats by middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by reperfusion. SH-SY5Y cells were subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) to simulate I/R injury. Real-time PCR, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence and Western blot were used to evaluate the level of lncRNA H19, apoptosis, autophagy and some related proteins. The modified multiple ligase reaction was used to analyze the gene polymorphism of six SNPs in H19, rs217727, rs2067051, rs2251375, rs492994, rs2839698 and rs10732516 in ischemic stroke patients. We found that the expression of lncRNA H19 was upregulated by cerebral I/R in rats, as well as by OGD/R in vitro in the cells. Inhibition of lncRNA H19 and autophagy protected cells from OGD/R-induced death, respectively. Autophagy activation induced by OGD/R was prevented by H19 siRNA. Autophagy inducer, rapamycin, abolished lncRNA H19 effect. Furthermore, we found that lncRNA H19 inhibited autophagy through DUSP5-ERK1/2 axis. The result from blood samples of ischemic patients revealed that the variation of H19 gene increased the risk of ischemic stroke. Taken together, the results of present study suggest that LncRNA H19 could be a new therapeutic target of ischemic stroke.",

    "abstract": "Skin cancer is a worldwide, emerging clinical need in the elderly white population, with a steady increase in incidence rates, morbidity and related medical costs. Skin cancer is a heterogeneous group of cancers comprising cutaneous melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC), which predominantly affect elderly patients, aged older than 65 years. Melanoma has distinct clinical presentations in the elderly patient and represents a challenging question in terms of clinical management. NMSC includes the basal cell carcinoma and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and presents a wide disease spectrum in the elderly population, ranging from low-risk to high-risk tumours, advanced and inoperable disease. Treatment decisions for NMSC are preferentially based on tumour characteristics, patient’s chronological age and physician’s preferences and operational settings. Several treatment options are available for NMSC, from surgery to non-invasive/medical therapies, but patient-based factors, such as geriatric comorbidities and patient’s life expectancy, do not frequently modulate treatment goals. In melanoma, age-related variations in clinical management are significant and may frequently lead to under-treatment, limiting access to advanced surgical and medical treatments. Clinical decision-making in the care of elderly skin cancer patient should ideally implement a geriatric assessment, prioritizing patient-based factors and efficiently differentiating fit from frail cancer patients. Current clinical practice guidelines for NMSC and melanoma only partially address geriatric aspects of cancer care, such as frailty, limited life-expectancy, geriatric comorbidities and treatment compliance. We review the recent evidence on the scope and problem of skin cancer in the elderly population as well as age-related variations in its clinical management, highlighting the potential role of a geriatric approach in optimizing dermato-oncological care.",

    "abstract": "There has been increasing interest and research into sarcopenia in community-dwelling older adults since the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) agreed a consensus definition in 2010. Sarcopenia has been defined as loss of muscle mass with loss of muscle function (strength or physical performance), with measurements two Standard Deviations (SDs) below the mean of a young reference population. This definition does not necessitate longitudinal measurements, or the absence of acute illness and diagnosis can be made from single measurements. We hypothesise that hospitalisation, due to a combination of acute inflammatory burden and muscle disuse, leads to an acute decline in muscle mass and function and may lead to some individuals meeting criteria for sarcopenia, acutely, based on the EWGSOP definition. This may be partially recoverable or may lead to increased risk of developing sarcopenia long-term. We have denoted the term “acute sarcopenia” to refer to acute loss of muscle mass and function associated with hospitalisation. This review discusses some of the current available research in this context and also identifies some of the knowledge gaps and potential areas for future research.",

This phenomenon, referred to as accelerated pathological remodeling of arterial wall, could be attributed to traditional risk factors associated with atherosclerosis. Several new non-invasive techniques have been used to study arterial wall's structural and functional alterations. These techniques (based of Radio Frequency, RF) allow for an assessment of artery age through calculations of intima-media thickness (RF- QIMT), pulse wave rate (RF- QAS) and endothelial dysfunction degree (FMD). The inflammatory and autoimmune diseases should now be considered as new cardiovascular risk factors, result of the major consequences of oxidative stress and RAS (Renin Angiotensin System) imbalance associated with the deleterious effect of known risk factors that lead to the alteration of the arterial wall. Inflammation plays a key role in all stages of the formation of vascular lesions maintained and exacerbated by the risk factors. The consequence of chronic inflammation is endothelial dysfunction that sets in and we can define it as an integrated marker of the damage to arterial walls by classic risk factors. The atherosclerosis, which develops among these patients, is the main cause for cardiovascular morbi-mortality and uncontrolled chronic biological inflammation, which quickly favors endothelial dysfunction. These inflammatory and autoimmune diseases should now be considered as new cardiovascular risk factors.",

However, acute sarcopenia occurs in survivors of COVID-19; older adults and the most critically unwell patients are the most at risk. Acute sarcopenia is an under-recognised condition of acute muscle insufficiency, defined by declines in muscle function and/or quantity within six months, usually following a stressor event. This commentary reviews definition and mechanisms of acute sarcopenia in COVID-19 and suggests recommendations for research and clinical practice. Research should now focus on the longer-term consequences of acute sarcopenia in patients who have suffered from COVID-19. At the same time, clinicians need to be increasingly aware of the condition, and measurements of muscle strength, quantity, and physical performance should be embedded into clinical practice. Clinicians should consider the risks of acute sarcopenia when weighing up the risks and benefits of treatment (e.g. dexamethasone), and instigate multidisciplinary treatment including dietetics input.",

    "abstract": "Iron is an essential component in many biological processes in the human body. It is critical for the visual phototransduction cascade in the retina. However, excess iron can be toxic. Iron accumulation and reduced efficiency of intracellular antioxidative defense systems predispose the aging retina to oxidative stress-induced cell death. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is characterized by retinal iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation. The mechanisms underlying AMD include oxidative stress-mediated death of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells and subsequent death of retinal photoreceptors. Understanding the mechanism of the disruption of iron and redox homeostasis in the aging retina and AMD is crucial to decipher these mechanisms of cell death and AMD pathogenesis. The mechanisms of retinal cell death in AMD are an area of active investigation; previous studies have proposed several types of cell death as major mechanisms. Ferroptosis, a newly discovered programmed cell death pathway, has been associated with the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases. Ferroptosis is initiated by lipid peroxidation and is characterized by iron-dependent accumulation. In this review, we provide an overview of the mechanisms of iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation in the aging retina and AMD, with an emphasis on ferroptosis.",

    "abstract": "Alveolar epithelial cell damage is an important determinant of the severity of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS). However, the molecular mechanisms of alveolar epithelial death during the development of ALI/ARDS remain unclear. In this study, we explore the role of miR-29a-3p in ALI/ARDS and its molecular mechanism. Plasma samples were collected from healthy controls and ARDS patients. Mice were intratracheally instilled with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to establish acute lung injury. N6-adenosine (m6A) quantification, RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation, cell viability assay, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and western blotting were performed. We found that miR-29a-3p was down-regulated in plasma of ARDS patients and lung tissue of ALI model mice, and miR-29a-3p agomir injection down-regulated the levels of the inflammatory factors, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the lungs, reducing alveolar epithelial cell PANoptosis as evaluated by the downregulation of Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1), gasdermin D (GSDMD), caspase-3, caspase-8, and mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL), ultimately improving lung injury in the ALI model mice. Mechanism studies demonstrated that the knockout of methyltransferase 3 (N6-adenosine-methyltransferase complex catalytic subunit) removed the m6A modification of miR-29a-3p and reduced miR-29a-3p expression. Our findings suggest that miR-29a-3p is a potential target that can be manipulated for ALI/ARDS.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation aging clocks have become an invaluable tool in biogerontology research since their inception in 2013. Today, a variety of machine learning approaches have been tested for the purpose of predicting human age based on molecular-level features. Among these, deep learning, or neural networks, is an especially promising approach that has been used to construct accurate clocks using blood biochemistry, transcriptomics, and microbiomics data—feats unachieved by other algorithms. In this article, we explore how deep learning performs in a DNA methylation setting and compare it to the current industry standard—the 353 CpG clock published in 2013. The aging clock we are presenting (DeepMAge) is a neural network regressor trained on 4,930 blood DNA methylation profiles from 17 studies. Its absolute median error was 2.77 years in an independent verification set of 1,293 samples from 15 studies. DeepMAge shows biological relevance by assigning a higher predicted age to people with various health-related conditions, such as ovarian cancer, irritable bowel diseases, and multiple sclerosis.",

It accounts for approximately 60-70% of all dementia cases worldwide. With the increasing number of AD patients, elucidating underlying mechanisms and developing corresponding interventional strategies are necessary. Hypotheses about AD such as amyloid cascade, Tau hyper-phosphorylation, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, cholinergic, and vascular hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and all of them play a certain role in the development of AD. The amyloid cascade hypothesis is currently the most widely studied; however, other hypotheses are also gaining support. This article summarizes the recent evidence regarding major pathological hypotheses of AD and their potential interplay, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of each hypothesis and their implications for the development of effective treatments. This could stimulate further studies and promote the development of more effective therapeutic strategies for AD.",

In this review, we elaborate on the specific substrates and molecular mechanisms of SIRT6 in various physiological and pathological processes in detail, emphasizing its links to aging (genomic damage, telomere integrity, DNA repair), metabolism (glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, insulin secretion and lipid synthesis, lipolysis, thermogenesis), inflammation and cardiovascular diseases (atherosclerosis, cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, ischemia-reperfusion injury).

    "abstract": "Astrocytes play an essential role in the modulation of blood-brain barrier function. Neurological diseases induce the transformation of astrocytes into a neurotoxic A1 phenotype, exacerbating brain injury. However, the effect of A1 astrocytes on the BBB dysfunction after stroke is unknown. Adult male ICR mice (n=97) were subjected to 90-minute transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Immunohistochemical staining of A1 (C3d) and A2 (S100A10) was performed to characterize phenotypic changes in astrocytes over time after tMCAO. The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist semaglutide was intraperitoneally injected into mice to inhibit A1 astrocytes. Infarct volume, atrophy volume, neurobehavioral outcomes, and BBB permeability were evaluated. RNA-seq was adopted to explore the potential targets and signaling pathways of A1 astrocyte-induced BBB dysfunction. Astrocytic C3d expression was increased, while expression of S100A10 was decreased in the first two weeks after tMCAO, reflecting a shift in the astrocytic phenotype. Semaglutide treatment reduced the expression of CD16/32 in microglia and C3d in astrocytes after ischemic stroke (p<0.05). Ischemia-induced brain infarct volume, atrophy volume and neuroinflammation were reduced in the semaglutide-treated mice, and neurobehavioral outcomes were improved compared to control mice (p<0.05). We further demonstrated that semaglutide treatment reduced the gap formation of tight junction proteins ZO-1, claudin-5 and occludin, as well as IgG leakage three days following tMCAO (p<0.05). In vitro experiments revealed that A1 astrocyte-conditioned medium disrupted BBB integrity. RNA-seq showed that A1 astrocytes were enriched in inflammatory factors and chemokines and significantly modulated the TNF and chemokine signaling pathways, which are closely related to barrier damage. We concluded that astrocytes undergo a phenotypic shift over time after ischemic stroke. C3d+/GFAP+ astrocytes aggravate BBB disruption, suggesting that inhibiting C3d+/GFAP+ astrocyte formation represents a novel strategy for the treatment of ischemic stroke.",

    "abstract": "Fibrosis is the abnormal accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen and fibronectin. Aging, injury, infections, and inflammation can cause different types of tissue fibrosis. Numerous clinical investigations have shown a correlation between the degree of liver and pulmonary fibrosis in patients and telomere length and mitochondrial DNA content, both of which are signs of aging. Aging involves the gradual loss of tissue function over time, which results in the loss of homeostasis and, ultimately, an organism's fitness. A major feature of aging is the accumulation of senescent cells. Senescent cells abnormally and continuously accumulate in the late stages of life, contributing to age-related fibrosis and tissue deterioration, among other aging characteristics. Furthermore, aging generates chronic inflammation, which results in fibrosis and decreases organ function. This finding suggests that fibrosis and aging are closely related. The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily plays a crucial role in the physiological and pathological processes of aging, immune regulation, atherosclerosis, and tissue fibrosis. In this review, the functions of TGF-β in normal organs, aging, and fibrotic tissues is discussed: TGF-β signalling is altered with age and is an indicator of pathology associated with tissue fibrosis. In addition, this review discusses the potential targeting of noncoding.",

Cellular senescence is a hallmark of aging that is defined by a stable exit from the cell cycle in response to cellular damage and stress. The potential mechanisms underlying glaucomatous cellular senescence include oxidative stress, DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, defective autophagy/mitophagy, and epigenetic modifications. These phenotypes interact and generate a sufficiently stable network to maintain the cell senescent state. Senescent trabecular meshwork (TM) cells, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and vascular endothelial cells reportedly accumulate with age and stress and may contribute to glaucoma pathologies. Therapies targeting the suppression or elimination of senescent cells have been found to ameliorate RGC death and improve vision in glaucoma models, suggesting the pivotal role of cellular senescence in the pathophysiology of glaucoma. In this review, we explore the biological links between aging and glaucoma, specifically delving into cellular senescence. Moreover, we summarize the current data on cellular senescence in key target cells associated with the development and clinical phenotypes of glaucoma. Finally, we discuss the therapeutic potential of targeting cellular senescence for the management of glaucoma.",

We retrospectively reviewed the records of 203 patients on the AD continuum and 82 healthy controls who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging and <sup>18</sup>F-florbetaben positron emission tomography. Automatic segmentation was performed, and the CPV was calculated. Cognitive function was assessed using detailed neuropsychological tests, and patients on the AD continuum were categorized into the non-dementia and dementia groups.

This neurodegenerative disease is mainly characterized by amyloid-beta (Aβ) and phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) accumulation in the brains of patients with AD and increasing evidence suggests that these are key biomarkers in AD. Both Aβ and p-tau can be detected through various imaging techniques (such as positron emission tomography, PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. The presence of these biomarkers in individuals, who are asymptomatic or have mild cognitive impairment can indicate an increased risk of developing AD in the future. Furthermore, the combination of Aβ and p-tau biomarkers is often used for more accurate diagnosis and prediction of AD progression. Along with AD being a neurodegenerative disease, it is associated with other chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, depression, and diabetes because studies have shown that these comorbid conditions make people more vulnerable to AD. In the first part of this review, we discuss that biofluid-based biomarkers such as Aβ, p-Tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and Aβ & p-Tau in plasma could be used as an alternative sensitive technique to diagnose AD.

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease and other dementias as well as Parkinson's disease, are emerging as profoundly significant challenges and burdens to global health, a trend highlighted by the most recent Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 studies. This growing impact is closely linked to the demographic shift toward an aging population and the potential long-term repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic, both of which have intensified the prevalence and severity of these conditions. In this review, we explore several critical aspects of this complex issue, including the increasing global burden of neurodegenerative diseases, unmet medical and social needs within current care systems, the unique and amplified challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and potential strategies for enhancing healthcare policy and practice. We underscore the urgent need for cohesive, multidisciplinary approaches across medical, research, and policy domains to effectively address the increasing burden of neurodegenerative diseases, thereby improving the quality of life for patients and their caregivers.",

    "abstract": "Pharmacological studies have indirectly shown that necroptosis participates in ischemic neuronal death. However, its mechanism has yet to be elucidated in the ischemic brain. TNFα-triggered RIPK1 kinase activation could initiate RIPK3/MLKL-mediated necroptosis under inhibition of caspase-8. In the present study, we performed middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) to induce cerebral ischemia in rats and used immunoblotting and immunostaining combined with pharmacological analysis to study the mechanism of necroptosis in ischemic brains. In the ipsilateral hemisphere, we found that ischemia induced the increase of (i) RIPK1 phosphorylation at the Ser166 residue (p-RIPK1), representing active RIPK1 kinase and (ii) the number of cells that were double stained with P-RIPK1 (Ser166) (p-RIPK1+) and TUNEL, a label of DNA double-strand breaks, indicating cell death. Furthermore, ischemia induced activation of downstream signaling factors of RIPK1, RIPK3 and MLKL, as well as the formation of mature interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Treatment with necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), an inhibitor of necroptosis, significantly decreased ischemia-induced increase of p-RIPK1 expression and p-RIPK1+ neurons, which showed protection from brain damage. Meanwhile, Nec-1 reduced RIPK3, MLKL and p-MLKL expression levels and mature IL-1β formation in Nec-1 treated ischemic brains. Our results clearly demonstrated that phosphorylation of RIPK1 at the Ser166 residue was involved in the pathogenesis of necroptosis in the brains after ischemic injury. Nec-1 treatment protected brains against ischemic necroptosis by reducing the activation of RIPK1 and inhibiting its downstream signaling pathways. These results provide direct in vivo evidence that phosphorylated RIPK1 (Ser 166) plays an important role in the initiation of RIPK3/MLKL-dependent necroptosis in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke in the rodent brain.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in individuals over 65 years of age and is characterized by accumulation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) and tau. Both Aβ and tau alter synaptic plasticity, leading to synapse loss, neural network dysfunction, and eventually neuron loss. However, the exact mechanism by which these proteins cause neurodegeneration is still not clear. A growing body of evidence suggests perturbations in the glutamatergic tripartite synapse, comprised of a presynaptic terminal, a postsynaptic spine, and an astrocytic process, may underlie the pathogenic mechanisms of AD. Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and plays an important role in learning and memory, but alterations in glutamatergic signaling can lead to excitotoxicity. This review discusses the ways in which both beta-amyloid (Aβ) and tau act alone and in concert to perturb synaptic functioning of the tripartite synapse, including alterations in glutamate release, astrocytic uptake, and receptor signaling. Particular emphasis is given to the role of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) as a possible convergence point for Aβ and tau toxicity.",

Exercise treatment has been the most commonly used intervention among elderly populations. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the available literature related to the effects of exercise interventions/programs on muscle mass, muscle strength and physical performance in older adults with sarcopenia. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE and the Web of Science for randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials exploring exercise in older adults with sarcopenia published through July 2019 without any language restrictions. Pooled analyses were conducted using Review Manager 5.3, with standardized mean differences (SMDs) and fixed-effect models. A total of 3898 titles and abstracts were initially identified, and 22 studies (1041 individuals, 80.75% females, mean age ranged from 60.51 to 85.90 years) were included in the meta-analysis.

The mechanism of pyroptosis is significantly different from other forms of cell death in its morphological and biochemical features. Pyroptosis is characterized by the activation of two different types of caspase enzymes-caspase-1 and caspase-4/5/11, and by the occurrence of a proinflammatory cytokine cascade and an immune response. Pyroptosis participates in the immune defense mechanisms against intracellular bacterial infections. On the other hand, excessive inflammasome activation can induce sterile inflammation and eventually cause some diseases, such as acute or chronic hepatitis and liver fibrosis. The mechanism and biological significance of this novel form of cell death in different liver diseases will be evaluated in this review. Specifically, we will focus on the role of pyroptosis in alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, as well as in liver failure. Finally, the therapeutic implications of pyroptosis in liver diseases will be discussed.",

Much research has been dedicated to evaluating the effects of polymorphism in the past decade, and functional effects of this genetic variation. A better understanding of how this naturally occurring polymorphism associates with or influences physiology, anatomy, and cognition in both healthy and diseased adults in neurodegenerative conditions will help understand neurochemical mechanisms and definable clinical outcomes in humans.

    "abstract": "The prevalence of age-related diseases is in an upward trend due to increased life expectancy in humans. Age-related conditions are among the leading causes of morbidity and death worldwide currently. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find apt interventions that slow down aging and reduce or postpone the incidence of debilitating age-related diseases. This review discusses the efficacy of emerging anti-aging approaches for maintaining better health in old age. There are many anti-aging strategies in development, which include procedures such as augmentation of autophagy, elimination of senescent cells, transfusion of plasma from young blood, intermittent fasting, enhancement of adult neurogenesis, physical exercise, antioxidant intake, and stem cell therapy. Multiple pre-clinical studies suggest that administration of autophagy enhancers, senolytic drugs, plasma from young blood, drugs that enhance neurogenesis and BDNF are promising approaches to sustain normal health during aging and also to postpone age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Stem cell therapy has also shown promise for improving regeneration and function of the aged or Alzheimer's disease brain. Several of these approaches are awaiting critical appraisal in clinical trials to determine their long-term efficacy and possible adverse effects. On the other hand, procedures such as intermittent fasting, physical exercise, intake of antioxidants such as resveratrol and curcumin have shown considerable promise for improving function in aging, some of which are ready for large-scale clinical trials, as they are non-invasive, and seem to have minimal side effects. In summary, several approaches are at the forefront of becoming mainstream therapies for combating aging and postponing age-related diseases in the coming years.",

The concept of homeodynamic space can be a useful one in order to identify a set of measurable, evidence-based and demonstratable parameters of health, robustness and resilience. Age-induced health problems, for which there are no other clear-cut causative agents, may be better tackled by focusing on health mechanisms and their maintenance, rather than only disease management and treatment.

    "abstract": "Aging is the greatest risk factor for human diseases, as it results in cellular growth arrest, impaired tissue function and metabolism, ultimately impacting life span. Two different mechanisms are thought to be primary causes of aging. One is cumulative DNA damage induced by a perpetuating cycle of oxidative stress; the other is nutrient-sensing adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and rapamycin (mTOR)/ ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) pathways. As the main bioactive component of natural Chinese medicine rhizoma coptidis (RC), berberine has recently been reported to expand life span in Drosophila melanogaster, and attenuate premature cellular senescence. Most components of RC including berberine, coptisine, palmatine, and jatrorrhizine have been found to have beneficial effects on hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia and hypertension aging-related diseases. The mechanism of these effects involves multiple cellular kinase and signaling pathways, including anti-oxidation, activation of AMPK signaling and its downstream targets, including mTOR/rpS6, Sirtuin1/ forkhead box transcription factor O3 (FOXO3), nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor-2 (Nrf2), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathways. Most of these mechanisms converge on AMPK regulation on mitochondrial oxidative stress. Therefore, such evidence supports the possibility that rhizoma coptidis, in particular berberine, is a promising anti-aging natural product, and has pharmaceutical potential in combating aging-related diseases via anti-oxidation and AMPK cellular kinase activation.",

Both DNA methylation and histone acetylation are nucleophilic processes and therefore ROS signaling through typical free radical processes, for example hydrogen atom abstraction is impossible. However, being “super-nucleophile” superoxide can participate in these reactions. Now we propose new nucleophilic mechanisms of DNA methylation and histone modification. During DNA methylation superoxide can deprotonate the cytosine molecule at C-5 position and by this accelerate the reaction of DNA with the positive-charged intermediate S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM). Superoxide can also deprotonate histone N-terminal tail lysines and accelerate the formation of their complexes with acetyl-coenzyme A (AcCoA), the supplier of acetyl groups. In cancer cells ROS enhance DNA methylation causing the silencing of tumor suppressor and antioxidant genes and enhancing the proliferation of cancer cells under condition of oxidative stress. ROS signaling in senescent cells probably causes DNA hypomethylation although there are insufficient data for such proposal.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes and its complications are caused by chronic glucotoxicity driven by persistent hyperglycemia. In this article, we review the mechanisms of diabetic glucotoxicity by focusing mainly on hyperglycemic stress and carbon stress. Mechanisms of hyperglycemic stress include reductive stress or pseudohypoxic stress caused by redox imbalance between NADH and NAD(+) driven by activation of both the polyol pathway and poly ADP ribose polymerase; the hexosamine pathway; the advanced glycation end products pathway; the protein kinase C activation pathway; and the enediol formation pathway. Mechanisms of carbon stress include excess production of acetyl-CoA that can over-acetylate a proteome and excess production of fumarate that can over-succinate a proteome; both of which can increase glucotoxicity in diabetes. For hyperglycemia stress, we also discuss the possible role of mitochondrial complex I in diabetes as this complex, in charge of NAD(+) regeneration, can make more reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of excess NADH. For carbon stress, we also discuss the role of sirtuins in diabetes as they are deacetylases that can reverse protein acetylation thereby attenuating diabetic glucotoxicity and improving glucose metabolism. It is our belief that targeting some of the stress pathways discussed in this article may provide new therapeutic strategies for treatment of diabetes and its complications.",

    "abstract": "The World health organization (WHO) declared Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a global pandemic and a severe public health crisis. Drastic measures to combat COVID-19 are warranted due to its contagiousness and higher mortality rates, specifically in the aged patient population. At the current stage, due to the lack of effective treatment strategies for COVID-19 innovative approaches need to be considered. It is well known that host cellular miRNAs can directly target both viral 3'UTR and coding region of the viral genome to induce the antiviral effect. In this study, we did <i>in silico</i> analysis of human miRNAs targeting SARS (4 isolates) and COVID-19 (29 recent isolates from different regions) genome and correlated our findings with aging and underlying conditions. We found 848 common miRNAs targeting the SARS genome and 873 common microRNAs targeting the COVID-19 genome. Out of a total of 848 miRNAs from SARS, only 558 commonly present in all COVID-19 isolates. Interestingly, 315 miRNAs are unique for COVID-19 isolates and 290 miRNAs unique to SARS. We also noted that out of 29 COVID-19 isolates, 19 isolates have identical miRNA targets. The COVID-19 isolates, Netherland (EPI_ISL_422601), Australia (EPI_ISL_413214), and Wuhan (EPI_ISL_403931) showed six, four, and four unique miRNAs targets, respectively. Furthermore, GO, and KEGG pathway analysis showed that COVID-19 targeting human miRNAs involved in various age-related signaling and diseases. Recent studies also suggested that some of the human miRNAs targeting COVID-19 decreased with aging and underlying conditions. GO and KEGG identified impaired signaling pathway may be due to low abundance miRNA which might be one of the contributing factors for the increasing severity and mortality in aged individuals and with other underlying conditions. Further, <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies are needed to validate some of these targets and identify potential therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive pathology, where dementia symptoms gradually worsen over a number of years. The hallmarks of AD, such as amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) in senile plaque and neurofibrillary tangles, are strongly intertwined with oxidative stress, which is considered one of the common effectors of the cascade of degenerative events. The endogenous nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is the \"master regulator\" of the antioxidant response and it is known as an indicator and regulator of oxidative stress. The present study aimed to determine the potential neuroprotective activity of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), a polyphenolic compound abundant in honeybee, against the neurotoxicity of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> oligomers (AβO) in mice. An intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of AβO into the mouse brain triggered increased reactive oxygen species levels, neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and memory impairment. In contrast, the intraperitoneal administration of CAPE (10 mg/kg) after i.c.v. AβO-injection counteracted oxidative stress accompanied by an induction of Nrf2 and heme oxygenase-1 via the modulation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β in the hippocampus of mice. Additionally, CAPE treatment decreased AβO-induced neuronal apoptosis and neuroinflammation, and improved learning and memory, protecting mice against the decline in spatial cognition. Our findings demonstrate that CAPE could potentially be considered as a promising neuroprotective agent against progressive neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.",

The etiopathogenesis of sporadic AD is complex and uncertain. The autopsy studies of AD brain have provided limited understanding of the antemortem pathogenesis of the disease. Experimental AD research with transgenic animal or various cell based models has so far failed to explain the complex and varied spectrum of AD dementia. The review, therefore, emphasizes the importance of AD related risk factors, especially those with metabolic implications, identified from various epidemiological studies, in providing clues to the pathogenesis of this complex disorder. Several metabolic risk factors of AD like hypercholesterolemia, hyperhomocysteinemia and type 2 diabetes have been studied extensively both in epidemiology and experimental research, while much less is known about the role of adipokines, pro-inflammatory cytokines and vitamin D in this context. Moreover, the results from many of these studies have shown a degree of variability which has hindered our understanding of the role of AD related risk factors in the disease progression. The review also encompasses the recent recommendations regarding clinical and neuropathological diagnosis of AD and brings out the inherent uncertainty and ambiguity in this area which may have a distinct impact on the outcome of various population-based studies on AD-related risk factors.",

With the advancement of wearable health devices, cloud computing, mobile technologies and Internet of Things, mobile health (mHealth) is rapidly developing and shows a promising future in the management of chronic diseases. Its advantages include its ability to improve the quality of care, reduce the costs of care, and improve treatment outcomes by transferring in-hospital treatment to patient-centered medical treatment at home. mHealth could also enhance the international cooperation of medical providers in different time zones and the sharing of high-quality medical service resources between developed and developing countries. In this review, we focus on trends in mHealth and its clinical applications for the prevention and treatment of diseases, especially aging-related neurological diseases, and on the opportunities and challenges of mHealth in China.

At the regional level, we used a flexible factorial statistical test to compare the means of gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volume alterations among the four groups. We observed different patterns in both the global and regional GM and WM alterations in the young and older groups with respect to gender. At the global level, we observed significant influences of age and gender on global brain volumes. At the regional level, the older subjects showed a widespread reduction in GM volume in regions of the frontal, insular, and cingulate cortices compared to the young subjects in both genders. Compared to the young subjects, the older subjects showed a widespread WM decline prominently in the thalamic radiations, in addition to increased WM in pericentral and occipital areas.

There is growing evidence that in addition to Aβ deposition, accumulation of hyperphosphorylated oligomeric tau contributes significantly to AD etiology. Tau oligomers are toxic and it has been suggested that they propagate in a \"prion-like\" fashion, inducing endogenous tau misfolding in cells. Their role in VCID, however, is not yet understood. The present study was designed to determine the severity of vascular deposition of oligomeric tau in the brain in patients with AD and related tauopathies, including dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Further, we examined a potential link between vascular deposition of fibrillar Aβ and that of tau oligomers in the Tg2576 mouse model. We found that tau oligomers accumulate in cerebral microvasculature of human patients with AD and PSP, in association with vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Cerebrovascular deposition of tau oligomers was also found in DLB patients. We also show that tau oligomers accumulate in cerebral microvasculature of Tg2576 mice, partially in association with cerebrovascular Aβ deposits. Thus, our findings add to the growing evidence for multifaceted microvascular involvement in the pathogenesis of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Accumulation of tau oligomers may represent a potential novel mechanism by which functional and structural integrity of the cerebral microvessels is compromised.",

    "abstract": "The complement system is an essential part of innate immunity, typically conferring protection via eliminating pathogens and accumulating debris. However, the defensive function of the complement system can exacerbate immune, inflammatory, and degenerative responses in various pathological conditions. Cumulative evidence indicates that the complement system plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of ischemic brain injury, as the depletion of certain complement components or the inhibition of complement activation could reduce ischemic brain injury. Although multiple candidates modulating or inhibiting complement activation show massive potential for the treatment of ischemic stroke, the clinical availability of complement inhibitors remains limited. The complement system is also involved in neural plasticity and neurogenesis during cerebral ischemia. Thus, unexpected side effects could be induced if the systemic complement system is inhibited. In this review, we highlighted the recent concepts and discoveries of the roles of different kinds of complement components, such as C3a, C5a, and their receptors, in both normal brain physiology and the pathophysiology of brain ischemia. In addition, we comprehensively reviewed the current development of complement-targeted therapy for ischemic stroke and discussed the challenges of bringing these therapies into the clinic. The design of future experiments was also discussed to better characterize the role of complement in both tissue injury and recovery after cerebral ischemia. More studies are needed to elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms of how complement components exert their functions in different stages of ischemic stroke to optimize the intervention of targeting the complement system.",

    "abstract": "Ischemic stroke, which is the second highest cause of death and the leading cause of disability, represents ~71% of all strokes globally. Some studies have found that the key elements of the pathobiology of stroke is immunity and inflammation. Microglia are the first line of defense in the nervous system. After stroke, the activated microglia become a double-edged sword, with distinct phenotypic changes to the deleterious M1 types and neuroprotective M2 types. Therefore, ways to promote microglial polarization toward M2 phenotype after stroke have become the focus of attention in recent years. In this review, we discuss the process of microglial polarization, summarize the alternation of signaling pathways and epigenetic regulation that control microglial polarization in ischemic stroke, aiming to find the potential mechanisms by which microglia can be transformed into the M2 polarized phenotype.",

    "abstract": "It is currently well established that the immune system is activated in response to transient or focal cerebral ischemia. This acute immune activation occurs in response to damage, and injury, to components of the neurovascular unit and is mediated by the innate and adaptive arms of the immune response. The initial immune activation is rapid, occurs via the innate immune response and leads to inflammation. The inflammatory mediators produced during the innate immune response in turn lead to recruitment of inflammatory cells and the production of more inflammatory mediators that result in activation of the adaptive immune response. Under ideal conditions, this inflammation gives way to tissue repair and attempts at regeneration. However, for reasons that are just being understood, immunosuppression occurs following acute stroke leading to post-stroke immunodepression. This review focuses on the current state of knowledge regarding innate and adaptive immune activation in response to focal cerebral ischemia as well as the immunodepression that can occur following stroke. A better understanding of the intricate and complex events that take place following immune response activation, to acute cerebral ischemia, is imperative for the development of effective novel immunomodulatory therapies for the treatment of acute stroke.",

Increasing evidence has been accumulated indicating the important role of epigenetic regulation including DNA methylation, histone modifications and miRNAs in developmental programming. Among the environmental factors which play an important role in programming of chronic pathologies, the endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that have estrogenic, anti-estrogenic, and anti-androgenic activity are of specific concern because the developing organism is extremely sensitive to perturbation by substances with hormone-like activity. Among EDCs, there are many substances that are constantly present in the modern human environment or are in widespread use, including dioxin and dioxin-like compounds, phthalates, agricultural pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, industrial solvents, pharmaceuticals, and heavy metals. Apart from their common endocrine active properties, several EDCs have been shown to disrupt developmental epigenomic programming. The purpose of this review is to provide a summary of recent research findings which indicate that exposure to EDCs during in-utero and/or neonatal development can cause long-term health outcomes via mechanisms of epigenetic memory.",

    "abstract": "Silence information regulator 1 (SIRT1), a member of the sirtuin family, targets histones and many non-histone proteins and participates in various physiological functions. The enzymatic activity of SIRT1 is decreased in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD), which may reduce their ability to resist neuronal damage caused by various neurotoxins. As far as we know, SIRT1 can induce autophagy by regulating autophagy related proteins such as AMP-activated protein kinase, light chain 3, mammalian target of rapamycin, and forkhead transcription factor 1. Furthermore, SIRT1 can regulate mitochondrial function and inhibit oxidative stress mainly by maintaining peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) in a deacetylated state and thus maintaining a constant level of PGC-1α. Other studies have demonstrated that SIRT1 may play a role in the pathophysiology of PD by regulating neuroinflammation. SIRT1 deacetylases nuclear factor-kappa B and thus reduces its transcriptional activity, inhibits inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, and decreases tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 levels. SIRT1 can also upregulate heat shock protein 70 by deacetylating heat shock factor 1 to increase the degradation of α-synuclein oligomers. Few studies have focused on the relationship between SIRT1 single nucleotide polymorphisms and PD risk, so this topic requires further research. Based on the neuroprotective effects of SIRT1 on PD, many in vitro and in vivo experiments have demonstrated that some SIRT1 activators, notably resveratrol, have potential neuroprotective effects against dopaminergic neuronal damage caused by various neurotoxins. Thus, SIRT1 plays a critical role in PD development and might be a potential target for PD therapy.",

It has been implicated as a potential therapeutic target in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease (PD). Our previous study demonstrates that SIRT3 had a neuroprotective effect on a rotenone-induced PD cell model, however, the exact mechanism is unknown. In this study, we investigated the underlying mechanism. We established a SIRT3 stable overexpression cell line using lentivirus infection in SH-SY5Y cells. Then, a PD cell model was established using rotenone. Our data demonstrate that overexpression of SIRT3 increased the level of the autophagy markers LC3 II and Beclin 1. After addition of the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA, the protective effect of SIRT3 diminished: the cell viability decreased, while the apoptosis rate increased; α-synuclein accumulation enhanced; ROS production increased; antioxidants levels, including SOD and GSH, decreased; and MMP collapsed. These results reveal that SIRT3 has neuroprotective effects on a PD cell model by up-regulating autophagy. Furthermore, SIRT3 overexpression also promoted LKB1 phosphorylation, followed by activation of AMPK and decreased phosphorylation of mTOR. These results suggest that the LKB1-AMPK-mTOR pathway has a role in induction of autophagy. Together, our findings indicate a novel mechanism by which SIRT3 protects a rotenone-induced PD cell model through the regulation of autophagy, which, in part, is mediated by activation of the LKB1-AMPK-mTOR pathway.",

In this review, we summarize currently postulated mechanisms of diabetic lung injury. We mainly focus on the pathogenesis of diabetic lung injury that implicates key pathways, including oxidative stress, non-enzymatic protein glycosylation, polyol pathway, NF-κB pathway, and protein kinase c pathway. We also highlight that while numerous studies have mainly focused on tissue or cell damage in the lung, studies focusing on mitochondrial dysfunction in the diabetic lung have remained sketchy. Hence, further understanding of mitochondrial mechanisms of diabetic lung injury should provide invaluable insights into future therapeutic approaches for diabetic lung injury.",

As numerous patients with cancer are long-term survivors, CICI represent a significant factor which may interfere with their quality of life. However, this entity CICI must be distinguished from other cognitive syndromes and addressed accordingly. At the present time, experimental and clinical research suggests that CICI could be induced by numerous factors including <i>oxidative stress</i>. This type of CNS injury has been previously described in cancer patients treated with common anti-neoplastic drugs such as doxorubicine, carmustine, methotrexate and cyclophosphamide. It seems that all these pharmacological factors promote neuronal death through a final common pathway represented by TNF alpha (tumour necrosis factor). However, as cancer in general is diagnosed more commonly in the aging population, the elderly oncological patient must be treated with great care since aging <i>per se</i> is also impacted by oxidative stress and potentiually by TNF alpha deleterious action on brain parenchyma. In this context, some patients may develop cognitive dysfunction well before the appearance of CICI. In addition, chemotherapy may worsen their cognitive function. Therefore, at the present time, there is an acute need for development of effective therapeutic methods to prevent CICI as well as new methods of early CICI diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes is a systemic disease that can cause brain damage such as synaptic impairments in the hippocampus, which is partly because of neuroinflammation induced by hyperglycemia. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is essential in modulating neuroplasticity. Its role in anti-inflammation in diabetes is largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated the effects of BDNF overexpression on reducing neuroinflammation and the underlying mechanism in mice with type 1 diabetes induced by streptozotocin (STZ). Animals were stereotactically microinjected in the hippocampus with recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing BDNF or EGFP. After virus infection, four groups of mice, the EGFP+STZ, BDNF+STZ, EGFP Control and BDNF Control groups, received STZ or vehicle treatment as indicated. Three weeks later brain tissues were collected. We found that BDNF overexpression in the hippocampus significantly rescued STZ-induced decreases in mRNA and protein expression of two synaptic plasticity markers, spinophilin and synaptophysin. More interestingly, BDNF inhibited hyperglycemia-induced microglial activation and reduced elevated levels of inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-6). BDNF blocked the increase in HMGB1 levels and specifically, in levels of one of the HMGB1 receptors, RAGE. Downstream of HMGB1/RAGE, the increase in the protein level of phosphorylated NF-κB was also reversed by BDNF in STZ-treated mice. These results show that BDNF overexpression reduces neuroinflammation in the hippocampus of type 1 diabetic mice and suggest that the HMGB1/RAGE/NF-κB signaling pathway may contribute to alleviation of neuroinflammation by BDNF in diabetic mice.",

It is anticipated that, with continuously increasing life expectancy, these diseases will pose a serious social and health problem in the near feature. Meanwhile, however, their etiology remains largely obscure even though all possible novel clues are being thoroughly examined. In this regard, a concept has been proposed that p53, as a transcription factor controlling many vital cellular pathways including apoptosis, may contribute to neuronal death common to all neurodegenerative disorders. In this work, we review the research devoted to the possible role of p53 in the pathogenesis of these diseases. We not only describe aberrant changes in p53 level/activity observed in CNS regions affected by particular diseases but, most importantly, put special attention to the complicated reciprocal regulatory ties existing between p53 and proteins commonly regarded as pathological hallmarks of these diseases, with the ultimate goal to identify the primary element of their pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Although the geroprotectors discovery is a new biomedicine trend and more than 200 compounds can slow aging and increase the lifespan of the model organism, there are still no geroprotectors on the market. The reasons may be partly related to the lack of a unified concept of geroprotector, accepted by the scientific community. Such concept as a system of criteria for geroprotector identification and classification can form a basis for an analytical model of anti-aging drugs, help to consolidate the efforts of various research initiatives in this area and compare their results. Here, we review the existing classification and characteristics of geroprotectors based on their effect on the survival of a group of individuals or pharmaceutics classes, according to the proposed mechanism of their geroprotective action or theories of aging. After discussing advantages and disadvantages of these approaches, we offer a new concept based on the maintenance of homeostatic capacity because aging can be considered as exponential shrinkage of homeostatic capacity leading to the onset of age-related diseases and death. Besides, we review the most promising current screening approaches to finding new geroprotectors. Establishing the classification of existing geroprotectors based on physiology and current understanding of the nature of aging is essential for putting the existing knowledge into a single system. This system could be useful to formulate standards for finding and creating new geroprotectors. Standardization, in turn, would allow easier comparison and combination of experimental data obtained by different research groups.",

    "abstract": "Age is one of the most important prognostic factors associated to lethality in SARS-CoV-2 infection. In multivariate analysis, advanced age was an independent risk factor for death. Recent studies suggest a role for the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine rich repeat containing family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation in lung inflammation and fibrosis in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Increased NLRP3/ apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) mRNA expression and increased caspase-1 activity, have been observed in aged lung, provoking increased and heightened expression levels of mature Interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 in aged individuals. Aged individuals have a basal predisposition to over-react to infection, displaying an increased hyper-inflammatory cascade, that seems not to be fully physiologically controlled. NLRP3 inflammasome is over-activated in aged individuals, through deficient mitochondrial functioning, increased mitochondrial Reactive Oxigen Species (mtROS) and/or mitochondrial (mt)DNA, leading to a hyper-response of classically activated macrophages and subsequent increases in IL-1 β. This NLRP3 over-activated status in elderly individuals, is also observed in telomere dysfunctional mice models. In our opinion, the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a central role in the increased lethality observed in elderly patients infected by COVID-19. Strategies blocking inflammasome would deserve to be studied.",

Injury to the brain is ongoing after TBI, through a complex cascade of primary and secondary injury events, providing a valuable window of opportunity to help limit and prevent some of the severe consequences with a timely treatment. Of note, it has been suggested that novel treatments for TBI should be multifactorial in nature, mimicking the body's own endogenous repair response. Whilst research has historically focused on the role of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, recent advances in trauma research have demonstrated that APP offers considerable neuroprotective properties following TBI, suggesting that APP is an ideal therapeutic candidate. Its acute upregulation following TBI has been shown to serve a beneficial role following trauma and has lead to significant advances in understanding the neuroprotective and neurotrophic functions of APP and its metabolites. Research has focused predominantly on the APP derivative sAPPα, which has consistently demonstrated neuroprotective and neurotrophic functions both in vitro and in vivo following various traumatic insults. Its neuroprotective activity has been narrowed down to a 15 amino acid sequence, and this region is linked to both heparan binding and growth-factor-like properties. It has been proposed that APP binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans to exert its neuroprotective action. APP presents us with a novel therapeutic compound that could overcome many of the challenges that have stalled development of efficacious TBI treatments previously.",

The aim of this study is to compare the impact of varying degrees of HV on foot health in a sample of older people. The sample consisted of 115 participants, mean age 76.7 ± 9.1, who attended an outpatient center where self-report data were recorded. The degree of HV deformity was determined in both feet using the Manchester Scale (MS) from stage 1 (mild) to 4 (very severe). Scores obtained on the Foot Health Status Questionnaire (FHSQ) were compared. This has 13 questions that assess 4 health domains of the feet, namely pain, function, general health and footwear. The stage 4 of HV shown lower scores for the footwear domain (11.23 ± 15.6); general foot health (27.62 ± 19.1); foot pain (44.65 ± 24.5); foot function (53.04 ± 27.2); vigour (42.19 ± 16.8); social capacity (44.46 ± 28.1); and general health (41.15 ± 25.5) compared with stage 1 of HV (P<0.05) and there were no differences of physical activity (62.81 ± 24.6). Often, quality of life decreases in the elderly population based in large part on their foot health. There is a progressive reduction in health in general and foot health with increasing severity of hallux valgus deformity which appears to be associated with the presence of greater degree of HV, regardless of gender.",

Moreover, evidence-based clinical therapeutic strategies and pitfalls of specific sleep disorders after stroke are discussed. We also review the neurobiological mechanisms of these treatments as well as their effects on stroke.

The plasticity between the two lineages has been confirmed over the past decades, and has important implications in the etiology of bone diseases such as osteoporosis, which involves an imbalance between osteoblasts and adipocytes. The commitment and differentiation of bone marrow (BM) MSCs is tightly controlled by the local environment that maintains a balance between osteoblast lineage and adipocyte. However, pathological conditions linked to osteoporosis can change the BM microenvironment and shift the MSC fate to favor adipocytes over osteoblasts, and consequently decrease bone mass with marrow fat accumulation. This review discusses the changes that occur in the BM microenvironment under pathological conditions, and how these changes affect MSC fate. We suggest that manipulating local environments could have therapeutic implications to avoid bone loss in diseases like osteoporosis.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrion is susceptible to neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Mitochondrial dysfunction has been considered to play an important role in the dopaminergic degeneration in PD. However, there are no effective drugs to protect mitochondria from dysfunction during the disease development. In the present study, fucoidan, a sulfated polysaccharide derived from Laminaria japonica, was investigated and characterized for its protective effect on the dopamine system and mitochondrial function of dopaminergic neurons in a rotenone-induced rat model of PD. We found that chronic treatment with fucoidan significantly reversed the loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons and striatal dopaminergic fibers and the reduction of striatal dopamine levels in PD rats. Fucoidan also alleviated rotenone-induced behavioral deficits. Moreover, the mitochondrial respiratory function as detected by the mitochondrial oxygen consumption and the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) and nuclear transcription factor 2 (NRF2) were reduced in the substantia nigra of PD rats, which were markedly reversed by fucoidan. Oxidative products induced by rotenone were significantly reduced by fucoidan. Taken together, these results demonstrate that fucoidan possesses the ability to protect the dopamine system in PD rats. The neuroprotective effect of fucoidan may be mediated via reserving mitochondrial function involving the PGC-1α/NRF2 pathway. This study provides new evidence that fucoidan can be explored in PD therapy.",

Low emission of transcranial near-infrared (tNIR) light can reach human brain parenchyma and be beneficial to a number of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. We hereby examined the safety and potential therapeutic benefits of tNIR light stimulations in the treatment of dementia. Patients of mild to moderate dementia were randomized into active and sham treatment groups at 2:1 ratio. Active treatment consisted of low power tNIR light stimulations with an active photobiomodulation for 6 min twice daily during 8 consequent weeks. Sham treatment consisted of same treatment routine with a sham device. Neuropsychological battery was obtained before and after treatment. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze outcomes. Sixty subjects were enrolled. Fifty-seven subjects completed the study and had not reported health or adverse side effects during or after the treatment. Three subjects dropped out from trial for health issues unrelated to use of tNIR light treatment. Treatment with active device resulted in improvements of cognitive functions and changes were: an average increase of MMSE by 4.8 points; Logical Memory Tests I and II by ~3.0 points; Trail Making Tests A and B by ~24%; Boston Naming Test by ~9%; improvement of both Auditory Verbal Learning Tests in all subtest categories and overall time of performance. Many patients reported improved sleep after ~7 days of treatment. Caregivers noted that patients had less anxiety, improved mood, energy, and positive daily routine after ~14-21 days of treatment. The tNIR light treatments demonstrated safety and positive cognitive improvements in patients with dementia. Developed treatment protocol can be conveniently used at home. This study suggests that additional dementia treatment trials are warranted with a focus on mitigating caregivers' burden with tNIR light treatment of dementia patients.",

The high prevalence and disability rates of stroke and depression introduce enormous challenges to public health. Accumulating evidence reveals that stroke is tightly associated with depression, and both diseases are linked to oxidative stress (OS). This review summarizes the mechanisms of OS and OS-mediated pathological processes, such as inflammation, apoptosis, and the microbial-gut-brain axis in stroke and depression. Pathological changes can lead to neuronal cell death, neurological deficits, and brain injury through DNA damage and the oxidation of lipids and proteins, which exacerbate the development of these two disorders. Additionally, aging accelerates the progression of stroke and depression by overactive OS and reduced antioxidant defenses. This review also discusses the efficacy and safety of several antioxidants and antidepressants in stroke and depression. Herein, we propose a crosstalk between OS, aging, stroke, and depression, and provide potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of stroke and depression.",

    "abstract": "Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Whether hemorrhagic or ischemic, stroke leads to severe long-term disability. Prior to the mid-1990s, the treatment offered to a patient who presented with an acute stroke was mainly limited to antiplatelets. The lack of adequate treatment, in particular, one without reperfusion contributed to the disability that ensued. There have been many advances in stroke care within the past two decades, especially with the acute management of ischemic stroke. Even with these advances, it is quite alarming that only a fraction of patients receives acute stroke treatment. Numerous trials were conducted to broaden treatment eligibility in hopes that more patients can be treated acutely and safely. These trials have tested both the time window for IV tPA and endovascular therapy (EVT). Acute stroke management is moving from a universal time window approach to a concept of tissue preservation. Specifically, preserving cerebral blood flow, the penumbra, and reducing the risk of a second event. This movement is being executed through the use of multimodal CT and MRI, as well as individualizing treatment to our patients. Minimizing the initial effect of stroke changes the outcome and leads to an increased likelihood of functional independence. In this review, we discuss the recent updates of acute ischemic stroke management in regards to mechanical thrombectomy as well as thrombolytics including tenecteplase.",

    "abstract": "The most common form of dementia is Alzheimer's disease which is characterized by memory loss and cognitive disorders. The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease is not known at present but toxicity of amyloid-beta is one of the central hypotheses. Amyloid-beta can stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), cause oxidative stress, damage mitochondrial, cause inflammatory reactions and activate apoptosis related factors which lead to the neuronal death. In this study, we found that artemisinin, a first line antimalarial drug used in clinic for decades, improved the cognitive functions in Alzheimer's disease animal model 3xTg mice. Further study showed that artemisinin reduced the deposition of amyloid-beta and tau protein, reduced the release of inflammation factors and apoptosis factors, and thereby reduced the neuronal cell death. Western blot assay showed that artemisinin stimulated the activation of ERK/CREB signaling pathway. Consistent with these results, artemisinin concentration-dependently promoted the survival of SH-SY5Y cell against toxicity of amyloid-beta protein 1-42 induced ROS accumulation, caspase activation and apoptosis. Artemisinin also stimulated the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and CREB in SH-SY5Y cells in time and concentration-dependent manner. Inhibition of ERK/CREB pathway attenuated the protective effect of artemisinin. These data put together suggested that artemisinin has the potential to protect neuronal cells <i>in vitro</i> as well as <i>in vivo</i> animal model 3xTg mice via, at least in part, the activation of the ERK/CREB pathway. Our findings also strongly support the potential of artemisinin as a new multi-target drug that can be used for preventing and treating the Alzheimer's disease.",

Spermidine, a natural polyamine, plays a critical role in molecular and cellular interactions involved in various physiological and functional processes. Spermidine has been shown to modulate aging, suppress the occurrence and severity of age-related diseases, and prolong lifespan. However, the precise mechanisms through which spermidine exerts its anti-aging effects have not been established. In this review, we elucidate on the mechanisms and roles underlying the beneficial effects of spermidine in aging from a molecular and cellular perspective. Moreover, we provide new insights into the promising potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications of spermidine in aging and age-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Dyslipidemia, characterized by a high level of lipids (cholesterol, triglycerides, or both), can increase the risk of developing and progressing atherosclerosis. As atherosclerosis progresses, the number and severity of aterial plagues increases with greater risk of myocardial infarction, a major contributor to cardiovascular mortality. Atherosclerosis progresses in four phases, namely endothelial dysfunction, fatty streak formation, lesion progression and plaque rupture, and eventually thrombosis and arterial obstruction. With greater understanding of the pathological processes underlying atherosclerosis, researchers have identified that lipoproteins play a significant role in the development of atherosclerosis. In particular, apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing lipoproteins have been shown to associate with atherosclerosis. Oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ox-LDLs) also contribute to the progression of atherosclerosis whereas high-density lipoproteins (HDL) contribute to the removal of cholesterol from macrophages thereby inhibiting the formation of foam cells. Given these known associations, lipoproteins may have potential as biomarkers for predicting risk associated with atherosclerotic plaques or may be targets as novel therapeutic agents. As such, the rapid development of drugs targeting lipoprotein metabolism may lead to novel treatments for atherosclerosis. A comprehensive review of lipoprotein function and their role in atherosclerosis, along with the latest development of lipoprotein targeted treatment, is timely. This review focuses on the functions of different lipoproteins and their involvement in atherosclerosis. Further, diagnostic and therapeutic potential are highlighted giving insight into novel lipoprotein-targetted approaches to treat atherosclerosis.",

Altered TRP metabolism has been implicated in the pathophysiology of various diseases of the central nervous system. TRP is metabolized through two main pathways, the kynurenine pathway and the methoxyindole pathway. First, TRP is metabolized to kynurenine, then kynurenic acid, quinolinic acid, anthranilic acid, 3-hydroxykynurenine, and finally 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid along the kynurenine pathway. Second, TRP is metabolized to serotonin and melatonin along the methoxyindole pathway. In this review, we summarize the biological properties of key metabolites and their pathogenic functions in 12 disorders of the central nervous system: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease. Furthermore, we summarize preclinical and clinical studies, mainly since 2015, that investigated the metabolic pathway of TRP, focusing on changes in biomarkers of these neurologic disorders, their pathogenic implications, and potential therapeutic strategies targeting this metabolic pathway. This critical, comprehensive, and up-to-date review helps identify promising directions for future preclinical, clinical, and translational research on neuropsychiatric disorders.",

The etiology, pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of VaD are extremely heterogeneous, but the impaired cerebral blood flow (CBF) represents a common denominator of VaD. The latter might be the result of atherosclerosis, amyloid angiopathy, microbleeding and micro-strokes, together causing blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction and vessel leakage, collectively originating from the consequence of hypertension, one of the main risk factors for VaD. At the histopathological level, VaD displays abnormal vascular remodeling, endothelial cell death, string vessel formation, pericyte responses, fibrosis, astrogliosis, sclerosis, microglia activation, neuroinflammation, demyelination, white matter lesions, deprivation of synapses and neuronal loss. The transforming growth factor (TGF) β has been identified as one of the key molecular factors involved in the aforementioned various pathological aspects. Thus, targeting TGF-β signaling in the brain might be a promising therapeutic strategy to mitigate vascular pathology and improve cognitive functions in patients with VaD. This review revisits the recent understanding of the role of TGF-β in VaD and associated pathological hallmarks. It further explores the potential to modulate certain aspects of VaD pathology by targeting TGF-β signaling.",

Several indexes have been used to quantify frailty. Spine diseases, both degenerative and oncologic, frequently require surgery which is related to complications and mortality. Aim of the present systematic review was to collect the most frequently used frailty indexes in clinics to predict surgical outcomes in patients affected by spine diseases, taking into account gender differences. Three databases were employed, and 29 retrospective clinical studies were included in this systematic review. The identified spine pathologies were primary and metastatic spine tumors, adult spine deformity (ASD), degenerative spine disease (DSD), cervical deformity (CD) and other pathologies that affected lumbar spine or multiple spine levels. Eleven indexes were identified: modified Frailty Index (mFI), Adult spinal deformity frailty index (ASD-FI), mFI-5, Metastatic Spinal Tumor Frailty Index (MSTFI), Fried criteria, Cervical deformity frailty index (CD-FI), Spinal tumor frailty index (STFI), Frailty Phenotype criteria (FP), Frailty Index (FI), FRAIL scale and Modified CD-FI (mCD-FI). All these indexes correlated well with minor and major postoperative complications, mortality and length of stay in hospital. Results on gender differences and frailty are still conflicting, although few studies show that women are more likely to develop frailty and more complications in the post-operative period than men. This systematic review could help the surgeon in the adoption of frailty indexes, before the operation, and in preventing complications in frail patients.",

It has been reported that exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can contribute to the recovery of PD. However, the underlying mechanism remains poorly defined. In this study, proteomics and time-series analysis showed that exosomes derived from MSCs can keep human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) in a transcriptionally active state, which may be beneficial for angiogenesis. Next, we found that MSC-derived exosomes can promote the angiogenesis of HBMECs by increasing the expression of ICAM1, and alleviate the damage caused by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) in these cells. Accordingly, when ICAM1 was knocked down, the tube formation ability of HBMECs was obviously decreased. In addition, ICAM1 was found to promote the angiogenesis of HBMECs by activating the SMAD3 and P38MAPK signaling pathways. In a PD mouse model, MSC-derived exosomes were found to contribute to the recovery of PD by promoting ICAM1-related angiogenesis. These findings demonstrate that the exosome-ICAM1-SMAD3/P38MAPK axis can promote the angiogenesis of HBMECs, with possible therapeutic potential for PD.",

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate evidence for changes in the diet and physical activity habits of older adults due to COVID-19-related lockdowns. We included analytic observational studies that reported on changes in diet, physical activity, or both, among older individuals (≥50 years old). We searched PubMed and EBSCO LISTA to identify original research articles published between 01/2020-03/2021. We identified 27 studies, 5 of which reported on changes in diet, 17 on changes in physical activity, and 5 on changes in both. The sample sizes ranged from 17 to 3110 subjects. Six of 10 papers on diet reported no significant changes in quantity or quality of food consumption; of those who did find changes in diet, these were generally unfavorable. Thirteen of 22 studies on physical activity reported a decrease in physical activity or an increase in sedentary time; the rest reported no major changes. Pre-lockdown habits were a predictor of change in some studies. The safer-at-home measures have not greatly impacted the diet of older adults but have led to a significant decrease in their physical activity, putting them at higher risk for non-communicable diseases, which may further increase their susceptibility to COVID-19. Ultimately, these findings may help guide clinical practice, by promoting additional health screenings by general practitioners for the elderly and by emphasizing the need for lifestyle interventions like at-home exercise initiatives, to help mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on this especially vulnerable age group.",

In this review, I describe the similarities between depression and dementia and how to differentiate depression in dementia treatment based on the differences and emphasize that there is a significant potential to cure depression, in contrast to dementia, for which there is currently no fundamental therapy. Therefore, it is important to recognize that depression and dementia may present with common symptoms and to appropriately differentiate depressed patients who are suspected of having dementia. Dementia is a disorder in which cognitive dysfunction is caused by a variety of causative diseases and conditions, resulting in impairment of activities of daily living. However, current medical science has had difficulty finding a cure for the causative disease. Based on clinical findings, it has also been shown that the degree of symptoms for preexisting psychiatric disorders is alleviated as the brain ages. In the presence of dementia, the speed of the alleviation will increase. The importance of focusing on the positive aspects of aging is also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains a severe disease for most patients, with its incidence and prevalence increasingly globally.Currently, there is no effective treatments for IBD, and traditional treatments have multiple side effects.Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies or alternative drugs are urgently needed.Previous studies have shown that mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes have exhibited promising therapeutic effects on inflammatory disease.Here, we performed intravenous injection of human adipose mesenchymal stem cell (hADSC)-derived exosomes (hADSC-Exo) in a DSS-induced IBD mouse model and found that hADSC-Exo promoted functional recovery, downregulated inflammatory responses, reduced intestine cell apoptosis, increased epithelial regeneration and maintained intestinal barrier integrity.Moreover, we established a colon organoid, hADSC-Exo and TNF-α co-cultured system to explore the protective effect of hADSC-Exo on integrity of intestine mucosa and epithelial regeneration.We showed that hADSC-Exo not only can promote the proliferation and regeneration of Lgr5 + ISCs and epithelial cells but also ameliorate the inflammation damage in TNF-α induced inflammatory damaged mice colon organoids.Taken together, our findings indicate that hADSC-Exo protects intestine integrity, activates intestine epithelial cell and ISCs proliferation, suggesting that hADSC-Exo might be a potential effective treatment approach for IBD.We also provide a theoretical basis for new therapeutic strategies for cell-free therapy in inflammatory bowel disease.

A growing body of evidence has manifested that curcumin has extensive pharmacological activities including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxygenation, lipid regulation, antiviral, and anticancer with hypotoxicity and minor adverse reactions. However, the disadvantages of low bioavailability, short half-life in plasma, low drug concentration in blood, and poor oral absorption severely limited the clinical application of curcumin. Pharmaceutical researchers have carried out plenty of dosage form transformations to improve the druggability of curcumin and have achieved remarkable results. Therefore, the objective of this review summarizes the pharmacological research progress, problems in clinical application and the improvement methods of curcumin's druggability. By reviewing the latest research progress of curcumin, we believe that curcumin has a broad clinical application prospect for its wide range of pharmacological activities with few side effects. The deficiencies of lower bioavailability of curcumin could be improved by dosage form transformation. However, curcumin in the clinical application still requires further study regarding the underlying mechanism and clinical trial verification.",

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a serious threat to the health of older adults. Despite the significant progress in immunotherapy, effective treatments for NSCLC remain limited. The development of tumors indicates failure in immune surveillance and the successful immune escape of tumor cells. Research on the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) revealed these opposing immune processes and contributed to the discovery of new methods to suppress the immune escape and restore the immune surveillance functions. This paper aimed to provide updates on the current findings regarding the relevance of TIME in NSCLC treatment. It also aimed to introduce the TIME, immune editing, cancer immunotherapy, and new challenges. Based on the clinical data, the combination of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy is suitable for patients with NSCLC who are not eligible to undergo surgery. Combined ICI therapy after epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy should be considered in patients with EGFR mutations. Chemoradiotherapy may increase the density of CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes, which is significantly associated with better prognosis. For older patients and those with advanced-stage disease, regional tumor treatments, such as stereotactic radiation therapy and percutaneous cryoablation, may be more suitable, but further studies are needed to confirm this. In conclusion, restoring immune surveillance is as important as removing cancerous tissues; further studies that include the use of combined treatment methods, individualized treatment plans, and immunonutrition are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Blood brain barrier (BBB) injury is an important factor affecting the prognosis of ischemic stroke. Extensive research on BBB injury has revealed that blood vessels and neural networks are interdependent and interrelated during and after the development of the brain. An array of signaling molecules, known as angioneurins, can affect both blood vessels and neural networks simultaneously. Angioneurins not only regulate the angiogenesis and remodeling process of the vascular system, but also act as neurotrophic and neuroprotective factors, or serve as guide molecules for axons. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a type of angioneurin that is expressed in neurons, astrocytes, macrophages, and vascular endothelial cells in ischemic and hypoxic brain tissues after cerebral ischemia. VEGF can increase and induce the destruction of the endothelial barrier in the early stages of cerebral ischemia. Both the upregulation of endogenous VEGF levels and the use of exogenous VEGF are harmful in the acute stage of stroke. However, the harmful effects of VEGF on vascular integrity are transient. Several studies have shown that VEGF regulates angiogenesis, neurogenesis, neurite growth and brain edema after cerebral ischemia. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the dual role of VEGF in ischemic stroke. The following will focus on the damage caused by VEGF to the BBB in the context of cerebral ischemic stroke, as well as therapeutic studies targeting VEGF.",

However, studies have shown that, even with the timely opening of occluded blood vessels, nearly half of all patients treated with endovascular therapy for acute ischemic stroke still have poor functional recovery, a phenomenon called “futile recanalization.”. The pathophysiology of futile recanalization is complex and may include tissue no-reflow (microcirculation reperfusion failure despite recanalization of the occluded large artery), early arterial reocclusion (reocclusion of the recanalized artery 24-48 hours post endovascular therapy), poor collateral circulation, hemorrhagic transformation (cerebral bleeding following primary ischemic stroke), impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation, and large hypoperfusion volume. Therapeutic strategies targeting these mechanisms have been attempted in preclinical research; however, translation to the bedside remains to be explored. This review summarizes the risk factors, pathophysiological mechanisms, and targeted therapy strategies of futile recanalization, focusing on the mechanisms and targeted therapy strategies of no-reflow to deepen the understanding of this phenomenon and provide new translational research ideas and potential intervention targets for improving the efficacy of endovascular therapy for acute ischemic stroke.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer’s disease, one of the most common forms of dementia, is characterized by a slow progression of cognitive impairment and neuronal loss. Currently, approved treatments for AD are hindered by various side effects and limited efficacy. Despite considerable research, practical treatments for AD have not been developed. Increasing evidence shows that glial cells, especially microglia and astrocytes, are essential in the initiation and progression of AD. During AD progression, activated resident microglia increases the ability of resting astrocytes to transform into reactive astrocytes, promoting neurodegeneration. Extensive clinical and molecular studies show the involvement of microglia and astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation in AD pathology, indicating that microglia and astrocytes may be potential therapeutic targets for AD. This review will summarize the significant and recent advances of microglia and astrocytes in the pathogenesis of AD in three parts. First, we will review the typical pathological changes of AD and discuss microglia and astrocytes in terms of function and phenotypic changes. Second, we will describe microglia and astrocytes’ physiological and pathological role in AD. These roles include the inflammatory response, “eat me” and “don’t eat me” signals, Aβ seeding, propagation, clearance, synapse loss, synaptic pruning, remyelination, and demyelination. Last, we will review the pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies targeting microglia and astrocytes in AD. We conclude that microglia and astrocytes are essential in the initiation and development of AD. Therefore, understanding the new role of microglia and astrocytes in AD progression is critical for future AD studies and clinical trials. Moreover, pharmacological, and non-pharmacological therapies targeting microglia and astrocytes, with specific studies investigating microglia and astrocyte-mediated neuronal damage and repair, may be a promising research direction for future studies regarding AD treatment and prevention.",

    "abstract": "The field of Alzheimer's disease (AD) research critically lacks an all-inclusive etiology theory that would integrate existing hypotheses and explain the heterogeneity of disease trajectory and pathologies observed in each individual patient. Here, we propose a novel comprehensive theory that we named: the multipathology convergence to chronic neuronal stress. Our new theory reconsiders long-standing dogmas advanced by previous incomplete theories. Firstly, while it is undeniable that amyloid beta (Aβ) is involved in AD, in the seminal stage of the disease Aβ is unlikely pathogenic. Instead, we hypothesize that the root cause of AD is neuronal stress in the central nervous system (CNS), and Aβ is expressed as part of the physiological response to protect CNS neurons from stress. If there is no return to homeostasis, then Aβ becomes overexpressed, and this includes the generation of longer forms that are more toxic and prone to oligomerization. Secondly, AD etiology is plausibly not strictly compartmentalized within the CNS but may also result from the dysfunction of other physiological systems in the entire body. This view implies that AD may not have a single cause, but rather needs to be considered as a spectrum of multiple chronic pathological modalities converging to the persistent stressing of CNS neurons. These chronic pathological modalities, which include cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders, and CNS structural changes, often start individually, and over time combine with other chronic modalities to incrementally escalate the amount of stress applied to CNS neurons. We present the case for considering Aβ as a marker of neuronal stress in response to hypoxic, toxic, and starvation events, rather than solely a marker of AD. We also detail numerous human chronic conditions that can lead to neuronal stress in the CNS, making the link with co-morbidities encountered in daily clinical AD practice. Finally, we explain how our theory could be leveraged to improve clinical care for AD and related dementia in personalized medicine paradigms in the near future.",

    "abstract": "Nucleus pulposus (NP) cell (NPC) senescence is one of the main causes of intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD). However, the underlying mechanism of NPC senescence is still unclear. The cannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2R) is a member of the cannabinoid system and plays an important role in antioxidative stress, anti-inflammatory and antisenescence activities. In this study, we used a hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-induced NPC senescence model and a rat acupuncture IVDD model to explore the role of CB2R in IVDD in vitro and in vivo. First, we confirmed that the expression of p16INK4a in the NP tissues of IVDD patients and rat acupuncture IVDD models obviously increased accompanied by a decrease in CB2R expression. Subsequently, we found that activation of CB2R significantly reduced the number of SA-β-gal positive cells and suppressed the expression of p16INK4a and senescence-related secretory phenotypes [SASP, including matrix metalloproteinase 9 and 13 (MMP9, MMP13) and high mobility group protein b1 (HMGB1)]. In addition, activation of CB2R promoted the expression of collagen type II (Col-2) and SRY-Box transcription factor 9 (SOX9), inhibit the expression of collagen type X (Col-X), and restore the balance of extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism. In addition, the AMPK/GSK3β pathway was shown to play an important role in CB2R regulation of NPC senescence. Inhibition of AMPK expression reversed the effect of JWH015 (a CB2R agonist). Finally, we further demonstrated that in the rat IVDD model, the AMPK/GSK3β pathway was involved in the regulation of CB2R on NPC senescence. In conclusion, our experimental results prove that CB2R plays an important role in NPC senescence. Activation of CB2R can delay NPC senescence, restore the balance of ECM metabolism, and attenuate IVDD.",

In this study, we explored the influence and potential mechanisms of P-gp on BBB function in experimental ischemic stroke in vivo and in vitro. Middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) was created in mice. Oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) was performed in brain microvascular vessel-derived endothelial cells (bEnd.3) to mimic ischemia/reperfusion injury in vitro. P-gp-specific siRNA and pharmacological inhibitor cyclosporine A were used to inhibit P-gp, whereas pcDNA3.1 was utilized to overexpress P-gp. Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, acute ischemic stroke outcome, BBB integrity and permeability, autophagic proteins and relative signaling pathways were evaluated. P-gp levels were markedly elevated in mouse brain and endothelial cells following MCAO/R and OGD/R, respectively. P-gp siRNA silencing or pharmacologically inhibiting (cyclosporine A) reduced infarct volume and brain edema, attenuated brain pathology, and improved neurological behavior in association with attenuated accumulation of neutrophils and macrophages, reduced expression levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1). P-gp silence also counteracted BBB leakage, restored the expressions of tight junction proteins (Claudin-5, Occludin and ZO-1), activated autophagic proteins (upregulated LC3-II/LC3-I and Beclin 1, and downregulated P62), and diminished Akt/mTOR signal activity in mice following MCAO/R. In the endothelial cell OGD/R assay, P-gp silence downregulated the expressions of inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules, inhibited leukocytes adhesion and migration, increased tight junction protein levels, and activated autophagy, all were reversible by forceful P-gp expression. Additionally, treatment with an autophagy inhibitor (3-methyladenine) abolished protections against ischemic stroke and tight junction proteins reduction followed by P-gp silence. In conclusion, increased P-gp expression after ischemic injury resulted in BBB dysfunction and hyperpermeability by suppressing Akt/mTOR-induced endothelial autophagy.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial dysfunction develops gradually with age, and is the foundation of many age-related diseases in the elderly. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway in aging-related endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial functional parameters and biochemical indices of vascular function were examined in 2-, 6-, 12- and 24-month-old mice. Then, 6-month-old mice were administered RU.521, a specific inhibitor of cGAS, for 6 months, and endothelial functional parameters and biochemical indices of vascular function were re-examined. An <i>in vitro</i> model of cell senescence was established by treating human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) with D-Galactose (D-GAL). Using inhibitors or siRNA interference, cGAS and STING were suppressed or silenced in senescent HAECs, and changes in the expression of eNOS, the senescence markers, p53, p21 and p16, components of the cGAS-STING pathway and Senescence-Associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining were examined. Finally, cGAS, STING and p-IRF3 levels were measured in aorta tissue sections from eight patients. A decline in endothelial function, up-regulation of p53, p21 and p16 expression, and activation of the cGAS-STING pathway were observed in aging mice. Inhibition of cGAS was found to improve endothelial function and reverse the increased expression of aging markers. Our <i>in vitro</i> data demonstrated that D-GAL induced a decrease in eNOS expression and cell senescence, which could be partly reversed by cGAS inhibitor, STING inhibitor, siRNA-cGAS and siRNA-STING treatment. Higher expression levels of cGAS, STING and p-IRF3 were observed in aged human aortic intima tissue compared to young aortic intima tissue. Our study demonstrated that activation of the cGAS-STING pathway played a vital role in aging-related endothelial dysfunction. Thus, the cGAS-STING pathway may be a potential target for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases in the elderly.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disease of the central nervous system. The pathogenesis of AD has been explained using cholinergic, β-amyloid toxicity, tau protein hyperphosphorylation, and oxidative stress theories. However, an effective treatment method has not been developed. In recent years, with the discovery of the brain-gut axis (BGA) and breakthroughs made in Parkinson's disease, depression, autism, and other diseases, BGA has become a hotspot in AD research. Several studies have shown that gut microbiota can affect the brain and behavior of patients with AD, especially their cognitive function. Animal models, fecal microbiota transplantation, and probiotic intervention also provide evidence regarding the correlation between gut microbiota and AD. This article discusses the relationship and related mechanisms between gut microbiota and AD based on BGA to provide possible strategies for preventing or alleviating AD symptoms by regulating gut microbiota.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is common and increasing in prevalence worldwide, with devastating public health consequences. While peripheral insulin resistance is a key feature of most forms of T2DM and has been investigated for over a century, research on brain insulin resistance (BIR) has more recently been developed, including in the context of T2DM and non-diabetes states. Recent data support the presence of BIR in the aging brain, even in non-diabetes states, and found that BIR may be a feature in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and contributes to cognitive impairment. Further, therapies used to treat T2DM are now being investigated in the context of AD treatment and prevention, including insulin. In this review, we offer a definition of BIR, and present evidence for BIR in AD; we discuss the expression, function, and activation of the insulin receptor (INSR) in the brain; how BIR could develop; tools to study BIR; how BIR correlates with current AD hallmarks; and regional/cellular involvement of BIR. We close with a discussion on resilience to both BIR and AD, how current tools can be improved to better understand BIR, and future avenues for research. Overall, this review and position paper highlights BIR as a plausible therapeutic target for the prevention of cognitive decline and dementia due to AD.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still an ongoing pandemic worldwide. COVID-19 is an age-related disease with a higher risk of organ dysfunction and mortality in older adults. Coagulation disorders and thrombosis are important pathophysiological changes in COVID-19 infection. Up to 95% of COVID-19 patients have coagulation disorders characterized by an elevated D-dimer, a prolonged prothrombin time, a low platelet count and other laboratory abnormalities. Thrombosis is found in critical cases with an increased risk of death. Endothelial cells are prone to be affected by the novel SARS-CoV-2 and express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. The evidence, such as the presence of the virus, has been identified, leading to the inflammation and dysfunction. Endothelial cell activation and dysfunction play a pivotal role in the hypercoagulation status in COVID-19 patients. In addition to the direct exposure of subendothelial tissue to blood, Weibel-Palade bodies within the endothelium containing coagulants can be released into the circulation. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase may be impaired, thus facilitating platelet adhesion. Moreover, anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibodies may also contribute to the coagulopathy in COVID-19 by inducing the upregulation of proinflammatory mediators and adhesion molecules. To conclude, coagulation disorders and thrombosis are vital and predict a poor outcome in COVID-19 patients, especially in severe cases. Endothelial cell activation and dysfunction may play an important role in causing clot formation. More basic and clinical research is warranted to further our understanding of the role of coagulopathy and their possible mechanism in COVID-19 patients.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence has shown that gut dysbacteriosis may play a crucial role in neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the specific mechanisms that link gut microbiota to PD remain unexplored. Given the critical roles of blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction and mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of PD, we aimed to evaluate the interactions among the gut microbiota, BBB, and mitochondrial resistance to oxidation and inflammation in PD. We investigated the effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on the physiopathology of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mice. The aim was to explore the role of fecal microbiota from PD patients and healthy human controls in neuroinflammation, BBB components, and mitochondrial antioxidative capacity via the AMPK/SOD2 pathway. Compared to control mice, MPTP-treated mice exhibited elevated levels of Desulfovibrio, whereas mice given FMT from PD patients exhibited enriched levels of Akkermansia and mice given FMT from healthy humans showed no significant alterations in gut microbiota. Strikingly, FMT from PD patients to MPTP-treated mice significantly aggravated motor impairments, dopaminergic neurodegeneration, nigrostriatal glial activation and colonic inflammation, and inhibited the AMPK/SOD2 signaling pathway. However, FMT from healthy human controls greatly improved the aforementioned MPTP-caused effects. Surprisingly, the MPTP-treated mice displayed a significant loss in nigrostriatal pericytes, which was restored by FMT from healthy human controls. Our findings demonstrate that FMT from healthy human controls can correct gut dysbacteriosis and ameliorate neurodegeneration in the MPTP-induced PD mouse model by suppressing microgliosis and astrogliosis, ameliorating mitochondrial impairments via the AMPK/SOD2 pathway, and restoring the loss of nigrostriatal pericytes and BBB integrity. These findings raise the possibility that the alteration in the human gut microbiota may be a risk factor for PD and provide evidence for potential application of FMT in PD preclinical treatment.",

    "abstract": "Sirtuins (SIRT1-SIRT7), a family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent enzymes, are key regulators of life span and metabolism. In addition to acting as deacetylates, some sirtuins have the properties of deacylase, decrotonylase, adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosyltransferase, lipoamidase, desuccinylase, demalonylase, deglutarylase, and demyristolyase. Mitochondrial dysfunction occurs early on and acts causally in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD). Sirtuins are implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial quality control, which is highly associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. There is growing evidence indicating that sirtuins are promising and well-documented molecular targets for the treatment of mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegenerative disorders by regulating mitochondrial quality control, including mitochondrial biogenesis, mitophagy, mitochondrial fission/fusion dynamics, and mitochondrial unfolded protein responses (mtUPR). Therefore, elucidation of the molecular etiology of sirtuin-mediated mitochondrial quality control points to new prospects for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying sirtuin-mediated mitochondrial quality control remain obscure. In this review, we update and summarize the current understanding of the structure, function, and regulation of sirtuins with an emphasis on the cumulative and putative effects of sirtuins on mitochondrial biology and neurodegenerative diseases, particularly their roles in mitochondrial quality control. In addition, we outline the potential therapeutic applications for neurodegenerative diseases of targeting sirtuin-mediated mitochondrial quality control through exercise training, calorie restriction, and sirtuin modulators in neurodegenerative diseases.",

The former type mainly includes post-stroke pain, post-stroke epilepsy, and post-stroke dementia while the latter one includes post-stroke depression, post-stroke anxiety, post-stroke apathy and post-stroke fatigue. Multiple risk factors are related to these post-stroke neuropsychiatric complications, such as age, gender, lifestyle, stroke type, medication, lesion location, and comorbidities. Recent studies have revealed several critical mechanisms underlying these complications, namely inflammatory response, dysregulation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, cholinergic dysfunction, reduced level of 5-hydroxytryptamine, glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, clinical efforts have successfully given birth to many practical pharmaceutic strategies, such as anti-inflammatory medications, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, as well as diverse rehabilitative modalities to help patients physically and mentally. However, the efficacy of these interventions is still under debate.

It has been well-defined in mitotic cells by various senescent features. Neurons are long-lived post-mitotic cells with special structures and functions. With age, neurons display morphological and functional changes, accompanying alterations in proteostasis, redox balance, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics; however, it is ambiguous whether these neuronal changes belong to the features of neuronal senescence. In this review, we strive to identify and classify changes that are relatively specific to neurons in the aging brain and define them as features of neuronal senescence through comparisons with common senescent features. We also associate them with the functional decline of multiple cellular homeostasis systems, proposing the possibility that these systems are the main drivers of neuronal senescence. We hope this summary will serve as a steppingstone for further inputs on a comprehensive but relatively specific list of phenotypes for neuronal senescence and in particular their underlying molecular events during aging. This will in turn shine light on the association between neuronal senescence and neurodegeneration and lead to the development of strategies to perturb the processes.",

Despite its widespread prevalence, there is currently no cure for AD. It is widely acknowledged that normal synaptic function holds a key role in memory, cognitive abilities, and the interneuronal transfer of information. As AD advances, symptoms including synaptic impairment, decreased synaptic density, and cognitive decline become increasingly noticeable. The importance of glial cells in the formation of synapses, the growth of neurons, brain maturation, and safeguarding the microenvironment of the central nervous system is well recognized. However, during AD progression, overactive glial cells can cause synaptic dysfunction, neuronal death, and abnormal neuroinflammation. Both neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction are present in the early stages of AD. Therefore, focusing on the changes in glia-synapse communication could provide insights into the mechanisms behind AD. In this review, we aim to provide a summary of the role of various glial cells, including microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and oligodendrocyte precursor cells, in regulating synaptic dysfunction. This may offer a new perspective on investigating the underlying mechanisms of AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-dependent neurodegenerative disease characterized by extracellular Amyloid Aβ peptide (Aβ) deposition and intracellular Tau protein aggregation. Glia, especially microglia and astrocytes are core participants during the progression of AD and these cells are the mediators of Aβ clearance and degradation. The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) is a complex interactive network between the gut and brain involved in neurodegeneration. MGBA affects the function of glia in the central nervous system (CNS), and microbial metabolites regulate the communication between astrocytes and microglia; however, whether such communication is part of AD pathophysiology remains unknown. One of the potential links in bilateral gut-brain communication is tryptophan (Trp) metabolism. The microbiota-originated Trp and its metabolites enter the CNS to control microglial activation, and the activated microglia subsequently affect astrocyte functions. The present review highlights the role of MGBA in AD pathology, especially the roles of Trp per se and its metabolism as a part of the gut microbiota and brain communications. We (i) discuss the roles of Trp derivatives in microglia-astrocyte crosstalk from a bioinformatics perspective, (ii) describe the role of glia polarization in the microglia-astrocyte crosstalk and AD pathology, and (iii) summarize the potential of Trp metabolism as a therapeutic target. Finally, we review the role of Trp in AD from the perspective of the gut-brain axis and microglia, as well as astrocyte crosstalk, to inspire the discovery of novel AD therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Aging in the healthy brain is characterized by a low-grade, chronic, and sterile inflammatory process known as neuroinflammaging. This condition, mainly consisting in an up-regulation of the inflammatory response at the brain level, contributes to the pathogenesis of age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Development of this proinflammatory state involves the interaction between genetic and environmental factors, able to induce age-related epigenetic modifications. Indeed, the exposure to environmental compounds, drugs, and infections, can contribute to epigenetic modifications of DNA methylome, histone fold proteins, and nucleosome positioning, leading to epigenetic modulation of neuroinflammatory responses. Furthermore, some epigenetic modifiers, which combine and interact during the life course, can contribute to modeling of epigenome dynamics to sustain, or dampen the neuroinflammatory phenotype. The aim of this review is to summarize current knowledge about neuroinflammaging with a particular focus on epigenetic mechanisms underlying the onset and progression of neuroinflammatory cascades in the central nervous system; furthermore, we describe some diagnostic biomarkers that may contribute to increase diagnostic accuracy and help tailor therapeutic strategies in patients with neurodegenerative diseases.",

The pathogenesis of PSD is not completely clear so far. Neuroinflammation following stroke is one of underlying mechanisms that involves in the pathophysiology of PSD and plays an important function in the development of depression and is regarded as a sign of depression. During the neuroinflammation after ischemic stroke onset, both astrocytes and microglia undergo a series of morphological and functional changes and play pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory effect in the pathological process of stroke. Importantly, astrocytes and microglia exert dual roles in the pathological process of PSD due to the phenotypic transformation.

In this review, an overview is provided on mechanisms underlying ROS generation in endothelial cells and the involved regulatory pathways. Further, we discuss the ROS induced endothelial cell dysfunction and its relationship with atherosclerosis. Current knowledge on ROS-induced endothelial impairment is presented, characterized by decreased NO bioavailability, intracellular dysfunction and ox-LDL accumulation. Furthermore, biomarkers such as oxidative products of lipid, protein, and nucleotide are discussed as measurements for ROS levels. Novel interventions targeting oxidative stress are listed as potential pharmacotherapies in clinical practice.

Excessive iron deposition is caused by leaking hemosiderin which may over-activate ferroptosis pathways, resulting in lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction in cells. Inhibiting ferroptosis after SCI has been shown to aid functional recovery. However, the essential genes involved in cellular ferroptosis following SCI are still unknown. Here we show that <i>Ctsb</i> is a statistical significance gene by collecting multiple transcriptomic profiles and identifying differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes, which are abundantly expressed in myeloid cells after SCI and widely distributed at the epicenter of the injury. The expression score of ferroptosis, calculated by ferroptosis driver/suppressor genes, was high in macrophages. Furthermore, we discovered that inhibiting cathepsin B (CTSB), specifically with a small-molecule drug, CA-074-methyl ester (CA-074-me), reduced lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction in macrophages. We also found that alternatively activated M2-polarized macrophages are more susceptible to hemin-induced ferroptosis. Consequently, CA-074-me could reduce ferroptosis, induce M2 macrophage polarization, and promote the neurological function recovery of mice after SCI. Our study comprehensively analyzed the ferroptosis after SCI from the perspective of multiple transcriptomes and provided a novel molecular target for SCI treatment.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic reprogramming is a defining hallmark of cancer metastasis, warranting thorough exploration. The tumor-promoting function of the \"Warburg Effect\", marked by escalated glycolysis and restrained mitochondrial activity, is widely acknowledged. Yet, the functional significance of mitochondria-mediated oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) during metastasis remains controversial. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are considered metastatic precursors that detach from primary or secondary sites and harbor the potential to seed distant metastases through hematogenous dissemination. A comprehensive metabolic characterization of CTCs faces formidable obstacles, including the isolation of these rare cells from billions of blood cells, coupled with the complexities of <i>ex vivo</i>-culturing of CTC lines or the establishment of CTC-derived xenograft models (CDX). This review summarized the role of the \"Warburg Effect\" in both tumorigenesis and CTC-mediated metastasis. Intriguingly, bioinformatic analysis of single-CTC transcriptomic studies unveils a potential OXPHOS dominance over Glycolysis signature genes across several important cancer types. From these observations, we postulate a potential \"Anti-Warburg Effect\" (AWE) in CTCs—a metabolic shift bridging primary tumors and metastases. The observed AWE could be clinically important as they are significantly correlated with therapeutic response in melanoma and prostate patients. Thus, unraveling dynamic metabolic regulations within CTC populations might reveal an additional layer of regulatory complexities of cancer metastasis, providing an avenue for innovative anti-metastasis therapies.",

The incidence of ALS increases from the age of 40 and peaks between the ages of 65 and 70. Most patients die of respiratory muscle paralysis or lung infections within three to five years of the appearance of symptoms, dealing a huge blow to patients and their families. With aging populations, improved diagnostic methods and changes in reporting criteria, the incidence of ALS is likely to show an upward trend in the coming decades. Despite extensive researches have been done, the cause and pathogenesis of ALS remains unclear. In recent decades, large quantities of studies focusing on gut microbiota have shown that gut microbiota and its metabolites seem to change the evolvement of ALS through the brain-gut-microbiota axis, and in turn, the progression of ALS will exacerbate the imbalance of gut microbiota, thereby forming a vicious cycle. This suggests that further exploration and identification of the function of gut microbiota in ALS may be crucial to break the bottleneck in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. Hence, the current review summarizes and discusses the latest research advancement and future directions of ALS and brain-gut-microbiota axis, so as to help relevant researchers gain correlative information instantly.",

The condition is characterized by a multifaceted pathophysiology that involves aging, oxidative stress, inflammation, vascular dysfunction, and complement activation. The complex interplay of these factors contributes to the initiation and progression of AMD. Current treatments primarily address choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in neovascular AMD. However, the approval of novel drug therapies for the atrophic and more gradual variant, known as geographic atrophy (GA), has recently occurred. In light of the substantial impact of AMD on affected individuals' quality of life and the strain it places on healthcare systems, there is a pressing need for innovative medications.

Regulation of nutrient, water, and ion transport across the BBB is tightly controlled by specialized ion transporters and channels located within its unique cellular components. These dynamic transport processes not only influence the BBB’s structure but also impact vital signaling mechanisms, essential for its optimal function. Disruption in ion, pH, and fluid balance at the BBB is associated with brain pathology and has been implicated in various neurological conditions, including stroke, epilepsy, trauma, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, knowledge gaps exist regarding the impact of ion transport dysregulation on BBB function in neurodegenerative dementias. Several factors contribute to this gap: the complex nature of these conditions, historical research focus on neuronal mechanisms and technical challenges in studying the ion transport mechanisms in <i>in vivo</i> models and the lack of efficient <i>in vitro</i> BBB dementia models. This review provides an overview of current research on the roles of ion transporters and channels at the BBB and poses specific research questions: 1) How are the expression and activity of key ion transporters altered in AD and vascular dementia (VaD); 2) Do these changes contribute to BBB dysfunction and disease progression; and 3) Can restoring ion transport function mitigate BBB dysfunction and improve clinical outcomes. Addressing these gaps will provide a greater insight into the vascular pathology of neurodegenerative disorders.",

Further, it has been implicated in the pathogenesis of developmental disorders and the onset of numerous diseases. Multiple modes of programmed cell death, including apoptosis, pyroptosis, necroptosis, and ferroptosis, have been identified, each with their own unique characteristics and biological implications. In February 2023, Liu Xiaoguang and his team discovered \"disulfidptosis,\" a novel pathway of programmed cell death. Their findings demonstrated that disulfidptosis is triggered in glucose-starved cells exhibiting high expression of a protein called SLC7A11. Furthermore, disulfidptosis is marked by a drastic imbalance in the NADPH/NADP+ ratio and the abnormal accumulation of disulfides like cystine. These changes ultimately lead to the destabilization of the F-actin network, causing cell death. Given that high SLC7A11 expression is a key feature of certain cancers, these findings indicate that disulfidptosis could serve as the basis of innovative anti-cancer therapies. Hence, this review delves into the discovery of disulfidptosis, its underlying molecular mechanisms and metabolic regulation, and its prospective applications in disease treatment.",

    "abstract": "Quercetin (QC), a naturally occurring bioflavonoid found in various fruits and vegetables, possesses many potential health benefits, primarily attributed to its robust antioxidant properties. The generation of oxidative stress in bone cells is a key modulator of their physiological behavior. Moreover, oxidative stress status influences the pathophysiology of mineralized tissues. Increasing scientific evidence demonstrates that manipulating the redox balance in bone cells might be an effective technique for developing bone disease therapies. The QC antioxidant abilities in skeletal muscle significantly enhance muscle regeneration and reduce muscle atrophy. In addition, QC has been shown to have protective effects against oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and matrix degradation in tendons, helping to maintain the structural integrity and functionality of tendons. Thus, the antioxidant properties of QC might be crucial for addressing age-related musculoskeletal disorders like osteoporosis, sarcopenia, and tendon-related inflammatory conditions. Understanding how QC influences redox signaling pathways involved in musculoskeletal disorders, including their effect on bone, muscle, and tendon differentiation, might provide insights into the diverse advantages of QC in promoting tissue regeneration and preventing cellular damage. Therefore, this study reviewed the intricate relationship among oxidative stress, inflammation, and tissue repair, affected by the antioxidative abilities of QC, in age-related musculoskeletal tissues to improve the overall health of bones, muscles, and tendons of the skeletal system. Also, reviewing the ongoing clinical trials of QC for musculoskeletal systems is encouraging. Given the positive effect of QC on musculoskeletal health, further scientific investigations and controlled human intervention studies are necessary to explore the therapeutic potential to its optimum strength.",

    "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive neurodegeneration disease that causes photoreceptor demise and vision impairments. In AMD pathogenesis, the primary death of retinal neurons always leads to the activation of resident microglia. The migration of activated microglia to the ongoing retinal lesion and their morphological transformation from branching to ameboid-like are recognized as hallmarks of AMD pathogenesis. Activated microglia send signals to Müller cells and promote them to react correspondingly to damaging stimulus. Müller cells are a type of neuroglia cells that maintain the normal function of retinal neurons, modulating innate inflammatory responses, and stabilize retinal structure. Activated Müller cells can accelerate the progression of AMD by damaging neurons and blood vessels. Therefore, the crosstalk between microglia and Müller cells plays a homeostatic role in maintaining the retinal environment, and this interaction is complicatedly modulated. In particular, the mechanism of mutual regulation between the two glia populations is complex under pathological conditions.

    "abstract": "Axons are crucial for transmitting neurochemical signals. As organisms age, the ability of neurons to maintain their axons declines; hence, aged axons are more susceptible to damage or dysfunction. Understanding how aging causes axonal vulnerability is crucial for developing strategies to enhance overall resilience of neurons and prevent neuronal deterioration during aging and in age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Increasing levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes oxidative stress - a hallmark of aging and age-related diseases. Despite this association, a causal relationship between oxidative stress and neuronal aging remains unclear, particularly in how subcellular physiology may be affected by ROS. By using Drosophila-derived primary neuronal cultures and a recently developed in vivo neuronal model of aging, which involves the visualisation of Drosophila medulla neurons, we investigated the interplay between oxidative stress, neuronal aging and the microtubule cytoskeleton. Our results showed that oxidative stress is a key driver of axonal and synaptic decay, as shown by an enhanced appearance of axonal swellings, microtubule alterations (in both axons and synapses) and morphological transformation of axonal terminals during aging. We demonstrated that increasing the levels of ROS sensitises microtubule plus end-binding protein 1 (EB1), leading to microtubule defects that effect neuronal integrity. Furthermore, manipulating EB1 proved to be a valuable therapeutic strategy to prevent aging hallmarks enhanced in conditions of elevated ROS. In summary, we demonstrate a mechanistic pathway linking cellular oxidative stress with changes in the microtubule cytoskeleton leading to axonal deterioration during aging and provide evidence of the therapeutic potential of enhancing microtubule plus-end physiology to improve the resilience of axons.",

These nanozymes activate the immune system to specifically recognize and destroy cancer cells. Combined with immunotherapeutic agents, nanozymes can amplify the anti-cancer effectiveness by integrating immune remodeling with immunogenic cell death (ICD). This review offers a thorough discussion about various nanozymes involved in anti-cancer immunity, including those mimicking catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and oxidase (OXD). It also discusses the challenges and future directions for translating nanozyme platforms into clinical applications, enhancing the susceptibility of cancer cells to immunotherapy. Nanozyme-based strategies have substantial potential in oncology, offering new and effective therapeutic options for cancer management.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus often leads to secondary brain disorders, thus increasing the risk of mortality. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a peripheral-central defense mechanism that significantly impacts diabetes-related brain complications. Under hyperglycemic conditions, the BBB undergoes pathological structural alterations, leading to increased permeability and transport dysfunction. Clinically, BBB damage induces diabetes-related brain complications such as cognitive impairment, stroke, and depression. Notably, BBB damage can occur before the onset of disease symptoms in the brain and may serve as a predictor of disease progression and prognosis. Hyperglycemia is the main cause of BBB damage and can induce oxidative stress, inflammatory response, Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) accumulation, and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) signaling axis activation. These factors lead to endothelial dysfunction, disruption of tight junction proteins, loss of pericytes, activation of astrocytes and microglia, disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, alterations in the basement membrane, and an increase in matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Collectively, these processes contribute to brain injury in patients with diabetes. Lifestyle interventions and hypoglycemic, antihypertensive, and lipid-lowering agents play therapeutic roles in BBB damage and diabetes-related brain complications. However, the role of some drugs in this context is controversial and remains known only at the animal and cellular levels. Several studies have investigated the therapeutic potential of targeted nanomedicines and natural compounds; however, it remains challenging to translate their research findings to clinical practice. In conclusion, this review highlights the clinical evidence, pathological mechanisms, and existing treatment options for BBB damage in patients with diabetes-related brain complications. It also demonstrates the potential of targeted nanomedicines and natural compounds, providing a foundation for future research.",

Scientists have endeavored to identify the key molecular switches that drive cognitive decline with advancing age. These newly identified molecules are then targeted as recovery of cognitive aging and related disorders. Cognitive decline during aging is multi-factorial and amongst several factors influencing this trajectory, gene expression changes are pivotal. Identifying these genes would elucidate the neurobiological underpinnings as well as offer clues that make certain individuals resilient to withstand the inevitable age-related deteriorations. Our laboratory has focused on this aspect and investigated a wide spectrum of genes involved in crucial brain functions that attribute to senescence induced cognitive deficits. We have recently identified master switches in the epigenome regulating gene expression alteration during brain aging. Interestingly, these factors when manipulated by chemical or genetic strategies successfully reverse the age-related cognitive impairments. In the present article, we review findings from our laboratory and others combined with supporting literary evidences on molecular switches of brain aging and their potential as recovery targets.",

This study set out to examine the bidirectional longitudinal association between CVD and frailty over an extended period of time. Data are from 1432 older adults (aged 65-88yrs) of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA), who were followed for 17 years. At baseline and follow-up, CVD was assessed through self-report, medication use and medical records, and classified as angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, heart failure (HF), stroke, and peripheral artery disease. Throughout the study, frailty was assessed using Fried's frailty criteria. Cox regression models showed that patients with HF had an increased frailty risk (HR 2.7; 95%CI: 1.5-5.1) after a median follow-up of 8.4 yrs. This finding was independent of potential confounders (age, sex, several comorbidities). Examinations of the reverse association revealed that frail older adults were not at risk of incident CVD. Of all older adults with CVD, those with HF have an increased risk of frailty and frail older adults do not have an increased risk of CVD. Our findings emphasize the need for cardiac rehabilitation programs evaluating the effect of physical exercise programs in order to prevent frailty and therewith improve quality of life and independence of care in CVD patients.",

Fibrosis is the hardening, overgrowth and scarring of various tissues characterized by the accumulation of extracellular matrix components. Aging is an important predisposing factor common for fibrotic heart and respiratory disease. Age-related processes such as senescence, inflammaging, autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction are interconnected biological processes that diminish the regenerative capacity of the aged heart and lung and have been shown to play a crucial role in cardiac fibrosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. This review focuses on these four processes of aging in relation to their role in fibrosis. It has long been established that the heart and lung are linked both functionally and anatomically when it comes to health and disease, with an ever-expanding aging population, the incidence of fibrotic disease and therefore the number of fibrosis-related deaths will continue to rise. There are currently no feasible therapies to treat the effects of chronic fibrosis therefore highlighting the importance of exploring the processes of aging and its role in inducing and exacerbating fibrosis of each organ. The focus of this review may help to highlight potential avenues of therapeutic exploration.",

The free radical theory of aging inspired many studies using reactive species scavengers such as alpha-tocopherol, ascorbate and coenzyme Q to suppress the initiation of oxidative stress. However, clinical trials have had limited success in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. We ascribe this to the emerging literature which suggests that the oxidative stress hypothesis does not encompass the role of reactive species in cell signaling and therefore the interception with reactive species with antioxidant supplementation may result in disruption of redox signaling. In addition, the accumulation of redox modified proteins or organelles cannot be reversed by oxidant intercepting antioxidants and must then be removed by alternative mechanisms. We have proposed that autophagy serves this essential function in removing damaged or dysfunctional proteins and organelles thus preserving neuronal function and survival. In this review, we will highlight observations regarding the impact of autophagy regulation on cellular bioenergetics and survival in response to reactive species or reactive species generating compounds, and in response to proteotoxic stress.",

A c-f PWV value ≥ 10 m/s is currently defined as a threshold for increased cardiovascular risk, based on consensus statement from 2012.

    "abstract": "Hypoxia is an environmental stress at high altitude and underground conditions but it is also present in many chronic age-related diseases, where blood flow into tissues is impaired. The oxygen-sensing system stimulates gene expression protecting tissues against hypoxic insults. Hypoxia stabilizes the expression of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1α (HIF-1α), which controls the expression of hundreds of survival genes related to e.g. enhanced energy metabolism and autophagy. Moreover, many stress-related signaling mechanisms, such as oxidative stress and energy metabolic disturbances, as well as the signaling cascades via ceramide, mTOR, NF-κB, and TGF-β pathways, can also induce the expression of HIF-1α protein to facilitate cell survival in normoxia. Hypoxia is linked to prominent epigenetic changes in chromatin landscape. Screening studies have indicated that the stabilization of HIF-1α increases the expression of distinct histone lysine demethylases (KDM). HIF-1α stimulates the expression of KDM3A, KDM4B, KDM4C, and KDM6B, which enhance gene transcription by demethylating H3K9 and H3K27 sites (repressive epigenetic marks). In addition, HIF-1α induces the expression of KDM2B and KDM5B, which repress transcription by demethylating H3K4me2,3 sites (activating marks). Hypoxia-inducible KDMs support locally the gene transcription induced by HIF-1α, although they can also control genome-wide chromatin landscape, especially KDMs which demethylate H3K9 and H3K27 sites. These epigenetic marks have important role in the control of heterochromatin segments and 3D folding of chromosomes, as well as the genetic loci regulating cell type commitment, proliferation, and cellular senescence, e.g. the INK4 box. A chronic stimulation of HIF-1α can provoke tissue fibrosis and cellular senescence, which both are increasingly present with aging and age-related diseases. We will review the regulation of HIF-1α-dependent induction of KDMs and clarify their role in pathological processes emphasizing that long-term stress-related insults can impair the maintenance of chromatin landscape and provoke cellular senescence and tissue fibrosis associated with aging and age-related diseases.",

However, the roles of miR-181c in stroke are not known. The clinical relevance of miR-181c in acute stroke patients was evaluated by real-time PCR and correlation analyses. Proliferation and apoptosis of BV2 microglial cells and Neuro-2a cells cultured separately or together under oxidative stress or inflammation were assessed with the Cell Counting Kit-8 and by flow cytometry, respectively. Cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in C57/BL6 mice, and cerebral infarct volume, microglia activation, and expression of pro-apoptotic factors were evaluated by 2,3,5-triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride staining, immunocytochemistry, and western blotting, respectively. Plasma levels of miR-181c were decreased in stroke patients relative to healthy individuals, and were positively correlated with neutrophil number and blood platelet count and negatively correlated with lymphocyte number. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment inhibited BV2 microglia proliferation without inducing apoptosis, while miR-181c reduced proliferation but increased the apoptosis of these cells with or without LPS/H2O2 treatment. LPS/H2O2 induced apoptosis in Neuro-2a cells co-cultured with BV2 cells, an effect that was potentiated by miR-181c. In the MCAO model, miR-181c agomir modestly increased infarct volume, markedly decreased microglia activation and B cell lymphoma-2 expression, and increased the levels of pro-apoptotic proteins in the ischemic brain. Our data indicate that miR-181c contributes to brain injury in acute ischemic stroke by promoting apoptosis of microglia and neurons via modulation of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins.",

    "abstract": "As the population ages, the medical and socioeconomic impact of age-related bone disorders will further increase. An imbalance between osteogenesis and adipogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can lead to various bone and metabolic diseases such as osteoporosis. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying MSC osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation is important for the discovery of novel therapeutic paradigms for these diseases. miR-10b has been widely reported in tumorigenesis, cancer invasion and metastasis. However, the effects and potential mechanisms of miR-10b in the regulation of MSC adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation have not been explored. In this study, we found that the expression of miR-10b was positively correlated with bone formation marker genes ALP, RUNX2 and OPN, and negatively correlated with adipogenic markers CEBPα, PPARγ and AP2 in clinical osteoporosis samples. Overexpression of miR-10b enhanced osteogenic differentiation and inhibited adipogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADSCs) <i>in vitro</i>, whereas downregulation of miR-10b reversed these effects. Furthermore, miR-10b promoted ectopic bone formation <i>in vivo</i>. Target prediction and dual luciferase reporter assays identified SMAD2 as a potential target of miR-10b. Silencing endogenous SMAD2 expression in hADSCs enhanced osteogenesis but repressed adipogenesis. Pathway analysis indicated that miR-10b promotes osteogenic differentiation and bone formation via the TGF-β signaling pathway, while suppressing adipogenic differentiation may be primarily mediated by other pathways. Taken together, our findings imply that miR-10b acts as a critical regulator for balancing osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of hADSCs by repressing SMAD2 and partly through the TGF-β pathway. Our study suggests that miR-10b is a novel target for controlling bone and metabolic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Superoxide is a precursor of many free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in biological systems. It has been shown that superoxide regulates major epigenetic processes of DNA methylation, histone methylation, and histone acetylation. We suggested that superoxide, being a radical anion and a strong nucleophile, could participate in DNA methylation and histone methylation and acetylation through mechanism of nucleophilic substitution and free radical abstraction. In nucleophilic reactions superoxide is able to neutralize positive charges of methyl donors S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) and acetyl-coenzyme A (AcCoA) enhancing their nucleophilic capacity or to deprotonate cytosine. In the reversed free radical reactions of demethylation and deacetylation superoxide is formed catalytically by the (Tet) family of dioxygenates and converted into the iron form of hydroxyl radical with subsequent oxidation and final eradication of methyl substituents. Double role of superoxide in these epigenetic processes might be of importance for understanding of ROS effects under physiological and pathological conditions including cancer and aging.",

It affects 0.8-3.0% aging Asian and 0.1-1.7% aging European Caucasian. The ossified ligament compresses nerve roots in the spinal cord and causes serious neurological problems such as myelopathy and radiculopathy. Research in understanding pathogenesis of OPLL over the past several decades have revealed many genetic and non-genetic factors contributing to the development and progress of OPLL. The characterizations of aberrant signaling of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), and the pathological phenotypes of OPLL-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have provided new insights on the molecular mechanisms underlying OPLL. This paper reviews the recent progress in understanding the pathophysiology of OPLL and proposes future research directions on OPLL.",

    "abstract": "In Lebanon, data stemming from national cross-sectional surveys indicated significant increasing trends in the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and associated behavioral and age-related risk factors. To our knowledge, no data are available on relative telomere length (RTL) as a potential biomarker for age-related diseases in a Lebanese population. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether there is an association between RTL and demographic characteristics, lifestyle habits and diseases in the Lebanese. This was a cross-sectional study of 497 Lebanese subjects. Peripheral blood RTL was measured by amplifying telomere and single copy gene using real-time PCR. Mean ± SD RTL was 1.42 ± 0.83, and it was categorized into 3 tertiles. Older age (P=0.002) and wider waist circumference (WC) (P=0.001) were statistically significantly associated with shorter RTL. Multinomial logistic regression showed that subjects who had some level of sleeping difficulty had a statistically significantly shorter RTL when compared to those with no sleeping difficulties at all [OR (95% CI): 2.01 (1.11-3.62) in the first RTL tertile]. Importantly, statistically significantly shorter RTL was found with every additional 10 cm of WC [OR (95% CI): 1.30 (1.11-1.52) for first RTL tertile]. In addition, and after performing the multivariate logistic regression and adjusting for \"predictors\" of RTL, the odds of having hypertension or being treated for hypertension were higher in patients who had shorter RTL: OR (95% CI): 2.45 (1.36-4.44) and 2.28 (1.22-4.26) in the first RTL tertiles respectively with a similar trend, though not statistically significant, in the second RTL tertiles. This is the first study in Lebanon to show an association between age, central obesity, poor sleep and hypertension and RTL. It is hoped that telomere length measurement be potentially used as a biomarker for biological age and age-related diseases and progression in the Lebanese.",

To understand the underlying processes, and to foster the development of targeted interventions towards increasing one’s health, there is an urgent need to find a broadly acceptable and useful definition of health, based on a list of (molecular) features; to operationalize features of health so that it can be measured; to identify predictive biomarkers and (molecular) pathways of health; and to suggest interventions, such as nutrition and exercise, targeted at putative causal pathways and processes. Based on a survey of the literature, we propose to define <i>health</i> as a state of an individual characterized by the <i>core features</i> of physiological, cognitive, physical and reproductive function, and a lack of disease. We further define <i>aging</i> as the aggregate of all processes in an individual that reduce its <i>wellbeing</i>, that is, its health or survival or both. We define <i>biomarkers of health</i> by their attribute of predicting future health better than chronological age. We define healthspan pathways as molecular features of health that relate to each other by belonging to the same molecular pathway. Our conceptual framework may integrate diverse operationalizations of health and guide precision prevention efforts.",

Hyperglycemia in diabetes could dramatically increase neuronal glucose levels which leads to neuronal damage, a phenomenon referred to as glucose neurotoxicity. On the other hand, the impact of hyperglycemia on astrocytes has been less explored. Astrocytes play important roles in brain energy metabolism through neuron-astrocyte coupling. As the component of blood brain barrier, glucose might be primarily transported into astrocytes, hence, impose direct impact on astrocyte metabolism and function. In the present study, we determined the effect of high glucose on the energy metabolism and function of primary astrocytes. Hyperglycemia level glucose (25 mM) induced cell cycle arrest and inhibited proliferation and migration of primary astrocytes. Consistently, high glucose decreased cyclin D1 and D3 expression. High glucose enhanced glycolytic metabolism, increased ATP and glycogen content in primary astrocytes. In addition, high glucose activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway in astrocytes. In summary, our <i>in vitro</i> study indicated that hyperglycemia might impact astrocyte energy metabolism and function phenotype. Our study provides a potential mechanism which may underlie the diabetic cerebral neuropathy and warrant further <i>in vivo</i> study to determine the effect of hyperglycemia on astrocyte metabolism and function.",

The entrainment effect has been suggested to introduce neurophysiological changes, alleviate auditory-motor coupling and reduce cognitive-motor interferences. However, a consensus as to its influence over aging gait is still warranted. A systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out to analyze the effects of rhythmic auditory cueing on spatiotemporal gait parameters among healthy young and elderly participants. This systematic identification of published literature was performed according to PRISMA guidelines, from inception until May 2017, on online databases: Web of science, PEDro, EBSCO, MEDLINE, Cochrane, EMBASE, and PROQUEST. Studies were critically appraised using PEDro scale. Of 2789 records, 34 studies, involving 854 (499 young/355 elderly) participants met our inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis revealed enhancements in spatiotemporal parameters of gait i.e. gait velocity (Hedge's g: 0.85), stride length (0.61), and cadence (1.1), amongst both age groups. This review, for the first time, evaluates the effects of auditory entrainment on aging gait and discusses its implications under higher and lower information processing constraints. Clinical implications are discussed with respect to applications of auditory entrainment in rehabilitation settings.",

    "abstract": "Owing to excellent therapeutic potential, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are gaining increasing popularity with researchers worldwide for applications in tissue engineering, and in treatment of inflammation-related and age-related disorders. However, the senescence of MSCs over passaging has limited their clinical application owing to adverse effect on physiological function maintenance of tissues as well as disease treatment. An inflammatory microenvironment is one of the key contributors to MSC senescence, resulting in low regeneration efficiency. Therefore, MSCs with high resistance to cellular senescence would be a benefit for tissue regeneration. Toward this end, we analyzed the senescence properties of different types of stem cells during culture and under inflammation, including dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs), bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs), and adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs). Overall, the DPSCs had higher proliferation rates, lower cellular senescence, and enhanced osteogenesis maintenance compared to those of non-dental MSCs cultured from passage three to six. The expression profiles of genes related to apoptosis, cell cycle, and cellular protein metabolic process (contributing to the cell self-renewal ability and metabolic processes) significantly differed between DPSCs and BMMSCs at passage three. Moreover, DPSCs were superior to BMMSCs with regards to resistance to lipopolysaccharide-induced apoptosis and senescence, with enhanced osteogenesis in vitro, and showed improved periodontal regeneration after injection in a miniature pig periodontitis model in vivo. Overall, the present study indicates that DPSCs show superior resistance to subculture and inflammation-induced senescence and would be suitable stem cells for tissue engineering with inflammation.",

Potential pathophysiological factors of frailty present in patients with CKD and are accentuated in patients with ESRD. The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence and predictors of frailty in Japanese HD patients. This study was a multicenter, cross-sectional and observational investigation conducted at 6 institutions. To evaluate frailty, the modified Fried's frailty phenotype adjusted for Japanese as the self-reported questionnaire was used. Of the 542 patients visiting each institution, 388 were enrolled in this study. In total, 26.0% of participants were categorized as not-frailty, 52.6% as pre-frailty and 21.4% as frailty. The prevalence of frailty increased steadily with age and was more prevalent in females than in males and the subjects with frailty received polypharmacy. A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the factors independently associated with frailty were the following: female gender (odds ratio [OR] = 3.661, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.398-9.588), age (OR = 1.065, 95% CI 1.014-1.119), age ≥ 75 years old (OR = 4.892, 95% CI 1.715-13.955), body mass index (BMI) < 18.5 (OR = 0.110, 95% CI 0.0293-0.416), number of medications being taken (OR = 1.351, 95% CI 1.163-1.570), diabetes mellitus (DM) (OR = 2.765, 95% CI 1.081-7.071) and MNA-SF ≤ 11 (OR = 7.405, 95% CI 2.732-20.072). Frailty was associated with the accumulation of risk factors. The prevalence of frailty in Japanese patients with HD was relatively lower than that previously reported in Western developed countries; however, it was extremely high compared to the general population regardless of age. Our findings suggest that frailty might be associated with an increase in the prevalence of adverse health outcomes in patients with HD.",

    "abstract": "Cell cycle dysregulation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Specialised function obligates neuronal cells to subsist in a quiescent state of cell cycle once differentiated and therefore the circumstances and mechanisms underlying aberrant cell cycle activation in post-mitotic neurons in physiological and disease conditions remains an intriguing area of research. There is a strict requirement of concurrence to cell cycle regulation for neurons to ensure intracellular biochemical conformity as well as interrelationship with other cells within neural tissues. This review deliberates on various mechanisms underlying cell cycle regulation in neuronal cells and underscores potential implications of their non-compliance in neural pathology. Recent research suggests that successful duplication of genetic material without subsequent induction of mitosis induces inherent molecular flaws that eventually assert as apoptotic changes. The consequences of anomalous cell cycle activation and subsequent apoptosis are demonstrated by the increased presence of molecular stress response and apoptotic markers. This review delineates cell cycle events under normal physiological conditions and deficits amalgamated by alterations in protein levels and signalling pathways associated with cell-division are analysed. Cell cycle regulators essentially, cyclins, CDKs, cip/kip family of inhibitors, caspases, bax and p53 have been identified to be involved in impaired cell cycle regulation and associated with neural pathology. The pharmacological modulators of cell cycle that are shown to impart protection in various animal models of neurological deficits are summarised. Greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms that are indispensable to cell cycle regulation in neurons in health and disease conditions will facilitate targeted drug development for neuroprotection.",

Compared with the ND, the KD improved glycemic control and protected against diabetic cardiomyopathy in db/db mice, and improved mitochondrial function, as well as reduced oxidative stress were observed in hearts. In addition, KD treatment exerted an anti-apoptotic effect in the heart of db/db mice. Further data showed that the PI3K/Akt pathway was involved in this protective effect.

Laparoscopy places different physiologic demands on the body than in open surgery. PubMed was searched for evidence related to the use of laparoscopy in the elderly population to treat common surgical pathologies. Randomized trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses were preferred. Currently, over 40% of all surgeries performed in the U.S. are on patients older than 65 years. By the end of the 21st century, Americans are expected to live 20 years longer than the current average. However, elderly patients clearly show higher rates of surgical morbidity and mortality overall. Laparoscopic techniques show decreased wound complications, post-operative ileus, intraoperative blood loss, and reduced need for post-operative rehabilitation. In conclusion, laparoscopic surgery is safe in the elderly population and affords multiple advantages including decreased pain and convalescence. However, the physiology of laparoscopy places demands on elderly patients that typically present with more medical comorbidities.",

Complicated alterations of structure and function in the vasculature are linked with aging hence, understanding the underlying mechanisms of age-induced vascular pathophysiological changes holds possibilities for developing clinical diagnostic methods and new therapeutic strategies. Here, we discuss the underlying molecular mediators that could be involved in vascular aging, e.g., the renin-angiotensin system and pro-inflammatory factors, metalloproteinases, calpain-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and TGFβ-1 as well as the potential roles of testosterone and estrogen. We then relate all of these to clinical manifestations such as vascular dementia and stroke in addition to reviewing the existing clinical measurements and potential interventions for age-related vascular dysfunction.",

In this study, miR-19a-3p was obviously downregulated in BMSCs from aged humans and mice.

Hoxa5 was significantly downregulated in the BMSCs from aged mice and contribute to miR-19a-3p-induced osteoblast differentiation as a direct target gene of miR-19a-3p. Furthermore, lncRNA Xist was found as a sponge of miR-19a-3p to repress BMSCs osteogenic differentiation.

Eighty-seven CSVD patients were recruited. Plasma Lp-PLA2 and SOD were determined, and cognitive status was measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The severity of white matter hypoerintensities (WMHs) in CSVD patients was rated according to Fazekas scales, and Lp-PLA2/SOD levels and MMSE/MoCA were compared. Multiple linear regressions were used to evaluate the relationship between Lp-PLA2 and SOD and the cognitive impairment. Ordinal logistic regression and generalized linear models (OLRGLMs) were applied to confirm whether Lp-PLA2 and SOD are independent risk factors for cognitive impairment in CVSD. Lp-PLA2 and SOD with mild or severe cognitive impairment were lower than those with normal congnition. Lp-PLA2 and SOD in CSVD patients with severe WMHs were significantly lower than those with mild or moderate WMH lesions. We noted positive linear associations of Lp-PLA and SOD with cognitive impairment in CSVD, independent of LDL-C. OLRGLMs confirmed that Lp-PLA2 and SOD were independent risk factors of cognitive impairment in CSVD. Lp-PLA2 and SOD are independently associated with cognitive impairment and WMH lesion, and may be useful for the rapid evaluation of cognitive impairment in CSVD.

Here, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of published clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of stem cell therapy for both type 1 DM (T1DM) and type 2 DM (T2DM). The PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, and databases were searched up to November 2018. We employed a fixed-effect model using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) when no statistically significant heterogeneity existed. Otherwise, a random-effects statistical model was used. Twenty-one studies met our inclusion criteria: ten T1DM studies including 226 patients and eleven T2DM studies including 386 patients. Stem cell therapy improved C-peptide levels (mean difference (MD), 0.41; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.76) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c; MD, -3.46; 95% CI, -6.01 to -0.91) for T1DM patients. For T2DM patients, stem cell therapy improved C-peptide levels (MD, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.59), HbA1c (MD, -0.87; 95% CI, -1.37 to -0.37) and insulin requirements (MD, -35.76; 95% CI, -40.47 to -31.04). However, there was no significant change in fasting plasma glucose levels (MD, -0.52; 95% CI, -1.38 to 0.34). Subgroup analyses showed significant HbA1c and C-peptide improvements in patients with T1DM treated with bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (BM-HSCs), while there was no significant change in the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) group. In T2DM, HbA1c and insulin requirements decreased significantly after MSC transplantation, and insulin requirements and C-peptide levels were significantly improved after bone marrow mononuclear cell (BM-MNC) treatment. Stem cell therapy is a relatively safe and effective method for selected individuals with DM. The data showed that BM-HSCs are superior to MSCs in the treatment of T1DM. In T2DM, MSC and BM-MNC transplantation showed favorable therapeutic effects.",

Insightful understanding of correlation of inflammatory mediators and stroke outcome may provide new biomarkers or therapeutic approaches for ischemic stroke. Here, we prospectively recruited 180 first-ever AIS patients within 72 hrs after stroke onset. We used the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) to quantify stroke severity and modified Rankin scale (mRS) to assess the 3-month outcome for AIS patients. Initially, we screened 35 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors in sera from 75 AIS patients and control subjects. Cytokines that were of interest were further investigated in the 180 AIS patients and 14 heathy controls. We found that IL-1RA, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, IL-15, EGF, G-CSF, Flt-3L, GM-CSF and Fractalkine levels were significantly decreased in severe stroke patients. In particular, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-5, IL-7, IL-9, IL-10, IL-15, G-CSF and GM-CSF were significantly reduced in AIS patients with poor outcome, compared to those with good prognosis. IL-6 was notably higher in the poor outcome group. Only IL-9 level decreased in the large infarct volume group. After adjusting for confounders, we found that IL-5 was an independent protective factor for prognosis in AIS patients with an adjusted OR of 0.042 (P = 0.007), whereas IL-6 was an independent risk predictor for AIS patients with an adjusted OR of 1.293 (P = 0.003). Our study suggests the levels of serum cytokines are related to stroke severity, short-term prognosis and cerebral infarct volume in AIS patients.",

C1 is the initial responder of classical pathway of the innate immune system. C1 is comprised of C1q, C1r, and C1s. Among them, C1q is known to interact with diverse ligands, which can perform various functions in physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Because C1q participates in the clearance of pathogens, its interaction with novel receptors is expected to facilitate apoptosis induction, which could prevent the onset or progression of neurodegenerative diseases and could delay the aging process. Because senescence-associated secreting phenotype determinants are generally inflammatory cytokines or immune factors to activate immune cells. In the central nervous system, C1q has diverse neuroprotective roles against pathogens and inflammation. Most of neurodegenerative diseases show region specific pathology feature in the brain. It has been suggested the evidences that the active site and amount of C1q may be disease specific. This review considers currently the emerging and under-recognized roles of C1q in neurodegeneration and highlights the need for further research to clarify these roles. Future studies on the roles of C1q in regulating disease progression should consider these aspects, including the age-dependent onset time of each neurodegenerative disease progression.",

Mitochondrial damage induced by the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) results in myocardial injury with a diabetic state. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of exogenous H2S on mitophagy formation in diabetic cardiomyopathy. In this study, we found that exogenous H2S could improve cardiac functions, reduce mitochondrial fragments and ROS levels, enhance mitochondrial respiration chain activities and inhibit mitochondrial apoptosis in the hearts of db/db mice. Our results showed that exogenous H2S facilitated parkin translocation into mitochondria and promoted mitophagy formation in the hearts of db/db mice. Our studies further revealed that the ubiquitination level of cytosolic parkin was increased and the expression of USP8, a deubiquitinating enzyme, was decreased in db/db cardiac tissues. S-sulfhydration is a novel posttranslational modification of specific cysteine residues on target proteins by H2S. Our results showed that the S-sulfhydration level of USP8 was obviously decreased in vivo and in vitro under hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia, however, exogenous H2S could reverse this effect and promote USP8/parkin interaction. Dithiothreitol, a reducing agent that reverses sulfhydration-mediated covalent modification, increased the ubiquitylation level of parkin, abolished the effects of exogenous H2S on USP8 deubiquitylation and suppressed the interaction of USP8 with parkin in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes treated with high glucose, oleate and palmitate. Our findings suggested that H2S promoted mitophagy formation by increasing S-sulfhydration of USP8, which enhanced deubiquitination of parkin through the recruitment of parkin in mitochondria.",

    "abstract": "It is increasingly understood that in the aging brain, especially in the case of patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases, some fatty acids at pathologically high concentrations exert detrimental activities. To study such activities, we here analyze genetic diseases, which are due to compromised metabolism of specific fatty acids, either the branched-chain phytanic acid or very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). Micromolar concentrations of phytanic acid or of VLCFAs disturb the integrity of neural cells by impairing Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, enhancing oxidative stress or de-energizing mitochondria. Finally, these combined harmful activities accelerate cell death. Mitochondria are more severely targeted by phytanic acid than by VLCFAs. The insertion of VLCFAs into the inner membrane distorts the arrangement of membrane constituents and their functional interactions. Phytanic acid exerts specific protonophoric activity, induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and reduces ATP generation. A clear inhibition of the Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity by phytanic acid has also been reported. In addition to the instantaneous effects, a chronic exposure of brain cells to low micromolar concentrations of phytanic acid may produce neuronal damage in Refsum disease by altering epigenetic transcriptional regulation. Myelin-producing oligodendrocytes respond with particular sensitivity to VLCFAs. Deleterious activity of VLCFAs on energy-dependent mitochondrial functions declines with increasing the hydrocarbon chain length (C22:0 > C24:0 > C26:0). In contrast, the reverse sequence holds true for cell death induction by VLCFAs (C22:0 < C24:0 < C26:0). In adrenoleukodystrophy, the uptake of VLCFAs by peroxisomes is impaired by defects of the ABCD1 transporter. Studying mitochondria from ABCD1-deficient and wild-type mice proves that the energy-dependent functions are not altered in the disease model. Thus, a defective ABCD1 apparently exerts no obvious adaptive pressure on mitochondria. Further research has to elucidate the detailed mechanistic basis for the failures causing fatty acid-mediated neurodegeneration and should help to provide possible therapeutic interventions.",

It seems that sex hormones could be potential contributors for gender differences in skeletal muscle and age-related sarcopenia. In addition, skeletal muscle and the development of sarcopenia are influenced by gut microbiota, which in turn is affected by WP or RT. Gut microbiota may be a key factor for WP and/or RT against age-related sarcopenia.

This review highlights recent advances in the identification of the aberrantly expressed miRNAs and lncRNAs in circulatory network for detection of AD. We summarized the abnormal expressed miRNAs in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and detailed discussed the functions and molecular mechanism of serum or plasma miRNAs-miR-195, miR-155, miR-34a, miR-9, miR-206, miR-125b and miR-29 in the regulation of AD progression. In addition, we also elaborated the role of circulating lncRNA major including beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and its antisense lncRNA BACE1-AS in AD pathological advancement. In brief, confirming the aberrantly expressed circulating miRNAs and lncRNAs will provide an effective testing tools for treatment of AD in the future.",

    "abstract": "Sestrins (Sesns), including Sesn1, Sesn2, and Sesn3, are cysteine sulfinyl reductases that play critical roles in the regulation of peroxide signaling and oxidant defense. Sesn2 is thought to regulate cell growth, metabolism, and survival response to various stresses, and act as a positive regulator of autophagy. The anti-oxidative and anti-aging roles of Sesn2 have been the focus of many recent studies. The role of Sesn2 in cellular metabolism and cardiovascular and age-related diseases must be analyzed and discussed. In this review, we discuss the physiological and pathophysiological roles and signaling pathways of Sesn2 in different stress-related conditions, such as oxidative stress, genotoxic stress, and hypoxia. Sesn2 is also involved in aging, cancer, diabetes, and ischemic heart disease. Understanding the actions of Sesn2 in cell metabolism and age-related diseases will provide new evidence for future experimental research and aid in the development of novel therapeutic strategies for Sesn2-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease in which genetic factors contribute approximately 70% of etiological effects. Studies have found many significant genetic and environmental factors, but the pathogenesis of AD is still unclear. With the application of microarray and next-generation sequencing technologies, research using genetic data has shown explosive growth. In addition to conventional statistical methods for the processing of these data, artificial intelligence (AI) technology shows obvious advantages in analyzing such complex projects. This article first briefly reviews the application of AI technology in medicine and the current status of genetic research in AD. Then, a comprehensive review is focused on the application of AI in the genetic research of AD, including the diagnosis and prognosis of AD based on genetic data, the analysis of genetic variation, gene expression profile, gene-gene interaction in AD, and genetic analysis of AD based on a knowledge base. Although many studies have yielded some meaningful results, they are still in a preliminary stage. The main shortcomings include the limitations of the databases, failing to take advantage of AI to conduct a systematic biology analysis of multilevel databases, and lack of a theoretical framework for the analysis results. Finally, we outlook the direction of future development. It is crucial to develop high quality, comprehensive, large sample size, data sharing resources; a multi-level system biology AI analysis strategy is one of the development directions, and computational creativity may play a role in theory model building, verification, and designing new intervention protocols for AD.",

    "abstract": "Adropin is a peptide highly expressed in the brain. Emerging evidence indicates that low plasma levels of adropin are closely associated with aging and endothelial dysfunction. We hypothesized that aging reduces adropin levels in the brain, which correlates with reduced endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and increased oxidative stress associated with age-related endothelial dysfunction. Cortical brain tissue and plasma were collected from young (10-12 weeks old) and aged (18-20 months old) male Sprague-Dawley naïve rats. Using RT-qPCR, we quantified the mRNA levels of the <i>energy homeostasis associated (Enho)</i> gene encoding for adropin. Western blotting was utilized to measure adropin and markers of endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress in the brain tissue. Levels of adropin in plasma were measured using an ELISA kit. Compared to young rats, both <i>Enho</i> mRNA and protein levels were dramatically reduced in the aged rat brain, which was accompanied by a significant reduction in plasma adropin levels in aged compared to young rats. Additionally, total and phosphorylated levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) were significantly decreased in aged rat brains and were associated with dramatically increased gp91<sup>phox</sup>-containing NADPH oxidase (a major source of free radicals) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), a lipid peroxidation marker. Brain levels of Akt and caveolin-1 were significantly reduced in aged rats compared with young animals. Collectively, these findings indicate that adropin levels negatively correlate with markers of endothelial dysfunction and oxidative injury, which raises the possibility that loss of brain adropin might play a role in the pathogenesis and development of aging-associated cerebrovascular dysfunction.",

Despite much research on the pathogenesis of AD, the neuropathological mechanisms remain obscure and current treatments have proven ineffective. In the past decades, transgenic rodent models have been used to try to unravel this disease, which is crucial for early diagnosis and the assessment of disease-modifying compounds. In this review, we focus on transgenic rodent models used to study amyloid-beta pathology in AD. We also discuss their possible use as promising tools for AD research. There is still no effective treatment for AD and the development of potent therapeutics are urgently needed. Many molecular pathways are susceptible to AD, ranging from neuroinflammation, immune response, and neuroplasticity to neurotrophic factors. Studying these pathways may shed light on AD pathophysiology as well as provide potential targets for the development of more effective treatments. This review discusses the advantages and limitations of these models and their potential therapeutic implications for AD.",

Additionally, recent studies reported improved respiratory activity after intravenous administration of MSCs into patients affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) suggesting their role as anti-viral therapy. Severe COVID-19 patients usually progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, metabolic acidosis that is difficult to correct, coagulation dysfunction, multiple organ failure, and even death in a short period after onset. Currently, there is still a lack of clinically effective drugs for such patients. The high secretory activity, the immune-modulatory effect, and the homing ability make MSCs and in particular AD-MSCs both a potential tool for the anti-viral drug-delivery in the virus microenvironment and potential cellular therapy. AD-MSCs as the most important exponent of MSCs are expected to reduce the risk of complications and death of patients due to their strong anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory capabilities, which can improve microenvironment, promote neovascularization and enhance tissue repair capabilities. In this literature review, the role of regenerative strategies through MSCs, AD-MSCs, and adipocyte-secreted exosomal microRNAs (A-SE-miRs) as a potential antiviral therapy was reported, comparing the results found with current research progress on drugs and vaccines in COVID-19 disease.",

    "abstract": "The expending of elderly population worldwide has resulted in a dramatic rise in the incidence of chronic diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Inadequate understanding of the mechanisms underlying AD has hampered the development of efficient tools for definitive diagnosis and curative interventions. Previous studies have attempted to discover reliable biomarkers of AD, but these biomarkers can only be measured through invasive (neuropathological markers in cerebrospinal fluid) or expensive (positron emission tomography scanning or magnetic resonance imaging) techniques. Metabolomics is a high-throughput technology that can detect and catalog large numbers of small metabolites and may be a useful tool for characterization of AD and identification of biomarkers. In this study, we used ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry based untargeted metabolomics to measure the concentrations of plasma metabolites in a cohort of subjects with AD (n=44) and cognitively normal controls (Ctrl, n=94). The AD group showed marked reductions in levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, acyl-carnitines, degradation products of tryptophan, and elevated levels of bile acids compared to the Ctrl group. We then validated the results using an independent cohort that included subjects with AD (n=30), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n=13), healthy controls (n=43), and non-AD neurological disease controls (NDC, n=31). We identified five metabolites comprising cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, allocholic acid, indolelactic acid, and tryptophan that were able to distinguish patients with AD from both Ctrl and NDC with satisfactory sensitivity and specificity. The concentrations of these metabolites were significantly correlated with disease severity. Our results also suggested that altered bile acid profiles in AD and MCI might indicate early risk for the development of AD. These findings may allow for development of new approaches for diagnosis of AD and may provide novel insights into AD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Heterogenous clinical presentations of Parkinson’s disease have aroused several attempts in its subtyping for the purpose of strategic implementation of treatment in order to maximise therapeutic effects. Apart from <i>a priori</i> classifications based purely on motor features, cluster analysis studies have achieved little success in receiving widespread adoption. <i>A priori</i> classifications demonstrate that their chosen factors, whether it be age or certain motor symptoms, do have an influence on subtypes. However, the cluster analysis approach is able to integrate these factors and other clinical features to produce subtypes. Differences in inclusion criteria from datasets, in variable selection and in methodology between cluster analysis studies have made it difficult to compare the subtypes. This has impeded such subtypes from clinical applications. This review analysed existing subtypes of Parkinson’s disease, and suggested that future research should aim to discover subtypes that are robustly replicable across multiple datasets rather than focussing on one dataset at a time. Hopefully, through clinical applicable subtyping of Parkinson’s disease would lead to translation of these subtypes into research and clinical use.",

Aging of the female reproductive system occurs approximately 10 years prior to the natural age-associated functional decline of other organ systems. With an increase in life expectancy worldwide, reproductive aging has gradually become a key health issue among women. Therefore, an adequate understanding of the causes and molecular mechanisms of ovarian aging is essential towards the inhibition of age-related diseases and the promotion of health and longevity in women. In general, women begin to experience a decline in ovarian function around the age of 35 years, which is mainly manifested as a decrease in the number of ovarian follicles and the quality of oocytes. Studies have revealed the occurrence of mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced DNA repair, epigenetic changes, and metabolic alterations in the cells within the ovaries as age increases.

Here we review the historical origins and the current state of the science of innate and adaptive immunity in aging and longevity. From the modern point of view, innate and adaptive immunity are not only affected by aging but also are important parts of its underlying mechanisms. Excessive levels or activity of antimicrobial peptides, C-reactive protein, complement system, TLR/NF-κB, cGAS/STING/IFN 1,3 and AGEs/RAGE pathways, myeloid cells and NLRP3 inflammasome, declined levels of NK cells in innate immunity, thymus involution and decreased amount of naive T-cells in adaptive immunity, are biomarkers of aging and predisposition factors for cellular senescence and aging-related pathologies. Long-living species, human centenarians, and women are characterized by less inflamm-aging and decelerated immunosenescence. Despite recent progress in understanding, the harmonious theory of immunosenescence is still developing. Geroprotectors targeting these mechanisms are just emerging and are comprehensively discussed in this article.",

The diagnosis of PD is mainly clinical, but dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography can improve the accuracy of the diagnosis. Dopamine based therapies are used for the treatment of motor symptoms. Non-motor symptoms are treated with other medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (depression/anxiety), acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (dementia), and atypical antipsychotics (psychosis). Patients with motor fluctuations or uncontrolled tremor, benefit from deep brain stimulation. Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel is an alternative to deep brain stimulation for uncontrolled motor fluctuations. Rehabilitative therapies such as physical, occupational, and speech therapy are important during all stages of the disease. Management of PD is complex but there have been significant advancements in the treatment of motor and non-motor symptoms over the past few years. This review discusses the updates in the medical and surgical management of PD.",

Despite the advent of new AEDs, drug resistant-epilepsy continues to affect 30-40% of PWE. Once identified as having drug-resistant epilepsy, these patients should be referred to a comprehensive epilepsy center for evaluation to establish if they are candidates for potential curative surgeries. Unfortunately, a large proportion of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy are poor surgical candidates due to a seizure focus located in eloquent cortex, multifocal epilepsy or inability to identify the zone of ictal onset. An alternative treatment modality for these patients is neuromodulation. Here we present the evidence, indications and safety considerations for the neuromodulation therapies in vagal nerve stimulation (VNS), responsive neurostimulation (RNS), or deep brain stimulation (DBS).",

    "abstract": "Stroke can occur at any age or stage in life. Although it is commonly thought of as a disease amongst the elderly, it is important to highlight the fact that it also affects infants and children. In both populations, strokes have a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Arguably, it is more detrimental in the pediatric population given the occurrence at a younger age and therefore, a longer duration of disability, potentially over the entire lifespan. The high rate of morbidity and mortality in pediatrics is attributed to significant delays in diagnosis, as well as misdiagnosis. Acute stroke management is time dependent. Patients who receive acute treatment with either intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) or mechanical thrombectomy, have improved mortality and functional outcomes. Additionally, the earlier treatment is initiated, the higher the likelihood of preserving penumbra, restoring cerebral blood flow and potentially reversing symptoms, thereby limiting disability. Prompt identification is essential as it leads to improved patient care in such a narrow therapeutic window. It enhances the care received during hospitalization and reduces the risk of early stroke recurrence. Despite limited data and lack of large randomized clinical trials in pediatrics, both IV tPA and mechanical thrombectomy have been successfully used. Bridging the gap of acute stroke management in the pediatric population is an essential part of minimizing adverse outcomes. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology of pediatric stroke, the diverse etiologies, presentation as well as both acute and preventative management.",

    "abstract": "Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is defined as a syndrome of ischemic cardiomyopathy. Myogenesis and angiogenesis in the ischemic myocardium are important for cardiomyocyte (CM) survival, improving cardiac function and decreasing the progression of heart failure after IHD. Cellular senescence is a state of permanent irreversible cell cycle arrest caused by stress that results in a decline in cellular functions, such as proliferation, migration, homing, and differentiation. In addition, senescent cells produce the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which affects the tissue microenvironment and surrounding cells by secreting proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix degradation proteins. The accumulation of cardiovascular-related senescent cells, including vascular endothelial cells (VECs), vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), CMs and progenitor cells, is an important risk factor of cardiovascular diseases, such as vascular aging, atherosclerotic plaque formation, myocardial infarction (MI) and ventricular remodeling. This review summarizes the processes of angiogenesis, myogenesis and cellular senescence after IHD. In addition, this review focuses on the relationship between cellular senescence and cardiovascular disease and the mechanism of cellular senescence. Finally, we discuss a potential therapeutic strategy for MI targeting senescent cells.",

    "abstract": "The clinical relevance of IL-1β in chronic inflammation underlying atherosclerosis has been reinforced by recent evidence associating pharmacological inhibition of the cytokine with lower cardiovascular risk. Previously, we have demonstrated a direct involvement of IL-1β in endothelial senescence. Therefore, this can be a key mechanism contributing to the sterile inflammatory milieu associated with aging, termed inflammaging. In the present study, we have evaluated whether a positive feedback of IL-1β in the NLRP3 inflammasome via NF-κB could promote human endothelial senescence in vitro and murine endothelial dysfunction in vivo. Our results indicate that the NLRP3 inflammasome is pivotal in mediating the detrimental effects of IL-1β, showing that auto-activation is a crucial feature boosting endothelial cell senescence in vitro, which is paralleled by vascular dysfunction in vivo. Hence, the inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly, MCC 950, was able to disrupt the aforementioned positive loop, thus alleviating inflammation, cell senescence and vascular dysfunction. Besides, we explored alternative NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitory agents such as the RAS heptapeptide Ang-(1-7) and the anti-aging protein klotho, both of which demonstrated protective effects in vitro and in vivo. Altogether, our results highlight a fundamental role for the hereby described NLRP3 inflammasome/IL-1β positive feedback loop in stress-induced inflammaging and the associated vascular dysfunction, additionally providing evidence of a potential therapeutic use of MCC 950, Ang-(1-7) and recombinant klotho to block this loop and its deleterious effects.",

Alterations in brain metabolism have been observed in obesity and diabetes models induced by exposure to diets rich in saturated fat and/or sugar and have been linked to memory impairment. However, it remains to be determined whether brain dysfunction induced by obesogenic diets results from permanent brain alterations. We tested the hypothesis that an obesogenic diet (high-fat and high-sucrose diet; HFHSD) causes reversible changes in hippocampus and cortex metabolism and alterations in behavior. Mice were exposed to HFHSD for 24 weeks or for 16 weeks followed by 8 weeks of diet normalization. Development of the metabolic syndrome, changes in behavior, and brain metabolite profiles by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) were assessed longitudinally. Control mice were fed an ingredient-matched low-fat and low-sugar diet. Mice fed the HFHSD developed obesity, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, with a more severe phenotype in male than female mice. Relative to controls, both male and female HFHSD-fed mice showed increased anxiety-like behavior, impaired memory in object recognition tasks, but preserved working spatial memory as evaluated by spontaneous alternation in a Y-maze. Alterations in the metabolite profiles were observed both in the hippocampus and cortex but were more distinct in the hippocampus. HFHSD-induced metabolic changes included altered levels of lactate, glutamate, GABA, glutathione, taurine, N-acetylaspartate, total creatine and total choline. Notably, HFHSD-induced metabolic syndrome, anxiety, memory impairment, and brain metabolic alterations recovered upon diet normalization for 8 weeks. In conclusion, cortical and hippocampal derangements induced by long-term HFHSD consumption are reversible rather than being the result of permanent tissue damage.",

Therefore, the identification of novel drugs for the effective management of CNS diseases is very urgent. Puerarin, a highly bioactive ingredient isolated from Pueraria lobata, is known to possess a broad spectrum of pharmacological properties including anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, anti-antioxidant, neuroprotective, and cardioprotective features. However, its clinical application is limited due to its poor water solubility.

During the process of senescence, the human body suffers from a series of imbalances, which have been shown to further accelerate aging, trigger tumorigenesis, and facilitate cancer progression. Therefore, exploring the junctions of aging and cancer and searching for novel methods to restore the junctions is of great importance to intervene against aging-related cancers. In this review, we have identified the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms of aging-related cancers by comparing alterations in the human body caused by aging and the factors that trigger cancers. We found that the common mechanisms of aging and cancer include cellular senescence, alterations in proteostasis, microbiota disorders (decreased probiotics and increased pernicious bacteria), persistent chronic inflammation, extensive immunosenescence, inordinate energy metabolism, altered material metabolism, endocrine disorders, altered genetic expression, and epigenetic modification. Furthermore, we have proposed that aging and cancer have common means of intervention, including novel uses of common medicine (metformin, resveratrol, and rapamycin), dietary restriction, and artificial microbiota intervention or selectively replenishing scarce metabolites. In addition, we have summarized the research progress of each intervention and revealed their bidirectional effects on cancer progression to compare their reliability and feasibility. Therefore, the study findings provide vital information for advanced research studies on age-related cancers. However, there is a need for further optimization of the described methods and more suitable methods for complicated clinical practices.

    "abstract": "Malonylation is a recently identified post-translational modification with malonyl-coenzyme A as the donor. It conserved both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Recent advances in the identification and quantification of lysine malonylation by bioinformatic analysis have improved our understanding of its role in the regulation of protein activity, interaction, and localization and have elucidated its involvement in many biological processes. Malonylation has been linked to diverse physiological processes, including metabolic disorders, inflammation, and immune regulation. This review discusses malonylation in theory, describes the underlying mechanism, and summarizes the recent progress in malonylation research. The latest findings point to novel functions of malonylation and highlight the mechanisms by which malonylation regulates a variety of cellular processes. Our review also marks the association between lysine malonylation, the enzymes involved, and various diseases, and discusses promising diagnostic and therapeutic biomolecular targets for future clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Articular cartilage function depends on the temporal and zonal distribution of coordinated metabolic regulation in chondrocytes. Emerging evidence shows the importance of cellular metabolism in the molecular control of the cartilage and its dysregulation in degenerative diseases like osteoarthritis (OA). Compared to most other tissues, chondrocytes are sparsely located in the extracellular matrix, lacking the typical proximity of neural, vascular, and lymphatic tissue. Making up under 5% of the total tissue weight of cartilage, chondrocytes have a relative deficiency of access to nutrients and oxygen, as well as limited pathways for metabolite removal. This makes cartilage a unique tissue with hypocellularity, prolonged metabolic rate, and tissue turnover. Studies in the past decade have shown that several pathways of central carbon metabolism are essential for cartilage homeostasis. Here, we summarised the literature findings on the role of cellular metabolism in determining the chondrocyte function and how this metabolic dysregulation led to cartilage aging in OA and provided an outlook on how the field may evolve in the coming years. Although the various energy metabolism pathways are inextricably linked with one another, for the purpose of this review, we initially endeavoured to examine them individually and in relative isolation. Subsequently, we comment on what is known regarding the integration and linked signalling pathways between these systems and the therapeutic opportunities for targeting OA metabolism.",

The main pathological hallmarks of ANDs include behavioral changes, excessive oxidative stress, progressive functional declines, impaired mitochondrial function, protein misfolding, neuroinflammation, and neuronal cell death. Recently, efforts have been made to overcome ANDs because of their increased age-dependent prevalence. Black pepper, the fruit of Piper nigrum L. in the family Piperaceae, is an important food spice that has long been used in traditional medicine to treat various human diseases. Consumption of black pepper and black pepper-enriched products is associated with numerous health benefits due to its antioxidant, antidiabetic, anti-obesity, antihypertensive, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, hepatoprotective, and neuroprotective properties. This review shows that black pepper's major bioactive neuroprotective compounds, such as piperine, effectively prevent AND symptoms and pathological conditions by modulating cell survival signaling and death. Relevant molecular mechanisms are also discussed. In addition, we highlight how recently developed novel nanodelivery systems are vital for improving the efficacy, solubility, bioavailability, and neuroprotective properties of black pepper (and thus piperine) in different experimental AND models, including clinical trials. This extensive review shows that black pepper and its active ingredients have therapeutic potential for ANDs.",

    "abstract": "Sick, male, and older populations are more vulnerable to COVID-19. However, it remains unclear whether a common mechanism exists across different demographic characteristics. SARS-CoV-2 infection is initiated by the specific binding of the viral spike protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This study analyzed the demographics of pulmonary ACE2 expression, Mendelian randomization (MR) of ACE2 and COVID-19, and comparative tropism of SARS-CoV-2. The key features of SARS-CoV-2 tropism, including pulmonary ACE2 expression and ACE2-expressing cell types, showed distinct subphenotypes associated with the demographics of vulnerable COVID-19 populations, suggesting a hypothesis centered on \"ACE2\" to explain their interplay. Next, by integrating multiple COVID-19 cohorts of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) of ACE2, MR analysis demonstrated that ACE2 played a causal role in COVID-19 susceptibility and severity, suggesting ACE2 as a promising target for early COVID-19 treatment. Next, by analyzing the expression of host cell receptors using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of human lung tissues, comparative tropism analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses, but not non-respiratory viruses, had remarkably overlapping and enriched cellular tropism in alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells. This finding indicates the possibility of coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses, perhaps implying sociovirology at the cellular level. Moreover, the binding of viral entry proteins to the compatible host cell receptors is under strong natural selection pressure. Therefore, comparative tropism might reveal the footprint of natural selection that shapes the virus population, which provides a novel perspective for understanding zoonotic spillover events.",

The human lifespan has significantly increased as a result of scientific and technological advancements. According to estimates, the world's elderly population will increase by 20% by 2050. Aging and age-related changes are discussed in this review in relation to the development of OA. We specifically discussed the cellular and molecular changes that occur in the chondrocytes during aging and how these changes may make synovial joints more susceptible to OA development. These changes include chondrocyte senescence, mitochondrial dysfunction, epigenetic modifications, and decreased growth factor response. The age-associated changes occur not only in the chondrocytes but also in the matrix, subchondral bone, and synovium. This review aims to provide an overview of the interplay between chondrocytes and matrix and how age-related changes affect the normal function of cartilage and contribute to OA development. Understanding the alterations that affect the function of chondrocytes will emerge new possibilities for prospective therapeutic options for the treatment of OA.",

Although mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (MSC-Exos) promise therapeutic benefits for injury repair, there has been no evaluation of the impact of MSC-Exos administration on FN repair. Herein, we explore the function of MSC-Exos in the immunomodulation of macrophages and their effects in repairing FN injury. An ultracentrifugation technique was used to separate exosomes from the MSC supernatant. Administrating MSC-Exos to SD rats via local injection after FN injury promoted axon regeneration and myelination and alleviated local and systemic inflammation. MSC-Exos facilitated M2 polarization and reduced the M1-M2 polarization ratio. miRNA sequencing of MSC-Exos and previous literature showed that the MAPK/NF-κb pathway was a downstream target of macrophage polarization. We confirmed this hypothesis both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. Our findings show that MSC-Exos are a potential candidate for treating FN injury because they may have superior benefits for FN injury recovery and can decrease inflammation by controlling the heterogeneity of macrophages, which is regulated by the p38 MAPK/NF-κb pathway.",

    "abstract": "Protecting the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is crucial for maintaining brain homeostasis after ischemic stroke. Previous studies showed that M2 microglial extracellular vesicles (EVs) played a neuroprotective role in cerebral ischemia. However, the role of M2 microglial EVs in maintaining BBB integrity is unclear. Therefore, we explored the mechanisms of M2 microglial EVs in regulating BBB integrity. To identify microglial EVs, we used nanoparticle tracking analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and western blot analysis. Adult male ICR mice were subjected to 90-min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), followed by the injection of PKH26-labeled M2 microglial EVs via the tail vein. After MCAO, we assessed brain infarct and edema volume, as well as modified neurological severity score. BBB integrity was measured by assessing IgG leakage. The effects of M2 microglial EVs on astrocytes and endothelial cells were also examined. To investigate the molecular mechanisms, we performed RNA sequencing, miR-23a-5p knockdown, and luciferase reporter assays. Our results showed that PKH26-labeled microglial EVs were mainly taken up by neurons and glial cells. M2 microglial EVs treatment decreased brain infarct and edema volume, modified neurological severity score, and IgG leakage, while increasing the ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5 expression after MCAO. Knockdown of miR-23a-5p reversed these effects. RNA sequencing revealed that the TNF, MMP3 and NFκB signaling pathway involved in regulating BBB integrity. Luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-23a-5p could bind to the 3' UTR of TNF. M2 microglial EVs-derived miR-23a-5p decreased TNF, MMP3 and NFκB p65 expression in astrocytes after oxygen-glucose deprivation, thereby increasing ZO-1 and Claudin-5 expression in bEnd.3 cells. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that M2 microglial EVs attenuated BBB disruption after cerebral ischemia by delivering miR-23a-5p, which targeted TNF and regulated MMP3 and NFκB p65 expression.",

Glial cells, including microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs)/oligodendrocytes (OLs) play critical roles in BBB damage and protection. Recent evidence indicates that immune cells also have an important role in BBB damage, vasogenic edema and HT. Therefore, regulating the crosstalk between glial cells and immune cells would hold the promise to alleviate AIS-induced BBB damage. In this review, we first introduce the roles of glia cells, pericytes, and crosstalk between glial cells in the damage and protection of BBB after AIS, emphasizing the polarization, inflammatory response and crosstalk between microglia, astrocytes, and other glia cells. We then describe the role of glial cell-derived exosomes in the damage and protection of BBB after AIS. Next, we specifically discuss the crosstalk between glial cells and immune cells after AIS. Finally, we propose that glial cells could be a potential target for alleviating BBB damage after AIS and we discuss some molecular targets and potential strategies to alleviate BBB damage by regulating glial cells after AIS.",

Biological age estimates may be derived using mathematical modelling with biomarkers set as predictors and chronological age as the output. The difference between biological and chronological age is denoted the \"age gap\" and considered a complementary indicator of aging. The utility of the \"age gap\" metric is assessed through examination of its associations with exposures of interest and the demonstration of additional information provided by this metric over chronological age alone. This paper reviews the key concepts of biological age estimation, the age gap metric, and approaches to assessment of model performance in this context. We further discuss specific challenges for the field, in particular the limited generalisability of effect sizes across studies owing to dependency of the age gap metric on pre-processing and model building methods. The discussion will be centred on brain age estimation, but the concepts are transferable to all biological age estimation.",

Here, we systematically summarize the molecular mechanisms and function of TFEB regulation. We then discuss the roles of TFEB and autophagy-lysosome pathways in major neurodegenerative diseases including AD and PD. Finally, we illustrate small molecule TFEB activators with protective roles in NDs animal models, which show great potential for being further developed into novel anti-neurodegenerative agents.

This study sought to investigate IC impairment trajectories across domains and their associations with the risk of age-related outcomes, including falls, functional limitations, reduced quality of life (QoL) and mortality at 4- and 8-year follow-ups. The study sample comprised 1,782 older adults residing in the community from the Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TLSA). Utilizing group-based multitrajectory modeling, distinct subtypes of IC decline trajectories across various domains were identified. Cox proportional hazard models and multivariable logistic regression analyses were employed to assess the associations between the identified subtypes and age-related outcomes. We identified four subtypes of IC decline: robust with mild decline (n=902), hearing loss with cognitive decline (n=197), physio-cognitive decline (PCD) with depression (n=373), and severe IC decline (n=310). Over the 4-year study period, compared to the robust with mild decline group, hearing loss with cognitive decline group exhibited a significantly higher risk of diminished QoL (OR=2.53 [1.66-3.86], p<0.01), whereas those in the PCD with depression group experienced an elevated risk of falls (OR=1.62 [1.18-2.23], p<0.01), as well as functional limitation (OR=2.61 [1.81-3.75], p<.01). Individuals in the severe IC decline group faced a substantially increased risk of all outcomes of interest. Distinct subtypes of IC decline across different domains have varying impacts on age-related outcomes, highlighting the need for a personalized approach to promote healthy ageing at the population level, while further investigation into specific pathophysiological mechanisms is warranted as well.",

    "abstract": "FUS and TDP-43, two RNA-binding proteins from the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein family, have gained significant attention in the field of neurodegenerative diseases due to their association with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal degeneration (FTD). They possess folded domains for binding ATP and various nucleic acids including DNA and RNA, as well as substantial intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) including prion-like domains (PLDs) and RG-/RGG-rich regions. They play vital roles in various cellular processes, including transcription, splicing, microRNA maturation, RNA stability and transport and DNA repair. In particular, they are key components for forming ribonucleoprotein granules and stress granules (SGs) through homotypic or heterotypic liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Strikingly, liquid-like droplets formed by FUS and TDP-43 may undergo aging to transform into less dynamic assemblies such as hydrogels, inclusions, and amyloid fibrils, which are the pathological hallmarks of ALS and FTD. This review aims to synthesize and consolidate the biophysical knowledge of the sequences, structures, stability, dynamics, and inter-domain interactions of FUS and TDP-43 domains, so as to shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying their liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and amyloidosis. The review further delves into the mechanisms through which ALS-causing mutants of the well-folded hPFN1 disrupt the dynamics of LLPS of FUS prion-like domain, providing key insights into a potential mechanism for misfolding/aggregation-prone proteins to cause neurodegenerative diseases and aging by gain of functions. With better understanding of different biophysical aspects of FUS and TDP-43, the ultimate goal is to develop drugs targeting LLPS and amyloidosis, which could mediate protein homeostasis within cells and lead to new treatments for currently intractable diseases, particularly neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS, FTD and aging. However, the study of membrane-less organelles and condensates is still in its infancy and therefore the review also highlights key questions that require future investigation.",

    "abstract": "With aging, the incidence of age-related diseases increases. Hence, age-related diseases are inevitable. However, the mechanisms by which aging leads to the onset and progression of age-related diseases remain unclear. It has been reported that inflammation is closely associated with age-related diseases and that the cGAS-STING signaling pathway, which can sense the aberrant presence of cytosolic DNA during aging and induce an inflammatory response, is an important mediator of inflammation in age-related diseases. With a better understanding of the structure and molecular biology of the cGAS-STING signaling axis, numerous selective inhibitors and agonists targeting the cGAS-STING pathway in human age-related diseases have been developed to modulate inflammatory responses. Here, we provide a narrative review of the activity of the cGAS-STING pathway in age-related diseases and discuss its general mechanisms in the onset and progression of age-related diseases. In addition, we outline treatments targeting the cGAS-STING pathway, which may constitute a potential therapeutic alternative for age-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, but its clinical benefit is limited in advanced gastric cancer (GC). Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have been reported to be associated with ICB resistance, but the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Our previous single-cell RNA-seq analysis of GC revealed that POSTN+FAP+ extracellular matrix CAFs (eCAFs) communicate with macrophages. Here, we evaluated the correlation between eCAFs and ICB response in TCGA-STAD and real-world cohorts. Immune infiltration analysis and correlation analysis were performed to assess the relationship between eCAFs and macrophages. We first confirmed a negative correlation between the abundance of eCAFs and the overall response rate (ORR) to anti-PD-1 treatment in TCGA-STAD and real-world GC cohorts. Overexpression of POSTN in CAFs enhanced macrophage chemotaxis, while POSTN interference showed the opposite effect in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the cell density of POSTN+ CAFs was positively correlated with the infiltration level of CD163+ macrophages in GC patient tissues. The results demonstrated that POSTN secreted by CAFs enhances macrophage chemotaxis by activating the Akt signaling pathway in macrophages. Additionally, we found that POSTN+FAP+ eCAFs may exist in multiple solid tumors and are associated with ICB resistance. eCAFs promote macrophage chemotaxis through the secretion of POSTN, thereby leading to ICB resistance. High expression of POSTN is likely to predict a poor response to ICB. POSTN downregulation may be considered as a candidate therapeutic strategy to improve ICB efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence is an irreversible and multifaceted process inducing tissue dysfunction and organismal aging, and thus the clearance of senescent cells can prevent or delay the onset of aging-related pathologies. Herein, we developed an augmented photothermal therapy strategy integrated with an antibody against β2-microglobulin (aB2MG) and an immune adjuvant imiquimod (R837) to effectively accelerate senescent cell apoptosis and clearance under a near-infrared light. With this strategy, the designed CroR@aB2MG enables the targeting of senescent cells and the application of photothermal therapy concomitantly, the initiation of immune clearance subsequently, and finally the realization of protective effects against senescence. Our results showed that the photo-induced heating effect caused senescent cells to quickly undergo apoptosis and the synchronous immune response accelerated the clearance of senescent cells in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, this photoactivated speedy clearing strategy may provide an efficient way for the treatment of senescence-related diseases by eliminating senescent cells with biomaterials.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (ND) are conditions defined by progressive deterioration of the structure and function of the nervous system. Some major examples include Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These diseases lead to various dysfunctions, like impaired cognition, memory, and movement. Chronic neuroinflammation may underlie numerous neurodegenerative disorders. Microglia, an important immunocell in the brain, plays a vital role in defending against neuroinflammation. When exposed to different stimuli, microglia are activated and assume different phenotypes, participating in immune regulation of the nervous system and maintaining tissue homeostasis. The immunological activity of activated microglia is affected by glucose metabolic alterations. However, in the context of chronic neuroinflammation, specific alterations of microglial glucose metabolism and their mechanisms of action remain unclear. Thus, in this paper, we review the glycometabolic reprogramming of microglia in ND. The key molecular targets and main metabolic pathways are the focus of this research. Additionally, this study explores the mechanisms underlying microglial glucose metabolism reprogramming in ND and offers an analysis of the most recent therapeutic advancements. The ultimate aim is to provide insights into the development of potential treatments for ND.",

As people age, the microenvironment within skeleton favors bone resorption and inhibits bone formation, accompanied by bone marrow fat accumulation and multiple cellular senescence. Specifically, skeletal stem/stromal cells (SSCs) during aging tend to undergo adipogenesis rather than osteogenesis. Meanwhile, osteoblasts, as well as osteocytes, showed increased apoptosis, decreased quantity, and multiple functional limitations including impaired mechanical sensing, intercellular modulation, and exosome secretion. Also, the bone resorption function of macrophage-lineage cells (including osteoclasts and preosteoclasts) was significantly enhanced, as well as impaired vascularization and innervation. In this study, we systematically reviewed the effect of aging on bone and the within microenvironment (including skeletal cells as well as their intracellular structure variations, vascular structures, innervation, marrow fat distribution, and lymphatic system) caused by aging, and mechanisms of osteoimmune regulation of the bone environment in the aging state, and the causal relationship with multiple musculoskeletal diseases in addition with their potential therapeutic strategy.",

    "abstract": "Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is a lethal subtype of prostate cancer. It is characterized by the loss of androgen receptor (AR) signaling in neuroendocrine transdifferentiation, and finally, resistance to AR-targeted therapy. With the application of a new generation of potent AR inhibitors, the incidence of NEPC is gradually increasing. The molecular mechanism of neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) after androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) remains largely unclear. In this study, using NEPC-related genome sequencing database analyses, we screened RACGAP1, a common differentially expressed gene. We investigated RACGAP1 expression in clinical prostate cancer specimens by IHC. Regulated pathways were examined by Western blotting, qRT-PCR, luciferase reporter, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and immunoprecipitation assays. The corresponding function of RACGAP1 in prostate cancer was analyzed by CCK-8 and Transwell assays. The changes of neuroendocrine markers and AR expression in C4-2-R and C4-2B-R cells were detected in vitro. We confirmed that RACGAP1 contributed to NE transdifferentiation of prostate cancer. Patients with high tumor RACGAP1 expression had shorter relapse-free survival time. The expression of RACGAP1 was induced by E2F1. RACGAP1 promoted neuroendocrine transdifferentiation of prostate cancer by stabilizing EZH2 expression in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Moreover, overexpression of RACGAP1 promoted enzalutamide resistance of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells. Our results showed that the upregulation of RACGAP1 by E2F1 increased EZH2 expression, which drove NEPC progression. This study explored the molecular mechanism of NED and may provide novel methods and ideas for targeted therapy of NEPC.",

Extracellular vesicles serve as an important mediator in intercellular communication. In this study, we aimed to explore whether exercise-induced extracellular vesicles (EVs) of skeletal muscle origins contribute to exercise-related protective effects on metabolism. We found that the twelve weeks of swimming training improved glucose tolerance, reduced visceral lipid accumulation, alleviated liver damage, and inhibited atherosclerosis progression in both obese WT mice and ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice, which could be partially blocked by EV biogenesis repression. Injection of skeletal muscle-derived EVs from exercised C57BL/6J mice (twice a week for 12 weeks) had similar protective effects on both obese WT mice and ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice as exercise itself. Mechanistically, these exe-EVs could be endocytosed by major metabolic organs, especially the liver and adipose tissue. With the protein cargos rich in mitochondrial and fatty acid oxidation-related components, exe-EVs remodeled metabolism towards beneficial cardiovascular outcomes. Our study here has shown that exercise remodels metabolism towards beneficial cardiovascular outcomes at least partially via the skeletal muscle secreted EVs. Therapeutic delivery of exe-EVs or the analogues could be promising for prevention of certain cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.",

    "abstract": "The classification of microglial M1/M2 polarization in the acute phase of ischemic stroke remains controversial, which has limited further advances in neuroprotective strategy. To thoroughly assess the microglial phenotypes, we made the middle cerebral artery occlusion model in mice to simulate the acute pathological processes of ischemic stroke from normal conditions to acute cerebral ischemia and then to the early reperfusion period. The temporal changes in gene profiles, cell subtypes, and microglial function were comprehensively analyzed using single-cell RNA sequencing. We identified 37,614 microglial cells and divided them into eight distinct subpopulations. Mic_home, Mic_pre1, and Mic_pre2 subpopulations were three clusters mainly composed of cells from the control samples, in which Mic_home was a homeostatic subpopulation characterized by high expression of Hpgd and Tagap, and Mic_pre1 and Mic_pre2 were two clusters with preliminary inflammatory activation characteristics marked by P2ry13 and Wsb1 respectively. Mic_M1L1 and Mic_M1L2 subpopulations exhibited M1-like polarization manifested by the upregulation of inflammatory genes after ischemic stroke, while the intrinsic heterogeneity on the level of inflammatory responses and neurotrophic support properties was observed. Moreover, we identified three unique clusters of cells with low inflammation levels. Mic_np1, Mic_np2, and Mic_np3 were characterized by high expression of Arhgap45, Rgs10, and Pkm respectively. However, these cells did not show significant M2-like characteristics and their classic microglia function was also attenuated. These subpopulations exhibited higher activation of neuropeptide functional pathways. At last, we performed cell‒cell communication analysis and identified major couplings contributing to the interaction between microglia and other cell populations. In summary, our study elucidated the temporal heterogeneity of microglia in the acute phase of ischemic stroke, which may facilitate the identification of effective neuroprotective targets to curb ischemic damage at an early stage.",

We assessed the association of obesity, MRI-determined abdominal adipose tissue volumes, and insulin resistance with PET-determined amyloid and tau uptake in default mode network areas, and MRI-determined brain volume and cortical thickness in AD cortical signature in the cognitively normal midlife population. Thirty-two middle-aged (age: 51.27±6.12 years, 15 males, body mass index (BMI): 32.28±6.39 kg/m2) cognitively normal participants, underwent bloodwork, brain and abdominal MRI, and amyloid and tau PET scan.

FreeSurfer was used to automatically segment brain regions using a probabilistic atlas. PET scans were acquired using [11C]PiB and AV-1451 tracers and were analyzed using PET unified pipeline. The association of brain volumes, cortical thicknesses, and PiB and AV-1451 standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) with BMI, VAT/SAT ratio, and insulin resistance were assessed using Spearman's partial correlation. VAT/SAT ratio was associated significantly with PiB SUVRs in the right precuneus cortex (p=0.034) overall, controlling for sex. This association was significant only in males (p=0.044), not females (p=0.166). Higher VAT/SAT ratio and PiB SUVRs in the right precuneus cortex were associated with lower cortical thickness in AD-signature areas predominantly including bilateral temporal cortices, parahippocampal, medial orbitofrontal, and cingulate cortices, with age and sex as covariates. Also, higher BMI and insulin resistance were associated with lower cortical thickness in bilateral temporal poles. In midlife cognitively normal adults, we demonstrated higher amyloid pathology in the right precuneus cortex in individuals with a higher VAT/SAT ratio, a marker of visceral obesity, along with a lower cortical thickness in AD-signature areas associated with higher visceral obesity, insulin resistance, and amyloid pathology.",

Nevertheless, the process is still not fully understood. It has been proven, for example, that autophagy can be a positive force for maintaining good health by removing older or damaged cells. By contrast, autophagy is also involved in the onset and progression of various conditions caused by pathogenic infections. These diseases generally involve several important organs in the human body, including the liver, kidney, heart, and central nervous system. The regulation of the defects of autophagy defects may potentially be used to treat some diseases.

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation, characterized by the secretion of abundant inflammatory mediators, pro-inflammatory polarization of microglia, and the recruitment of infiltrating myeloid cells to foci of inflammation, drives or exacerbates the pathological processes of central nervous system disorders, especially in neurodegenerative diseases. Autophagy plays an essential role in neuroinflammatory processes, and the underlaying physiological mechanisms are closely correlated with neuroinflammation-related signals. Inhibition of mTOR and activation of AMPK and FOXO1 enhance autophagy and thereby suppress NLRP3 inflammasome activity and apoptosis, leading to the relief of neuroinflammatory response. And autophagy mitigates neuroinflammation mainly manifested by promoting the polarization of microglia from a pro-inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory state, reducing the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, and up-regulating the levels of anti-inflammatory factors. Notably, epigenetic modifications are intimately associated with autophagy and the onset and progression of various brain diseases. Non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs, circular RNAs and long noncoding RNAs, and histone acetylation have been reported to adjust autophagy-related gene and protein expression to alleviate inflammation in neurological diseases. The present review primarily focuses on the role and mechanisms of autophagy in neuroinflammatory responses, as well as epigenetic modifications of autophagy in neuroinflammation to reveal potential therapeutic targets in central nervous system diseases.",

    "abstract": "Decades of research have demonstrated an incontrovertible role of amyloid-β (Aβ) in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the overemphasis on the pathological impacts of Aβ may obscure the role of its metabolic precursor, amyloid precursor protein (APP), as a significant hub in the occurrence and progression of AD. The complicated enzymatic processing, ubiquitous receptor-like properties, and abundant expression of APP in the brain, as well as its close links with systemic metabolism, mitochondrial function and neuroinflammation, imply that APP plays multifaceted roles in AD. In this review, we briefly describe the evolutionarily conserved biological characteristics of APP, including its structure, functions and enzymatic processing. We also discuss the possible involvement of APP and its enzymatic metabolites in AD, both detrimental and beneficial. Finally, we describe pharmacological agents or genetic approaches with the capability to reduce APP expression or inhibit its cellular internalization, which can ameliorate multiple aspects of AD pathologies and halt disease progression. These approaches provide a basis for further drug development to combat this terrible disease.",

    "abstract": "Although researched extensively the understanding regarding mechanisms underlying glaucoma pathogenesis remains limited. Further, the exact mechanism behind neuronal death remains elusive. The role of neuroinflammation in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death has been prominently theorised. This review provides a comprehensive summary of neuroinflammatory responses in glaucoma. A systematic search of Medline and Embase for articles published up to 8th March 2023 yielded 32 studies using post-mortem tissues from glaucoma patients. The raw data were extracted from tables and text to calculate the standardized mean differences (SMDs). These studies utilized post-mortem tissues from glaucoma patients, totalling 490 samples, compared with 380 control samples. Among the included studies, 27 reported glial cell activation based on changes to cellular morphology and molecular staining. Molecular changes were predominantly attributed to astrocytes (62.5%) and microglia (15.6%), with some involvement of Muller cells. These glial cell changes included amoeboid microglial cells with increased CD45 or HLA-DR intensity and hypertrophied astrocytes with increased glial fibrillary acidic protein labelling. Further, changes to extracellular matrix proteins like collagen, galectin, and tenascin-C suggested glial cells' influence on structural changes in the optic nerve head. The activation of DAMPs-driven immune response and the classical complement cascade was reported and found to be associated with activated glial cells in glaucomatous tissue. Increased pro-inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) were also linked to glial cells. Glial cell activation was also associated with mitochondrial, vascular, metabolic and antioxidant component disruptions. Association of the activated glial cells with pro-inflammatory responses, dysregulation of homeostatic components and antigen presentation indicates that glial cell responses influence glaucoma progression. However, the exact mechanism triggering these responses and underlying interactions remains unexplored. This necessitates further research using human samples for an increased understanding of the precise role of neuroinflammation in glaucoma progression.",

Interestingly, treatment with a G9a inhibitor (G9ai) in SAMP8 mice reversed the high levels of H3K9me2 and rescued cognitive decline. A transcriptional profile analysis after G9ai treatment revealed increased gene expression of glia maturation factor β (GMFB) in SAMP8 mice. Besides, a H3K9me2 ChIP-seq analysis after G9a inhibition treatment showed the enrichment of gene promoters associated with neural functions. We observed the induction of neuronal plasticity and a reduction of neuroinflammation after G9ai treatment, and more strikingly, these neuroprotective effects were reverted by the pharmacological inhibition of GMFB in mice and cell cultures; this was also validated by the RNAi approach generating the knockdown of <i>GMFB</i>/<i>Y507A.10</i> in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. Importantly, we present evidence that GMFB activity is controlled by G9a-mediated lysine methylation as well as we identified that G9a directly bound GMFB and catalyzed the methylation at lysine (K) 20 and K25 <i>in vitro</i>. Furthermore, we found that the neurodegenerative role of G9a as a GMFB suppressor would mainly rely on methylation of the K25 position of GMFB, and thus G9a pharmacological inhibition removes this methylation promoting neuroprotective effects. Then, our findings confirm an undescribed mechanism by which G9a inhibition acts at two levels, increasing GMFB and regulating its function to promote neuroprotective effects in age-related cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "The study explores the intricate relationship between aging and the development of noncommunicable diseases [NCDs], focusing on whether these diseases are inevitable consequences of aging or primarily driven by lifestyle factors. By examining epidemiological data, particularly from hunter-gatherer societies, the study highlights that many NCDs prevalent in modern populations are rare in these societies, suggesting a significant influence of lifestyle choices. It delves into the mechanisms through which poor diet, smoking, and other lifestyle factors contribute to systemic physiological imbalances, characterized by oxidative stress, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, and dysregulation of the sympathetic nervous system, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and the immune system. The interplay between this pattern and individual factors such as genetic susceptibility, biological variability, epigenetic changes and the microbiome is proposed to play a crucial role in the development of a range of age-related NCDs. Modified biomolecules such as oxysterols and advanced glycation end products also contribute to their development. Specific diseases such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, Parkinson's disease, glaucoma and osteoarthritis are analyzed to illustrate these mechanisms. The study concludes that while aging contributes to the risk of NCDs, lifestyle factors play a crucial role, offering potential avenues for prevention and intervention through healthier living practices. One possible approach could be to try to restore the physiological balance, e.g. through dietary measures [e.g. Mediterranean diet, Okinawan diet or Paleolithic diet] in conjunction with [a combination of] pharmacological interventions and other lifestyle changes.",

However, the mechanism of producing CSPGs by RAs and their roles in other aspects are often overlooked. In recent years, novel generation mechanisms and functions of CSPGs have gradually emerged. Extracellular traps (ETs), a new recently discovered phenomenon in SCI, can promote secondary injury. ETs are released by neutrophils and microglia, which activate astrocytes to produce CSPGs after SCI. CSPGs inhibit axon regeneration and play an important role in regulating inflammation as well as cell migration and differentiation; some of these regulations are beneficial. The current review summarized the process of ET-activated RAs to generate CSPGs at the cellular signaling pathway level. Moreover, the roles of CSPGs in inhibiting axon regeneration, regulating inflammation, and regulating cell migration and differentiation were discussed. Finally, based on the above process, novel potential therapeutic targets were proposed to eliminate the adverse effects of CSPGs.",

    "abstract": "Physical exercise may reduce dementia risk in aging, but varying reports on its effectiveness make it challenging to ascribe what level of exercise will have significant longer-term effects on important functions such as hippocampal-based learning and memory. This study compared the effect of three different 6-month exercise regimens on hippocampal-dependent cognition in healthy, elderly individuals. Participants, aged 65-85 with no cognitive deficits, were randomly assigned to one of three exercise interventions (low (LIT), medium (MIT), and High intensity interval training (HIIT), respectively). Each participant attended 72 supervised exercise sessions over a 6-month period. A total of 151 participants completed all sessions. Cognitive testing for hippocampal performance occurred monthly, as did blood collection, and continued for up to 5 years following initiation of the study. Multimodal 7 Tesla MRI scans were taken at commencement, 6 and 12 months. After 6 months, only the HIIT group displayed significant improvement in hippocampal function, as measured by paired associative learning (PAL). MRI from the HIIT group showed abrogation of the age-dependent volumetric decrease within several cortical regions including the hippocampus and improved functional connectivity between multiple neural networks not seen in the other groups. HIIT-mediated changes in the circulating levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and cortisol correlated to improved hippocampal-dependent cognitive ability. These findings demonstrate that HIIT significantly improves and prolongs the hippocampal-dependent cognitive health of aged individuals. Importantly, improvement was retained for at least 5 years following initiation of HIIT, suggesting that the changes seen in hippocampal volume and connectivity underpin this long-term maintenance. Sustained improvement in hippocampal function to this extent confirms that such exercise-based interventions can provide significant protection against hippocampal cognitive decline in the aged population. The changes in specific blood factor levels also may provide useful biomarkers for choosing the optimal exercise regimen to promote cognitive improvement.",

This review delves into the immune response mechanisms in RIRI, particularly emphasizing the roles played by resident and peripheral immune cells. It highlights the pivotal role of microglia, the primary resident immune cells, in exacerbating neuroinflammation and neuronal damage through their activation and subsequent release of pro-inflammatory mediators. Additionally, the review explores the contributions of other glial cell types, such as astrocytes and Müller cells, in modulating the immune response within the retinal environment. The dual role of the complement system in RIRI is also examined, revealing its complex functions in both safeguarding and impairing retinal health. Inflammasomes, triggered by various danger signals, are discussed as crucial contributors to the inflammatory pathways in RIRI, with an emphasis on the involvement of different NOD-like receptor family proteins. The review further analyzes the infiltration and impact of peripheral immune cells like neutrophils, macrophages, and T cells, which migrate to the retina following ischemic injury. Critical to this discussion is the interplay between resident and peripheral immune cells and its implications for RIRI pathophysiology. Finally, the review outlines future research directions, focusing on basic research and the potential for clinical translation to enhance understanding and treatment of RIRI.",

    "abstract": "Increased entropy is a common cause of disease and aging. Lifespan entropy is the overall increase in disorder caused by a person over their lifetime. Aging leads to the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which damage the antioxidant system and disrupt redox balance. Organ aging causes chronic inflammation, disrupting the balance of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors. Inflammaging, which is a chronic low-grade inflammatory state, is activated by oxidative stress and can lead to immune system senescence. During this process, entropy increases significantly as the body transitions from a state of low order to high disorder. However, the connection among inflammation, aging, and immune system activity is still not fully understood. This review introduces the idea of the ROS-inflammation-immune balance for the first time and suggests that this balance may be connected to aging and the development of age-related diseases. We also explored how the balance of these three factors controls and affects age-related diseases. Moreover, imbalance in the relationship described above disrupts the regular structures of cells and alters their functions, leading to cellular damage and the emergence of a disorganized state marked by increased entropy. Maintaining a low entropy state is crucial for preventing and reversing aging processes. Consequently, we examined the current preclinical evidence for antiaging medications that target this balance. Ultimately, comprehending the intricate relationships between these three factors and the risk of age-related diseases in organisms will aid in the development of clinical interventions that promote long-term health.",

    "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a metabolic disease characterized by low bone density resulting from abnormal bone metabolism, caused by impaired osteogenesis and/or excessive bone resorption. The coordinated differentiation of osteoblasts (originating from mesenchymal stem cells) and osteoclasts (derived from hematopoietic progenitor cells) is necessary for maintaining normal bone remodeling and homeostasis. Metabolites have been confirmed to regulate cellular behavior through post-translational modifications (PTMs), including acetylation, lactylation, and succinylation. During osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation, progenitor cells undergo metabolic rewiring to meet the energy demands of these biological processes. Consequently, local metabolite profiles and intermediate metabolic products dynamically change during bone remodeling, influencing cell differentiation via PTMs. Given the regulatory role of PTMs in bone metabolism, this review systematically examines PTMs involved in osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and explores potential avenues for addressing osteoporosis.",

Non-naturally occurring Blue Zones were excluded. A narrative synthesis of the evidence was carried out. Sixty-five records were included, identifying ten regions: Ogliastra (Sardinia, Italy), Ikaria (Greece), Cilento (Italy), one municipality in The Netherlands, Menorca (Spain), Okinawa (Japan), Rugao (China), Nicoya (Costa Rica), Martinique/Guadeloupe (French overseas regions in the Caribbean) and Loma Linda (California, United States). Longevity indicators revealed that Ogliastra, Okinawa and Nicoya exhibit higher longevity compared to national averages. Ikaria and Cilento show high life expectancy, the municipality in The Netherlands show a higher proportion of exceptional longevous population than other municipalities, whereas Guadeloupe/Martinique present a higher prevalence of supercentenarian deaths than metropolitan France. Data from Menorca remain inconclusive, and Rugao has fewer centenarians. No studies have been conducted in Loma Linda. Factors associated with longevity include diet, physical activity, climate, genetic factors and geographical isolation. The literature indicates that certain geographical areas demonstrated a higher percentage of centenarians than adjacent areas. While regions such as Okinawa, Ogliastra and Nicoya are well-characterized as Blue Zones, others remain under investigation, and some currently lack sufficient scientific evidence.",

    "abstract": "A significant body of work, accumulated over the years, strongly suggests that damage in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) contributes to aging in humans. Contradictory results, however, are reported in the literature, with some studies failing to provide support to this hypothesis. With the purpose of further understanding the aging process, several models, among which mouse models, have been frequently used. Although important affinities are recognized between humans and mice, differences on what concerns physiological properties, disease pathogenesis as well as life-history exist between the two; the extent to which such differences limit the translation, from mice to humans, of insights on the association between mtDNA damage and aging remains to be established. In this paper we revise the studies that analyze the association between patterns of mtDNA damage and aging, investigating putative alterations in mtDNA copy number as well as accumulation of deletions and of point mutations. Reports from the literature do not allow the establishment of a clear association between mtDNA copy number and age, either in humans or in mice. Further analysis, using a wide spectrum of tissues and a high number of individuals would be necessary to elucidate this pattern. Likewise humans, mice demonstrated a clear pattern of age-dependent and tissue-specific accumulation of mtDNA deletions. Deletions increase with age, and the highest amount of deletions has been observed in brain tissues both in humans and mice. On the other hand, mtDNA point mutations accumulation has been clearly associated with age in humans, but not in mice. Although further studies, using the same methodologies and targeting a larger number of samples would be mandatory to draw definitive conclusions, the revision of the available data raises concerns on the ability of mouse models to mimic the mtDNA damage patterns of humans, a fact with implications not only for the study of the aging process, but also for investigations of other processes in which mtDNA dysfunction is a hallmark, such as neurodegeneration.",

Because benefits of metformin extend beyond diabetes to other age-related pathology, and because its effect on gene expression profiles resembles that of caloric restriction, metformin has a potential as an anti-aging intervention and may soon be assessed as an intervention to extend healthspan. However, beneficial actions of metformin in the central nervous system have not been clearly established. The current study examined the effect of chronic oral metformin treatment on motor and cognitive function when initiated in young, middle-aged, or old male mice. C57BL/6 mice aged 4, 11, or 22 months were randomly assigned to either a metformin group (2 mg/ml in drinking water) or a control group. The mice were monitored weekly for body weight, as well as food and water intake and a battery of behavioral tests for motor, cognitive and visual function was initiated after the first month of treatment. Liver, hippocampus and cortex were collected at the end of the study to assess redox homeostasis. Overall, metformin supplementation in male mice failed to affect blood glucose, body weights and redox homeostasis at any age. It also had no beneficial effect on age-related declines in psychomotor, cognitive or sensory functions.

These data confirm that metformin treatment may be associated with deleterious effect resulting from the action of metformin on the central nervous system.",

    "abstract": "It is becoming increasingly clear that in order to accomplish healthy longevity for the population, there is an urgent need for the research and development of effective therapies against degenerative aging processes underlying major aging-related diseases, including heart disease, neurodegenerative diseases, type 2 diabetes, cancer, pulmonary obstructive diseases, as well as aging-related complications and susceptibilities of infectious communicable diseases. Yet, an important incentive for the research and development of such therapies appears to be the development of clinically applicable and scientifically grounded definitions and criteria for the multifactorial degenerative aging process (or \"senility\" using the existing ICD category), underlying those diseases, as well as for the safety and effectiveness of interventions against it. Such generally agreed definitions and criteria are currently absent. The devising of such criteria is important not only for the sake of their scientific value and their utility for the development of therapeutic solutions for the aging population, but also to comply with and implement major existing national and international programmatic and regulatory requirements. Some methodological suggestions and potential pitfalls for the development of such criteria are examined.",

Our previous study demonstrated that limb remote ischemic conditioning (LRIC) improved cerebral perfusion in intracranial arterial stenosis patients. The current study aimed to test whether LRIC promotes angiogenesis and increases phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (p-eNOS) activity in CCH rat model. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to three different groups: sham group, bilateral carotid artery occlusion (2VO) group and 2VO+LRIC group. Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) was measured with laser speckle contrast imager at 4 weeks. Cognitive testing was performed at four and six weeks after 2VO surgery. We demonstrated that LRIC treatment increased cerebral perfusion and improved the CCH induced spatial learning and memory impairment. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that LRIC prevented cell death in the CA1 region, and increased the number of vessels and angiogenesis in the hippocampus after 2VO. Western blot analysis shows that LRIC therapy significantly increased p-eNOS expression in the hippocampus when compared with 2VO rats. Moreover, eNOS inhibitor reduced the effect of LRIC on angiogenesis in the hippocampus and spatial learning and memory function. Our data suggested that LRIC promoted angiogenesis, which is mediated, in part, by eNOS/NO.",

PD is still an incurable disorder and the available medications are mainly directed to the treatment of symptoms in order to improve the quality of life. Oxidative injury has been identified as one of the principal factors involved in the progression of PD and several indications are now reported in the literature highlighting the prominent role of the superoxide radical in inducing neuronal toxicity. It follows that superoxide anions represent potential cellular targets for new drugs offering a novel therapeutic approach to cope with the progression of the disease. In this review we first present a comprehensive overview of the most common cellular reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, describing their cellular sources, their potential physiological roles in cell signalling pathways and the mechanisms through which they could contribute to the oxidative damage. We then analyse the potential therapeutic use of SOD-mimetic molecules, which can selectively remove superoxide radicals in a catalytic way, focusing on the classes of molecules that have therapeutically exploitable properties.",

Numerous pre-clinical studies have shown that estrogen, specifically 17-beta-estradiol (17β-E2), protects the brain from ischemic injury following stroke. There are multiple mechanisms of 17β-E2's neuroprotection, including activation of several neuroprotective pathways in the brain, but 17β-E2 also mediates the local and systemic immune response to ischemic stroke. This review summarizes the immune response to stroke, sex differences in stroke pathophysiology, and the role of estrogen as an immunomodulator. This review will focus almost entirely on the role of 17β-E2; however, there will be a brief review and comparison to other forms of estrogen. Understanding the immunomodulatory action of estrogens may provide an opportunity for the use of estrogens in treatment of stroke and other inflammatory disease.",

To address these issues, total 90 adult male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were used. The rats underwent 90<i>-</i>min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and the limb remote ischemic PerC was immediately applied after the onset of MCAO. We found that limb remote PerC protected BBB breakdown and brain edema, in parallel with reduced infarct volume and improved neurological deficits, after MCAO. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that MCAO resulted in disrupted continuity of claudin-5 staining in the cerebral endothelial cells with significant gap formation, which was significantly improved after PerC. Western blot analysis demonstrated that expression of tight junction (TJ) protein occludin was significantly increased, but other elements of TJ proteins, claudin-5 and ZO-1, in the BBB endothelial cells were not altered at 48 h after PerC, compared to MCAO group. The expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-9), which was involved in TJ protein degradation, was decreased after PerC. Interestingly, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (pERK1/2), an upstream of MMP-9 signaling, was significantly reduced in the PerC group. Our data suggest that PerC inhibits MMP-9-mediated occludin degradation, which could lead to decreased BBB disruption and brain edema after ischemic stroke.",

The underlying mechanism involves atherosclerosis of the arteries of the heart which is a relatively complex process comprising several steps. In CAD, atherosclerosis induces functional and structural changes. The pathogenesis of CAD results from various changes in and interactions between multiple cell types in the artery walls; these changes mainly include endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction, vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) alteration, lipid deposition and macrophage activation. Various blood markers associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular endpoints have been identified; however, few have yet been shown to have a diagnostic impact or important clinical implications that would affect patient management. Noncoding RNAs, especially microRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), can be stable in plasma and other body fluids and could therefore serve as biomarkers for some diseases. Many studies have shown that some miRNAs and lncRNAs play key roles in heart and vascular development and in cardiac pathophysiology. Thus, we summarize here the latest research progress, focusing on the molecular mechanism of miRNAs and lncRNAs in CAD, with the intent of seeking new targets for the treatment of heart disease.",

Chronic disease management is an important component in the care of the elderly. The effects of aging on different organ systems are also pertinent; such as the weakening homeostatic response to injury in the older individuals. Mucosal surfaces have the largest combined surface area in the body and are the site of important host microbe interactions, especially in the gut which is prone to injury, both from local and systemic insult. This susceptibility has been known to increase with age. Therefore it is important to understand the interplay between aging, injury and recovery at the mucosal surface. Sex hormones play an important role in the maintenance of the mucosal barrier function as well as the mucosa associated immune function in both genders. Menopause in women is a defined time period in which major hormonal changes occur such as a decline in systemic estradiol levels. The differential levels of sex hormones contribute to the sexual dimorphism seen in response to injury at the mucosal surface, prior to and following menopause. Thus the effect of sex hormone and aging on mucosal mechanisms in response to injury is an important area of investigation.",

For example, IL-33 plays a protective role in cardiovascular diseases. However, the role of IL-33 in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) remains unclear. This study aims to investigate whether IL-33 level in AIS patient serum can be used as a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker. The study included two hundred and six patients with first-ever ischemic stroke, who were admitted within 72 hours after stroke onset. The serum level of IL-33 was measured with ELISA and the severity of AIS patients on admission was evaluated based on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score. The functional outcome at 3 months was determined using the Barthel index (BI). We found that serum IL-33 was significantly higher (<i>P</i> < 0.001) in patients with AIS [57.68 ng/L (IQR, 44.95-76.73)] compared with healthy controls [47.48 ng/L (IQR, 38.67-53.78)]. IL-33 was an independent diagnostic biomarker for AIS with an OR of 1.051 (95%Cl, 1.018-1.085; P=0.002). Serum IL-33 was higher (<i>P</i> < 0.05) in the stroke patients with small cerebral infarction volume compared to AIS patients with large cerebral infarction. In addition, serum IL-33 was also significantly higher (<i>P</i> = 0.001) in the patients with mild stroke, compared to the patients with severe stroke. Furthermore, serum IL-33 level in AIS patients with a worse outcome was higher (<i>P</i> < 0.001) compared to AIS patients with a better outcome. IL-33 was also an independent predictor for the functional outcome with an adjusted OR of 0.932 (95% CI, 0.882-0.986). Our results suggest that the lower level of serum IL-33 is associated with large infarction volume and greater stroke severity in AIS patients. Thus, IL-33 can be used as a novel and independent diagnostic and predicting prognostic marker in AIS.",

    "abstract": "Medical advances made over the last century have increased our lifespan, but age-related diseases are a fundamental health burden worldwide. Aging is therefore a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity, and neurodegenerative diseases, all increasing in prevalence. However, huge inter-individual variations in aging and disease risk exist, which cannot be explained by chronological age, but rather physiological age decline initiated even at young age due to lifestyle. At the heart of this lies the metabolic system and how this is regulated in each individual. Metabolic turnover of food to energy leads to accumulation of co-factors, byproducts, and certain proteins, which all influence gene expression through epigenetic regulation. How these epigenetic markers accumulate over time is now being investigated as the possible link between aging and many diseases, such as cancer. The relationship between metabolism and cancer was described as early as the late 1950s by Dr. Otto Warburg, before the identification of DNA and much earlier than our knowledge of epigenetics. However, when the stepwise gene mutation theory of cancer was presented, Warburg's theories garnered little attention. Only in the last decade, with epigenetic discoveries, have Warburg's data on the metabolic shift in cancers been brought back to life. The stepwise gene mutation theory fails to explain why large animals with more cells, do not have a greater cancer incidence than humans, known as Peto's paradox. The resurgence of research into the Warburg effect has given us insight to what may explain Peto's paradox. In this review, we discuss these connections and how age-related changes in metabolism are tightly linked to cancer development, which is further affected by lifestyle choices modulating the risk of aging and cancer through epigenetic control.",

    "abstract": "Obesity has been associated with higher risk of frailty in older adults, but the pathophysiological mechanisms are unclear. No previous study has examined the association between leptin, an adipokine, and the risk of frailty in older adults, and whether this association could be explained by insulin resistance or chronic inflammation. Data were taken from 1,573 individuals without diabetes mellitus, aged ≥60 years, from the Seniors-ENRICA cohort. In 2008-2010, leptin, the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured. Study participants were followed-up through 2012 to assess incident frailty, defined as at least two of the following Fried criteria: exhaustion, weakness, low physical activity, and slow walking speed. Analyses were performed with logistic regression and adjusted for the main confounders. Over a median follow-up of 3.5 years, 280 cases of incident frailty were identified. Compared to individuals in the lowest tertile of serum leptin, those in the highest tertile showed an increased risk of frailty (odds ratio [OR]: 2.12; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.47-3.06; p-trend <0.001). Further adjustment for the percentage of body fat led to an OR of 1.69 (95% CI: 1.11-2.61; p-trend=0.01). After additional adjustment for HOMA-IR and CRP, the OR for frailty was 1.59 (95% CI: 1.01-2.52; p-trend=0.04). Results did not vary according to sex, abdominal obesity or the percentage of body fat. Being in the highest versus lowest tertile of leptin was associated with increased risk of exhaustion (OR: 2.16; 95% CI: 1.32-3.55; p-trend=0.001) and muscle weakness (OR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.25-2.51; p-trend=0.001), in the analyses adjusted for potential confounders and body fat. Higher leptin concentration was associated with greater risk of frailty in older adults. This association was only modestly explained by insulin resistance and chronic inflammation, as measured by CRP.",

    "abstract": "Recent research shows that energy metabolism can strongly influence proteostasis and thereby affect onset of aging and related disease such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Changes in glycolytic and proteolytic activities (influenced by diet and development) are suggested to synergistically create a self-reinforcing deleterious cycle via enhanced formation of triose phosphates (dihydroxyacetone-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate) and their decomposition product methylglyoxal (MG). It is proposed that triose phosphates and/or MG contribute to the development of PD and its attendant pathophysiological symptoms. MG can induce many of the macromolecular modifications (e.g. protein glycation) which characterise the aged-phenotype. MG can also react with dopamine to generate a salsolinol-like product, 1-acetyl-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinaline (ADTIQ), which accumulates in the Parkinson's disease (PD) brain and whose effects on mitochondria, analogous to MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), closely resemble changes associated with PD. MG can directly damage the intracellular proteolytic apparatus and modify proteins into non-degradable (cross-linked) forms. It is suggested that increased endogenous MG formation may result from either, or both, enhanced glycolytic activity and decreased proteolytic activity and contribute to the macromolecular changes associated with PD. Carnosine, a naturally-occurring dipeptide, may ameliorate MG-induced effects due, in part, to its carbonyl-scavenging activity. The possibility that ingestion of highly glycated proteins could also contribute to age-related brain dysfunction is briefly discussed.",

Thanks to advance in new treatments, mortality from ovarian cancer has declined in developed countries in the last decade. This decline in mortality rate is unevenly distributed across the age-spectrum. While mortality in younger women has decreased 21.7%, for elderly women it has declined only 2.2%. Even if ovarian cancer is clearly a disease of the elderly, older women are underrepresented in clinical trials, and scant evidence exists for the treatment of women older than 80 years. Moreover, older women are frequently undertreated, receive less chemotherapy and less combination of surgery and chemotherapy, despite the fact that this is considered the optimal treatment modality. This may be mainly due to the lack of evidence and physician's confidence in the management of elderly women with ovarian cancer. In this review, we focus on the management of older women with ovarian cancer, considering geriatric features tied to this population.",

    "abstract": "With the expansion of the elderly population, age-related osteoporosis and the resulting bone loss have become a significant health and socioeconomic issue. In Triple Energizer (TE)/San Jiao (SJ)/mesenchymal tissue system, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) senescence, and impaired osteogenesis are thought to contribute to age-related diseases such as osteoporosis. Therefore, comprehending the molecular mechanisms underlying MSC senescence and osteogenesis is essential to improve the treatment of bone metabolic diseases. With the increasing role of miRNAs in MSC aging and osteogenic differentiation, we need to understand further how miRNAs participate in relevant mechanisms. In this study, we observed that the expression of miR-1292 was augmented during cellular senescence and lessened with osteogenesis in human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADSCs). miR-1292 expression was positively correlated with senescence markers and negatively associated with bone formation markers in clinical bone samples. Overexpression of miR-1292 notably accelerated hADSC senescence and restrained osteogenesis, whereas its knockdown decreased senescence and enhanced osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, miR-1292 upregulation inhibited ectopic bone formation in vivo. Mechanistically, FZD4 was identified as a potential target of miR-1292. Downregulation of FZD4 phenocopied the effect of miR-1292 overexpression on hADSC senescence and osteogenic differentiation. Moreover, the impact of miR-1292 suppression on senescence and osteogenesis were reversed by the FZD4 knockdown. Pathway analysis revealed that miR-1292 regulates hADSC senescence and osteogenesis through the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Thus, TE/SJ/mesenchymal tissue system is the largest organ composed of various functional cells derived from mesoderm, responsible for maintaining homeostasis and regulating cell senescence. miR-1292 might serve as a novel therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis or other diseases related to bone metabolism and aging.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective impairment of upper and lower motor neurons. We aimed to investigate the genetic spectrum and variability in Chinese patients with ALS. A total of 24 familial ALS (FALS) and 21 early-onset sporadic ALS (SALS) of Chinese ancestry were enrolled. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed in the probands, followed by verification by Sanger sequencing and co-segregation analysis. Clinical features of patients with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were present. The mutation frequency of ALS-related genes was then analyzed in Chinese population. In this cohort, 17 known mutations (9 SOD1, 5 FUS, 2 TARDBP and one SETX) were identified in 14 FALS and 6 early-onset SALS. Moreover, 7 novel variants (SOD1 c.112G>C, OPTN c.811C>T, ERBB4 c.965T>A, DCTN1 c.1915C>T, NEFH c.2602G>A, NEK1 c.3622G>A, and TAF15 c.1535G>A) were identified. In southeastern Chinese FALS, the mutation frequency of SOD1, FUS, and TARDBP was 52.9%, 8.8%, 8.8% respectively. In early-onset SALS, FUS mutations were the most common (22.6%). In Chinese ALS cases, p.H47R is most frequent SOD1 mutations, while p.R521 is most common FUS mutation and p.M337V is most common TARDBP mutation. Our results revealed that mutations in SOD1, FUS and TARDBP are the most common cause of Chinese FALS, while FUS mutations are the most common cause of early-onset SALS. The genetic spectrum is different between Chinese ALS and Caucasian ALS.",

In gaining a better understanding of the inevitable aging process, the hope is to preserve, promote, or delay healthy aging through the treatment of common age-associated diseases. Although there are theories that try to explain the aging process, none of them seem to fully satisfy. Microcirculation describes blood flow through the capillaries in the circulatory system. The main functions of the microcirculation are the delivery of oxgen and nutrients and the removal of CO2, metabolic debris, and toxins. The microcirculatory impairment or dysfunction over time will result in the accumulation of toxic products and CO2 and loss of nutrition supplementation and O2 in corresponding tissue systems or internal organs, which eventually affect normal tissue and organ functions, leading to aging. Therefore, I propose a microcirculatory theory of aging: aging is the process of continuous impairment of microcirculation in the body.",

    "abstract": "Advanced chronic liver disease (aCLD) represents a major public health concern. aCLD is more prevalent and severe in the elderly, carrying a higher risk of decompensation. We aimed at understanding how aging may impact on the pathophysiology of aCLD in aged rats and humans and secondly, at evaluating simvastatin as a therapeutic option in aged animals. aCLD was induced in young (1 month) and old (16 months) rats. A subgroup of aCLD-old animals received simvastatin (5 mg/kg) or vehicle (PBS) for 15 days. Hepatic and systemic hemodynamic, liver cells phenotype and hepatic fibrosis were evaluated. Additionally, the gene expression signature of cirrhosis was evaluated in a cohort of young and aged cirrhotic patients. Aged animals developed a more severe form of aCLD. Portal hypertension and liver fibrosis were exacerbated as a consequence of profound deregulations in the phenotype of the main hepatic cells: hepatocytes presented more extensive cell-death and poorer function, LSEC were further capillarized, HSC over-activated and macrophage infiltration was significantly increased. The gene expression signature of cirrhosis significantly differed comparing young and aged patients, indicating alterations in sinusoidal-protective pathways and confirming the pre-clinical observations. Simvastatin administration for 15-day to aged cirrhotic rats improved the hepatic sinusoidal milieu, leading to significant amelioration in portal hypertension. This study provides evidence that aCLD pathobiology is different in aged individuals. As the median age of patients with aCLD is increasing, we propose a real-life pre-clinical model to develop more reliable therapeutic strategies. Simvastatin effects in this model further demonstrate its translational potential.",

The influence of TG/HDL-C on acute ischemic stroke remains elusive. The purpose of this study was to investigate the precise effect of TG/HDL-C on 3-month mortality after acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Patients with AIS were enrolled in the present study from 2011 to 2017. A total of 1459 participants from a single city in China were divided into retrospective training and prospective test cohorts. Medical records were collected periodically to determine the incidence of fatal events. All participants were followed for 3 months. Optimal cutoff values were determined using X-tile software to separate the training cohort patients into higher and lower survival groups based on their lipid levels. A survival analysis was conducted using Kaplan-Meier curves and a Cox proportional hazards regression model. A total of 1459 patients with AIS (median age 68.5 years, 58.5% male) were analyzed. Univariate Cox regression analysis confirmed that TG/HDL-C was a significant prognostic factor for 3-month survival. X-tile identified 0.9 as an optimal cutoff for TG/HDL-C. In the univariate analysis, the prognosis of the TG/HDL-C >0.9 group was markedly superior to that of TG/HDL-C ≤0.9 group (P<0.001). A multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that TG/HDL-C was independently correlated with a reduced risk of mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.62; P<0.001). These results were confirmed in the 453 patients in the test cohort. A nomogram was constructed to predict 3-month case-fatality, and the c-indexes of predictive accuracy were 0.684 and 0.670 in the training and test cohorts, respectively (P<0.01). The serum TG/HDL-C ratio may be useful for predicting short-term mortality after AIS.",

This study compared levels of physical activity (i.e., sedentary behavior, light physical activity (LPA), and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA)) and rates of meeting public health guidelines for MVPA (i.e., ≥30 min/day) among young (i.e., ages 20-39 years), middle-aged (i.e., ages 40-59 years) and older adults (i.e., ages ≥60 years) with MS. The sample included 963 persons with MS who provided demographic and clinical information and wore an accelerometer for a 7-day period. The primary analysis involved a between-subjects ANOVA on accelerometer variables (i.e., accelerometer wear time; number of valid days; sedentary behavior in min/day; LPA in min/day; and MVPA in min/day). Collectively, our data indicated that older adults with MS engaged in less MVPA and more sedentary behavior than middle-aged and young adults with MS. Such results highlight the importance of developing physical activity interventions as an effective means for managing the progression and consequences of MS in older adults.",

Male adult C57BL/6 mice (25-30g) were subjected to 45 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). EPO (5000 IU/kg) or saline was injected intraperitoneally every other day after reperfusion. Neurological function was evaluated using the rotarod test at 1, 3, 7 and 14 days after MCAO. Brain tissue loss volume was determined by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot were also used to assess the severity of white matter injury and phenotypic changes in microglia/macrophages. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected intraperitoneally daily for 1 week to analyze the number of newly proliferating glia cells (oligodendrocytes, microglia, and astrocytes). We found that EPO significantly reduced Brain tissue loss volume, ameliorated white matter injury, and improved neurobehavioral outcomes at 14 days after MCAO (P<0.05). In addition, EPO also increased the number of newly generated oligodendrocytes and attenuated the rapid hypertrophy and hyperplasia of microglia and astrocytes after ischemic stroke (P<0.05). Furthermore, EPO reduced M1 microglia and increased M2 microglia (P<0.05). Taken together, our results suggest that EPO treatment improves white matter integrity after cerebral ischemia, which could be attributed to EPO attenuating gliosis and facilitating the microglial polarization toward the beneficial M2 phenotype to promote oligodendrogenesis.",

CCCs include the family of Na+-coupled Cl- importers (NCC, NKCC1, and NKCC2), K+-coupled Cl- exporters (KCCs), and possibly polyamine transporters (CCC9) and CCC interacting protein (CIP1). For decades, CCCs have been the targets of several commonly used diuretic drugs, including hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide, and bumetanide. Genetic mutations of NCC and NKCC2 cause congenital renal tubular disorders and lead to renal salt-losing hypotension, secondary hyperreninemia, and hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. New studies reveal that CCCs along with their regulatory WNK (Kinase with no lysine (K)), and SPAK (Ste20-related proline-alanine-rich kinase)/OSR1(oxidative stress-responsive kinase-1) are essential for regulating cell volume and maintaining ionic homeostasis in the nervous system, especially roles of the WNK-SPAK-NKCC1 signaling pathway in ischemic brain injury and hypersecretion of cerebrospinal fluid in post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus. In addition, disruption of Cl- exporter KCC2 has an effect on synaptic inhibition, which may be involved in developing pain, epilepsy, and possibly some neuropsychiatric disorders. Interference with KCC3 leads to peripheral nervous system neuropathy as well as axon and nerve fiber swelling and psychosis. The WNK-SPAK/OSR1-CCCs complex emerges as therapeutic targets for multiple neurological diseases. This review will highlight these new findings.",

We conducted <i>in vitro</i> assays and metabolomics analysis in mice to evaluate metformin's action on the brain metabolism.

Using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, we examined the long-term risk of developing ESRD along with their risk of mortality, supplemented by a competing risk analysis against mortality. Among all participants, 66.2% (n=109,586), 27.2% (n=44,986), 5.9% (n=9,799), and 0.7% (n=1090) patients did not have or had 1, 2, and ≥3 frailty components, respectively. After a 4.1-year follow-up, 4.2% patients developed ESRD and 18.5% died.

Competing risk analysis showed that frailty-induced ESRD risk was attenuated partially by mortality in those with moderate frailty. The receipt of palliative care did not attenuate this risk.

    "abstract": "Aging is a progressive loss of physiological integrity and functionality process which increases susceptibility and mortality to diseases. Vascular aging is a specific type of organic aging. The structure and function changes of endothelial cells (ECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are the main cause of vascular aging, which could influence the threshold, process, and severity of vascular related diseases. Accumulating evidences demonstrate that exosomes serve as novel intercellular information communicator between cell to cell by delivering variety biologically active cargos, especially exosomal non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which are associated with most of aging-related biological and functional disorders. In this review, we will summerize the emerging roles and mechanisms of exosomal ncRNAs in vascular aging and vascular aging related diseases, focusing on the role of exosomal miRNAs and lncRNAs in regulating the functions of ECs and VSMCs. Moreover, the relationship between the ECs and VSMCs linked by exosomes, the potential diagnostic and therapeutic application of exosomes in vascular aging and the clinical evaluation and treatment of vascular aging and vascular aging related diseases will also be discussed.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is often associated with postural instability and gait dysfunction that can increase the risk for falls and associated consequences, including injuries, increased burden on healthcare resources, and reduced quality of life.Patients with PD have nearly twice the risk for falls and associated bone fractures compared with their general population counterparts of similar age.Although the cause of falls in patients with PD may be multifactorial, an often under-recognized factor is neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH).nOH is a sustained decrease in blood pressure upon standing whose symptomology can include dizziness/lightheadedness, weakness, fatigue, and syncope.nOH is due to dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system compensatory response to standing and is a consequence of the neurodegenerative processes of PD.The symptoms associated with orthostatic hypotension (OH)/nOH can increase the risk of falls, and healthcare professionals may not be aware of the real-world clinical effect of nOH, the need for routine screening, or the value of early diagnosis of nOH when treating elderly patients with PD. nOH is easily missed and, importantly, healthcare providers may not realize that there are effective treatments for nOH symptoms that could help lessen the fall risk resulting from the condition.This review discusses the burden of, and key risk factors for, falls among patients with PD, with a focus on practical approaches for the recognition, assessment, and successful management of OH/nOH.In addition, insights are provided as to how fall patterns can suggest fall etiology, thereby influencing the choice of intervention.",

ROS-induced PKCδ activation is linked to mitochondrial dysfunction in human cells. However, the role of PKCδ in cardiac and mitochondrial dysfunction caused by AGE in diabetes is still unclear. AGE-BSA-treated cardiac cells showed dose- and time-dependent cell apoptosis, ROS generation, and selective PKCδ activation, which were reversed by NAC and rotenone. Similar tendency was also observed in diabetic and obese animal hearts. Furthermore, enhanced apoptosis and reduced survival signaling by AGE-BSA or PKCδ-WT transfection were reversed by kinase-deficient (KD) of PKCδ transfection or PKCδ inhibitor, respectively, indicating that AGE-BSA-induced cardiomyocyte death is PKCδ-dependent. Increased levels of mitochondrial mass as well as mitochondrial fission by AGE-BSA or PKCδ activator were reduced by rottlerin, siPKCδ or KD transfection, indicating that the AGE-BSA-induced mitochondrial damage is PKCδ-dependent. Using super-resolution microscopy, we confirmed that PKCδ colocalized with mitochondria. Interestingly, the mitochondrial functional analysis by Seahorse XF-24 flux analyzer showed similar results. Our findings indicated that cardiac PKCδ activation mediates AGE-BSA-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis via ROS production and may play a key role in the development of cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction in rats with diabetes and obesity.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is more prevalent in aging populations. Older adults with diabetes have higher rates of macro and micro vascular complications. Our study assessed whether age is an independent factor for both large and small nerve dysfunctions in Chinese patients with T2DM. This cross-sectional study involved a total of 950 patients with type 2 diabetes (mean age: 60.01±12.30 years). Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) was assessed according to clinical symptoms and physical examinations by using neuropathy symptom score (NSS), the neuropathy disability score (NDS), Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI score), vibration perception threshold (VPT) and SUDOSCAN test. By using independent logistic regression model, we showed that age was an independent risk factor of DPN (odds ratio [OR] = 1.036, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.018-1.054, P< 0.01). T2DM patients over 71 years had a higher risk of DPN determined by using NSS/NDS (OR= 2.087; 95% CI 1.112-3.918; P <0.05), MNSI (OR=1.922; 95% CI 1.136-3.252; P<0.05), VPT (OR=3.452; 95%CI 1.052-11.332; P<0.05) and SUDOSCAN (OR=1.922; 95%CI 1.136-3.252; P<0.05) as diagnostic criteria respectively. The results of spline analysis showed a non-linearly positive association between age and OR of DPN. Individuals with 40, 50, 60, and 70 years old had LnOR of 1.22 (95%CI: 0.44- 2.00), 1.79(95%CI: 0.67- 2.91), 2.29 (95% CI: 0.98- 3.59), and 2.67(95% CI: 1.38-3.96) in DPN risk compared to T2DM patients with 19 years old, respectively. All of the above results in our study suggested age as an independent risk factor for the development of diabetic neuropathy in T2DM patients is significantly associated with the occurrence of both small and large nerve dysfunction, independent of other risk factors.",

    "abstract": "Dietary proteins are sources of some amino acid precursors of two neurotransmitters relevant for biological rhythms, serotonin and melatonin, which are involved in sleep and alertness. Meat is the main source of proteins in many countries. Furthermore, meat consumption is of special interest because it provides high-quality protein as well as saturated and <i>trans</i> fatty acids. However, its effect on sleep patterns is unclear. Thereby, the aim was to examine the association of habitual meat consumption with changes in sleep duration and with sleep quality in older adults. We used data from 1,341 participants in the Seniors-ENRICA cohort aged ≥60 years, followed from 2012 through 2015. Habitual meat consumption was assessed at baseline with a validated diet history. Sleep duration and quality were ascertained both in 2012 and 2015. Analyses were performed with logistic regression and adjusted for socio-demographic variables, lifestyle, morbidity, sleep duration and poor sleep indicators at baseline. During follow-up, 9.0% of individuals increased and 7.9% decreased their sleep duration by ≥2 hours/night. Compared with individuals in the lowest tertile of meat consumption (<87 g/d), those in the highest tertile (≥128 g/d) showed increased incidence of a large decrease (≥2 h) in sleep duration (OR: 1.93; 95% CI:1.01-3.72; p-trend:0.04). Higher consumption of meat was also associated with incidence of snoring (OR:2.06; 95% CI:1.17-3.60; p-trend:0.01) and poor general sleep quality (OR:1.71; 95% CI:1.04-2.82; p-trend:0.03). Each 100 g/d increment in meat intake was associated with a 60% higher risk of both large sleep duration changes and poor sleep quality (OR:1.60; 95% CI:1.07-2.40). Results were in the same direction for red and processed meat and for white meat separately, and among individuals with physical impairment. Higher meat consumption (≥128 g/d) was associated with changes in sleep duration and with poor sleep in older adults.",

    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been extensively investigated in recent decades to identify groups with a high risk of dementia and to establish effective prevention methods during this period. Neuropsychological performance and cortical thickness are two important biomarkers used to predict progression from MCI to dementia. This study compares the cortical thickness and neuropsychological performance in people with MCI and cognitively healthy older adults. We further focus on the relationship between cortical thickness and neuropsychological performance in these two groups. Forty-nine participants with MCI and 40 cognitively healthy older adults were recruited. Cortical thickness was analysed with semiautomatic software, Freesurfer. The analysis reveals that the cortical thickness in the left caudal anterior cingulate (p=0.041), lateral occipital (p=0.009) and right superior temporal (p=0.047) areas were significantly thinner in the MCI group after adjustment for age and education. Almost all neuropsychological test results (with the exception of forward digit span) were significantly correlated to cortical thickness in the MCI group after adjustment for age, gender and education. In contrast, only the score on the Category Verbal Fluency Test and the forward digit span were found to have significant inverse correlations to cortical thickness in the control group of cognitively healthy older adults. The study results suggest that cortical thinning in the temporal region reflects the global change in cognition in subjects with MCI and may be useful to predict progression of MCI to Alzheimer's disease. The different pattern in the correlation of cortical thickness to the neuropsychological performance of patients with MCI from the healthy control subjects may be explained by the hypothesis of MCI as a disconnection syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Dietary interventions such as prolonged calorie restriction (CR) and intermittent fasting provide health benefits including a reduction in the inflammatory burden and regulation of energy metabolism. During CR, β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) level is elevated in the serum. BHB is a ligand of GPR109A, which inhibits lipolysis and exerts anti-inflammatory effects on cells. During aging, comorbidities related to dyslipidemia are significantly associated with fatty liver. However, the underlying mechanisms of BHB in hepatic ER stress and dyslipidemia are unclear and remain to be elucidated. Here, we used aged rats that were administered with BHB and compared the modulatory effects of BHB through the GPR109A/AMPK pathway on the hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and lipid accumulation to CR rats. BHB caused suppression of hepatic ER stress and lipid accumulation through GPR109A/AMPK pathway in the aged rats. Aged rats of both treatment groups showed reduced cAMP level and PKA phosphorylation. Furthermore, AMPK-Ser173 phosphorylation via PKA was decreased, whereas AMPK-Thr172 phosphorylation was increased by BHB and CR. Further supporting evidence was provided in HepG2 cells that BHB inhibited ER stress and lipid accumulation induced by palmitate. These results suggest that BHB activates GPR109A and regulates the activation of AMPK. These findings were further confirmed by GPR109A-siRNA transfection <i>in vitro</i>. In addition, BHB treatment elevated the protein levels of AMPK leading to significant inhibition of hepatic steatosis, whereas AMPK-siRNA treatment abolished these effects. Taken together, these findings suggest that BHB could be a effective molecule that mimics CR in ameliorating age-related hepatic lipid accumulation via GPR109A signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "The heart is the first functional organ that develops during embryonic development. While a heartbeat indicates life, cessation of a heartbeat signals the end of life. Heart disease, due either to congenital defects or to acquired dysfunctions in adulthood, remains the leading cause of death worldwide. Epigenetics plays a key role in both embryonic heart development and heart disease in adults. Stress-induced vascular injury activates pathways involved in pathogenesis of accelerated cardiac aging that includes cellular dysfunction, pathological cardiac hypertrophy, diabetic cardiomyopathy, cardiac matrix remodeling, cardiac dysfunction and heart failure. Acetyltransferase p300 (p300), a major epigenetic regulator, plays a pivotal role in heart development during embryogenesis, as deficiency or abnormal expression of p300 leads to embryonic death at early gestation periods due to deformation of the heart and neural tube. Acetyltransferase p300 controls heart development through histone acetylation-mediated chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation of genes required for cardiac development. In adult hearts, p300 is differentially expressed in different chambers and epigenetically controls cardiac gene expression. Deregulation of p300, in response to prohypertrophic and profibrogenic stress signals, is associated with increased recruitment of p300 to several genes including transcription factors, increased acetylation of specific lysines in histones and transcription factors, altered chromatin organization, and increased hypertrophic and fibrogenic gene expression. Cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial fibrogenesis are common pathological manifestations of several stress-induced accelerated cardiac aging-related pathologies, including high blood pressure-induced or environmentally induced cardiac hypertrophy, myocardial infarction, diabetes-induced cardiomyopathy, and heart failure. Numerous studies using cellular and animal models clearly indicate that pharmacologic or genetic normalization of p300 activity has the potential to prevent or halt the progression of cardiac aging pathologies. Based on these preclinical studies, development of safe, non-toxic, small molecule inhibitors/epidrugs targeting p300 is an ideal approach to control accelerated cardiac aging-related deaths worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Societies in developed countries are aging at an unprecedented rate. Considering that aging is the most significant risk factor for many chronic lung diseases (CLDs), understanding this process may facilitate the development of new interventionist approaches. Skeletal muscle dysfunction is a serious problem in older adults with CLDs, reducing their quality of life and survival. In this study, we reviewed the possible links between handgrip strength (HGS)—a simple, noninvasive, low-cost measure of muscle function—and CLDs in the elderly. Different mechanisms appear to be involved in this association, including systemic inflammation, chronic hypoxemia, physical inactivity, malnutrition, and corticosteroid use. Respiratory and peripheral myopathy, associated with muscle atrophy and a shift in muscle fiber type, also seem to be major etiological contributors to CLDs. Moreover, sarcopenic obesity, which occurs in older adults with CLDs, impairs common inflammatory pathways that can potentiate each other and further accelerate the functional decline of HGS. Our findings support the concept that the systemic effects of CLDs may be determined by HGS, and HGS is a relevant measurement that should be considered in the clinical assessment of the elderly with CLDs. These reasons make HGS a useful practical tool for indirectly evaluating functional status in the elderly. At present, early muscle reconditioning and optimal nutrition appear to be the most effective approaches to reduce the impact of CLDs and low muscle strength on the quality of life of these individuals. Nonetheless, larger in-depth studies are needed to evaluate the link between HGS and CLDs.",

The mortality rate of PAH remains high, although multiple therapeutic strategies have been implemented in clinical practice.

Existing drugs developed to treat the disease have resulted in enormous economic and healthcare liabilities. The estimated cost for advanced PAH has exceeded $200,000 per year. The pathogenesis of PAH is associated with numerous molecular processes.

Angelica sinensis polysaccharide (ASP), the major bioactive component that can extracted from roots of angelica, plays functional roles in immunomodulation, anti-tumor activity, and hematopoiesis. Emerging evidence has suggested that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in pathophysiological processes in various diseases. However, the roles of lncRNAs and ASP in IPF remain poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the effects of ASP in IPF, as well as their functional interactions with lncRNA DANCR (differentiation antagonizing non-protein coding RNA). IPF models were established by treating Sprague-Dawley rats with BLM and treating alveolar type Ⅱ epithelial (RLE-6TN) cells with TGF-β1. Our results showed that ASP treatment suppressed pulmonary fibrosis in rats and fibrogenesis in RLE-6TN cells. The lncRNA DANCR is downregulated after ASP treatment in both rat lung tissues and RLE-6TN cells, and DANCR overexpression dramatically reversed the suppressive effects of ASP in IPF. Mechanistically, DANCR directly binds with AUF1 (AU-binding factor 1), thereby upregulating FOXO3 mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, overexpression of AUF1 or FOXO3 reversed the functional effects induced by ASP treatment. In conclusion, our findings showed that DANCR mediates ASP-induced suppression of IPF via upregulation of FOXO3 protein levels in an AUF1-dependent manner. Therefore, DANCR could serve as a promising therapeutic target in IPF treatment with ASP.",

Although our previous study has reported chronic inflammation in aged microglia, the mechanism remains poorly understood.

Six subgroups of microglia with unique function were identified by single cell RNA sequencing. Three out of six subgroups showed dramatic variations in microglia between aged and young mice. A unique type of highly-activated microglia (HAM) was observed in aged mice only, with specific expression of several markers, including Lpl, Lgals3, Cst7, and Cd74. Gene clusters with functional implications in cell survival, energy metabolism, and immuno-inflammatory responses were markedly activated in HAM. Mechanistically, neuron-released Mif, acting through Cd74 receptor in HAM, promoted the immunochemotactic activity of microglia, which then triggered immuno-inflammatory responses in aged brains.

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia is a common geriatric disorder characterized by decreased muscle strength, low muscle mass and poor physical performance. This aging-related skeletal muscle deterioration leads to adverse outcomes and severely impairs the quality of life of patients. The accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria with aging is an important factor in the occurrence and progression of sarcopenia. Mitochondrial quality control (MQC) fundamentally ensures the normal mitochondrial functions and is comprised of four main parts: proteostasis, biogenesis, dynamics and autophagy. Therefore, any pathophysiologic factors compromising the quality control of homeostasis in the skeletal muscle may lead to sarcopenia. However, the specific theoretical aspects of these processes have not been fully elucidated. Current therapeutic interventions using nutritional and pharmaceutical treatments show a modest therapeutic efficacy; however, only physical exercise is recommended as the first-line therapy for sarcopenia, which can ameliorate skeletal muscle deficiency by maintaining the homeostatic MQC. In this review, we summarized the known mechanisms that contribute to the pathogenesis of sarcopenia by impairing normal mitochondrial functions and described potential interventions that mitigate sarcopenia through improving MQC.",

    "abstract": "The elderly population will significantly increase in the next decade and, with it, the proportion of people affected by age-related diseases. Among them, one of the most invalidating is Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by motor- and non-motor dysfunctions which strongly impair the quality of life of affected individuals. PD is characterized by the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, with consequent dopamine depletion, and the accumulation of misfolded α-synuclein aggregates. Although 150 years have passed since PD first description, no effective therapies are currently available, but only palliative treatments. Importantly, PD is often diagnosed when the neuronal loss is elevated, making difficult any therapeutic intervention. In this context, two key challenges remain unanswered: (i) the early diagnosis to avoid the insurgence of irreversible symptoms; and (ii) the reliable monitoring of therapy efficacy. Research strives to identify novel biomarkers for PD diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic follow-up. One of the most promising sources of biomarkers is represented by extracellular vesicles (EVs), a heterogeneous population of nanoparticles, released by all cells in the microenvironment. Brain-derived EVs are able to cross the blood-brain barrier, protecting their payload from enzymatic degradation, and are easily recovered from biofluids. Interestingly, EV content is strongly influenced by the specific pathophysiological status of the donor cell. In this manuscript, the role of EVs as source of novel PD biomarkers is discussed, providing all recent findings concerning relevant proteins and miRNAs carried by PD patient-derived EVs, from several biological specimens. Moreover, the contribution of mitochondria-derived EVs will be dissected. Finally, the promising possibility to use EVs as source of markers to monitor PD therapy efficacy will be also examined. In the future, larger cohort studies will help to validate these EV-associated candidates, that might be effectively used as non-invasive and robust source of biomarkers for PD.",

Due to the novel nature and the lack of immunity within humans, there has been a collective global effort to find effective treatments against the virus. This has led the scientific community to repurpose Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs with known safety profiles. Of the many possible drugs, vitamin C has been on the shortlist of possible interventions due to its beneficial role as an immune booster and inherent antioxidant properties. Within this manuscript, a detailed discussion regarding the intracellular function and inherent properties of vitamin C is conducted. It also provides a comprehensive review of published research pertaining to the differences in expression of the vitamin C transporter under several pathophysiologic conditions. Finally, we review recently published research investigating the efficacy of vitamin C administration in treating viral infection and life-threatening conditions. Overall, this manuscript aims to present existing information regarding the extent to which vitamin C can be an effective treatment for COVID-19 and possible explanations as to why it may work in some individuals but not in others.",

    "abstract": "Although revascularization rates after endovascular thrombectomy for large vessel acute ischemic stroke (AIS) are high (71%), only 46% of patients achieve functional independence at 90 days. The present study was designed to explore a new method for predicting the functional prognosis of AIS patients after endovascular recanalization. A total of 200 anterior circulation stroke patients who received endovascular therapy were enrolled. Logistic regression analysis of clinical characteristics on functional independence were performed. The predictive power of sub-items in National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) and the combination of NIHSS consciousness and Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) on functional independence were assessed by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and the latter was compared with 3 previously published prediction models by AUC (the area under ROC curve). The AUC for the NIHSS consciousness score to predict functional independence was higher than whole NIHSS and other sub-items (0.716 v 0.705, 0.586, 0.573, 0.552 and 0.559). Low NIHSS consciousness score, high ASPECTS score, short time from onset to recanalization, and high rate of successful recanalization were demonstrated to be significantly associated with the functional independence (OR 0.697, 2.226, 0.994 and 28.643). The prediction power of the combination was significantly better than NIHSS and ASPECTS alone (AUC 0.793 v 0.705 and 0.752). Compared with 3 other prediction models, the combination was found to be the strongest predictor for functional independence (AUC 0.793 v 0.791, 0.671 and 0.564). NIHSS which has been shown to be a strong predictor of functional outcomes after endovascular recanalization is largely dependent on the consciousness component. NIHSS consciousness score combined with ASPECTS appears to be a favorable predictor of functional independence. These findings may have broad reaching effects for isolated centers around the world without advanced imaging for triage and prognostication.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects the basic ability to function and has imposed an immense burden on the community and health care system. Focused ultrasound (FUS) has recently been proposed as a novel noninvasive therapeutic approach for AD. However, systematic reviews on the FUS application in AD treatment have not been forthcoming. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria to summarize the techniques associated with safety and efficacy, as well as possible underlying mechanisms of FUS effects on AD in animal and human studies. Animal studies demonstrated FUS with microbubbles (FUS-MB) induced blood-brain-barrier (BBB) opening that could facilitate various therapeutic agents entering the brain. Repeated FUS-MB and FUS stimulation can relieve AD pathology and improve cognitive and memory function. Human studies showed repeated FUS-MB are well tolerated with few adverse events and FUS stimulation could enhance local perfusion and neural function, which correlated with cognitive improvement. We conclude that FUS is a feasible and safe therapeutic and drug delivery strategy for AD. However, FUS treatment on humans is still in the early stages and requires further optimization and standardization.",

    "abstract": "Articular cartilage (AC) has a very limited intrinsic repair capacity after injury or disease. Although exogenous cell-based regenerative approaches have obtained acceptable outcomes, they are usually associated with complicated procedures, donor-site morbidities and cell differentiation during ex vivo expansion. In recent years, endogenous regenerative strategy by recruiting resident mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSPCs) into the injured sites, as a promising alternative, has gained considerable attention. It takes full advantage of body's own regenerative potential to repair and regenerate injured tissue while avoiding exogenous regenerative approach-associated limitations. Like most tissues, there are also multiple stem-cell niches in AC and its surrounding tissues. These MSPCs have the potential to migrate into injured sites to produce replacement cells under appropriate stimuli. Traditional microfracture procedure employs the concept of MSPCs recruitment usually fails to regenerate normal hyaline cartilage. The reasons for this failure might be attributed to an inadequate number of recruiting cells and adverse local tissue microenvironment after cartilage injury. A strategy that effectively improves local matrix microenvironment and recruits resident MSPCs may enhance the success of endogenous AC regeneration (EACR). In this review, we focused on the reasons why AC cannot regenerate itself in spite of potential self-repair capacity and summarized the latest developments of the three key components in the field of EACR. In addition, we discussed the challenges facing in the present EACR strategy. This review will provide an increasing understanding of EACR and attract more researchers to participate in this promising research arena.",

NAD+ is synthesised through the de novo and salvage pathways, whereas coenzyme II cannot be synthesised de novo. NAD+ is a precursor of coenzyme II. Although NAD+ is synthesised in sufficient amounts under normal conditions, shortage in its supply due to over consumption and its decreased synthesis has been observed with increasing age and under certain disease conditions. Several studies have proved that in a wide range of tissues, such as liver, skin, muscle, pancreas, and fat, the level of NAD+ decreases with age. However, in the brain tissue, the level of NADH gradually increases and that of NAD+ decreases in aged people. The ratio of NAD+/NADH indicates the cellular redox state. A decrease in this ratio affects the cellular anaerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation functions, which reduces the ability of cells to produce ATP. Therefore, increasing the exogenous NAD+ supply under certain disease conditions or in elderly people may be beneficial. Precursors of NAD+ have been extensively explored and have been reported to effectively increase NAD+ levels and possess a broad range of functions. In this review article, we discuss the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of NAD+ precursors.",

Five patients that did not improve in their clinical conditions after 48 hours of receiving the standard medical management used by the Medical Center and with persistent PaO2/FiO2 less than 100 mmHg were enrolled. ahUCMSC were infused IV, at dose of 1x10<sup>6</sup> per Kg of body weight over 15 minutes. Patients were monitored after the infusion to detect adverse event. Pa02/FiO2, vital signs, D-dimer, C reactive protein and total lymphocytes were monitored for 21 days after the infusion or until the patient was discharged from the hospital. Descriptive statistics were used with means or medians and standard deviation or interquartile range according to the type of variable. The Wilcoxon's rank-sum was used for stationary samples. Adverse events occurred in three patients and were easily and quickly controlled. Immediately after the infusion of ahUCMSC, constant rise of PaO2/FiO2 was observed in all patients during the first 7 days, with statistical significance. Three patients survived and were extubated on the ninth day post-infusion. Two patients died at 13 and 15 days after infusion. The infusion of ahUCMSC in patients with severe ARDS caused by COVID-19, was safe, and demonstrated its anti-inflammatory capacity in the lungs, by improving the respiratory function expressed by PaO2 / FiO2, which allowed the survival of 3 patients, with extubation at 9 days.",

    "abstract": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a serious, complex, and highly debilitating long-term illness. People with ME/CFS are typically unable to carry out their routine activities. Key hallmarks of the disease are neurological and gastrointestinal impairments accompanied by pervasive malaise that is exacerbated after physical and/or mental activity. Currently, there is no validated cure of biomarker signature for this illness. Impaired tryptophan (TRYP) metabolism is thought to play significant role in the pathobiology of ME/CFS. TRYP is an important precursor for serotonin and the essential pyridine nucleotide nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>). TRYP has been associated with the development of some parts of the brain responsible for behavioural functions. The main catabolic route for TRYP is the kynurenine pathway (KP). The KP produces NAD<sup>+</sup> and several neuroactive metabolites with neuroprotective (<i>i.e.</i>, kynurenic acid (KYNA)) and neurotoxic (<i>i.e.</i>, quinolinic acid (QUIN)) activities. Hyperactivation of the KP, whether compensatory or a driving mechanism of degeneration can limit the availability of NAD<sup>+</sup> and exacerbate the symptoms of ME/CFS. This review discusses the potential association of altered KP metabolism in ME/CFS. The review also evaluates the role of the patient’s gut microbiota on TRYP availability and KP activation. We propose that strategies aimed at raising the levels of NAD<sup>+</sup> (<i>e.g.</i>, using nicotinamide mononucleotide and nicotinamide riboside) may be a promising intervention to overcome symptoms of fatigue and to improve the quality of life in patients with ME/CFS. Future clinical trials should further assess the potential benefits of NAD<sup>+</sup> supplements for reducing some of the clinical features of ME/CFS.",

    "abstract": "Stroke is a devastating disease associated with high mortality and disability worldwide, and is generally classified as ischemic or hemorrhagic, which share certain similar pathophysiological processes. Oxidative stress is a critical factor involved in stroke-induced injury, which not only directly damages brain tissue, but also enhances a series of pathological signaling cascades, contributing to inflammation, brain edema, and neuronal death. To alleviate these serious secondary brain injuries, neuroprotective agents targeting oxidative stress inhibition may serve as a promising treatment strategy. Melatonin is a hormone secreted by the pineal gland, and has various properties, such as antioxidation, anti-inflammation, circadian rhythm modulation, and promotion of tissue regeneration. Numerous animal experiments studying stroke have confirmed that melatonin exerts considerable neuroprotective effects, partially via anti-oxidative stress. In this review, we introduce the possible role of melatonin as an antioxidant in the treatment of stroke based on the latest published studies of animal experiments and clinical research.",

Studies have shown that cardiac dysfunction is associated with abnormal BA metabolic pathways. As ligands for several nuclear receptors and membrane receptors, BAs systematically regulate the homeostasis of metabolism and participate in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), such as myocardial infarction, diabetic cardiomyopathy, atherosclerosis, arrhythmia, and heart failure. However, the molecular mechanism by which BAs trigger CVDs remains controversial. Therefore, the regulation of BA signal transduction by modulating the synthesis and composition of BAs is an interesting and novel direction for potential therapies for CVDs. Here, we mainly summarized the metabolism of BAs and their role in cardiomyocytes and noncardiomyocytes in CVDs. Moreover, we comprehensively discussed the clinical prospects of BAs in CVDs and analyzed the clinical diagnostic and application value of BAs. The latest development prospects of BAs in the field of new drug development are also prospected. We aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanism of BAs treatment in CVDs, and the relationship between BAs and CVDs may provide new avenues for the prevention and treatment of these diseases.",

    "abstract": "Unrelenting cognitive and mood impairments concomitant with incessant oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are among the significant symptoms of chronic Gulf War Illness (GWI). Curcumin (CUR), an antiinflammatory compound, has shown promise to alleviate brain dysfunction in a model of GWI following intraperitoneal administrations at a high dose. However, low bioavailability after oral treatment has hampered its clinical translation. Therefore, this study investigated the efficacy of low-dose, intermittent, oral polymer nanoparticle encapsulated CUR (nCUR) for improving brain function in a rat model of chronic GWI. Intermittent administration of 10 or 20 mg/Kg nCUR for 8 weeks in the early phase of GWI improved brain function and reduced oxidative stress (OS) and neuroinflammation. We next examined the efficacy of 12-weeks of intermittent nCUR at 10 mg/Kg in GWI animals, with treatment commencing 8 months after exposure to GWI-related chemicals and stress, mimicking treatment for the persistent cognitive and mood dysfunction displayed by veterans with GWI. GWI rats receiving nCUR exhibited better cognitive and mood function associated with improved mitochondrial function and diminished neuroinflammation in the hippocampus. Improved mitochondrial function was evident from normalized expression of OS markers, antioxidants, and mitochondrial electron transport genes, and complex proteins. Lessened neuroinflammation was noticeable from reductions in astrocyte hypertrophy, NF-kB, activated microglia with NLRP3 inflammasomes, and multiple proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, nCUR treated animals displayed enhanced neurogenesis with a normalized expression of synaptophysin puncta, and multiple genes linked to cognitive dysfunction. Thus, low-dose, intermittent, oral nCUR therapy has promise for improving brain function in veterans with GWI.",

Age appears to be one of the key factors influencing the status and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as multiple reports indicated that the majority of COVID-19 infections and severe cases are elderly. Most people simply assume that the elderly are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 than the young, but the mechanism behind it is still open to question. The older and younger people are at similar risk of infection because their infection process is the same and they must be exposed to the virus first. However, whether they will get sick after exposure to the virus and how their disease progresses depend on their immune mechanisms. In older populations, inflammation and immune aging reduce their ability to resist SARS-CoV-2 infection. Meanwhile, under the influence of comorbidities, ACE2 receptor and various cytokines undergo corresponding changes, thus accelerating the entry, replication, and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the body, promoting disease progression, and leading to severe illness and even death. In addition, the relatively fragile mental state of the elderly can also affect their timely recovery from COVID-19. Therefore, once older people are infected with SARS-CoV-2, they are more prone to severe illness and death with a poor prognosis, and they should strengthen protection to avoid exposure to the virus.",

However, developing an effective treatment for the disease requires a thorough understanding of its etiology, which is currently lacking. Although several studies have shown the association between oxidative damage and AD, only a few have clarified the specific mechanisms involved. Herein, we reviewed recent preclinical and clinical studies that indicated the significance of oxidative damage in AD, as well as potential antioxidants. Although several factors regulate oxidative stress in AD, we centered our investigation on apolipoprotein E and the gut microbiome. Apolipoprotein E, particularly apolipoprotein E-ε4, can impair the structural facets of the mitochondria. This, in turn, can minimize the mitochondrial functionality and result in the progressive build-up of free radicals, eventually leading to oxidative stress. Similarly, the gut microbiome can influence oxidative stress to a significant degree via its metabolite, trimethylamine N-oxide. Given the various roles of these two factors in modulating oxidative stress, we also discuss the possible relationship between them and provide future research directions.",

    "abstract": "The biological significance of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) which, in the form of its sulfated ester is the most abundant steroid hormone in human plasma, is an enigma. Over the past years, numerous investigators have reported preclinical findings that DHEA has preventive and therapeutic efficacy in treating major age-associated diseases, including cancer, atherosclerosis, diabetes, obesity, as well as ameliorating the deleterious effects of excess cortisol exposure. Epidemiological studies have also found that low DHEA(S) levels predict an increased all-cause mortality. However, clinical trials, in which oral doses of DHEA at 50 mg-100 mg have been administered to elderly individuals for up to two years, have produced no clear evidence of benefit in parameters such as body composition, peak volume of oxygen consumption, muscle strength, or insulin sensitivity. I discuss why clinical trials, which use doses of DHEA in the 100 mg range, which are the human equivalent of about 1/20<sup>th</sup> the doses used in animal studies, are an inadequate test of DHEA’s therapeutic potential. I also discuss three mechanisms of DHEA action that very likely contribute to its biological effects in animal studies. Lastly, I describe the development of a DHEA analog which lacks DHEA’s androgenic and estrogenic action and that demonstrates enhanced potency and is currently in clinical trials. The use of such analogs may provide a better understanding of DHEA’s potential therapeutic utility.",

However, the function and underlying mechanisms of UPP1 in mediating LUAD cell progression are still largely unknown. Single-cell RNA transcription analysis was applied to compare the expression of UPP1 in tumor tissues and adjacent tissue. In vitro gain- and loss-of-function experiments with LUAD cells were performed to elucidate the functions of UPP1. Western blotting, qRT-PCR, cell apoptosis, IHC staining, Seahorse XF24 Extracellular Flux analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, and bioinformatics analysis were performed to reveal the underlying mechanisms. In this study, UPP1 was found to be the top metabolism-related gene that was upregulated by single-cell transcriptomic profiling of LUAD. Next, we confirmed that UPP1 was highly expressed in LUAD tissues and cell lines and was correlated with poor overall survival in LUAD patients. UPP1 drove glycolytic metabolism and significantly regulated the sensitivity of tumors to glycolytic inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. UPP1 is subject to epigenetic regulation through histone acetylation. The CBP/p300 inhibitor SGC-CBP30 reduced the protein levels of UPP1, H3K27ac, and H3K9ac. ChIP assays revealed that acetyl-histone H3 and RNA polymerase II bind to the UPP1 promoter. UPP1 overexpression restored lactic acid production and glucose uptake compared to the SGC-CBP30 group. Our findings confirm UPP1 as a novel oncogene in LUAD, thus providing a potential novel diagnostic and therapeutic target for LUAD.",

Secondary lesions include intraplaque hemorrhage, plaque rupture, and local thrombosis. Vascular endothelial function impairment and smooth muscle cell migration lead to vascular dysfunction, which is conducive to the formation of macrophage-derived foam cells and aggravates inflammatory response and lipid accumulation that cause atherosclerosis. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) is an epigenetic modifying enzyme closely related to chromatin structure and gene transcriptional regulation. Emerging studies have demonstrated that the Class I member HDAC3 of the HDAC super family has cell-specific functions in atherosclerosis, including 1) maintenance of endothelial integrity and functions, 2) regulation of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, 3) modulation of macrophage phenotype, and 4) influence on foam cell formation. Although several studies have shown that HDAC3 may be a promising therapeutic target, only a few HDAC3-selective inhibitors have been thoroughly researched and reported. Here, we specifically summarize the impact of HDAC3 and its inhibitors on vascular function, inflammation, lipid accumulation, and plaque stability in the development of atherosclerosis with the hopes of opening up new opportunities for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.",

Here, we report hyperactivity with significant inter-individual variability in 4-month-old APP/PS1 mice. Pathological analysis revealed that intraneuronal accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ), c-Fos expression in glutamatergic neurons and activation of astrocytes were more evident in the frontal motor cortex of hyperactive APP/PS1 mice, compared to those with normal activity. Moreover, the hyperactive phenotype was associated with mislocalization of perivascular aquaporin 4 (AQP4) and glymphatic transport impairment. Deletion of the AQP4 gene increased hyperactivity, intraneuronal Aβ load and glutamatergic neuron activation, but did not influence working memory or anxiety-like behaviors of 4-month-old APP/PS1 mice. Together, these results demonstrate that AQP4 mislocalization or deficiency leads to increased intraneuronal Aβ load and neuronal hyperactivity in the motor cortex, which in turn causes locomotor over-activity during the early pathophysiology of APP/PS1 mice. Therefore, improving AQP4 mediated glymphatic clearance may offer a new strategy for early intervention of hyperactivity in the prodromal phase of AD.",

Ferroptosis also interacts with other pathways involved in cell death including iron abnormality, the cystine/glutamate antiporter and lipid peroxidation. Together these pathological pathways exert great impacts on intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), a lethal cerebrovascular disease with a high incidence rate and mortality rate. Furthermore, the ferroptosis also affects different brain cells (neurons and neuroglial cells) and different organelles (mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum). Clinical treatments for ferroptosis in ICH have been closely investigated recently. This perspective provides a comprehensive summary of ferroptosis mechanisms after ICH and its interaction with other cell death patterns. Understanding the role of ferroptosis in ICH will open new windows for the future treatments and preventions for ICH and other intracerebral diseases.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment associated with vascular etiology has been of considerable interest in the development of dementia. Recent studies have started to uncover cerebral blood flow deficits in initiating cognitive deterioration. Brain microvascular pericytes, the only type of contractile cells in capillaries, are involved in the precise modulation of vascular hemodynamics due to their ability to regulate resistance in the capillaries. They exhibit potential in maintaining the capillary network geometry and basal vascular tone. In addition, pericytes can facilitate better blood flow supply in response to neurovascular coupling. Their dysfunction is thought to disturb cerebral blood flow causing metabolic imbalances or structural injuries, leading to consequent cognitive decline. In this review, we summarize the characteristics of microvascular pericytes in brain blood flow regulation and outline the framework of a two-hit hypothesis in cognitive decline, where we emphasize how pericytes serve as targets of cerebral blood flow dysregulation that occurs with neurological challenges, ranging from genetic factors, aging, and pathological proteins to ischemic stress.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades, gut microbiome research has experienced significant growth, driven by technological advances that enable quantifying bacterial taxa with greater precision. Age, diet, and living environment have emerged as three key factors influencing gut microbes. Dysbiosis, resulting from alterations in these factors, may lead to changes in bacterial metabolites that regulate pro- and anti-inflammatory processes and consequently impact bone health. Restoration of a healthy microbiome signature could mitigate inflammation and potentially reduce bone loss associated with osteoporosis or experienced by astronauts during spaceflight. However, current research is hindered by contradictory findings, insufficient sample sizes, and inconsistency in experimental conditions and controls. Despite progress in sequencing technology, defining a healthy gut microbiome across global populations remains elusive. Challenges persist in identifying accurate gut bacterial metabolics, specific taxa, and their effects on host physiology. We suggest greater attention be directed towards this issue in Western countries as the cost of treating osteoporosis in the United States reaches billions of dollars annually, with expenses projected to continue rising.",

    "abstract": "Chronic pain is a notable health concern because of its prevalence, persistence, and associated mental stress. Drugs targeting chronic pain with potent abirritation, and minimal side effects remain unidentified. Substantial evidence indicates that the Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway plays a distinct and critical role in different stages of chronic pain. Aberrant activation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway is evident in multiple chronic pain models. Moreover, an increasing number of studies have demonstrated that the downregulation of JAK2/STAT3 can attenuate chronic pain in different animal models. In this review, we investigated the mechanism and role of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in modulating chronic pain. The aberrant activation of JAK2/STAT3 can trigger chronic pain by interacting with microglia and astrocytes, releasing proinflammatory cytokines, inhibiting anti-inflammatory cytokines, and regulating synaptic plasticity. We also retrospectively reviewed current reports on JAK2/STAT3 pharmacological inhibitors that demonstrated their significant therapeutic potential in different types of chronic pain. In summary, our results provide strong evidence that the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway is a promising therapeutic target for chronic pain.",

    "abstract": "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) has recently attracted much attention due to its role in aging and lifespan extension. NAD<sup>+</sup> directly and indirectly affects many cellular processes, including metabolic pathways, DNA repair, and immune cell activities. These mechanisms are critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis. However, the decline in NAD<sup>+</sup> levels with aging impairs tissue function, which has been associated with several age-related diseases. In fact, the aging population has been steadily increasing worldwide, and it is important to restore NAD<sup>+</sup> levels and reverse or delay these age-related disorders. Therefore, there is an increasing demand for healthy products that can mitigate aging, extend lifespan, and halt age-related consequences. In this case, several studies in humans and animals have targeted NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism with NAD<sup>+</sup> intermediates. Among them, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a precursor in the biosynthesis of NAD<sup>+</sup>, has recently received much attention from the scientific community for its anti-aging properties. In model organisms, ingestion of NMN has been shown to improve age-related diseases and probably delay death. Here, we review aspects of NMN biosynthesis and the mechanism of its absorption, as well as potential anti-aging mechanisms of NMN, including recent preclinical and clinical tests, adverse effects, limitations, and perceived challenges.",

Although physical exercise has been shown to have a positive influence on these factors, the effect of resistance exercise on them is not well known. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to 1) estimate the efficacy of resistance exercise on major neuroprotective factors, such as insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), in middle and late life and 2) determine whether the effect is dose dependent. A systematic search was conducted in CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Scopus, PEDro, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science up to November 2022. Random effects models were used to estimate standardized mean differences (SMDs) and their respective 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the effect of resistance exercise on peripheral IGF-1, BDNF or VEGF levels in older adults. Thirty randomized clinical trials with 1247 subjects (53.25% women, 45-92 years) were included in the systematic review, and 27 were selected for the meta-analysis. A significant effect of resistance exercise on IGF-1 levels was observed (SMD: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.69), being more effective when performing 3 sessions/week (SMD: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.31, 0.79) but not on BDNF (SMD: 0.33; 95% CI: -0.29, 0.94). The effect on VEGF could not be determined due to the scarcity of studies. Our data support the resistance training recommendation in middle and late life, at a frequency of at least 3 sessions/week, to mitigate the neurological and cognitive consequences associated with aging, mainly through IGF-1.",

    "abstract": "The gut-brain axis is a communication channel that mediates a complex interplay of intestinal flora with the neural, endocrine, and immune systems, linking gut and brain functions. Gut metabolites, a group of small molecules produced or consumed by biochemical processes in the gut, are involved in central nervous system regulation via the highly interconnected gut-brain axis affecting microglia indirectly by influencing the structure of the gut-brain axis or directly affecting microglia function and activity. Accordingly, pathological changes in the central nervous system are connected with changes in intestinal metabolite levels as well as altered microglia function and activity, which may contribute to the pathological process of each neuroinflammatory condition. Here, we discuss the mechanisms by which gut metabolites, for instance, the bile acids, short-chain fatty acids, and tryptophan metabolites, regulate the structure of each component of the gut-brain axis, and explore the important roles of gut metabolites in the central nervous system from the perspective of microglia. At the same time, we highlight the roles of gut metabolites affecting microglia in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and neurodevelopmental disorders. Understanding the relationship between microglia, gut microbiota, neuroinflammation, and neurodevelopmental disorders will help us identify new strategies for treating neuropsychiatric disorders.",

Moreover, the biological process of aging is the most significant risk factor for most chronic illnesses; therefore, understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these aging-related challenges is crucial for extending the healthy lifespan of older individuals. Preventing brain aging remains a priority public health goal, and integrative and comprehensive aging analyses have revealed that immunosenescence is a potential cause of age-related brain damage and disease (e.g., stroke). Importantly, the neuroinflammatory and immune systems present two-way contact and thus can affect each other. Emerging evidence supports the numerous effects of immunosenescence- and inflammation-mediated immunity in neurologically injured brains. In this study, we briefly outline how aging alters the pathophysiology and transcriptional amplitude in patients who experienced stroke and then discuss how the immune system and its cellular components and molecular mechanisms are affected by age after stroke.

    "abstract": "Cellular aging is associated with dysfunction of numerous tissues affecting multiple organ systems. A striking example of this is related to age-related bone loss, or osteoporosis, increasing fracture incidence. Interestingly, the two compartments of bone, cortical and cancellous or trabecular, rely on different mechanisms for development and maintenance during 'normal' aging. At a cellular level, the aging process disturbs a multitude of intracellular pathways. In particular, alterations in cellular metabolic functions thereby impacting cellular bioenergetics have been implicated in multiple tissues. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize how metabolic processes were altered in bone forming osteoblasts in aged mice compared to young mice. Metabolic flux analyses demonstrated both stromal cells and mature, matrix secreting osteoblasts from aged mice exhibited mitochondrial dysfunction. This was also accompanied by a lack of adaptability or metabolic flexibility to utilize exogenous substrates compared to osteoblasts cultured from young mice. Additionally, lipid droplets accumulated in both early stromal cells and mature osteoblasts from aged mice, which was further depicted as increased lipid content within the bone cortex of aged mice. Global transcriptomic analysis of the bone further supported these metabolic data as enhanced oxidative stress genes were up-regulated in aged mice, while osteoblast-related genes were down-regulated when compared to the young mice. Collectively, these data suggest that aging results in altered osteoblast metabolic handling of both exogenous and endogenous substrates which could contribute to age-related osteoporosis.",

We observed in our murine model a premature aging by the appearance of senescent cells in the lungs after 21 d of influenza A virus infection. By using murine ex vivo lung models, the influence of TNF-α on the establishment of cellular senescence was detectable. Our findings were proven by using conditioned media of infected human monocyte-derived macrophages on primary lung fibroblasts. Here, a distinct expression of senescence-associated parameters could be confirmed. Furthermore, senescent cells in the lungs strongly influenced subsequent viral infections. Our data demonstrated a higher viral load in senescent primary lung fibroblasts, indicating an intracellular effect on viral replication. Transcriptomic data revealed an increased regulation of JAK/STAT signaling in senescent IAV-infected cells accompanied with increased TRAIL expression. Additionally, senescent cells indicating low pH values, accelerating viral replication. Our study provides new insights into pathomechanisms of virus-induced cellular senescence.

High-resolution 2D/3D gradient echo MRI at 7T enhanced with Ferumoxytol, an ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO), was obtained and analyzed for cerebral small medullary artery tortuosity from 37 healthy participants (21-70 years; mean/SD: 38±14 years; 19 females). Tortuous artery count and tortuosity indices were compared between young and old groups. Age effects on vascular tortuosity were examined through partial correlations and multiple linear regression, adjusting for sex, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), and other vascular risk factors. Associations between tortuous medullary arteries and tissue atrophy, perivascular spaces (PVS), and white matter (WM) hyperintensities were explored. Age and BMI, rather than BP, showed positive correlations with both tortuous artery count and tortuosity indices. A significant correlation existed between the number of tortuous arteries and WM atrophy. WM lesions were found in proximity to or at the distal ends of tortuous medullary arteries, especially within the deep WM. Moreover, the elderly population displayed a higher prevalence of PVS, including those containing enclosed tortuous arteries. Leveraging the blooming effect of Ferumoxytol, 7T MRI excels in directly detecting cerebral small arterial tortuosity in vivo, unveiling its associations with age, BMI, tissue atrophy, WMH and PVS.",

    "abstract": "Increased endothelial permeability plays an important role in blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction and is implicated in neuronal injury in many diseased conditions. BBB disruption is primarily determined by dysfunction of endothelial cell-cell junctions. Deprivation of oxygen supply or hypoxia, a common feature of a variety of human diseases, is a major risk factor for BBB disruption. The molecular regulatory mechanisms of hypoxia-induced BBB dysfunction remain incompletely understood. The mitochondrial enzyme, arginase type II (Arg-II), has been shown to promote endothelial dysfunction. However, its role in hypoxia-induced BBB dysfunction has not been explored. In the C57BL/6J mouse model, hypoxia (8% O<sub>2</sub>, 24 hours) augments vascular Arg-II in the hippocampus, decreases cell-cell junction protein levels of Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), occludin, and CD31 in endothelial cells, increases BBB leakage in the brain in old mice (20 to 24 months) but not in young animals (3 to 6 months). These effects of hypoxia in aging are suppressed in <i>arg-ii<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice. Moreover, the age-associated vulnerability of endothelial integrity to hypoxia is demonstrated in senescent human brain microvascular endothelial cell (hCMEC/D3) culture model. Further results in the cell culture model show that hypoxia augments Arg-II, decreases ZO-1 and occludin levels, and increases endothelial permeability, which is prevented by <i>arg-ii</i> gene silencing or by inhibition of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) production. Our study demonstrates an essential role of Arg-II in increased endothelial permeability and BBB dysfunction by promoting mtROS generation, resulting in decreased endothelial cell-cell junction protein levels under hypoxic conditions particularly in aging.",

To maximize the effectiveness and design of NMs-based medical applications, it is essential to comprehend the complex mechanisms of cellular uptake, subcellular localization, and cellular retention. This review illuminates the various pathways that NMs take to get from the extracellular environment to certain intracellular compartments by investigating the various mechanisms that underlie their interaction with cells. The cellular uptake of NMs involves complex interactions with cell membranes, encompassing endocytosis, phagocytosis, and other active transport mechanisms. Unique uptake patterns across cell types highlight the necessity for customized NMs designs. After internalization, NMs move through a variety of intracellular routes that affect where they are located subcellularly. Understanding these pathways is pivotal for enhancing the targeted delivery of therapeutic agents and imaging probes. Furthermore, the cellular retention of NMs plays a critical role in sustained therapeutic efficacy and long-term imaging capabilities. Factors influencing cellular retention include nanoparticle size, surface chemistry, and the cellular microenvironment. Strategies for prolonging cellular retention are discussed, including surface modifications and encapsulation techniques. In conclusion, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms governing cellular uptake, subcellular localization, and cellular retention of NMs is essential for advancing their application in disease diagnosis and therapy. This review provides insights into the intricate interplay between NMs and biological systems, offering a foundation for the rational design of next-generation nanomedicines.",

Currently, the pathogenesis of DOR is largely unknown, and the efficacy of existing therapeutic methods is limited. Therefore, in-depth exploration of the mechanism underlying DOR is highly important for identifying molecular therapeutic targets for DOR. Our study showed that estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) mRNA and protein expression was upregulated in granulosa cells (GCs) from patients with DOR and in the ovaries of DOR model mice. Mechanistically, elevated ERβ promotes forkhead transcription factor family 3a (FOXO3a) expression, which contributes to autophagic activation in GCs. Activation of FOXO3a/autophagy signalling leads to decreased cell proliferation and increased cell apoptosis and ultimately leads to DOR. In a cyclophosphamide (Cy)-induced DOR mouse model, treatment with PHTPP, a selective ERβ antagonist, rescued fertility by restoring normal sex hormone secretion, estrus cycle duration, follicle development, oocyte quality and litter size. Taken together, these findings reveal a pathological mechanism of DOR based on ERβ overexpression and identify PHTPP as a potential therapeutic agent for DOR.",

    "abstract": "In the central nervous system, oligodendrocytes wrap around neuronal axons to form myelin, an insulating layer or sheath that allows for the efficient conductance of action potentials. In addition to structural insulation, myelin provides encased axons with nutrient, metabolic and defensive support. Demyelination, or myelin loss, can therefore cause axonal dysfunction, leading to neurological impairment and disease. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), progressive white matter demyelination is acknowledged as one of the earliest pathologies preceding symptom onset. Unfortunately, current pharmacotherapy for slowing demyelination or promoting remyelination in AD is nonexistent. Exercise is recognized for its wide-ranging benefits to human health, including improved mental health and the prevention of lifestyle-related diseases. Mounting evidence suggests the contribution of physical activity in delaying the progression of dementia in elderly populations. Recent mechanistic studies have shown that exercise facilitates myelination in the brain through the vitalization of intrinsic pro-myelination cues, such as increased neurotrophic factors and electrical activity. In this review, we summarize and discuss the potential of physical exercise on counteracting aging-associated white matter demyelination, which causes cognitive decline in AD. We highlight the need of further basic and clinical research investigations on this topic to establish novel approaches for healthy and improved brain aging.",

This perspective elucidates the functions of circadian rhythms in the TME across various stages of cancer development, progression, and metastasis. Specifically, aging, angiogenesis, and inflammation are implicated in modulating circadian rhythm within the TME. Furthermore, circadian rhythm exerts a profound influence on current cancer treatments and thereby generates chronotheray to manage tumors.

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a pivotal role in the development of age-related diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders. The etiology of mitochondrial dysfunction involves a multitude of factors that remain elusive. This review centers on elucidating the role(s) of excitotoxicity, oxytosis/ferroptosis and neurodegeneration within the context of mitochondrial bioenergetics, biogenesis, mitophagy and oxidative stress and explores their intricate interplay in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. The effective coordination of mitochondrial turnover processes, notably mitophagy and biogenesis, is assumed to be critically important for cellular resilience and longevity. However, the age-associated decrease in mitophagy impedes the elimination of dysfunctional mitochondria, consequently impairing mitochondrial biogenesis. This deleterious cascade results in the accumulation of damaged mitochondria and deterioration of cellular functions. Both excitotoxicity and oxytosis/ferroptosis have been demonstrated to contribute significantly to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's Disease (HD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Excitotoxicity, characterized by excessive glutamate signaling, initiates a cascade of events involving calcium dysregulation, energy depletion, and oxidative stress and is intricately linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, emerging concepts surrounding oxytosis/ferroptosis underscore the importance of iron-dependent lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial engagement in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration. This review not only discusses the individual contributions of excitotoxicity and ferroptosis but also emphasizes their convergence with mitochondrial dysfunction, a key driver of neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding the intricate crosstalk between excitotoxicity, oxytosis/ferroptosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction holds potential to pave the way for mitochondrion-targeted therapeutic strategies. Such strategies, with a focus on bioenergetics, biogenesis, mitophagy, and oxidative stress, emerge as promising avenues for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Recent genome- and exome-wide association studies suggest that the human <i>APOE ε4</i> allele protects against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), while <i>ε3</i> promotes hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis. The present study aimed at examining the <i>APOE</i> genotype-dependent development of fatty liver disease and its underlying mechanisms in a targeted replacement mouse model. Male mice expressing the human APOE3 or APOE4 protein isoforms on a C57BL/6J background and unmodified C57BL/6J mice were chronically fed a high-fat and high-sucrose diet to induce obesity. After 7 months, body weight gain was more pronounced in human APOE than endogenous APOE expressing mice with elevated plasma biomarkers suggesting aggravated metabolic dysfunction. APOE3 mice exhibited the highest liver weights and, compared to APOE4, massive hepatic steatosis. An untargeted quantitative proteome analysis of the liver identified a high number of proteins differentially abundant in APOE3 versus APOE4 mice. The majority of the higher abundant proteins in APOE3 mice could be grouped to inflammation and damage-associated response, and lipid storage, amongst others. Results of the targeted qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses contribute to the overall finding that APOE3 as opposed to APOE4 promotes hepatic steatosis, inflammatory- and damage-associated response signaling and fibrosis in the liver of obese mice. Our experimental data substantiate the observation of an increased NAFLD-risk associated with the human <i>APOEε3</i> allele, while <i>APOEε4</i> appears protective. The underlying mechanisms of the protection possibly involve a higher capacity of nonectopic lipid deposition in subcutaneous adipose tissue and lower hepatic pathogen recognition in the APOE4 mice.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic wounds represent a formidable challenge in the clinical management of diabetes mellitus, markedly diminishing the patient's quality of life. These wounds arise from a multifaceted etiology, with the pathophysiological underpinnings remaining elusive and complex. Diabetes precipitates neuropathies and vasculopathies in the lower extremities, culminating in infections, ulcerations, and extensive tissue damage. The hallmarks of non-healing diabetic wounds include senescence, persistent inflammation, heightened apoptosis, and attenuated cellular proliferation. The TP53 gene, a pivotal tumor suppressor frequently silenced in human malignancies, orchestrates cellular proliferation, senescence, DNA repair, and apoptosis. While p53 is integral in cell cycle regulation, its role in initial tissue repair appears to be deleterious. In typical cutaneous wounds, p53 levels transiently dip, swiftly reverting to baseline. Yet in diabetic wounds, protracted p53 activation impedes healing via two distinct pathways: i) activating the p53-p21-Retinoblastoma (RB) axis, which halts the cell cycle, and ii) upregulating the cGAS-STING and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) cascades, instigating ferroptosis and pyroptosis. Furthermore, p53 intersects with various metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and autophagy. In diabetic wounds, p53 may drive metabolic reprogramming, thus potentially derailing macrophage polarization. This review synthesizes case studies investigating the therapeutic modulation of p53 in diabetic wounds care. In summation, p53 modulates chronic inflammation and cellular aging within diabetic cutaneous wounds and is implicated in a novel cell death modality, encompassing ferroptosis and pyroptosis, which hinders the reparative process.",

Within the unified framework of the ANT, the introduction of B (the disruption of the blood-brain barrier) facilitates communication between the brain and the periphery through the blood-brain barrier.

This hypothesis involves the abnormal activation of microglia, the release of inflammatory mediators, and damage to astrocytes, which leads to blood-brain barrier impairment and subsequently triggers systemic inflammation. Bone health is associated with conditions such as osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and periodontitis.

    "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness in the elderly. Aging is the most important risk factor for AMD, and the aging immune system seems to be involved in pathogenesis. This study investigates the systemic aging immune profile in relation to AMD stage and treatment response. Treatment-naïve patients with neovascular AMD (nAMD), intermediate AMD and healthy controls were included in this prospective study. Participants were examined for systemic aging immune profiles and compared to AMD stage, as well as initial and one-year treatment response in nAMD patients. Flowcytometry was performed to determine T cell differentiation (naïve, central memory and effector memory) and expression of costimulatory markers (CD27, CD28, CD56). Cytokine assays were performed to measure the concentrations of plasma cytokines IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17, IL-22, IL-27, TNF-α. Polymorphisms of CFH and ARMS2 genes were compared in nAMD patients. Patients with nAMD had significantly higher proportions of central and effector memory CD8+ T cells compared to controls (both P &;lt 0.036). nAMD patients had significantly elevated concentrations of IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-2, and IL-10 (all P &;lt 0.05). nAMD patients with poor initial treatment response had a significantly higher concentration of plasma IFN-γ compared to good responders (P =0.026). Patients with nAMD had a more advanced systemic aging immune profile with higher levels of T cell differentiation and plasma cytokines compared to controls. Poor initial response had elevated levels of plasma IFN-γ compared to good responders in nAMD.",

    "abstract": "The aging process significantly contributes to human disease, and as worldwide life expectancy increases, addressing the challenges of aging and age-related cardiovascular diseases is becoming increasingly urgent. Vascular aging is a key link between aging and the development of age-related diseases. Recent studies indicate that proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a type of protein involved in the metabolism of lipids, is crucial in modulating vascular aging by affecting the physiological functioning of vascular cells. PCSK9 is linked to lipid metabolism and chronic inflammation and is involved in regulating senescence-related activities, including migration, proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. These factors contribute to the aging of vascular cells and age-related vascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular diseases. Given its involvement in these processes, this article provides a comprehensive summary of PCSK9's regulatory functions in vascular aging, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for combating age-related cardiovascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) represents a vast repository of therapeutic knowledge, but its integration with modern drug discovery remains challenging due to fundamental differences in theoretical frameworks. We developed an AI agent-driven framework combining Precious3GPT (P3GPT), a multi-omics transformer model, with the BATMAN-TCM2 database of TCM compound-target interactions to bridge this gap. As a proof-of-concept, we used P3GPT-generated cross-species and cross-tissue signatures to screen TCM compounds, herbs, and formulas to identify novel natural geroprotectors. The cross-species analysis identified 13 conserved aging-associated genes, leading to the identification of 34 TCM compounds with significant target overlap and enabling identification of HUA SHAN WU ZI DAN and other TCM formulations as a promising historical formula. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of using AI to systematically bridge TCM and modern pharmacology, enabling rational design of multi-component formulations targeting age-related processes across multiple tissues and species. This approach provides a framework for modernizing traditional medicine while maintaining its holistic therapeutic principles. To help other teams integrate AI experimentation in their research process, we publicly release all materials and codebase used in this work, including the multi-agent system, cross-species and cross-tissue signatures of aging, as well as TCM databases formatted for AI interactions.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenic obesity (SO), a geriatric syndrome characterized by the coexistence of progressive skeletal muscle atrophy and excessive adipose tissue accumulation, represents a growing public health challenge associated with aging populations. While multifactorial pathogenesis involves chronic inflammation, hormonal changes, and mitochondrial dysfunction, sedentary lifestyles and aging remain primary modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors, respectively. Mechanistically, exercise exerts dual therapeutic effects: (1) hypertrophy of type II muscle fibers through IGF-1/Akt/mTORC1 signaling activation, and (2) enhanced lipid β-oxidation via AMPK/PGC1α axis stimulation, thereby mitigating both sarcopenia and adiposity. The autophagy-lysosome system, a conserved cellular quality-control mechanism, orchestrates organelle turnover and nutrient recycling through three distinct pathways: macroautophagic, chaperone-mediated autophagy, and mitophagy. In SO, impaired proteolytic and lipolytic processes converge to induce autophagic flux blockade, manifested by accumulated p62/SQSTM1 and reduced LC3-II/LC3-I ratio. Targeting the AMPK/mTOR signaling nexus, which senses cellular energy status, emerges as a strategic intervention. Exercise-mediated ATP depletion activates AMPK while suppressing mTORC1, thereby synchronously inducing autophagy initiation (ULK1 phosphorylation) and lysosomal biogenesis (TFEB nuclear translocation). This metabolic reprogramming ultimately restores proteostasis and lipid homeostasis in myocytes and adipocytes.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing scientific agreement that the cellular redox regulators such as antioxidants, particularly the natural polyphenolic forms, may help lower the incidence of some pathologies, including metabolic diseases like diabetes and diabesity, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative abnormalities, and certain cancers or even have anti-aging properties. The recent researches indicate that the degree of metabolic modulation and adaptation response of cells to reductants as well as oxidants establish their survival and homeostasis, which is linked with very critical balance in imbalances in cellular redox capacity and signaling, and that might be an answer the questions why some antioxidants or phytochemicals potentially could do more harm than good, or why some proteins lose their function by increase interactions with glyco- and lipo-oxidation mediates in the cells (carbonyl stress). Nonetheless, pursue of healthy aging has led the use of antioxidants as a means to disrupt age-associated physiological dysfunctions, dysregulated metabolic processes or prevention of many age-related diseases. Although it is still early to define their exact clinical benefits for treating age-related disease, a diet rich in polyphenolic or other forms of antioxidants does seem to offer hope in delaying the onset of age-related disorders. It is now clear that any deficiency in antioxidant vitamins, inadequate enzymatic antioxidant defenses can distinctive for many age-related disease, and protein carbonylation can used as an indicator of oxidative stress associated diseases and aging status. This review examines antioxidant compounds and plant polyphenols as redox regulators in health, disease and aging processes with hope that a better understanding of the many mechanisms involved with these distinct compounds, which may lead to better health and novel treatment approaches for age-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "This manuscript is a review of the theoretical and clinical concepts provided during an inter-institutional training program on Activity-Based Restorative Therapies (ABRT) and the perceptions of those in attendance. ABRT is a relatively recent high volume and intensity approach toward the restoration of neurological deficits and decreasing the risk of secondary conditions associated with paralysis after spinal cord injury (SCI). ABRT is guided by the principle of neuroplasticity and the belief that even those with chronic SCI can benefit from repeated activation of the spinal cord pathways located both above and below the level of injury. ABRT can be defined as repetitive-task specific training using weight-bearing and external facilitation of neuromuscular activation. The five key components of ABRT are weight-bearing activities, functional electrical stimulation, task-specific practice, massed practice and locomotor training which includes body weight supported treadmill walking and water treadmill training. The various components of ABRT have been shown to improve functional mobility, and reverse negative body composition changes after SCI leading to the reduction of cardiovascular and other metabolic disease risk factors. The consensus of those who received the ABRT training was that ABRT has much potential for enhancement of recovery of those with SCI. Although various institutions have their own strengths and challenges, each institution was able to initiate a modified ABRT program.",

    "abstract": "Unperturbed fetal development is essential for future health of an individual. Previous studies have linked diseases of aging to harmful alterations that happen during fetal development. Given the significant long-term impact that intrauterine environment has on an individual's life, it was hypothesized that maternal stress during pregnancy will have negative effects on the offspring's prenatal and postnatal growth. To test this, twenty-eight female and seven male Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus) were purchased and bred to produce 176 offspring. During pregnancy, dams were randomly divided into four groups (n=7, per group) and immobilization stress induced as follows; Group 1 (GW1): immobilization stress on days 1-7 of pregnancy, Group 2 (GW2): on days 8-14, Group 3 (GW3): on days 15-21, Group 4 (Controls): left undisturbed. Maternal cortisol hormone, food intake, and weight gain were monitored during pregnancy. Pups were raised under normal laboratory conditions and sacrificed at ages: 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks to determine the effect of prenatal stress. At necropsy, the tibia was removed and processed for histology. Differences among groups were determined by T-test or analysis of variance (ANOVA). Linear regression analysis was performed to establish the relationship between stress in utero and indicators of bone development in offspring. P values ≤ 0.05 were considered significant. Cortisol hormone levels in controls were lower than those of stressed animals. Stressed dams consumed 12.5% less food per day compared to controls. Animals in GW1 and GW2 gained less weight during pregnancy but had larger litters than did GW3 or the control group. Offspring born to GW3 were heavier compared to all other groups. GW3 offspring had a higher rate of bone formation. In conclusion, stress during pregnancy resulted in increased cortisol and reduced food intake in mothers, but faster growth and higher weight gain in offspring compared to controls.",

Frozen serum samples from the Oregon Tissue Bank were used to measure serum levels of hepcidin, ferritin, Aβ40, Aβ42 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum transferrin levels were determined indirectly as total iron binding capacity, serum iron was measured and the percent saturation of transferrin calculated. The study variables were correlated with the patients' existing cognitive assessment tests, neuroimaging, and clinical data. Hepcidin, and iron-related proteins tended to be higher in AD patients than controls, reaching statistical significance for ferritin, whereas Aβ40, Aβ42 serum levels tended to be lower. Patients with pure AD had three times higher serum hepcidin levels than controls; gender differences in hepcidin and iron-related proteins were observed. Patient stratification based on clinical dementia rating-sum of boxes revealed significantly higher levels of iron and iron-related proteins in AD patients in the upper 50% as compared to controls, suggesting that iron dyshomeostasis worsens as cognitive impairment increases. Unlike Aβ peptides, iron and iron-related proteins showed significant association with cognitive assessment tests, neuroimaging, and clinical data. Hepcidin and iron-related proteins comprise a group of serum biomarkers that relate to AD diagnosis and AD disease progression. Future studies should determine whether strategies targeted to diminishing hepcidin synthesis/secretion and improving iron homeostasis could have a beneficial impact on AD progression.",

Here, we investigated whether LRIC promoted myelin growth by activating PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal pathway in a rat chronic hypoperfusion model. Thirty adult male Sprague Dawley underwent permanent double carotid artery (2VO), and limb remote ischemic conditioning was applied for 3 days after the 2VO surgery. Cognitive function, oligodendrocyte counts, myelin density, apoptosis and proliferation activity, as well as PTEN/Akt/mTOR signaling activity were determined 4 weeks after treatment. We found that LRIC significantly inhibited oligodendrocytes apoptosis (p<0.05), promoted myelination (p<0.01) in the corpus callosum and improved spatial learning impairment (p<0.05) at 4 weeks after chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. Oligodendrocytes proliferation, along with demyelination, in corpus callosum were not obviously affected by LRIC (p>0.05). Western blot analysis indicated that LRIC upregulated PTEN/Akt/mTOR signaling activities in corpus callosum (p<0.05). Our results suggest that LRIC exerts neuroprotective effect on white matter injuries through activating PTEN/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway after chronic cerebral hypoperfusion.",

    "abstract": "Reversible regulation of proteins by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is an important mechanism of neuronal plasticity. In particular, ROS have been shown to act as modulatory molecules of ion channels—which are key to neuronal excitability—in several physiological processes. However ROS are also fundamental contributors to aging vulnerability. When the level of excess ROS increases in the cell during aging, DNA is damaged, proteins are oxidized, lipids are degraded and more ROS are produced, all culminating in significant cell injury. From this arose the idea that oxidation of ion channels by ROS is one of the culprits for neuronal aging. Aging-dependent oxidative modification of voltage-gated potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) channels was initially demonstrated in the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and more recently in the mammalian brain. Specifically, oxidation of the delayed rectifier KCNB1 (Kv2.1) and of Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and voltage sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channels have been established suggesting that their redox sensitivity contributes to altered excitability, progression of healthy aging and of neurodegenerative disease. Here I discuss the implications that oxidation of K<sup>+</sup> channels by ROS may have for normal aging, as well as for neurodegenerative disease.",

Here, we explored the structure of vasculature at the whole-brain level using the newly developed CLARITY technique. Adult male C57BL/6J mice undergoing transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and Tie2-RFP transgenic mice were used. Whole mouse brains were extracted for CLARITY processing. Immunostaining was performed to label vessels. Customized MATLAB code was used for image processing and quantification. Three-dimensional images were visualized using the Vaa3D software. Our results showed that whole mouse brain became transparent using the CLARITY method. Three-dimensional imaging and visualization of vasculature were achieved at the whole-brain level with a 1-μm voxel resolution. The quantitative results showed that the fractional vascular volume was 0.018 ± 0.004 mm<sup>3</sup> per mm<sup>3</sup>, the normalized vascular length was 0.44 ± 0.04 m per mm<sup>3</sup>, and the mean diameter of the microvessels was 4.25 ± 0.08 μm. Furthermore, a decrease in the fractional vascular volume and a decrease in the normalized vascular length were found in the penumbra of ischemic mice compared to controls (<i>p</i> < 0.05). In conclusion, CLARITY provides a novel approach for mapping vasculature in the whole mouse brain at cellular resolution.

One-year mortality of the early and the late readmission groups was 44.9% and 32.3%, much higher than overall mortality which was 16.8%. Predictive factors for readmission within 1 year included male, old age, comorbidities, and longer hospital stay. One-year mortality in readmitted patients was significantly higher.

However, whether they can be used as reliable predictors to evaluate the severity and progression of PDD and VPD remains largely unknown.We performed a cross-sectional study that included 92 patients with PDD, 82 patients with VPD and 80 healthy controls. Serum levels of TFF3, ChE activity and Hcy were measured. Several scales were used to rate the severity of PDD and VPD. Receivers operating characteristic (ROC) curves were applied to map the diagnostic accuracy of PDD and VPD patients compared to healthy subjects.Compared with healthy subjects, the serum levels of TFF3 and ChE activity were lower, while Hcy was higher in the PDD and VPD patients. These findings were especially prominent in male patients. The three biomarkers displayed differences between PDD and VPD sub-groups based on genders and UPDRS (III) scores' distribution. Interestingly, these increased serum Hcy levels were significantly and inversely correlated with decreased TFF3/ChE activity levels. There were significant correlations between TFF3/ChE activity/Hcy levels and PDD/VPD severities, including motor dysfunction, declining cognition and mood/gastrointestinal symptoms. Additionally, ROC curves for the combination of TFF3, ChE activity and Hcy showed potential diagnostic value in discriminating PDD and VPD patients from healthy controls.Our findings suggest that serum TFF3, ChE activity and Hcy levels may underlie the pathophysiological mechanisms of PDD and VPD.

    "abstract": "Stroke occurs mostly in patients with advanced age. Elderly patients have a less favorable prognosis compared with young adult patients. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we tested our hypothesis that an increased inflammatory response to acute ischemic injury in old stroke mice leads to more severe brain damage and behavioral dysfunction. An ischemic stroke model was created in 2- and 12-month-old C57BL/6 mice through permanent occlusion of the left distal middle cerebral artery (dMCAO). Infarct/atrophy volumes were quantified by staining the brain sections with Cresyl Violet. Sensorimotor function was assessed using the corner test and adhesive removal test. Quantification of CD68<sup>+</sup> cells in the peri-infarct region was performed at 1, 3 and 14 days after dMCAO. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 β (IL-1β) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in the ischemic brain tissue were measured using ELISA. Western blot was used to determine the expression levels of tight junction proteins, claudin-5 and zonula occludens (ZO)-1. Blood-brain barrier permeability was measured by Evans blue (EB) extravasation. Gelatinase B (MMP-9, type IV collagenase) was measured by gel zymography. Compared to 2-month-old mice, 12-month-old mice had more severe behavioral deficits at both the acute and chronic stages of stroke. Compared with the 2-month-old mice, 12-month-old mice had larger infarct/atrophy volumes at 1 and 14 days after dMCAO, higher levels of IL-6 and IL-1β, higher MMP9 activity, and lower levels of claudin-5 and ZO-1 at 1 and 3 days after dMCAO. 12-month-old mice also had more CD68<sup>+</sup> cells in the peri-infarct region at 1, 3 and 14 days after dMCAO and more EB leakage at 3 days after dMCAO. A higher inflammatory response at the acute stage of ischemic stroke in old mice is associated with more severe neuronal injury and long-term behavioral dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "It has been reported that aquaporin-4 (AQP4) deficiency impairs transportation between the cerebrospinal fluid and interstitial fluid (ISF) as well as the clearance of interstitial solutes in the superficial brain. However, the effect of AQP4 on ISF flow in the deep brain remains unclear. This study compared the brain ISF flow in the caudate nucleus and thalamus of normal rats (NO) and AQP4 knockout rats (KO) using tracer-based magnetic resonance imaging. The rate of brain ISF flow slowed to different degrees in the two regions of KO rats' brains. Compared with NO rats, the half-life of ISF in the thalamus of KO rats was significantly prolonged, with a corresponding decrease in the clearance coefficient. The tortuosity of the brain extracellular space (ECS) was unchanged in the thalamus of KO rats. In the caudate nucleus of KO rats, the volume fraction of the ECS and the diffusion coefficient were increased, with significantly decreased tortuosity; no significant changes in brain ISF flow were demonstrated. Combined with a change in the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein and AQP4 in two brain regions, we found that the effect of AQP4 knockout on ISF flow and ECS structure in these two regions differed. This difference may be related to the distribution of astrocytes and the extent of AQP4 decline. This study provides evidence for the involvement of AQP4 in ISF transportation in the deep brain and provides a basis for the establishment of a pharmacokinetic model of the brain's interstitial pathway.",

    "abstract": "Muscle power is a strong predictor of functional status in the elderly population and is required to perform different daily activities. To compare the effects of different weekly training frequencies on muscle power and muscle quality induced by concurrent training (resistance + aerobic) in previously trained elderly men. Twenty-four trained elderly men (65 ± 4 years), previously engaged in a regular concurrent training program, three times per week, for the previous five months, were randomly allocated to concurrent training programs in which training was performed either twice a week (2·week-1, n = 12) or three times per week (3·week-1, n = 12). The groups trained with an identical exercise intensity and volume per session for 10 weeks. Before and after the exercise training, we examined muscle power, as estimated by countermovement jump height; knee extensor isokinetic peak torque at 60 and 180o.s-1; and muscle quality, a quotient between the one-repetition maximum of the knee extensors and the sum of quadriceps femoris muscle thickness determined by ultrasonography. Additionally, as secondary outcomes, blood pressure and reactive hyperemia were evaluated. Two-way ANOVA with repeated measures were used and statistical significance was set at α = 0.05. Muscular power (2·week-1: 7%, and 3·week-1: 10%) and muscle quality (2·week-1: 15%, and 3·week-1: 8%) improved with the concurrent exercise training (p < 0.001) but with no differences between groups. The isokinetic peak torque at 60 (2·week-1: 4%, and 3·week-1: 2%) and 180o.s-1 (2·week-1: 7%, and 3·week-1: 1%) increased in both groups (p = 0.036 and p=0.014, respectively). There were no changes in blood pressure or reactive hyperemia with the concurrent training. Concurrent training performed twice a week promotes similar adaptations in muscular power and muscle quality when compared with the same program performed three times per week in previously trained elderly men.",

Even though the prevalence of AD is continuously increasing, few drugs including cholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl D-aspartate-receptor antagonists were approved to treat AD. Because the clinical trials of AD drugs with single targets, such as β-amyloid and tau, have failed, the development of multi-target drugs that ameliorate many of the symptoms of AD is needed. Thus, recent studies have investigated the effects and underlying mechanisms of herbal formulae consisting of various herb combinations used to treat AD.

    "abstract": "There is a growing number of elderly kidney transplant (Ktx) recipients. Elderly recipients present lower acute rejection rates but higher incidence of infection and malignancies. Aging per se seems to result in a shift to memory profile and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in premature immunological aging. Understanding aging and CKD effects on the immune system can improve elderly Ktx immunosuppression. We analyzed the effects of aging and CKD in the immune system, comparing healthy adults (HAd) (n=14, 26±2y), healthy elderly (HEld) (n=15, 79±7y), end stage renal disease (ESRD) adults (EnAd) (n=18, 36±7y) and ESRD elderly (EnEld) (n=31, 65±3y) prior to Ktx regarding their naïve, memory and regulatory T and B peripheral lymphocytes. Aging and ESRD presented additive effect decreasing absolute numbers of B and T-lymphocytes, affecting memory, naive and regulatory subsets without synergic effect. Both resulted in higher percentages of T memory subsets and opposing effects on regulatory T (TREG) subsets, higher percentage in aging and lower in ESRD. Combined effect of aging and ESRD also resulted in higher regulatory B cell percentages. In addition to global lymphopenia and TCD4+ memory shift in both aging and ESRD, aging shifts to an immunoregulatory profile, inducing a increase in TREG percentages, contrasting with ESRD that decreases TREGs. Differential immunosuppression regimens for elderly Ktx may be required. (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NTC01631058).",

In this study, we have detected the role of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent autophagic pathway in ALS by using the L-type channel Ca<sup>2+</sup> blocker, verapamil. We have found that verapamil significantly delayed disease onset, prolonged the lifespan and extended disease duration in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice. Furthermore, verapamil administration rescued motor neuron survival and ameliorated skeletal muscle denervation in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice. More interestingly, verapamil significantly reduced SOD1 aggregation and improved autophagic flux, which might be mediated the inhibition of calpain 1 activation in the spinal cord of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that verapamil reduced endoplasmic reticulum stress and suppressed glia activation in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice.

However, the results have so far not been translated to actual benefit for the patients in terms of treatment or diagnosis of age-related degenerative diseases including those of the CNS. As far as the prevention of the cognitive decline during non-pathological aging is concerned, there is nothing much to offer other than calorie restriction and physical exercise. Needless to say, the benefits are not up to our expectations. However, over the years at the experimental level it has been possible to identify several cellular and molecular mechanisms that are intricately associated with aging in general and neurodegenerative diseases in particular. These include oxidative stress and altered redox-signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, proteotoxicity and altered gene expressions. These inter-dependent pathways mediate cellular senescence and often culminate in programmed cell death like apoptosis and autophagy, and in the context of brain these changes are manifested clinically as cognitive decline and pathologically as neurodegeneration. This special issue provides the readers with glimpses of this complex scenario from different angles primarily in the context of brain and also attempts to identify the potential drug targets against neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "The aged population is among the highest at risk for ischemic stroke, yet most stroke patients of advanced ages (>80 years) are excluded from access to thrombolytic treatment by tissue plasminogen activator, the only FDA approved pharmacological therapy for stroke victims. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) robustly alleviate ischemic brain injury in young adult rodents, but have not yet been studied in aged animals. This study investigated whether chronic dietary supplementation of n-3 PUFAs protects aging brain against cerebral ischemia and improves long-term neurological outcomes. Aged (18-month-old) mice were administered n-3 PUFA-enriched fish oil in daily chow for 3 months before and up to 8 weeks after 45 minutes of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Sensorimotor outcomes were assessed by cylinder test and corner test up to 35 days and brain repair dynamics evaluated immunohistologically up to 56 days after tMCAO. Mice receiving dietary supplementation of n-3 PUFAs for 3 months showed significant increases in brain ratio of n-3/n-6 PUFA contents, and markedly reduced long-term sensorimotor deficits and chronic ischemic brain tissue loss after tMCAO. Mechanistically, n-3 PUFAs robustly promoted post-ischemic angiogenesis and neurogenesis, and enhanced white matter integrity after tMCAO. The Pearson linear regression analysis revealed that the enhancement of neurogenesis and white matter integrity both correlated positively with improved sensorimotor activities after tMCAO. This study demonstrates that prophylactic dietary supplementation of n-3 PUFAs effectively improves long-term stroke outcomes in aged mice, perhaps by promoting post-stroke brain repair processes such as angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and white matter restoration.",

    "abstract": "Splenectomy before or immediately after stroke provides early brain protection. This study aims to explore the effect of splenectomy on long-term neurological recovery after stroke, which is currently lacking in the field. Adult male rats were randomized into splenectomy or sham groups and then subjected to 90 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Spleen was removed right upon reperfusion or 3d after MCAO. Infarct volume, neurological functions, and peripheral immune cell populations were assessed up to 28d after stroke. The results show that delayed removal of spleen did not reduce brain tissue loss and showed no effect on sensorimotor function (Rotarod, beam balance, forelimb placing, grid walk, and adhesive removal tests) or cognitive function (Morris water maze). Spleen removal immediately upon reperfusion, although significantly reduced the infarct size and immune cell infiltration 3d after MCAO, also failed to promote long-term recovery. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that immediate splenectomy after MCAO resulted in a prolonged decrease in the percentage of CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T cells in total lymphocytes as compared to non-splenectomy MCAO rats. In contrast, the percentage of CD3-CD45RA+ B cells was significantly elevated after splenectomy. As a result, the ratio of T/B cells was significantly reduced in stroke rats with splenectomy. In conclusion, delayed splenectomy failed to provide long-term protection to the ischemic brain or improve functional recovery. The acute neuroprotective effect achieved by early splenectomy after stroke cannot last for long term. This loss of neuroprotection might be related to the prolonged disturbance in the T cell to B cell ratio.",

    "abstract": "Acute lung injury (ALI) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in the elderly (> 65 years), but the knowledge about origin and effects of immunosenescence in ALI is limited. Here, we investigated the immune response at pulmonary, systemic and cellular level in young (2-3 months) and old (18-19 months) C57BL/6J mice to localize and characterize effects of immunosenescence in ALI. ALI was induced by intranasal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) application and the animals were sacrificed 24 or 72 h later. Pulmonary inflammation was investigated by analyzing histopathology, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cytometry and cytokine expression. Systemic serum cytokine expression, spleen lymphocyte populations and the gut microbiome were analyzed, as well as activation of alveolar and bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) in vitro. Pulmonary pathology of ALI was more severe in old compared with young mice. Old mice showed significantly more inflammatory cells and pro-inflammatory cyto- or chemokines (TNFα, IL-6, MCP-1, CXCL1, MIP-1α) in the BALF, but a delayed expression of cytokines associated with activation of adaptive immunity and microbial elimination (IL-12 and IFNγ). Alveolar macrophages, but not BMDM, of old mice showed greater activation after in vivo and in vitro stimulation with LPS. No systemic enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine response was detected in old animals after LPS exposure, but a delayed expression of IL-12 and IFNγ. Furthermore, old mice had less CD8+ T-cells and NK cells and more regulatory T-cells in the spleen compared with young mice and a distinct gut microbiome structure. The results of our study show an increased alveolar macrophage activation and pro-inflammatory signaling in the lungs, but not systemically, suggesting a key role of senescent alveolar macrophages in ALI. A decrease in stimulators of adaptive immunity with advancing age might further promote the susceptibility to a worse prognosis in ALI in elderly.",

This study aimed to identify the specific neuroanatomical alterations in early, drug-naive PD with MCI (PD-MCI) by comparing to those PD with normal cognition (PD-NC) and healthy controls (HCs), which could help to elucidate the underlying neuropathology and facilitate the development of early therapeutic strategies for treating this disease. Structural MRI data of 237 early, drug-naive non-demented PD patients (classified as 61 PD-MCI and 176 PD-NC) and 69 HCs were included from Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database after data quality control. Within these data, a subset of 61 HCs and a subset of 61 PD-NC who were matched to the 61 PD-MCI group for age, gender, and education-level were selected to further eliminate the sample size effect. The gray matter (GM) volume changes between groups were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Furthermore, correlations between GM volume alterations and neuropsychological performances and non-cognitive assessments (including olfactory performance) were further examined. Compared to HC, patients with PD-NC and PD-MCI commonly exhibited atrophies in the bilateral amygdala (AM) and the left primary motor cortex (M1). Patients with PD-MCI exclusively exhibited atrophy in the right entorhinal cortex (ENT) compared to PD-NC. Significantly negative correlations were found between GM loss in the bilateral AM and olfactory performance in all PD patients, and between ENT loss and memory performance in PD-MCI. The findings suggest that the right ENT atrophy may subserve as a biomarker in early, drug-naive PD-MCI, which shed light on the neural underpinnings of the disease and provide new evidence on differentiating the neuroanatomical states between PD-MCI and PD-NC.",

We used quantitative PCR to measure telomere length using peripheral blood genomic DNA. Telomere lengths were compared in an age- and body mass index (BMI)-dependent manner in 34 healthy volunteers and 43 OSA subjects. We also performed reactive oxygen species assay to measure the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers and OSA subjects. We found that the serum concentration of hydrogen peroxide was considerably higher in OSA patients, and that this was closely related with the severity of OSA. Significantly shortened telomere length was observed in the circulating leukocytes of the peripheral blood of OSA patients, and telomere length shortening was aggravated more acutely in an age- and BMI-dependent manner. An inverse correlation was observed between the concentration of hydrogen peroxide and the telomere length of OSA patients and excessive telomere length shortening was also linked to severity of OSA. The results provided evidence that telomere length shortening or excessive cellular aging might be distinctive in circulating leukocyte of OSA patients and may be an predictive biomarker for reflect the burden of oxidative stress in the peripheral blood of OSA patients.",

    "abstract": "This study analyzes the technologies used in dealing with frailty within the following areas: prevention, care, diagnosis and treatment. The aim of this paper is, on the one hand, to analyze the extent to which technology is present in terms of its relationship with frailty and what technological resources are used to treat it. Its other purpose is to define new challenges and contributions made by physiotherapy using technology. Eighty documents related to research, validation and/or the ascertaining of different types of hardware, software or both were reviewed in prominent areas. The authors used the following scales: in the area of diagnosis, Fried's phenotype model of frailty and a model based on trials for the design of devices. The technologies developed that are based on these models accounted for 55% and 45% of cases respectively. In the area of prevention, the results proved similar regarding the use of wireless sensors with cameras (35.71%), and Kinect™ sensors (28.57%) to analyze movements and postures that indicate a risk of falling. In the area of care, results were found referring to the use of different motion, physiological and environmental wireless sensors (46,15%), i.e. so-called smart homes. In the area of treatment, the results show with a percentage of 37.5% that the Nintendo<sup>®</sup> Wii™ console is the most used tool for treating frailty in elderly persons. Further work needs to be carried out to reduce the gap existing between technology, frail elderly persons, healthcare professionals and carers to bring together the different views about technology. This need raises the challenge of developing and implementing technology in physiotherapy via serious games that may via play and connectivity help to improve the functional capacity, general health and quality of life of frail individuals.",

    "abstract": "In mammalians, advancing age is associated with sarcopenia, the progressive and involuntary loss of muscle mass and strength. Hyperphosphatemia is an aging-related condition involved in several pathologies. The aim of this work was to assess whether hyperphosphatemia plays a role in the age-related loss of mass muscle and strength by inducing cellular senescence in murine myoblasts and to explore the intracellular mechanism involved in this effect. Cultured mouse C2C12 cells were treated with 10 mM beta-glycerophosphate (BGP] at different periods of time to induce hyperphosphatemia. BGP promoted cellular senescence after 24 h of treatment, assessed by the increased expression of p53, acetylated-p53 and p21 and senescence associated β-galactosidase activity. In parallel, BGP increased ILK expression and activity, followed by mTOR activation and autophagy reduction. Knocking-down ILK expression increased autophagy and protected cells from senescence induced by hyperphosphatemia. BGP also reduced the proliferative capacity of cultured myoblasts. Old mice (24-months-old] presented higher serum phosphate concentration, lower forelimb strength, higher expression of p53 and ILK and less autophagy in vastus muscle than young mice (5-months-old]. In conclusion, we propose that hyperphosphatemia induces senescence in cultured myoblasts through ILK overexpression, reducing their proliferative capacity, which could be a mechanism involved in the development of sarcopenia, since old mice showed loss of muscular strength correlated with high serum phosphate concentration and increased levels of ILK and p53.",

    "abstract": "Although age is a dominant risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), epidemiological studies have shown that physical activity may significantly decrease age-related risks for AD, and indeed mitigate the impact in existing diagnosis. The aim of this study was to perform a narrative review on the preventative, and mitigating, effects of physical activity on AD onset, including genetic factors, mechanism of action and physical activity typology. In this article, we conducted a narrative review of the influence physical activity and exercise have on AD, utilising key terms related to AD, physical activity, mechanism and prevention, searching the online databases; Web of Science, PubMed and Google Scholar, and, subsequently, discuss possible mechanisms of this action. On the basis of this review, it is evident that physical activity and exercise may be incorporated in AD, notwithstanding, a greater number of high-quality randomised controlled trials are needed, moreover, physical activity typology must be acutely considered, primarily due to a dearth of research on the efficacy of physical activity types other than aerobic.",

    "abstract": "The neurovascular unit (NVU) plays an important role in maintaining the function of the central nervous system (CNS). Emerging evidence has indicated that the NVU changes function and molecules at the early stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which initiates multiple pathways of neurodegeneration. Cell types in the NVU have become attractive targets in the interventional treatment of AD. The NVU transportation system contains a variety of proteins involved in compound transport and neurotransmission. Brain transporters can be classified as members of the solute carrier (SLC) and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) families in the NVU. Moreover, the transporters can regulate both endogenous toxins, including amyloid-beta (Aβ) and xenobiotic homeostasis, in the brains of AD patients. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified some transporter gene variants as susceptibility loci for late-onset AD. Therefore, the present study summarizes changes in blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability in AD, identifies the location of SLC and ABC transporters in the brain and focuses on major SLC and ABC transporters that contribute to AD pathology.",

    "abstract": "Microglial activation is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Microglia are tightly and efficiently regulated by immune checkpoints, including CD200-CD200R1 and CX3CL1-CX3CR1. Understanding the involvement of these checkpoints in disease progression provides important insights into how microglial activation contributes to PD pathology. However, so far, studies have produced seemingly conflicting results. In this study, we demonstrate that CD200R1 expression is down-regulated at both early and late stage of PD model, and CX3CR1 expression is down-regulated in early stage and recovered in late stage. In primary cultured microglia, CD200R1 and CX3CR1 expressions are both directly regulated by LPS or α-synuclein, and CD200R1 expression is more sensitively regulated than CX3CR1. In addition, CD200 knockout causes an increase in proinflammatory cytokine production and microglial activation in the midbrain. Remarkably, DA neurons in the substantial nigra are degenerated in CD200-/- mice. Finally, activation of the CD200R with CD200Fc alleviates the neuroinflammation in microglia. Together, these results suggest that immune checkpoints play distinct functional roles in different stage of PD pathology, and the CD200-CD200R1 axis plays a significant role in nigrostriatal neuron viability and function.",

    "abstract": "Plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol has been associated both with risk of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and with age-related changes in cognitive function. This prospective study examined the relationship between baseline plasma LDL-cholesterol and cognitive changes in PD and matched Controls. Fasting plasma LDL-cholesterol levels were obtained at baseline from 64 non-demented PD subjects (62.7 ± 7.9 y) and 64 Controls (61.3 ± 6.8 y). Subjects underwent comprehensive neuropsychological testing at baseline, 18-, and 36-months. Linear mixed-effects modeling was used to assess the relationships between baseline LDL-cholesterol levels and longitudinal cognitive changes. At baseline, PD patients had lower scores of fine motor (p<0.0001), executive set shifting (p=0.018), and mental processing speed (p=0.049) compared to Controls. Longitudinally, Controls demonstrated improved fine motor and memory test scores (p=0.044, and p=0.003), whereas PD patients demonstrated significantly accelerated loss in fine motor skill (p=0.002) compared to Controls. Within the PD group, however, higher LDL-cholesterol levels were associated with improved executive set shifting (β=0.003, p<0.001) and fine motor scores (β=0.002, p=0.030) over time. These associations were absent in Controls (p>0.7). The cholesterol - executive set shifting association differed significantly between PDs and Controls (interaction p=0.005), whereas the cholesterol - fine motor association difference did not reach significance (interaction, p=0.104). In summary, higher plasma LDL-cholesterol levels were associated with better executive function and fine motor performance over time in PD, both of which may reflect an effect on nigrostriatal mediation. Confirmation of these results and elucidation of involved mechanisms are warranted, and might lead to feasible therapeutic strategies.",

This deterioration is the primary risk factor for major human pathologies, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, neurovascular disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. There are nine tentative hallmarks of aging. In addition, several of these hallmarks are increasingly being associated with acute brain injury conditions. In this review, we consider the genes and their functional pathways involved in brain aging as a means of developing new strategies for therapies targeted to the neuropathological processes themselves, but also as targets for many age-related brain diseases. A single microRNA (miR), which is a short, non-coding RNA species, has the potential for targeting many genes simultaneously and, like practically all other cellular processes, genes associated with many features of brain aging and injury are regulated by miRs. We highlight how certain miRs can mediate deregulation of genes involved in neuroinflammation, acute neuronal injury and chronic neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, we review the recent progress in the development of effective strategies to block specific miR functions and discuss future approaches with the prediction that anti-miR drugs may soon be used in the clinic.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) contributes to vascular remodeling in hypertension. High mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) has been reported to be involved in several pathogenic processes including VSMC proliferation and migration. The present study was designed to determine the role of HMGB1 in VSMC phenotypic transformation in hypertension. First, we demonstrated that HMGB1 was elevated in a model of Ang II-induced VSMC phenotypic transformation, which showed down-regulation of contractile proteins and up-regulation of synthetic proteins. Knockdown of HMGB1 and losartan could block the phenotypic transformation. Next, we identified three potential miRNAs for upstream regulation of HMGB1 by bioinformatic analysis; only miR-181b-5p was significantly down-regulated in Ang II-treated cells. Co-treating the cells with miR-181b-5p mimics suppressed HMGB1 expression as well as the phenotypic transformation, migration, and proliferation. Furthermore, the luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed the direct interaction between miR-181b-5p and HMGB1. Finally, to extend these cell-based studies to clinical patients, we demonstrated that plasma miR-181b-5p levels were decreased, while Ang II and HMGB1 levels, as well as the intima-media thickness (IMT) were increased in hypertensive patients; these effects were reversed following the administration of angiotensin receptor blockers. Based on these observations, we conclude that the down-regulation of miR-181b-5p leads to the elevation of HMGB1 levels in hypertensive patients, which accounts, at least partially, for VSMCs phenotypic transformation and vascular remodeling. Our findings also highlight that the plasma levels of miR-181b-5p and HMGB1 may serve as novel biomarkers for vascular remodeling in the hypertensive patients.",

The traced ISF from the caudate nucleus drained to the ipsilateral cortex along myelin fiber tracts, while in the opposite direction, its movement to the adjacent thalamus was completely impeded by a barrier structure, which was identified as the converged, compact myelin fascicle. The regulating and the barrier effects of myelin were unchanged in AQP4-knockout rats but were impaired as the integrity of boundary structure of drainage system was destroyed in a demyelinated rat model. We thus proposed that the brain homeostasis was maintained within each ISF drainage division locally, rather than across the brain as a whole. A new brain division system and a new pathogenic mechanism of demyelination are therefore proposed.",

Progressive protein damage and aggregation have been proposed as the root cause of imbalance in regulatory processes and risk factors for aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Oxygen is a modulator of aging. The oxygen-deprived conditions (hypoxia) leads to oxidative stress, cellular damage and protein modifications. Despite unambiguous evidence of the critical role of spontaneous non-enzymatic Degenerative Protein Modifications (DPMs) such as oxidation, glycation, carbonylation, carbamylation, and deamidation, that impart deleterious structural and functional protein alterations during aging and age-associated disorders, the mechanism that mediates these modifications is poorly understood. This review summarizes up-to-date information and recent developments that correlate DPMs, aging, hypoxia, and age-associated neurodegenerative diseases. Despite numerous advances in the study of the molecular hallmark of aging, hypoxia, and degenerative protein modifications during aging and age-associated pathologies, a major challenge remains there to dissect the relative contribution of different DPMs in aging (either natural or hypoxia-induced) and age-associated neurodegeneration.",

Ten databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Science, PEDro, Research Gate, CNKI, CBM, and Wanfang were systematically searched. Eleven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 168 participants with knee OA provided data for the meta-analysis. Statistical significance was reported in four from five outcomes, such as self-related pain (during activity, MD -0.85, 95% CI, -1.55 to -0.14; P =0.02), knee flexibility (MD 7.59, 95% CI, 0.61 to 14.57; P =0.03), knee-related health status (WOMAC scale, MD -4.10, 95% CI, -7.75 to -0.45; P =0.03), and proprioceptive sensibility (MD -4.69, 95% CI, -7.75 to -1.63; P =0.003), while no significant enhancement was reported regarding knee muscle strength (MD 1.25, 95% CI, -0.03 to 2.53; P =0.06). Adverse events were not reported in any of the included trials. The overall quality of evidence was from moderate to very low. In conclusion, there is underpowered evidence to suggest that ET is effective in the treatment of knee OA. Large, well-designed RCTs with better designs are needed.",

A question remains as to whether the blood brain barrier (BBB) is transiently disrupted after circulatory arrest to allow peripheral immune cells to enter brain parenchyma. Here, we developed a clinically relevant cardiac arrest and resuscitation model in mice to investigate the BBB integrity using noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging. Changes in immune signals in the brain and periphery were assayed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Quantitative variance maps from T1-weighted difference images before and after blood-pool contrast clearance revealed BBB disruptions immediately after resuscitation and one day after reperfusion. Time profiles of hippocampal CA1 neuronal injuries correlated with the morphological changes of microglia activation. Cytotoxic T cells, CD11b+CD11c+ dendritic cells, and CD11b+CD45+hi monocytes and macrophages were significantly increased in the brain three days after cardiac arrest and resuscitation, suggesting direct infiltration of these cells following the BBB disruption. Importantly, these immune cell changes were coupled with a parallel increase in the same subset of immune cell populations in the bone marrow and blood. We conclude that neurovascular breakdown during the initial reperfusion phase contributes to the systemic immune cell invasion and subsequent neuropathogenesis affecting the long-term outcome after cardiac arrest and resuscitation.",

However, MSCs age rapidly during long-term ex vivo culture and lose their therapeutic potential before they reach effective cell doses (ECD) for cell therapy. Thus, a prerequisite for effective MSC therapy is the development of cell culture methods to preserve the therapeutic potential during long-term ex vivo cultivation. Resveratrol (RSV) has been highlighted as a therapeutic candidate for bone disease. Although RSV treatment has beneficial effects on bone-forming cells, in vivo studies are lacking. The current study showed that long-term (6 weeks from primary culture date)-cultured MSCs with RSV induction retained their proliferative and differentiation potential despite reaching ECD. The mechanism of RSV action depends entirely on the SIRT1-SOX2 axis in MSC culture. In a rat calvarial defect model, RSV induction significantly improved bone regeneration after MSC transplantation. This study demonstrated an example of efficient MSC therapy for treating bone defects by providing a new strategy using the plant polyphenol RSV.",

    "abstract": "Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is a neurological disorder with a substantial recurrence rate. Atorvastatin is an effective drug for treating hyperlipidemia and known to improve neurological outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage. Previous studies have reported that atorvastatin treatment promotes hematoma absorption in CSDH, while the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated whether the anti-inflammatory effects of atorvastatin mediate absorption of CSDH. 144 male, Wistar rats (6 months old) were randomly divided into the following groups: 1) sham surgery control, 2) treatment: CSDH + atorvastatin, and 3) vehicle control: CSDH + saline. Atorvastatin or saline was orally administered daily for 19 days after CSDH procedure. A T2WI MRI was used to evaluate CSDH volume changes during the time course of the study. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemical staining were used to measure the number of regulatory T cells (Treg). ELISA was used to measure cytokine level in the hematoma border. Neurological function and cognitive outcome were evaluated using Foot-Fault test and Morris Water Maze test, respectively. When compared to saline treatment, atorvastatin treatment accelerated the absorption of CSDH as indicated by decreased hematoma volume in T2WI MRI data on 14th and 21st day after CSDH (P<0.05). Atorvastatin treatment significantly increased the number of Treg in circulation and hematoma border from 3rd to 21st day after CSDH. Atorvastatin treatment significantly decreased the levels of interleukins (IL-6 and IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), but increased IL-10 level in the hematoma border. Atorvastatin treatment also improved neurological function and cognitive outcome compared to vehicle treated group. Atorvastatin induced anti-inflammatory responses and increased Treg in circulation and brain which may contribute to the accelerated CSDH absorption in rats.",

Logistic regression models were adjusted for potential confounders. After a follow-up of 2.0-2.8 years, no association was found between changes in sleep duration and physical function impairment or disability.

In addition, compared to those with no sleep complaints, participants with 2 or more sleep complaints had greater risk of impaired agility, impaired mobility, decreased PCS and impaired lower extremity function in both cohorts.

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic associated with a high mortality. Our study aimed to determine the clinical risk factors associated with disease progression and prolonged viral shedding in patients with COVID-19. Consecutive 564 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 between January 17, 2020 and February 28, 2020 were included in this multicenter, retrospective study. The effects of clinical factors on disease progression and prolonged viral shedding were analyzed using logistic regression and Cox regression analyses. 69 patients (12.2%) developed severe or critical pneumonia, with a higher incidence in the elderly and in individuals with underlying comorbidities, fever, dyspnea, and laboratory and imaging abnormalities at admission. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.06), hypertension without receiving angiotensinogen converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB) therapy (OR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.14-4.59), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 7.55; 95% CI, 2.44-23.39) were independent risk factors for progression to severe or critical pneumonia. Hypertensive patients without receiving ACEI/ARB therapy showed higher lactate dehydrogenase levels and computed tomography (CT) lung scores at about 3 days after admission than those on ACEI/ARB therapy. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that male gender (hazard ratio [HR], 1.22; 95% CI, 1.02-1.46), receiving lopinavir/ritonavir treatment within 7 days from illness onset (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.63-0.90), and receiving systemic glucocorticoid therapy (HR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.46-2.21) were independent factors associated with prolonged viral shedding. Our findings presented several potential clinical factors associated with developing severe or critical pneumonia and prolonged viral shedding, which may provide a rationale for clinicians in medical resource allocation and early intervention.",

In the aged brain, there is a dramatic decrease in the number of stem cells, which is a main cause for the decrease in brain function. Intrinsic factors, such as cell metabolism, have been studied but its role in neurogenesis is still unknown. Therefore, this study sought to establish whether AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling does indeed regulate hippocampal neurogenesis in the aged brain. We found that i) AMPKα2 was the predominant catalytic subunit in the subgranular and subventricular zones; ii) AMPK activation was at a significantly higher level in the aged <i>vs.</i> young hippocampus; iii) short term (7 days) treatment with selective AMPK signaling inhibitor Compound C (10 mg/kg/day, i.p.) significantly increased the numbers of newborn (BrdU<sup>+</sup>), Type 2 (MCM2<sup>+</sup>), and Type 3 (DCX<sup>+</sup>) neural stem cells, but not Type 1 (GFAP<sup>+</sup>/Sox2<sup>+</sup>) cells, in the aged hippocampus. Taken together, our results demonstrate that AMPK signaling plays a critical role in the age-related decline of hippocampal neurogenesis.",

HIV Tat protein is known to be a major pathogenic factor for HIV/neuroAIDS through a myriad of direct and indirect mechanisms. However, most, if not all of studies involve short-time exposure of recombinant Tat protein <i>in vitro</i> or short-term Tat expression <i>in vivo</i>. In this study, we took advantage of the doxycycline-inducible brain-specific HIV-1 Tat transgenic mouse model, fed the animals for 12 months, and assessed behavioral, pathological, and epigenetic changes in these mice. Long-term Tat expression led to poorer short-and long-term memory, lower locomotor activity and impaired coordination and balance ability, increased astrocyte activation and compromised neuronal integrity, and decreased global genomic DNA methylation. There were sex- and brain region-dependent differences in behaviors, pathologies, and epigenetic changes resulting from long-term Tat expression. All these changes are reminiscent of accelerated aging, raising the possibility that HIV Tat contributes, at least in part, to HIV infection-associated accelerated aging in HIV-infected individuals. These findings also suggest another utility of this model for HIV infection-associated accelerated aging studies.",

Thymic production and the export of naïve T cells decrease with aging through the effects of androgens in males and in type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, with aging, recovery of naïve T-cell populations after bone marrow transplantation is delayed and associated with an increased risk of chronic graft vs. host disease. Severe COVID-19 and SARS infections are notable for severe T-cell depletion. In COVID-19, there is unique suppression of interferon signaling by infected respiratory tract cells with intact cytokine signaling. A decreased naïve T-cell response likely contributes to an excessive inflammatory response and increases the odds of a cytokine storm. Treatments that improve naïve T-cell production may prove to be vital COVID-19 therapies, especially for these high-risk groups.",

One of the most abundant such proteins, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), forms stable aggregates with extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ). We detect these aggregates in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from AD patients at levels directly proportional to the progressive stages of AD. We found that GAPDH forms a covalent bond with Q15 of Aβ that is mediated by transglutaminase (tTG). The Q15A substitution weakens the interaction between Aβ and GAPDH and reduces Aβ-GAPDH cytotoxicity. Lentivirus-driven GAPDH overexpression in two AD animal models increased the level of apoptosis of hippocampal cells, neural degeneration, and cognitive dysfunction. In contrast, <i>in vivo</i> knockdown of GAPDH reversed these pathogenic abnormalities suggesting a pivotal role of GAPDH in Aβ-stimulated neurodegeneration. CSF from animals with enhanced GAPDH expression demonstrates increased cytotoxicity <i>in vitro</i>. Furthermore, RX-624, a specific GAPDH small molecular ligand reduced accumulation of Aβ aggregates and reversed memory deficit in AD transgenic mice. These findings argue that extracellular GAPDH compromises Aβ clearance and accelerates neurodegeneration, and, thus, is a promising pharmacological target for AD.",

It is mainly seen in patients with severe acute onset brain injury or presentation of new-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE). The mortality, neurological deficits, and functional impairments are significant depending on the duration of status epilepticus and the resultant brain damage. Research is underway to find the cure for this devastating neurological condition. In this review, we will discuss the wide range of therapies used in the management of SRSE, provide suggestions regarding its treatment, and comment on future directions. The therapies evaluated include traditional and alternative anesthetic agents with antiepileptic agents. The other emerging therapies include hypothermia, steroids, immunosuppressive agents, electrical and magnetic stimulation therapies, emergent respective epilepsy surgery, the ketogenic diet, pyridoxine infusion, cerebrospinal fluid drainage, and magnesium infusion. To date, there is a lack of robust published data regarding the safety and effectiveness of various therapies, and there continues to be a need for large randomized multicenter trials comparing newer therapies to treat this refractory condition.",

Understanding the mechanisms how social support enhances resilience to stress and promotes mental and physical health into old age will enable new preventive strategies.

During aging, loss of muscle mass and strength (sarcopenia and dynapenia) are due, at least in part, to the progressive loss of contacts between muscle fibers and nerves. Despite the important role of tSCs in NMJ function, very little is known on their implication in the NMJ-aging process and in age-associated denervation. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the implication of tSCs in the age-associated degeneration of NMJs.

However, the contents of MSC-EVs would change as their parent MSCs change, hence the therapeutic efficacy of MSC-derived EVs (MSC-EVs) would largely depend on donors, tissue sources and culture conditions of MSCs. To overcome limitations of tissue-derived MSCs, we previously used MSCs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iMSCs) to produce EVs and demonstrated their therapeutic potential in a mouse model of secondary Sjo¨gren's Syndrome. Here, we further found that EVs from early-passage iMSCs had better immunomodulatory potency than EVs from late-passage iMSCs in TLR4-stimulated splenocytes and in a mouse model of primary Sjögren's syndrome. Comparative molecular profiling using proteomics and microRNA sequencing revealed distinctive molecular profiles of iMSC-EVs with or without immunomodulation capacity. Amongst them, manipulation of TGF-β1, miR-21 and miR-125b levels in iMSC-EVs significantly affected their immunosuppressive effects. These findings would help improve our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying iMSC-EV-mediated immunomodulation and further provide strategies to improve regulatory function of EVs for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease which significantly influences the life quality of patients. The protein α-synuclein plays an important driving role in PD occurrence and development. Braak's hypothesis suggests that α-synuclein is produced in intestine, and then spreads into the central nervous system through the vagus nerve. The abnormal expression of α-synuclein has been found in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Intestinal inflammation and intestinal dysbiosis have been involved in the occurrence and development of PD. The present review aimed to summarize recent advancements in studies focusing on intestinal inflammation and PD, especially the mechanisms through which link intestinal inflammation and PD. The intestinal dysfunctions such as constipation have been introduced as non-motor manifestations of PD. The possible linkages between IBD and PD, including genetic overlaps, inflammatory responses, intestinal permeability, and intestinal dysbiosis, are mainly discussed. Although it is not confirmed whether PD starts from intestine, intestinal dysfunction may affect intestinal microenvironment to influence central nervous system, including the α-synuclein pathologies and systematic inflammation. It is expected to develop some new strategies in the diagnosis and treatment of PD from the aspect of intestine. It may also become an exciting direction to find better ways to regulate the composition of gut microorganism to treat PD.",

    "abstract": "Current treatments targeting amyloid beta in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have minimal efficacy, which results in a huge unmet medical need worldwide. Accumulating data suggest that brain mitochondrial dysfunction play a critical role in AD pathogenesis. Targeting cellular mechanisms associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in AD create a novel approach for drug development. This study investigated the effects of nilotinib, as a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in astroglia derived from 3xTg-AD mice versus their C57BL/6-controls. Parameters included oxygen consumption rates (OCR), ATP, cytochrome c oxidase (COX), citrate synthase (CS) activity, alterations in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), key regulators of mitochondrial dynamics (mitofusin (Mfn1), dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)), and mitochondrial biogenesis (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator1-alpha (PGC-1α), calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2)). Nilotinib increased OCR, ATP, COX, Mfn1, and OXPHOS levels in 3xTg astroglia. No significant differences were detected in levels of Drp1 protein and CS activity. Nilotinib enhanced mitochondrial numbers, potentially through a CaMKII-PGC1α-Nrf2 pathway in 3xTg astroglia. Additionally, nilotinib-induced OCR increases were reduced in the presence of the NF-κB inhibitor, Bay11-7082. The data suggest that NF-κB signaling is intimately involved in nilotinib-induced changes in bioenergetics in 3xTg brain astroglia. Nilotinib increased translocation of the NF-κB p50 subunit into the nucleus of 3xTg astroglia that correlates with an increased expression and activation of NF-κB. The current findings support a role for nilotinib in improving mitochondrial function and suggest that astroglia may be a key therapeutic target in treating AD.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension is a common comorbidity that contributes to the development of various cardiovascular disorders in elderly patients. Moreover, hypertension has been associated with cognitive decline and dementia. Cognitive impairment leads to increased morbidity and mortality in elderly patients with hypertension. However, previous studies investigating the association between blood pressure (BP), BP variability (BPV), and antihypertensive drug use and the risk of cognitive impairment in elderly patients with hypertension have reported inconsistent findings. Given the global burden of hypertension, the aging population, and the low quality of life associated with cognitive impairment, a more comprehensive understanding of the association between hypertension and cognitive decline is needed. In this review, we summarized the current preclinical evidence and clinical research regarding the association of BP control, BPV, and antihypertensive drug use and cognitive function. We particularly focused on the differences among categories of antihypertensive drugs. We concluded that the correlation of BP and risk of cognitive function is non-linear and dependent on a patient's age. Intensive BP control is generally not recommended, particularly for the oldest-old. Increased BPV and characteristics of orthostatic hypotension in the elderly also increase the risk of cognitive decline. The current evidence does not support one category of antihypertensive drugs as superior to others for preventing dementia in elderly patients with hypertension.",

    "abstract": "Cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), also referred to as scavenger receptor B2, has been shown to serve multiple functions in lipid metabolism, inflammatory signaling, oxidative stress, and energy reprogramming. As a scavenger receptor, CD36 interacts with various ligands, such as oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1), and fatty acid (FA), thereby activating specific downstream signaling pathways. Cardiac CD36 is mostly expressed on the surface of cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells. The pathophysiological process of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) encompasses diverse metabolic abnormalities, such as enhanced transfer of cardiac myocyte sarcolemmal FA, increased levels of advanced glycation end-products, elevation in oxidative stress, impaired insulin signaling cascade, disturbance in calcium handling, and microvascular rarefaction which are closely related to CD36 signaling. This review presents a summary of the CD36 signaling pathway that acts mainly as a long-chain FA transporter in cardiac myocytes and functions as a receptor to bind to numerous ligands in endothelial cells. Finally, we summarize the recent basic research and clinical findings regarding CD36 signaling in DCM, suggesting a promising strategy to treat this condition.",

Accelerated telomere shortening is related to premature cellular senescence. Shortened telomere lengths (TL) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various chronic immune-mediated and neurological diseases. We aimed to systematically review the current literature on the association of TL as a measure of biological age and multiple sclerosis (MS). A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify original studies that presented data on TL in samples from persons with MS. Quantitative and qualitative information was extracted from the articles to summarize and compare the studies. A total of 51 articles were screened, and 7 of them were included in this review. In 6 studies, average TL were analyzed in peripheral blood cells, whereas in one study, bone marrow-derived cells were used. Four of the studies reported significantly shorter leukocyte TL in at least one MS subtype in comparison to healthy controls (<i>p</i>=0.003 in meta-analysis). Shorter telomeres in patients with MS were found to be associated, independently of age, with greater disability, lower brain volume, increased relapse rate and more rapid conversion from relapsing to progressive MS. However, it remains unclear how telomere attrition in MS may be linked to oxidative stress, inflammation and age-related disease processes. Despite few studies in this field, there is substantial evidence on the association of TL and MS. Variability in TL appears to reflect heterogeneity in clinical presentation and course. Further investigations in large and well-characterized cohorts are warranted. More detailed studies on TL of individual chromosomes in specific cell types may help to gain new insights into the pathomechanisms of MS.",

This paper provides a systematic review of PD patient clustering research, evaluating the variables included in clustering, the cluster methods applied, the resulting patient subgroups, and evaluation metrics. A search was conducted from 1999 to 2021 on the PubMed database, using various search terms including: Parkinson's disease, cluster, and analysis. The majority of studies included a variety of clinical scale scores for clustering, of which many provide a numerical, but ordinal, categorical value. Even though the scale scores are ordinal, these were treated as numerical values with numerical and continuous values being the focus of the clustering, with limited attention to categorical variables, such as gender and family history, which may also provide useful insights into disease diagnosis, progression, and treatment. The results pointed to two to five patient clusters, with similarities among the age of onset and disease duration. The studies lacked the use of existing clustering evaluation metrics which points to a need for a thorough, analysis framework, and consensus on the appropriate variables to include in cluster analysis. Accurate cluster analysis may assist with determining if PD patients' symptoms can be treated based on a subgroup of features, if personalized care is required, or if a mix of individualized and group-based care is the best approach.",

    "abstract": "Stroke is one of the most prevalent causes of death around the world. When a stroke occurs, many cellular signaling cascades and regulators are activated, which results in severe cellular dysfunction and debilitating long-term disability. One crucial regulator of cell fate and function is mammalian Forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1). Many studies have found FoxO1 to be implicated in many cellular processes, including regulating gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. During a stroke, modifications of FoxO1 have been linked to a variety of functions, such as inducing cell death and inflammation, inhibiting oxidative injury, affecting the blood brain barrier (BBB), and regulating hepatic gluconeogenesis. For these functions of FoxO1, different measures and treatments were applied to FoxO1 after ischemia. However, the subtle mechanisms of post-transcriptional modification and the role of FoxO1 are still elusive and even contradictory in the development of stroke. The determination of these mechanisms will lead to further enlightenment for FoxO1 signal transduction and the identification of targeted drugs. The regulation and function of FoxO1 may provide an important way for the prevention and treatment of diseases. Overall, the functions of FoxO1 are multifactorial, and this paper will summarize all of the significant pathways in which FoxO1 plays an important role during stroke damage and recovery.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by an infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is rapidly becoming a worldwide epidemic and poses a significant threat to human life and health. SARS-CoV-2 can cause damage to organs throughout the body through ACE2 receptors. It may have direct and indirect effects on osteoclasts, and osteoblasts and lead to osteoporosis. Vitamin D (VitD) is a key hormone for bone health and has immunomodulatory actions of relevance in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Vitamin D deficiency has a significant positive association with both infection and the mortality rate of COVID-19. Elderly patients infected by COVID-19 were more likely to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which was primarily caused by an inflammation storm. The production of proinflammatory cytokines increases with COVID-19 infection and immobilization may result in bone loss and bone resorption in seriously ill patients, especially aging patients. It is well known that glucocorticoids are beneficial in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) because they reduce inflammation and improve the functioning of the lung and extrapulmonary organs. Glucocorticoid therapy is widely used to treat patients with COVID-19 in most parts of the world. During COVID-19 clinical treatment, glucocorticoids may accelerate bone loss in elderly people, making them more susceptible to the development of osteoporosis. Therefore, it is worthwhile to draw the attention of clinicians and researchers to the linkages and interactions between COVID-19, glucocorticoids, and osteoporosis (especially in elderly patients).",

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects the nigrostriatal pathway in the midbrain, presenting not only motor symptoms but also various non-motor manifestations, including neuropsychiatric symptoms and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Over time, our knowledge of PD has progressed from the detection of midbrain dopaminergic deficits to the identification of a multifaceted disease with a variety of central and peripheral manifestations, with increased attention to the intestinal tract. Accumulating evidence has revealed that intestinal disorders are not only the peripheral consequence of PD pathogenesis, but also the possible pathological initiator decades before it progresses to the CNS. Here, we summarized recent research findings on the involvement of the intestinal environment in PD, with an emphasis on the involvement of the intestinal barrier, microbiome and its metabolites, inflammation, and enteric glial cells.",

    "abstract": "As the aging population grows, chronic age-related bone degenerative diseases become more prevalent and severe. One such disease, periodontitis (PD), rises to 70.1% prevalence in Americans 65 years and older. PD has been linked to increased risk of other age-related diseases with more serious mortality and morbidity profiles such as Alzheimer’s disease and cardiovascular disease, but the cellular and biological mechanisms remain unclear. Recent <i>in vitro</i> studies from our group indicate that murine dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells are vulnerable to immune senescence. This occurs through a distinct process involving invasion of DCs by dysbiotic pathogen <i>Porphyromonas gingivalis</i> (Pg) activating the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Exosomes of the Pg-induced SASP transmit senescence to normal bystander DC and T cells, ablating antigen presentation. The biological significance of these findings <i>in vivo</i> and the mechanisms involved were examined in the present study using young (4-5mo) or old (22-24mo) mice subjected to ligature-induced PD, with or without dysbiotic oral pathogen and injection of Pg-induced DC exosomes. Senescence profiling of gingiva and draining lymph nodes (LN) corroborates role of advanced age and PD in elevation of senescence biomarkers beta galactosidase (SA-β-Gal), p16 <sup>INK4A</sup> p21<sup>Waf1/Clip1</sup>, IL6, TNFα, and IL1β, with attendant increase in alveolar bone loss, reversed by senolytic agent rapamycin. Immunophenotyping of gingiva and LN revealed that myeloid CD11c+ DCs and T cells are particularly vulnerable to senescence <i>in vivo</i> under these conditions. Moreover, Pg-induced DC exosomes were the most potent inducers of alveolar bone loss and immune senescence, and capable of overcoming senescence resistance of LN T cells in young mice. We conclude that immune senescence, compounded by advanced age, and accelerated by oral dysbiosis and its induced SASP exosomes, plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of experimental periodontitis.",

Understanding the molecular and metabolic mechanisms underlying development of hepatic IRI is critical for developing effective therapies for hepatic IRI. Recent advances in research have improved our understanding of the pathogenesis of IRI. During IRI, hepatocyte injury and inflammatory responses are mediated by crosstalk between the immune cells and metabolic components. This crosstalk can be targeted to treat or reverse hepatic IRI. Thus, a deep understanding of hepatic microenvironment, especially the immune and metabolic responses, can reveal new therapeutic opportunities for hepatic IRI. In this review, we describe important cells in the liver microenvironment (especially non-parenchymal cells) that regulate immune inflammatory responses. The role of metabolic components in the diagnosis and prevention of hepatic IRI are discussed.

In this review, we have summarized the changes in differentiation trajectories of distinct cell types and highlighted the specific pathways and genes in brain cells that are impacted by stroke.

    "abstract": "Low ovarian reserve is a serious condition, leading to sterility in up to 10% of women in their mid-thirties. According to current knowledge, serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels for age are the best available marker for the screening the quantity of a woman's functional ovarian reserve, better than age alone or other reproductive markers. This review summarizes recent findings, clinical utility and limitations in the application of serum AMH testing as an accurate marker for the screening of functional ovarian reserves and predicting age at menopause. AMH assessment hold promise in helping women make informed decisions about their future fertility and desired family size. However, screening of the functional ovarian reserve could be offered to all women at 26 years of age or older who seek to assess future fertility or in case of personal request, ovarian reserve screening may be considered beyond 30 years; however, it has never been advocated beyond 35 years, since it is not advisable to delay childbearing beyond this age. In this respect, an age-specific serum AMH levels lower than the 10th percentile may be used as a threshold for the identification of a low functional ovarian reserve in an individual woman. Its level should be interpreted with caution in the adolescent and young women aged below 25 years (since AMH levels peak at this age); recent users of hormonal contraceptives (since AMH levels transiently decrease until two months after discontinuation); and women with PCOS (which dramatically increases AMH levels). However, the ability of AMH levels to predict the time to menopause is promising but requires further investigation and routine AMH testing for the purposes of predicting the time to menopause is not recommended.",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitination is a reversible post-translational modification implicated in cell differentiation, homeostasis, and organ development. Several deubiquitinases (DUBs) decrease protein ubiquitination through the hydrolysis of ubiquitin linkages. However, the role of DUBs in bone resorption and formation is still unclear. In this study, we identified DUB ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) as a negative regulator of osteoclast formation. USP7 combines with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and inhibits its ubiquitination by impairing the Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chain. Such impairment leads to the suppression of receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)-mediated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) activation without affecting TRAF6 stability. USP7 also protects the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) against degradation, inducing interferon-β (IFN-β) expression in osteoclast formation, thereby inhibiting osteoclastogenesis cooperatively with the classical TRAF6 pathway. Furthermore, USP7 inhibition accelerates osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption both in vitro and in vivo. Contrarily, USP7 overexpression impairs osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, in ovariectomy (OVX) mice, USP7 levels are lower than those in sham-operated mice, suggesting that USP7 plays a role in osteoporosis. Altogether, our data reveal the dual effect of USP7-mediated TRAF6 signal transduction and USP7-mediated protein degradation of STING in osteoclast formation.",

This report aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety in patients with anti-acetylcholine receptor-positive (AChR+) generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG). We performed a prospective, open-label, single-arm study in patients with gMG in a 48-week follow-up. All patients were AChR+ and were given tocilizumab by intravenous infusion at a dose of 8 mg/kg at intervals of 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was mean change from baseline in quantitative MG (QMG) score at week 12. The secondary endpoints were mean changes from baseline in MG activities of daily living (MG-ADL) score, AChR-ab titers, and the dosage of oral prednisone at week 12. At week 48, QMG, MG-ADL, and the use of prednisone were also evaluated. Fourteen gMG patients were enrolled and all of them completed the study. Tocilizumab treatment started 8 (4-192) months after the onset of gMG. During tocilizumab treatment, the QMG score was significantly decreased from 15.5 (interqualile range, 9-26) at baseline to 4 (0-9) at week 12 (p < 0.001). The change of ADL was decreased from 14.5(11-19) at baseline to 4 (0-19) at week 12 (p < 0.001) and the change of AChR-ab titers from 15 (7.5-19) at baseline to 6.8 (11.6-4.3) at week 12 (p < 0.001).

By the end of the study, the QMG score was 2 (0-7) and MG-ADL score was 1.5 (0-6). 12 (85.7%) patients achieved minimal manifestations. 4 (28.6%) patients were able to discontinue prednisone. No patients experienced exacerbation at the end of the study. No serious adverse events were observed during follow-up.

All types of stimulation that occur in sports play an important role in regulating the physiological activities of bone. Here, we track the latest research progress locally and abroad, summarize the recent, relevant research results, and systematically summarize the effects of different types of exercise on bone mass, bone strength and bone metabolism. We found that different types of exercise have different effects on bone health due to their unique technical characteristics. Oxidative stress is an important mechanism mediating the exercise regulation of bone homeostasis. Excessive high-intensity exercise does not benefit bone health but induces a high level of oxidative stress in the body, which has a negative impact on bone tissue. Regular moderate exercise can improve the body's antioxidant defense ability, inhibit an excessive oxidative stress response, promote the positive balance of bone metabolism, delay age-related bone loss and deterioration of bone microstructures and have a prevention and treatment effect on osteoporosis caused by many factors. Based on the above findings, we provide evidence for the role of exercise in the prevention and treatment of bone diseases. This study provides a systematic basis for clinicians and professionals to reasonably formulate exercise prescriptions and provides exercise guidance for patients and the general public.

Fibrosis and neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) often occur with aging, imposing large burdens on public health worldwide, and there are currently no effective treatment strategies for these diseases. Mitochondrial sirtuins (SIRT3-5), which are members of the sirtuin family of NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacylases and ADP-ribosyltransferases, are capable of regulating mitochondrial function by modifying mitochondrial proteins that participate in the regulation of cell survival under various physiological and pathological conditions.

SIRT3-5 are also involved in multiple age-related NDs, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. Furthermore, SIRT3-5 have been noted as promising targets for antifibrotic therapies and the treatment of NDs.

Therefore, hypoxia is a stressor that induces beneficial or harmful adaptations, depending on the dose. While severe hypoxia can exert detrimental effects, such as high-altitude illnesses, moderate and controlled oxygen exposure can potentially be used therapeutically. It can improve numerous pathological conditions, including vascular abnormalities, and potentially slows down the progression of various age-related disorders. Hypoxia can exert beneficial effects on inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial functions, and cell survival, which are all increased with age and have been discussed as main promotors of aging. This narrative review discusses specificities of the aging cardiovascular system in hypoxia. It draws upon an extensive literature search on the effects of hypoxia/altitude interventions (acute, prolonged, or intermittent exposure) on the cardiovascular system in older individuals (over 50 years old). Special attention is directed toward the use of hypoxia exposure to improve cardiovascular health in older individuals.",

    "abstract": "Migraine is a common neurological disease displaying an unusual dependence on age. For most patients, the peak intensity of migraine headaches occurs in 20s and lasts until 40s, but then headache attacks become less intense, occur less frequently and the disease is more responsive to therapy. This relationship is valid in both females and males, although the prevalence of migraine in the former is 2-4 times greater than the latter. Recent concepts present migraine not only as a pathological event, but rather as a part of evolutionary adaptive response to protect organism against consequences of stress-induced brain energy deficit. However, these concepts do not fully explain that unusual dependence of migraine prevalence on age. Many aspects of aging, both molecular/cellular and social/cognitive, are interwound in migraine pathogenesis, but they neither explain why only some persons are affected by migraine, nor suggest any causal relationship. In this narrative/hypothesis review we present information on associations of migraine with chronological aging, brain aging, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion as well as social, cognitive, epigenetic, and metabolic aging. We also underline the role of oxidative stress in these associations. We hypothesize that migraine affects only individuals who have inborn, genetic/epigenetic, or acquired (traumas, shocks or complexes) migraine predispositions. These predispositions weakly depend on age and affected individuals are more prone to migraine triggers than others. Although the triggers can be related to many aspects of aging, social aging may play a particularly important role as the prevalence of its associated stress has a similar age-dependence as the prevalence of migraine. Moreover, social aging was shown to be associated with oxidative stress, important in many aspects of aging. In perspective, molecular mechanisms underlying social aging should be further explored and related to migraine with a closer association with migraine predisposition and difference in prevalence by sex.",

    "abstract": "Physiologically aged lungs are prone to senescence-associated pulmonary diseases (SAPD). This study aimed to determine the mechanism and subtype of aged T cells affecting alveolar type II epithelial (AT2) cells, which promote the pathogenesis of senescence-associated pulmonary fibrosis (SAPF). Cell proportions, the relationship between SAPD and T cells, and the aging- and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) of T cells between young and aged mice were analyzed using lung single-cell transcriptomics. SAPD was monitored by markers of AT2 cells and found to be induced by T cells. Furthermore, IFNγ signaling pathways were activated and cell senescence, SASP, and T cell activation were shown in aged lungs. Physiological aging led to pulmonary dysfunction and TGF-β1/IL-11/MEK/ERK (TIME) signaling-mediated SAPF, which was induced by senescence and SASP of aged T cells. Especially, IFNγ was produced by the accumulated CD4<sup>+</sup> effector memory T (T<sub>EM</sub>) cells in the aged lung. This study also found that physiological aging increased pulmonary CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells, IFNγ was produced mainly by CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells, and pulmonary cells had increased responsiveness to IFNγ signaling. Specific regulon activity was increased in T cell subclusters. IFNγ transcriptionally regulated by IRF1 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells promoted the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by activating TIME signaling and cell senescence of AT2 cells with aging. Accumulated IRF1<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM </sub>produced IFNγ in lung with aging and anti-IRF1 primary antibody treatment inhibited the expression of IFNγ. Aging might drive T cell differentiation toward helper T cells with developmental trajectories and enhance cell interactions of pulmonary T cells with other surrounding cells. Thus, <i>IFNγ</i> transcribed by IRF1 in CD4<sup>+</sup> effector memory T cells promotes SAPF. IFNγ produced by CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells in physiologically aged lungs could be a therapeutic target for preventing SAPF.",

    "abstract": "Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) has a close relationship with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and was even regarded as the most reliable hallmark of prodromal PD. RBD might have similar changes in gut dysbiosis to PD, but the relationship between RBD and PD in gut microbial alterations is rarely studied. In this study, we aim to investigate whether there are consistent changes between RBD and PD in gut microbiota, and find some specific biomarkers in RBD that might indicate phenoconversion to PD. Alpha-diversity showed no remarkable difference and beta-diversity showed significant differences based on the unweighted (R = 0.035, <i>P</i> = 0.037) and weighted (R = 0.0045, <i>P</i> = 0.008) UniFrac analysis among idiopathic RBD (iRBD), PD with RBD, PD without RBD and normal controls (NC). Enterotype distribution indicated iRBD, PD with RBD and PD without RBD were <i>Ruminococcus</i>-dominant while NC were <i>Bacteroides</i>-dominant. 7 genera (4 increased: <i>Aerococcus</i>, <i>Eubacterium</i>, <i>Gordonibacter</i> and <i>Stenotrophomonas</i>, 3 decreased: <i>Butyricicoccus</i>, <i>Faecalibacterium</i> and <i>Haemophilus</i>) were consistently changed in iRBD and PD with RBD. Among them, 4 genera (<i>Aerococcus</i>, <i>Eubacterium</i>, <i>Butyricicoccus</i>, <i>Faecalibacterium</i>) remained distinctive in the comparison between PD with RBD and PD without RBD. Through clinical correlation analysis, <i>Butyricicoccus</i> and <i>Faecalibacterium</i> were found negatively correlated with the severity of RBD (RBD-HK). Functional analysis showed iRBD had similarly increased staurosporine biosynthesis to PD with RBD. Our study indicates that RBD has similar gut microbial changes to PD. Decreased <i>Butyricicoccus</i> and <i>Faecalibacterium</i> might be potential hallmarks of phenoconversion of RBD to PD.",

Reperfusion, an important myocardial ischemia tool, causes unexpected and irreversible damage to cardiomyocytes, resulting in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury. Upon stress, especially oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS), autophagy, which degrades the intracellular energy storage to produce metabolites that are recycled into metabolic pathways to buffer metabolic stress, is initiated during myocardial ischemia and MI/R injury. Excellent cardioprotective effects of autophagy regulators against MI and MI/R have been reported. Reversing disordered cardiac metabolism induced by ROS also exhibits cardioprotective action in patients with myocardial ischemia. Herein, we review current knowledge on the crosstalk between ROS, cardiac autophagy, and metabolism in myocardial ischemia and MI/R. Finally, we discuss the possible regulators of autophagy and metabolism that can be exploited to harness the therapeutic potential of cardiac metabolism and autophagy in the diagnosis and treatment of myocardial ischemia and MI/R.",

Astrocytes are special glial cells within the central nervous system and play important roles in mediating neuroprotection and repair processes during stroke. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are lipid bilayer particles released from cells that facilitate intercellular communication in stroke by delivering proteins, lipids, and RNA to target cells. Recently, accumulating evidence suggested that astrocyte-derived EVs (ADEVs) are actively involved in mediating numerous biological processes including neuroprotection and neurorepair in stroke and they are realized as an excellent therapeutic approach for treating stroke. In this review we systematically summarize the up-to-date research on ADEVs in stroke, and prospects for its potential as a novel therapeutic target for stroke. We also provide an overview of the effects and functions of ADEVs on stroke recovery, which may lead to developing clinically relevant therapies for stroke.",

Deep learning with FastSurfer segmented 96 brain regions. Separate models segmented visceral and subcutaneous abdominal fat. Regression analyses of abdominal fat types and normalized brain volumes were evaluated, controlling for age and sex. Logistic regression models determined the risk of brain total gray and white matter volume loss from the highest quartile of visceral fat and lowest quartile of these brain volumes. This cohort had an average age of 52.9 ± 13.1 years with 52.8% men and 47.2% women. Segmented visceral abdominal fat predicted lower volumes in multiple regions including: total gray matter volume (r = -.44, p<.001), total white matter volume (r =-.41, p<.001), hippocampus (r = -.39, p< .001), frontal cortex (r = -.42, p<.001), temporal lobes (r = -.44, p<.001), parietal lobes (r = -.39, p<.001), occipital lobes (r =-.37, p<.001). Women showed lower brain volumes than men related to increased visceral fat. Visceral fat predicted increased risk for lower total gray matter (age 20-39: OR = 5.9; age 40-59, OR = 5.4; 60-80, OR = 5.1) and low white matter volume: (age 20-39: OR = 3.78; age 40-59, OR = 4.4; 60-80, OR = 5.1). Higher subcutaneous fat is related to brain volume loss. Elevated visceral and subcutaneous fat predicted lower brain volumes and may represent novel modifiable factors in determining brain health.",

    "abstract": "Interleukin-(IL)-11 is a cytokine involved in hematopoiesis, cancer metastasis, and inflammation. IL-11 belongs to the IL-6 cytokine family, binding to the complex of receptors glycoprotein gp130 and the ligand-specific-receptor subunits (IL-11Rα or their soluble counterpart sIL-11R). IL-11/IL-11R signaling enhances osteoblast differentiation and bone formation and mitigates osteoclast-induced bone resorption and cancer bone metastasis. Recent studies have shown that systemic and osteoblast/osteocyte-specific IL-11 deficiency leads to reduced bone mass and formation, but also adiposity, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance. In humans, mutations of IL-11 and the receptor IL-11RA genes are associated with height reduction, osteoarthritis, and craniosynostosis. In this review, we describe the emerging role of IL-11/IL-11R signaling in bone metabolism by targeting osteoblasts, osteoclasts, osteocytes, and bone mineralization. Furthermore, IL-11 promotes osteogenesis and suppresses adipogenesis, thereby influencing the fate of osteoblast/adipocyte differentiation derived from pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells. We have newly identified IL-11 as a bone-derived cytokine that regulates bone metabolism and the link between bone and other organs. Thus, IL-11 is vital in bone homeostasis and could be considered a potential therapeutic strategy.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant lipid metabolism has been strongly linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. However, the role of lipids in the pathophysiological processes of AD and their clinical progression is unclear. We hypothesized that plasma lipids are associated with the pathological hallmarks of AD, progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD, and the rate of cognitive decline in MCI patients. To evaluate our hypotheses, we analysed the plasma lipidome profile by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry in an LC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS platform for 213 subjects recruited consecutively: 104 AD, 89 MCI, and 20 control subjects. Forty-seven (52.8%) MCI patients progressed to AD during follow-up (58 ± 12.5 months). We found that higher plasma levels of sphingomyelin SM(36:0) and diglyceride DG(44:3) were associated with an increased risk of amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42) positivity in CSF, while levels of SM(40:1) were associated with a reduced risk. Higher plasma levels of ether-linked triglyceride TG(O-60:10) were negatively associated with pathological levels of phosphorylated tau in CSF. Plasma levels of fatty acid ester of hydroxy fatty acid FAHFA(34:0) and ether-linked phosphatidylcholine PC(O-36:1) were positively associated with pathological levels of total tau in CSF. Regarding the plasma lipids most associated with progression from MCI to AD, our analysis detected phosphatidyl-ethanolamine plasmalogen PE(P-36:4), TG(59:12), TG(46:0), and TG(O-62:7). Furthermore, TG(O-62:7) was the lipid that was most strongly associated with the rate of progression. In conclusion, our results indicate that neutral and ether-linked lipids are involved in the pathophysiological processes of AD and the progression from MCI to AD dementia, suggesting the involvement of lipid-mediated antioxidant mechanisms in AD.",

Cellular senescence is a physiological or pathological cellular state caused by aging and a prominent risk factor for the interruption of the integrity and functionality of human biological barriers. Health barriers play an important role in maintaining microenvironmental homeostasis within the body. The senescence of barrier cells leads to barrier dysfunction and age-related diseases. Cellular senescence has been reported to be a key target for the prevention of age-related barrier diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and preeclampsia. Drugs such as metformin, dasatinib, quercetin, BCL-2 inhibitors, and rapamycin have been shown to intervene in cellular senescence and age-related diseases.

We further outline the cellular pathways and mechanisms underlying barrier impairment caused by cellular senescence and describe age-related barrier diseases associated with senescent cells.

Mitochondria can release mitochondrial DAMPs (mtDAMPs) to initiate an immune response when stimulated with cellular stress. Investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying the DAMPs that regulate CVD progression is crucial for improving CVDs. Herein, we discuss the composition and mechanism of DAMPs, the significance of mtDAMPs in cellular inflammation, the presence of mtDAMPs in different types of cells, and the main signaling pathways associated with mtDAMPs. Based on this, we determined the role of DAMPs in CVDs and the effects of mtDAMP intervention on CVD progression.

AD gradually affects the parts of the brain that control thoughts, language, behavior and mental function, severely impacting a person's ability to carry out daily activities and ultimately leading to death. The accumulation of extracellular amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) and the aggregation of intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau are the two key pathological hallmarks of AD. AD is a complex condition that involves both non-genetic risk factors (35%) and genetic risk factors (58-79%). The glymphatic system plays an essential role in clearing metabolic waste, transporting tissue fluid, and participating in the immune response. Both non-genetic and genetic risk factors affect the glymphatic system to varying degrees. The main purpose of this review is to summarize the underlying mechanisms involved in the deregulation of the glymphatic system during the progression of AD, especially concerning the diverse contributions of non-genetic and genetic risk factors. In the future, new targets and interventions that modulate these interrelated mechanisms will be beneficial for the prevention and treatment of AD.",

With the aging of the cerebellum, there is a decline in balance and motor function, particularly fine motor skills, and an increased risk of falling. However, in recent years, numerous studies have revealed that the cerebellum has several roles besides balance and fine motor skills, such as cognitive function and memory. It also plays a role in many neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, the cerebellum ages more rapidly than other brain regions, including the hippocampus. With increasing studies reporting that the cerebellum has a more prominent and interconnected role in the brain, it is essential to understand why aging affects it more, leading to solutions to help curb the accelerated decline. Here, we summarize the cerebellum's function and look at how it ages at the cellular, molecular, and functional levels.

    "abstract": "In the context of an aging global population and the imperative for innovative healthcare solutions, the concept of longevity clinics emerges as a timely and vital area of exploration. Unlike traditional medical facilities, longevity clinics offer a unique approach to preclinical prevention, focusing on \"prevention of prevention\" through the utilization of aging clocks and biomarkers from healthy individuals. This article presents a comprehensive overview of longevity clinics, encompassing descriptions of existing models, the development of a proposed framework, and insights into biomarkers, wearable devices, and therapeutic interventions. Additionally, economic justifications for investing in longevity clinics are examined, highlighting the significant growth potential of the global biotechnology market and its alignment with the goals of achieving active longevity. Anchored by an Analytical Center, the proposed framework underscores the importance of data-driven decision-making and innovation in promoting prolonged and enhanced human life. At present, there is no universally accepted standard model for longevity clinics. This absence highlights the need for additional research and ongoing improvements in this field. Through a synthesis of scientific research and practical considerations, this article aims to stimulate further discussion and innovation in the field of longevity clinics, ultimately contributing to the advancement of healthcare practices aimed at extending and enhancing human life.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease-related disorders (ADRD) are progressive neurodegenerative diseases without cure. Alzheimer's disease occurs in 2 forms, early-onset familial AD and late-onset sporadic AD. Early-onset AD is a rare (~1%), autosomal dominant, caused by mutations in presenilin-1, presenilin-2, and amyloid precursor protein genes and the other is a late-onset, prevalent and is evolved due to age-associated complex interactions between environmental and genetic factors, in addition to apolipoprotein E4 polymorphism. Cellular senescence, promoting the impairment of physical and mental functions is constituted to be the main cause of aging, the primary risk factor for AD, which results in progressive loss of cognitive function, memory, and visual-spatial skills for an individual to live or act independently. Despite significant progress in the understanding of the biology and pathophysiology of AD, we continue to lack definitive early detectable biomarkers and/or drug targets that can be used to delay the development of AD and ADRD in elderly populations. However, recent developments in the studies of DNA double-strand breaks result in the release of fragmented DNA into the bloodstream and contribute to higher levels of cell-free DNA (cf-DNA). This fragmented cf-DNA can be released into the bloodstream from various cell types, including normal cells and cells undergoing apoptosis or necrosis and elevated levels of cf-DNA in the blood have the potential to serve as blood blood-based biomarker for early detection of AD and ADRD. The overall goal of our study is to discuss the latest developments in circulating cell-free DNA into the blood in the progression of AD and ADRD. Our article summarized the status of research on double-strand breaks and circulating cell-free DNA in both healthy and disease states and how these recent developments can be used to develop early detectable biomarkers for AD and ADRD. Our article also discussed the impact of lifestyle and epigenetic factors that are involved in DNA double-strand breaks and circulating cell-free DNA in AD and ADRD.",

The regulation of this system is controlled by clock genes, which function to harmoniously express molecular levels that facilitate the orderly coordination of various cellular processes, such as sleep, metabolism, endocrine function, cell proliferation and immunity. The root cause of tumorigenesis is that the body loses its normal regulation of cell growth at the genetic level. Long-term disruptions in circadian rhythms caused by factors such as shift work, jet lag, and unstable sleep patterns can impact cellular health, leading to various health problems, including cancer. Circadian rhythm controls most cellular functions related to cancer progression, which has a significant impact on the ability of immune cells to detect cancer cells and promote their clearance and has crucial implication for future tumor immunotherapy. This article aims to review the crosstalk between dysregulation of circadian rhythm and tumorigenesis, tumor metabolism, and immune response. Additionally, we discuss the role of circadian rhythm disruption in tumor therapy, highlighting its potential to optimize treatment timing and improve therapeutic outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Our study aimed to construct a predictive model for identifying instances of futile recanalization in patients with anterior circulation occlusion acute ischemic stroke (AIS) who achieved complete reperfusion following endovascular therapy. We included 173 AIS patients who attained complete reperfusion, as indicated by a Modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) scale score of 3. Our approach involved a thorough analysis of clinical factors, imaging biomarkers, and potential no-reflow biomarkers through both univariate and multivariate analyses to identify predictors of futile recanalization. The comprehensive model includes clinical factors such as age, presence of diabetes, admission NIHSS score, and the number of stent retriever passes; imaging biomarkers like poor collaterals; and potential no-reflow biomarkers, notably disrupted blood-brain barrier (OR 4.321, 95% CI 1.794-10.405; p = 0.001), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR; OR 1.095, 95% CI 1.009-1.188; p = 0.030), and D-dimer (OR 1.134, 95% CI 1.017-1.266; p = 0.024). The model demonstrated high predictive accuracy, with a C-index of 0.901 (95% CI 0.855-0.947) and 0.911 (95% CI 0.863-0.954) in the original and bootstrapping validation samples, respectively. Notably, the comprehensive model showed significantly improved predictive performance over models that did not include no-reflow biomarkers, evidenced by an integrated discrimination improvement of 8.86% (95% CI 4.34%-13.39%; p < 0.001) and a categorized reclassification improvement of 18.38% (95% CI 3.53%-33.23%; p = 0.015). This model, which leverages the potential of no-reflow biomarkers, could be especially beneficial in healthcare settings with limited resources. It provides a valuable tool for predicting futile recanalization, thereby informing clinical decision-making. Future research could explore further refinements to this model and its application in diverse clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Iron is a fundamental metal involved in many cellular and biological processes in all organisms, humans included. Iron homeostasis is finely regulated both systemically and at the level of the Central Nervous System (CNS) to avoid its imbalance; indeed, iron excess is extremely toxic for cells and triggers detrimental oxidative stress increase. Nevertheless, factors such as genetics, environment, and aging can alter the normal iron metabolism leading to diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is the most widespread neurodegenerative disorder of the CNS. Although the precise pathogenesis of AD is not clarified yet, different studies conducted both in mouse models and in patients reported brain iron accumulation, resulting in cognitive, memory, and motor decline. Moreover, the expression of many proteins involved in iron metabolism appears to be altered in the brain, leading to iron deposition and promoting AD progression. In the context of AD, amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau hyperphosphorylation, the two hallmarks of the disease, can promote brain iron deposition and subsequent neuronal death. Indeed, although the mechanism of neuronal loss is not fully understood, several evidence demonstrated the involvement of the iron-dependent form of cell death defined as \"ferroptosis\". In this review, we deepened about the role of iron and iron deregulation in the CNS with a particular focus on its involvement in the pathogenesis of AD. We also discussed the potential role of ferroptosis as a new pathological mechanism related to dementia. Finally, we reviewed recent strategies for treating AD based on the use of iron chelators, antioxidants and ferroptosis inhibitors, paying close attention to iron disorders and the development of new drugs capable of preventing AD.",

    "abstract": "The increasing studies indicated that cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease (CAD), usually induce and exacerbate psychological problems, including anxiety and depression. These psychological issues are admitted as independent risk factors of heart disease as well. The interaction between CAD and anxiety and depression deteriorates the development and prognosis of CAD, which severely threatens the quality of life of patients. Although the existing mechanisms revealed the pathological relationship between CAD and anxiety and depression, there are few studies investigating the correlation between CAD and anxiety and depression from the aspect of gut microbiota (GM) and its metabolites. Therefore, in this review, we summarized whether GM and its metabolites are the emergent bridge between CAD and anxiety and depression. The results showed that there are four kinds of jointly up-regulated bacteria (i.e., Staphylococcus, Escherichia coli, Helicobacter pylori, and Shigella) and five kinds of jointly down-regulated bacteria (i.e., Prevotella, Lactobacillus, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Collinsella, and Bifidobacterium) in CAD as well as anxiety and depression. In addition, in CAD and anxiety and depression, the dysbiosis of the former four kinds of bacterium frequently leads to the outburst of inflammatory response, and the dysbiosis of the latter five kinds of bacterium is usually related to the metabolic abnormality of short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, and branched-chain amino acids. Therefore, we believe that GM and its metabolites act as the emergent bridge between CAD and anxiety and depression. The findings of this review provide novel insights and approaches for the clinical treatment of patients with both CAD and anxiety and depression.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an intricate neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins, including beta-amyloid (Aβ) and tau, leading to cognitive decline. Despite decades of research, the precise mechanisms underlying its onset and progression remain elusive. Cathepsins are a family of lysosomal enzymes that play vital roles in cellular processes, including protein degradation and regulation of immune responses. Emerging evidence suggests that cathepsins may be involved in AD pathogenesis. Cathepsins can influence the activation of microglia and astrocytes, the resident immune cells in the brain. However, cathepsin dysfunction may lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins, notably Aβ and tau. In addition, dysregulated cathepsin activity may induce an exaggerated immune response, promoting chronic inflammation and neuronal dysfunction in patients with AD. By unraveling the classification, functions, and roles of cathepsins in AD's pathogenesis, this review sheds light on their intricate involvement in this devastating disease. Targeting cathepsin activity could be a promising and novel approach for mitigating the pathological processes that contribute to AD, providing new avenues for its treatment and prevention.",

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent degenerative joint disease that significantly impacts the quality of life in the elderly. Traditional Chinese medicine, particularly Medicinal Cyathula Root and its active component Cyaonoside A (CyA), has been utilized to treat OA by promoting chondrocyte proliferation, inhibiting inflammatory factors, and maintaining joint homeostasis. Concurrently, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) derived from placental umbilical cord, bone marrow, and adipose tissue have gained attention for their potential in OA treatment due to their chondrogenic differentiation capabilities. This study explored the therapeutic synergy of CyA and MSC for enhanced cartilage regeneration. Optimal chondrogenic differentiation was achieved by treating MSC with 0.5 mg/mL CyA for 3 days, significantly increasing the expression of key cartilage-specific genes ACAN, COL2A, and SOX9. Comparative gene expression and pathway analyses revealed that CyA-induced MSC (C-MSC) modulate critical signaling pathways, including TGF-β, PI3K-Akt, and Wnt, demonstrating their potential in cartilage repair. Furthermore, C-MSC-derived exosomes exhibited superior anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects compared to MSC-derived exosomes in IL-1β-treated human chondrocytes, enhancing chondrogenic gene expression and reducing cartilage degradation. To enable targeted delivery, a novel injectable hydrogel system (HAMA@C-MSC) was developed using methylacrylated hyaluronic acid (HAMA). This hydrogel facilitated uniform cell distribution, maintained structural integrity, and demonstrated excellent biocompatibility and biosafety, with no cytotoxic or hemolytic effects. In vivo studies using a rat destabilization of the medial meniscus OA model confirmed that HAMA@C-MSC significantly improved cartilage structure, enhanced chondrocyte regeneration, and restored collagen integrity, outperforming other treatment groups as validated through imaging, histology, and molecular analyses. These findings highlight HAMA@C-MSC as a promising therapeutic strategy for OA, leveraging the synergistic effects of C-MSC and advanced hydrogel technology to achieve enhanced cartilage regeneration and joint protection.",

    "abstract": "Menopause is part of the aging process and is characterized by the natural cessation of menstruation; during this time, the production of ovarian hormones, especially estrogen, is sharply reduced. This reduction can cause symptoms and disorders that affect most women and can interfere with their quality of life. Women are also more susceptible to cardiovascular diseases during this period, considering that these ovarian hormones would be associated with a protective effect on the cardiovascular system, by acting at various levels, contributing to the body homeostasis. Among several effects on the cardiovascular system, the ovarian hormones seem to play an important role in the autonomic control of heart rate and blood pressure. A reduction in ovarian hormones causes an autonomic imbalance and increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases. In fact, this increased risk is justified by the key role the autonomic nervous system plays in all cardiac regulatory mechanisms, exerting a tonic and reflexive influence on the main variables of the cardiovascular system. The autonomic system controls various cardiovascular parameters, such as the modulation of heart rate and blood pressure, myocardial contractility and venous capacitance, directly participating in the regulation of cardiac output. Over the years, the standard treatment for menopause symptoms and disorders has been hormone replacement therapy (HRT). However, many studies have indicated the risks of HRT, which justify the need for new non-pharmacological therapies. To this end, physical training, mainly aerobic, has been applied with excellent results on the cardiovascular autonomic nervous system, as it reduces the risk of cardiac diseases and improves the survival rate with direct beneficial effects on the quality of life of these women during the aging process.",

In the present study, we analyzed an array of glycolytic and related enzymes and intermediates in RBCs from patients with AD and non-Alzheimer dementia (NA), age-matched controls (AC) and young adult controls (YC). AD is characterized by higher activities of hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and bisphosphoglycerate mutase and bisphosphoglycerate phosphatase in RBCs. In our study, we observed that glycolytic and related enzymes displayed significantly lower activities in AC. However, similar or significantly higher activities were observed in AD and NA groups as compared to YC group. 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) levels were significantly decreased in AD and NA patients. The pattern of changes between groups in the above indices strongly correlates with each other. Collectively, our data suggested that AD and NA patients are associated with chronic disturbance of 2,3-DPG metabolism in RBCs. These defects may play a pivotal role in physiological processes, which predispose elderly subjects to AD and NA.",

    "abstract": "Symptoms of depression are present in a significant proportion of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. While epidemiological studies have shown a strong association between depression and AD, it has not been established whether depression is a risk factor or merely a co-morbidity of AD. It is also uncertain if depression affects the pathogenesis of AD. In this paper, we address these questions by measuring the serum levels of two common metabolic risk factors of AD and depression, inflammatory cytokines (IL 6 and TNF alpha) and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, in a case-control study. We measured the serum levels of IL 6, TNF α and 25-hydroxyvitamin D in age-matched healthy controls (n= 60) and in AD patients without depression (n=26) or AD patients with depression (n=34), and statistically analyzed the changes in these parameters among different groups under this study. Our results show that in AD there is a significant increase in IL 6 and TNF α and a marked decrease in 25-hydroxyvitamin D in the peripheral circulation compared to age-matched healthy controls. Furthermore, AD patients with depression have even significantly higher levels of IL 6 or TNF α and a lower level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in circulation than in AD patients without depression. We also found a strong statistical correlation between the disease severity and the serum levels of IL 6, TNF α and 25-hydroxyvitamin D in AD patients with depression. These results suggest that altered circulating levels of common metabolic risk factors lead to the co-existence of depression with AD in many patients, and when they co-exist, the depression presumably affects the severity of AD presentations through more aggravated changes in these risk factors.",

DSS (600 mg/kg) was administered through the intragastric route at the time of reperfusion and then performed every day thereafter until sacrifice. Results showed that DSS treatment significantly improved neurobehavioral outcomes (N=10 per group, <i>P</i><0.05). Immunohistochemical staining showed that microvessel density in the perifocal region of DSS-treated rats was significantly increased compared to the saline-treated group (N=4 per group, <i>P</i><0.01). Similarly, the numbers of BrdU<sup>+</sup>/DCX<sup>+</sup> cells in the subventricular zone were increased in DSS-treated rats compared to the saline-treated group (<i>P</i><0.05). Furthermore, we demonstrated that DSS treatment activated vascular endothelial growth factor (N=4 per group,<i>P</i><0.05) and promoted eNOS phosphorylation (N=4 per group,<i>P</i><0.05). Thus, we concluded that DSS promoted focal angiogenesis and neurogenesis, and attenuated ischemia-induced brain injury in rats after MCAO, suggesting that DSS is a potential drug for ischemic stroke therapy.",

Our previous study has showed that TOPK has neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Here, we investigated the involvement of TOPK in microglia/ macrophage M1/M2 polarization and the underlying epigenetic mechanism. The expression profiles, co-localization and in vivo interaction of TOPK, M1/M2 surface markers, and HDAC1/HDAC2 were detected after middle cerebral artery occlusion models (MCAO). We demonstrated that TOPK, the M2 surface markers CD206 and Arg1, p-HDAC1, and p-HDAC2 showed a similar pattern of in vivo expression over time after MCAO. TOPK co-localized with CD206, p-HDAC1, and p-HDAC2 positive cells, and was shown to bind to HDAC1 and HDAC2. In vitro study showed that TOPK overexpression in BV2 cells up-regulated CD206 and Arg1, and promoted the phosphorylation of HDAC1 and HDAC2. In addition, TOPK overexpression also prevented LPS plus IFN-γ-induced M1 transformation through reducing release of inflammatory factor of M1 phenotype TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β, and increasing TGF-β release and the mRNA levels of TGF-β and SOCS3, cytokine of M2 phenotype and its regulator. Moreover, the increased TNF-α induced by TOPK siRNA could be reversed by HDAC1/HDAC2 inhibitor, FK228. TOPK overexpression increased M2 marker expression in vivo concomitant with the amelioration of cerebral injury, neurological functions deficits, whereas TOPK silencing had the opposite effects, which were completely reversed by the FK228 and partially by the SAHA. These findings suggest that TOPK positively regulates microglia/macrophage M2 polarization by inhibiting HDAC1/HDAC2 activity, which may contribute to its neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.",

In particular, while in OP patients we observed a significant reduction of VDR positive myonuclei with age, no \"age effect\" was observed in OA patients. The frequent activation of VDR could explain the lower number of atrophic fiber that we observed in OA patients respect to OP.

A cross-sectional study was performed to compare CMRGlc in normal subjects vs. VP and PD patients. Twelve normal subjects, 22 VP, and 11 PD patients were evaluated with the H&Y and MMSE, and underwent 18F-FDG measurements. Pearson’s correlations were used to identify potential associations between the severity of VP/PD and CMRGlc. A pronounced reduction of CMRGlc in the frontal lobe and caudate putamen was detected in patients with VP and PD when compared with normal subjects. The VP patients displayed a slight CMRGlc decrease in the caudate putamen and frontal lobe in comparison with PD patients. These decreases in CMRGlc in the frontal lobe and caudate putamen were significantly correlated with the VP patients’ H&Y, UPDRS II, UPDRS III, MMSE, cardiovascular, and attention/memory scores. Similarly, significant correlations were observed in patients with PD. This is the first clinical study finding strong evidence for an association between low cerebral glucose metabolism and the severity of VP and PD. Our findings suggest that these changes in glucose metabolism in the frontal lobe and caudate putamen may underlie the pathophysiological mechanisms of VP and PD. As the scramble to find imaging biomarkers or predictors of the disease intensifies, a better understanding of the roles of cerebral glucose metabolism may give us insight into the pathogenesis of VP and PD.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress and iron accumulation are tightly associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondrial ferritin (FtMt) is identified as an iron-storage protein located in the mitochondria, and its role in regulation of iron hemeostasis in neurodegenerative diseases has been reported. However, the role of FtMt in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress and iron accumulation in neuronal cells has not been studied. Here, we overexpressed FtMt in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and induced oxidative stress by treating with extracellular H2O2. We found that overexpression of FtMt significantly prevented cell death induced by H2O2, particularly the apoptosis-dependent cell death. The protective effects involved inhibiting the generation of cellular reactive oxygen species, sustaining mitochondrial membrane potential, maintaining the level of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, and inhibiting the activation of pro-apoptotic protein caspase 3. We further explored the mechanism of these protective effects and found that FtMt expression markedly altered iron homeostasis of the H2O2 treated cells as compared to that of controls. The FtMt overexpression significantly reduced cellular labile iron pool (LIP) and protected H2O2-induced elevation on LIP. While in H2O2 treated SH-SY5Y cells, the increased iron uptake and reduced iron release, in correlation with levels of DMT1(-IRE) and ferroportin 1, resulted in heavy iron accumulation, the FtMt overexpressing cells didn't show any significant changes in levels of iron transport proteins and in the level of LIP. These results implicate a neuroprotective role of FtMt on H2O2-induced oxidative stress, which may provide insights into the treatment of iron accumulation associated neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, multifactorial disease involving many pathological mechanisms. Nonetheless, single pathogenic mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) or presenilin 1 or 2 can cause AD with almost all of the clinical and neuropathological features, and therefore, we believe an important mechanism of pathogenesis in AD could be revealed from examining pathogenic APP missense mutations. A comprehensive review of the literature, including clinical, neuropathological, cellular and animal model data, was conducted through PubMed and the databases of Alzforum mutations, HGMD, UniProt, and AD&FTDMDB. Pearson correlation analysis combining the clinical and neuropathological data and aspects of mutant APP processing in cellular models was performed. We find that an increase in Aβ42 has a significant positive correlation with the appearance of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and tends to cause an earlier age of AD onset, while an increase in Aβ40 significantly increases the age at death. The increase in the α-carboxyl terminal fragment (CTF) has a significantly negative correlation with the age of AD onset, and β-CTF has a similar effect without statistical significance. Animal models show that intracellular Aβ is critical for memory defects. Based on these results and the fact that amyloid plaque burden correlates much less well with cognitive impairment than do NFT counts, we propose a \"snowball hypothesis\": the accumulation of intraneuronal NFTs caused by extracellular Aβ42 and the increase in intraneuronal APP proteolytic products (CTFs and Aβs) could cause cellular organelle stress that leads to neurodegeneration in AD, which then resembles the formation of abnormal protein \"snowballs\" both inside and outside of neurons.",

General demographics was collected from all participants followed by MRI scan, biochemical examinations and a series of neuropsychological tests. Student's t test, multiple regressions and one-way ANOVA were applied to investigate the differences between groups. Comparing diabetic patients with non-diabetic subjects in the mild cognitive impaired group, we found several decreased items in recall of three words in MMSE (p=0.020), AVLT and SCWT (p<0.050). The multiple linear regression revealed that two-hour glucose level (B= -0.255, p<0.001) and fasting C-peptide (B= -0.466, p=0.001) had negative effects on the score of MMSE. In addition, diabetic patients treated with insulin and other diabetes medication performed better in part of the AVLT (p<0.050) compared to patients with insulin treatment or oral antidiabetic medication only. Patients with metformin medication had a better memory outcome compared to patients with sulphonylurea medication in the AVLT long delay free recall (p =0.010). These findings show that patients of mild cognitive impairment with diabetes mellitus have a worse outcome in attention, information processing speed and memory compared to non-diabetic patients. Higher two-hour glucose level and C-peptide level may be risk factors for severe cognitive impairment in type-2 diabetes mellitus patients. The results of this study also suggest that medication may have effects on cognitive function.",

The purpose of this study was to further explore the clinical significance of miR-424 in peripheral immune cells of patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Blood samples were collected from 40 patients within 6 hours of symptom onset and 27 control subjects. MiR-424 levels in lymphocytes, neutrophils and plasma were determined by quantitative realtime-PCR. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of miR-424 for stroke was evaluated by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve. The correlation between miR-424 levels and clinical data was analyzed using Pearson's correlation test. Plasma levels of inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-10) and neurotrophic factor (IGF-1) were detected by ELISA. Notably, miR-424 expression levels in lymphocytes and neutrophils increased after stroke, suggestive of its diagnostic value in ischemic stroke. MiR-424 levels in neutrophils were negatively correlated with infarct volume. Lymphocytic miR-424 levels were negatively correlated with the number of lymphocytes and the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase CDK6. Moreover, plasma TNF-α and IGF-1 levels increased and decreased, respectively, in stroke patients, and miR-424 levels in lymphocytes and neutrophils were both inversely correlated with plasma TNF-α, IL-10, or IGF-1 levels. In summary, miR-424 levels in peripheral immune cells has diagnostic potential for ischemic stroke, and might affect the severity of acute stroke by depressing the peripheral inflammatory response through CDK6-dependent pathway in lymphocytes or CDK6-independent pathway neutrophils.",

    "abstract": "Aging is characterized by a progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and function (sarcopenia). Obesity exacerbates age-related decline and lead to frailty. Skeletal muscle fat infiltration increases with aging and seems to be crucial for the progression of sarcopenia. Additionally, skeletal muscle plasticity modulates metabolic adaptation to different pathophysiological situations. Thus, cellular bioenergetics and mitochondrial profile were studied in the skeletal muscle of overweight aged people without reaching obesity to prevent this extreme situation. Overweight aged muscle lacked ATP production, as indicated by defects in the phosphagen system, glycolysis and especially mostly by oxidative phosphorylation metabolic pathway. Overweight subjects exhibited an inhibition of mitophagy that was linked to an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis that underlies the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria and encourages the onset of sarcopenia. As a strategy to maintain cellular homeostasis, overweight subjects experienced a metabolic switch from oxidative to lactic acid fermentation metabolism, which allows continued ATP production under mitochondrial dysfunction, but without reaching physiological aged basal levels. This ATP depletion induced early signs of impaired contractile function and a decline in skeletal muscle structural integrity, evidenced by lower levels of filamin C. Our findings reveal the main effector pathways at an early stage of obesity and highlight the importance of mitochondrial metabolism in overweight and obese individuals. Exploiting mitochondrial profiles for therapeutic purposes in humans is an ambitious strategy for treating muscle impairment diseases.",

It has a neuroprotective role on neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we hypothesized that autophagy may also have a neuroprotective role in diabetes-associated cognitive decline (DACD). In current study, we found that db/db mice display cognitive decline with inferior learning and memory function. The accumulation of β-amyloid<sub>1-42</sub> (Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>), which is a characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD), was markedly higher in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), cornu ammon1 (CA1), and dentate gyrus (DG) areas of the hippocampus in db/db mice. Moreover, BDNF and microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2) levels were lower in the hippocampus of db/db mice. However, there was no noticeable differences in the level of apoptosis in the hippocampus between control (CON) mice and db/db mice. Markers of autophagy in the hippocampus were elevated in db/db mice. The expression levels of ATG5, ATG7, and LC3B were higher, and the level of P62 was lower. An autophagy inhibitor, 3-MA, and ATG7 siRNA significantly reversed the activation of autophagy <i>in vitro</i>, which was accompanied with a higher level of apoptosis. Taken together, our current study suggests that diabetes is associated with cognitive decline, and activation of autophagy has a neuroprotective role in DACD.",

SAMP8 mouse model presents accelerated senescence and has been identified as a model of gerontological research. SAMP8 displays a progressive age-related decline in brain function associated with a progressive hearing loss mimicking human aging memory deficits and ARHL. The molecular mechanisms associated with SAMP8 senescence process involve oxidative stress leading to chronic inflammation and apoptosis. Here, we studied the effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant, on SAMP8 hearing loss and memory to determine the potential interest of this model in the study of new antioxidant therapies. We observed a strong decrease of auditory brainstem response thresholds from 45 to 75 days of age and an increase of distortion product amplitudes from 60 to 75 days in NAC treated group compared to vehicle. Moreover, NAC treated group presented also an increase of memory performance at 60 and 105 days of age. These results confirm that NAC delays the senescence process by slowing the age-related hearing loss, protecting the cochlear hair cells and improving memory, suggesting that antioxidants could be a pharmacological target for age-related hearing and memory loss.",

In addition, the risk factors for the distribution pattern were illustrated. From June 2015 to May 2016, 9,346 patients with ischemic stroke from 20 hospitals were enrolled. Carotid artery ultrasonography and transcranial color-coded sonography/transcranial Doppler were used to evaluate the extracranial and intracranial arteries. The distribution pattern of atherosclerotic stenosis and its trend with aging were analyzed. Logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors for the distribution pattern. Among the 9,346 patients, 2,882 patients (30.8%) had at least one artery with a degree of stenosis ≥50%. Among patients with arterial stenosis, the proportion of patients with intracranial artery stenosis was higher than those with extracranial artery stenosis (52.6% <i>vs.</i> 27.6%), and the proportion of anterior circulation artery stenosis was higher than that in the posterior circulation (52.2% <i>vs.</i>26.2%). With aging, the proportion of intracranial artery stenosis alone decreased; at the same time, the proportion of extracranial artery stenosis and extracranial plus intracranial artery stenosis increased (trend χ<sup>2</sup>=6.698, <i>P</i>=0.001). Hypertension (OR 1.416, <i>P</i>=0.008) and family history of stroke (OR 1.479, <i>P</i>=0.014) were risk factors for intracranial artery stenosis. Male, aging, and smoking were factors more related to extracranial artery stenosis. Aging (OR 1.022, <i>P</i><0.001) and hypertension (OR 1.392, <i>P</i>=0.019) were related to posterior circulation artery stenosis. Intracranial arteries and anterior circulation arteries were susceptible to stenosis in Chinese patients with ischemic stroke. However, the distribution pattern of atherosclerotic stenosis was dynamic and varied with aging. Aging and different risk factors contribute to this distribution pattern.",

    "abstract": "Neuroglia is an umbrella term indicating different cellular types that play a pivotal role in the brain, being involved in its development and functional homeostasis. Glial cells are becoming the focus of recent researches pertaining the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in particular. In fact, activated microglia is the main determinant of neuroinflammation, contributing to neurodegeneration. In addition, the oxidative insult occurring during pathological brain aging can activate glial cells that, in turn, can favor the production of free radicals. Moreover, the recent Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK-3) hypothesis of AD suggests that GSK3, involved in the regulation of glial cells functioning, could exert a role in amyloid deposition and tau hyper-phosphorylation. In this review, we briefly describe the main physiological functions of the glial cells and discuss the link between neuroglia and the most studied molecular bases of AD. In addition, we dedicate a section to the glial changes occurring in AD, with particular attention to their role in terms of neurodegeneration. In the light of the literature data, neuroglia could play a fundamental role in AD pathogenesis and progression. Further studies are needed to shed light on this topic.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms that underlie the pathophysiology of aging, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and stroke are not fully understood and have been the focus of intense and constant investigation worldwide. Studies that provide insights on aging and age-related disease mechanisms are critical for advancing novel therapies that promote successful aging and prevent or cure multiple age-related diseases. The April 2019 issue of the journal, \"Aging & Disease\" published a series of articles that confer fresh insights on numerous age-related conditions and diseases. The age-related topics include the detrimental effect of overweight on energy metabolism and muscle integrity, senoinflammation as the cause of neuroinflammation, the link between systemic C-reactive protein and brain white matter loss, the role of miR-34a in promoting healthy heart and brain, the potential of sirtuin 3 for reducing cardiac and pulmonary fibrosis, and the promise of statin therapy for ameliorating asymptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis. Additional aging-related articles highlighted the involvement of miR-181b-5p and high mobility group box-1 in hypertension, Yes-associated protein in cataract formation, multiple miRs and long noncoding RNAs in coronary artery disease development, the role of higher meat consumption on sleep problems, and the link between glycated hemoglobin and depression. The topics related to ALS suggested that individuals with higher education and living in a rural environment have a higher risk for developing ALS, and collagen XIX alpha 1 is a prognostic biomarker of ALS. The topics discussed on AD implied that extracellular amyloid β42 is likely the cause of intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangle accumulation in familial AD and traditional oriental concoctions may be useful for slowing down the progression of AD. The article on stroke suggested that inhibition of the complement system is likely helpful in promoting brain repair after ischemic stroke. The significance of the above findings for understanding the pathogenesis in aging, ALS, AD, and stroke, slowing down the progression of aging, ALS and AD, and promoting brain repair after stroke are discussed.",

A total of 131 MSA patients were enrolled and followed up once every year until their deaths. Clinical information was collected by neurologists, and the cause of death of the MSA patients was obtained from the patients’ relatives or caregivers. The current study included 62 MSA with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P) and 69 MSA with predominant cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C) patients. Median survival time from disease onset to death of the MSA patients was 5.59 years. The most common cause of death was respiratory infection (65.6%). The second most common cause of death was sudden death (14.5%). Other causes included nutritional disorder due to dysphagia (9.2%), urinary tract infection (3.1%), suicide (2.3%), choking (1.5%), cerebrovascular accident (1.5%), myocardial infarction (1.5%), and lymphoma (0.8%). We found that sudden death was more likely to occur in patients with nocturnal stridor than in those without (P<0.001). There were no significant differences in the cause of death according to subtype, sex, or onset symptoms (autonomic failure or motor symptoms). Sudden death is a relatively common cause of death in MSA patients, second only to respiratory infection, especially in patients with nocturnal stridor. The information provided by our study may help to provide better medical care to MSA patients.",

Sixty patients with AD dementia, 37 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD and 30 healthy controls were consecutively recruited. Olfactory function was evaluated by self-report, HRS and Sniffin' Sticks test. Patients were divided into AD with OD (AD-OD) and AD with no OD (AD-NOD) groups based on the results of the Sniffin' Sticks test. Cognitive symptoms and neuropsychiatric symptoms were assessed by corresponding scales, and activities of daily living (ADL) were assessed by the ADL scale. In the control, MCI due to AD and AD dementia groups, the frequency of OD was 10.0%, 13.5% and 18.3%, respectively, by self-report; 6.7%, 24.3% and 48.3%, respectively, by HRS; and 3.3%, 13.5% and 65.0%, respectively, by the Sniffin' Sticks test. Compared to the results of the Sniffin' Sticks test, the diagnostic coincidence rates of OD by HRS in patients with MCI due to AD and AD dementia were 89.2% and 66.7%, respectively. Compared to the AD-NOD group, the scores of global cognition and memory, visuospatial ability and attention were all decreased (P<0.05), the apathy score was increased (P<0.05), and the ADL score was elevated (P<0.01). The frequency and accuracy of OD by self-report is relatively low. HRS can be used for screening olfaction in patients with MCI due to AD. The Sniffin' Sticks test can be used for validating OD in AD patients. AD-OD patients have severe impairments in global cognition and multiple cognitive domains of memory, visuospatial ability and attention, as well as neuropsychiatric symptoms of apathy, and thus have seriously compromised ADL.",

A cross-sectional study was carried out to explore the relationship among ApoE gene polymorphism, diabetes and cognition in non-demented aging Chinese adults. A total number of 1000 community dwellers aged 55 years and above were randomly recruited. Demographic information of the participants was collected using well designed self-administered questionnaires. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test was employed to evaluate the cognitive status of the participants. Semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to obtain the dietary intake information. Fasting venous blood samples were taken for ApoE genotyping and serum lipid measurements. 238 participants were type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients and 145 participants were <i>ApoE4</i> carriers. <i>ApoE 4</i>-T2DM subjects had higher serum triglyceride (TG) concentration than <i>E2</i> and <i>E3</i> carriers (<i>P</i> < 0.05). T2DM subjects carrying <i>ApoE4</i> had lower cognition than subjects with <i>E2</i> or <i>E3</i> carriers (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Comparing to non-type 2 diabetic mild cognitive impaired (nT2DM-MCI) subjects, the type 2 diabetic mild cognitive impaired (T2DM-MCI) subjects have higher serum glucose (Glu) level and lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) level (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The T2DM-MCI subjects carrying <i>ApoE4</i> have lower cognition than <i>E2</i> and <i>E3</i> carriers (<i>P</i> <0.05); and the interaction of <i>ApoE</i> genotype with T2DM was detected (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Our results indicated the association among ApoE gene polymorphism, T2DM and cognitive performance in non-demented aging population. The carrying of <i>ApoE4</i> predisposed the T2DM subjects and the T2DM-MCI subjects to have poor cognitive performance.

The central nervous system (CNS) is a sophisticated entity that takes charge of information reception, integration and response. Recently, accumulating evidence proposes that MST kinases are critical in the development of disease in different systems involving the CNS. In this review, we summarized the signal transduction pathways and interacting proteins of MST kinases. The potential biological function of each MST kinase and the commonly reported MST-related diseases in the neural system are also reviewed.

    "abstract": "Immune responses are a double-edged sword. Effective and appropriate immune responses capable of controlling viral infection while also largely preserving tissue integrity, are critical for host survival. Too strong immune responses might result in immune pathology, while too weak immune responses might cause viral persistence. Physiologic ageing is accompanied with a decline in the normal functioning of the immune system, which is termed as \"immunosenescence\". We show that aged mice (16-19 months old) are more resistant to influenza A virus (IAV) infection than the young mice. Strong immune responses in the young mice after IAV infection result in faster clearance of virus, but also cause severe lung injury and higher mortality rate. While in the aged mice, the delayed and milder immune responses contribute to reduced pulmonary damage, and are still capable to clear the infection even with a slower kinetics, displaying a more resistant phenotype during IAV infection. Hence, our work demonstrates that moderate immune responses as a decline with ageing in the aged mice balance the immune pathology and viral clearance, might be beneficial for the host during certain circumstances. Our results provide important insight to our basic knowledge of immunosenescence and immune defenses to invading pathogens. Further, our results indicate that age factors should be considered when investigating the vaccination and therapeutic strategies for severe IAV infection.",

This observational study was based on a single-center prospective registry study. AIS patients who underwent ET from January 2013 to February 2017 were recruited into this study. All patients had dual-energy CT (DECT) scan of the head at 12 to 24 hours post-ET. The primary outcome was the incidence of PICS. Secondary outcomes were total ICH, symptomatic ICH (sICH), 3-month functional outcome, and long-term functional outcome. One hundred and eighty patients were enrolled in this study. PICS was detected in 50 patients (28%) based on the post-interventional CT scan. We first used basic statistical analyses, showing that the incidence of both total ICH (60% vs. 25%, p<0.001) and sICH (18% vs. 8%, p=0.044) were higher in patients with PICS than those without, and fewer patients achieved no disability (mRS≤1) in the PICS group compared to the control group at both 3-month and long-term follow-up (p<0.01 each). However, multivariate regression analysis further revealed that PICS only increased total (adjusted odds ratio, 7.38; 95% confidence interval 1.66 to 32.9; p=0.009) but not sICH risk. Furthermore, the logistic regression analyses did not show statistical difference in good clinical outcomes or mortality between the two groups. PICS is a common phenomenon in Chinese AIS patients. It is associated with total ICH after ET, but it seems to have no effect on functional outcome and sICH. Further large-scale studies are warranted to validate these results.",

In this study, we show that Mib2 is involved in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced microglial activation. Mechanistically, Mib2 interacts with the IKK complex and regulates the activation of NF-κB signaling, thus modulating Notch1 transcription in the microglia. Furthermore, we generated a microglia-specific Mib2 knockout mice and found that microglia-specific deletion of Mib2 significantly alleviates ischemia-induced neuroinflammation and brain injury. Taken together, our results reveal a critical role of Mib2 in microglial activation and ischemia-induced brain injury, thus providing a potential target for the treatment of stroke.",

Using the reporter cell line (NKG2D-2B4) in which activation of the NKG2D receptor pathway results in GFP expression based on the stimulation of immobilized rMICA, we showed that the number of GFP-expressing cells decreased sharply in presence of sMICA. Upon adding sMICA, the release of cytokines IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-8 by NK cell line (NKL) under stimulation of immobilized rMICA was blocked. Using MICA-expressing cells as the target cells, we observed that about 80% of target cells were killed by NKL at E:T of 10:1, but in presence of sMICA<sup>high</sup> serum of HCC patients, the dead target cells were reduced to 30.8%. Compared in presence of sMICA<sup>low</sup> serum from HCC patients, there were 63.7% of target cells dead (p=0.043).

    "abstract": "Stroke is a leading cause of human death and disability, with around 30% of stroke patients develop neuropsychological/neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as post-stroke depression (PSD). Basic and translational research on post-stroke psychological disorders is limited. In a focal ischemic stroke mouse model with selective damage to the sensorimotor cortex, sensorimotor deficits develop soon after stroke and spontaneous recovery is observed in 2-4 weeks. We identified that mice subjected to a focal ischemic insult gradually developed depression/anxiety like behaviors 4 to 8 weeks after stroke. Psychological/psychiatric disorders were revealed in multiple behavioral examinations, including the forced swim, tail suspension, sucrose preference, and open field tests. Altered neuronal plasticity such as suppressed long-term potentiation (LTP), reduced BDNF and oxytocin signaling, and disturbed dopamine synthesis/uptake were detected in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during the chronic phase after stroke. Pharmacological hypothermia induced by the neurotensin receptor 1 (NTR1) agonist HPI-363 was applied as an acute treatment after stroke. A six-hr hypothermia treatment applied 45 min after stroke prevented depression and anxiety like behaviors examined at 6 weeks after stroke, as well as restored BDNF expression and oxytocin signaling. Additionally, hypothermia induced by physical cooling also showed an anti-depression and anti-anxiety effect. The data suggested a delayed beneficial effect of acute hypothermia treatment on chronically developed post-stroke neuropsychological disorders, associated with regulation of synaptic plasticity, neurotrophic factors, dopaminergic activity, and oxytocin signaling in the PFC.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) plays physiological roles in vascular tone regulation, cytoprotection, and ATP synthesis. HMG-CoA reductase degradation protein (Hrd1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is involved in protein trafficking. H<sub>2</sub>S may play a role in controlling fatty acid uptake in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) in a manner correlated with modulation of Hrd1 S-sulfhydration; however, this role remains to be elucidated. The aim of the present study was to examine whether H<sub>2</sub>S can attenuate lipid accumulation and to explain the possible mechanisms involved in the regulation of the H<sub>2</sub>S-Hrd1/VAMP3 pathway. Db/db mice and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes treated with high glucose, palmitate and oleate were used as animal and cellular models of type 2 diabetes, respectively. The expression of cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE), Hrd1, CD36 and VAMP3 was detected by Western blot analysis. In addition, Hrd1 was mutated at Cys115, and Hrd1 S-sulfhydration was examined using an S-sulfhydration assay. VAMP3 ubiquitylation was investigated by immunoprecipitation. Lipid droplet formation was tested by TEM, BODIPY 493/503 staining and oil red O staining. The expression of CSE and Hrd1 was decreased in db/db mice compared to control mice, whereas CD36 and VAMP3 expression was increased. NaHS administration reduced droplet formation, and exogenous H<sub>2</sub>S restored Hrd1 expression, modified S-sulfhydration, and decreased VAMP3 expression in the plasma membrane. Using LC-MS/MS analysis, we identified 85 proteins with decreased ubiquitylation, including 3 vesicle-associated membrane proteins, in the cardiac tissues of model db/db mice compared with NaHS-treated db/db mice. Overexpression of Hrd1 mutated at Cys115 diminished VAMP3 ubiquitylation, whereas it increased CD36 and VAMP3 expression and droplet formation. siRNA-mediated Hrd1 deletion increased the expression of CD36 in the cell membrane. These findings suggested that H<sub>2</sub>S regulates VAMP3 ubiquitylation via Hrd1 S-sulfhydration at Cys115 to prevent CD36 translocation in diabetes.",

    "abstract": "This population-based retrospective cohort study investigated dementia risk associated with acarbose in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by using Taiwan's National Health Insurance database. A cohort of 15,524 matched pairs of ever and never users of acarbose based on propensity score matching was enrolled from new-onset type 2 diabetes patients from 1999 to 2006. Patients who were alive on January 1, 2007, were followed up for dementia until December 31, 2011. Adjusted hazard ratios were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. The results revealed that the incident case numbers (incidence rates) of dementia were 264 (407.19 per 100,000 person-years) for never users and 231 (337.94 per 100,000 person-years) for ever users. The hazard ratio for ever users versus never users was 0.841 (95% confidence interval, 0.704-1.005) and 0.918 (0.845-0.998) for every 1-year increment of cumulative duration of acarbose therapy. Subgroup analyses showed that the reduced risk associated with acarbose was only observed in women (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.783; 95% confidence interval, 0.618-0.992) and in non-users of metformin (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.635; 95% confidence interval, 0.481-0.837). A model comparing different combinations of acarbose, metformin, and pioglitazone suggested that users of all three drugs had the lowest risk of dementia (hazard ratio, 0.406; 95% confidence interval, 0.178-0.925). In conclusion, reduced risk of dementia associated with acarbose is observed in the female sex and in non-users of metformin. Moreover, users of all three drugs (acarbose, metformin, and pioglitazone) have the lowest risk of dementia.",

    "abstract": "Aging is a complex biological process closely linked with the occurrence and development of age-related diseases. Despite recent advances in lifestyle management and drug therapy, the late diagnosis of these diseases causes severe complications, usually resulting in death and consequently impacting social economies. Therefore, the identification of reliable biomarkers and the creation of effective treatment alternatives for age-related diseases are needed. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel class of RNA molecules that form covalently closed loops capable of regulating gene expression at multiple levels. Several studies have reported the emerging functional roles of circRNAs in various conditions, providing new perspectives regarding cellular physiology and disease pathology. Notably, accumulating evidence demonstrates the involvement of circRNAs in the regulation of age-related pathologies, including cardio-cerebrovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, cancer, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis. Therefore, the association of circRNAs with these age-related pathologies highlights their potential as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for better disease management. Here, we review the biogenesis and function of circRNAs, with a special focus on their regulatory roles in aging-related pathologies, as well as discuss their potential as biological biomarkers and therapeutic targets for these diseases.",

    "abstract": "Many animal prototypes illustrating the various attributes of human temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) are available. These models have been invaluable for comprehending multiple epileptogenic processes, modifications in electrophysiological properties, neuronal hyperexcitability, neurodegeneration, neural plasticity, and chronic neuroinflammation in TLE. Some models have also uncovered the efficacy of new antiepileptic drugs or biologics for alleviating epileptogenesis, cognitive impairments, or spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS). Nonetheless, the suitability of these models for testing candidate therapeutics in conditions such as chronic TLE is debatable because of a lower frequency of SRS and an inconsistent pattern of SRS activity over days, weeks or months. An ideal prototype of chronic TLE for investigating novel therapeutics would need to display a large number of SRS with a dependable frequency and severity and related co-morbidities. This study presents a new kainic acid (KA) model of chronic TLE generated through induction of status epilepticus (SE) in 6-8 weeks old male F344 rats. A rigorous characterization in the chronic epilepsy period validated that the animal prototype mimicked the most salient features of robust chronic TLE. Animals displayed a constant frequency and intensity of SRS across weeks and months in the 5th and 6th month after SE, as well as cognitive and mood impairments. Moreover, SRS frequency displayed a rhythmic pattern with 24-hour periodicity and a consistently higher number of SRS in the daylight period. Besides, the model showed many neuropathological features of chronic TLE, which include a partial loss of inhibitory interneurons, reduced neurogenesis with persistent aberrant migration of newly born neurons, chronic neuroinflammation typified by hypertrophied astrocytes and rod-shaped microglia, and a significant aberrant mossy fiber sprouting in the hippocampus. This consistent chronic seizure model is ideal for investigating the efficacy of various antiepileptic drugs and biologics as well as understanding multiple pathophysiological mechanisms underlying chronic epilepsy.",

In recent years, OSAHS has been reported in not only constituting an aging-associated disease, but also in accelerating and/or potentiating aging mechanisms. However, the negative impacts of OSAHS on aging are underestimated because of low level of public awareness about this disease and high rates of undiagnosed cases, which are more critical in developing countries or economically disadvantaged regions. Hence, reviewing previously reported observations may assist scholars to better indicate that OSAHS is likely a novel potential risk for aging. Further understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism of OSAHS and its role in procession of aging may markedly highlight the importance of this common sleep disorder.",

    "abstract": "CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) is a severe neurodevelopmental disease caused by mutations in the X-linked CDKL5 gene. Children affected by CDD display a clinical phenotype characterized by early-onset epilepsy, intellectual disability, motor impairment, and autistic-like features. Although the clinical aspects associated with CDKL5 mutations are well described in children, adults with CDD are still under-characterized. Similarly, most animal research has been carried out on young adult Cdkl5 knockout (KO) mice only. Since age represents a risk factor for the worsening of symptoms in many neurodevelopmental disorders, understanding age differences in the development of behavioral deficits is crucial in order to optimize the impact of therapeutic interventions. Here, we compared young adult Cdkl5 KO mice with middle-aged Cdkl5 KO mice, at a behavioral, neuroanatomical, and molecular level. We found an age-dependent decline in motor, cognitive, and social behaviors in Cdkl5 KO mice, as well as in breathing and sleep patterns. The behavioral decline in older Cdkl5 KO mice was not associated with a worsening of neuroanatomical alterations, such as decreased dendritic arborization or spine density, but was paralleled by decreased neuronal survival in different brain regions such as the hippocampus, cortex, and basal ganglia. Interestingly, we found increased β-galactosidase activity and DNA repair protein levels, γH2AX and XRCC5, in the brains of older Cdkl5 KO mice, which suggests that an absence of Cdkl5 accelerates neuronal senescence/death by triggering irreparable DNA damage. In summary, this work provides evidence that CDKL5 may play a fundamental role in neuronal survival during brain aging and suggests a possible worsening with age of the clinical picture in CDD patients.",

    "abstract": "Ischemic-induced white matter injury is strongly correlated with the poor neurological outcomes in stroke patients. The transplantation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) is an effective candidate for enhancing re-myelination in congenitally dysmyelinated brain and spinal cord. Nevertheless, mechanisms governing the recovery of white matter and axon after OPCs transplantation are incompletely understood in ischemic stroke. In this study, OPCs were transplanted into the ischemic brain at 7 days after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). We observed improved behavior recovery and reduced brain atrophy volume at 28 days after OPCs transplantation. Moreover, our results identified that myelin sheath integrity and endogenous OPCs proliferation and migration were promoted after OPCs transplantation. By contrast, AMD3100, an antagonist of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4, eliminated the beneficial effects of OPCs transplantation on white matter integrity and endogenous oligodendrogenesis. In addition, the improvement of neurite growth and synaptogenesis after OPCs transplantation in ischemic brain or OPC co-cultured neurons, potentially through the upregulation of Netrin-1, was indicated by increased protein levels of synaptophysin and postsynaptic density protein 95. Knockdown of Deleted in Colorectal Carcinoma, a receptor of Netrin-1, prevented increased neurite growth and synaptogenesis in neurons co-cultured with OPCs. In conclusion, our studies suggested that engrafted OPCs promoted the recovery after ischemic stroke by enhancing endogenous oligodendrogenesis, neurite growth, and synaptogenesis; the last two being mediated by the Netrin-1/DCC axis.",

Some studies have reported that the pathology of PD originates from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which also serves as an energy portal, and develops upward along the neural pathway to the central nervous system (CNS), including the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus (DMV), SN, and hypothalamus, which are also involved in energy metabolism control. Therefore, we discuss the alterations of nuclei that regulate energy metabolism in the development of PD. In addition, due to their anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic and antioxidative roles, metabolism-related peptides are involved in the progression of PD. Furthermore, abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism are common in PD patients and exacerbate the pathological changes in PD. Therefore, in this review, we attempt to explain the correlation between PD and energy metabolism, which may provide possible strategies for PD treatment.",

This study assessed the possible roles of metabolic/obesity phenotypes and vitamin D status in increasing the greater severity of COVID-19. We studied 353,299 UK Biobank participants from England with a mean age of 67.7 years. Metabolic/obesity phenotypes were defined as a combination of metabolic components (hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes) and obesity. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to test whether the addition of metabolic disorders and vitamin D insufficiency increased obesity associations with COVID-19 hospitalization, confirmed COVID-19, and severe COVID-19. Metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUHO) represented 12.3% of the total analytic samples, and 21.5%, 18.5%, and 19.8% of the included subpopulations with COVID-19 hospitalization, confirmed COVID-19, and severe COVID-19, respectively. Vitamin D insufficiency phenotypes represented 53.5% of the total analytic samples, and 59.5%, 61.7%, and 61.5% of the included subpopulations with COVID-19 hospitalization, confirmed COVID-19, and severe COVID-19, respectively. In multivariate logistic regression, MUHO and vitamin D insufficiency and their combination were significantly associated with COVID-19 illness severity (odds ratio [OR] for COVID-19 hospitalization = 2.33, 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.02-2.70; OR for confirmed COVID-19 = 2.06, 95% CI, 1.58-2.70; OR for severe COVID-19 = 2.06, 95% CI, 1.47-2.87).

Our findings showed that MUHO and vitamin D insufficiency are associated with a significantly increased risk of COVID-19 severity, especially for adults 65 years and older.

    "abstract": "The vegetative state (VS) and minimally conscious state (MCS) are two major types of chronic disorders of consciousness (DoC). The assessment of these two consciousness states generally relies on the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) score, but a high misdiagnosis rate limits the generalized use of this score. To identify metabolites in human plasma that can accurately distinguish VS from MCS patients, comprehensive plasma metabolic profiles were obtained with targeted metabolomics analysis and untargeted and targeted lipidomics analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the significance of differences. Compared with healthy controls (HCs), the DoC groups, Emerged from Minimally Conscious State (EMCS) group and Alzheimer's disease (AD) group had significantly different metabolic profiles. Purine metabolism pathway differed the most between the DoC (MCS and VS) and HC groups. In this pathway, adenosine, ADP, and AMP, which are the derived products of ATP degradation, were decreased in the MCS and VS groups compared to healthy controls. More importantly, we identified certain lipids for which the levels were enriched in the VS or MCS groups. Specifically, phosphatidylcholine, (38:5)-H (PC(38:5)-H), and arachidonic acid (AA) differed substantially between the VS and MCS groups and may be used to distinguish these two groups of patients. Together, our findings suggest that metabolic profiling is significantly altered in patients with chronic DoC.",

    "abstract": "While opiates like morphine play a major role in the pharmacotherapy for the control of pain associated with various diseases, paradoxically, their long-term use is associated with cognitive impairments.Furthermore, morphine administration has been shown to result in neuronal synaptodendritic injury in rodent brains, leading to neurodegeneration.We recently reported the role of astrocytes as contributors of amyloidosis associated with HIV-associated neurological disorders.Herein we hypothesize that morphine could induce astrocytic amyloidosis, which, in turn, could be disseminated to various regions in the brain by astrocyte-derived EVs (ADEVs).In this study we demonstrate brain region-specific up-regulation of astrocytic amyloids in morphine dependendent rhesus macaques.In addition, herein we also demonstrate increased expression of β-site cleaving enzyme (BACE1), APP, and Aβ in human primary astrocytes (HPAs) exposed to morphine.Mechanisms involved in this process included the up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α), its translocation and binding to the promoter of BACE1, leading to increased BACE1 activity and, generation of Aβ 1-42.Gene silencing approaches confirmed the regulatory role of HIF-1α in BACE1 mediated amyloidosis leading to astrocyte activation and neuroinflammation.We next sought to assess whether morphine-stimulated ADEVs could carry amyloid cargoes.Results showed that morphine exposure induced the release of morphine-ADEVs, carrying amyloids.Interestingly, silencing HIF-1α in astrocytes not only reduced the numbers of ADEV released, but also the packaging of amyloid cargos in the ADEVs.These findings were further validated in brain derived EVs (BEVs) isolated from macaques, wherein it was shown that BEVs from morphine-dependent macaques, carried varieties of amyloid cargoes including the cytokine IL-1β.This is the first report implicating the role of HIF-1α-BACE1 axis in morphine-mediated induction of astrocytic amyloidosis, leading, in turn, to neuroinflammation and release of the amyloid cargoes via ADEVs.These findings set the groundwork for the future development of therapeutic strategies for targeting cognitive deficits in chronic opiate users.

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by multiple demyelinating lesions in the spinal cord and brain.Neuronal disruption caused by myelin loss or demyelination, which may accompany axonal changes, leads to multiple neurological symptoms.They may transiently appear for weeks during periods of disease worsening (relapse) in relapsingremitting form of MS (RRMS).Although a number of genetic, metabolic and environmental factors influencing the development of MS have been identified, the precise mechanisms involved in the CNS tissue damage in MS are still poorly understood.Recent studies have revealed a significant role of circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) in many diseases.EVs are known to serve as a cellular communication tool between two cell types either in close proximity or in different parts of the body.During the recent development in understanding of the pathogenesis of MS, studies have revealed the possible role of EVs in MS.Furthermore, circulating EVs can be used as a biomarker for monitoring disease progression and activity of MS, and they can also be therapeutic reagents or targets of therapy.In this review we overview and discuss in detail about generation of EVs and their diversified roles in MS.",

    "abstract": "Reflex seizures (RS) are epileptic events that are objectively and consistently elicited in response to a specific afferent stimulus or by an activity of the patient. The specific stimulus can be a variety of heterogenous intrinsic or extrinsic factors, ranging from the simple to the complex, such as flashing lights or reading a book. These seizures can take a variety of forms, comprising either general or focal onset, with or without secondary generalization. Reflex epilepsies (RE) are classified as a specific syndrome in which all epileptic seizures are precipitated by sensory stimuli. The few designated RE include idiopathic photosensitive occipital lobe epilepsy, other visual sensitive epilepsies, primary reading epilepsy, and startle epilepsy. RS that occurs within other focal or generalized epilepsy syndromes that are associated with distinct spontaneous seizures are classified by the overarching seizure type. Most patients experience spontaneous seizures along with their provoked events. RS originate from stimulation of functional anatomic networks normally functioning for physiological activities, that overlap or coincide with regions of cortical hyperexcitability. Generalized RS typically occur within the setting of IGEs and should be considered as focal seizures with quick secondary generalization via cortico-cortical or cortico-reticular pathways. In aggregate, activation of a critical neuronal mass, supported and sustained by cortico-subcortical and thalamocortical pathways eventually result in a seizure. Treatment includes antiseizure medication, commonly valproate or levetiracetam, along with lifestyle modifications, and when amenable, surgical intervention. High clinical suspicion and careful history taking must be employed in all epilepsy patients to identify reflex triggers.",

    "abstract": "In keeping with its status as one of the major causes of disability and mortality worldwide, brain damage induced by cerebral arterial disease has been the subject of several decades of scientific investigation, which has resulted in a vastly improved understanding of its pathogenesis.Brain injury mediated by venous etiologies, however, such as cerebral, jugular, and vertebral venous outflow disturbance, have been largely ignored by clinicians.Unfortunately, this inattention is not proportional to the severity of cerebral venous diseases, as the impact they exact on the quality of life of affected patients may be no less than that of arterial diseases.This is evident in disease sequelae such as cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT)-mediated visual impairment, epilepsy, and intracranial hypertension; and the long-term unbearable head noise, tinnitus, headache, dizziness, sleeping disorder, and even severe intracranial hypertension induced by non-thrombotic cerebral venous sinus (CVS) stenosis and/or internal jugular venous (IJV) stenosis.In addition, the vertebral venous system (VVS), a large volume, valveless vascular network that stretches from the brain to the pelvis, provides a conduit for diffuse transmission of tumors, infections, or emboli, with potentially devastating clinical consequences.Moreover, the lack of specific features and focal neurologic signs seen with arterial etiologies render cerebral venous disease prone to both to misdiagnoses and missed diagnoses.It is therefore imperative that awareness be raised, and that as comprehensive an understanding as possible of these issues be cultivated.In this review, we attempt to facilitate these goals by systematically summarizing recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of these entities, including CVT, CVS stenosis, and IJV stenosis, with the aim of providing a valid, practical reference for clinicians.",

    "abstract": "Though disciplines in the same field, modern medicine (Western medicine) and traditional medicine (Traditional Chinese medicine, TCM) have been viewed as two distinct and divergent fields of medicine and thus differ greatly in their ways of diagnosing, treating, and preventing disease. In brief, Western medicine is primarily an evidence (laboratory)-based science, whereas TCM is more of a healing art based on the theory of Yin and Yang and the five elements in the human body. Therefore, whether TCM and Western medicine could use similar philosophical approaches to treat disease remains unclear. It is well-known that vitamin D enhances immune function and reduces the spread of some viruses. Indeed, recent evidence shows that the blood calcium level is strongly associated with COVID-19 severity, and vitamin D supplementation has shown favorable effects in viral infections. According to TCM theory, the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is closely associated with cold-dampness, an etiological factor in TCM. Cold-dampness could be attenuated by sun exposure and Wenyang herbs, both of which can restore the vitamin D level in the blood in Western medicine. Therefore, TCM and Western medicine could share similar philosophical methods to fight COVID-19 and understanding their philosophical theories could achieve the maximum benefits for treatment of COVID-19 and other diseases.",

The cytosolic DNA sensor cyclic-GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and its downstream effector, stimulator of interferon genes (STING), mediate innate immune signaling by promoting the release of type I interferons (IFNs) and other inflammatory cytokines. These biomolecules are suggested to play critical roles in host defense, senescence, and tumor immunity. Recent studies have demonstrated that cGAS-STING signaling is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of central nervous system (CNS) diseases which are underscored by neuroinflammatory-driven disease progression. Understanding and regulating the interactions between cGAS-STING signaling and the nervous system may thus provide an effective approach to prevent or delay late-onset CNS disorders.

DL-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP), a synthesized compound based on an extract from seeds of celery Apium graveolens Linn, has been used as a therapeutic drug, showing multiple neuroprotective and regenerative activities. A potential effect of NBP on collateral arterial regulation is unknown. We examined the effects of NBP on arteriogenesis of collateral arteries in vitro and a mouse ischemic stroke model. In cultures of mouse iPS cell-derived vascular progenitors, NBP (10 μM) significantly increased α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA)/CD-31 co-labeled cells and the expression of newly formed vasculature marker PDGFRα. A sensorimotor cortex ischemia was induced in transgenic mice expressing αSMA-GFP that allowed direct observation of arterial vasculatures in brain regions. NBP (80 mg/kg) was intranasally delivered 1 hr after stroke and once daily for 14 days. To label proliferating cells, 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU, 50 mg/kg, i.p.) was administrated every day from 3 days after stroke. Western blotting of peri-infarct tissue detected increased expressions of VEGF, Ang-1 and reduced nNOS level in NBP-treated mice. The NBP treatment significantly increased αSMA/BrdU co-labeled cells, the diameter of ipsilateral collaterals, and arterial area in ischemic and peri-infarct regions examined 14 days after stroke. Examined 3 days after stroke, NBP prevented functional deficits in the cylinder test and corner test. The NBP treatment of 14 days improved the local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) and functional performance in multiple tests. Thus, NBP promotes collateriogenesis, short and long-term structural and functional improvements after ischemic stroke.",

Many risk prediction models for OF have been developed, but their performance and methodological quality are unclear. We conducted this systematic review to summarize and critically appraise the OF risk prediction models. Three databases were searched until April 2021. Studies developing or validating multivariable models for OF risk prediction were considered eligible. Used the prediction model risk of bias assessment tool to appraise the risk of bias and applicability of included models. All results were narratively summarized and described. A total of 68 studies describing 70 newly developed prediction models and 138 external validations were included. Most models were explicitly developed (n=31, 44%) and validated (n=76, 55%) only for female. Only 22 developed models (31%) were externally validated. The most validated tool was Fracture Risk Assessment Tool. Overall, only a few models showed outstanding (n=3, 1%) or excellent (n=32, 15%) prediction discrimination. Calibration of developed models (n=25, 36%) or external validation models (n=33, 24%) were rarely assessed. No model was rated as low risk of bias, mostly because of an insufficient number of cases and inappropriate assessment of calibration. There are a certain number of OF risk prediction models. However, few models have been thoroughly internally validated or externally validated (with calibration being unassessed for most of the models), and all models showed methodological shortcomings. Instead of developing completely new models, future research is suggested to validate, improve, and analyze the impact of existing models.",

Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the core factors that damage structure and function in COPD skeletal muscle and is closely related to smoke exposure, hypoxia, and insufficient physical activity. The currently known phenotypes of mitochondrial dysfunction are reduced mitochondrial content and biogenesis, impaired activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, and increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production. Significant progress has been made in research on physical therapy (PT), which has broad prospects for treating the abovementioned potential mitochondrial-function changes in COPD skeletal muscle. In terms of specific types of PT, exercise therapy can directly act on mitochondria and improve COPD SMD by increasing mitochondrial density, regulating mitochondrial biogenesis, upregulating mitochondrial respiratory function, and reducing oxidative stress. However, improvements in mitochondrial-dysfunction phenotype in COPD skeletal muscle due to different exercise strategies are not entirely consistent. Therefore, based on the elucidation of this phenotype, in this study, we analyzed the effect of exercise on mitochondrial dysfunction in COPD skeletal muscle and the regulatory mechanism thereof. We also provided a theoretical basis for exercise programs to rehabilitate this condition.",

Exercise has been identified as a factor that improves those conditions. The aim of this review is to synthetize and analyze the results of exercise interventions on muscle mass, fat mass, bone mass, strength and physical performance in community dwelling older adults (OA). A systematic search was carried out in eleven databases, using validated terms as \"aged\", \"exercise\" and others. For the meta-analysis, we differentiated by type of exercise and outcome. Twenty-nine randomized clinical trials were obtained for the review and 24 clinical trials for meta-analysis. This study identified an increase of 1.0 kg (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.3 -1.7) in total muscle mass (TMM) and 0.4 kg (95%CI 0.0,0.7) in appendicular muscle mass (AMM); a decrease of -3.7 kg (95% CI -5.8, -1.5) in total fat mass and -3.7% (95%CI -5.8, -1.5) in fat percentage after the resistance exercise intervention by 2-3 times per week. A -3.0% (95%CI -4.6, -1.3) decrease was observed in fat percentage after the aerobic exercise intervention. The quality of the evidence was ranked from high to very low; the risk of bias most common was performance bias and other bias. This study suggests that resistance exercise is the intervention that shows a positive effect on muscle fat mass, and bone mass. More research is needed for other exercise interventions.",

The brain can be protected from stress injury by remodeling the microcirculation network. Angiogenesis is a type of cerebral vascular remodeling. It is an effective approach to improve the blood flow of the cerebral microcirculation, which is necessary for preventing and treating various neurological disorders. Hypoxia is one of the most important regulators of angiogenesis, affecting the sprouting, proliferation, and maturation stages of angiogenesis. Moreover, hypoxia negatively affects cerebral vascular tissue by impairing the structural and functional integrity of the blood-brain barrier and vascular-nerve decoupling. Therefore, hypoxia has a dual effect on blood vessels and is affected by confounding factors including oxygen concentration, hypoxia duration, and hypoxia frequency and extent. Establishing an optimal model that promotes cerebral microvasculogenesis without causing vascular injury is essential. In this review, we first elaborate on the effects of hypoxia on blood vessels from two different perspectives: (1) the promotion of angiogenesis and (2) cerebral microcirculation damage. We further discuss the factors influencing the dual role of hypoxia and emphasize the benefits of moderate hypoxic irritation and its potential application as an easy, safe, and effective treatment for multiple nervous system disorders.",

Due to the crucial role of cytokines in the process of intervertebral disc degeneration, we hypothesized that elevation of these cytokines in plasma of diabetic patients may be involved in the process of diabetes-induced IVDD. In this review, changes in plasma cytokine levels in diabetic patients were summarized and the potential role of elevated cytokines in diabetes-induced IVDD was discussed. Results showed that some cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β may accelerate the development of IVDD, while others such as IL-10 is supposed to prevent its development. Apoptosis, senescence, and extracellular matrix metabolism were found to be regulated by these cytokines in IVDD. Further studies are required to validate the cytokines targeted strategy for diabetic IVDD therapy.",

Any alteration to these networks results in the disturbance of cellular homeostasis and induces cells towards different fates. Myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A) is one of four members of the MEF2 family of transcription factors (MEF2A-D). MEF2A is highly expressed in all tissues and is involved in many cell regulatory networks including growth, differentiation, survival and death. It is also necessary for heart development, myogenesis, neuronal development and differentiation. In addition, many other important functions of MEF2A have been reported. Recent studies have shown that MEF2A can regulate different, and sometimes even mutually exclusive cellular events. How MEF2A regulates opposing cellular life processes is an interesting topic and worthy of further exploration. Here, we reviewed almost all MEF2A research papers published in English and summarized them into three main sections: 1) the association of genetic variants in MEF2A with cardiovascular disease, 2) the physiopathological functions of MEF2A, and 3) the regulation of MEF2A activity and its regulatory targets. In summary, multiple regulatory patterns for MEF2A activity and a variety of co-factors cause its transcriptional activity to switch to different target genes, thereby regulating opposing cell life processes. The association of MEF2A with numerous signaling molecules establishes a central role for MEF2A in the regulatory network of cellular physiopathology.",

    "abstract": "Optogenetics has been used to regulate astrocyte activity and modulate neuronal function after brain injury. Activated astrocytes regulate blood-brain barrier functions and are thereby involved in brain repair. However, the effect and molecular mechanism of optogenetic-activated astrocytes on the change in barrier function in ischemic stroke remain obscure. In this study, adult male GFAP-ChR2-EYFP transgenic Sprague-Dawley rats were stimulated by optogenetics at 24, 36, 48, and 60 h after photothrombotic stroke to activate ipsilateral cortical astrocytes. The effects of activated astrocytes on barrier integrity and the underlying mechanisms were explored using immunostaining, western blotting, RT-qPCR, and shRNA interference. Neurobehavioral tests were performed to evaluate therapeutic efficacy. The results demonstrated that IgG leakage, gap formation of tight junction proteins, and matrix metallopeptidase 2 expression were reduced after optogenetic activation of astrocytes (<i>p</i><0.05). Moreover, photo-stimulation of astrocytes protected neurons against apoptosis and improved neurobehavioral outcomes in stroke rats compared to controls (<i>p</i><0.05). Notably, interleukin-10 expression in optogenetic-activated astrocytes significantly increased after ischemic stroke in rats. Inhibition of interleukin-10 in astrocytes compromised the protective effects of optogenetic-activated astrocytes (<i>p</i><0.05). We found for the first time that interleukin-10 derived from optogenetic-activated astrocytes protected blood-brain barrier integrity by decreasing the activity of matrix metallopeptidase 2 and attenuated neuronal apoptosis, which provided a novel therapeutic approach and target in the acute stage of ischemic stroke.",

    "abstract": "Energy storing tendons such as the human Achilles and equine superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) are prone to injury, with incidence increasing with aging, peaking in the 5<sup>th</sup> decade of life in the human Achilles tendon. The interfascicular matrix (IFM), which binds tendon fascicles, plays a key role in energy storing tendon mechanics, and aging alterations to the IFM negatively impact tendon function. While the mechanical role of the IFM in tendon function is well-established, the biological role of IFM-resident cell populations remains to be elucidated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify IFM-resident cell populations and establish how these populations are affected by aging. Cells from young and old SDFTs were subjected to single cell RNA-sequencing, and immunolabelling for markers of each resulting population used to localise cell clusters. Eleven cell clusters were identified, including tenocytes, endothelial cells, mural cells, and immune cells. One tenocyte cluster localised to the fascicular matrix, whereas nine clusters localised to the IFM. Interfascicular tenocytes and mural cells were preferentially affected by aging, with differential expression of genes related to senescence, dysregulated proteostasis and inflammation. This is the first study to establish heterogeneity in IFM cell populations, and to identify age-related alterations specific to IFM-localised cells.",

    "abstract": "Reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the temporoparietal region and gray matter volumes (GMVs) in the temporal lobe were previously reported in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the temporal relationship between reductions in CBF and GMVs requires further investigation. This study sought to determine if reduced CBF is associated with reduced GMVs, or vice versa. Data came from 148 volunteers of the Cardiovascular Health Study Cognition Study (CHS-CS), including 58 normal controls (NC), 50 MCI, and 40 AD who had perfusion and structural MRIs during 2002-2003 (Time 2). Sixty-three of the 148 volunteers had follow-up perfusion and structural MRIs (Time 3). Forty out of the 63 volunteers received prior structural MRIs during 1997-1999 (Time 1). The relationships between GMVs and subsequent CBF changes, and between CBF and subsequent GMV changes were investigated. At Time 2, we observed smaller GMVs (p<0.05) in the temporal pole region in AD compared to NC and MCI. We also found associations between: (1) temporal pole GMVs at Time 2 and subsequent declines in CBF in this region (p=0.0014) and in the temporoparietal region (p=0.0032); (2) hippocampal GMVs at Time 2 and subsequent declines in CBF in the temporoparietal region (p=0.012); and (3) temporal pole CBF at Time 2 and subsequent changes in GMV in this region (p = 0.011). Therefore, hypoperfusion in the temporal pole may be an early event driving its atrophy. Perfusion declines in the temporoparietal and temporal pole follow atrophy in this temporal pole region.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of harmful substances has long been recognized as a likely cause of many neurodegenerative diseases. The two classic brain clearance pathways are cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and vascular circulation systems. Since the discovery of the glymphatic system, research on the CSF pathway has gained momentum, and impaired CSF clearance has been implicated in virtually all neurodegenerative animal models. However, the contribution of the direct participation of vascular transport across the blood-brain barrier in clearing substances is often ignored in glymphatic papers. Supportive evidence for the direct involvement of parenchymal vasculature in substance clearance is accumulated. First, multiple mechanisms have been proposed for the vascular drainage of exogenous and endogenous substances across the blood-brain barriers. Second, the \"traditional\" role of arachnoid villi and granulations as the main site for CSF draining into the vasculature system has been questioned. Third, MRI studies using different CSF tracers indicate that parenchymal vasculature directly participates in tracer efflux, consistent with immunohistochemical findings. Here we will review evidence in the literature that supports the direct participation of the parenchymal vascular system in substance clearance, in addition to the CSF clearance pathways.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia, a group of skeletal muscle diseases with high prevalence in older adults, usually manifests as loss of muscle mass and strength, and/or physical performance decline. Cognitive impairment, defined as impaired function in one or more cognitive domains such as memory, language, computation, comprehension, executive, and visuospatial skills, affects the quality of life and social functioning of patients. Both sarcopenia and cognitive impairment are common geriatric syndromes, and the two disorders interact and influence each other. Declining muscle function accelerates cognitive impairment, and cognitive impairment in turn affects muscle strength. Potential common pathological mechanisms between the two include chronic inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, and gut microbiota disorder. Additionally, neuroendocrine connections including testosterone, insulin, and growth factors have important effects on muscle and brain function. Recently, the development of applied metabolomics technologies has shown significant potential in uncovering shared biochemical pathways and exploring potential biomarkers. Exercise, nutritional, and cognitive interventions are significant as nonpharmacologic approaches in the treatment of sarcopenia and cognitive impairment. However, the specific mechanism of interaction between two diseases, biomarkers and effective therapeutic medications still has knowledge gaps that need to be further explored.",

    "abstract": "In ischemic stroke, neutrophils are the first-line peripheral immune cells infiltrating the brain tissue to form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). The present study aimed to investigate the role of neuronal cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP) in promoting NETs-induced brain endothelial barrier destruction and cerebral edema after ischemic stroke. We found that the expression of NETs and neuronal CIRP in the penumbra increased at 6 hours after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) and increased significantly at 24 hours, reaching a peak at 3 days. NETs degradation or CIRP inhibition can alleviate the leakage of brain endothelial barrier and reverse the decreased expression of tight junction proteins (zonula occludens-1, claudin-5 and occludin) in tMCAO mice. Oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion treated primary neurons or recombinant CIRP could induce NETs formation via TLR4/p38 signaling pathway in vitro. Transcription factor specificity protein 1 (sp1) was responsible for the increased neuronal CIRP expression and the inhibition of sp1 could suppress the increased CIRP expression, reduce NETs formation, and diminish brain endothelial barrier leakage in tMCAO mice. We also found the upregulated CIRP level was associated with severe cerebral edema in patients with acute ischemic stroke. In conclusion, the increased expression of transcription factor sp1 after ischemic stroke can lead to elevated CIRP expression and release from the neurons, which subsequently interacts with neutrophils and promotes NETs formation, resulting in brain endothelial barrier destruction and cerebral edema.",

The immune system monitors the number of senescent cells in the body, while immunosenescence may represent the initiation of systemic aging. Immune cells, particularly T cells, are the most impacted and involved in age-related immune function deterioration, making older individuals more prone to different age-related diseases. T-cell senescence can impact the effectiveness of immunotherapies that rely on the immune system's function, including vaccines and adoptive T-cell therapies. The research and practice of using senescent T cells as therapeutic targets to intervene in age-related diseases are in their nascent stages. Therefore, in this review, we summarize recent related literature to investigate the characteristics of senescent T cells as well as their formation mechanisms, relationship with various aging-related diseases, and means of intervention. The primary objective of this article is to explore the prospects and possibilities of therapeutically targeting senescent T cells, serving as a valuable resource for the development of immunotherapy and treatment of age-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscles and bones are closely connected anatomically and functionally. Age-related degeneration in these tissues is associated with physical disability in the elderly and significantly impacts their quality of life. Understanding the mechanisms of age-related musculoskeletal tissue degeneration is crucial for identifying molecular targets for therapeutic interventions for skeletal muscle atrophy and osteoporosis. The Hippo pathway is a recently identified signaling pathway that plays critical roles in development, tissue homeostasis, and regeneration. The Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) are key downstream effectors of the mammalian Hippo signaling pathway. This review highlights the fundamental roles of YAP and TAZ in the homeostatic maintenance and regeneration of skeletal muscles and bones. YAP/TAZ play a significant role in stem cell function by relaying various environmental signals to stem cells. Skeletal muscle atrophy and osteoporosis are related to stem cell dysfunction or senescence triggered by YAP/TAZ dysregulation resulting from reduced mechanosensing and mitochondrial function in stem cells. In contrast, the maintenance of YAP/TAZ activation can suppress stem cell senescence and tissue dysfunction and may be used as a basis for the development of potential therapeutic strategies. Thus, targeting YAP/TAZ holds significant therapeutic potential for alleviating age-related muscle and bone dysfunction and improving the quality of life in the elderly.",

These ulcers are associated with substantial morbidity, recurrence rates, disability, and mortality, imposing substantial economic, psychological, and medical burdens. Timely detection and intervention can mitigate the morbidity and disparities linked to DFU. Nevertheless, current therapeutic approaches for DFU continue to grapple with multifaceted limitations.

Interventions that try to delay cellular senescence, eliminate senescent cells (SnCs), or suppress the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) have shown promise for helping chronic wounds to heal. In this context, targeting cellular senescence emerges as a novel therapeutic strategy for DFU. In this comprehensive review, we look at the pathology and treatment of DFU in a systematic way. We also explain the growing importance of investigating SnCs in DFU and highlight the great potential of senotherapeutics that target SnCs in DFU treatment. The development of efficacious and safe senotherapeutics represents a pioneering therapeutic approach aimed at enhancing the quality of life for individuals affected by DFU.",

Yes-associated protein (YAP) functions as a critical mediator of fibrogenesis; however, its therapeutic potential in chronic biliary diseases such as PSC remains unestablished. The objective of this study is to elucidate the possible significance of YAP inhibition in biliary fibrosis by examining the pathophysiology of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and biliary epithelial cells (BEC). Human liver tissue samples from PSC patients were analyzed to assess the expression of YAP/connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) relative to non-fibrotic control samples. The pathophysiological relevance of YAP/CTGF in HSC and BEC was investigated in primary human HSC (phHSC), LX-2, H69, and TFK-1 cell lines through siRNA or pharmacological inhibition utilizing verteporfin (VP) and metformin (MF). The Abcb4<sup>-/-</sup> mouse model was employed to evaluate the protective effects of pharmacological YAP inhibition. Hanging droplet and 3D matrigel culture techniques were utilized to investigate YAP expression and activation status of phHSC under various physical conditions. YAP/CTGF upregulation was observed in PSC patients. Silencing YAP/CTGF led to inhibition of phHSC activation and reduced contractility of LX-2 cells, as well as suppression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in H69 cells and proliferation of TFK-1 cells. Pharmacological inhibition of YAP mitigated chronic liver fibrosis <i>in vivo</i> and diminished ductular reaction and EMT. YAP expression in phHSC was effectively modulated by altering extracellular stiffness, highlighting YAP's role as a mechanotransducer. In conclusion, YAP regulates the activation of HSC and EMT in BEC, thereby functioning as a checkpoint of fibrogenesis in chronic cholestasis. Both VP and MF demonstrate effectiveness as YAP inhibitors, capable of inhibiting biliary fibrosis. These findings suggest that VP and MF warrant further investigation as potential therapeutic options for the treatment of PSC.",

A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from September 1, 2019, to December 31, 2022, encompassing reported NIID cases confirmed by pathogenic NOTCH2NLC mutations. Linear regressions and trend analyses were performed. Analyzing 635 cases from 85 included studies revealed that familial cases exhibited significantly larger GGC repeat expansions than sporadic cases (p < 0.001), and this frequency significantly increased with expanding GGC repeats (p trend < 0.001). Age at onset (AAO) showed a negative correlation with GGC repeat expansions (p < 0.001). The predominant initial symptoms included tremor (31.70%), cognitive impairment (14.12%), and muscle weakness (10.66%). The decreased or absent tendon reflex (DTR/ATR) emerged as a notable clinical indicator of NIID due to its high prevalence. U-fiber was observed in 79.11% of patients, particularly prominent in paroxysmal disease-dominant (87.50%) and dementia-dominant cases (81.08%). Peripheral neuropathy-dominant cases exhibited larger GGC repeat expansions (median = 123.00) and an earlier AAO (median = 33.00) than other phenotypes. Moreover, a significant genetic anticipation of 3.5 years was observed (p = 0.039). This study provides a comprehensive and up-to-date compilation of genotypic and phenotypic information on NIID since the identification of the causative gene NOTCH2NLC.

Based on recent laboratory evidence that young blood can rejuvenate the brain, muscle, and heart, we were intrigued by the possible protective effect of young plasma on acute kidney injury in aged mice. Here, we demonstrated that young plasma from 2-month-old mice could attenuate chronic kidney disease progression in 15-month-old mice subjected to acute kidney injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion. In the aged mice after acute kidney injury, young plasma administration decreased tubulointerstitial injury, fibrosis, and tertiary lymphoid tissue formation in kidneys assessed on day 28 after acute injury despite no significant beneficial effect on injury severity and survival. Mechanistically, young plasma inhibited angiotensin II-activated chemokines in pericytes that were responsible for tertiary lymphoid tissue formation. In summary, our data provide evidence that young plasma attenuates the transition from acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease in aged mice. The therapeutic potential of young plasma infusion or exchange in the aged patients suffering acute kidney injury needs to be addressed in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Osteoporotic fractures are the most severe complications of osteoporosis, characterized by poor bone quality, difficult realignment and fixation, slow fracture healing, and a high risk of recurrence. Clinically managing these fractures is relatively challenging, and in the context of rapid aging, they pose significant social hazards. The rapid advancement of disciplines such as biophysics and biochemistry brings new opportunities for future medical diagnosis and treatment. However, there has been limited attention to precision diagnosis and treatment strategies for osteoporotic fractures both domestically and internationally. In response to this, the Chinese Medical Association Orthopaedic Branch Youth Osteoporosis Group, Chinese Geriatrics Society Geriatric Orthopaedics Committee, Chinese Medical Doctor Association Orthopaedic Physicians Branch Youth Committee Osteoporosis Group, and Shanghai Association of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Osteoporosis Professional Committee have collaborated to develop this consensus. It aims to elucidate emerging technologies that may play a pivotal role in both diagnosis and treatment, advocating for clinicians to embrace interdisciplinary approaches and incorporate these new technologies into their practice. Ultimately, the goal is to improve the prognosis and quality of life for elderly patients with osteoporotic fractures.",

    "abstract": "End-stage liver disease (ESLD), stemming from a spectrum of chronic liver pathologies including chronic liver failure, acute cirrhosis decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma, imposes a significant global healthcare burden. Liver transplantation (LT) remains the only treatment for ESLD. However, the escalating mortality on transplant waitlists has prompted the utilization of marginal liver grafts in LT procedures. These grafts primarily encompass elderly livers, steatotic livers, livers from donation after circulatory death, split livers and those infected with the hepatitis virus. While the expansion of the donor pool offers promise, it also introduces concomitant risks. These encompass graft failure, biliary and cardiovascular complications, the recurrence of liver disease and reduced patient and graft survival. Consequently, various established strategies, ranging from improved donor-recipient matching to surgical interventions, have emerged to mitigate these risks. This article undertakes a comprehensive assessment of the current landscape, evaluating the viability of diverse marginal liver grafts. Additionally, it synthesizes approaches aimed at enhancing the quality of such marginal liver grafts. The overarching objective is to augment the donor pool and ameliorate the risk factors associated with the shortage of liver grafts.",

Skeletal muscle aging is accompanied by underlying metabolic changes. Therefore, elucidating these metabolic profiles and specific mechanisms holds promise for informing prevention and treatment strategies for sarcopenia. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the key metabolites identified in current clinical studies on sarcopenia and their potential pathophysiological alterations in metabolic activity.

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a widespread health condition both in the United States and around the world, with insulin resistance playing a critical role in its development. Effective treatment strategies are essential for managing T2D and mitigating associated risks. Adiponectin (APN), secreted by adipocytes, exhibits an inverse correlation with obesity-related adiposity, and its levels are negatively associated with insulin resistance and body mass index. This study aimed to enhance endogenous APN levels in a diet-induced obese (DIO) mouse model using lipid nanoparticles (LNP) as safe delivery agents for APN mRNA conjugates. The results indicate that APN-mRNA-LNP administration successfully induced APN synthesis in various tissues, including muscle, liver, kidney, pancreas, and adipose cells. This induction was associated with several positive outcomes, such as preventing diet-induced body weight gain, improving hyperglycemia by promoting Glut-4 expression, alleviating diabetic nephropathy symptoms by blocking the EGFR pathway, and reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine production. In addition, the treatment demonstrated enhanced insulin sensitivity by activating DGKd and inhibiting PKCε. This resulted in reactivation of insulin receptors in insulin target tissues and stimulation of insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. The findings of the present study highlight the potential of APN-mRNA-LNP-based nucleic acid therapy as a treatment for type 2 diabetes, offering a comprehensive approach to addressing its complexities.",

Extensive research indicates that depression is very complex, with many interconnected pathways involved. Most research related to depression focuses on monoamines, neurotrophic factors, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, tryptophan metabolism, energy metabolism, mitochondrial function, the gut-brain axis, glial cell-mediated inflammation, myelination, homeostasis, and brain neural networks. However, recently, Ketamine, an ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has been discovered to have rapid antidepressant effects in patients, leading to novel and successful treatment approaches for mood disorders. This review aims to summarize the latest findings and insights into various signaling pathways and systems observed in depression patients and animal models, providing a more comprehensive view of the neurobiology of anxious-depressive-like behavior. Specifically, it highlights the key mechanisms of ketamine as a rapid-acting antidepressant, aiming to enhance the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Moreover, we discuss the potential of ketamine as a prophylactic or therapeutic intervention for stress-related psychiatric disorders.",

In this article, we focus on red blood cells (RBCs) and provide a review of the known changes associated with the characterization of RBC deformability in aging and related pathologies. The biophysical parameters complement the commonly used biochemical parameters and may contribute to a better understanding of the aging process. The power of the deformability measurement approach is well established in clinical settings. Measuring RBCs' deformability has the advantage of relative simplicity, and it reflects the complex effects developing in erythrocytes during aging. However, aging and related pathological conditions also promote heterogeneity of RBC features and have a certain impact on the variance in erythrocyte cell properties. The possible applications of deformability as an early biophysical biomarker of pathological states are discussed, and modulating PIEZO1 as a therapeutic target is suggested. The changes in RBCs' shape can serve as a proxy for deformability evaluation, leveraging single-cell analysis with imaging flow cytometry and artificial intelligence algorithms. The characterization of biophysical parameters of RBCs is in progress in humans and will provide a better understanding of the complex dynamics of aging.",

Consequently, understanding the underlying causes of aging and exploring potential anti-aging interventions is imperative. In females, the ovaries serve as the principal organs responsible for ovulation and the production of female hormones. The aging ovaries are related to infertility, menopause, and associated menopausal syndromes, with menopause representing the culmination of ovarian aging. Current evidence indicates that ovarian aging may contribute to dysfunction across multiple organ systems, including, but not limited to, cognitive impairment, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular disease. Nevertheless, due to the widespread distribution of sex hormone receptors throughout the body, ovarian aging affects not only these specific organs but also influences a broader spectrum of age-related diseases in women. Despite this, the impact of ovarian aging on overall age-related diseases has been largely neglected. This review provides a thorough summary of the impact of ovarian aging on age-related diseases, encompassing the nervous, circulatory, locomotor, urinary, digestive, respiratory, and endocrine systems. Additionally, we have outlined prospective therapeutic approaches for addressing both ovarian aging and age-related diseases, with the aim of mitigating their impacts and preserving women's fertility, physical health, and psychological well-being.",

    "abstract": "Aging is marked by a progressive decrease in physiological function and reserve capacity, which results in increased susceptibility to diseases. Understanding the mechanisms of driving aging is crucial for extending health span and promoting human longevity. Hypoxia, marked by reduced oxygen availability, has emerged as a promising area of study within aging research. This review explores recent findings on the potential of oxygen restriction to promote healthy aging and extend lifespan. While the role of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) in cellular responses to hypoxia is well-established, its impact on lifespan remains complex and context-dependent. Investigations in invertebrate models suggest a role for HIF-1 in longevity, while evidence in mammalian models is limited. Hypoxia extends the lifespan independent of dietary restriction (DR), a known intervention underlying longevity. However, both hypoxia and DR converge on common downstream effectors, such as forkhead box O (FOXO) and flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMOs) to modulate the lifespan. Further work is required to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying hypoxia-induced longevity and optimize clinical applications. Understanding the crosstalk between HIF-1 and other longevity-associated pathways is crucial for developing interventions to enhance lifespan and healthspan. Future studies may uncover novel therapeutic strategies to promote healthy aging and longevity in human populations.",

    "abstract": "As the resident macrophages of the brain, microglia are crucial immune cells specific to the central nervous system (CNS). They constantly surveil their surroundings and trigger immunological reactions, playing a key role in various neurodegenerative diseases (ND). As illnesses progress, microglia exhibit multiple phenotypes. Traditionally, microglia have been classified into two main phenotypes upon activation: the pro-inflammatory M1 polarization and the anti-inflammatory M2 polarization. However, this classification is now considered overly simplistic, as it is unable to fully convey the intricacy and diversity of the inflammatory response. Immune regulatory factors, such as chemokines secreted by microglia, are essential for modulating brain development, maintaining the neural milieu, and orchestrating responses to injury, along with the subsequent repair processes. However, in recent years, the significance of metabolic reprogramming in both physiological microglial activity and ND has also become increasingly recognized. Upon activation-triggered by brain injury, infection, or ND-microglia typically modify their metabolic processes by transitioning from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) phosphorylation to glycolysis. This shift facilitates rapid energy production but may also enhance pro-inflammatory responses. This review seeks to summarize metabolic reprogramming and polarization in the function of microglia and their involvement in ND.",

    "abstract": "It is generally assumed that dementia affects the quality of optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans. However, the magnitude of this effect and its independence from other factors require further clarification. In this cross-sectional study, our aim was to evaluate the association between cognitive impairment and OCT scan quality, adjusting for key confounders, in a multiethnic cohort. 541 participants aged 50 years or older were recruited from memory clinics and the community at the National University Hospital and St. Luke's Hospital, Singapore. They were then stratified into three groups: no cognitive impairment (NCI, n=112), cognitive impairment without dementia (CIND, n=235), and dementia (n=194); OCT scan quality was subsequently assessed based on the presence and severity of artifacts. We found that dementia patients were nearly three times more likely to produce poor-quality OCT scans compared to NCI participants (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=2.90; 95% CI, 1.24-6.80). Lower cognitive scores, including Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (OR=0.92; 95% CI, 0.88-0.96), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (OR=0.90; 95% CI, 0.86-0.94), and higher Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores (OR=2.11; 95% CI, 1.43-3.10), were also independently associated with poor scan quality. In conclusion, cognitive impairment, particularly dementia, substantially increases the likelihood of poor-quality OCT scans, even after accounting for key demographic and clinical factors. Hence, strategies tailored to improve imaging in this population are essential for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and patient care.",

    "abstract": "Solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11), or xCT, is a cystine-glutamate antiporter crucial for maintaining cellular antioxidant capacity through the uptake of cystine, which is vital for glutathione synthesis. This protein plays an important role in regulating ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death. Fibrosis, a pathological condition characterized by the excessive accumulation of fibrous connective tissue, is a health challenge because it can lead to organ dysfunction and failure. Emerging evidence links SLC7A11 to the regulation of fibrosis through its involvement in ferroptosis and other mechanisms. This review aims to explore the effects of SLC7A11 on fibrotic diseases in various organs. We will delve into both ferroptosis-dependent and -independent pathways and propose therapeutic strategies that target SLC7A11 to mitigate fibrosis, emphasizing the need for cell-type-specific interventions. This review provides a foundational understanding for the development of targeted treatments involving SLC7A11 for managing fibrotic diseases.",

Nevertheless, NK cell senescence, characterized by phenotypic and functional changes, substantially compromises their antitumor immune response. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the molecular mechanisms governing NK cell senescence and its implications for cancer immunotherapy. We propose a refined definition of NK cell senescence based on distinct biomarkers, including elevated CD57 expression, reduced cytotoxicity, and altered cytokine secretion. Moreover, we investigate the complex interactions between the tumor microenvironment (TME) and NK cell senescence, highlighting the influence of chronic inflammation, immunosuppressive cytokines, and persistent tumor antigenic stimulation. Additionally, this review underscores the potential utility of senescent NK cells as biomarkers for assessing antitumor efficacy and examines the adverse effects of NK cell senescence on cancer immunotherapy. Lastly, we summarize current approaches to mitigate NK cell senescence, such as gene editing techniques and cytokine modulation, which may enhance the efficacy of NK cell-based immunotherapies. By establishing a comprehensive framework for understanding NK cell senescence within the TME, this review aims to guide future research and the development of innovative therapeutic strategies targeting senescent NK cells to improve cancer immunotherapy outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of aging that imposes a heavy medical and socioeconomic burden. Its multifactorial pathology-including amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation, tauopathy, and chronic neuroinflammation-lacks effective disease-modifying treatments. Recent studies highlight the gut-brain axis, specifically the intestinal mycobiome (fungal community), as a novel factor in AD. In this review, we summarize evidence on gut fungi in AD. Altered gut fungal profiles have been reported in AD patients, including enrichment of Candida tropicalis and Schizophyllum commune and reduction of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, and in AD mouse models, such as increased abundance of the Dipodascaceae family. Fungi can translocate or release bioactive molecules that impact the brain; for instance, fungal proteins (enolase, β-tubulin) and polysaccharides (chitin) have been detected in AD brain tissue. Fungal metabolites also emerge as potential biomarkers; notably, plasma sterigmatocystin levels were significantly higher in AD patients compared to controls. Mechanistically, gut fungi (such as Candida or Malassezia species) may activate microglia and promote Aβ deposition via inflammatory pathways, while fungal prion-like proteins can accelerate AD protein aggregation in vitro. Conversely, certain fungi exert neuroprotective effects; oral administration of the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii attenuated cognitive deficits and Aβ pathology in APP/PS1 mice. Importantly, fecal fungal profiling is non-invasive and may serve as a practical AD screening tool. Collectively, these findings nominate gut fungi as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Future work should validate specific mycobiome signatures and develop fungus-targeted interventions to enable earlier diagnosis and novel treatments for AD.",

While PD is typically considered a disorder primarily affecting the central nervous system, there is mounting evidence of cellular dysfunction and PD pathology occurring in the peripheral nervous system, likely preceding central manifestations. In this context, it has become increasingly evident that dysregulation of both the central and the peripheral immune system plays a key role in PD pathogenesis and progression. In this narrative review, we describe and discuss the methodological approaches employed in human studies to investigate immune responses in PD pathogenesis and progression, their main findings and the potential to unveil novel therapeutic avenues. In particular, we present methodologies employed in and insights gained from human genetic studies, techniques utilized to investigate neuroinflammatory processes in post-mortem and living human brains, to investigate the blood-brain barrier, as well as the involvement of peripheral T cells and innate immune cells. Additionally, we elucidate methodologies utilized to explore the roles of mitochondrial dysfunction and infectious diseases in PD. Finally, we address the causes behind conflicting findings in the published literature, which may stem from disparities in sample ascertainment schemes, immunological protocols, and analysis designs. Given these challenges, it becomes imperative to develop methodological guidelines to enhance the validity of immunological studies in PD and facilitate their translation into clinical medicine.",

Pericytes have been shown to mediate the \"no-reflow\" phenomenon by constricting capillaries in experimental stroke models, implicating their critical role in early microcirculation dysfunction. However, little is known about the long-term fate of pericytes and their contribution to sustained microcirculation dysfunction in prolonged period of time. We conducted repeated longitudinal observations of pericyte fate and function, as well as blood flow dynamics across multiple vascular segments, using two-photon imaging in PDGFRβ-tdTomato mice subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) over a 14-day period. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify imaging features independently associated with capillary perfusion on day 14. Types of pericyte death were assessed using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Fasudil and the RIPK1 inhibitor necrostatin-1 were administered to modulate pericyte dysfunction and survival during the acute and subacute phases of stroke. Outcomes were evaluated by total capillary perfusion, infarct volume, blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and neurological function over 14 days. Pericyte loss observed on day 7 post-stroke was independently associated with impaired microcirculation perfusion, as indicated by a reduction in total capillary volume. While fasudil treatment alone improved microcirculation perfusion on day 3, it did not alter pericyte fate or improve outcomes by day 14. Necroptosis was found to contribute to delayed pericyte loss in the ischemic penumbra. Combined therapy with fasudil and necrostatin-1 effectively prevented delayed pericytes loss and improved both microcirculation perfusion and neurological outcomes on day 14. Delayed pericyte loss contributes to irreversible microcirculation dysfunction in the subacute phase of stroke. Targeting pericyte dysfunction and necroptosis following recanalization represents a promising therapeutic strategy for enhance stroke recovery.",

    "abstract": "Although aging is increasingly recognized as a key factor in chronic disease management, preclinical drug development rarely incorporates direct assessments of lifespan. To date, no biotechnology company has conducted a full mouse lifespan study for a therapeutic agent prior to human clinical trials, despite widespread chronic use of many approved drugs. This oversight stems from a lack of standardized protocols for the incorporation of mouse lifespan studies, high costs, limited commercial incentives, and regulatory risks associated with long-term data. Here, we present a comprehensive and scalable protocol for conducting mouse longevity studies in the early stages of drug development. Being aware of monetary constraints in the drug discovery process, we propose a basic design for a longevity study on ~250 (176 males and 72 females) genetically heterogeneous mice (UM-HET3) per group, with survival curves as primary endpoint, and propose enhanced study design options only if budget allows. Our framework provides a standardized foundation for integrating longevity assessments into routine drug development, offering the potential to uncover long-term risks or benefits that traditional toxicology studies may overlook. Broad implementation of such protocols could support the development of safer and more effective therapeutics for chronic diseases, while opening new avenues for discovery of substances that could slow down the rate of aging, known as geroprotectors.",

    "abstract": "With rising life expectancy, more elderly individuals are undergoing surgery, highlighting the need to understand postoperative neurological complications. Studies have linked general anesthesia (GA) to olfactory dysfunction (OD) and cognitive decline following operation (OP), though mechanisms remain unclear. Using aged C57BL/6 mice subjected to laparotomy and 2-hour isoflurane exposure, we assessed behavioral and molecular outcomes through functional tests and bulk RNA sequencing (RNAseq). We observed persistent OD in the weeks following GA/OP, along with reduced limb strength and motor coordination, indicative of increased frailty. While no immediate cognitive deficits were apparent, aged mice exhibited delayed cognitive impairments, including diminished learning and memory in Y-maze and novel object recognition tasks, as well as increased apathy in nest-building behavior. RNAseq of the olfactory bulb (OB) at 1-day post-GA/OP revealed upregulation of ubiquitin-dependent proteins and catabolic processes in the aged mice compared to sham group. In contrast, transcriptomic analysis of the hippocampus (HI) at 5 weeks after GA/OP showed more extensive molecular pathway changes, correlating with the delayed impairment of cognitive functions. Compared to young adult mice, aged GA/OP mice demonstrated upregulated expression of genes associated with innate immunity and reduced neurogenesis in the OB, along with increased gliogenesis and reduced RNA splicing activity in the HI. Additionally, in vivo electrophysiology recordings from the OB mitral cell layer revealed alterations in neuronal excitability and circuit disruptions after GA/OP. Taken together, our findings provided functional, molecular, and circuit-level insights into the age-dependent persistent olfactory impairment and delayed cognitive dysfunctions following general anesthesia and surgery.",

    "abstract": "Osteosarcopenia the concurrent deterioration of bone (osteoporosis) and muscle (sarcopenia) represents a critical yet understudied geriatric syndrome that synergistically amplifies frailty, fractures, and loss of independence in aging populations. This dual pathology imposes a staggering socioeconomic burden through increased disability, prolonged hospitalization, and elevated mortality. Despite its clinical urgency, therapeutic advances remain stagnant, as current interventions e.g., bisphosphonates, vitamin D supplementation are palliative and fail to address the shared molecular drivers of bone-muscle crosstalk. Emerging evidence implicates cellular senescence and epigenetic dysregulation as convergent mechanisms driving osteosarcopenia. Senescent osteocytes, burdened by oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines e.g., IL-6, TNF-α and matrix-degrading enzymes (e.g., MMPs) via the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which erodes bone integrity and propagates muscle atrophy. Simultaneously, epigenetic alterations DNA hypermethylation of osteogenic genes RUNX2, histone deacetylation repressing myogenesis MYOD1, and dysregulated non-coding RNAs (miR-133, miR-214) lock musculoskeletal tissues into a degenerative state. These processes are exacerbated by age-related inflammaging and metabolic disturbances e.g., NAD+ depletion, which amplify oxidative stress and chromatin instability. The synergy between senescence and epigenetics in perpetuating osteosarcopenia remains poorly defined. Most preclinical models overlook comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, chronic inflammation) that accelerate musculoskeletal decline. Current therapies senolytics, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors lack tissue specificity and exhibit pleiotropic effects. This review addresses these gaps by synthesizing cutting-edge insights into the senescence-epigenetics axis as a unifying driver of osteosarcopenia. By elucidating how SASP factors (e.g., myostatin) and epigenetic reprogramming e.g., sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) hypermethylation disrupt bone-muscle crosstalk, we propose novel strategies to break the self-sustaining cycle of tissue degeneration. We highlight the promise of precision geroscience leveraging CRISPR-engineered organoids, multi-omics profiling, and AI-driven biomarkers to decode tissue-specific vulnerabilities and design dual-target therapies e.g., senolytics ++ bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, synaptic dysfunction, and chronic neuroinflammation. Mounting evidence suggests that inflammasome activation plays a pivotal role in the onset and progression of AD by promoting neuronal damage, Tau pathology, and amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation. Among the various inflammasome types expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), NLRP3 has received particular attention due to its strong association with both AD and pain-related neuroinflammation. Chronic pain, frequently observed in older adults and individuals with dementia, shares overlapping inflammatory mechanisms with AD, including glial activation and cytokine dysregulation. The inflammasome-microRNA (miR) axis has recently emerged as a key regulatory pathway modulating these neuroinflammatory responses. Specific inflammation-associated miRs, such as miR-22, miR-34a, miR-146a, miR-155, and miR-223, influence innate immune signaling and critically affect both neuronal homeostasis and pain sensitization. Emerging evidence also implicates dysfunction of the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic (LC-NE) system-an early target of AD pathology-in amplifying neuroinflammation and pain sensitivity, partly through interactions with dysregulated miRs. While previous studies have addressed the roles of inflamma-miRs in AD or chronic pain individually, this review uniquely examines their interconnected roles-highlighting how dysregulated miR expression and inflammasome activation may converge to drive persistent neuroinflammation across both conditions. By elucidating shared molecular pathways, we propose that targeting the inflammasome-miR axis may offer dual therapeutic potential: slowing AD progression while addressing pain-related neural dysfunction. As the prevalence of AD rises, such integrated insights are essential for the development of more precise, mechanism-based interventions.",

We analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data from the striatum of hemorrhagic, ischemic, and control mice, revealing activation of mitochondrial autophagy and assembly processes after stroke. Gene Ontology functional enrichment analysis indicated that stroke-associated genes predominantly regulate mitochondrial maintenance, with leucyl-tRNA synthetase 2 (Lars2) markedly upregulated in post-stroke microglia. A distinct microglial subset (Mc) was identified with notably low Lars2 expression. In vitro, Lars2 overexpression enhanced mitochondrial function, reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and suppressed Mc marker gene expression. Cell-cell communication analysis revealed Mc as the most interactive microglial subset following stroke, particularly engaging with neurons. Among neuron-Mc signaling pairs, the neurotrophic factor pleiotrophin-syndecan-4 (PTN-SDC4) ligand-receptor pair emerged as a key mediator. Conditioned media from stressed microglia upregulated neuronal Ptn expression, likely recruiting microglia, as exogenous PTN promoted microglial migration. These findings identify Mc as a stroke-induced microglial population with low Lars2 expression and pro-inflammatory features. The lack of compensatory mitochondrial repair in Mc contributes to pro-inflammatory polarization, positioning Lars2 as a mitochondrial checkpoint linking stroke-induced microglial reprogramming to neuroinflammation.",

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence is involved in early development, wound healing, and tumor suppression. However, the accumulation of senescent cells (SCs) drives tissue dysfunction and many age associated pathologies such as cancer and neurodegeneration. SCs demonstrate irreversible cessation of cell cycle, overexpression of anti-apodotic proteins, and senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP), cause tissue dysfunction. Traditional senolytics induces apoptosis but have poor selectivity, uncertain long-term efficacy, and resistant SCs, limiting their use. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent, non-apoptotic form of programmed cell death, has emerged as a promising alternative. SCs bypass the apoptosis by overexpression of an anti-apoptotic pathway, but ferroptosis uses oxidative damage to overcome these defenses, thus, making it effective for eliminating SCs. This review critically evaluates ferroptosis-mediated processes such as elevated level of iron, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and oxidative damages in elimination of SCs and its therapeutic potential for age related pathologies including fibrosis, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. This review highlights the molecular mechanisms underlying ferroptosis and its potential for treating age-related diseases such as fibrosis, atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis, and neurodegeneration. By addressing the translational challenges of ferroptosis-based therapies, we emphasize its potential as a next generation senolytic for targeting senescence and aging-related pathologies.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment. Metabolic disturbances, particularly brain insulin resistance, are increasingly recognized as central features of AD pathophysiology. Astrocytes, essential for brain energy metabolism, exhibit a loss of homeostatic functions in AD, possibly promoting neurodegeneration. Even though the main astrocytic glucose transporters are non-insulin dependent, insulin may regulate astroglial glucose metabolism. Our objective was to evaluate insulin signaling and astrocyte metabolism in the PDAPP-J20 transgenic mouse model of familial AD and in mouse primary astrocyte cultures exposed to Aβ. Adult PDAPP-J20 mice showed hyperinsulinemia, hippocampal insulin resistance and astrocytic proinflammatory activation. The reactive glial phenotype was accompanied by decreased insulin receptor levels in this chronic setting. Exposure of primary astrocytes to Aβ induced proinflammatory activation, oxidative stress and loss of glutamate transporter EAAT2, crucial for neuroprotection. Even though Aβ-exposed astrocytes showed increased insulin receptor levels in this acute setting, insulin-induced phosphorylation of the receptor was hampered. Amyloid-treated astrocytes also showed increased glucose uptake, lactate release and glycogen storage. Insulin treatment was associated with a recovery of mitochondrial membrane potential and increased amyloid uptake, highlighting a pro-homeostatic role for the hormone. Our results highlight the interplay between insulin signaling and astrocyte metabolism at different experimental and temporal settings of amyloid pathology. Understanding these mechanisms may help to design therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring metabolic balance and mitigating neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "The HIV-infected older adult (HOA) community is particularly vulnerable to cognitive impairment.Previous studies in the general older adult population have reported that lower scores on tests of cognitive function often correlate negatively with aerobic fitness [5-7].HIV-infected individuals have significantly reduced aerobic fitness and physical function compared to HIV-uninfected individuals.Determining important correlates of cognitive ability may be beneficial in not only detecting precursors to future cognitive impairments, but also target areas for interventions.The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between cognitive ability and aerobic fitness in HIV-infected older adults.We conducted a cross-sectional study of HOA on antiretroviral therapy (ART) >50 years of age.Domain specific cognitive function was assessed by means of a neuropsychological battery.Aerobic fitness (VO2peak) was assessed using a graded, progressive treadmill test.Thirty-seven HOA on ART (mean±SD: age 59±6years, BMI 28±5, CD4 663±337 cells/ml, duration since HIV diagnosis 17±7 years; 81% males) completed the cognitive tests.Several domains of cognition were significantly associated with VO2peak by Spearman correlation analysis (p<0.05).By step-wise adjusted regression VO2peak was most frequently and significantly related to many cognitive domains such as verbal and visual memory, visual perception, and language (p<0.05).We found that participants with higher Vo2peak were less likely to have more severe forms of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) such as mild neurocognitive disorder (OR=0.65;p=0.01) and HIV-associated dementia (OR=0.64;p=0.0006).In HOA and in conclusion, aerobic fitness is related to cognitive performance on various tasks.The likelihood of cognitive impairment increased with lower fitness levels.Therefore, increased fitness may serve an important factor in maintenance of cognition and neural integrity for aging HIV-infected individuals.Future prospective and large scale studies are needed to evaluate the effect of fitness and vascular stiffness and function on cognition and brain structure among HOA.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence demonstrates that age and disease-related decline in cognition depends not only upon degeneration in brain structure and function, but also on dietary intake and nutritional status. Memory, a potential preclinical marker of Alzheimer’s disease, is supported by white matter integrity in the brain and dietary patterns high in omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. However, the extent to which memory is supported by specific omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and the degree to which this relationship is reliant upon microstructure of particular white matter regions is not known. This study therefore examined the cross-sectional relationship between empirically-derived patterns of omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (represented by nutrient biomarker patterns), memory, and regional white matter microstructure in healthy, older adults. We measured thirteen plasma phospholipid omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, memory, and regional white matter microstructure in 94 cognitively intact older adults (65 to 75 years old). A three-step mediation analysis was implemented using multivariate linear regressions, adjusted for age, gender, education, income, depression status, and body mass index. The mediation analysis revealed that a mixture of plasma phospholipid omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids is linked to memory and that white matter microstructure of the fornix fully mediates the relationship between this pattern of plasma phospholipid polyunsaturated fatty acids and memory. These results suggest that memory may be optimally supported by a balance of plasma phospholipid omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids through the preservation of fornix white matter microstructure in cognitively intact older adults. This report provides novel evidence for the benefits of plasma phospholipid omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid balance on memory and underlying white matter microstructure.",

MiRNAs play key roles in tumor metastasis. This study aimed to investigate the specific miRNAs as putative indicators of metastasis early diagnosis for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, five NSCLC cases with LN metastasis and four cases without metastasis (NLN) were enrolled for Agilent Human miRNA array. The interested differentially expressed miRNA was validated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in the LN metastasis (n = 46) and NLN (n = 39) groups. The microarray results revealed that three miRNAs (miR-1260b, miR-423-3p, miR-23a-5p) were differentially expressed in LN metastasis group compared with NLN group. The expression of miR-1260b was tested by qRT-PCR and the mean relative expression fold change (2(-ΔΔCt)) in LN metastasis was significantly higher than that in the NLN group (3.942, 1.743 respectively, P = 1.179E-04). The patients with tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage III were identified more frequently in LN metastasis group (P = 1.772E-11) and with a higher expression level of miR-1260b (5.126, P = 1.147E-06). In addition, the LN metastasis cases were associated with a poorly differentiated degree (P = 0.007). The overexpression of miR-1260b in NSCLC with LN metastasis can be regarded as a specific signature for early progression and prognosis of NSCLC.",

The importance of identifying pre-disposing factors that lead to venous stasis lies in the foundation of understanding the etiology, pathophysiology and clinical presentation. The precise therapeutic role of interventional therapies is not fully understood though the current data do suggest potential applications. The aim of the study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the utility of and short-term 30-day survival after endovascular therapy for patients with DVST. Standard PRISMA guidelines were followed. Data sources included PubMed keywords and phrases, which were also incorporated into a MeSH search to yield articles indexed in Medline over a 5-year period. All RCTs, observational cohort studies, and administrative registries comparing or reporting DVST were included. Sixty-six studies met inclusion criteria. 35 articles investigating treatment in a summation of 10,285 patients were eligible for data extraction and included in the review of treatment modalities. A total of 312 patients were included for statistical analysis. All patients included received endovascular intervention with direct thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy or both. 133 (42.6%) patients were documented to have a neurologic decline, which prompted endovascular intervention. All patients who had endovascular interventions were those who were started on and failed systemic anticoagulation. 44 patients were reported to have intracranial hemorrhages after intervention. Regardless of systemic anticoagulation, patients were still reported to have complications of VTE and PE. Primary outcome at 3-6 month follow up revealed mRS<1 in 224 patients. DVST presents with many diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. The utility of invasive interventions such as local thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy is not fully understood. It is exceedingly difficult to conduct large randomized trials for this low incidence disease process with large pathophysiological heterogeneity.",

The objective of this study is to investigate demographic data, etiologies, laboratory values, prognostic factors, and mortality of rhabdomyolysis in the geriatric population. A 4-years retrospective chart review study was conducted. Our inclusion criteria were age above 65 years and creatinine kinase level excess five times of normal upper limit. Among 167 patients, 47.3% were male. The median age at diagnosis was 80.11 (66-101) years. The duration of follow up in the study ranged from 0 to 48 months. Fall (with or without immobilization) was the most frequent cause of rhabdomyolysis in 56.9%. The mean baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR), GFR at diagnosis, and peak decline in GFR was 76.94, 48.96, and 54.41 cc/min respectively. The mean CK at diagnosis and peak CK was 5097.22 and 6320.07. There were 45 deaths (21%) over the span of 4 years. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that number of medications pre-admission (Meds No.), peak decline in GFR, and acute kidney injury (AKI) are independent predictors for overall survival for rhabdomyolysis in the elderly. To our knowledge, this is the first epidemiological study of rhabdomyolysis in the elderly. Falls (with and without immobilization) were the most common etiology. Meds No. (>8), peak decline in GFR (<30 cc/min), and evidence of AKI are associated with shorter overall survival and can serve as potential independent prognostic markers for rhabdomyolysis in elderly patients.",

    "abstract": "Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) can improve clinical outcome in eligible patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). However, its efficacy is strongly time-dependent. This study was aimed to examine whether prehospital notification by emergency medical service (EMS) providers could reduce onset to needle time (ONT) and improve neurological outcome in AIS patients who received IVT. We prospectively collected the consecutive clinical and time data of AIS patients who received IVT during one year after the initiation of prehospital notification procedure (PNP). Patients were divided into three groups, including patients that transferred by EMS with and without PNP and other means of transportation (non-EMS). We then compared the effect of EMS with PNP and EMS use only on ONT, and the subsequent neurological outcome. Good outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 3-months. In 182 patients included in this study, 77 (42.3%) patients were transferred by EMS, of whom 41 (53.2%) patients entered PNP. Compared with non-EMS group, EMS without PNP group greatly shortened the onset to door time (ODT), but EMS with PNP group showed both a significantly shorter DNT (41.3 ± 10.7 min vs 51.9±23.8 min, t=2.583, p=0.012) and ODT (133.2 ± 90.2 min vs 174.8 ± 105.1 min, t=2.228, p=0.027) than non-EMS group. Multivariate analysis showed that the use of EMS with PNP (OR=2.613, p=0.036), but not EMS (OR=1.865, p=0.103), was independently associated with good outcome after adjusting for age and baseline NIHSS score. When adding ONT into the regression model, ONT (OR=0.994, p=0.001), but not EMS with PNP (OR=1.785, p=0.236), was independently associated with good outcome. EMS with PNP, rather than EMS only, improved stroke outcome by shortening ONT. PNP could be a feasible strategy for better stroke care in Chinese urban area.",

To address this issue, 6-month-old and 16-month-old female mice were fed a 3% cholesterol diet for 8 weeks, followed by hippocampus-related functional, pathological, biochemical and molecular analyses. The high cholesterol diet did not exacerbate age-dependent cognitive decline and hippocampal neuronal death, and even greatly mitigated decreases of synaptophysin and growth associated protein 43 expression in the hippocampus of aged mice. Compared with young controls, aged mice fed normal diet showed mild activation of hippocampal microglia with increased expression of CD68, a marker of the microglial M1 phenotype, and decreased expression of CD206, a marker of the microglial M2 phenotype. More interestingly, the high cholesterol diet not only improved NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β expression, but also increased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-6 in the hippocampus of old mice, suggesting playing pro- and anti-neuroinflammatory effects. In addition, the cholesterol rich diet resulted in a defect of the blood-brain barrier of aged hippocampus, as revealed by increased brain albumin content. These results have revealed both harmful and protective effects of high cholesterol diet on aged brain, which helps us to understand that hypercholesterolemia in the aged population is not associated with dementia and cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "Evidence has been accumulating that zinc ions can trigger β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition and senile plaque formation in the brain, a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Chelating zinc inhibits Aβ aggregation and may hold promise as a therapeutic strategy for AD. S100A6 is an acidic Ca2+/Zn2+-binding protein found only in a small number of astrocytes in the normal brain. However, in the AD brain, S100A6 is highly expressed in astrocytes around Aβ plaques. The role of the astrocytic S100A6 upregulation in AD is unknown. In the present study, we examined the effects of S100A6 on Aβ plaques and intracellular zinc levels in a mouse model of AD. Chronic exposure to zinc increased Aβ deposition and S100A6 expression, both reversible by the zinc chelator clioquinol, in the brains of amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice. To examine whether exogenous S100A6 could induce Aβ plaque disaggregation through competition for zinc in vitro, we incubated APP/PS1 mouse brain sections with recombinant human S100A6 protein or co-incubated them with human S100A6-expressing cells. Both treatments efficiently reduced the Aβ plaque burden in situ. In addition, treatment with exogenous S100A6 protected cultured COS-7 cells against zinc toxicity. Our results show for the first time that increased S100A6 levels correlate with both Aβ disaggregation and decrease of Aβ plaque-associated zinc contents in brain sections with AD-like pathology. Astrocytic S100A6 in AD may protect from Aβ deposition through zinc sequestration.",

Several structural and functional changes occur in the cardiovascular system during the aging process and the mechanisms involved in such alterations are yet to be completely described. BK channels are transmembrane proteins that play a key role in many physiological processes, including regulation of vascular tone. In vascular smooth muscle cells, BK opening and the consequent efflux of potassium (K(+)) leads to membrane hyperpolarization, which is followed by the closure of voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels, reduction of Ca(2+) entry and vasodilatation. BK regulates nitric oxide-mediated vasodilatation and thus is crucial for normal endothelial function. Herein we will briefly review general structural properties of BK and focus on their function in the cardiovascular system emphasizing their role in cardiovascular aging and diseases.",

AMD is a vision threatening retinal disease that affects the aging population world-wide. Retinal pigment epithelium and choroid in the posterior part of the retina are the key tissues targeted in the pathogenesis of CNV in AMD. We used human retinal pigment epithelial (HRPE) and choroidal fibroblast (HCHF) cells, prepared from aged adult human donor eyes, to evaluate the expression of major CCR-3 ligands, CCL-5, CCL -7, CCL-11,CCL-24 and CCL-26. Microarray analysis of gene expression in HRPE cells treated with inflammatory cytokine mix (ICM= IFN-γ+TNF-α+IL-1β) revealed 75 and 23-fold increase in CCL-5 and CCL-7 respectively, but not CCL-11, CCL-24 and CCL-26. Chemokine secretion studies of the production of CCL5 and CCL7 by HRPE corroborated with the gene expression analysis data. When the HRPE cells were treated with either individual cytokines or the ICM, both CCL-5 and CCL-7 were produced in a dose dependent manner. Similar to the gene expression data, the ICM did not enhance HRPE production of CCL-11, CCL-24 and CCL-26. CCL-11 and CCL-26 were increased with IL-4 treatment and this HRPE production was augmented in the presence of TNF-α and IL1β. When HCHF cells were treated with either individual cytokines or the ICM, both CCL-5 and CCL-7 were produced in a dose dependent fashion. IL-4 induced low levels of CCL-11 and CCL-26 in HCHF and this production was significantly enhanced by TNF-α. Under these conditions, neither HRPE nor HCHF were demonstrated to produce CCL-24. These data demonstrate that chronic inflammation triggers CCL-5 and CCL-7 release by HRPE and HCHF and the subsequent interactions with CCR3 may participate in pathologic processes in AMD.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of cognitive impairment using three cognitive abilities (verbal fluency, numeracy and perceived memory) and their association with cardiovascular risk factors in seniors across Europe. Data from participants in wave 4 of the SHARE (Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe) database was used. Cognitive performance in perceived memory, verbal fluency and numeracy was evaluated using simple tests and a memory complaints questionnaire. Clinical and sociodemographic variables were also studied for potential associations. Standardised prevalence rates of cognitive impairment based on age and gender were calculated by country. The prevalence of cognitive impairment was 28.02% for perceived memory, 27.89% for verbal fluency and 20.75% for numeracy throughout the 16 evaluated countries. Years of education, being a current or former smoker, number of chronic diseases, diabetes or hyperglycemia, heart attack and stroke were all independent variables associated with impairment in the three studied cognitive abilities. We also found independent associations between physical inactivity and verbal fluency and numeracy impairment, as well as hypertension and perceived memory impairment. Lower performance in the evaluated cognitive abilities and higher memory complaints are highly prevalent, have a heterogeneous distribution across Europe, and are associated with multiple factors, most of which are potentially preventable or treatable, especially cardiovascular risk factors.",

However, many studies have shown that bone strength, and consequently the probability of fracture, is a combination of both bone mass and bone 'quality' (architecture and material chemistry). Although the microarchitecture of both non-fracture and osteoporotic bone has been previously investigated, many of the osteoporotic studies are constrained by factors such as limited sample number, use of ovariectomised animal models, and lack of male and female discrimination. This study reports significant differences in bone quality with respect to the microarchitecture between fractured and non-fractured human femur specimens. Micro-computed tomography was utilised to investigate the microarchitecture of femoral head trabecular bone from a relatively large cohort of non-fracture and fracture human donors. Various microarchitectural parameters have been determined for both groups, providing an understanding of the differences between fracture and non -fracture material. The microarchitecture of non-fracture and fracture bone tissue is shown to be significantly different for many parameters. Differences between sexes also exist, suggesting differences in remodelling between males and females in the fracture group. The results from this study will, in the future, be applied to develop a fracture model which encompasses bone density, architecture and material chemical properties for both female and male tissues.",

    "abstract": "Aging is an inevitable physiological challenge occurring in organisms over time, and is also the most important risk factor of neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we observed cellular and molecular changes of different age mice and LPS-induced Parkinson disease (PD) model. The results showed that behavioral performance and dopaminergic (DA) neurons were declined, accompanied by increased expression of pro-inflammatory factors (TLR2, p-NF-kB-p65, IL-1β and TNF-α), as well as pro-oxidative stress factor gp91phox in aged mice compared with young mice. Aging exaggerated inflammatory M1 microglia, and destroyed the balance between oxidation and anti-oxidation. The intranasal LPS instillation induced PD model in both young and aged mice. The poor behavioral performance and the loss of DA neurons as well as TLR2, p-NF-kB-p65, IL-1β, TNF-α, iNOS and gp91phox were further aggravated in LPS-aged mice. Interestingly, the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 was up-regulated by LPS only in young LPS-PD mice, but not in aged mice. The results indicate that the synergy of aging process and LPS exposure may prominently aggravate the DA neurons loss caused by more serious neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in the brain.",

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress appears to play a critical role in the progression of PD. We demonstrated that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), as a neurotropic factor, inhibited ER stress-induced neuronal cell apoptosis and that 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced ER stress was involved in the progression of PD in rats. bFGF administration improved motor function recovery, increased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neuron survival, and upregulated the levels of neurotransmitters in PD rats. The 6-OHDA-induced ER stress response proteins were inhibited by bFGF treatment. Meanwhile, bFGF also increased expression of TH. The administration of bFGF activated the downstream signals PI3K/Akt and Erk1/2 in vivo and in vitro. Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt and Erk1/2 pathways by specific inhibitors partially reduced the protective effect of bFGF. This study provides new insight towards bFGF translational drug development for PD involving the regulation of ER stress.",

All these mutations caused dementia with the mean onset age of 38.3 (range from 27 to 51) and rapid progression. Eleven variants with uncertain significance were also detected and needed further verification. The clinical phenotypes of dementia are heterogeneous, with both onset ages and clinical features being influenced by mutation position as well as the causative gene.

EndoMT is hypothesized to contribute to the over-proliferation of αSMA positive cells. We aim to investigate the potential role of Gal-3 in regulating EndoMT in PAH. We observed an upregulation in both Gal-3 and αSMA expression in the monocrotaline (MCT) and Hypoxia PAH model, accompanied with intimal thickening. For more profound vascular remodeling and endothelial layer lesion in former model, we employed Gal-3 knockdown and overexpression lentivirus methodology to the MCT rats to determine the mechanisms underlying abnormal endothelial cell transition in PAH. PAH was evaluated according to right ventricular systolic pressure, right heart hypertrophy and pulmonary artery remodeling. A reduction in Gal-3 was protective against the development of PAH, while Gal-3 upregulation aggravated pulmonary vascular occlusion. In addition, Gal-3 deficiency suppressed pulmonary vascular cell proliferation and macrophage infiltration. Finally, we revealed that in endothelial cells treated with tumor necrosis factor α and hypoxia (representing an in vitro model of PAH), inhibition of Gal-3 by siRNA was able to abolish the associated upregulation of αSMA. These observations suggesting Gal-3 serves as a critical mediator in PAH by regulating EndoMT. Inhibition of Gal-3 may represent a novel therapeutic target for PAH treatment.",

Our results showed that Tat-CDK5-CTM blocked the CDK5-NR2B interaction, resulting in the degradation of CDK5, which in turn prevented calcium overload and neuronal death in cultured neurons. Tat-CDK5-CTM also reduced the infarction area and neuronal loss and improved the neurological functions in MCAO (Middle cerebral artery occlusion) mice.

In spite of considerable progress in identifying the genetic and biochemical basis of PD, to date the diagnosis remains clinical and disease-modifying therapies continue to be elusive. A cornerstone in recent PD research is the investigation of biological markers that could help in identifying at-risk population or to track disease progression and response to therapies. Although none of these parameters has been validated for routine clinical practice yet, however some biochemical candidates hold great promise for application in PD patients, especially in the early stages of disease, and it is likely that in the future the diagnosis of PD will require a combination of genetic, imaging and laboratory data. In this review we discuss the most interesting biochemical markers for PD (including the \"-omics\" techniques), focusing on the methodological challenges in using <i>ex vivo</i> blood/CSF/tissue-based biomarkers and suggesting alternative strategies to overcome the difficulties that still prevent their actual use.",

These adaptations in body composition may lead to several cardio-metabolic disorders that reduce the quality of life, increase patients' and caregivers' burden and eventually leads to mortality. Exercise, an appropriate dietary regimen, and an active lifestyle may alleviate several of the negative effects on body composition after a SCI. Today however, there is no established consensus on the recommended dose, frequency or type of exercise to ameliorate several of the body composition sequelae after an acute SCI. Resistance training has been previously recommended as an effective strategy to restore soft tissue LM and decrease fat mass (FM). The strategy can be simply implemented as a routine home-based training program using free weights or resistance bands after a SCI. Additionally, upper extremity (UE) circuit resistance training has been previously used to improve cardiovascular and metabolic parameters after a SCI; however compared to the vast knowledge regarding the able-bodied (AB) population, the effects of UE circuit resistance training on body composition after a SCI is not well established. In summary, the available evidence does not support the rationale that UE circuit resistance training can lead to positive adaptations in body composition after a SCI. Further studies are suggested to examine the effects of UE circuit resistance training on body composition.",

It was introduced to improve screening for geriatric conditions. We conducted this study to explore the relationship between self-reported geriatric symptoms and hospitalization and emergency department (ED) visits within 1 year of completing the survey. This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who completed the MAGE from April 2008 to December 2010. The primary outcome was an ED visit or hospitalization within 1 year. Predictors included responses to individual questions in the MAGE. Data were obtained from the electronic medical record and administrative records. Logistic regression analyses were performed from significant univariate factors to determine predictors in a multivariable setting. A weighted scoring system was created based upon the odds ratios derived from a bootstrap process. The sensitivity, specificity, and AUC were calculated using this scoring system. The MAGE survey was completed by 7738 patients. The average age was 76.2 ± 7.68 years and 57% were women. Advanced age, a self-report of worse health, history of 2 or more falls, weight loss, and depressed mood were significantly associated with hospitalization or ED visits within 1 year.

One of the participating enzyme systems in ECM turnover is matrix metalloproteinases. A disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motifs (ADAMTS) is a unique family of ECM proteases found in mammals. Components of this family may be distinguished from the ADAM (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase) family based on the multiple copies of thrombospondin 1-like repeats. The considerable role of the ADAMTS in the CNS continues to develop. Evidences indicate that ADAMTS play an important role in neuroplasticity as well as nervous system pathologies such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). It is hopeful and possible that ADAMTS family members may be utilized to develop therapies for CNS pathologies, ischemic injuries, neurodegenerative and neurological diseases. To understand and provide definitive data on ADAMTS to improve structural and functional recovery in CNS injury and diseases, this review aimed to enlighten the subject extensively to reach certain information on metalloproteinases and related molecules/enzymes. It will be interesting to examine how ADAMTS expression and action would affect the initiation/progression of above-mentioned clinical situations, especially AD.",

    "abstract": "Elderly pneumonia patients have various underlying diseases and social backgrounds, and it is difficult to predict their mortality using the current severity assessment tools. However, aspiration is a risk factor for mortality in pneumonia patients. In the evaluation of aspiration, endoscopic and video fluoroscopic methods are reliable but cannot be performed in all pneumonia patients. We evaluated the significance of the Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability (MASA) in these patients. This study was prospectively performed between December 2014 and June 2015, and all adult hospitalized patients with pneumonia were consecutively enrolled. The MASA score was evaluated soon after admission. The outcome measures were in-hospital mortality, a recurrence of pneumonia within 30 days, 6-month mortality, and the detection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. A total of 153 patients were ultimately included. The proportion of in-hospital mortality was greater among the severe MASA score patients than normal score patients (p < 0.01), as was the proportion of recurrence of pneumonia (p < 0.01) and 6-month mortality (p < 0.01). In addition, patients with a moderate MASA score more often experienced recurrence of pneumonia than normal score patients (p < 0.05). Furthermore, patients with a mild MASA score more often experienced recurrence of pneumonia (p < 0.01) and 6-month mortality (p < 0.05) than normal score patients. The areas under the curve were 0.74 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67-0.82) for in-hospital mortality, 0.75 (95% CI, 0.68-0.82) for recurrence of pneumonia, 0.72 (95% Cl, 0.64-0.81) for 6-month mortality, and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.46-0.73) for detection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. A multivariate analysis showed an abnormal MASA score to be an independent risk factor for the recurrence of pneumonia (p = 0.001) and 6-month mortality (p = 0.005). The MASA is useful for predicting the mortality and recurrence of pneumonia in elderly patients.",

Upregulation of SDF-1/CXCR4/CXCR7 chemokine signaling in the ischemic regions has been well-documented in the animal models of ischemic stroke, but not in human ischemic brain. Here, we found that protein expression of SDF-1 and CXCR7, but not CXCR4, were significantly increased in the cortical peri-infarct regions (penumbra) after ischemic stroke in human, compared with adjacent normal tissues and control subjects. Double-label fluorescence immunohistochemistry shows that SDF-1 and CXCR4 proteins were expressed in neuronal cells and astrocytes in the normal brain tissue and peri-infarct regions. CXCR7 protein was also observed in neuronal cells and astrocytes in the normal cortical regions, but predominantly in astrocytes in the penumbra of ischemic brain. Our data suggest that ischemic stroke in human leads to an increase in the expression of SDF-1 and CXCR7, but not CXCR4, in the peri-infarct cerebral cortex. Our findings suggest that chemokine SFD-1 is expressed not only in animal models of stroke, but also in the human brain after an ischemic injury. In addition, unlike animals, CXCR7 may be the primary receptor of SDF-1 in human stroke brain.",

Our inclusion criterion in this study is only that participants can walk without any assistance. This study included three heterogeneous groups; patients who underwent a tap test or shunt surgery, 29 inpatients hospitalized for other reasons, and 87 day-care users. After the tap test, 28 were diagnosed with tap-positive idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) and 8 were diagnosed with tap-negative. Additionally, 18 patients were assessed iTUG before and after shunt surgery. During iTUG, time and 3-dimensional (3D) acceleration were automatically recorded every 0.01 s. A volume of the 95% confidence ellipsoid (95%CE) of all plots for 3D acceleration was calculated. Additionally, an iTUG score was defined as (95%CE volume) 0.8 / 1.9 - 1.9 × (time) + 60. The measurement reliability was evaluated using intraclass correlations and Bland-Altman plots. The participants with mild gait disturbance who accomplished within 13.5 s on the iTUG time had the 95%CE volumes for 3D acceleration of ≥70 m3/s6 and iTUG scores of ≥50. The mean iTUG time was shortened and the mean 95%CE volumes and iTUG scores were increased after the tap test among 28 patients with tap-positive iNPH and after shunt surgery among 18 patients with definite iNPH. Conversely, the mean iTUG score among 8 patients with tap-negative was decreased after the tap test. The intraclass correlations for the time, 95%CE volume and iTUG score were 0.97, 0.80 and 0.90, respectively. Not only the iTUG time but also the 95%CE volume was important for evaluating mobility.

    "abstract": "Aging may aggravate the damage and dysfunction of different components of multiorgan and thus increasing multiorgan ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury. IR injury occurs in many organs and tissues, which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), an atypical serine/threonine protein kinase, involves in the pathophysiological process of IR injury. In this review, we first briefly introduce the molecular features of mTOR, the association between mTOR and aging, and especially its role on autophagy. Special focus is placed on the roles of mTOR during ischemic and IR injury. We then clarify the association between mTOR and conditioning phenomena. Following this background, we expand our discussion to potential future directions of research in this area. Collectively, information reviewed herein will serve as a comprehensive reference for the actions of mTOR in IR injury and may be significant for the design of future research and increase the potential of mTOR as a therapeutic target.",

Four patients died during 3 months after stroke onset. Successful recanalization with thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) score ≥2b was achieved in 75 of 81 patients (92.6%) after mechanical thrombectomy. The average number of passes with Solitaire stent retriever was 1.3. At 3 months, 55 of 81 patients (67.9%) had favorable outcomes (mRS<=2). The intravenous application of a standard dose of tirofiban post-Solitaire stent retriever thrombectomy and intravenous thrombolysis appears to be safe and relatively effective in acute ischemic stroke.",

Immunohistochemistry and synchrotron radiation microangiography were performed to examine the number of newly formed blood vessels in both young adult and aged rats post-ischemia. We found that the number of capillaries and small arteries in aged brain was the same as young adult brain. In addition, we found that after MCAO, the number of blood vessels in the peri-infarct region of ipsilateral hemisphere in aged ischemic rats was significantly increased compared to the aged sham rats (p<0.05). We also confirmed that ischemia-induced focal angiogenesis occurred in young adult rat brain while the blood vessel density in young adult ischemic brain was significantly higher than that in the aged ischemic brain (p<0.05). Our data suggests that focal angiogenesis in aged rat brain can be induced in response to ischemic brain injury, and that aging impedes brain repairing and remodeling after ischemic stroke, possible due to the limited response of angiogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Mild therapeutic hypothermia, a robust neuroprotectant, reduces neuronal apoptosis, but the precise mechanism is not well understood. Our previous study showed that a novel inhibitor of an apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 (iASPP) might be involved in neuronal death after stroke. The aim of this study was to confirm the role of iASPP after stroke treated with mild therapeutic hypothermia. To address this, we mimicked ischemia/reperfusion injury in vitro by using oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) in primary rat neurons. In our in vivo approach, we induced middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 60 min in C57/B6 mice. From the beginning of ischemia, focal mild hypothermia was applied for two hours. To evaluate the role of iASPP, small interfering RNA (siRNA) was injected intracerebroventricularly. Our results showed that mild therapeutic hypothermia increased the expression of iASPP and decreased the expression of its targets, Puma and Bax, and an apoptosis marker, cleaved caspase-3, in primary neurons under OGD/R. Increased iASPP expression and decreased ASPP1/2 expression were observed under hypothermia treatment in MCAO mice. iASPP siRNA (iASPPi) or hypothermia plus iASPPi application increased infarct volume, apoptosis and aggravated the neurological deficits in MCAO mice. Furthermore, iASPPi downregulated iASPP expression, and upregulated the expression of proapoptotic effectors, Puma, Bax and cleaved caspase-3, in mice after stroke treated with mild therapeutic hypothermia. In conclusion, mild therapeutic hypothermia protects against ischemia/reperfusion brain injury in mice by upregulating iASPP and thus attenuating apoptosis. iASPP may be a potential target in the therapy of stroke.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease mainly affecting upper and lower motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Pathogenesis of ALS is still unclear, and a multifactorial etiology is presumed. The remarkable clinical heterogeneity between different phenotypes of ALS patients suggests that environmental and lifestyle factors could play a role in onset and progression of ALS. We analyzed a cohort of 117 ALS patients and 93 controls. ALS patients and controls were compared regarding physical activity, dietary habits, smoking, residential environment, potentially toxic environmental factors and profession before symptom onset and throughout the disease course. Data were collected by a personal interview. For statistical analysis descriptive statistics, statistical tests and analysis of variance were used. ALS patients and controls did not differ regarding smoking, diet and extent of physical training. No higher frequency of toxic influences could be detected in the ALS group. ALS patients lived in rural environment considerably more often than the control persons, but this was not associated with a higher percentage of occupation in agriculture. There was also a higher percentage of university graduates in the ALS group. Patients with bulbar onset were considerably more often born in an urban environment as compared to spinal onset. Apart from education and environment, ALS phenotypes did not differ in any investigated environmental or life-style factor. The rate of disease progression was not influenced by any of the investigated environmental and life-style factors. The present study could not identify any dietary habit, smoking, physical activity, occupational factor as well as toxic influences as risk factor or protective factor for onset or progression of ALS. Living in rural environment and higher education might be associated with higher incidence of ALS.",

However, whether limb remote ischemic conditioning (LRIC) has beneficial effects on diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains unknown. This study aims to investigate the protective effects of LRIC in retinal ganglion cell in streptozotocin (STZ) induced Type 1 diabetic rats. A total of 48 healthy male Sprague-Dawley (200-220g) rats were randomly assigned to the normal group, normal+LRIC group, diabetes mellitus (DM) group and DM+LRIC group. Streptozotocin (STZ, 60 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected into the rats to establish the diabetic model. LRIC was conducted by tightening a tourniquet around the upper thigh and releasing for three cycles daily (10 mins x 3 cycles). Retinas were harvested after 12 weeks of LRIC treatment for histopathologic, Western blot and ELISA analysis. Plasma were collected at the same time for ELISA analysis. LRIC alleviated diabetic retinopathy symptoms as evidenced by the increased number of retinal ganglion cells (P<0.01) and decreased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression level (P<0.01) in the rat retina. LRIC in DM rats exhibited anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects as confirmed by the down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine: interleukin-6 (IL-6), and the up-regulation of antioxidants: superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione (GSH)/oxidized glutathione (GSSG). Furthermore, LRIC significantly downregulated VEGF protein expression in the retina (P<0.01). These results suggest that the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activities of LRIC may be important mechanisms involved in the protective effect of LRIC in STZ-induced diabetic rats.",

Age at diagnosis of advanced NSCLC is much older, but studies describing the practice patterns for octogenarians with distant metastasis NSCLC are limited. A retrospective, population-based study using national representative data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program was conducted to evaluate 34 882 NSCLC patients with extrathoracic metastases from 2010 to 2013. Patients were classified into three groups (older group: ≥80 yrs, middle-aged group: 60-79 yrs, and younger group: ≤59 yrs). The role of different age at diagnosis of NSCLC in metastasis patterns was investigated, and survival of different age groups of metastatic NSCLC was assessed. The analysis revealed that older patients were more likely to only have bone or liver metastasis (p< 0.001), but less likely to have brain only metastasis (p<0.001) and multiple metastatic sites (p< 0.001) than other two groups. Age at diagnosis was an independent risk factor for different metastasis types. Older group had the worst overall survival (p<0.001) and cancer-specific survival (p<0.001). Furthermore, older age patients with only bone metastasis had the best cancer specific survival (p<0.05) while younger patients with only brain metastasis had the best prognosis (p<0.001). Over 60% octogenarians with metastatic NSCLC did not receive anti-cancer therapy and had the highest rate of cancer deaths among all patients. Our results may help clinicians make positive decisions regarding personalized treatment of metastatic NSCLC in the elderly.",

We aimed to identify the characteristics and underlying causes of T2MI using a comprehensive geriatric approach. From a multicentre population-based prospective study in coronary care units, we adjudicated 4572 consecutive patients hospitalized for an acute T1MI or T2MI, according to the 3<sup>rd</sup> universal definition and a prespecified geriatric model of T2MI pathogenesis. In total, 3710 (81%) had T1MI and 862 (19%) T2MI. Patients with T2MI were 10 y older (77 vs 67 y, p<0.001), more frequently female (44 vs 26%, p<0.001) and had more frequent comorbidities. In multivariate analysis, acute heart failure, tachycardia and C-reactive protein elevation at admission were associated with a higher risk of T2MI vs T1MI, whereas chest pain, troponin I peak > 10 µg/L and ST-segment elevation were associated with a lower risk. Underlying mechanisms leading to T2MI highlighted 3 main patterns: 1) Age-related physiological cardiovascular decline 2) chronic predisposing factors including chronic anaemia (10%) and severe aortic stenosis (7%), 3) acute triggering factors, the most common being acute infection (39%), mainly respiratory tract infection, followed by tachyarrhythmia (13%) and acute heart failure (10%). 122 (14%) patients had combined predisposing and triggering conditions for T2MI. In our large population-based survey of T2MI, chronic anaemia and severe aortic stenosis increased predisposition to T2MI and acute respiratory infection was by far the most frequent trigger. Our data shed new light on the age-related pathophysiological basis for discrepancies in oxygen supply and demand leading to MI.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have focused on the general population. However, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a common comorbidity that has rarely been investigated in detail. This study aims to describe clinical characteristics and determine risk factors for intensive care unit (ICU) admission of COVID-19 patients with CVD. In this retrospective cohort study, we included 288 adult patients with COVID-19 in Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital from January 15, 2020 to March 10, 2020. Demographic characteristics, laboratory results, radiographic findings, complications, and treatments were recorded and compared between CVD and non-CVD groups. A binary logistic regression model was used to identify risk factors associated with ICU admission for infected patients with underlying CVD. COVID-19 patients in the CVD group were older and had higher levels of troponin I (TnI), C-reactive protein (CRP), and creatinine. They were also more prone to develop into severe or critically severe cases, receive ICU admission, and require respiratory support treatment. Multivariate regression analysis showed that the following were risk factors for ICU admission in COVID-19 patients with CVD: each 1-year increase in age (odds ratio (OR), 1.08; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.17; p = 0.018); respiratory rate over 24 times per min (OR, 25.52; 95% CI, 5.48-118.87; p < 0.0001); CRP higher than 10 mg/L (OR, 8.12; 95% CI, 1.63-40.49; p = 0.011); and TnI higher than 0.03 μg/L (OR, 9.14; 95% CI, 2.66-31.43; p < 0.0001). Older age, CRP greater than 10 mg/L, TnI higher than 0.03 μg/L, and respiratory rate over 24 times per minute were associated with increasing odds of ICU admission in COVID-19 patients with CVD. Investigating and monitoring these factors could assist in the risk stratification of COVID-19 patients with CVD at an early stage.",

    "abstract": "As the population ages, the occurrence of chronic pathologies becomes more common. Leukocyte telomere shortening associates to ageing and age-related diseases. Recent studies suggest that environmental chemicals can affect telomere length. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are most relevant, since they are ingested with foods, and accumulate in the body for a long time. This longitudinal study was undertaken to test if circulating POPs predict telomere length and shortening in elderly people. We studied 1082 subjects belonging to the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study (born 1934-1944), undergoing two visits (2001-2004 and 2011-2014). POPs (oxychlordane, trans-nonachlor, p, p'-DDE, PCB 153, BDE 47, BDE 153) were analysed at baseline. Relative telomere length was measured twice, '10 years apart, by quantitative real-time PCR. Oxychlordane, trans-nonachlor and PCB-153 levels were significant predictors of telomere length and shortening. In men, we did not find a linear relationship between POPs exposure and telomere shortening. In women, a significant reduction across quartiles categories of oxychlordane and trans-nonachlor exposure was observed. Baseline characteristics of subjects in the highest POPs categories included higher levels of C-reactive protein and fasting glucose, and lower body fat percentage. This is one of few studies combining POPs and telomere length. Our results indicate that exposure to oxychlordane, trans-nonachlor and PCB 153 predicts telomere attrition. This finding is important because concentrations of POPs observed here occur in contemporary younger people, and may contribute to an accelerated ageing.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac function of the human heart changes with age. The age-related change of systolic function is subtle under normal conditions, but abrupt under stress or in a pathogenesis state. Aging decreases the cardiac tolerance to stress and increases susceptibility to ischemia, which caused by aging-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient impairment and metabolic dysfunction. The changes of contractility proteins and the relative molecules are in a non-linear fashion. Specifically, the expression and activation of cMLCK increase first then fall during ischemia and reperfusion (I/R). This change is responsible for the nonmonotonic contractility alteration in I/R which the underlying mechanism is still unclear. Contractility recovery in I/R is also attenuated by age. The age-related change in cardiac contractility influences the therapeutic effect and intervention timepoint. For most cardiac ischemia therapies, the therapeutic result in the elderly is not identical to the young. Anti-aging treatment has the potential to prevent the development of ischemic injury and improves cardiac function. In this review we discuss the mechanism underlying the contractility changes in the aged heart and age-induced ischemic injury. The potential mechanism underlying the increased susceptibility to ischemic injury in advanced age is highlighted. Furthermore, we discuss the effect of age and the administration time for intervention in cardiac ischemia therapies.",

    "abstract": "Circulating factors associated with aging have been shown to be involved in the development of age-related chronic and acute brain diseases. Here, we aimed to investigate the roles and mechanisms of CCL12, a circulating factor that is highly expressed in the plasma of aged rodents after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) using parabiosis and ICH models. Neurological deficit score (NDS), mortality rate, brain water content (BWC), and levels of inflammatory factors were determined to assess the degree of ICH-induced brain injury. Peripheral inflammatory cell infiltration was examined using immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. After confirming that acute brain injury after ICH was aggravated with age, we found that brain and plasma CCL12 levels were markedly higher in old mice than in young mice after ICH, and that plasma CCL12 was able to enter the brain. Using CCL12-/- mice, we showed that the degree of damage in the brain-as determined by NDS, mortality rate, BWC, levels of inflammatory factors, and numbers of degenerative and apoptotic neural cells and surviving neurons was significantly attenuated compared to that observed in old wild-type (WT) mice. These effects were reversed in CCL12-treated old mice. The detrimental effects caused by CCL12 may involve its ability to recruit macrophages and T cells. Finally, the administration of an anti-CCL12 antibody markedly improved the outcomes of ICH mice. Our results are the first to indicate that elevated peripheral CCL12 levels in old mice aggravates ICH-induced brain injury by recruiting macrophages and T cells. Thus, CCL12 may be a new target for ICH treatment.",

    "abstract": "The 2019-2020 SARS-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to healthcare sectors around the world. As of November 2020, there have been over 64 million confirmed cases and approaching 2 million deaths globally. Despite the large number of positive cases, there are very limited established standards of care and therapeutic options available. To date, there is still no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved vaccine for COVID-19, although there are several options in various clinical trial stages. Herein, we have performed a global review evaluating the roles of age and sex on COVID-19 hospitalizations, ICU admissions, deaths in hospitals, and deaths in nursing homes. We have identified a trend in which elderly and male patients are significantly affected by adverse outcomes. There is evidence suggesting that sex hormone levels can influence immune system function against SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus reducing the adverse effects of COVID-19. Since older adults have lower levels of these sex hormones, we therefore speculate, within rational scientific context, that sex steroids, such as estrogen and progesterone, needs further consideration for use as alternative therapeutic option for treating COVID-19 elderly patients. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive article evaluating the significance of sex hormones in COVID-19 outcomes in older adults.",

    "abstract": "Acute ischemic stroke due to basilar artery occlusion (BAO) carries a very poor prognosis. Functional outcomes in BAO patients undergoing endovascular therapy (EVT) may differ according to the specific pathological mechanisms. We aimed to explore the impact of the underlying pathological mechanisms on prognosis at 90-days and long-term follow-up in BAO patients treated with EVT. We analyzed consecutive BAO patients undergoing EVT from December 2012 to December 2018 at a single center (Xuanwu Hospital). Patients were classified into either an intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) group or an embolic group according to the corresponding angiographic findings. The baseline characteristics and functional outcomes were compared between the two groups. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed. Among the 167 patients enrolled, 78 patients (46.7%) were in the ICAD group and 89 patients (53.3%) were assigned to the embolic group. Overall, 149 patients (89.2%) achieved successful reperfusion post-EVT. There were no significant differences in functional outcomes at 90-days and long-term follow-up between the two groups. Similarly, a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed similar long-term survival probabilities (P = 0.438). The pathological mechanism was not associated with functional independence (OR, 1.818; 95% CI, 0.694-4.761; P = 0.224), favorable outcome (OR, 1.476; 95% CI, 0.592-3.681; P = 0.403), or mortality (OR, 1.249; 95% CI, 0.483-3.226; P = 0.646). However, based on subgroup analysis, embolic BAO versus ICAD was significantly associated with better functional independence in those aged 60 years and younger (OR, 4.513; 95% CI, 1.138-17.902). In this study, no differences in either 90-days or long-term functional outcomes between ICAD-related BAO and embolic BAO patients undergoing EVT were observed. However, in BAO patients aged ≤ 60 years, the pathological mechanism of embolism was associated with better functional independence.",

Here, using the next-generation of RNA sequencing we find a total of 778 genes increasingly expressed in brain of stroke mice. Of these, we identified Hmgb2 as a microglia pro-inflammatory mediator by promoting the transcription of Ctss. Inhibition of either Hmgb2 or Ctss blocks microglia pro-inflammatory response and protects against brain damages and improves the neurological functions of stroke mice.

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence is a biological process triggered in response to time-accumulated DNA damage, which prioritizes cell survival over cell function. Particularly, senescent T lymphocytes can be generated prematurely during chronic inflammatory diseases regardless of chronological aging. These senescent T lymphocytes are characterized by the loss of CD28 expression, a co-stimulatory receptor that mediates antigen presentation and effective T-cell activation. An increased number of premature senescent CD4+CD28- T lymphocytes has been frequently observed in osteolytic diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomyelitis. Indeed, CD4+CD28- T lymphocytes produce higher levels of osteoclastogenic molecular mediators directly related to pathologic bone loss, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-17A, and receptor-activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL), as compared with regular CD4+CD28+ T lymphocytes. In addition, premature senescent CD8+CD28- T lymphocytes have been negatively associated with bone healing and regeneration by inhibiting osteoblast differentiation and mesenchymal stromal cell survival. Therefore, accumulated evidence supports the role of senescent T lymphocytes in osteoimmunology. Moreover, premature senescence of T-cells seems to be associated with the functional imbalance between the osteolytic T-helper type-17 (Th17) and bone protective T regulatory (Treg) lymphocytes, as well as the phenotypic instability of Treg lymphocytes responsible for its trans-differentiation into RANKL-producing exFoxp3Th17 cells, a key cellular phenomenon directly related to bone loss. Herein, we present a framework for the understanding of the pathogenic characteristics of T lymphocytes with a premature senescent phenotype; and particularly, we revise and discuss their role in the osteoimmunology of osteolytic diseases.",

These variants are getting challenging to contain from spreading worldwide. Because of these variants, the second wave has started in various countries and is threatening human civilization. Thus, we require efficient vaccines that can combat all emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we took the initiative to develop a peptide-based next-generation vaccine using four variants (Wuhan variant, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B.1.1.28) that could potentially combat SARS-CoV-2 variants. We applied a series of computational tools, servers, and software to identify the most significant epitopes present on the mutagenic regions of SARS-CoV-2 variants. The immunoinformatics approaches were used to identify common B cell derived T cell epitopes, influencing the host immune system. Consequently, to develop a novel vaccine candidate, the antigenic epitopes were linked with a flexible and stable peptide linker, and the adjuvant was added at the N-terminal end. 3D vaccine candidate structure was refined, and quality was assessed using web servers. The physicochemical properties and safety parameters of the vaccine construct were assessed through bioinformatics and immunoinformatics tools. The molecular docking analysis between TLR4/MD2 and the proposed vaccine candidate demonstrated a satisfactory interaction. The molecular dynamics studies confirmed the stability of the vaccine candidate. Finally, we optimized the proposed vaccine through codon optimization and",

Previously developed treatments like anticholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists only provide short-term symptomatic improvement and do not prevent progression. Repeated setbacks and failures over the past 25 years in AD clinical trials have hindered efforts to develop effective AD treatments. Fortunately, Aducanumab, a specific anti-amyloid β antibody, has shown promising clinical results and was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through an accelerated approval pathway. This has raised hopes for AD patients; however post-approval trials are necessary to estimate the true scope of its clinical benefits. We have reviewed several AD clinical studies and summarized the experience to date with Aducanumab and two other potential AD drugs including Zagotenemab (an anti-tau antibody) and Pioglitazone (nuclear Peroxisome-Proliferator Activated Receptor γ (PPARγ) agonist). These have shown mixed results so far and the next few years will be critical to elucidate and interpret their broad long-term protective effects.

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder in the aging population and is characterized by a constellation of motor and non-motor symptoms. The abnormal aggregation and spread of alpha-synuclein (α-syn) is thought to underlie the loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), leading to the development of PD. It is in this context that the use of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) to express a-syn in the rodent midbrain has become a popular tool to model SNc DA neuron loss during PD. In this review, we summarize results from two decades of experiments using AAV-mediated a-syn expression in rodents to model PD. Specifically, we outline aspects of AAV vectors that are particularly relevant to modeling a-syn dysfunction in rodent models of PD such as changes in striatal neurochemistry, a-syn biochemistry, and PD-related behaviors resulting from AAV-mediated a-syn expression in the midbrain. Finally, we discuss the emerging role of astrocytes in propagating a-syn pathology, and point to future directions for employing AAVs as a tool to better understand how astrocytes contribute to a-syn pathology during the development of PD. We envision that lessons learned from two decades of utilizing AAVs to express a-syn in the rodent brain will enable us to develop an optimized set of parameters for gaining a better understanding of how a-syn leads to the development of PD.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic insufficiency and neuronal dysfunction occur in normal aging but is exaggerated in dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Metabolic insufficiency includes factors important for both substrate supply and utilization in the brain. Metabolic insufficiency occurs through a number of serial mechanisms, particularly changes in cerebrovascular supply through blood vessel abnormalities (ie, small and large vessel vasculopathy, stroke), alterations in neurovascular coupling providing dynamic blood flow supply in relation to neuronal demand, abnormalities in blood brain barrier including decreased glucose and amino acid transport, altered glymphatic flow in terms of substrate supply across the extracellular space to cells and drainage into CSF of metabolites, impaired transport into cells, and abnormal intracellular metabolism with more reliance on glycolysis and less on mitochondrial function. Recent studies have confirmed abnormal neurovascular coupling in a mouse model of AD in response to metabolic challenges, but the supply chain from the vascular system into neurons is disrupted much earlier in dementia than in equivalently aged individuals, contributing to the progressive neuronal degeneration and cognitive dysfunction associated with dementia. We discuss several metabolic treatment approaches, but these depend on characterizing patients as to who would benefit the most. Surrogate biomarkers of metabolism are being developed to include dynamic estimates of neuronal demand, sufficiency of neurovascular coupling, and glymphatic flow to supplement traditional static measurements. These surrogate biomarkers could be used to gauge efficacy of metabolic treatments in slowing down or modifying dementia time course.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is a biological process by which the central nervous system responds to stimuli/injuries affecting its homeostasis. So far as this reactive response becomes exacerbated and uncontrolled, it can lead to neurodegeneration, compromising the cognitive and neuropsychiatric domains. Parallelly, modifications in the hypothalamic signaling of neuroprotective hormones linked also to the inflammatory responses of microglia and astrocytes can exacerbate these processes. To complicate the picture, modulations in the gut microbiota (GM) can induce changes in neuroinflammation, altering cognitive and neuropsychiatric functioning. We conducted a web-based search on PubMed. We described studies regarding the cross-talk among microglia and astrocytes in the neuroinflammation processes, along with the role played by the steroid hormones, and how this can reflect on cognitive decline/neurodegeneration, in particular on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and its neuropsychiatric manifestations. We propose and support the huge literature showing the potentiality of complementary/alternative therapeutic approaches (nutraceuticals) targeting the sustained inflammatory response, the dysregulation of hypothalamic system and the GM composition. NF-κB and Keap1/Nrf2 are the main molecular targets on which a list of nutraceuticals can modulate the altered processes. Since there are some limitations, we propose a new intervention natural treatment in terms of Oxygen-ozone (O<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>3</sub>) therapy that could be potentially used for AD pathology. Through a meta-analytic approach, we found a significant modulation of O<sub>3</sub> on inflammation-NF-κB/NLRP3 inflammasome/Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4)/Interleukin IL-17α signalling, reducing mRNA (p<0.00001 Odd Ratio (OR)=-5.25 95% CI:-7.04/-3.46) and protein (p<0.00001 OR=-4.85 95%CI:-6.89/-2.81) levels, as well as on Keap1/Nrf2 pathway. Through anti-inflammatory, immune, and steroid hormones modulation and anti-microbial activities, O<sub>3</sub> at mild therapeutic concentrations potentiated with nutraceuticals and GM regulators could determine combinatorial effects impacting on cognitive and neurodegenerative domains, neuroinflammation and neuroendocrine signalling, directly or indirectly through the mediation of GM.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is a serious age-related pathology, and one of its hallmarks is the presence of chronic inflammation. Sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) is a cholesterol sensor that plays an essential role in regulating intracellular cholesterol homeostasis. Accordingly, dysregulation of the SCAP-SREBP pathway has been reported to be closely associated with an increased risk of obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and cardiovascular disease. In this study, we explored whether sterol-resistant SCAP (D443N mutation) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) of mice promotes vascular inflammation and accelerates the occurrence and progression of atherosclerosis. We established a transgenic knock-in mouse model of atherosclerosis with an activating D443N mutation at the sterol-sensing domain of SCAP (SCAPD443N) by microinjection. Next, SCAPD443N/ApoE-/- mice were generated by crossing SCAPD443N mice with apolipoprotein E-/- (ApoE-/-) background mice. We found that sterol-resistant SCAP markedly amplified and accelerated the progression of atherosclerotic plaques in SCAPD443N/ApoE-/- mice compared with that in control ApoE-/- mice. Similarly, in SCAPD443N mice, aortic atherosclerotic plaques both appeared earlier and were greater in number than that in control SCAP+/+ mice, both of which were fed a Western diet for 12 or 24 weeks. Moreover, we observed that sterol-resistant SCAP significantly increased local inflammation and induced endothelial dysfunction in the aortas of SCAPD443N mice and SCAPD443N/ApoE-/- mice. In vitro, we also found that sterol-resistant SCAP overexpression in VSMCs increased the release of inflammatory cytokines and induced endothelial cell injury when both cell types were cocultured. Furthermore, we demonstrated that sterol-resistant SCAP overexpression in VSMCs promoted SCAP and NLRP3 inflammasome cotranslocation to the Golgi and increased the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. These findings suggested that sterol-resistant SCAP in VSMCs of mice induced vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, consequently accelerating atherosclerosis by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is known to increase the susceptibility to various age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Although the role of damaged mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) in the progression of AD and PD has been identified, its relationship with altered expression of neurodegenerative proteins has not been examined before. This study aimed to investigate 1) how TBI could affect mitochondrial ETC and neurodegeneration in rat brain regions related to behavioral alteration, and 2) if administration of the key mitochondrial substrate pyruvate can improve the outcome of mild TBI (mTBI). In a rat lateral fluid percussion injury model of mTBI, sodium pyruvate in sterile distilled water (1 g/kg body weight) was administered orally daily for 7 days. The protein expression of mitochondrial ETC enzymes, and neurodegeneration proteins in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex and was assessed on Day 7. The hippocampal and cortical expressions of ETC complex I, III, IV, V were significantly and variably impaired following mTBI. Pyruvate treatment altered ETC complex expression, reduced the nitrosyl stress and the MBP expression in the injured brain area, but increased the expression of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and Tau proteins. Pyruvate after mTBI augmented the Rotarod performance but decreased the horizontal and vertical open field locomotion activities and worsened neurobehavioural severity score, indicating a debilitating therapeutic effect on the acute phase of mTBI. These results suggest bidirectional neuroprotective and neurodegenerative modulating effects of pyruvate on TBI-induced alteration in mitochondrial activity and motor behavior. Pyruvate could potentially stimulate the proliferation of astrogliosis, and lactate acidosis, and caution should be exercised when used as a therapy in the acute phase of mTBI. More effective interventions targeted at multiple mechanisms are needed for the prevention and treatment of TBI-induced long-term neurodegeneration.",

Over the past decades, a growing body of pathophysiological findings regarding WMLs have been discovered and discussed. Currently, the generally accepted WML pathogeneses mainly include hypoxia-ischemia, endothelial dysfunction, blood-brain barrier disruption, and infiltration of inflammatory mediators or cytokines. However, none of them can explain the whole dynamics of WML formation. Herein, we primarily focus on the pathogeneses and neuroimaging features of vascular WMLs. To achieve this goal, we searched papers with any type published in PubMed from 1950 to 2020 and cross-referenced the keywords including \"leukoencephalopathy\", \"leukoaraiosis\", \"white matter hyperintensity\", \"white matter lesion\", \"pathogenesis\", \"pathology\", \"pathophysiology\", and \"neuroimaging\". Moreover, references of the selected articles were browsed and searched for additional pertinent articles. We believe this work will supply the robust references for clinicians to further understand the different WML patterns of varying vascular etiologies and thus make customized treatment.",

    "abstract": "Owing to the global exponential increase in population ageing, there is an urgent unmet need to develop reliable strategies to slow down and delay the ageing process. Age-related neurodegenerative diseases are among the main causes of morbidity and mortality in our contemporary society and represent a major socio-economic burden. There are several controversial factors that are thought to play a causal role in brain ageing which are continuously being examined in experimental models. Among them are oxidative stress and brain inflammation which are empirical to brain ageing. Although some candidate drugs have been developed which reduce the ageing phenotype, their clinical translation is limited. There are several strategies currently in development to improve brain ageing. These include strategies such as caloric restriction, ketogenic diet, promotion of cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) levels, removal of senescent cells, ‘young blood’ transfusions, enhancement of adult neurogenesis, stem cell therapy, vascular risk reduction, and non-pharmacological lifestyle strategies. Several studies have shown that these strategies can not only improve brain ageing by attenuating age-related neurodegenerative disease mechanisms, but also maintain cognitive function in a variety of pre-clinical experimental murine models. However, clinical evidence is limited and many of these strategies are awaiting findings from large-scale clinical trials which are nascent in the current literature. Further studies are needed to determine their long-term efficacy and lack of adverse effects in various tissues and organs to gain a greater understanding of their potential beneficial effects on brain ageing and health span in humans.",

Currently, the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease, is still not fully understood. Remarkably, emerging evidence indicates a role of genomic DNA damage and repair in various neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we summarized the current understanding of the function of DNA damage repair, especially base excision repair and double strand break repair pathways, in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. We concluded that exacerbation of DNA lesions is found in almost all types of neurodegenerative diseases, whereas the activities of different DNA repair pathways demonstrate distinct trends, depending on disease type and even brain region. Specifically, key enzymes involved in base excision repair are likely impaired in Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis but activated in Parkinson's disease, while nonhomologous end joining is likely downregulated in most types of neurodegenerative diseases. Hence, impairment of nonhomologous end joining is likely a common etiology for most neurodegenerative diseases, while defects in base excision repair are likely involved in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis but are Parkinson's disease, based on current findings. Although there are still discrepancies and further studies are required to completely elucidate the exact roles of DNA repair in neurodegeneration, the current studies summarized here provide crucial insights into the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases and may reveal novel drug targets for corresponding neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Glia cells are essential for brain functioning during development, aging and disease. However, the role of astroglia plays during brain development is quite different from the role played in the adult lesioned brain. Therefore, a deeper understanding of pathomechanisms underlying astroglia activity in the aging brain and cerebrovascular diseases is essential to guide the development of new therapeutic strategies. To this end, this review provides a comparison between the transcriptomic activity of astroglia cells during development, aging and neurodegenerative diseases, including cerebral ischemia. During fetal brain development, astrocytes and microglia often affect the same developmental processes such as neuro-/gliogenesis, angiogenesis, axonal outgrowth, synaptogenesis, and synaptic pruning. In the adult brain astrocytes are a critical player in the synapse remodeling by mediating synapse elimination while microglia activity has been associated with changes in synaptic plasticity and remove cell debris by constantly sensing the environment. However, in the lesioned brain astrocytes proliferate and play essential functions with regard to energy supply to the neurons, neurotransmission and buildup of a protective scar isolating the lesion site from the surroundings. Inflammation, neurodegeneration, or loss of brain homeostasis induce changes in microglia gene expression, morphology, and function, generally referred to as \"primed\" microglia. These changes in gene expression are characterized by an enrichment of phagosome, lysosome, and antigen presentation signaling pathways and is associated with an up-regulation of genes encoding cell surface receptors. In addition, primed microglia are characterized by upregulation of a network of genes in response to interferon gamma. <i>Conclusion</i>. A comparison of astroglia cells transcriptomic activity during brain development, aging and neurodegenerative disorders might provide us with new therapeutic strategies with which to protect the aging brain and improve clinical outcome.",

    "abstract": "Published observational studies have revealed the connection between neurodegenerative disorders and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), whereas the causal association remains largely unclear. Our study aims to assess the causality and identify the shared genetic architecture between neurodegenerative disorders and IBD. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses were performed to assess the causality between IBD and neurodegenerative disorders (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS], Alzheimer's disease [AD], Parkinson's disease [PD], and multiple sclerosis [MS]). Shared genetic loci, functional interpretation, and transcriptomic profiles were further investigated in ALS and IBD. We identified that genetic predisposition to IBD was suggestively associated with lower odds of ALS (odds ratio [OR] 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94 to 0.99). In contrast, IBD was not genetically associated with an increased risk of AD, PD, or MS (and vice versa). Two shared genetic loci (rs6571361 and rs7154847) were derived, and SCFD1, G2E3, and HEATR5A were further identified as novel risk genes with enriched functions related to membrane trafficking. G2E3 was differentially expressed and significantly correlated with SCFD1 in patients with ALS or IBD. Our study reveals the suggestively protective role of IBD on ALS, and does not support the causality of AD, PD, or MS on IBD (and vice versa). Our findings indicate possible shared genetic architecture and pathways between ALS and IBD. These results provide insights into the pathogenesis and therapeutics of IBD and neurodegenerative disorders.",

Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, are critically involved in neuroinflammatory regulation and neural survival. Modulating microglial activation is thus a promising approach to alleviate neuronal injury. Our serial studies have revealed a neuroprotective role of the δ-opioid receptor (DOR) in several acute and chronic cerebral injuries by regulating neuroinflammation and cellular oxidative stress. More recently, we found an endogenous mechanism for the inhibition of neuroinflammation is closely related to DOR's modulation of microglia. Our recent studies showed that DOR activation could strongly protect neurons from hypoxia- and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced injury by inhibiting microglial pro-inflammatory transformation, while knocking-down DOR or restraining DOR activity promoted microglia activation and the relevant inflammatory events with an aggravation of cell injury. This novel finding highlights a therapeutic potential of DOR in numerous age-related neurological disorders through the modulation of neuroinflammation by targeting microglia. This review summarized the current data regarding the role of microglia in neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and age-related neurological diseases focusing on the pharmacological effects and signaling transduction of DOR in microglia.",

However, the detailed mechanisms and the potential translational value of S1PR modulators for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) therapy warrant exploration. Using collagenase VII-S-induced ICH in the left striatum of mice, we investigated the effects of siponimod on cellular and molecular immunoinflammatory responses in the hemorrhagic brain in the presence or absence of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies (Abs). We also assessed the severity of short- and long-term brain injury and evaluated the efficacy of siponimod in long-term neurologic function. Siponimod treatment significantly decreased brain lesion volume and brain water content on day 3 and the volume of the residual lesion and brain atrophy on day 28. It also inhibited neuronal degeneration on day 3 and improved long-term neurologic function. These protective effects may be associated with a reduction in the expression of lymphotactin (XCL1) and T-helper 1 (Th1)-type cytokines (interleukin 1β and interferon-γ). It may also be associated with inhibition of neutrophil and lymphocyte infiltration and alleviation of T lymphocyte activation in perihematomal tissues on day 3. However, siponimod did not affect the infiltration of natural killer cells (NK) or the activation of CD3-negative immunocytes in perihematomal tissues. Furthermore, it did not influence the activation or proliferation of microglia or astrocytes around the hematoma on day 3. Siponimod appears to have a profound impact on infiltration and activation of T lymphocytes after ICH. The effects of neutralized anti-CD3 Abs-induced T-lymphocyte tolerance on siponimod immunomodulation further confirmed that siponimod alleviated the cellular and molecular Th1 response in the hemorrhagic brain. This study provides preclinical evidence that encourages future investigation of immunomodulators, including siponimod, which target the lymphocyte-related immunoinflammatory reaction in ICH therapy.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most severe complication of tuberculosis (TB) and is associated with high rates of disability and mortality. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb), the infectious agent of TB, disseminates from the respiratory epithelium, breaks through the blood-brain barrier, and establishes a primary infection in the meninges. Microglia are the core of the immune network in the central nervous system (CNS) and interact with glial cells and neurons to fight against harmful pathogens and maintain homeostasis in the brain through pleiotropic functions. However, M. tb directly infects microglia and resides in them as the primary host for bacillus infections. Largely, microglial activation slows disease progression. The non-productive inflammatory response that initiates the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines may be neurotoxic and aggravate tissue injuries based on damages caused by M. tb. Host-directed therapy (HDT) is an emerging strategy for modulating host immune responses against diverse diseases. Recent studies have shown that HDT can control neuroinflammation in TBM and act as an adjunct therapy to antibiotic treatment. In this review, we discuss the diverse roles of microglia in TBM and potential host-directed TB therapies that target microglia to treat TBM. We also discuss the limitations of applying each HDT and suggest a course of action for the near future.",

    "abstract": "A wealth of knowledge regarding glial cell-mediated neuroinflammation, which contributes to cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has emerged in recent years. Contactin 1(CNTN1), a member of the cell adhesion molecule and immunoglobulin supergene family, is centrally involved in axonal growth regulation and is also a key player in inflammation-associated disorders. However, whether CNTN1 plays a role in inflammation-related cognitive deficits and how this process is triggered and orchestrated remain to be fully elucidated. In this study, we examined postmortem brains with AD. CNTN1 immunoreactivity was markedly increased, particularly in the CA3 subregion, as compared with non-AD brains. Furthermore, by applying an adeno-associated virus-based approach to overexpress CNTN1 directly via stereotactic injection in mice, we demonstrated that hippocampal CNTN1 overexpression triggered cognitive deficits detected by novel object-recognition, novel place-recognition and social cognition tests. The mechanisms underlying these cognitive deficits could be attributed to hippocampal microglia and astrocyte activation, which led to aberrant expression of excitatory amino acid transporters (EAAT)1/EAAT2. This resulted in long-term potentiation (LTP) impairment that could be reversed by minocyline, an antibiotic and the best-known inhibitor of microglial activation. Taken together, our results identified Cntn1 as a susceptibility factor involved in regulating cognitive deficits via functional actions in the hippocampus. This factor correlated with microglial activation and triggered astrocyte activation with abnormal EAAT1/EAAT2 expression and LTP impairment. Overall, these findings may significantly advance our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the risk of neuroinflammation related cognitive deficits.",

    "abstract": "Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a serious neurological disease. Normobaric hyperoxia (NBHO) is both a non-invasive and easy method that seems to be able to improve outcomes after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. In clinical trials, normal low-flow oxygen has been shown to be ineffective, but NBHO has been shown to have a transient brain-protective effect. Today, NBHO combined with recanalization is the best treatment available. NBHO combined with thrombolysis is considered to improve neurological scores and long-term outcomes. Large randomized controlled trials (RCTs), however, are still needed to determine the role they will have in stroke treatment. RCTs of NBHO combined with thrombectomy have both improved infarct volume at 24 hours and the long-term prognosis. These two mechanisms most likely play key roles in the neuroprotective actions of NBHO after recanalization, including the increase in penumbra oxygen supply and the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Considering the mechanism of action of NBHO, oxygen should be given as early as possible to increase the duration of oxygen therapy before recanalization is initiated. NBHO can further prolong the existence time of penumbra, so that more patients may benefit from it. Overall, however, recanalization therapy is still essential.",

    "abstract": "A cascade of pathological processes is triggered in the lesion area after ischemic stroke. Unfortunately, our understanding of these complicated molecular events is incomplete. In this investigation, we sought to better understand the detailed molecular and inflammatory events occurring after ischemic stroke. RNA-seq technology was used to identify whole gene expression profiles at days (D1, D3, D7, D14, D21) after focal cerebral ischemia in mice. Enrichment analyses based on Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) terms for the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were then analyzed. Inflammation-related genes that were significantly expressed after stroke were selected for analysis and the temporal expression patterns of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes were reported. These data illustrated that the number of DEGs increased accumulatively after cerebral ischemia. In summary, there were 1967 DEGs at D1, 2280 DEGs at D3, 2631 DEGs at D7, 5516 DEGs at D14 and 7093 DEGs at D21. The significantly enriched GO terms also increased. 58 GO terms and 18 KEGG pathways were significantly enriched at all inspected time points. We identified 87 DEGs which were functionally related to inflammatory responses. The expression levels of pro-inflammation related genes CD16, CD32, CD86, CD11b, Tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α), Interleukin 1β (IL-1β) increased over time and peaked at D14. Anti-inflammation related genes Arginase 1 (Arg1) and Chitinase-like 3 (Ym1) peaked at D1 while IL-10, Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and CD206, which were induced at 1 day after cerebral ischemia, peaked by 7 to 14 days. These gene profile changes were potentially linked to microglia/macrophage phenotype changes and could play a role in astroglial activation. This study supplies new insights and detailed information on the molecular events and pathological mechanisms that occur after experimental ischemic stroke.",

It has been demonstrated that several effective compounds of GF, such as geniposide, genipin and crocin, have neuroprotective or related activities which are involved in senile disease treatment. These bioactivities include the mitochondrion dysfunction, antioxidative activity, apoptosis regulation and an anti-inflammatory activity, which related to multiple signaling pathways such as the nuclear factor-κB pathway, AMP-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.

This review focuses on the immunogenicity, safety, efficacy and effectiveness data on the use of the 13-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13) in adults. A MEDLINE literature search was performed from January 1946 to December 2017. Additional references were identified from a review of literature citations. All English-language randomized trials, observational studies and meta-analyses assessing the immunogenicity, efficacy, effectiveness and safety of PCV13 in adults were evaluated. Six randomized controlled studies evaluated immunogenicity and safety of PCV13 in adults and showed that the conjugated vaccine elicited a greater immune response to the majority of the 13 serotypes compared to the 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine (PPV23). Administering PCV13 prior to PPV23 elicits greater immune responses and multiple doses of PCV13 demonstrated modest advantage. PCV13 titers declined after a year but remained above baseline. A randomized clinical trial (CAPiTA) showed that PCV13 was effective in preventing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease, but not any cause pneumonia. Safety data shows PCV13 elicits minor local reactions, such as pain at the injection site. Major side effects that were commonly reported included muscle fatigue and headache. Both local and systemic adverse events were comparable to PPV23. While PCV13 has a well-established immunogenicity and safety profile in adults, there is sparse data on sequential or multiple dosing, efficacy and effectiveness in adults. As there are few countries who have adopted PCV13 for routine adult immunization, there is a need to evaluate the effectiveness of PCV13 in a real-world setting.",

    "abstract": "A promising strategy for the prevention of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the identification of age-related changes that place the brain at risk for the disease. Additionally, AD is associated with chronic dehydration, and one of the significant changes that are known to result in metabolic dysfunction is an increase in the endogenous formaldehyde (FA) level. Here, we demonstrate that the levels of uric formaldehyde in AD patients were markedly increased compared with normal controls. The brain formaldehyde levels of wild-type C57 BL/6 mice increased with age, and these increases were followed by decreases in their drinking frequency and water intake. The serum arginine vasopressin (AVP) concentrations were also maintained at a high level in the 10-month-old mice. An intravenous injection of AVP into the tail induced decreases in the drinking frequency and water intake in the mice, and these decreases were associated with increases in brain formaldehyde levels. An ELISA assay revealed that the AVP injection increased both the protein level and the enzymatic activity of semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO), which is an enzyme that produces formaldehyde. In contrast, the intraperitoneal injection of formaldehyde increased the serum AVP level by increasing the angiotensin II (ANG II) level, and this change was associated with a marked decrease in water intake behavior. These data suggest that the interaction between formaldehyde and AVP affects the water intake behaviors of mice. Furthermore, the highest concentration of formaldehyde in vivo was observed in the morning. Regular water intake is conducive to eliminating endogenous formaldehyde from the human body, particularly when water is consumed in the morning. Establishing good water intake habits not only effectively eliminates excess formaldehyde and other metabolic products but is also expected to yield valuable approaches to reducing the risk of AD prior to the onset of the disease.",

By specific knock down of the Kif4a using morpholino microinjection, we found that the disruption of Kif4a caused the failure of polar body extrusion. Further analysis indicated that Kif4a might affect the spindle morphology and chromosome alignment in the mouse oocytes, and this might be due to the regulation of tubulin acetylation. Moreover, our results showed that an increased proportion of aneuploidy in the Kif4a knock down oocytes, and this might be due to the loss of kinetochore-microtubule attachment.

Here, our study shows that APS could significantly extend adult stage, mean, and maximum lifespan of the silkworm, <i>Bombyx mori</i> and increase body weight without affecting food intake and fecundity. Meanwhile, the activities of glutathione S-transferase and superoxide dismutase are significantly enhanced, and the reaction oxygen species content is reduced concomitantly. Moreover, the activity of lysozyme is increased dramatically. In addition, APS rescues the shortened lifespan by <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> infection in silkworm. Furthermore, the transcription of the crucial genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress is upregulated upon the endoplasmic reticulum stress stimulation. APS also significantly ameliorates endoplasmic reticulum stress in silkworm cell line and in vivo. Together, the results of this study indicate that APS can prolong the silkworm lifespan by mitigating endoplasmic reticulum stress. This study improves our understanding of the molecular mechanism of APS-induced lifespan extension and highlights the importance of the silkworm as an experimental animal for evaluating the effects and revealing the mechanisms in lifespan extension of traditional Chinese medicine.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades, the increase in human longevity has made it increasingly important to expand our knowledge on aging.To accomplish this, the use of animal models is essential, with the most common being mouse (phylogenetically similar to humans, and a model with a long life expectancy) and Caenorhabditis elegans (an invertebrate with a short life span, but quite removed from us in evolutionary terms).However, some sort of model is needed to bridge the differences between those mentioned above, achieving a balance between phylogenetic distance and life span.Fish of the genus Nothobranchius were suggested 10 years ago as a possible alternative for the study of the aging process.In the meantime, numerous studies have been conducted at different levels: behavioral (including the study of the rest-activity rhythm), populational, histochemical, biochemical and genetic, among others, with very positive results.This review compiles what we know about Nothobranchius to date, and examines its future prospects as a true alternative to the classic models for studies on aging.",

    "abstract": "Influence of physiotherapy on the outcome of the lung resection is still controversial. Study aim was to assess the influence of physiotherapy program on postoperative lung function and effort tolerance in lung cancer patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that are undergoing lobectomy or pneumonectomy. The prospective study included 56 COPD patients who underwent lung resection for primary non small-cell lung cancer after previous physiotherapy (Group A) and 47 COPD patients (Group B) without physiotherapy before lung cancer surgery. In Group A, lung function and effort tolerance on admission were compared with the same parameters after preoperative physiotherapy. Both groups were compared in relation to lung function, effort tolerance and symptoms change after resection. In patients with tumors requiring a lobectomy, after preoperative physiotherapy, a highly significant increase in FEV<sub>1</sub>, VC, FEF<sub>50</sub> and FEF<sub>25</sub> of 20%, 17%, 18% and 16% respectively was registered with respect to baseline values. After physiotherapy, a significant improvement in 6-minute walking distance was achieved. After lung resection, the significant loss of FEV<sub>1</sub> and VC occurred, together with significant worsening of the small airways function, effort tolerance and symptomatic status. After the surgery, a clear tendency existed towards smaller FEV<sub>1</sub> loss in patients with moderate to severe, when compared to patients with mild baseline lung function impairment. A better FEV<sub>1</sub> improvement was associated with more significant loss in FEV<sub>1</sub>. Physiotherapy represents an important part of preoperative and postoperative treatment in COPD patients undergoing a lung resection for primary lung cancer.",

We also review the central role of the sirtuin family of proteins in physiological modulation of cellular processes and age-associated metabolic diseases. We also provide a macroscopic view of how the circadian rhythm affects metabolism and may be involved in cell metabolism reprogramming and cancer pathogenesis. The aberrations in metabolism and the circadian system may lead to age-associated diseases directly or through intermediates. These intermediates may be either mutated or reprogrammed, thus becoming responsible for chromatin modification and oncogene transcription. Integration of circadian rhythm and metabolic reprogramming in the holistic understanding of metabolic diseases and cancer may provide additional insights into human diseases.",

    "abstract": "Chronic remote ischemic conditioning (RIC), particularly long-term repeated RIC, has been applied in clinical trials with the expectation that it could play its protective roles for protracted periods. In sports medicine, chronic RIC has also been demonstrated to improve exercise performance, akin to improvements seen with regular exercise training. Therefore, chronic RIC may mimic regular exercise, and they may have similar underlying mechanisms. In this study, we explored the common underlying mechanisms of chronic RIC and physical exercise in protecting multiple organs and benefiting various populations, the advantages of chronic RIC, and the challenges for its popularization. Intriguingly, several underlying mechanisms of RIC and exercise have been shown to overlap. These include the production of many autacoids, enhanced ability for antioxidant activity, modulating immune and inflammatory responses. Therefore, it appears that chronic RIC, just like regular exercise, has beneficial effects in unhealthy, sub-healthy and healthy individuals. Compared with regular exercise, chronic RIC has several advantages, which may provide novel insights into the area of exercise and health. Chronic RIC may enrich the modes of exercise, and benefit individuals with severe diseases. Also, the disabled, and sub-healthy individuals are likely to benefit from chronic RIC either as an alternative to exercise or an adjunct to pharmacological or non-pharmacological therapy.",

    "abstract": "Acute ischemic stroke continues to be a very severe disorder that has significant impact on human health. Its treatment options are limited and alteplase remains the only American Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for patients with acute ischemic stroke. Furthermore, intravenous thrombolysis remains substantially underutilized, because it has rigorous indications and contraindications. Most patients simply do not meet these criteria and cannot receive thrombolytic treatment. Guidelines in many countries currently include a history of stroke within months as one of the exclusion criteria for intravenous thrombolysis. Although this is based on previous data, it lacks strong evidentiary support. Several recent studies suggested that intravenous thrombolysis may be beneficial for this patient population. We reviewed relevant publications of intravenous thrombolysis or repeated intravenous thrombolysis in patients with a history of stroke in the past 3 months. We found that intravenous thrombolysis in these patients is not as hazardous as previously believed. Among patients with relatively small infarctions and a good prognosis, intravenous thrombolysis may be a good treatment option. We hope that more research will be carried out on this topic to reexamine the criteria for intravenous thrombolysis to allow more patients to benefit from treatment.",

Out of the many pharmacological effects of Dimebon, improvement of impaired mitochondrial function seeems to be most relevant for the substantial effects on cognition and behaviour reported in one of the studies, as these effects are already present at the low concentrations of dimebon measured in plasma and tissues of patients and experimental animals. Since impaired mitochondrial function seems to be the major driving force for the progression of the clinical symptoms and since most of the clinical benefits of dimebon originate from an effect on the symptomatic deterioration, mitochondrial improvement can also explain the lack of efficacy of this drug in another clinical trial where symptoms of the patiets remained stable for the time of the study. Accordingly, it seems worthwhile to reevaluate the clinical data to proof that clinical response is correlated with high levels of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms as these show a good relationship to the individual speed of symptomatic decline in AD patients related to mitochondrial dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is well-known to exert complications such as retinopathy, cardiomyopathy and neuropathy. However, in recent years, an elevated osteoarthritis (OA) complaints among diabetics have been observed, portending the risk of diabetic OA. Since formation of advanced glycation end products (AGE) is believed to be the etiology of various diseases under hyperglycemic conditions, we firstly established that streptozotocin-induced DM could potentiate the development of OA in C57BL/6J mouse model, and further explored the intra-articularly administered adipose-derived stem cell (ADSC) therapy focusing on underlying AGE-associated mechanism. Our results demonstrated that hyperglycemic mice exhibited OA-like structural impairments including a proteoglycan loss and articular cartilage fibrillations in knee joint. Highly expressed levels of carboxymethyl lysine (CML), an AGE and their receptors (RAGE), which are hallmarks of hyperglycemic microenvironment were manifested. The elevated oxidative stress in diabetic OA knee-joint was revealed through increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA). Further, oxidative stress-activated nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), the marker of proinflammatory signalling pathway was also accrued; and levels of matrix metalloproteinase-1 and 13 were upregulated. However, ADSC treatment attenuated all OA-like changes by 4 weeks, and dampened levels of CML, RAGE, MDA, NF-κB, MMP-1 and 13. These results suggest that during repair and regeneration, ADSCs inhibited glycation-mediated inflammatory cascade and rejuvenated cartilaginous tissue, thereby promoting knee-joint integrity in diabetic milieu.",

    "abstract": "Although aging is a physiological process, it has raised interest in the science of aging and rejuvenation because of the increasing burden on the rapidly aging global population. With advanced age, there is a decline in homeostatic maintenance and regenerative responsiveness to the injury of various tissues, thereby contributing to the incidence of age-related diseases. The primary cause of the functional declines that occur along with aging is considered to be the exhaustion of stem cell functions in their corresponding tissues. Age-related changes in the systemic environment, the niche, and stem cells contribute to this loss. Thus, the reversal of stem cell aging at the cellular level might lead to the rejuvenation of the animal at an organismic level and the prevention of aging, which would be critical for developing new therapies for age-related dysfunction and diseases. Here, we will explore the effects of aging on stem cells in different tissues. The focus of this discussion is on pro-youth interventions that target intrinsic stem cell properties, environmental niche component, systemic factors, and senescent cellular clearance, which are promising for developing strategies related to the reversal of aged stem cell function and optimizing tissue repair processes.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in neuroimaging have demonstrated that patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) may retain residual consciousness through activation of a complex functional brain network. However, an understanding of the hierarchy of residual consciousness and dynamic network connectivity in DOC patients is lacking. This study aimed to investigate residual consciousness and the dynamics of neural processing in DOC patients. We included 42 patients with DOC, categorized by aetiology. Event-related potentials combined with time-varying electroencephalography networks were used to probe affective consciousness in DOC and examine the related network mechanisms. The results showed an obvious frontal P3a component among patients in minimally conscious state (MCS), while a prominent N1 was observed in unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS). No late positive potential (LPP) was detected in these patients. Next, we divided the results by aetiology. Patients with nontraumatic injury presented an obvious frontal P3a response compared to those with traumatic injury. With respect to the dynamic network mechanism, patients with UWS, both with and without trauma, exhibited impaired frontoparietal network connectivity during the middle to late emotion processing period (P3a and LPP). Surprisingly, unconscious post-traumatic patients had an evident deficit in top-down connectivity. This, it appears that early automatic sensory identification is preserved in UWS and that exogenous attention was preserved even in MCS. However, high-level cognitive abilities were severely attenuated in unconscious patients. We also speculate that reduced frontoparietal connectivity may be useful as a biomarker to distinguish patients in an MCS from those with UWS given the same aetiology.",

The National Library of Medicine (PubMed) was searched on March 23, 2015 with no limits on publication dates. One reviewer selected original research studies of older adults (>= 65 years) that assessed the relationship between lower-extremity peripheral nerve function and mobility-related outcomes. Participants, study design and methods of assessing peripheral nerve impairment were evaluated and results were reported and synthesized. Eight articles were identified, including 6 cross-sectional and 2 longitudinal studies. These articles investigated 6 elderly cohorts (4 from the U.S. and 2 from Italy): 3 community-dwelling (including 1 with only disabled women and 1 without mobility limitations at baseline), 1 with both community-dwelling and institutionalized residents, 1 from a range of residential locations, and 1 of patients with peripheral arterial disease. Mean ages ranged from 71-82 years. Nerve function was assessed by vibration threshold (n=2); sensory measures and clinical signs and symptoms of neuropathy (n=2); motor nerve conduction (n=1); and a combination of both sensory measures and motor nerve conduction (n=3). Each study found that worse peripheral nerve function was related to poor mobility, although relationships varied based on the nerve function measure and mobility domain assessed. Six studies found that the association between nerve function and mobility persisted despite adjustment for diabetes. Evidence suggests that peripheral nerve function impairment at various levels of severity is related to poor mobility independent of diabetes. Relationships varied depending on peripheral nerve measure, which may be particularly important when investigating specific biological mechanisms. Future research needs to identify risk factors for peripheral nerve decline beyond diabetes, especially those common in late-life and modifiable. Interventions to preserve nerve function should be investigated with regard to their effect on postponing or preventing disability in older adults.",

We investigated the potential utility of serum occludin, a BBB damage biomarker, in predicting the severity of AIS, hemorrhagic transformation (HT) and patient prognosis. A total of 243 patients, suspected of suffering an AIS and admitted to the emergency room at Xuanwu Hospital between November 2018 to March 2019, were enrolled in this study. Serum occludin levels were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and clinical data were collected from each patient. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) were used to analyze the relationship between serum occludin and AIS. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between serum occludin and stroke prognosis. Serum occludin levels were significantly elevated in acute stroke cases compared with those with stroke-like symptoms (P<0.001). In the moderate and severe cerebral infarction (CI) groups, serum occludin levels were significantly higher than those in the mild CI group (P<0.001). Patients with HT had higher occludin levels than non-HT patients (P<0.05). In addition, serum occludin level of patients with poor prognosis was significantly higher than that of the patients with good prognosis for non-reperfusion therapy. The ROC curve showed that serum occludin could reasonably predict HT and poor prognosis. Moreover, serum occludin were independently associated with 90-day poor prognosis. These findings suggest that the serum occludin levels could be used to identify early acute stroke cases and may predict the severity of AIS and HT as well as the prognosis at 90 days.",

Herein, we reported that Oxyphylla A, a novel lead compound from the fruit of Alpinia oxyphylla, significantly promoted α-syn degradation in a cellular PD model. When exploring the molecular pathways, we found that Oxyphylla A promoted α-syn degradation in a ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS)-dependent and autophagy-independent manner. We further confirmed that Oxyphylla A enhanced UPS activity by upregulating 20S subunit PSMB8 expression. A mechanism study revealed that Oxyphylla A activated the PKA/Akt/mTOR pathway to trigger PSMB8 expression and enhance UPS activity. Finally, we illustrated that Oxyphylla A alleviated the accumulation of both Triton-soluble and Triton-insoluble forms of α-syn and protected against α-syn-induced neurotoxicity in A53T α-syn transgenic mice. These findings suggest that the activation of UPS, via small molecular UPS enhancers including Oxyphylla A, may be a therapeutic strategy for intervention against PD and related diseases.",

    "abstract": "In this second return of the pandemic, January 2021, it appears to be clear that a Nano-sized organism, the SARS-CoV-2, has rendered the human race helpless, made the global health status decline, and drowned the world economy. However, it does not appear clear the real origin of the SARS-CoV-2 and the aim of this work is to report and discuss, maybe for the first time since the pandemic began, the scientific data published in this specific field, analyzing the potentially available weapons against the SARS-CoV-2. About this last point, a ray of hope comes from the potential of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) that has already been established in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and in particular from the Adipose-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (AD-MSCs). However, cell-based therapy has its own limits, especially represented by the know-how in this field and by the rules of applications. It was suggested a biological therapy using AD-MSCs as a weapon against COVID-19, as they can be a game-changer owing to their immuno-modulatory nature, which combats the cytokine storm characterizing this disease, and their practical efficiency, which will realistically aid large access to therapy worldwide.",

    "abstract": "In the last decades, the strong increase in the proportion of older people worldwide, and the increased prevalence of age associated degenerative diseases, have put a stronger focus on aging biology.In spite of important progresses in our understanding of the aging process, an integrative view is still lacking and there is still need for efficient anti-aging interventions that could improve healthspan, reduce incidence of age-related disease and, eventually, increase the lifespan.Interestingly, some compounds from traditional medicine have been found to possess anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, suggesting that they could play a role as antiaging compounds, although in depth in vivo investigations are still scarce.In this study we used one the major aging model organisms, Drosophila melanogaster, to investigate the ability of four herb extracts (HEs: Dendrobium candidum, Ophiopogon japonicum, Ganoderma sinense and Panax notoginseng) widely used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to slow down aging and improve healthspan of aged animals.Combining multiple approaches (stress resistance assays, lifespan and metabolic measurements, functional heart characterizations and behavioral assays), we show that these four HEs provide in vivo protection from various insults, albeit with significant compound-specific differences.Importantly, extracts of P. notoginseng and G. sinense increase the healthspan of aging animals, as shown by increased activity during aging and improved heart function.In addition, these two compounds also provide protection in a Drosophila model of Huntington's disease (HD), suggesting that, besides their anti-aging properties in normal individuals, they could be also efficient in the protection against age-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "FoxOs and their post-translational modification by phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation can affect epigenetic modifications and promote the expression of downstream target genes.Therefore, they ultimately affect cellular and biological functions during aging or occurrence of age-related diseases including cancer, diabetes, and kidney diseases.As known for its key role in aging, FoxOs play various biological roles in the aging process by regulating reactive oxygen species, lipid accumulation, and inflammation.FoxOs regulated by PI3K/Akt pathway modulate the expression of various target genes encoding MnSOD, catalases, PPARγ, and IL-1β during aging, which are associated with age-related diseases.This review highlights the age-dependent differential regulatory mechanism of Akt/FoxOs axis in metabolic and non-metabolic organs.We demonstrated that age-dependent suppression of Akt increases the activity of FoxOs (Akt/FoxOs axis upregulation) in metabolic organs such as liver and muscle.This Akt/FoxOs axis could be modulated and reversed by antiaging paradigm calorie restriction (CR).In contrast, hyperinsulinemia-mediated PI3K/Akt activation inhibited FoxOs activity (Akt/FoxOs axis downregulation) leading to decrease of antioxidant genes expression in non-metabolic organs such as kidneys and lungs during aging.These phenomena are reversed by CR.The results of studies on the process of aging and CR indicate that the Akt/FoxOs axis plays a critical role in regulating metabolic homeostasis, redox stress, and inflammation in various organs during aging process.The benefical actions of CR on the Akt/FoxOs axis in metabolic and non-metabolic organs provide further insights into the molecular mechanisms of organ-differential roles of Akt/FoxOs axis during aging.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 is prevalent in the elderly. Old individuals are more likely to develop pneumonia and respiratory failure due to alveolar damage, suggesting that lung senescence may increase the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. Considering that human coronavirus (HCoVs; SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV) require host cellular factors for infection and replication, we analyzed Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data to test whether lung aging is associated with transcriptional changes in human protein-coding genes that potentially interact with these viruses. We found decreased expression of the gene tribbles homolog 3 (<i>TRIB3</i>) during aging in male individuals, and its protein was predicted to interact with HCoVs nucleocapsid protein and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Using publicly available lung single-cell data, we found <i>TRIB3</i> expressed mainly in alveolar epithelial cells that express SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. Functional enrichment analysis of age-related genes, in common with SARS-CoV-induced perturbations, revealed genes associated with the mitotic cell cycle and surfactant metabolism. Given that TRIB3 was previously reported to decrease virus infection and replication, the decreased expression of <i>TRIB3</i> in aged lungs may help explain why older male patients are related to more severe cases of the COVID-19. Thus, drugs that stimulate TRIB3 expression should be evaluated as a potential therapy for the disease.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan in December 2019 and soon became a worldwide pandemic. We collected and analyzed the data from 1077 patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the west campus of Wuhan Union Hospital from January 16 to April 16, 2020. Sixty (5.6%) of the 1077 COVID-19 patients were diagnosed with acute kidney injury (AKI) during hospitalization, and 18 of them (30%) had AKI on chronic kidney disease (AKI/CKD). COVID-19 patients with AKI had a worse prognosis, with higher intensive care unit (ICU) admission (28.3%) and fatality (65%) rates than patients without AKI (3.4% and 10.7%, respectively). Among the COVID-19 patients, AKI was more likely to occur in male patients, the elderly, patients with more severe disease states and those with comorbidities (such as hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease (CHD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and CKD). COVID-19 patients with AKI were more likely to develop respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, acute liver injury, acute myocardial injury, heart failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cerebrovascular accident, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) than those without AKI. Compared with patients without AKI, COVID-19 patients with AKI had lower platelet counts, lymphocyte counts, albumin levels and serum calcium levels but had elevated leukocyte counts, neutrophil counts and serum potassium levels. Inflammatory indicators, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and procalcitonin (PCT), were significantly higher in patients with AKI than in those without AKI. COVID-19 patients with AKI also exhibited a longer prothrombin time (PT), a longer activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and a higher D-dimer level than those without AKI. Survival analysis revealed that COVID-19 patients with AKI had a reduced survival rate compared with those without AKI. Furthermore, COVID-19 patients with AKI/CKD had a lower survival rate than those with AKI or CKD only. Multiple logistic regression indicated that the predictors of AKI in COVID-19 patients included complications, such as respiratory failure and acute myocardial injury, and higher creatinine and PCT levels during hospitalization.",

The underlying pathophysiology of ischemic stroke is highly complicated and correlates with various pathological processes, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress injury, altered cell apoptosis and autophagy, excitotoxicity, and acidosis. The current treatment for ischemic stroke is limited to thrombolytic therapy such as recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. However, tissue plasminogen activator is limited by a very narrow therapeutic time window (<4.5 hours), selective efficacy, and hemorrhagic complication. Hence, the development of novel therapies to prevent ischemic damage to the brain is urgent. Chinese herbal medicine has a long history in treating stroke and its sequela. In the past decades, extensive studies have focused on the neuroprotective effects of Huanglian Jie Du decoction (HLJDD), an ancient and classical Chinese herbal formula that can treat a wide spectrum of disorders including ischemic stroke. In this review, the current evidence of HLJDD and its bioactive components for ischemic stroke is comprehensively reviewed, and their potential application directions in ischemic stroke management are discussed.",

Increasing evidence suggests that OA is a whole-joint disease involving cartilage degradation, synovitis, meniscal lesions, and subchondral bone remodeling. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is the accumulation of misfolded/unfolded proteins in the ER. Recent studies have found that ER stress is involved in the OA pathological changes by influencing the physiological function and survival of chondrocytes, fibroblast-like synoviocytes, synovial macrophages, meniscus cells, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, osteocytes, and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. Therefore, ER stress is an attractive and promising target for OA. However, although targeting ER stress has been proven to alleviate OA progression in vitro and in vivo, the treatments for OA remain in preclinical stage and require further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), carriers of nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins, are known to play significant roles in neurodegenerative pathogenesis. Studies have shown that EVs from AD human brain tissue contain toxic proteins that may lead to neuron cell damage and loss. However, the potential contribution of EV long RNAs (exLR) to AD pathobiology is less well known, and their biochemical functions and molecular properties remain obscure. Here, EVs were isolated from the frontal cortex of normal control (NC; N = 10) and AD (N = 8) brain tissue donors. We performed exLR profiling on the isolated EVs followed by pathway analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). A total of 1012 mRNAs, 320 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and 119 circular RNAs (circRNAs) were found to be differentially expressed (DE) in AD-EVs compared with NC-EVs. Functional analysis of the DEmRNAs revealed that metal ion transport, calcium signaling, and various neuronal processes were enriched. To investigate the possible functions of the identified DElncRNAs and DEcircRNAs, competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks were constructed and subjected to WGCNA, in which two gene modules were identified to be significantly correlated with AD. Moreover, we discovered that NC-EVs were more effective than AD-EVs in promoting cytokine expression, phagocytosis, and induction of calcium signaling in microglia. Our study provides an in-depth characterization of brain tissue exLR and identifies several RNAs that correlate with the pathogenesis of AD.",

    "abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and highly lethal inflammatory interstitial lung disease characterized by aberrant extracellular matrix deposition. Macrophage activation by cytokines released from repetitively injured alveolar epithelial cells regulates the inflammatory response, tissue remodeling, and fibrosis throughout various phases of IPF. Our previous studies demonstrate that nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic member 3 (NFATc3) regulates a wide array of macrophage genes during acute lung injury pathogenesis. However, the role of NFATc3 in IPF pathophysiology has not been previously reported. In the current study, we demonstrate that expression of NFATc3 is elevated in lung tissues and pulmonary macrophages in mice subjected to bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis and IPF patients. Remarkably, NFATc3 deficiency (NFATc3<sup>+/-</sup>) was protective in bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung injury and fibrosis. Adoptive transfer of NFATc3<sup>+/+</sup> macrophages to NFATc3<sup>+/-</sup> mice restored susceptibility to BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Furthermore, in vitro treatment with IL-33 or conditioned medium from BLM-treated epithelial cells increased production of CCL2 and CXCL2 in macrophages from NFATc3<sup>+/+</sup> but not NFATc3<sup>+/-</sup> mice. CXCL2 promoter-pGL3 Luciferase reporter vector showed accentuated reporter activity when co-transfected with the NFATc3 expression vector. More importantly, exogenous administration of recombinant CXCL2 into NFATc3<sup>+/-</sup> mice increased fibrotic markers and exacerbated IPF phenotype in BLM treated mice. Collectively, our data demonstrate, for the first time, that NFATc3 regulates pulmonary fibrosis by regulating CCL2 and CXCL2 gene expression in macrophages.",

Once there are intravascular plaques or vascular occlusion, other organs and circulatory systems will not work properly.

The emergence of lasers and fiber optics promotes the development of intravascular imaging and treatment. Laser imaging techniques can obtain deep vascular images owing to light scattering and absorption properties. Moreover, photothermal and photomechanical effects of laser make it possible to treat vascular diseases accurately. In this review, we present the research progress and applications of laser techniques in intravascular imaging and treatment. Firstly, we introduce intravascular optical coherent tomography and intravascular photoacoustic imaging, which can obtain various information of plaques. Multimodal intravascular imaging techniques provide more information about intravascular plaques, which have an essential influence on intravascular imaging. Secondly, two laser techniques including laser angioplasty and endovenous laser ablation are discussed for the treatment of arterial and venous diseases, respectively. Finally, the outlook of laser techniques in blood vessels, as well as the integration of laser imaging and treatment are prospected in the section of discussions.",

We sought to understand senescence in AF and the extent to which it aggravates the AF process. Twenty-six AF patients undergoing open-heart surgery were included, and 12 patients with sinus rhythm served as controls. Another cohort included 120 consecutive persistent AF patients with valvular heart diseases. HL-1 atrial myocytes were tachypaced (TP) to simulate experimental AF. Compared with sinus rhythm, left atrial appendages (LAAs) with AF presented a significantly increased positive area of cellular senescence, with upregulated expression of p16, p21 and p53. Next, p21 mRNA was increased in patients with AF recurrence compared with that in patients without recurrence. In multivariate analysis, p21 (OR: 2.97; 95% CI: 1.65-5.34; P<0.001) was a significant independent predictor of AF early recurrence. Interestingly, TP induced HL-1 atrial myocyte senescence in vitro, accompanied by a marked increase in the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and altered the expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)-related proteins. Suppression of p21 by siRNA reduced TP induced cell senescence and IL-1β, IL-6 elevation, and partly changed SR-related proteins expression. Moreover, we show that the level of γH2AX, a marker of DNA damage, was higher in AF patients than in sinus rhythm controls. Similarly, an increase in γH2AX levels was observed following TP. AF underlies cardiomyocyte senescence and contributes to deleterious atrial remodeling during disease progression. This finding may help facilitate the search for new therapeutic approaches for antiaging therapy for AF.",

In the scenario of \"healthy or good aging\", especially during the COVID-19 era, the proper implementation of exercise as \"adjuvant\" or \"polypill\" to improve disease-related symptoms and comorbidities in the general population is a top priority. However, there is still a gap concerning studies analyzing influence of exercise training to immune system in older people. Therefore, the aim of this review is to provide a brief summary of well-established findings in exercise immunology and immunogerontology, but with a focus on the main exercise-induced mechanisms associated with aging of the immune system (immunosenescence). The scientific data strongly supports the notion that regular exercise as a low-cost and non-pharmacological treatment approach, when adjusted on an individual basis in elderly, induce multiple rejuvenating mechanisms: (1) affects the telomere-length dynamics (a \"telo-protective\" effect), (2) promote short- and long-term anti-inflammatory effects (via e.g., triggering the anti-inflammatory phenotype), 3) stimulates the adaptive immune system (e.g., helps to offset diminished adaptive responses) and in parallel inhibits the accelerated immunosenescence process, (4) increases post-vaccination immune responses, and (5) possibly extends both healthspan and lifespan.",

However, the specific effects of a high-salt diet on synapse and tau protein remain poorly understood. In this study, aged (15-month-old) C57BL/6 mice received a normal (0.5% NaCl) or high-salt (8% NaCl) diet for 3 months, and N2a cells were treated with normal culture medium or a NaCl medium (40 mM). Spatial learning and memory abilities were tested using the Morris water maze. The levels of metabolites and related enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were confirmed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, western blotting, and immunofluorescence. We also investigated synapse morphology and the phosphorylation of tau protein. Under the high-salt diet, mice displayed impaired learning and memory compared to mice fed the normal diet. Furthermore, excessive salt intake disturbed the TCA cycle in both animals and cells compared to the respective normal controls. High dietary salt reduced postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, impaired neurons, and caused synaptic loss in the mice. We also detected tau hyperphosphorylation at different sites (Thr205, Thr231, and Thr181) without increasing total tau levels in response to high salt treatment, both in vivo and in vitro. We concluded that elevated salt intake impairs the TCA cycle and induces tau hyperphosphorylation and synapse dysfunction during aging, which ultimately results in cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "The new term essential tremor (ET) plus was proposed in the 2018 tremor consensus criteria. The National Survey of Essential Tremor Plus in China, a large multicenter registry study, aimed to evaluate the clinical features of pure ET and ET plus and explore possible factors related to ET plus. All patients with ET underwent neurological examination and neuropsychological assessment at 17 clinical sites. The diagnosis was made according to the 2018 consensus criteria. Clinicodemographic characteristics were analyzed. A total of 1160 patients were included, including 546 patients with pure ET and 614 patients with ET plus. The proportion of females was significantly higher in the ET plus than that in the pure ET (P = 0.001). The age at onset (AAO) of pure ET showed a bimodal distribution, with peaks in the 2nd and 5th decades. However, the AAO of the ET plus group demonstrated a skewed distribution, with a single peak in the 6th decade. Female sex (OR=1.645, P<0.001), older age (OR=1.023, P<0.001), lower educational level (OR=0.934, P<0.001), head tremor (OR=1.457, P<0.001), and higher the Tremor Research Group Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale (TETRAS)-II scores (OR=1.134, P<0.001) were significantly associated with ET plus. Old age and female sex may contribute to ET plus development. Pure ET showed a bimodal distribution for AAO, whereas ET plus showed a unimodal distribution. It remains unclear whether pure ET and ET plus are merely different stages of a single disease or represent distinct disease entities.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) invades human cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 (ACE-2) using a spike protein and leads to Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 primarily causes a respiratory infection that can lead to severe systemic inflammation. It is also common for some patients to develop significant neurological and psychiatric symptoms. The spread of SARS-CoV-2 to the CNS likely occurs through several pathways. Once spread in the CNS, many acute symptoms emerge, and such infections could also transpire into severe neurological complications, including encephalitis or ischemic stroke. After recovery from the acute infection, a significant percentage of patients develop \"long COVID,\" a condition in which several symptoms of COVID-19 persist for prolonged periods. This review aims to discuss acute and chronic neurological problems after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The potential mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 enters the CNS and causes neuroinflammation, neuropathological changes observed in post-mortem brains of COVID-19 patients, and cognitive and mood problems in COVID-19 survivors are discussed in the initial part. The later part of the review deliberates the causes of long COVID, approaches for noninvasive tracking of neuroinflammation in long COVID patients, and the potential therapeutic strategies that could ease enduring CNS symptoms observed in long COVID.",

It is a significant health and financial burden for individuals, families, and society as a whole. The accumulation of damaged mitochondria in skeletal muscle contributes to the degeneration of muscles with age. Currently, the treatment of sarcopenia is limited to improving nutrition and physical activity. Studying effective methods to alleviate and treat sarcopenia to improve the quality of life and lifespan of older people is a growing area of interest in geriatric medicine. Therapies targeting mitochondria and restoring mitochondrial function are promising treatment strategies. This article provides an overview of stem cell transplantation for sarcopenia, including the mitochondrial delivery pathway and the protective role of stem cells. It also highlights recent advances in preclinical and clinical research on sarcopenia and presents a new treatment method involving stem cell-derived mitochondrial transplantation, outlining its advantages and challenges.",

    "abstract": "Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a cluster of cognitive problems that may arise after surgery. POCD symptoms include memory loss, focus inattention, and communication difficulties. Inflammasomes, intracellular multiprotein complexes that control inflammation, may have a significant role in the development of POCD. It has been postulated that the NLRP3 inflammasome promotes cognitive impairment by triggering the inflammatory response in the brain. Nevertheless, there are many gaps in the current literature to understand the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and develop future therapy. This review article underlines the limits of our current knowledge about the NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3) inflammasome and POCD. We first discuss inflammasomes and their types, structures, and functions, then summarize recent evidence of the NLRP3 inflammasome's involvement in POCD. Next, we propose a hypothesis that suggests the involvement of inflammasomes in multiple organs, including local surgical sites, blood circulation, and other peripheral organs, leading to systemic inflammation and subsequent neuronal dysfunction in the brain, resulting in POCD. Research directions are then discussed, including analyses of inflammasomes in more clinical POCD animal models and clinical trials, studies of inflammasome types that are involved in POCD, and investigations into whether inflammasomes occur at the surgical site, in circulating blood, and in peripheral organs. Finally, we discuss the potential benefits of using new technologies and approaches to study inflammasomes in POCD. A thorough investigation of inflammasomes in POCD might substantially affect clinical practice.",

In this minireview, we discuss data predominantly from the past three years, highlighting the pivotal roles and mechanisms of the two principal cell types implicated in neuroinflammation. The review also underscores the extended process of peripheral inflammation that predates symptomatic onset, the critical influence of neuroinflammation, and their dynamic interplay in the pathogenesis of NDDs. Confronting these complex challenges, we introduce compelling evidence supporting the use of mesenchymal stem cell-based cell-free therapy. This therapeutic strategy includes the regulation of microglia and astrocytes, modulation of peripheral nerve cell inflammation, and targeted anti-inflammatory interventions specifically designed for NDDs, while also discussing engineering and safety considerations. This innovative therapeutic approach intricately modulates the immune system across the peripheral and nervous systems, with an emphasis on achieving superior penetration and targeted delivery.

    "abstract": "It is well established that decreased brain blood flow, increased reactive oxygen species production (ROS), and pro-inflammatory mechanisms accelerate neurodegenerative disease progressions, including vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that our novel glycosylated Angiotensin-(1-7) Mas receptor agonist PNA5 reverses cognitive deficits, decreases ROS production, and inhibits inflammatory cytokine production in our preclinical mouse model of VCID that is induced by chronic heart failure (VCID-HF). In the present study, the effects of VCID-HF and treatment with PNA5 on microglia activation, blood-brain-barrier (BBB) integrity, and neurovascular coupling were assessed in our mouse model of VCID-HF. Three-month-old male C57BL/6J mice were subjected to myocardial infarction (MI) to induce heart failure for four weeks and then treated with subcutaneous injections of extended-release PNA5. Microglia activation, BBB permeability, cerebral perfusion, and neurovascular coupling were assessed. Results show that in our VCID-HF model, there was an increase in microglial activation and recruitment within the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus, a disruption in BBB integrity, and a decrease in neurovascular coupling. Treatment with PNA5 reversed these neuropathological effects of VCID-HF, suggesting that PNA5 may be an effective disease-modifying therapy to treat and prevent VCID. This study identifies potential mechanisms by which heart failure may induce VCID and highlights the possible mechanisms by which treatment with our novel glycosylated Angiotensin-(1-7) Mas receptor agonist, PNA5, may protect cognitive function in our model of VCID.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle dysfunction (SMD) is the most significant extrapulmonary complication and an independent prognostic indicator in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Myokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-15, myostatin, irisin, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, play important roles in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, protein synthesis and breakdown balance, and regeneration of skeletal muscles in COPD. As the main component of pulmonary rehabilitation, exercise can improve muscle strength, muscle endurance, and exercise capacity in patients with COPD, as well as improve the prognosis of SMD and COPD by regulating the expression levels of myokines. The mechanisms by which exercise regulates myokine levels are related to microRNAs. IGF-1 expression is upregulated by decreasing the expression of miR-1 or miR-29b. Myostatin downregulation and irisin upregulation are associated with increased miR-27a expression and decreased miR-696 expression, respectively. These findings suggest that myokines are potential targets for the prevention and treatment of SMD in COPD. A comprehensive analysis of the role and regulatory mechanisms of myokines can facilitate the development of new exercise-based therapeutic approaches for patients with COPD.",

The complexity of this condition is further highlighted by the impact of gene-environment interactions. A recent strategy combines advanced genomics and precision medicine methods to explore the complex genetic foundations of dementia. Utilizing the most recent research in the field of neurogenetics, the importance of precise genetic data in explaining the variation seen in dementia patients can be investigated. Gene-environment interactions are important because they influence genetic susceptibilities and aid in the development and progression of dementia. Modified to each patient's genetic profile, precision medicine has the potential to detect groups at risk and make previously unheard-of predictions about the course of diseases. Precision medicine techniques have the potential to completely transform treatment and diagnosis methods. Targeted medications that target genetic abnormalities will probably appear, providing the possibility for more efficient and customized medical interventions. Investigating the relationship between genes and the environment may lead to preventive measures that would enable people to change their surroundings and minimize the risk of dementia, leading to the improved lifestyle of affected people.

The isoforms Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase C (ALDOC) and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) have been proposed to play a role in AMD pathogenesis. While PKM2 and ALDOC are crucial for aerobic glycolysis in the neural retina, they are not as essential for the RPE. In this study, we examined the expression and activity of PKM2 and ALDOC in both young and aged RPE cells, as well as in the retina and RPE tissue of mice, including an experimentally induced AMD mouse model. Our findings reveal an upregulation in PKM2 and ALDOC expression, accompanied by increased pyruvate kinase activity, in the aged and AMD mouse RPE. Conversely, there is a decrease in ALDOC expression but an increase in PKM2 expression and pyruvate kinase activity in the aged and AMD retina. Overall, our study indicates that aged and AMD RPE cells tend to favor aerobic glycolysis, while this tendency is diminished in the aged and AMD retina. These results underscore the significance of targeting PKM2 and ALDOC in the RPE as a promising therapeutic approach to address the bioenergetic crisis and prevent vision loss in AMD.",

    "abstract": "Targeting adverse pathogenic gut microbiota regulation through fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) may restore health and has been validated in some aging-related diseases. However, the mechanisms of the gut microbiota's role in frailty and whether modulation of the gut microbiota can treat age-related frailty remain largely unknown. To assess the effects of FMT on frailty, we used bidirectional fecal microbiota transplantation in young and old mice. We demonstrated that fecal bacteria transplanted from old mice into young mice reduced body weight and grip strength (p=0.002), and led to elevated inflammatory factors in young mice, but had no significant effect on intestinal barrier function. Notably, FMT treatment in older mice not only improved frailty (grip strength: p=0.036, low physical activity: p=0.020, running speed: p=0.048, running time: p=0.058, frailty score: p=0.027) and muscle mass, but also improved intestinal ecological imbalances, intestinal barrier function, and systemic inflammation (serum TNF-α: p=0.002, and IL-6: p<0.001). KEGG enrichment analysis of fecal metabolites showed that FMT may ameliorate frailty through the sphingolipid metabolism pathway. In addition, aged mice given FMT treatment showed a significant increase in the abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria and increased levels of short-chain fatty acids (butyric acid: p=0.084, propionic acid: p=0.028). Subsequent further verification found that FMT ameliorating frailty may be achieved through SCFAs metabolism. Another mechanism study found that FMT reduces lipopolysaccharide levels (p<0.001), thereby inhibiting the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway and its downstream pro-inflammatory products. Therefore, regulating SCFAs metabolism by altering gut microbial composition and targeting the gut-muscle axis with LPS/TLR4 pathways may be potential strategies to treat frailty in older adults.",

    "abstract": "Fatigue, commonly experienced in daily life, is a feeling of extreme tiredness, shortage or lack of energy, exhaustion, and difficulty in performing voluntary tasks. Central fatigue, defined as a progressive failure to voluntarily activate the muscle, is typically linked to moderate- or light-intensity exercise. However, in some instances, high-intensity exercise can also trigger the onset of central fatigue. Exercise-induced central fatigue often precedes the decline in physical performance in well-trained athletes. This leads to a reduction in nerve impulses, decreased neuronal excitability, and an imbalance in brain homeostasis, all of which can adversely impact an athlete's performance and the longevity of their sports career. Therefore, implementing strategies to delay the onset of exercise-induced central fatigue is vital for enhancing athletic performance and safeguarding athletes from the debilitating effects of fatigue. In this review, we discuss the structural basis, measurement methods, and biomarkers of exercise-induced central fatigue. Furthermore, we propose non-pharmacological interventions to mitigate its effects, which can potentially foster improvements in athletes' performances in a healthful and sustainable manner.",

    "abstract": "Premature vascular aging and endothelial cell senescence are major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and atherothrombotic disturbances, which are main complications of both acute and long COVID-19. The S protein of SARS-CoV2, which acts as the receptor binding protein for the viral infection, is able to induce endothelial cells inflammation and it has been found as an isolated element in the circulation and in human tissues reservoirs months after infection. Here, we investigated whether the S protein is able to directly induce endothelial cell senescence and deciphered some of the mechanisms involved. In primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), SARS-CoV-2 S protein enhanced in a concentration-dependent manner the cellular content of senescence and DNA damage response markers (senescence-associated-β galactosidase, γH2AX), as well as growth-arrest effectors (p53, p21, p16). In parallel, the S protein reduced the availability of cytoprotective proteins, such as the anti-aging protein klotho, Nrf2 or heme oxygenase-1, and caused functional harm by impairing ex vivo endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation in murine microvessels. These effects were prevented by the pharmacological inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950. Furthermore, the supplementation with either recombinant klotho or angiotensin-(1-7), equally protected against the pro-senescence, pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant action of the S protein. Globally, this study proposes novel mechanisms of disease in the context of COVID-19 and its vascular sequelae and provides pharmacological clues in order to prevent such complications.",

    "abstract": "Biological age is a personalized measure of the health status of an organism, organ, or system, as opposed to simply accounting for chronological age. To date, there have been known attempts to create estimators of biological age based on various biomedical data. In this work, we focused on developing an approach for assessing heart biological age using echocardiographic data. The current study included echocardiographic data from more than 5,000 different cases. As a result, we created EchoAGE - neural network model to determine heart biological age, that was tested on echocardiographic data from patients with age-related diseases, patients with multimorbidity, children with progeria syndrome, and diachronic data series. The model estimates biological age with a Mean Absolute Error of approximately 3.5 years, an R-squared value of around 0.88, and a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient greater than 0.9 in men and women. EchoAGE uses indicators such as E/A ratio of maximum flow rates in the first and second phases, thicknesses of the interventricular septum and the posterior left ventricular wall, cardiac output, and relative wall thickness. In addition, we have applied an AI explanation algorithm to improve understanding of how the model performs an assessment.",

The myeloid enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) generates oxidative stress and contributes to damage after stroke. How aging changes MPO in stroke has not been studied. We aimed to determine the effects aging has on MPO and how these changes contribute to age-related differences in outcomes after ischemic stroke. To investigate tissue MPO activity we developed MPO Activatable Fluorescent Agent (MAFA). We found that aged mice exhibited worse neurological outcomes and higher mortality within the first few days after stroke. Accordingly, neuronal loss was higher in aged mice on day 3. MAFA imaging revealed that aged brains have markedly higher MPO activity that increased after stroke on day 3 compared to young adult brains. Correspondingly, we found more Iba1",

    "abstract": "Vascular aging is the pathological basis for the aging of various organ systems in the human body and is a common pathogenesis leading to the development of atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and other conditions among older adults. Aging is characterized by accelerated pulse wave velocity, thickening of the carotid artery intima-media, and decreased vascular dilation function. Signaling pathways such as mTOR, AMPK, NF-κB, Klotho, SIRT, and other key proteins are likely involved in these processes. The detection of biomarkers related to vascular aging, including senescence-associated β-galactosidase, endothelial progenitor cells, circulating endothelial microparticles, and exosomal miRNAs, aids in assessing vascular status and prognosis. Repairing endothelial injury, reducing oxidative stress-inflammatory responses, and restoring mitochondrial and telomere functions are reliable measures to counter vascular aging. In summary, research on vascular aging is the driving force that will provide rational strategies to intervene in geriatric vascular diseases and achieve the long-term goal of healthy aging.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages, a critical subset of innate immune cells, play a pivotal role in cytokine production during disease progression, tissue injury, and pathogen invasion. Their intricate involvement in the manifestation of chronic low-grade inflammation associated with the aging process is widely acknowledged. Notably, in aged tissues, macrophages exhibit an altered phenotype characterized by an augmented synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, a profile intimately associated with a phenomenon known as inflammaging. Macrophages possess the capacity to undergo cellular senescence, a state of permanent growth arrest, in response to diverse stressors, including aging. Senescent macrophages secrete an array of pro-inflammatory molecules, growth factors, and matrix metalloproteinases, collectively referred to as the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP). The SASP exacerbates the state of chronic inflammation observed in aging tissues. Thus, disruptions in macrophage function and signaling pathways due to aging result in escalated production of inflammatory mediators, perpetuating inflammaging. Recent research has uncovered novel mechanisms centred around innate immune signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction in macrophages, highlighting their crucial role in the development of inflammaging and associated pathological conditions. This review delves into the latest scientific findings on these emerging mechanisms in macrophage senescence related to aging and explores the prospects of targeting macrophages to address age- associated conditions effectively.",

    "abstract": "As a key member of the neurotrophin family in the central nervous system, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a critical role in the maintenance and plasticity of the nervous system. Its innate neuroprotective advantage can also be shared with the brain when normal aging-dependent processes challenge neural circuits. The intricate relationship between BDNF and resilience during the aging process signifies the molecular mechanisms that underlie the maintenance and protection of brain function, such as cognition, movement and psychological well-being. As BDNF is crucial for neuronal growth and survival, it can also promote resilience against age-related functional decline and frailty, even if it fails to entirely prevent aging-related functional decline. In the present review, we discuss BDNF function from a neuroprotective perspective and how it may promote resilience in aging. We emphasize briefly the principal, well-known cellular hallmarks of brain aging and how BDNF may restrict such disabling molecular dynamics and enhance overall functional resilience in aging. Insight into the molecular pathways through which BDNF reduces age-related brain dysfunctions and/or improves resilience, provides a foundation for developing targeted interventions to promote mental well-being in an aging population.",

Traditional biomarkers offer only partial perspectives, capturing limited aspects of the aging landscape. Yet, over the past decade, groundbreaking advancements have emerged. Epigenetic clocks, derived from DNA methylation patterns, have established themselves as powerful aging biomarkers, capable of estimating biological age and assessing aging rates across diverse tissues with remarkable precision. These clocks provide predictive insights into mortality and age-related disease risks, effectively distinguishing biological age from chronological age and illuminating enduring questions in gerontology. Despite significant progress in epigenetic clock development, substantial challenges remain, underscoring the need for continued investigation to fully unlock their potential in the science of aging.",

    "abstract": "Vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID), resulting from chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, represent the second most prevalent form of dementia globally. Aerobic exercise is widely acknowledged as an effective intervention for various cognitive disorders. This study utilized a bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) model to investigate whether aerobic exercise promotes cognitive recovery through the Annexin-A1 (ANXA1)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) axis in BCAS mice. Our findings demonstrate that aerobic exercise improved spatial memory in BCAS mice by enhancing white matter (WM) integrity and hippocampal function. WM integrity was confirmed through Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) staining and protein assays. Additionally, aerobic exercise mitigated BCAS-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) decay and upregulated hippocampal expression of key synaptic proteins, including N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunits NR2B and NR1, vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGluT1), and the synaptic scaffolding protein postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95). Furthermore, aerobic exercise enhanced the expression of the anti-inflammatory mediator ANXA1 through exosome secretion while simultaneously suppressing the MAPK signaling pathway. These molecular changes were associated with increased astrocyte proliferation and the polarization of astrocytes toward the A2 phenotype. These findings were further validated using an in vitro co-culture model of astrocytes (U251) and neurons (HT22). In summary, our study demonstrates that aerobic exercise improves WM integrity and hippocampal function by modulating the ANXA1/MAPK axis following astrocyte polarization. Thus, aerobic exercise emerges as a promising intervention for promoting functional recovery in VCID.",

    "abstract": "The gut-brain axis is a bidirectional communication pathway that modulates cognitive function. A dysfunctional gut-brain axis has been associated with cognitive impairments during aging. Therefore, we propose evaluating whether modulation of the gut microbiota through fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from young-trained donors (YT) to middle-aged or aged mice could enhance brain function and cognition in old age. Twelve-month-old male mice received an initial FMT from YT (YT-Tr) or age-matched donors (Auto-Tr) following antibiotic treatment. Three months later, the mice received a second FMT as reinforcement. Additionally, 18-month-old mice received Auto-Tr, YT-Tr, or FMT from young sedentary donors (YS-Tr). Cognitive function was assessed using novel object recognition and object location memory tests. Long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal brain slices was studied, while neuroinflammation and synaptic plasticity were analyzed in hippocampal samples via qPCR and immunoblot. Gut permeability was evaluated in ileum and colon sections, serum samples were analyzed for cytokine levels, and fecal samples were used to measure short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels and perform 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We observed that YT-Tr, whether performed in middle age or old age, improved cognitive function in aged mice. Recognition and spatial memory were significantly enhanced in YT-Tr mice compared to Auto-Tr and YS-Tr groups. Intact LTP was observed in YT-Tr mice at 18 months of age, whereas LTP was impaired in the Auto-Tr group. Neuroinflammation was reduced, and synaptic plasticity modulators such as PSD-95 and FNDC5/Irisin were upregulated in the hippocampus of YT-Tr mice compared to both YS-Tr and Auto-Tr groups. A significant reduction in ileal and colon permeability was detected in YT-Tr animals, along with elevated cecal levels of butyrate and valerate compared to Auto-Tr. Moreover, YT-Tr decreased pro-inflammatory factors and increased anti-inflammatory factors in the serum of aged mice. Beta diversity analysis revealed significant differences in microbial community composition between YT-Tr and Auto-Tr animals, with higher abundances of Akkermansia, Prevotellaceae_UCG-001, and Odoribacter in YT-Tr mice. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that FMT from young-trained donors improves cognitive function and synaptic plasticity by modulating gut permeability, inflammation, SCFA levels, and gut microbiota composition in aged mice.",

    "abstract": "Assessing impact on the hallmarks of aging has emerged as a novel method for prioritizing dual-purpose longevity therapeutic targets and developing drugs simultaneously targeting aging and disease. Cellular senescence, a central hallmark of aging, progressively induces cellular growth arrest and accelerates the production of a pro-inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). TGF-β signaling is situated at the center of multiple senescence-associated and aging-associated signaling pathways, and its inhibition may be favorable for aging-related disorders. A recently developed Traf2- and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK) inhibitor, INS018_055, was identified as a potent, novel anti-fibrotic agent affecting multiple hallmarks of aging across fibrotic diseases. Thus, we hypothesized that TNIK is a potential senescence modulator and INS018_055 could attenuate senescent cell accumulation to treat specific age-related pathological processes. Using a fully automated robotics laboratory designed for automated, highly parallel, and iterative phenotypic and multi-omic analyses, we determined that pharmacological or siRNA-mediated TNIK inhibition decreased cellular senescence in multiple experimental senescence models. INS018_055 mechanistically demonstrated senomorphic activity through its reduction of SASP. Furthermore, transcriptomics analysis revealed that INS018_055 treatment reduced aging signatures and extracellular matrix fibronectin through TGF-β signaling. These findings reveal TNIK's previously unappreciated role in cellular senescence and INS018_055's senomorphic potential in mitigating processes well-established as driving organismal aging. Thus, TNIK inhibition as a novel senomorphic strategy may inform future therapeutic approaches for diverse aging-related diseases.",

Lacunes, white matter hyperintensities (WMH), cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS), cortical superficial siderosis (cSS) and CSVD score were rated on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in primary ICH patients. Recurrent ICHs were confirmed by reviewing the medical records and MRI scans. Mixed hematomas were defined as follows: deep + lobar, deep + cerebellar, or deep + lobar + cerebellar. Of the 184 patients with primary ICH enrolled (mean age, 61.0 years; 75.5% men), recurrent ICH was present in 45 (24.5%) patients; 26.1% (48/184) had ≥2 hematomas, 93.8% (45/48) of which exhibited recurrent ICH. Mixed hematomas were identified in 8.7% (16/184) of patients and bilateral hematomas in 17.9% (33/184). All mixed hematomas and bilateral hematomas were from cases of recurrent ICH. Patients with mixed etiology-ICH were more likely to have recurrent ICH than patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) or hypertensive angiopathy (HA)-related ICH (36.8% vs17.8%, p=0.008). Multivariate ordinal regression analysis showed that the presence of recurrent ICH (p=0.001), ≥2 hematomas (p=0.002), mixed hematomas (p<0.00001), and bilateral hematomas (p=0.002) were separately significantly associated with a high CSVD score. Recurrent ICH occurs mostly among patients with mixed etiology-ICH and is associated with a higher CSVD burden than first-ever ICH, which needs to be verified by future larger studies.",

It is well-known that IgE and its receptor, FcɛR1, play a key role in the development of airway inflammation and remodeling in allergic asthma. Recent studies show that IgE also plays an important role in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) pathogenesis. However, the mechanism by which IgE promotes AAA remains unclear. Here we report that in our mouse model, asthma-induced high level of IgE aggravated AAA, but IgE lost this effect on AAA in FcɛR1-/- mice. Our in vitro study revealed that IgE induced smooth muscle cell senescence via upregulating lincRNA-p21 against p21 without altering expression of p53. By this mechanism, IgE accelerated AAA in ApoE-/- mice, which was blocked by knockdown of lincRNA-p21 in both vitro and vivo. This study suggests that IgE actives the lincRNAp21-p21 pathway to induce SMC senescence, which contributes to the formation of AAA, and lincRNA-p21 is a potential therapeutic target for AAA aggravated by asthma.",

    "abstract": "Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide. The prognostic influence of body temperature on acute stroke in patients has been recently reported; however, hypothermia has confounded experimental results in animal stroke models. This work aimed to investigate how body temperature could prognose stroke severity as well as reveal a possible mitochondrial mechanism in the association of body temperature and stroke severity. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) compromises mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in cerebrovascular endothelial cells (CVECs) and worsens murine experimental stroke. In this study, we report that LPS (0.1 mg/kg) exacerbates stroke infarction and neurological deficits, in the mean time LPS causes temporary hypothermia in the hyperacute stage during 6 hours post-stroke. Lower body temperature is associated with worse infarction and higher neurological deficit score in the LPS-stroke study. However, warming of the LPS-stroke mice compromises animal survival. Furthermore, a high dose of LPS (2 mg/kg) worsens neurological deficits, but causes persistent severe hypothermia that conceals the LPS exacerbation of stroke infarction. Mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I inhibitor, rotenone, replicates the data profile of the LPS-stroke study. Moreover, we have confirmed that rotenone compromises mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in CVECs. Lastly, the pooled data analyses of a large sample size (n=353) demonstrate that stroke mice have lower body temperature compared to sham mice within 6 hours post-surgery; the body temperature is significantly correlated with stroke outcomes; linear regression shows that lower body temperature is significantly associated with higher neurological scores and larger infarct volume. We conclude that post-stroke body temperature predicts stroke severity and mitochondrial impairment in CVECs plays a pivotal role in this hypothermic response. These novel findings suggest that body temperature is prognostic for stroke severity in experimental stroke animal models and may have translational significance for clinical stroke patients - targeting endothelial mitochondria may be a clinically useful approach for stroke therapy.",

    "abstract": "Flavonoids are known to trigger the intrinsic genetic adaptive programs to hypoxic or oxidative stress via estrogen receptor engagement or upstream kinase activation. To reveal specific structural requirements for direct stabilization of the transcription factors responsible for triggering the antihypoxic and antioxidant programs, we studied flavones, isoflavones and catechols including dihydroxybenzoate, didox, levodopa, and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), using novel luciferase-based reporters specific for the first step in HIF1 or Nrf2 protein stabilization. Distinct structural requirements for either transcription factor stabilization have been found: as expected, these requirements for activation of HIF ODD-luc reporter correlate with <i>in silico</i> binding to HIF prolyl hydroxylase. By contrast, stabilization of Nrf2 requires the presence of 3,4-dihydroxy- (catechol) groups. Thus, only some but not all flavonoids are direct activators of the hypoxic and antioxidant genetic programs. NDGA from the Creosote bush resembles the best flavonoids in their ability to directly stabilize HIF1 and Nrf2 and is superior with respect to LOX inhibition thus favoring this compound over others. Given much higher bioavailability and stability of NDGA than any flavonoid, NDGA has been tested in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-animal model of Parkinson’s Disease and demonstrated neuroprotective effects.",

    "abstract": "The G2385R variant of the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (<i>LRRK2</i>) is strongly associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) in Asian populations. However, it is still unclear whether the clinical phenotype of PD patients with the G2385R variant can be distinguished from that of patients with idiopathic PD. In this study, we investigated motor and non-motor symptoms of <i>LRRK2</i> G2385R variant carriers in a Chinese population. We genotyped 1031 Chinese PD patients for the G2385R variant of the <i>LRRK2</i> gene, and examined the demographic and clinical characteristics of <i>LRRK2</i> G2385R variant carrier and non-carrier PD patients. <i>LRRK2</i> G2385R variant carriers were more likely to present the postural instability and gait difficulty dominant (PIGD) phenotype. This variant was also significantly associated with motor fluctuations and the levodopa equivalent dose (LED). G2385R variant carriers had higher REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) screening questionnaire (RBDSQ) score and more RBD symptoms compared with non-carriers. We concluded that the G2385R variant could be a risk factor for the PIGD phenotype, motor fluctuations, LED values and RBD symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Subclinical hyperthyroidism is known to be associated with the risk of fractures in elderly people. However, there are few studies assessing whether low normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels affect bone density and geometry. Here, we aimed to assess the influence of the TSH level on bone mineral density (BMD) and geometry in elderly euthyroid subjects. This was a cross-sectional cohort study. A total of 343 men and 674 women with euthyroidism were included and analyzed separately. The subjects were divided into tertiles based on the serum TSH level. The BMD and geometry were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and a hip structural analysis program. Multiple regression analysis was used to compute the odds ratios of osteoporosis in the lower TSH tertile group and the association between geometry parameters and the TSH level. We found that the femoral neck and total hip BMDs were lower in the lower TSH tertile group. In women, the cross-sectional area and cortical thickness of the femur were negatively associated with the TSH level in all three regions (the narrow neck, intertrochanter, and femoral shaft); however, in men, these geometry parameters were significantly associated with the TSH level only in the intertrochanter region. The buckling ratio, a bone geometry parameter representing cortical instability, was significantly higher in the lower TSH tertile group in all three regions in women, but not in men. Our results indicated that lower TSH levels in the euthyroid range are related to lower BMD and weaker femoral structure in elderly women.",

Data were obtained in 3950 subjects (mean age 72.0 years, 1745 male) including 609 subjects aged ≥80 years in the Shanghai Elderly Cardiovascular Health Study (SHECHS). Established cardiovascular disease was present in 7.7% of participants. The prevalence of hypertension was 74.8% overall and it was more than 80% in individuals considered to be in moderate and higher cardiovascular disease risk categories. In hypertensive subjects, 67.1% were on treatment and treatment was more frequent in high and very high cardiovascular risk individuals. Attainment of the systolic blood pressure goal <150 mmHg was 62.9% and was greater in the ≥65 to <80 years group than in the ≥80 years group. The most commonly used antihypertensive treatments were calcium channel blockers (54.2%), followed by angiotensin receptor blockers (43.1%). Diuretics were used in 2.6%. Fixed-dose combination antihypertensive tablets were used in some of the ≥65 to <80 years group (12.4%) and more of the ≥80 years group (18.2%) and 70.9% of the ≥65 to <80 years group and 80.2% of the ≥80 years group were on monotherapy. There were high prevalence and high treatment rates of hypertension, but poor attainment of the systolic blood pressure goal of <150 mmHg, especially in the ≥80 years group of community-dwelling Chinese. Considering that more intensive treatment of hypertension in older subjects may be warranted after recent studies, this might be achieved by more frequent use of combinations of effective therapies and diuretics.",

    "abstract": "Frailty in elderly is very much familiar with a decline in the musculoskeletal system. Muscle degeneration in the lower organism was observed due to loss of anti-oxidant protein Sestrin. The aim of the study is to determine the level of Sestrin1 and Sestrin2 in the serum of frail and non-frail elderly to associate their impact in frailty syndrome. Subjects with age ≥ 65 years were enrolled from Geriatric Medicine OPD of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi (N= 92). Among them, 51 subjects were identified as frail and rest 41 were regarded as non-frail according to \"deficit accumulation model of Rockwood.\" The study was performed by surface plasmon resonance and validated by western blot. Sestrin1 and Sestrin2 were found to be significantly reduced in frail compare to non-frail elderly. Furthermore, even after the adjustment for age, gender and education, the level of Sestrin1 and Sestrin2 remain significantly lower across the groups. The Sestrin1 level was significantly lower in various categories like age, gender, BMI, education, ADL, number of co-morbidity along with other clinico-pathological features. ROC analysis also revealed the distinction of frail and non-frail in respect to serum Sestrin1 and Sestrin2. This study highlighted the new and promising role of serum Sestrin in frail and non-frail elderly. In future, it can be utilized as molecular marker to assess the potential diagnostic value for clinical purpose.",

    "abstract": "We estimate the weight of various risk factors in heart disease, and the particular weight of age as a risk factor, individually and combined with other factors. To establish the weights we use the information theoretical measure of normalized mutual information that permits determining both individual and combined correlation of diagnostic parameters with the disease status. The present information theoretical methodology takes into account the non-linear correlations between the diagnostic parameters, as well as their non-linear changes with age. Thus it may be better suited to analyze complex biological aging systems than statistical measures that only estimate linear relations. We show that individual parameters, including age, often show little correlation with heart disease. Yet in combination, the correlation improves dramatically. For diagnostic parameters specific for heart disease the increase in the correlative capacity thanks to the combination of diagnostic parameters, is less pronounced than for the less specific parameters. Age shows the highest influence on the presence of disease among the non-specific parameters and the combination of age with other diagnostic parameters substantially improves the correlation with the disease status. Hence age is considered as a primary \"metamarker\" of aging-related heart disease, whose addition can improve diagnostic capabilities. In the future, this methodology may contribute to the development of a system of biomarkers for the assessment of biological/physiological age, its influence on disease status, and its modifications by therapeutic interventions.",

For brain diseases, the neuroprotection paradigm desires an attenuation of the resulting motor, cognitive, emotional, or memory deficits following the insult. Preconditioning is a well-established experimental and clinical translational strategy with great beneficial effects, but limited applications. NMDA receptors have been reported as protagonists in the adjacent cellular mechanisms contributing to the development of brain tolerance. Postconditioning has recently emerged as a new neuroprotective strategy, which has shown interesting results when applied immediately, i.e. several hours to days, after a stroke event. Investigations using chemical postconditioning are still incipient, but nevertheless represent an interesting and promising clinical strategy. In the present review pre- and postconditioning are discussed as neuroprotective paradigms and the focus of our attention lies on the participation of NMDA receptors proteins in the processes related to neuroprotection.",

    "abstract": "Experimental cardiac arrest (CA) in aging research is infrequently studied in part due to the limitation of animal models. We aimed to develop an easily performed mouse CA model to meet this need. A standard mouse KCl-induced CA model using chest compressions and intravenous epinephrine for resuscitation was modified by blood withdrawal prior to CA onset, so as to decrease the requisite KCl dose to induce CA by decreasing the circulating blood volume. The modification was then compared to the standard model in young adult mice subjected to 8 min CA. 22-month old mice were then subjected to 8 min CA, resuscitated, and compared to young adult mice. Post-CA functional recovery was evaluated by measuring spontaneous locomotor activity pre-injury, and on post-CA days 1, 2, and 3. Neurological score and brain histology were examined on day 3. Brain elF2α phosphorylation levels were measured at 1 h to verify tissue stress. Compared to the standard model, the modification decreased cardiopulmonary resuscitation duration and increased 3-day survival in young mice. For aged mice, survival was 100 % at 24 h and 54% at 72 h. Neurological deficit was present 3 days post-CA, although more severe versus young mice. Mild neuronal necrosis was present in the cortex and hippocampus. The modified model markedly induced elF2α phosphorylation in both age groups. This modified procedure makes the CA model feasible in aged mice and provides a practical platform for understanding injury mechanisms and developing therapeutics for elderly patients.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes Mellitus is a common disorder, with increasing risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Studies have shown that altered connexin expression and gap junction remodeling under hyperglycemia contribute to the high prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias and even sudden death. Connexin 43 (Cx43), a major protein that assembles to form cardiac gap junctions, has been found to be downregulated under high glucose conditions, along with inhibition of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC). While, apelin, a beneficial adipokine, increases Cx43 protein expression in mouse and human embryonic stem cells during cardiac differentiation. However, it remains unknown whether apelin influences GJIC capacity in cardiomyocytes. Here, using Western blotting and dye transfer assays, we found that Cx43 protein expression was reduced and GJIC was impaired after treatment with high glucose, which, however, could be abrogated after apelin treatment for 48 h. We also found that apelin increased Cx43 expression under normal glucose. Real-time PCR showed that the Cx43 mRNA was not significantly affected under high glucose conditions in the presence of apelin or high glucose and apelin. High glucose decreased the phosphorylation of AMPKα; however, apelin activated AMPKα. Interestingly, we found that Cx43 expression was increased after treatment with AICAR, an activator of AMPK signaling. AMPKα inhibition mediated with transfection of siRNA-AMPKα1 and siRNA-AMPKα2 abolished the protective effect of apelin on Cx43 expression. Our data suggest that apelin attenuates high glucose-induced Cx43 downregulation and improves the loss of functional gap junctions partly through the AMPK pathway.",

    "abstract": "Hypothermia is considered as a promising neuroprotective treatment for ischemic stroke but with many limitations. To expand its clinical relevance, this study evaluated the combination of physical (ice pad) and pharmacological [transient receptor potential vanilloid channel 1 (TRPV1) receptor agonist, dihydrocapsaicin (DHC)] approaches for faster cooling and stronger neuroprotection. A total of 144 male Sprague Dawley rats were randomized to 7 groups: sham (n=16), stroke only (n=24), stroke with physical hypothermia at 31ºC for 3 h after the onset of reperfusion (n=24), high-dose DHC (H-DHC)(1.5 mg/kg, n=24), low-dose DHC (L-DHC)(0.5 mg/kg, n=32) with (n=8) or without (n=24) external body temperature control at ~38 ºC (L-DHC, 38 ºC), and combination therapy (L-DHC+ ice pad, n=24). Rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2 h. Infarct volume, neurological deficits and apoptotic cell death were determined at 24 h after reperfusion. Expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins was evaluated by Western blot. ATP and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by biochemical assays at 6 and 24 h after reperfusion. Combination therapy of L-DHC and ice pad significantly improved every measured outcome compared to monotherapies. Combination therapy achieved hypothermia faster by 28.6% than ice pad, 350% than L-DHC and 200% than H-DHC alone. Combination therapy reduced (p<0.05) neurological deficits by 63% vs. 26% with L-DHC. No effect was observed when using ice pad or H-DHC alone. L-DHC and ice pad combination improved brain oxidative metabolism by reducing (p<0.05) ROS at 6 and 24 h after reperfusion and increasing ATP levels by 42.9% compared to 25% elevation with L-DHC alone. Finally, combination therapy decreased apoptotic cell death by 48.5% vs. 24.9% with L-DHC, associated with increased anti-apoptotic protein and reduced pro-apoptotic protein levels (p<0.001). Our study has demonstrated that combining physical and pharmacological hypothermia is a promising therapeutic approach in ischemic stroke, and warrants further translational investigations.",

Previous studies using 18F-FDG PET mainly focused on the motor or non-motor symptoms but not the severity of IPD. In this study, we aimed to determine the metabolic patterns of 18F-FDG in different stages of IPD defined by Hoehn and Yahr rating scale (H-Y rating scale) and to identify regions in the brain that play critical roles in disease progression. Fifty IPD patients were included in this study. They were 29 men and 21 women (mean±SD, age 57.7±11.1 years, disease duration 4.0±3.8 years, H-Y 2.2±1.1). Twenty healthy individuals were included as normal controls. Following 18F-FDG PET scan, image analysis was performed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) and Resting-State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit (REST). The metabolic feature of IPD and regions-of-interests (ROIs) were determined. Correlation analysis between ROIs and H-Y stage was performed. SPM analysis demonstrated a significant hypometabolic activity in bilateral putamen, caudate and anterior cingulate as well as left parietal lobe, prefrontal cortex in IPD patients. In contrast, hypermetabolism was observed in the cerebellum and vermis. There was a negative correlation (p=0.007, r=-0.412) between H-Y stage and caudate metabolic activity. Moreover, the prefrontal area also showed a negative correlation with H-Y (P=0.033, r=-0.334). Thus, the uptake of FDG in caudate and prefrontal cortex can potentially be used as a surrogate marker to evaluate the severity of IPD.",

This study explored sex and urban-rural differences in disability transitions and life expectancies among older adults in China. Data were collected from the Chinese Longitudinal Health Longevity Survey (CLHLS), which enrolled people aged 65 and older and was conducted in randomly selected counties and cities across 22 provinces in China. Disability was diagnosed based on basic activities of daily living (BADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). Several individual characteristics were assessed, including sociodemographic factors (age, sex and region, etc.) and health behaviors (currently smoking, currently drinking, etc.). Multistate models were applied to analyze the transition rates among 4 states: no disability, mild disability, severe disability and death. The transition rates from disabled states to the no-disability state were found to decrease markedly with age. The rates of recovery from mild disability in rural areas were higher than those in urban areas. Rural elderly individuals lived shorter lives than their urban counterparts, but they tended to live with better functional status, spending a larger fraction of their remaining life with less severe disability. Based on these findings, devoting more attention and resources to rural areas may help less severely disabled people recuperate and prevent severe disability. The study provides insights into health plan strategies to help guide the allocation of limited resources.",

By the year 2050, it is expected that the world population in that age range will reach 2000 million, an increase of 900 million with respect to 2015, which poses new challenges for health systems. In this way, it is relevant to analyze the most common diseases associated with the aging process, namely Alzheimer´s disease, Parkinson Disease and Type II Diabetes, some of which may have a common genetic component that can be detected before manifesting, in order to delay their progress. Genetic inheritance and epigenetics are factors that could be linked in the development of these pathologies. Some researchers indicate that the BDNF gene is a common factor of these diseases, and apparently some of its polymorphisms favor the progression of them. In this regard, alterations in the level of BDNF expression and secretion, due to polymorphisms, could be linked to the development and/or progression of neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders. In this review we will deepen on the different polymorphisms in the BDNF gene and their possible association with age-related pathologies, to open the possibilities of potential therapeutic targets.",

Morbidities such as spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) and memory and mood impairments are seen in a significant fraction of SE survivors despite the administration of antiepileptic drugs after SE. We examined the efficacy of bilateral intra-hippocampal grafting of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs) derived from the embryonic day 19 rat hippocampi, six days after SE for restraining SE-induced SRS, memory, and mood impairments in the chronic phase. Grafting of NSCs curtailed the progression of SRS at 3-5 months post-SE and reduced the frequency and severity of SRS activity when examined at eight months post-SE. Reduced SRS activity was also associated with improved memory function. Graft-derived cells migrated into different hippocampal cell layers, differentiated into GABA-ergic interneurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Significant percentages of graft-derived cells also expressed beneficial neurotrophic factors such as the fibroblast growth factor-2, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, insulin-like growth factor-1 and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor. NSC grafting protected neuropeptide Y- and parvalbumin-positive host interneurons, diminished the abnormal migration of newly born neurons, and rescued the reelin+ interneurons in the dentate gyrus. Besides, grafting led to the maintenance of a higher level of normal neurogenesis in the chronic phase after SE and diminished aberrant mossy fiber sprouting in the dentate gyrus. Thus, intrahippocampal grafting of hippocampal NSCs shortly after SE considerably curbed the progression of epileptogenic processes and SRS, which eventually resulted in less severe chronic epilepsy devoid of significant cognitive and mood impairments.",

    "abstract": "Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) confers protection on major organs from hypoxic/ischemic injuries; however, its impacts on attention network function and blood oxygen levels in unacclimatized adults exposed to high altitudes have yet to be elucidated. In this study, we recruited 120 healthy male volunteers, of which one was exposed to high altitude and the other was exposed to low altitude. The two cohorts were further divided into RIC and sham control groups. The attentional network test (ANT) was performed to evaluate cognitive function before and after RIC treatment. Other outcomes such as heart rate, blood pressure, blood oxygen saturation, cerebral tissue oxygenation index (CTOI), and cerebrovascular hemodynamic indices were also evaluated. Prior to RIC treatment, there were no significant differences in orienting or executive function between the treatment and control arms of either cohort. Alerting function was significantly lower in the high-altitude cohort than in the low-altitude cohort. There were significant reductions in both blood oxygen and CTOI in the high-altitude cohort relative to the low-altitude cohort, while the pulse index (PI) of the former cohort was significantly increased. After RIC treatment, there was a significant difference in alerting function between the high-altitude RIC group and its associated control. The CTOI of the treatment group increased from 60.39±3.40% to 62.78±4.40%, and blood oxygenation also improved. Furthermore, this group showed a significant reduction in its PI. Exposure to high-altitude environments had a significant impact on alerting function, blood oxygen, CTOI, and PI. RIC ameliorated changes in attentional function, as well as blood oxygen and CTOI, suggesting that it potentially alters cerebrovascular compliance upon exposure to high altitude.",

    "abstract": "It is proposed that the beneficial action of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in COVID-19 and other inflammatory diseases could be attributed to their ability to secrete bioactive lipids (BALs) such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and lipoxin A4 (LXA4) and other similar BALs. This implies that MSCs that have limited or low capacity to secrete BALs may be unable to bring about their beneficial actions. This proposal implies that pretreatment of MSCs with BALs enhance their physiological action or improve their (MSCs) anti-inflammatory and disease resolution capacity to a significant degree. Thus, the beneficial action of MSCs reported in the management of COVID-19 could be attributed to their ability to secrete BALs, especially PGE2 and LXA4. Since PGE2, LXA4 and their precursors AA (arachidonic acid), dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) and gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory IL-6 and TNF-α, they could be employed to treat cytokine storm seen in COVID-19, immune check point inhibitory (ICI) therapy, sepsis and ARDS (acute respiratory disease). This is further supported by the observation that GLA, DGLA and AA inactivate enveloped viruses including COVID-19. Thus, infusions of appropriate amounts of GLA, DGLA, AA, PGE2 and LXA4 are of significant therapeutic benefit in COVID-19, ICI therapy and other inflammatory conditions including but not limited to sepsis. AA is the precursor of both PGE2 and LXA4 suggesting that AA is most suited for such preventive and therapeutic approach.",

    "abstract": "India has witnessed a high number of COVID-19 cases, but mortality has been quite low, and most cases have been asymptomatic or mild. In early April, we had hypothesized a low COVID-19 mortality in India, based on the concept of cross-immunity. The presence of cross-immunity is presumed to lead to a milder course of disease and allow the time necessary for the development of adaptive immunity by the body to eliminate the virus. Evidence supporting our hypothesis has started showing up. Multiple studies have shown the generation of different T cell subsets and B cells responding to epitopes of viral proteins, especially of the spike protein, as a part of adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Cross-reactive T-cells have been demonstrated in patients who have been previously exposed to endemic coronaviruses. The interplay of cross-immunity and herd immunity is apparent in the COVID-19 scenario in India from the presence of a large number of asymptomatic or mild cases, a low infection-fatality ratio and a generally flat curve of percentage positivity of cases with respect to total testing, both in periods of strict lock-down and step-wise unlocking. It seems that cross-immunity resulted in faster generation of herd immunity. Although the initial restrictive measures such as lockdown prevented the rapid spread of the outbreak, further extension of such measures and overly expensive ones such as enhanced testing in India will result in a huge burden on the health economics as well as the society. Hence, we propose a restructuring of the health services and approach to COVID-19. The restructured health services should move away from indiscriminate testing, isolation and quarantine, and instead, the emphasis should be on improving facilities for testing and management of only critical COVID cases and the replacement of complete lockdowns by the selective isolation and quarantine of susceptible persons such as the aged and those with co-morbidities. In the process of describing India-specific plans, we emphasize why the development of country-specific plans for tackling epidemics is important, instead of adopting a \"one policy fits all\" approach.",

However, the use of DBS can be a paradoxical conundrum—dementia treatments aim to improve memory, whereas anxiety or addiction treatments aim to suppress maladaptive memory. In this review, the key hypotheses on how DBS affects memory are highlighted. We consolidate the findings and conclusions from the current research on the effects of DBS on memory in attempt to make sense of the bidirectional nature of DBS in disrupting and enhancing memory. Based on the current literature, we hypothesize that the timing of DBS plays a key role in its contradictory effects, and therefore, we propose a consolidated model of how DBS can both disrupt and enhance memory.",

Oxidative damage is an important mechanism involved in aging. The latest discovery pertaining to oxidative damage is that 8-oxoGsn (8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine), an oxidative damage product of RNA, can represent the level of oxidative stress. The significance of RNA oxidative damage to aging has not been fully explained, but the relationship between the accumulation of 8-oxoGsn, a marker of RNA oxidative damage, and the occurrence of diseases has been confirmed in many aging-related diseases. Studying the aging mechanism, monitoring the aging level of the body and exploring the corresponding countermeasures are of great significance for achieving healthy aging and promoting public health and social development. This article reviews the progress of research on 8-oxoGsn in aging-related diseases.",

In searching for the changes in the brain extracellular space (ECS) induced by electrical pain stimuli in the rat thalamus, significantly decreased effective diffusion coefficient (D<sub>ECS</sub>) and volume fraction (α) of the brain ECS were shown, accompanied by the slowdown of ISF drainage. The morphological basis for structural changes in the brain ECS was local spatial deformation of astrocyte foot processes following neuronal excitation. We further studied aquaporin-4 gene (<i>APQ4</i>) knockout rats in which the changes of the brain ECS structure were reversed and found that the slowed D<sub>ECS</sub> and ISF drainage persisted, confirming that the down-regulation of ISF drainage following neuronal excitation was mainly attributable to the release of neurotransmitters rather than to structural changes of the brain ECS. Meanwhile, the dynamic changes in the D<sub>ECS</sub> were synchronized with the release and elimination processes of neurotransmitters following neuronal excitation. In conclusion, the downregulation of ISF drainage following neuronal excitation was found to be caused by the restricted diffusion in the brain ECS, and D<sub>ECS</sub> mapping may be used to track the neuronal activity in the deep brain.",

    "abstract": "An ever-increasing ageing population has elevated Alzheimer's disease to be one of the biggest challenges in modern medicine.Alzheimer's disease is highly complex, and we are still no closer to understanding the causes, let alone an effective treatment.The lack of good experimental models and lack of critical understanding has led to high failure rates of clinical trials with high associated costs, as well as difficulties in implementing treatments.The multifaceted nature of this disease highlights the need for an interdisciplinary approach to address these concerns.In this essay, we suggest how collaborative work can be useful in addressing some of the above issues.We then propose that international organisations and publishers need to support interdisciplinary research by creating platforms, lobbying funders, and pushing for interdisciplinary publications.We further highlight some of the issues involved in implementing these suggestions and argue that willpower of the research community, together with a re-evaluation of evaluation metrics and incentive systems, are needed in order to foster interdisciplinary research.Overall, we emphasise the need for interdisciplinary research in Alzheimer's disease and suggest that international societies should play a huge role in this endeavour.",

As successful drug treatments have not yet been identified, non-pharmaceutical interventions such as physical exercise and training have been employed to improve the memory function of people with dementia. We investigated the effect of prolonged physical running on hippocampal-dependent spatial memory and its underlying mechanisms using a well-established rodent model of AD. 3xTg-AD transgenic mice and non-transgenic mice were subjected to voluntary wheel running for 5 months (1 hour per day, 5 days per week), followed by spatial memory testing. After the behavioral testing, dendritic spines, synapses, and synaptic proteins as well as amyloid-beta (Aβ) pathology were analyzed in the dorsal hippocampi. Running improved hippocampal-dependent spatial memory in 3xTg-AD mice. This running strategy prevented both thin and mushroom-type spines on CA1 pyramidal cells in 3xTg-AD mice, whereas the effects of running in non-transgenic mice were limited to thin spines. The enormous effects of running on spines were accompanied by an increased number of synapses and upregulated expression of synaptic proteins. Notably, running downregulated the processing of amyloid precursor protein, decreasing intracellular APP expression and extracellular Aβ accumulation, and spatial memory performance correlated with levels of Aβ peptides Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42. These data suggest that prolonged running may improve memory in preclinical AD via slowing down the amyloid pathology and preventing the loss of synaptic contacts.",

    "abstract": "Vascular age-related diseases describe a group of age-related chronic diseases that result in a considerable healthcare burden to society. Vascular aging includes structural changes and dysfunctions of endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in blood vessels. Compared with conventional treatment for vascular age-related diseases, stem cell (SC) therapy elicits better anti-aging effects <i>via</i>the inhibition/delay ECs and SMCs from entering senescence. Exosomal noncoding RNA (ncRNAs) in vascular aging and stem cell-derived exosomal microRNAs (SCEV-miRNAs), especially in mesenchymal stem cells, have an important role in the development of age-related diseases. This review summarizes SCEV-miRNAs of diverse origins that may play a vital role in treating subclinical and clinical stages of vascular age-related disorders. We further explored possible age-related pathways and molecular targets of SCEV-miRNA, which are associated with dysfunctions of ECs and SMCs in the senescent stage. Moreover, the perspectives and difficulties of SCEV-miRNA clinical translation are discussed. This review aims to provide greater understanding of the biology of vascular aging and to identify critical therapeutic targets for SCEV-miRNAs. Though still in its infancy, the potential value of SCEV-miRNAs for vascular age-related diseases is clear.",

    "abstract": "Modern healthcare systems are founded on a disease-centric paradigm, which has conferred many notable successes against infectious disorders in the past. However, today's leading causes of death are dominated by non-infectious \"lifestyle\" disorders, broadly represented by the metabolic syndrome, atherosclerosis, cancer, and neurodegeneration. Our disease-centric paradigm regards these disorders as distinct disease processes, caused and driven by disease targets that must be suppressed or eliminated to clear the disease. By contrast, a health-centric paradigm recognizes the lifestyle disorders as a series of hormonal and metabolic responses to a singular, lifestyle-induced disease of mitochondria dysfunction, a disease target that must be restored to improve health, which may be defined as optimized mitochondria function. Seen from a health-centric perspective, most drugs target a response rather than the disease, whereas metabolic strategies, such as fasting and carbohydrate-restricted diets, aim to restore mitochondria function, mitigating the impetus that underlies and drives the lifestyle disorders. Substantial human evidence indicates either strategy can effectively mitigate the metabolic syndrome. Preliminary evidence also indicates potential benefits in atherosclerosis, cancer, and neurodegeneration. Given the existing evidence, integrating metabolic strategies into modern healthcare systems should be identified as a global health priority.",

    "abstract": "The important role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in pathogenic store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) is well-established. Among the proteins involved in the calcium signaling pathway, Stromal interacting molecule 1 (STIM1) is a critical endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane protein. STIM1 is activated by the depletion of calcium stores and then binds to another calcium protein, Orai1, to form a channel through which the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> can enter the cytoplasm to replenish the calcium store. Multiple studies have shown that increased STIM1 facilitates the aberrant proliferation and apoptosis of vascular smooth cells (VSMC) and macrophages which can promote the formation of rupture-prone plaque. Together with regulating the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, STIM1 also activates STING through altered intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, a critical pro-inflammatory molecule. The cGAS-STING pathway is linked with cellular proliferation and phenotypic conversion of VSMC and enhances the progression of atherosclerosis plaque. In summary, we conclude that STIM1/cGAS-STING is involved in the progression of AS and plaque vulnerability.",

A great deal of neuroHIV research has so far been focused on Tat protein, its effects on astrocytes, and its roles in neuroHIV. In the current study, we aimed to determine effects of Nef expression on astrocytes and their function. Using transfection or infection of VSVG-pseudotyped HIV viruses, we showed that Nef expression down-modulated glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression. We then showed that Nef expression also led to decreased GFAP mRNA expression. The transcriptional regulation was further confirmed using a GFAP promoter-driven reporter gene assay. We performed transcription factor profiling array to compare the expression of transcription factors between Nef-intact and Nef-deficient HIV-infected cells and identified eight transcription factors with expression changes of 1.5-fold or higher: three up-regulated by Nef (Stat1, Stat5, and TFIID), and five down-regulated by Nef (AR, GAS/ISRE, HIF, Sp1, and p53). We then demonstrated that removal of the Sp1 binding sites from the GFAP promoter resulted in a much lower level of the promoter activity and reversal of Nef effects on the GFAP promoter, confirming important roles of Sp1 in the GFAP promoter activity and for Nef-induced GFAP expression. Lastly, we showed that Nef expression led to increased glutamate uptake and decreased glutamate release by astrocytes and increased astrocyte proliferation. Taken together, these results indicate that Nef leads to down-modulation of GFAP expression and alteration of glutamate metabolism in astrocytes, and astrocyte proliferation and could be an important contributor to neuroHIV.",

Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase type-1 gamma (Pip5k1c), a lipid kinase catalyzing the synthesis of phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), is involved in various cellular processes, such as focal adhesion (FA) formation, cell migration, and cellular signal transduction. However, whether Pip5k1c plays a role in the pathogenesis of OA remains unclear. Here we show that inducible deletion of Pip5k1c in aggrecan-expressing chondrocytes (cKO) causes multiple spontaneous OA-like lesions, including cartilage degradation, surface fissures, subchondral sclerosis, meniscus deformation, synovial hyperplasia, and osteophyte formation in aged (15-month-old) mice, but not in adult (7-month-old) mice. Pip5k1c loss promotes extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, chondrocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis, and inhibits chondrocyte proliferation in the articular cartilage of aged mice. Pip5k1c loss dramatically downregulates the expressions of several key FA proteins, including activated integrin β1, talin, and vinculin, and thus impairs the chondrocyte adhesion and spreading on ECM. Collectively, these findings suggest that Pip5k1c expression in chondrocytes plays a critical role in maintaining articular cartilage homeostasis and protecting against age-related OA.",

    "abstract": "The population of older individuals is increasing rapidly, but only a small fraction among them is able to experiences a healthy life. Due to lack of physical exercise and oxidative stress, aging leads to sarcopenia and finally end up with frailty. Sarcopenia is a component of the frailty and described as age related degenerative changes in the skeletal muscle mass, strength and quality. Though the loss of muscle strength and mass gradually seem inevitable during aging, it can be partially prevented or overcome by a deeper insight into the pathogenesis. Sirtuin protein leads to longevity across different organisms ranging from worms to mammals. Expression of sirtuin protein increases during physical exercise and thus strengthens muscle mass. Satellite cells leads to muscle repair in a SIRT1 dependent manner. In addition, SIRT1 improves insulin sensitivity and induces autophagy in the aged mice. The current paper discussed the putative role of sirtuins in sarcopenia and frailty. Moreover, it highlighted the pathways by which sirtuins can inhibit ROS production, inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunctions and therefore confers a protective role against frailty and sarcopenia. The critical role of sirtuins in the sarcopenia and frailty pathogenesis can eventually fuel the development of novel interventions by targeting sirtuins.",

    "abstract": "The senescence of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) impairs their regenerative capacity to maintain tissue homeostasis. Numerous studies are focusing on the interventions and mechanisms to attenuate the senescence of MSCs. C-phycocyanin (C-PC) is reported to have multiple functions such as antitumor, antioxidation, anti-inflammation and anti-aging roles, but there is little research about the effects of C-PC on the senescence of MSCs. Here we investigated the roles and mechanism of C-PC on MSCs senescence. <i>In vitro </i>results showed that C-PC could reduce senescence, enhance proliferation, promote the adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation in senescent MSCs induced by oxidative stress. <i>In vivo</i> D-Galactose (D-Gal) induced rats aging models showed C-PC also increased the viability and differentiation of intrinsic senescent bone marrow derived MSCs (BMSCs). Furthermore, C-PC also decreased the levels of oxidative stress markers ROS or MDA, elevated the SOD activity, and increased the anti-inflammatory factors. Proteomic chip analysis showed that C-PC interacted with ZDHHC5, and their interaction was verified by pull down assay. Overexpression of ZDHHC5 aggravated the senescence of MSCs and greatly lessened the beneficial effects of C-PC on senescence. In addition, we found ZDHHC5 regulated autophagy by altering LC3, Beclin1 and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. In summary, our data indicated that C-PC ameliorates the senescence of MSCs through zinc finger Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) domain-containing protein 5 (ZDHHC5) mediated autophagy via PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. The present study uncovered the key role of autophagy in MSCs senescence and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway may be a potential target for anti-senescence studies of MSCs.",

    "abstract": "Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) have a higher risk of incident and aggravating frailty over time. Frailty-initiating risk factors have been identified, but modulators of frail severity over time remain poorly defined. We aimed to explore the influences of glucose-lowering drug (GLD) strategy on DM patients' risk of increasing frail severity. We retrospectively identified type 2 DM patients between 2008 and 2016, dividing them into \"no GLD\", oral GLD (oGLD) monotherapy, oGLD combination, and those receiving insulin without or with oGLD at baseline. Increasing frail severity, defined as ≥1 FRAIL component increase, was the outcome of interest. Cox proportional hazard regression was utilized to analyze the risk of increasing frail severity associated with GLD strategy, accounting for demographic, physical data, comorbidities, medication, and laboratory panel. After screening 82,208 patients with DM, 49,519 (no GLD, 42.7%; monotherapy, 24.0%; combination, 28.5%; and insulin user, 4.8%) were enrolled for analysis. After 4 years, 12,295 (24.8%) had increasing frail severity. After multivariate adjustment, oGLD combination group exhibited a significantly lower risk of increasing frail severity (hazard ratio (HR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 - 0.94), while the risk of insulin users increased (HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02 - 1.21) than no GLD group. Users receiving more oGLD exhibited a trend of less risk reduction relative to others. In conclusion, we discovered that the strategy of oral glucose lowering drugs combination might reduce the risk of frail severity increase. Accordingly, medication reconciliation in frail diabetic older adults should take into account their GLD regimens.",

Driving is an important instrumental activity of daily living, essential for independence. However, this is a complex skill. A moving vehicle can be a dangerous tool in the hand of someone who cannot maneuver it properly. As a result, the assessment of driving capacity should be part of the management of dementia. Moreover, dementia comprises of different etiologies and stages consisting of different presentations. As a result, this study aims to identify driving behaviors common in dementia and compare different assessment methods. A literature search was conducted using the PRISMA checklist as a framework. A total of forty-four observational studies and four meta-analyses were identified. Study characteristics varied greatly with regards to methodology, population, assessments, and outcome measures used. Drivers with dementia performed generally worse than cognitively normal drivers. Poor speed maintenance, lane maintenance, difficulty managing intersections and poor response to traffic stimuli were the most common behaviors in drivers with dementia. Naturalistic driving, standardized road assessments, neuropsychological tests, participant self-rating and caregiver rating were the most common driving assessment methods used. Naturalistic driving and on-road assessments had the highest predictive accuracy. Results on other forms of assessments varied greatly. Both driving behaviors and assessments were influenced by different stages and etiologies of dementia at varying degrees. Methodology and results in available research are varied and inconsistent. As a result, better quality research is required in this field.",

    "abstract": "Adult lungs present high cellular plasticity against stress and injury, mobilizing stem/progenitor populations from conducting airways to maintain tissue homeostasis and gas exchange in alveolar spaces. With aging, pulmonary functional and structural deterioration occurs, mainly in pathological conditions, which is associated with impaired stem cell activity and increased senescence in mice. However, the impact of these processes underlying lung physiopathology in relation to aging has not been explored in humans. In this work, we analyzed stem cell (SOX2, p63, KRT5), senescence (p16<sup>INK4A</sup>, p21<sup>CIP</sup>, Lamin B1) and proliferative (Ki67) markers in lung samples from young and aged individuals, with and without pulmonary pathology. We identified a reduction in SOX2<sup>+</sup> cells but not p63<sup>+</sup> and KRT5<sup>+ </sup>basal cells in small airways with aging. In alveoli, we revealed the presence of triple SOX2<sup>+</sup>, p63<sup>+</sup> and KRT5<sup>+</sup> cells specifically in aged individuals diagnosed with pulmonary pathologies. Notably, p63<sup>+</sup> and KRT5<sup>+</sup> basal stem cells displayed colocalization with p16<sup>INK4A</sup> and p21<sup>CIP</sup>, as well as with low Lamin B1 staining in alveoli. Further studies revealed that senescence and proliferation markers were mutually exclusive in stem cells with a higher percentage colocalizing with senescence markers. These results provide new evidence of the activity of p63<sup>+</sup>/KRT5<sup>+</sup> stem cells on human lung regeneration and point out that regeneration machinery in human lung is activated under stress due to aging, but fails to repair in pathological cases, as stem cells would likely become senescent.",

This is becoming increasingly challenging as an increase in life expectancy is accompanied by the tendency to conceive at older ages. With advancing maternal age, the fertilized egg will exhibit lower quality and developmental competence, which contributes to increased chances of miscarriage due to several causes such as aneuploidy, oxidative stress, epigenetics, or metabolic disorders. In particular, heterochromatin in oocytes and with it, the DNA methylation landscape undergoes changes. Further, obesity is a well-known and ever-increasing global problem as it is associated with several metabolic disorders. More importantly, both obesity and aging negatively affect female reproduction. However, among women, there is immense variability in age-related decline of oocytes' quantity, developmental competence, or quality. Herein, the relevance of obesity and DNA-methylation will be discussed as these aspects have a tremendous effect on female fertility, and it is a topic of continuous and widespread interest that has yet to be fully addressed for the mammalian oocyte.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of a recent worldwide coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 primarily causes an acute respiratory infection but can progress into significant neurological complications in some. Moreover, patients with severe acute COVID-19 could develop debilitating long-term sequela. Long-COVID is characterized by chronic symptoms that persist months after the initial infection. Common complaints are fatigue, myalgias, depression, anxiety, and \"brain fog,\" or cognitive and memory impairments. A recent study demonstrated that a mild COVID-19 respiratory infection could generate elevated proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the cerebral spinal fluid. This commentary discusses findings from this study, demonstrating that even a mild respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause considerable neuroinflammation with microglial and macrophage reactivity. Such changes could also be gleaned by measuring chemokines and cytokines in the circulating blood. Moreover, neuroinflammation caused by mild SARS-CoV-2 infection can also impair hippocampal neurogenesis, deplete oligodendrocytes, and decrease myelinated axons. All these changes likely contribute to cognitive deficits in long-COVID syndrome. Therefore, strategies capable of restraining neuroinflammation, maintaining better hippocampal neurogenesis, and preserving oligodendrocyte lineage differentiation and maturation may prevent or reduce the incidence of long-COVID after SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infection.",

Immunosenescence may lead to a low-grade, sterile chronic inflammation in a multifactorial and dynamic way, which plays a critical role in most age-related diseases. Age-related changes in the gut microbiota also shape the immune and inflammatory responses. Nutrition is a determinant of immune function and of the gut microbiota. Immunonutrion has been regarded as a new strategy for disease prevention and management, including many age-related diseases. However, the understanding of the cause-effect relationship is required to be more certain about the role of immunonutrition in supporting the immune homeostasis and its clinical relevance in elderly individuals. Herein, we review the remarkable quantitative and qualitative changes during aging that contribute to immunosenescence, inflammaging and microbial dysbiosis, and the effects on late-life health conditions. Furthermore, we discuss the clinical significance of immunonutrition in the treatment of age-related diseases by systematically reviewing its modulation of the immune system and the gut microbiota to clarify the effect of immunonutrition-based interventions on the healthy aging.",

    "abstract": "Maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis is crucial for ensuring healthy mitochondria and normal cellular function. This process is primarily responsible for regulating processes that include mitochondrial OXPHOS, which generates ATP, as well as mitochondrial oxidative stress, apoptosis, calcium homeostasis, and mitophagy. Bone mesenchymal stem cells express factors that aid in bone formation and vascular growth. Positive regulation of hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow affects the differentiation of osteoclasts. Furthermore, the metabolic regulation of cells that play fundamental roles in various regions of the bone, as well as interactions within the bone microenvironment, actively participates in regulating bone integrity and aging. The maintenance of cellular homeostasis is dependent on the regulation of intracellular organelles, thus understanding the impact of mitochondrial functional changes on overall bone metabolism is crucially important. Recent studies have revealed that mitochondrial homeostasis can lead to morphological and functional abnormalities in senescent cells, particularly in the context of bone diseases. Mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal diseases results in abnormal metabolism of bone-associated cells and a secondary dysregulated microenvironment within bone tissue. This imbalance in the oxidative system and immune disruption in the bone microenvironment ultimately leads to bone dysplasia. In this review, we examine the latest developments in mitochondrial respiratory chain regulation and its impacts on maintenance of bone health. Specifically, we explored whether enhancing mitochondrial function can reduce the occurrence of bone cell deterioration and improve bone metabolism. These findings offer prospects for developing bone remodeling biology strategies to treat age-related degenerative diseases.",

Overcoming this challenge requires identifying biomarkers, risk factors, and effective therapeutic interventions that might provide meaningful clinical benefits. For Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most studied NCD, approved drugs include acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (rivastigmine, donepezil, and galantamine), an NMDA receptor antagonist (memantine), and anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies (aducanumab and lecanemab). These drugs offer limited relief, targeting singular pathological processes of the AD. Given the multifactorial nature of the NCDs, a poly-pharmacological strategy may lead to improved outcomes compared to the current standard of care. In this regard, phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors emerged as promising drug candidates for the treatment of neurocognitive disorders. These inhibitors increase cGMP levels and CREB signaling, thus enhancing learning, memory and neuroprotection, while reducing Aβ deposition, tau phosphorylation, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. In the present article, we evaluate the therapeutic potential of different PDE5 inhibitors to outline their multifaceted impact in the NCDs.",

Isthmin-1 (ISM1) is a novel adipokine that promotes glucose uptake and acts indispensable roles in restraining inflammatory and fibrosis. The present study aims to investigate the potential role and molecular mechanism of ISM1 in aging-related cardiac dysfunction. Aged and matched young mice were overexpressed or silenced with ISM1 to investigate the role of ISM1 in aging-related cardiac dysfunction. Moreover, H9C2 cells were stimulated with D‐galactose (D-gal) to examine the role of ISM1 in vitro. Herein, we found that cardiac-specific overexpression of ISM1 significantly mitigated insulin resistance by promoting glucose uptake in aging mice. ISM1 overexpression alleviated while ISM1 silencing deteriorated cellular senescence, cardiac inflammation, and dysfunction in natural and accelerated cardiac aging. Mechanistically, ISM1 promoted glycolysis and activated Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) through increasing glucose uptake. ISM1 increased glucose uptake via translocating GLUT4 to the surface, thereby enhancing glycolytic flux and hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) flux, ultimately leading to increased SIRT1 activity through O-GlcNAc modification. ISM1 may serve as a novel potential therapeutic target for preventing aging-related cardiac disease in elderly populations. ISM1 prevents aging-related cardiac dysfunction by promoting glycolysis and enhancing SIRT1 deacetylase activity, making it a promising therapeutic target for aging-related cardiac disease.",

The condition referred to as aging myasthenia gravis impairs older persons' quality of life and is linked to a higher risk of several chronic illnesses.

Specifically, by promoting autophagy, aerobic exercise helps to postpone the onset of senile myasthenia gravis. In this work, we will explore how aerobic exercise modulates autophagy to prevent muscle aging and examine the most recent findings in this area of study. We discovered that exercise-induced autophagy can effectively balance protein degradation and relieve skeletal muscle atrophy by looking through pertinent literature. Aerobic exercise has a direct impact on autophagy, but it can also delay the onset of senile myasthenia gravis by enhancing blood flow, lowering inflammation, and boosting muscle oxidative capacity. In order to postpone the onset of senile myasthenia gravis, research on the mechanism of action of aerobic exercise in inducing autophagy will be discussed in detail in this study.",

In recent years, an abundance of research on human aging has surfaced. Intriguingly, evidence suggests a pervasive correlation among gut microbiota, bodily functions, and chronic diseases. From infancy to later stages of adulthood, healthy individuals witness dynamic shifts in gut microbiota composition. This microbial community is associated with tissue and organ function deterioration (e.g., brain, bones, muscles, immune system, vascular system) and heightened risk of age-related diseases. Thus, we present a narrative review of the aging gut microbiome in both healthy and unhealthy aging contexts. Additionally, we explore the potential for adjustments to physical health based on gut microbiome analysis and how targeting the gut microbiome can potentially slow down the aging process.",

    "abstract": "It is widely accepted that living organisms form highly dynamic membrane-less organelles (MLOS) with various functions through phase separation, and the indispensable role that phase separation plays in the mechanisms of normal physiological functions and pathogenesis is gradually becoming clearer. Pathological aggregates, regarded as hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases, have been revealed to be closely related to aberrant phase separation. Specific proteins are assembled into condensates and transform into insoluble inclusions through aberrant phase separation, contributing to the development of diseases. In this review, we present an overview of the progress of phase separation research, involving its biological mechanisms and the status of research in neurodegenerative diseases, focusing on five main disease-specific proteins, tau, TDP-43, FUS, α-Syn and HTT, and how exactly these proteins reside within dynamic liquid-like compartments and thus turn into solid deposits. Further studies will yield new perspectives for understanding the aggregation mechanisms and potential therapeutic strategies, and future research directions are anticipated.",

    "abstract": "Non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) often carries a dire prognosis. The advent of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (NCI) has become a promising approach in NSCLC treatment, making the identification of reliable biomarkers for major pathological response (MPR) crucial. This study aimed to devise a deep learning (DL) model to estimate the MPR to NCI in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) patients and uncover its biological mechanism. We enrolled a cohort of 309 LUSC patients from various medical institutions. A ResNet50 model, trained on contrast-enhanced computed tomography images, was developed, and validated to predict MPR. We examined somatic mutations, genomic data, tumor-infiltrating immune cells, and intra-tumor microorganisms. Post-treatment, 149 (48.22%) patients exhibited MPR. The DL model demonstrated excellent predictive accuracy, evidenced by an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.98-1.00) and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.81-0.98) in the first and second validation sets, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified the DL model score (low vs. high) as an independent predictor of MPR. The prediction of MPR (P-MPR) correlated with mutations in four genes, as well as gene ontology and pathways tied to immune response and antigen processing and presentation. Analysis also highlighted diversity in immune cells within the tumor microenvironment and in peripheral blood. Moreover, the presence of four distinct bacteria varied among intra-tumor microorganisms. Our DL model proved highly effective in predicting MPR in LUSC patients undergoing NCI, significantly advancing our understanding of the biological mechanisms involved.",

    "abstract": "As human life expectancy continues to rise, becoming a pressing global concern, it brings into focus the underlying mechanisms of aging. The increasing lifespan has led to a growing elderly population grappling with age-related diseases (ARDs), which strains healthcare systems and economies worldwide. While human senescence was once regarded as an immutable and inexorable phenomenon, impervious to interventions, the emerging field of geroscience now offers innovative approaches to aging, holding the promise of extending the period of healthspan in humans. Understanding the intricate links between aging and pathologies is essential in addressing the challenges presented by aging populations. A substantial body of evidence indicates shared mechanisms and pathways contributing to the development and progression of various ARDs. Consequently, novel interventions targeting the intrinsic mechanisms of aging have the potential to delay the onset of diverse pathological conditions, thereby extending healthspan. In this narrative review, we discuss the most promising methods and interventions aimed at modulating aging, which harbor the potential to mitigate ARDs in the future. We also outline the complexity of senescence and review recent empirical evidence to identify rational strategies for promoting healthy aging.",

This condition may generate a mismatch between brain's energy reserve and expenditure, mainly during high metabolic demand, which could be involved in the chronification of migraine and, in the long run, at least in certain subsets of patients, in the prodromic phase of Alzheimer's disease, along a putative metabolic physiopathological continuum. Indeed, the persistent disruption of glucose homeostasis and energy supply to neurons may eventually impair protein folding, an energy-requiring process, promoting pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease, such as amyloid-β deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation. Hopefully, the \"neuroenergetic hypothesis\" presented herein will provide further insight on there being a conceivable metabolic bridge between chronic migraine and Alzheimer's disease, elucidating novel potential targets for the prophylactic treatment of both diseases.",

Here, we set out to define specific molecular profiles of CVD in patients with DAT to better understand its relationship, to unravel the mechanisms underlying the high risk of developing DAT in CVD patients and to define new markers of early disease. Plasma samples from patients with DAT, with and without CVD, were analyzed through a multiomics approach, with integration of metabolomics and proteomics datasets using the OmicsNet web-based tool. Metabolomics results showed an enrichment in lipids and lipid-like molecules. Similarly, the most significant cluster identified through proteomics was formed by 5 proteins related to lipoprotein and cholesterol metabolism. After integration and functional enrichment, glycerolipid metabolism, fatty acid degradation and sphingolipid metabolism were among the most significant functions. Finally, differential expression of ABCA1 and APOH proteins was verified, in an independent cohort also including controls and patients with CVD alone. Both proteins positively correlated with phospho-Tau (181), a classical hallmark of DAT. Different molecular profiles exist in patients with DAT, with and without CVD, with exacerbated alterations in patients in which DAT and CVD co-exist. This information may help to define biomarkers like ABCA1 and APOH that identify patients with cardiovascular dysfunction that are at high risk of developing DAT. Such markers will allow more personalized interventions to be selected, a further step towards precision medicine for individuals whose molecular profiles indicate a distinct response to the same management strategies.",

    "abstract": "Astrocytes play a crucial role in maintaining brain homeostasis by regulating synaptic activity, providing metabolic support to neurons, and modulating immune responses in the central nervous system (CNS). During aging, astrocytes undergo senescence with various changes that affect their function and frequently lead to neurodegeneration. This study presents the first evidence of senescent astrocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). These senescent hPSC-derived astrocytes exhibited altered cellular and nuclear morphologies, along with increased expression of senescence-associated markers. Additionally, nuclear localization of NFκB, telomere shortening, and frequent signs of DNA damage were observed in these cells. Furthermore, senescent astrocytes showed defects in various critical functions necessary for maintaining a healthy CNS environment, including a reduced ability to support neuronal survival and clear neurotransmitters, synaptic debris, and toxic protein aggregates. Altered structural dynamics and reduced mitochondrial function were also observed in senescent astrocytes. Notably, treating hPSC-derived senescent astrocytes with chemicals targeting reactive oxygen species or an enzyme that regulates mitochondrial function can reverse senescence phenotypes. Thus, this study offers a valuable cellular model that can be utilized to investigate the mechanisms of brain aging and may present new avenues for discovering innovative therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Although detrimental changes in mitochondrial morphology and function are widely described symptoms of fetal alcohol exposure, no studies have followed these mitochondrial deficits into adult life or determined if they predispose individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) to accelerated biological aging. Here, we used a multiplex preclinical mouse model to compare markers of cellular senescence and age-related outcomes induced by maternal, paternal, and dual-parental alcohol exposures. We find that even in middle life (postnatal day 300), the adult offspring of alcohol-exposed parents exhibited significant increases in markers of stress-induced premature cellular senescence in the brain and liver, including an upregulation of cell cycle inhibitory proteins and increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity. Strikingly, in the male offspring, we observe an interaction between maternal and paternal alcohol use, with histological indicators of accelerated age-related liver disease in the dual-parental offspring exceeding those induced by either maternal or paternal alcohol use alone. Our studies indicate that chronic parental alcohol use causes enduring mitochondrial dysfunction in offspring, resulting in a reduced NAD+/NAHD ratio and altered expression of the NAD+-dependent deacetylases SIRT1 and SIRT3. These observations suggest that some aspects of FASDs may be linked to accelerated aging due to programmed changes in the regulation of mitochondrial function and cellular bioenergetics.",

    "abstract": "Stroke, a leading cause of death and disability, often results from ischemic events that cut off the brain blood flow, leading to neuron death. Despite treatment advancements, survivors frequently endure lasting impairments. A key focus is the ischemic penumbra, the area around the stroke that could potentially recover with prompt oxygenation; yet its monitoring is complex. Recent progress in bioluminescence-based oxygen sensing, particularly through the Green enhanced Nano-lantern (GeNL), offers unprecedented views of oxygen fluctuations in vivo. Utilized in awake mice, GeNL has uncovered hypoxic pockets within the cerebral cortex, revealing the brain's oxygen environment as a dynamic landscape influenced by physiological states and behaviors like locomotion and wakefulness. These findings illuminate the complexity of oxygen dynamics and suggest the potential impact of hypoxic pockets on ischemic injury and recovery, challenging existing paradigms and highlighting the importance of microenvironmental oxygen control in stroke resilience. This review examines the implications of these novel findings for stroke research, emphasizing the criticality of understanding pre-existing oxygen dynamics for addressing brain ischemia. The presence of hypoxic pockets in non-stroke conditions indicates a more intricate hypoxic scenario in ischemic brains, suggesting strategies to alleviate hypoxia could lead to more effective treatments and rehabilitation. By bridging gaps in our knowledge, especially concerning microenvironmental changes post-stroke, and leveraging new technologies like GeNL, we can pave the way for therapeutic innovations that significantly enhance outcomes for stroke survivors, promising a future where an understanding of cerebral oxygenation dynamics profoundly informs stroke therapy.",

    "abstract": "As a neurodegenerative disease closely related to age-related changes, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is rapidly becoming one of the most resource-intensive and deadly diseases of this century. As a systemic neurotransmitter system with widespread distribution throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems, the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) system not only plays an important role in antidepressant therapy but also shows potential value in improving AD symptoms. The 5-HT system may facilitate the prevention and treatment of AD by impacting its pathological processes through various pathways, such as the regulation of Aβ deposition, hyperphosphorylation of Tau, central and peripheral neuroinflammation, and the interactions with the cholinergic and BDNF systems. In addition, regular exercise, as a non-pharmacological intervention, provides systemic and multi-level physical health benefits. Given the high sensitivity of the 5-HT system to exercise, this paper reviews its crucial role and potential mechanisms in alleviating AD through exercise. From perspective of the integrative biology of exercise, we propose several crosstalk mechanisms between the peripheral and central systems mediated by the 5-HT system. These mechanisms serve as a bridge for the treatment of AD and offer novel ideas and strategies for future therapeutic approaches.",

This comprehensive review provides a multifaceted perspective on the organ-joint crosstalk contributing to OA, transcending the traditional focus on local joint pathology. Based on current research, we discussed the brain-joint, gut-joint, muscle-joint interactions in the etiology and progression of OA. In brain-joint axis, the neuroendocrine regulation, circadian rhythms, and leptin signaling influence joint tissues. We also discussed the role of prostaglandin E2 in skeletal interoception and its potential as a therapeutic target. The gut-joint axis is underscored by the impact of gut microbiota dysbiosis on systemic inflammation and metabolic disorders, both of which are implicated in OA pathogenesis. Furthermore, age-related sarcopenia, characterized by muscle mass and strength loss, is identified as a significant risk factor. Sarcopenia may contribute to OA progression through compromised mechanical support, systemic inflammation, and muscle-derived myokines. Finally, we synthesize the evidence supporting the modulation of circadian rhythm, skeletal interoception, gut microbiome, and muscle mass as innovative strategies for OA management. The organ-joint crosstalk is integral to the complex pathogenesis of OA, highlighting the multifactorial nature of OA and the potential for targeted therapeutic interventions. By integrating these multidimensional perspectives, we aim to enhance our understanding of OA pathogenesis and explore potential pharmacological targets.",

    "abstract": "This review summarizes the mechanism and role of physical activity in maintaining the proper functioning of the musculoskeletal system. Bone adaptation to the mechanical environment occurs in skeletal regions subjected to the greatest stresses resulting from the nature of exercise, however, there is a varied response of bone tissue to mechanical loads depending on its material and structural properties (trabecular and cortical). The regulation of bone tissue metabolism during physical exercise is influenced by factors associated with mechanical stress (gravitational forces, impact loading, and muscular contractions) as well as by systemic mechanisms (hormones, myokines, cytokines). The presence of insulin receptors and glucose transporters in osteoblasts indicates that these cells consume large amounts of glucose. Therefore, when energy demand during physical activity increases, nutritional factors play an important role in bone response. On the other hand, the musculoskeletal system participates in the regulation of energy metabolism. To maintain bone homeostasis, an optimized form of physical activity should be used (e.g. intensity, duration, training session frequency). The complexity of factors modulating the sensitivity of bones to mechanical stimuli causes the results of physical training are age- and sex-dependent. Moreover, when selecting exercises to improve bone health, it is important to take into account metabolic and musculoskeletal system conditions. In addition, exercise should be safe and adapted to the health and fitness level so as not to increase the risk of fractures. Participation in regular physical activity should continue after the training program to maintain bone mass.",

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common joint disease, which is mainly characterized by the degeneration of articular cartilage, inflammation of the synovial membrane of the joint, and changes in the surrounding bone tissue. With the increase of age and weight, the incidence of OA gradually increases, which seriously affects the quality of life of patients. The primary pharmacological treatments for OA include analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, these medications primarily provide symptomatic relief and are associated with significant side effects. Chitosan, derived from the deacetylation of chitin, has excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and can promote the repair of articular cartilage. Chitosan can be used as a viscosupplement, drug carrier, cartilage tissue engineering scaffold or other forms. In this review, we systematically summarize the applications of chitosan and its derivatives in the treatment of OA.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease [AD] disproportionately affects our seniors, diminishing their health and life expectancy. As the world population grows older, the collective burden of AD has become unsustainable. Globally, there were 43.8 million patients in 2016, with a projection of affecting 152 million by 2050. Recent discoveries have shown that molecular changes characteristic to AD manifested 20 years before discernable neurological phenotypes emerge. It is feasible to halt or reverse this pathological process before reaching an irremediable stage. To take advantage of this treatment window, we need to make rapid progress in early detection and monitoring, targeted implementation of preventative measures, invention of novel therapeutics, and pragmatic ramping-up of relevant supporting policies. PET is a powerful tool for prognosis. The utilization of AI technology, on the other hand, has favorable features of low cost per capita, easy dissemination and broad scale data collection to uncover previously unknown hotspots or risk factors. FDA approved drugs, lecanemab and donanemab, have started to show efficacy to put a pause on AD progression. Additional clinical data will enable comprehensive evaluation of the impacts of these drugs. Gene therapy holds the potential of eliciting long term protection, while several candidate loci have been identified. The urgency of a tsunami of rising AD epidemiology demands rapid actions on all fronts of advanced diagnostics, monitoring, preventative and interventive strategies.",

Whereas, a global role of microRNAs (miRNAs) has also been demonstrated to control and maintain TEC-constituting thymic microenvironment and to be changed in expression profile in the aged thymus. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to build knowledge regarding whether and which miRNAs regulate FoxN1 gene in the aged thymus. We primarily compared changes in miRNA expression profile between young and aged murine TECs with Mus musculus miRBase-V20 arrays (containing 1892 unique probes), and clearly identified and validated that at least one miRNA, miR-125a-5p, was increased in aged thymus. Applying miR-125a-5p mimics was able to inhibit FoxN1 3'UTR luciferase activity in a 293T cell line and to suppress FoxN1 expression in murine TEC Z210 cells. Since a single miRNA can play a fine-tuning role to regulate expression of multiple genes and a single gene can be regulated by multiple miRNAs, our result adds a single miRNA, miR-125a-5p, into the panel of FoxN1-regulating miRNAs associated with thymic aging.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism by which angiogenesis declines with aging is not fully understood. Soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1) form (sFlt1) contributes to endothelial dysfunction in pathological conditions. However, the roles of sFlt1 in ischemia-induced neovascularizationof aged animals have not been investigated. To study aging-related sFlt1 change and its impact on ischemia-induced neovascularization, a hindlimb ischemia model was applied to young and aged mice. Blood flow imaging assay revealed that the blood flow recovery remained impaired throughout the follow-up period. At day 14, immunostaining showed lesser capillary formation in the aged mice. An ELISA showed that the aged mice had increased plasma sFlt-1 levels at indicated time points after surgery. On operative day 4, the aged ischemic muscles had decreased levels of p-VEGFR2 and p-Akt and increased levels of sFlt-1, Wnt5a, and SC35 genes or/and protein as well as increased numbers of inflammatory cells (macrophages and leucocytes) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity. Immnunofluorescence showed that Flt-1 was co-localized with CD11b+ macrophages of aged ischemic muscles. Hypoxia stimulated sFlt1 expression in CD11b+ cells of aged bone-marrow (BM), and this effect was diminished by siWnt5a. The cultured medium of aged mice BM-derived CD11b+ cells suppressed human endothelial cell (EC) and endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) angiogenic actions induced by VEGF, and these decreases were improved by treatment with siWnt5a-conditioned medium. Thus, aging appears to decline neovascularization in response to ischemic stress via the VEGFR2/Akt signaling inactivation in ECs and ECPs that is mediated by Wnt5a/SC35 axis activated macrophages-derived sFlt1 production in advanced age.",

    "abstract": "Statins have proven to exert protective effects in patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (SICAS). It is unclear whether intensive lipid-lowering therapy (ILLT) can ameliorate atherosclerosis in asymptomatic ICAS (AICAS). A single-center, prospective cohort study was performed in 71 AICAS patients with lipid-lowering therapy. Vascular stenoses were evaluated with transcranial color-coded sonography (TCCS) before and after statin treatment. With target therapeutic level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≤ 1.8 mmol/L or ≥ 50% reduction from baseline after the two years of follow-up, patients were divided into intensive statin treatment (IST) group and standard statin treatment (SST) group. A total of 104 stenotic intracranial arteries were detected in 51 patients belonging to the IST group and 47 arteries in 20 patients of the SST group. In the first year, LDL-C levels were significantly decreased in the IST compared with SST groups (1.48 ± 0.26 vs. 2.20 ± 0.58, P=0.000). However, the ratio of regressed ICAS in IST was not significantly higher than that in SST (26.3% vs. 5.9%, P=0.052). Forty-nine branches in 25 patients of the IST group and 16 branches in 7 patients of the SST group were followed up for two years. The LDL-C level was decreased in the IST compared with SST groups (1.55 ± 0.29 vs. 2.36 ± 0.77, P=0.048). The ratio of regressed ICAS in the IST group was significantly higher than that in SST group (34.7% vs. 6.3%, P=0.017). We concluded that the degree of stenosis in AICAS can be ameliorated with intensive lipid-lowering therapy within two years; target LDL-C level can be reached by moderate-intensity statin treatment for Chinese AICAS patients.",

The objective in this study was to identify more reliable prognostic biomarkers of ALS mirroring neurodegeneration that could be of help in clinical trials. A total of 268 participants from three cohorts were included in this study. The muscle and blood cohorts were analyzed in two cross-sectional studies, while the serial blood cohort was analyzed in a longitudinal study at 6-monthly intervals. Fifteen target genes and fourteen proteins involved in muscle physiology and differentiation, metabolic processes and neuromuscular junction dismantlement were studied in the three cohorts. In the muscle biopsy cohort, the risk for a higher mortality in an ALS patient that showed high Collagen type XIX, alpha 1 (COL19A1) protein levels and a fast progression of the disease was 70.5% (P < 0.05), while in the blood cohort, this risk was 20% (P < 0.01). In the serial blood cohort, the linear mixed model analysis showed a significant association between increasing COL19A1 gene levels along disease progression and a faster progression during the follow-up period of 24 months (P < 0.05). Additionally, higher COL19A1 levels and a faster progression increased 17.9% the mortality risk (P < 0.01). We provide new evidence that COL19A1 can be considered a prognostic biomarker that could help the selection of homogeneous groups of patients for upcoming clinical trial and may be pointed out as a promising therapeutic target in ALS.",

A total of 31 AD patients and 20 healthy controls (HC) who underwent both MRI examination and clinical assessment were included in this study. Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) was acquired with 14 b-values in the range of 0 and 5000 s/mm<sup>2</sup>. Diffusivity was analyzed in selected regions, including the amygdala (AMY), hippocampus (HIP), thalamus (THA), caudate (CAU), globus pallidus (GPA), lateral ventricles (LVe), white matter (WM) of the frontal lobe (FL), WM of the temporal lobe (TL), WM of the parietal lobe (PL) and centrum semiovale (CS). The mean, median, skewness and kurtosis of the conventional apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), DKI (including two variables, D<sub>app</sub> and K<sub>app</sub>) and ADC_uh values were calculated for these selected regions. Compared to the HC group, the ADC values of AD group were significantly higher in the right HIP and right PL (WM), while the ADC_uh values of the AD group increased significantly in the WM of the bilateral TL and right CS. In the AD group, the K<sub>app</sub> values in the bilateral LVe, bilateral PL/left TL (WM) and right CS were lower than those in the HC group, while the D<sub>app</sub> value of the right PL (WM) increased. The ADC_uh value of the right TL was negatively correlated with MMSE (mean, r=-0.420, p=0.019). The ADC value and D<sub>app</sub> value have the same regions correlated with MMSE. Compared with the ADC_uh, combining ADC_uh and ADC parameters will result in a higher AUC (0.894, 95%CI=0.803-0.984, p=0.022). Comparing to ADC or DKI, ADC_uh has no significant difference in the detectability of AD, but ADC_uh can better reflect characteristic alternation in unconventional brain regions of AD patients.",

These effects of genistein lead to enhanced accumulation of amyloid beta peptide (Aβ42) in SHSY5Y cells. The results do not support the view that genistein could be a putative drug against AD and instead strengthen the epidemiological study which implies that genistein content of soybean food product (Tofu) leads to cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "Aging intersects with reproductive senescence in women by promoting a systemic low-grade chronic inflammation that predisposes women to several diseases including ovarian cancer (OC). OC risk at menopause is significantly modified by parity records during prior fertile life. To date, the combined effects of age and parity on the systemic inflammation markers that are particularly relevant to OC initiation and progression at menopause remain largely unknown. Herein, we profiled a panel of circulating cytokines in multiparous versus virgin C57BL/6 female mice at peri-estropausal age and investigated how cytokine levels were modulated by intraperitoneal tumor induction in a syngeneic immunocompetent OC mouse model. Serum FSH, LH and TSH levels increased with age in both groups while prolactin (PRL) was lower in multiparous respect to virgin mice, a finding previously observed in parous women. Serum CCL2, IL-10, IL-5, IL-4, TNF-α, IL1-β and IL-12p70 levels increased with age irrespective of parity status, but were specifically reduced following OC tumor induction only in multiparous mice. Animals developed hemorrhagic ascites and tumor implants in the omental fat band and other intraperitoneal organs by 12 weeks after induction, with multiparous mice showing a significantly extended survival. We conclude that previous parity history counteracts aging-associated systemic inflammation possibly by reducing the immunosuppression that typically allows tumor spread. Results suggest a partial impairment of the M2 shift in tumor-associated macrophages as well as decreased stimulation of regulatory B-cells in aged mice. This long term, tumor-concurrent effect of parity on inflammation markers at menopause would be a contributing factor leading to decreased OC risk.",

Each 1 h session included 5 min warming-up exercise, 50 min specific training [aerobic, strength, or combined], and 5 min stretching. Blood samples were drawn 72 h before [baseline] the beginning of the 8 weeks' protocol and 48 h after the last training session, processed, and the serum was aliquoted and stored at -70 °C until biochemical assessment of oxidative damage, antioxidant system and neurotrophic, growth and inflammatory factors. Elevated BDNF or IGF-1 levels were observed in the ATdl or CTdl groups, respectively. Overall oxidative stress parameters were improved including reduced lipid oxidative damage and increased thioredoxin reductase and glutathione peroxidase activities and total glutathione. Significant decreases in the inflammatory mediators IL-6 and IL-8 were observed; IL-6 was more susceptible to the effects of type of physical training. Thus, the effects of training in elderly men vary in an exercise type-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Ischemic stroke is a major cause of death and disability globally, and its incidence is increasing. The only treatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for acute ischemic stroke is thrombolytic treatment with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. As an alternative, therapeutic hypothermia has shown excellent potential in preclinical and small clinical studies, but it has largely failed in large clinical studies. This has led clinicians to explore the combination of therapeutic hypothermia with other neuroprotective strategies. This review examines preclinical and clinical progress towards developing highly effective combination therapy involving hypothermia for stroke patients.",

    "abstract": "The relationship of white-matter hyperintensity (WMH) to intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains unclear. In this retrospective study, we investigated whether the severity and progression of WMH could be related to the hematoma volume and absorption in ICH. 2338 WMH patients with ICH aged≥40 years receiving brain computed tomography (CT) imaging within 12 hours of ICH symptom onset were screened, and 227 patients were included in the final study. The severity and progression of WMH were assessed using the software programs MRICRON and ITK-SNAP on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the hematoma volumes and absorption with ITK-SNAP software on CT. We assessed the association of WMH severity with ICH volume in 227 patients at baseline. Totally 183 of 227 patients underwent repeated CT within 14 days of ICH onset. The relationship of WMH severity to ICH absorption was analyzed in 183 patients. Additionally, among all 227 patients, 37 subjected to another MRI before ICH onset were divided into two groups according to WMH progression: non-progression and progression groups. The link between WMH progression and hematoma volume was examined. The ICH volume was significantly larger in patients with the highest WMH scores than in those with the lowest WMH scores. Larger WMH volume was independently associated with larger ICH volume (odds ratio 1.00; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.00; P = 0.049). There was a trend towards WMH progression being related to ICH volume (P =0.049). Contrastingly, the WMH volume was not linked with hematoma absorption (P = 0.79). In conclusion, we found that greater severity and progression of WMH were associated with larger ICH volume. Our findings suggest that WMH might provide important prognostic information about patients with ICH and may have implications for treatment stratification.",

    "abstract": "Premature aging syndromes are rare genetic disorders mimicking clinical and molecular features of aging. Products of the LMNA gene, primarily lamin A and C, are major components of the nuclear lamina. A recently identified group of premature aging syndromes was related to mutations of the LMNA gene. Although LMNA disorders have been identified in premature aging syndromes, affect specifically the skeletal muscles, cardiac muscles, and lipodystrophy, understanding the pathogenic mechanisms still need to be elucidated. Here, to establish a rabbit knockout (KO) model of premature aging syndromes, we performed precise LMNA targeting in rabbits via co-injection of Cas9/sgRNA mRNA into zygotes. The LMNA-KO rabbits exhibited reduced locomotion activity with abnormal stiff walking posture and a shortened stature, all of them died within 22 days. In addition, cardiomyopathy, muscular dystrophy, bone and joint abnormalities, as well as lipodystrophy were observed in LMNA-KO rabbits. In conclusion, the novel rabbit LMNA-KO model, displayed typical features of histopathological defects that are observed in premature aging syndromes, and may be utilized as a valuable resource for understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of premature aging syndromes and elucidating mysteries of the normal process of aging in humans.",

    "abstract": "The level of cerebellar activity in stroke patients has been shown to correlate with the extent of functional recovery. We reasoned that the cerebellum may be an important player in post-stroke rehabilitation. Because the neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) represent virtually all of the output from the cerebellum, in this study, using environmental enrichment (EE) to promote rehabilitation, we investigated the influence of the optogenetic neuronal modulation of DCN on EE-induced rehabilitation. We found that neuronal inhibition of the DCN almost completely blocked motor recovery in EE treated mice, but the stroke mice with neuronal activation of the DCN achieved a similar recovery level as those in the EE treated group. No difference was observed in anxiety-like behavior. Moreover, Htr2a in the DCN, the gene encoding 5-HT2A receptor, was shown to be a hub gene in the protein-protein interaction network identified using RNA-seq. This indicated that 5-HT2A receptor-mediated signaling may be responsible for DCN-dependent functional improvement in EE. We further verified this using the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, MDL100907, to inhibit the function of 5-HT2A receptor in the DCN. This treatment resulted in impaired recovery in EE treated mice, who performed at a level as poor as the stroke-only group. Thus, this work contributes to an understanding of the importance of the DCN activation in EE-induced post-stroke rehabilitation. Attempts to clarify the mechanism of 5-HT2A receptor-mediated signaling in the DCN may also lead to the creation of a pharmacological mimetic of the benefits of EE-induced rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "Age-related hearing loss (ARHL), a degenerative disorder characterized by age-dependent progressive increase in the threshold of auditory sensitivity, affects 40% of people over the age of 65, and it has emerged as an important social and public health problem. Various factors, including genetic and environmental components, are known to affect both the onset and severity of ARHL. In particular, age-dependent changes in cellular oxidative stress and inflammatory responses accompanied by altered cellular signaling and gene expression progressively affect the function of the auditory system and eventually lead to hearing impairment. Recent findings suggest that a disturbance of intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> levels is clinically related to the progression of age-associated disorders. Therefore, maintenance of optimal intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> levels may be a critical factor for cellular senescence, and thus, understanding its molecular signaling pathways would provide critical insights into the prevention and treatment of ARHL as well as other age-related diseases. In this review, we describe the role of NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism in aging and age-related diseases, including ARHL, and discuss a potential strategy for prevention or treatment of ARHL with a particular interest in NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent cellular pathways.",

The distribution of CMBs in thirty-two post-mortem brains, consisting of 12 AD, 8 AD-CAA and 12 controls, was mutually compared on T2*-GRE MRI of six coronal sections of a cerebral hemisphere. The mean numbers of CMBs were determined in twenty-two different gyri. As a whole there was a trend of more CMBs on GRE MRI in the prefrontal section of the AD, the AD-CAA as well as of the control brains. Compared to controls AD brains had significantly more CMBs in the superior frontal, the inferior temporal, the rectus and the cinguli gyrus, and in the insular cortex. In AD-CAA brains CMBs were increased in all gyri with exception of the medial parietal gyrus and the hippocampus. AD-CAA brains showed a highly significant increase of CMBs in the inferior parietal gyrus (p value: 0.001) and a significant increase in the precuneus and the cuneus (p value: 0.01) compared to the AD brains. The differences in topographic distribution of CMBs between AD and AD-CAA brains should be further investigated on MRI in clinically suspected patients.",

We aimed to evaluate both parasympathetic and sympathetic cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction in older PD cases. 84 PD cases and 58 controls, for a total of 142, participated in the study. Parasympathetic tests were performed using electrocardiography. Sympathetic tests were assessed by blood pressure measurement and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement. The prevalence of orthostatic hypotension in PD patients was 40.5% in PD patients and 24.1% in the control group (p> 0.05). The prevalence of postprandial hypotension was 47.9% in the PD group and 27.5% in the controls (p <0.05). The prevalence of impairment in heart rate response to deep breathing was 26.2% in the PD group and 6.9% in the control group (p <0.05). The prevalence of postprandial hypotension in PD with orthostatic hypotension was 94% and 16% in PD patients without orthostatic hypotension (p <0.05). The prevalence of impairment in heart rate response to deep breathing was 52.9% in PD patients with orthostatic hypotension and 8% in PD cases without orthostatic hypotension (p<0.05). The prevalence of impairment in heart rate response to postural change was 41% in PD cases with orthostatic hypotension and 12% in PD cases without orthostatic hypotension (p <0.05).Although there are tests for assessing cardiovascular autonomic function that are more reliable, they are more complicated, and evaluation of orthostatic hypotension by blood pressure measurement and cardiac autonomic tests by electrocardiography are recommended since these tests are cheap and easy.",

These proteins were further determined by Gene Ontology term analysis and network with CD200-CD200R1, CCL21-CXCR3 and transcription factors. Three of them: Abca13, Grb2 and Ptgds were verified by qPCR and ELISA. We found the protein level of Abca13 and the mRNA level of Grb2 consistent with results from the proteomic analysis.

In this study, we investigated whether the loss of SS or KC is associated with the above factors in NREM 3 (N3) sleep. A total of 152 cases were enrolled from 2013 to 2017. The correlations between the number of SS or KC in N3 sleep and participants' characteristics were analyzed using Spearman rank correlation. Chi-squared test was used to assess the effects of age, sleep efficiency, and BMI on the loss of N3 sleep, N3 spindle and N3 KC. Our results showed that there were negative correlations between the number of SS in N3 sleep with age, BMI, and AHI (P < 0.001), and similar trends were found for KC as well. The loss of SS and KC in N3 sleep was related with age, BMI, and AHI (P < 0.01), as was the loss of N3 sleep (P < 0.01). However, sleep efficiency was not related with the loss of N3 sleep, SS and KC in N3 sleep (P > 0.05).

    "abstract": "Transient forebrain ischemia induces delayed death of the hippocampal pyramidal neurons, particularly in the CA2 and medial CA1 area. Early pharmacological inhibition of inflammatory response can ameliorate neuronal death, but it also inhibits processes leading to tissue regeneration. Therefore, research efforts are now directed to modulation of post-ischemic inflammation, with the aim to promote beneficial effects of inflammation and limit adverse effects. Transcription factor NF-κB plays a key role in the inflammation and cell survival/apoptosis pathways. In the brain, NF-κB is predominantly found in the form of a heterodimer of p65 (RelA) and p50 subunit, where p65 has a transactivation domain while p50 is chiefly involved in DNA binding. In this study, we subjected middle-aged Nfkb1 knockout mice (lacking p50 subunit) and wild-type controls of both sexs to 17 min of transient forebrain ischemia and assessed mouse performance in a panel of behavioral tests after two weeks of post-operative recovery. We found that ischemia failed to induce clear memory and motor deficits, but affected spontaneous locomotion in genotype- and sex-specific way. We also show that both the lack of the NF-κB p50 subunit and female sex independently protected CA2 hippocampal neurons from ischemia-induced cell death. Additionally, the NF-κB p50 subunit deficiency significantly reduced ischemia-induced microgliosis, astrogliosis, and neurogenesis. Lower levels of hippocampal microgliosis significantly correlated with faster spatial learning. We conclude that NF-κB regulates the outcome of transient forebrain ischemia in middle-aged subjects in a sex-specific way, having an impact not only on neuronal death but also specific inflammatory responses and neurogenesis.",

In this study, we further evaluated the effects of pretreatment with ginseng fruit saponins (GFS) on the expression of 5-HT and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R in MI with or without depression. Eighty Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were treated with saline and GFS (n=40 per group). The animals were then randomly divided into four subgroups: sham, MI, depression, and MI + depression (n=10 per subgroup). Protein levels of 5-HT and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R in the serum, platelets and brain tissues were determined with ELISA. The results demonstrated that serum 5-HT levels was significantly increased by GFS pretreatment in all subgroups (except the sham subgroup) when compared with saline-treated counterparts (p<0.01). In platelets, GFS pretreatment significantly increased 5-HT levels in all subgroups when compared with their respective saline-treated counterparts (p<0.01). Brain 5-HT levels also declined with GFS pretreatment in the MI-only and depression-only subgroups (p<0.05 <i>vs.</i> saline pretreatment). With respect to 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R levels, platelet 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R was decreased in GFS pretreated MI, depression and MI + depression subgroups (p<0.01 <i>vs.</i> saline pretreatment). Similarly, brain 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R levels decreased in all four subgroups pretreated with GFS (p<0.01 <i>vs.</i> saline pretreatment). We conclude that GFS plays a clear role in modulating 5-HT and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R expressions after MI and depression. Although the effects of GFS on brain 5-HT remain to be elucidated, its therapeutic potential for comorbidities of acute cardiovascular events and depression appears to hold much promise.",

    "abstract": "Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a significant clinical issue. Aging is a risk factor for POCD. It is known that not every patient develops POCD. This situation shall be similar in animals. Determination of POCD is individual-based in humans but group-based in animal studies. This difference prevents effective evaluation of biomarkers and interventions for POCD in preclinical studies. The objective of this study was to determine whether individual animal could be assessed for POCD by a system similar to that for patients. Seven-week old CD1 and 18-month old C57BL/6 male mice were subjected to right carotid arterial exposure under isoflurane anesthesia. Mice were evaluated by Barnes maze and fear conditioning either post-surgery alone or both prior to surgery and post-surgery. Surgery increased the time to identify the target box in Barnes maze when tested one day or 8 days after the training sessions and reduced freezing behavior in fear conditioning test. This phenomenon occurred in 7-week old animals with and without evaluation before the surgery and in 18-month old mice evaluated before and after surgery. Based on the method and criteria used for a human whose cognition was evaluated before and after surgery to assess individual decline of cognition, 7 in 21 mice in the surgical group and 1 in 21 mice in control group of 7-week old mice had cognitive dysfunction. Among 18-month old mice, 13 in 21 mice in the surgical group and 2 in 20 mice in the control group had cognitive dysfunction. The incidence of cognitive dysfunction in mice with surgery was higher than that in control mice no matter whether young adult (P = 0.045) or old mice (P < 0.001) were considered. These results indicate that surgery induces POCD in mice. Individual animal-based assessment can be used to identify animals with POCD.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 is an evolving pandemic that has far reaching global effects, with a combination of factors that makes the virus difficult to contain. The symptoms of infection can be devastating or at the least very debilitating for vulnerable individuals. It is clear that the elderly are at most risk of the adverse impacts of the virus, including hospitalization and death. Others at risk are those with comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease and metabolic conditions and those with a hyper-excitable immune response. Treatment options for those with acute responses to the virus are limited and there is an urgent need for potential strategies that can mitigate these severe effects. One potential avenue for treatment that has not been explored is the microbiome gut/lung axis. In addition to those severely affected by their acute reaction to the virus, there is also a need for treatment options for those that are slow to recover from the effects of the infection and also those who have been adversely affected by the measures put in place to arrest the spread of the virus. One potential treatment option is photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy. PBM has been shown over many years to be a safe, effective, non-invasive and easily deployed adjunctive treatment option for inflammatory conditions, pain, tissue healing and cellular energy. We have also recently demonstrated the effectiveness of PBM to alter the gut microbiome. PBM therapy is worthy of consideration as a potential treatment for those most vulnerable to COVID-19, such as the elderly and those with comorbidities. The treatment may potentially be advantageous for those infected with the virus, those who have a slow recovery from the effects of the virus and those who have been denied their normal exercise/rehabilitation programs due to the isolation restrictions that have been imposed to control the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "To describe the rationale, design and methodology of a geographically-representative and population-based study investigating the epidemiology, impact, personal and economic burden of age-related eye diseases, declining visual and other sensory systems in Asians aged >60 years in Singapore.PIONEER (The PopulatION HEalth and Eye Disease PRofilE in Elderly Singaporeans Study) is currently a cross-sectional study targeting 3152 Chinese, Malay and Indian adults who are Singapore citizens or permanent residents aged 60 years and older living across Singapore. The study is intended to be longitudinal, with several waves of data planned to be collected in the future. The sampling frame consisted of 7000 names derived from age, gender and ethnicity-stratified random sampling of individuals >60 years. Selected individuals were invited via letters, home visits, and telephone calls for a clinical assessment at the Singapore Eye Research Institute. Individuals with limited mobility were examined in a custom-designed mobile eye clinic. Questionnaires were subsequently administered at participants’ homes by trained interviewers in their preferred language. A total of 3,299 participants (from East, West, North and South Singapore) were approached from December 2017 to November 2019. Of these, 953 (28.5%) were deemed ineligible. Out of 2,346 eligible participants, 904 (38.5%) refused, and 1,442 (61.5%) attended our clinical testing protocol, giving an initial response rate of 61.5%. Of these, 1,170 (81%) were cognitively able to complete the questionnaire assessment. The mean age±SD of our participants was 73.8±8.6 years; n=798 (55.3%) were female; and 828 (57.4%) were of Chinese ethnicity. The findings from this study will allow a deeper understanding of the risk factors and impact of aging in Asian populations, particularly in relation to the visual function and other functional system.",

Information and telecommunication technologies can provide a low-cost method for managing frailty more proactively. This study aims to examine the range and extent of information and telecommunication technologies for managing frailty in older adults, their technology readiness level, the evidence, and the associated outcomes. A systematic literature review was conducted. Four databases were searched for studies: Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Web of Science. In total, we included 19 studies (out of 9,930) for the data abstraction. Overall, our findings indicate that (1) the proposed frailty phenotype is the most common ground truth to be used for assessing frailty; (2) the most common uses of information and telecommunication technologies for managing frailty are detection, and monitoring and detection, while interventional studies on frailty are very rare; (3) the five main types of information and telecommunication technologies for managing frailty in older adults are information and telecommunication technology-based platforms, smartphones, telemonitoring (home monitoring), wearable sensors and devices (commercial off-the-shelf), and multimedia formats for online access; (4) the technology readiness level of information and telecommunication technologies for managing frailty in older adults is the \"Technology Demonstration\" level, i.e., not yet ready to be operated in an actual operating environment; and (5) the level of evidence is still low for information and telecommunication technology studies that manage frailty in older adults. In conclusion, information and telecommunication technologies for managing frailty in the older adult population are not yet ready to be full-fledged technologies for this purpose.",

Studies using heterochronic parabiosis models further reinforced the hypothesis that juvenile factors can rejuvenate aged systems.

We discovered that pre-pubertal (young) mice subjected to hemorrhagic shock survived for a prolonged period, in the absence of fluid resuscitation, compared to mature or aged mice. To further understand the mechanism of maturational dependence of injury resolution, extracellular vesicles isolated from the plasma of young mice were administered to aged mice subjected to hemorrhagic shock. The extracellular vesicle treatment prolonged life in the aged mice. The treatment resulted in reduced oxidative stress in the liver and in the circulation, along with an enhanced expression of the nuclear factor erythroid factor 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its target genes, and a reduction in the expression of the transcription factor BTB and CNC homology 1 (Bach1). We propose that plasma factors in the juvenile mice have a reparative effect in the aged mice in injury resolution by modulating the Nrf2/Bach1 axis in the antioxidant response pathway.",

    "abstract": "Aging modifies risk in all cancers, but age is used as a clinical staging criterion uniquely in thyroid cancer (TC). The molecular drivers of age-dependent TC onset and aggressiveness remain poorly understood. We applied an integrative, multi-omics data analysis approach to characterize these signatures. Our analysis reveals that aging, independent of BRAFV600E mutational status, drives a significant accumulation of aggressiveness-related markers and poorer survival outcomes, most noticeably at age 55 and over. We identified that chromosomal alterations in loci 1p/1q as aging-associated drivers of aggressiveness, and that depleted infiltration with tumor surveillant CD8+T and follicular helper T cells, dysregulation of proteostasis- and senescence-related processes, and ERK1/2 signaling cascade are key features of the aging thyroid and TC onset/progression and aggressiveness in aging patients but not in young individuals. A panel of 23 genes, including those related to cell division such as CENPF, ERCC6L, and the kinases MELK and NEK2, were identified and rigorously characterized as aging-dependent and aggressiveness-specific markers. These genes effectively stratified patients into aggressive clusters with distinct phenotypic enrichment and genomic/transcriptomic profiles. This panel also showed excellent performance in predicting metastasis stage, BRAFV600E, TERT promoter mutation, and survival outcomes and was superior to the American Thyroid Association (ATA) methodology in predicting aggressiveness risk. Our analysis established clinically relevant biomarkers for TC aggressiveness factoring in aging as an important component.",

Quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) can be used to examine the nonmotor symptoms. This study aimed to characterize the patterns of QEEG and functional connectivity (FC) that differentiate PD from PSP or MSA, and explore the correlation between the differential QEEG indices and nonmotor dysfunctions in PD and AP. We enrolled 52 patients with PD, 31 with MSA, 22 with PSP, and 50 age-matched health controls to compare QEEG indices among specific brain regions. One-way analysis of variance was applied to assess QEEG indices between groups; Spearman's correlations were used to examine the relationship between QEEG indices and nonmotor symptoms scale (NMSS) and mini-mental state examination (MMSE). FCs using weighted phase lag index were compared between patients with PD and those with MSA/PSP. Patients with PSP revealed higher scores on the NMSS and lower MMSE scores than those with PD and MSA, with similar disease duration. The delta and theta powers revealed a significant increase in PSP, followed by PD and MSA. Patients with PD presented a significantly lower slow-to-fast ratio than those with PSP in the frontal region, while patients with PD presented significantly higher EEG-slowing indices than patients with MSA. The frontal slow-to-fast ratio showed a negative correlation with MMSE scores in patients with PD and PSP, and a positive correlation with NMSS in the perception and mood domain in patients with PSP but not in those with PD. Compared to PD, MSA presented enhanced FC in theta and delta bands in the posterior region, while PSP revealed decreased FC in the delta band within the frontal-temporal cortex. These findings suggest that QEEG might be a useful tool for evaluating the nonmotor dysfunctions in PD and AP. Our QEEG results suggested that with similar disease duration, the cortical neurodegenerative process was likely exacerbated in patients with PSP, followed by those with PD, and lastly in patients with MSA.",

    "abstract": "Aging is accompanied by physical dysfunction and physiologic degeneration that occurs over an individual’s lifetime. Human teeth, like many other organs, inevitably undergo chronological aging and age-related changes throughout the lifespan, resulting in a substantial need for preventive, restorative as well as periodontal dental care. This is particularly the case for seniors at 65 years of age and those older but economically disadvantaged. Dental aging not only interferes with normal chewing and digestion, but also affects daily appearance and interpersonal communications. Further dental aging can incur the case of multiple disorders such as oral cancer, encephalitis, and other systemic diseases. In the next decades or even hundreds of years, the proportion of the elderly in the global population will continue to rise, a tendency that attracts increasing attention across multiple scientific and medical disciplines. Dental aging will bring a variety of problems to the elderly themselves and poses serious challenges to the medical profession and social system. A reduced, but functional dentition comprising 20 teeth in occlusion has been proposed as a measurement index of successful dental aging. Healthy dental aging is critical to healthy aging, from both medical and social perspectives. To date, biomedical research on the causes, processes and regulatory mechanisms of dental aging is still in its infancy. In this article, updated insights into typical manifestations, associated pathologies, preventive strategies and molecular changes of dental aging are provided, with future research directions largely projected.",

In the present study we assessed the role of miR-200c on injury, Sirt1, and bioenergetic and neuroinflammatory markers in aged male and female mice after experimental stroke. Mice were subjected to 1hr of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and assessed for post-injury expression of miR-200c, Sirt1 protein and mRNA, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylated Sirt1 mRNA, ATP, cytochrome C oxidase activity, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin-6 (IL-6), infarct volume and motor function. MCAO induced a decrease in Sirt1 expression at 1d post-injury only in males. No differences in SIRT1 mRNA were observed between the sexes. Females had greater baseline miR-200c expression and a greater increase in miR-200c in response to stroke, while pre-MCAO levels of m6A SIRT1 was greater in females. Males had lower post-MCAO ATP levels and cytochrome C oxidase activity, and higher TNFα and IL-6. Post-injury intravenous treatment with anti-miR-200c reduced miR-200c expression in both sexes. In males, anti-miR-200c increased Sirt1 protein expression, reduced infarct volume, and improved neurological score. Conversely in females anti-miR-200c had no effect on Sirt1 levels and provided no protection against injury from MCAO. These results provide the first evidence of sexual dimorphism in the role of a microRNA in aged mice after experimental stroke and suggest sex-differences in epigenetic modulation of the transcriptome and downstream effects on miR biological activity may play a role in sexually dimorphic outcomes after stroke in aged brains.",

    "abstract": "Chronic hypertension is a major risk factor for cognitive impairment, which can promote neuroinflammation and neuronal loss in the central nervous system. Transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is a key molecular component in determining cell fate and can be activated by inflammatory cytokines. This study aimed to investigate the role of TAK1 in mediating neuronal survival in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus under chronic hypertensive conditions. To that end, we used stroke-prone renovascular hypertension rats (RHRSP) as chronic hypertension models. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) designed to overexpress or knock down TAK1 expression were injected into the lateral ventricles of rats and the subsequent effects on cognitive function and neuronal survival under chronic hypertensive conditions were assessed. We found that, TAK1 knockdown in RHRSP markedly increased neuronal apoptosis and necroptosis and induced cognitive impairment, which could be reversed by Nec-1s, an inhibitor of receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1). In contrast, overexpression of TAK1 in RHRSP significantly suppressed neuronal apoptosis and necroptosis and improved cognitive function. Further knockdown of TAK1 in sham-operated rats received similar phenotype with RHRSP. The results have been verified in vitro. In this study, we provide in vivo and in vitro evidence that TAK1 improves cognitive function by suppressing RIPK1-driven neuronal apoptosis and necroptosis in rats with chronic hypertension.",

PARP16, a Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, is a known tail-anchored endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane protein that transduces ER stress during pathological processes. Here, we found that PARP16 was significantly increased in the hippocampi and cortices of APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice and hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells exposed to Aβ, suggesting a positive correlation between the progression of AD pathology and the overexpression of PARP16. To define the effect of PARP16 on AD progression, adeno-associated virus mediated-PARP16 knockdown was used in APP/PS1 mice to investigate the role of PARP16 in spatial memory, amyloid burden, and neuroinflammation. Knockdown of PARP16 partly attenuated impaired spatial memory, as indicated by the Morris water maze test, and decreased amyloid deposition, neuronal apoptosis, and the production of inflammatory cytokines in the brains of APP/PS1 mice. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the knockdown of PARP16 expression rescued neuronal damage and ER stress triggered by Aβ. Furthermore, we discovered that intracellular PARP16 acts as an RNA-binding protein that regulates the mRNA stability of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and protects targeted APP from degradation, thereby increasing APP levels and AD pathology. Our findings revealed an unanticipated role of PARP16 in the pathogenesis of AD, and at least in part, its association with increased APP mRNA stability.",

    "abstract": "Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) are beneficial microorganisms widely utilized in food fermentation processes and as probiotic supplements. They offer multifarious health benefits, including enhancing digestion, strengthening immune mechanisms, and mitigating inflammation. Recent studies suggest that LAB might be instrumental in the anti-aging domain, modulating key molecular pathways involved in the aging continuum, such as IL-13, TNF-α, mTOR, IFN-γ, TGF-β, AMPK, and GABA. The TLR family, particularly TLR2, appears pivotal during the primary cellular interactions with bacteria and their byproducts. Concurrently, the Sirtuin family, predominantly Sirtuin-1, plays diverse roles upon cellular stimuli by bacterial components. The potential anti-aging benefits postulated include restoring gut balance, enhancing antioxidant potential, and fortifying cognitive and mental faculties. However, the current body of evidence is still embryonic and calls for expansive human trials and deeper mechanistic analyses. The safety and optimal consumption metrics for LAB also warrant rigorous evaluation. Future research trajectories should identify specific LAB strains with potent anti-aging properties and unravel the underlying biological pathways. Given the promising implications, LAB strains stand as potential dietary contenders to foster healthy aging and enrich the quality of life among the elderly population.",

    "abstract": "Stroke survivors are typically left with structural brain damage and associated functional impairment in the chronic phase of injury, for which few therapeutic options exist. We reported previously that transplantation of human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived neural stem cells together with Matrigel scaffolding into the brains of rats after focal ischemia reduced infarct volume and improved neurobehavioral performance. Matrigel is a gelatinous protein mixture extracted from mouse sarcoma cells, thus would not be approved for use as a scaffold clinically. In this study, we generated a gel-like scaffold from plasma that was controlled by changing the concentration of CaCl<sub>2</sub>. <i>In vitro</i> study confirmed that 10-20 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 10-40% plasma did not affect the viability and proliferation of human and rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (BMSCs) and neural stem cells (NSCs). We transplanted plasma scaffold in combination of BMSCs into the cystic cavity after focal cerebral ischemia, and found that the atrophy volume was dramatically reduced and motor function was significantly improved in the group transplanted with scaffold/BMSCs compared with the groups treated with vehicle, scaffold or BMSCs only. Our data suggest that plasma-derived scaffold in combination of BMSCs is feasible for tissue engineering approach for the stroke treatment.",

    "abstract": "Compelling evidence indicates that factors in the blood can profoundly reverse aging-related impairments, as exposure of aged mice to young blood rejuvenates adult stem cell function, improves cognition, and ameliorates cardiac hypertrophy. Systemic factors from mice can also extend the life span of a partner exposed to a lethal treatment or disease. These findings suggest that the systemic milieu of a healthy young partner may be beneficial for an aged organism. However, it is unknown whether a healthy young systemic milieu can improve functional recovery after ischemic stroke. Intraperitoneal administration of young plasma into aged rats after ischemic stroke induced by distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) reduced infarct volume and motor impairment, compared with vehicle group. On the contrary, intraperitoneal administration of plasma from aged rats into young ischemic rats worsened brain injury and motor deficits. Using a proteomic approach, we found that haptoglobin levels were significantly increased in serum of aged rats and that intraperitoneal administration of haptoglobin impaired outcome after ischemic stroke in young rats. Our data suggest that the aging systemic milieu plays a critical role in functional outcome after ischemic stroke.",

We grouped women by menopausal age as follows: ≤ 48 years (earlier menopause), ≥ 52 years (later menopause), and 48-52 years (control). The DNA methylation levels of Alu and LINE-1 were measured by MethyLight PCR. The results showed that the DNA methylation levels of both Alu and LINE-1 were inversely correlated with menopausal age in the plasma DNA cohort (r = 0.079, <i>P</i> < 0.001 for Alu; r = 0.045, <i>P</i> = 0.007 for LINE-1) as well as in the serum DNA cohort (r = 0.087, <i>P</i> = 0.001 for Alu; r = 0.041, <i>P</i> = 0.026 for LINE-1). Alu methylation levels in both the plasma and serum DNA cohorts and LINE-1 methylation levels in the plasma cohort were remarkably higher in the earlier menopause group than in the later menopause and control groups (<i>P</i> < 0.01 and <i>P</i> < 0.05, respectively). In the serum DNA cohort, the LINE-1 methylation levels in the later menopause group were significantly lower than that in the earlier menopause group and control group (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Therefore, methylation levels of Alu and LINE-1 were significantly associated with menopausal age. Women with earlier menopause showed hypermethylation in both repetitive elements, while women with later menopause showed hypomethylation. These findings suggest that altered DNA methylation in leukocytes and serum cell-free DNA may represent a biomarker of menopausal age.",

The existing VSRAD is based on the normal database with 1.5-tesla MRI scans (VSRAD-1.5T), and its utility for patients have undergone 3-tesla MRI is still controversial. We recruited 19 patients with early AD and 28 healthy controls who had undergone 3-tesla MRI scans at our institute (Cohort 1). We also used the 3-tesla MRI data of 30 patients with early AD and 13 healthy controls from the Japanese Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (Cohort 2). We also created a new VSRAD based on 65 normal subjects' 3-tesla MRI scans (VSRAD-3T), and compared the detectability of AD between VSRAD-1.5T and VSRAD-3T, using receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the curve (AUC) analyses. As a result, there were no significant differences in the detectability of AD between VSRAD-3T and VSRAD-1.5T, except for the whole white matter atrophy score, which showed significantly better AUC in VSRAD-3T than in VSRAD-1.5T in both Cohort 1 (p=0.04) and 2 (p<0.01). Generally, there were better diagnostic values in Cohort 2 than in Cohort 1. The optimal cutoff values varied but were generally lower than in the previously published data. In conclusion, for patients with 3-tesla MRI, the detectability of early AD by the existing VSRAD was not different from that by the new VSRAD based on 3-tesla database. We should exercise caution when using the existing VSRAD for 3-tesla white matter analyses or for setting cutoff values.",

Considering each domain and question, internal consistency and reliability were analyzed through the Crombach alpha (α) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI). A very good internal consistency was shown for the 3 domains: concern and pain showed a Cronbach of 0.896, footwear and general foot health of 0.790, mobility 0.887. Each question had a very good test-retest reliability, ranged from 0.721 to 0.963 with no systematic differences (P>0.05) in each question of the Spanish Bristol Foot Score (BFS-S) questionnaire. The test-retest reliability was excellent (ICC 95%): concern and foot pain 0.950 (0.913-0971); footwear and general foot health 0.914 (0.851-0.950), mobility 0.973 (0.953-0.984) and there were no sistematic differences in any domain (P > 0.05).

    "abstract": "Sepsis is a severe disease frequently occurred in the Intenisive Care Unit (ICU), which has a very high morbidity and mortality, especially in patients aged over 65 years. Owing to the aging effect and the ensuing deterioration of body function, the elder patients may have atypical responses to sepsis. Diagnosis and pathogenesis of sepsis in this population are thus difficult, which hindered effective treatment and management in clinic. To investigated age effects on sepsis, 158 elderly septic patients and 71 non-septic elderly participants were enrolled, and their plasma samples were collected for transcriptomics (RNA-seq) and metabolomics (NMR and GC-MS) analyses, which are both increasingly being utilized to discover key molecular changes and potential biomarkers for various diseases. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis was subsequently performed to assist cross-platform integration. Real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used for validation of RNA-seq results. For further understanding of the mechanisms, cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) experiment was performed both in young and middle-aged rats, which were subjected to NMR-based metabolomics study and validated for several key inflammation pathways by western blot. Comprehensive analysis of data from the two omics approaches provides a systematic perspective on dysregulated pathways that could facilitate the development of therapy and biomarkers for elderly sepsis. Additionally, the metabolites of lactate, arginine, histamine, tyrosine, glutamate and glucose were shown to be highly specific and sensitive in distinguishing septic patients from healthy controls. Significant increases of arginine, trimethylamine N-oxide and allantoin characterized elderly patient incurred sepsis. Further analytical and biological validations in different subpopulations of septic patients should be carried out, allowing accurate diagnostics and precise treatment of sepsis in clinic.",

Here, the models of 1 h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)/1-7 d reperfusion (R)-induced ischemic stroke and in vitro cell ischemia of 1 h oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)/24 h reoxygenation in primary cultured cortical neurons were used to explore GAL's effects and its underlying mechanisms. The results showed significant increases of GAL protein levels in the peri-infarct region (P) and infarct core (I) within 48 h R of MCAO mice (p<0.001). The RT-qPCR results also demonstrated significant increases of GAL mRNA during 24-48 h R (p<0.001), and GAL receptors GalR1-2 (but not 3) mRNA levels in the P region at 24 h R of MCAO mice (p<0.001). Furthermore, the significant decrease of infarct volume (p<0.05) and improved neurological outcome (p<0.001-0.05) were observed in MCAO mice following 1 h pre- or 6 h post-treatment of GAL during 1-7 d reperfusion. GalR1 was confirmed as the receptor responsible for GAL-induced neuroprotection by using GalR2/3 agonist AR-M1896 and Lentivirus-based RNAi knockdown of GalR1. GAL treatment inhibited Caspase-3 activation through the upstream initiators Capsases-8/-12 (not Caspase-9) in both P region and OGD-treated cortical neurons. Meanwhile, GAL's neuroprotective effect was not observed in cortical neurons from conventional protein kinase C (cPKC) γ knockout mice. These results suggested that exogenous GAL protects the brain from ischemic injury by inhibiting Capsase-8/12-initiated apoptosis, possibly mediated by GalR1 via the cPKCγ signaling pathway.",

This review focuses on the value of a multidimensional approach in the study of the aging airways, including clinical findings, respiratory function tests, and imaging as parts of a whole. Nowadays this multidimensional diagnostic approach can be used in daily clinical practice.

There are no studies that investigated the predictive properties of urinary (u) NGAL as an AKI marker in septic elderly population. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of uNGAL as predictor of AKI diagnosis and prognosis in elderly septic patients admitted to ICUs. We prospectively studied elderly patients with sepsis admitted to ICUs from October 2014 to November 2015. Assessment of renal function was performed daily by serum creatinine and urine output. The level of uNGAL was performed within the first 48 hours of the diagnosis of sepsis (NGAL1) and between 48 and 96 hours (NGAL2). The results were presented using descriptive statistics and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and p value was 5%. Seventy-five patients were included, 47 (62.7%) developed AKI. At logistic regression, chronic kidney disease and low mean blood pressure at admission were identified as factors associated with AKI (OR=0.05, CI=0.01-0.60, p=0.045 and OR=0.81, CI=0,13-0.47; p=0.047). The uNGAL was excellent predictor of AKI diagnosis (AUC-ROC >0.95, and sensitivity and specificity>0.89), anticipating the AKI diagnosis in 2.1±0.3 days. Factors associated with mortality in the logistic regression were presence of AKI (OR=2.14, CI=1.42-3.98, p=0.04), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 9.37, CI =1.79-49.1, p=0.008) and vasoactive drugs (OR=2.06, CI=0.98-1.02, p=0.04). The accuracy of NGALu 1 and 2 as predictors of death was intermediate, with AUC-ROC of 0.61 and 0.62; sensitivity between 0.65 and 0.77 and specificity lower than 0.6.

However, previous studies may have underestimated ROM of dementia due to length bias, which occurs when failing to include the persons with rapidly progressive diseases, who died before they could be included in the study. This population-based prospective cohort study conducted on 6,752 randomly sampled Koreans, aged 60 years or older (the Korean Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Aging and Dementia). Cognitive disorders were evaluated at baseline and 2-year follow-up using the Korean version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Packet (CERAD-K), and prevalent and incident cases of dementia were identified. The participants' deaths were confirmed through the National Mortality Database of Statistics Korea. We compared the ROM between prevalent and incident dementia, and estimated HR of dementia for mortality using Cox proportional hazards model. Of the 5,097 responders to the 2-year follow-up assessment, 150 participants had dementia from the baseline (prevalent dementia), and 95 participants developed dementia during the 2-year follow-up period (incident dementia). The ROM of participants with incident dementia was about 3 times higher than the ROM of those with prevalent dementia (HR = 3.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.34-6.91). Compared to cognitively normal participants at both the baseline and 2-year follow-up assessments, the ROM of those with incident dementia approximately 8 times higher (HR = 8.37, 95 % CI = 4.23-16.54). In conclusion, the ROM of dementia using prevalent cases was underestimated due to length bias, and dementia may be much more fatal than previously estimated. In clinical settings, the ROM of dementia warrants the attention of physicians, particularly in recently incident dementia cases.",

    "abstract": "Leukoaraiosis (LA) is frequently found in ischemic stroke patients, especially when those patients have intracranial atherosclerosis (ICAS). However, previous studies regarding an association of LA with cerebral large artery atherosclerosis showed conflicting results, and the relationship of LA with ICAS is uncertain. This study aimed to explore the association between LA and cerebral large artery atherosclerosis in Chinese patients with cerebral ischemia. Data were derived from the Chinese Intracranial Atherosclerosis (CICAS) study. Patients diagnosed with an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 7 days of symptom onset were included. The analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) focused on severity of LA in periventricular and deep white matter; type of cerebral large artery stenosis; and the number, severity, and distribution of ICAS lesions. ICAS was defined as an occlusion or more than 50% stenosis of intracranial vessels on magnetic resonance angiography. Among 2420 patients included, distinct LA was observed in 898 (37.11%) patients, and the rate of LA increased significantly with an increased number of risk factors. Multivariate analysis revealed that LA was independently associated with ICAS (odds ratio [OR], 1.388; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.132-1.702; P=0.0016). In the subgroup analysis of ICAS, LA was more frequently observed in multiple lesions (OR, 1.342; 95% CI, 1.060-1.699; P=0.0146), occlusive lesions (OR, 1.554; 95% CI, 1.214-1.998; P=0.0005), and lesions in the posterior circulation (OR, 1.360; 95% CI, 1.003-1.846; P=0.0481). In this nationwide prospective study, LA was associated with symptomatic ICAS, patients with multiple ICAS lesions, occlusive lesions, and atherosclerotic lesions in the posterior circulation were more likely to coexist with LA.",

In China, HD is considered to have a low prevalence. The goal of this study was to describe the clinical characteristic and genetic profiles of HD in a Chinese cohort. A total of 322 individuals with expanded CAG repeats were consecutively recruited from the neurologic clinics of three medical centers in Southeastern China between 2008 and 2018. Among them, 80 were pre-symptomatic mutation carriers and 242 were symptomatic patients. The mean age at onset (AAO), defined here as the age at motor symptom onset, of the 242 manifest HD individuals was 40.3 ± 11.9 years and the mean CAG repeat length was 46.1 ± 7.5 in the group of symptomatic patients. Initial symptoms were abnormal movements in 88.8% of the patients with psychiatric symptoms in 6.2%, cognitive impairment in 3.3% and others in 1.7%. The AAO of motor was negatively correlated with the CAG repeat length in an exponential regression analysis (R 2 = 0.74, P<0.001). Analysis of 46 parent-child pairs showed that the CAG repeat length was longer in the offspring group (45.8 ±7.6) than in the parent group (43.8 ±3.0) (p=0.005).

    "abstract": "Aging is associated with increased fat mass and elevated serum leptin levels (hyperleptinemia), causing proinflammation in the kidneys where it plays a primary role in the removal of endogenous leptin from the circulation. Lymphocyte-specific kinase (Lck) is a positive regulator of inflammatory signaling and a potential treatment target for age-related diseases, but its role in leptin signaling is unknown. Here, we investigated how Lck influences hyperleptinemia-induced inflammation in kidney tissues from 6- and 21-month-old rats. Results indicate that Lck expression and activation increased significantly in aged rat kidneys, especially at renal tubules. Furthermore, we identified interactions between Lck and short leptin-receptor isoforms, suggesting that Lck is a protein tyrosine kinase regulating leptin signaling. We further investigated whether increased Lck expression in renal tubular epithelial cells and macrophage infiltration are associated with leptin-induced inflammation. We then demonstrated that leptin activates Lck and proinflammatory transcription factors (STAT3 and NF-κB), while Lck knockdown modulates the expression of both transcription factors. Collectively, these data implicate that Lck leads to development of leptin-induced renal inflammation during aging. Inhibition of this protein tyrosine kinase may therefore be an appropriate therapeutic option for protection against age-related hyperleptinemia.",

    "abstract": "Total body irradiation (TBI) serves as an effectively curative therapy for cancer patients and adversely causes long-term residual bone marrow (BM) injury with premature senescence of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which is mediated by increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the present study, we investigated how the exposure time of TBI in a mouse model affects HSCs and whether the treatment of caffeic acid (CA), a known dietary phenolic antioxidant, has a radioprotective effect. Single (S)-TBI at a sublethal dose (5 Gy) caused relatively higher induction of mitochondrial ROS and senescence-related factors in HSCs than those in hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and Lineage-Sca-1+c-Kit+ (LSK) cells, as well as reduced clonogenic formation and donor cell-derived reconstituting capacity. Repetitive double (D)-TBI (two months after the S-TBI at a dose of 5Gy) further weakened HSPC function via mitochondrial ROS accumulation and senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity. Oral administration of CA (20 mg/kg) five times before and once immediately after TBI ameliorated ROS generation and TBI-induced HSC senescence and its radioprotective effect was long lasting in S-TBI mice but not in D-TBI mice. Further, supplementation of CA also induced apoptotic cell death of colon cancer cells. Collectively, these findings indicate that CA has a dual effect, ameliorating HSC senescence-accompanied long-term BM injury in S-TBI mice and stimulating apoptotic cell death of colon cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Along with thrombolytic therapy, which has a number of limitations, stroke outcome may be improved with neuroprotective therapies that disrupt ischemic cell death. Recent research has shown a neuroprotective role of ethanol administration during ischemic stroke, such as its ability to reduce infarct volume and neurologic deficit. In order to investigate this further, we assessed the hypothesis that ethanol's neuroprotective effect is through reduction of apoptosis and the modulation of the important apoptotic PKC-δ and Akt signaling pathway. Ethanol (1.5 g/kg) was given by intraperitoneal injections to 54 Sprague-Dawley rats after 2 hours of middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion, followed by 3 or 24 hours of reperfusion. We measured apoptotic cell death, PKC-δ, and Akt mRNA and protein expressions in each of ischemic groups with or without ethanol treatment using ELISA, real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. Our results showed that cell death was significantly increased in rats following 2 hour MCA occlusion and 24 hour reperfusion. Subsequently, cell death was significantly reduced by an administration of ethanol. We further found that ethanol administration, prior to either 3 or 24 hours of reperfusion, significantly decreased the expression of PKC-δ while simultaneously increasing the expression Akt at both mRNA and protein levels at the two points. In conclusion, our study suggests that ethanol administration following ischemic stroke modulates the gene and protein profile in such a way that it increased expression of anti-apoptotic Akt and decreased the pro-apoptotic PKC-δ. This ultimately results in a decrease in neuronal apoptosis, thus conferring neuroprotection.",

There is therefore an overwhelming need to understand the mechanism of cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer, that is, ovarian cancer cells are insensitive to cisplatin treatment. Here, we show that failure of elevating calcium and oxidative stress tolerance play key roles in cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cell lines. Cisplatin induces an increase in oxidative stress and alters intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, including cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> in cisplatin-sensitive SKOV3 cells, but not in cisplatin-resistant SKOV3/DDP cells. Cisplatin induces mitochondrial damage and triggers the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in cisplatin-sensitive SKOV3 cells, but rarely in cisplatin-resistant SKOV3/DDP cells. Inhibition of calcium signaling attenuates cisplatin-induced oxidative stress and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload in cisplatin-sensitive SKOV3 cells. Moreover, <i>in vivo</i> xenograft models of nude mouse, cisplatin significantly reduced the growth rates of tumors originating from SKOV3 cells, but not that of SKOV3/DDP cells. Collectively, our data indicate that failure of calcium up-regulation mediates cisplatin resistance by alleviating oxidative stress in ovarian cancer cells. Our results highlight potential therapeutic strategies to improve cisplatin resistance.",

    "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent arrhythmia in the world, due both to its tenacious treatment resistance, and to the tremendous number of risk factors that set the stage for the atria to fibrillate. Cardiopulmonary, behavioral, and psychological risk factors generate electrical and structural alterations of the atria that promote reentry and wavebreak. These culminate in fibrillation once atrial ectopic beats set the arrhythmia process in motion. There is growing evidence that chronic stress can physically alter the emotion centers of the limbic system, changing their input to the hypothalamic-limbic-autonomic network that regulates autonomic outflow. This leads to imbalance of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems, most often in favor of sympathetic overactivation. Autonomic imbalance acts as a driving force behind the atrial ectopy and reentry that promote AF. Careful study of AF pathophysiology can illuminate the means that enable AF to elude both pharmacological control and surgical cure, by revealing ways in which antiarrhythmic drugs and surgical and ablation procedures may paradoxically promote fibrillation. Understanding AF pathophysiology can also help clarify the mechanisms by which emerging modalities aiming to correct autonomic imbalance, such as renal sympathetic denervation, may offer potential to better control this arrhythmia. Finally, growing evidence supports lifestyle modification approaches as adjuncts to improve AF control.",

However, glycosylation and glycome analysis is a significantly challenging task. Although several lines of evidence have indicated that protein glycosylation is defective in Alzheimer's disease (AD), only a few studies have focused on AD glycomics. The etiology of AD is unclear and there are no effective disease-modifying treatments for AD. In this study, we found that the object recognition memory, passive avoidance, and spatial learning and memory of senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) strain, an AD animal model, were deficient, and LW-AFC, which was prepared from the traditional Chinese medicine prescription Liuwei Dihuang decoction, showed beneficial effects on the deterioration of cognitive capability in SAMP8 mice. Forty-three and 56 N-glycan were identified in the cerebral cortex and serum of SAMP8 mice, respectively. The N-glycan profile in SAMP8 mice was significantly different from that of senescence accelerated mouse resistant 1 (SAMR1) strains, the control of SAMP8 mice. Treatment with LW-AFC modulated the abundance of 21 and 6 N-glycan in the cerebral cortex and serum of SAMP8 mice, respectively. The abundance of (Hex)3(HexNAc)5(Fuc)1(Neu5Ac)1 and (Hex)2(HexNAc)4 decreased in the cerebral cortex and serum of SAMP8 mice compared with SAMR1 mice, decreases that were significantly correlated with learning and memory measures. The administration of LW-AFC could reverse or increase these levels in SAMP8 mice. These results indicated that the effects of LW-AFC on cognitive impairments in SAMP8 mice might be through modulation of N-glycan patterns, and LW-AFC may be a potential anti-AD agent.",

    "abstract": "GABAergic neuronal cell grafting has promise for treating a multitude of neurological disorders including epilepsy, age-related memory dysfunction, Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. However, identification of an unlimited source of GABAergic cells is critical for advancing such therapies. Our previous study implied that reprogramming of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) through overexpression of the Achaete-scute homolog 1 (Ascl1, also called Mash1) could generate GABAergic neuron-like cells. Here, we investigated mechanisms underlying the conversion of BMSCs into GABAergic cells. We inhibited γ-secretase (an enzyme that activates Notch signaling) with N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) or manipulated the expression of Notch signaling components such as the recombination signal binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region (RBPJ), hairy and enhancer of split-1 (Hes1) or Mash1. We demonstrate that inhibition of γ-secretase through DAPT down-regulates RBPJ and Hes1, up-regulates Mash1 and results in an enhanced differentiation of BMSCs into GABAergic cells. On the other hand, RBPJ knockdown in BMSCs has no effect on Mash1 gene expression whereas Hes1 knockdown increases the expression of Mash1. Transduction of Mash1 in BMSCs also increases the expression of Hes1 but not RBPJ. Moreover, increased GABAergic differentiation in BMSCs occurs with concurrent Mash1 overexpression and Hes1-silencing. Thus, the Mash1-dependent Notch signaling pathway regulates GABAergic neuron-like differentiation of BMSCs. These results also suggest that genetic engineering of BMSCs is a useful avenue for obtaining GABAergic neuron-like donor cells for the treatment of neurological disorders.",

We previously reported that the most abundant member of a specific protein complex to bind across the presumed causal variant at this locus, rs7903146, was poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase type 1 (PARP-1). We analyzed the impact of PARP-1 inhibition on <i>C. elegans</i> health in the setting of hyperglycemia and on glucose-stimulated GLP-1 secretion in human intestinal cells. Given that high glucose concentrations progressively shorten the lifespan of <i>C. elegans</i>, in part by impacting key well-conserved insulin-modulated signaling pathways, we investigated the effect of PARP-1 inhibition with Olaparib on the lifespan of <i>C. elegans</i> nematodes under varying hyperglycemic conditions. Subsequently, we investigated whether Olaparib treatment had any effect on glucose-stimulated GLP-1 secretion in the human NCI-H716 intestinal cell line, a model system for the investigation of enteroendocrine function. Treatment with 100uM Olaparib in nematodes exposed to high concentrations of glucose led to significant lifespan rescue. The beneficial lifespan effect of Olaparib appeared to require both <i>PARP-1</i> and <i>TCF7L2</i>, since treatment had no effect in hyperglycemic conditions in knock-out worm strains for either of these homologs. Further investigation using the NCI-H716 cells revealed that Olaparib significantly enhanced secretion of the incretin, GLP-1, plus the gene expression of <i>TCF7L2</i>, <i>GCG</i> and <i>PC1</i>. These data from studies in both <i>C. elegans</i> and a human cell line suggest that PARP-1 inhibition offers a novel therapeutic avenue to treat type 2 diabetes.",

Various studies have correlated the presence of specific risk factors, in particular the chronic kidney disease, with the presence of calcification, but not with the type of calcification. Since it is likely that carotid nodular calcifications rather than those with non-nodular aspect may represent a plaque at high risk of rupture, the purpose of our study was to evaluate the role of nodular calcification in the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular syndromes and their possible correlation with specific risk factors. A total of 168 carotid plaques from symptomatic and asymptomatic patients submitted to endarterectomy, whom complete clinical and laboratory assessment of major cardiovascular risk factors was available, were studied. In 21 endarterectomies (5 from symptomatic and 16 from asymptomatic patients) an eruptive calcified nodule, consisting of calcified plates associated to a small amount of fibrous tissue without extracellular lipids and inflammatory cells, was found protruding into the lumen. Nodular calcifications were significantly observed in patients affected by chronic kidney disease (with GFR<60 ml / min / 1.73 m2), with a normal lipidic and glycemic profile. On the contrary, non-nodular calcification, mainly correlated to diabetes, were stable lesions. Results of our study suggest that the mechanisms and the clinical significance of carotid atherosclerotic calcification may be different. The nodular calcification could represent a type of unstable plaque, significantly related to chronic kidney disease, without inflammation, morphologically different from the classical vulnerable plaques.",

In this study, we identified Ascl2 as a downstream basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor in NSCs following exposure to TNFα. Under normal conditions, Ascl2 expression is inhibited at post-transcriptional levels by miR-26a, which targets the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of Ascl2. Upon exposure to TNFα, miR-26a expression is reduced, which leads to up-regulation of Ascl2. Overexpression of Ascl2 promotes neuronal differentiation, reduces proliferation, and increases the level of cleaved CASPASE 3 in NSCs, as observed in the in vitro and in ovo experiments. Ascl2 may serve in NSCs as a standby factor that readily responds to TNFα, which is often induced in inflammatory situations. In a chronic inflammatory condition with consistent up-regulation of TNFα, overexpression of Ascl2 may inhibit neurogenesis as a net result.",

However, the underlying mechanisms have not been clearly elucidated. Agonistic autoantibodies against angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor (AT1-AAs) have been demonstrated to be pro-inflammatory and contribute to the progression of atherosclerosis. However, the association between AT1-AAs and vascular aging has not been defined. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is an acknowledged vascular aging-related disease. In this study, AT1-AAs were detected in the sera of patients with PAD and the positive rate was 44.44% (n=63) <i>vs.</i> 17.46% in non-PAD volunteers (n=63). In addition, case-control analysis showed that AT1-AAs level was positively correlated with PAD. To reveal the causal relationship between AT1-AAs and vascular aging, an AT1-AAs-positive rat model was established by active immunization. The carotid pulse wave velocity was higher, and the aortic endothelium-dependent vasodilatation was attenuated significantly in the immunized rats. Morphological staining showed thickening of the aortic wall. Histological examination showed that levels of the senescent markers were increased in the aortic tissue, mostly located at the endothelium. In addition, purified AT1-AAs-IgGs from both the immunized rats and PAD patients induced premature senescence in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells. These effects were significantly blocked by the AT1 receptor blocker. Taken together, our study demonstrates that AT1-AAs contribute to the progression of vascular aging and induce EC senescence through AT1 receptor. AT1-AA is a novel biomarker of vascular aging and aging-related CVD that acts to accelerate EC senescence.",

The present study sought to investigate the correlations between the volume of WMH and medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) using quantitative magnetic resonance image (MRI) and a variety of executive function assessments. A total of 91 patients ranging in age from 58 to 90 years with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or early phase AD were recruited from the outpatient clinic at the Department of Neurology of Nagoya City University Hospital. We administered neuropsychological batteries evaluating verbal memory, orientation, spatial ability, sustained attention, and a variety of executive functions, including verbal fluency, flexibility, inhibition, and working memory. Quantitative MRI analyses were performed using Dr. View/Linux software and a voxel-based specific regional analysis system. Significant correlations were observed between WMH, as well as MTA, and some executive function scores. Regression analysis revealed that MTA was the strongest predictor of flexibility and verbal fluency. These findings provide new insight into the relationship between quantitative MRI analyses and various types of executive dysfunction in elderly people with MCI due to AD and/or early phase AD. When cognitive function is examined in elderly patients with MCI due to AD or early phase AD, it is important to consider the involvement of WMH and MTA, which is indicative of AD pathology in cognitive dysfunction, particularly executive function.",

Following the orthotopic implantation of 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells into aged ovariectomized (OVX) mice, we evaluated the effects of calcitriol and its two analogues, PRI-2191 and PRI-2205, on metastatic spread and bone homeostasis. Calcitriol and its analogues temporarily inhibited the formation of metastases in the lungs. Unexpectedly, only mice treated with calcitriol analogues showed a deterioration of bone-related parameters, such as bone column density, marrow column density and the CaPO4 coefficient. These findings correlated with an increased number of active osteoclasts differentiated from bone marrow-derived macrophages in mice treated with the analogues. Interestingly, in the tumours from mice treated with PRI-2191 and PRI-2205, the expression of Tnfsf11 (RANKL) was increased. On the other hand, osteopontin (OPN) levels in plasma and tumour tissue, as well as TRAC5b levels in tumours, were diminished by calcitriol and its analogues. Despite a similar action of both analogues towards bone metabolism, their impact on vitamin D metabolism differed. In particular, PRI-2191 and calcitriol, not PRI-2205 treatment significantly diminished the levels of both 25(OH)D3 and 24,25(OH)2D3. In conclusion, though there is evident antimetastatic activity in old OVX mice, signs of increased bone metabolism and deterioration of bone mineralization during therapy with calcitriol analogues were observed.",

    "abstract": "With advances in medical technology, the number of people over the age of 60 is on the rise, and thus, increasing the prevalence of age-related pathologies within the aging population. Neurodegenerative disorders, cancers, metabolic and inflammatory diseases are some of the most prevalent age-related pathologies affecting the growing population. It is imperative that a new treatment to combat these pathologies be developed. Although, still in its infancy, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has become a potent gene-editing tool capable of correcting gene-mediated age-related pathology, and therefore ameliorating or eliminating disease symptoms. Deleting target genes using the CRISPR-Cas9 system or correcting for gene mutations may ameliorate many different neurodegenerative disorders detected in the aging population. Cancer cells targeted by the CRISPR-Cas9 system may result in an increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutics, lower proliferation, and higher cancer cell death. Finally, reducing gene targeting inflammatory molecules production through microRNA knockout holds promise as a therapeutic strategy for both arthritis and inflammation. Here we present a review based on how the expanding world of genome editing can be applied to disorders and diseases affecting the aging population.",

    "abstract": "DICER1 deficiency in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) was associated with the accumulation of <i>Alu</i> transcripts and implicated in geographic atrophy (GA), a form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), an eye disease leading to blindness in millions of people. Although the exact mechanism of this association is not fully known, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, maturation of caspase-1 and disruption in mitochondrial homeostasis in RPE cells were shown as critical for it. DICER1 deficiency results in dysregulation of miRNAs and changes in the expression of many genes important for RPE homeostasis, which may also contribute to AMD. DICER1 deficiency can change the functions of the miR-183/96/182 cluster that regulates photoreceptors and their synaptic transmission. Aging, the main AMD risk factor, is associated with decreased expression of DICER1 and changes in its diurnal pattern that are not synchronized with circadian regulation in the retina. The initial insult inducing DICER1 deficiency in AMD may be oxidative stress, another major risk factor of AMD, but further studies on the role of deficient DICER1 in AMD pathogenesis and its therapeutic potential are needed.",

However, both trials showed only mild outcome. Retrospective analysis revealed several possible reasons that include patient selection, heterogeneity of grafts, immune recognition of grafts, lack of standardization of transplantation procedure and uneven distribution of grafts. Recent years have seen advances in reprogramming technologies which may provide solutions to the problems associated with fVM tissues. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and induced neural stem cells (iNSCs) hold promise for generating clinical grade DA neural cells that are safe, homogeneous, scalable and standardizable. These new technologies may bring back clinical trials using cell therapy for PD treatment in the future.",

Hyper-elevation of Interleukin1 (IL-1), Tumor necrosis factor-1alfa (TNF-1 alfa), and Interleukin 6 (IL-6) produced by inflammatory macrophage M1 may damage the lung alveoli leading to severe pneumonitis, decreased oxygenation, and potential death despite artificial ventilation. Older patients may not be suitable candidates for pharmaceutical intervention targeting IL-1/6 blockade or artificial ventilation. Low dose total lung (LDTL) irradiation at a single dose of 50 cGy may stop this cytokine cascade, thus preventing, and/or reversing normal organs damage. This therapy has been proven in the past to be effective against pneumonitis of diverse etiology and could be used to prevent death of older infected patients.

    "abstract": "Pulsatile tinnitus, ear fullness, vertigo, hearing disorders, and vestibular dysfunction have been found to be related to high jugular bulb. Anatomical variation in this region also affects surgical planning and approaches. Therefore, knowledge on the detailed anatomy of the high jugular bulb is critical for middle ear and lateral skull base surgery. Prevalence of high jugular bulb is uncertain as data are usually derived from temporal bone specimens and patient reports from hospitals. Therefore, a community-based epidemiological study is necessary to understand the significance of high jugular bulb anatomy. Here, we report a cross-sectional study to characterize the prevalence of high jugular bulb and jugular bulb size using a 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, we studied the relationship between the prevalence of high jugular bulb and age-related changes. We enrolled 4539 permanent residents (9078 ears) from two communities in the Shanghai region who underwent magnetic resonance imaging between 2007 and 2011. We divided participants into four subgroups according to age: 35-44 (early middle age), 45-54 (middle age), 55-64 (late middle age), and 65-75 (late adulthood) years. We found that the overall prevalence of high jugular bulb was 14.5% in a Chinese population. There was a higher prevalence of high jugular bulb on the right side and especially in women (both <i>p</i> < 0.001). The occurrence of high jugular bulb was higher in the early middle age group and gradually decreased with age, but was still present in the late adulthood group (<i>p</i> = 0.039). These findings provide useful information on the prevalence of high jugular bulb in a Chinese population and the distribution in age groups, suggesting that high jugular bulb should be considered, even in those without ear disorders. This work serves as a foundation for further research on the relationship between jugular bulb changes and disease symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Recently, emerging evidence has indicated that COVID-19 represents a major threat to older populations, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The pathogen causing COVID-19 is acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on the key entry factors, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). Recognizing the importance of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 for the cellular tropism of SARS-CoV-2, we analyzed and presented the landscape of cell-type identities for ACE2<sup>+</sup> TMPRSS2<sup>+</sup> cells across different human tissues and the age-related alterations in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression across different cell types. Additionally, most of the post-acute COVID-19 sequelae could attribute to the ACE2-expressing organ systems. Therefore, these SARS-CoV-2 tropism data should be an essential resource for guiding clinical treatment and pathological studies, which should draw attention toward the prioritization of COVID-19 research in the future. Notably, we discovered the age-related expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the immune-inflammatory stromal cells, implying the potential interplay between COVID-19, stromal cells, and aging. In this study, we developed a novel and practical analysis framework for mapping the cellular tropism of SARS-CoV-2. This approach was built to aid the identification of viral-specific cell types and age-related alterations of viral tropism, highlighting the power of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to address viral pathogenesis systematically. With the rapid accumulation of scRNA-seq data and the continuously increasing insight into viral entry factors, we anticipate that this scRNA-seq-based approach will attract broader interest in the virus research communities.",

    "abstract": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are single-stranded RNA viruses which following virus attachment and entry into the host cell, particularly type 2 pneumocytes but also endothelial cells, release RNA into cytosol where it serves as a matrix for the host translation machinery to produce viral proteins. The viral RNA in cytoplasm can interact with host cell microRNAs which can degrade viral RNA and/or prevent viral replication. As such host cellular miRNAs represent key cellular mediators of antiviral defense. Polyphenols, plant food bioactives, exert antiviral properties, which is partially due to their capacity to modulate the expression of miRNAs. The objective of this work was to assess if polyphenols can play a role in prevention of SARS-CoV-2 associated complications by modulating the expression of host miRNAs. To test this hypothesis, we performed literature search to identify miRNAs that could bind SARS-CoV-2 RNA as well as miRNAs which expression can be modulated by polyphenols in lung, type 2 pneumocytes or endothelial cells. We identified over 600 miRNAs that have capacity to bind viral RNA and 125 miRNAs which expression can be modulated by polyphenols in the cells of interest. We identified that there are 17 miRNAs with both the capacity to bind viral RNA and which expression can be modulated by polyphenols. Some of these miRNAs have been identified as having antiviral properties or can target genes involved in regulation of processes of viral replication, apoptosis or viral infection. Taken together this analysis suggests that polyphenols could modulate expression of miRNAs in alveolar and endothelial cells and exert antiviral capacity.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is closely associated with the slowing of glucose metabolism in the brain. Glucose transport, a rate-limiting step of glucose metabolism, plays a key role in this phenomenon. Previous studies have reported that limb remote ischemic conditioning (LRIC) improves cognitive performance in rats with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH). Here, we determined whether LRIC could ameliorate cognitive impairment in rats with CCH by regulating glucose transport. A total of 170 male Sprague-Dawley rats were used. Animals subjected to permanent double carotid artery occlusion (2VO) were assigned to the control or LRIC treatment group. LRIC was applied beginning 3 days after the 2VO surgery. We found that LRIC can improve learning and memory; decrease the ratio of ADP/ATP; increase glucose content; upregulate the expression of pAMPKα, GLUT1 and GLUT3; and increase the number of GLUT1 and GLUT3 transporters in cerebral cortical neurons. The expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3 in the cortex displayed a strong correlation with learning and memory. Pearson correlation analysis showed that the levels of GLUT1 and GLUT3 are correlated with neurological function scores. All of these beneficial effects of LRIC were ablated by application of the AMPK inhibitor, dorsomorphin. In summary, LRIC ameliorated cognitive impairment in rats with CCH by regulating glucose transport via the AMPK/GLUT signaling pathway. We conclude that AMPK-mediated glucose transport plays a key role in LRIC. These data also suggest that supplemental activation of glucose transport after CCH may provide a clinically applicable intervention for improving cognitive impairment.",

Mucormycosis in patients of COVID-19 in India is at variance to other countries where Aspergillus, Pneumocystis, and Candida have been reported to be the major secondary fungal pathogens. We discuss the probable causes of the mucormycosis epidemic in India. Whereas dysglycaemia and inappropriate steroid use have been widely suggested as tentative reasons, we explore other biological, iatrogenic, and environmental factors. The likelihood of a two-hit pathogenesis remains strong. We propose that COVID-19 itself provides the predisposition to invasive mucormycosis (first hit), through upregulation of GRP78 and downregulation of spleen tyrosine kinase involved in anti-fungal defense, as also through inhibition of CD8+ T-cell mediated immunity. The other iatrogenic and environmental factors may provide the second hit which may have resulted in the surge.",

Recovered COVID-19 patients go through several long-term side effects such as fatigue, headaches, dizziness, weight loss, and muscle loss among others. Our study sought to determine the molecular mechanisms behind muscle loss in COVID-19 patients. We hypothesized that multiple factors such as cytokine storm and therapeutic drugs (glucocorticoid and antiviral drugs) might be involved in muscle loss. Using the Gene Expression Omnibus database, we identified several studies that performed RNA sequencing on skeletal muscles with the treatment of cytokine, glucocorticoid, and antiviral drugs. Our study identified cytokines, such as IL-1b, and IL-6, associated with altered regulation of several genes involved in the myogenic processes, including Ttn, Cxxc5, Malat1, and Foxo1. We also observed that glucocorticoid altered the expression of Foxo1, Lcn2, Slc39a14, and Cdkn1a. Finally, we found out that the antiviral (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor) drug regulates the expression of some of the muscle-related genes (Txnip, Ccnd1, Hdac9, and Fbxo32). Based on our findings, we hypothesize that the cytokine storm, glucocorticoids, and antiviral drugs might be synergistically involved in COVID-19-dependent muscle loss.",

Anti-hypertensive therapy has achieved effective; however, incomplete results in treating CSVD, suggesting the need for additional treatments. Targeting abnormal inflammatory responses has become a topic of research interest. Small artery remodeling is the main pathological feature of CSVD. Inhibition of the E-prostanoid 3 (EP3) receptor has been shown to attenuate vascular remodeling in peripheral organs; however, little is known about its role in CSVD. Therefore, we investigated whether the deletion of EP3 attenuates the development of CSVD in an animal model-- stroke-prone renovascular hypertensive rat (RHRsp). We found that the cerebral small arteries of RHRsp exhibited increased EP3 expression. Despite no alleviation of hypertension, the deletion of EP3 still attenuated the cerebral small artery remodeling of RHRsp, as evidenced by reduced overexpression of extracellular matrix (ECM) in the vessel. In vitro experiments indicated that EP3 deletion regulated the expression of ECM by downregulating TGF-β1/Smad signaling. Furthermore, the Morris water maze test and magnetic resonance test demonstrated that EP3 knockout attenuated cognitive impairment of the RHRsp, possibly through increased cerebral blood flow. Together, our results indicate that the deletion of EP3 attenuates vascular remodeling and vascular cognitive impairment induced by hypertension, and blockade of the EP3 receptor may be a promising strategy for the treatment of CSVD.",

    "abstract": "Tissue ischemia and hypoxia caused by the abnormal proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in the diabetic state is an important pathological basis for diabetic microangiopathy. Studies in recent years have shown that the chronic complications of diabetes are related to the decrease of endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in diabetic patients, and it has been proven that H2S can inhibit the proliferation of vascular SMCs (VSMCs). Our study showed that the endogenous H2S content and the expression of cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE), which is the key enzyme of H2S production, were decreased in arterial SMCs of diabetic mice. The expression of PCNA and Cyclin D1 was increased, and the expression of p21 was decreased in the diabetic state. After administration of dopamine 1-like receptors (DR1) agonist SKF38393 and exogenous H2S donor NaHS, the expression of CSE was increased and the change in proliferation-related proteins caused by diabetes was reversed. It was further verified by cell experiments that SKF38393 activated calmodulin (CaM) by increasing the intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) concentration, which activated the CSE/H2S pathway, enhancing the H2S content in vivo. We also found that SKF38393 and NaHS inhibited insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)/IGF-1R and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF)/EGFR, as well as their downstream PI3K/Akt, JAK2/STAT3 and ERK1/2 pathways. Taken together, our results suggest that DR1 activation up-regulates the CSE/H2S system by increasing Ca2+-CaM binding, which inhibits the IGF-1/IGF-1R and HB-EGF/EGFR pathways, thereby decreasing their downstream PI3K/Akt, JAK2/STAT3 and ERK1/2 pathways to achieve the effect of inhibiting HG-induced VSMCs proliferation.",

Here, we showed that in vivo and in vitro supplementation of folic acid (FA) efficaciously improved the quality of NaF-exposed oocytes. FA supplementation not only increased ovulation of oocytes from NaF-treated mice but also enhanced oocyte meiotic competency and fertilization ability by restoring the spindle/chromosome structure. Moreover, FA supplementation could exert a beneficial effect on NaF- exposed oocytes by restoring mitochondrial function, eliminating reactive oxygen species accumulation to suppress apoptosis. We also found that FA supplementation restored the defective phenotypes in oocytes through a Sirt1/Sod2-dependent mechanism. Inhibition of Sirt1 with EX527 abolished the FA-mediated improvement in NaF-exposed oocyte quality. Collectively, our data indicated that FA supplementation is a feasible approach to protect oocytes from NaF-related deterioration.",

DOC encompasses coma, vegetative state, and minimally conscious state based on neurobehavioral function. Currently, DOC is one of the most common neurological disorders with a rapidly increasing incidence worldwide. Therefore, DOC not only impacts the lives of individuals and their families but is also becoming a serious public health threat. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can stimulate electrical activity using a pulsed magnetic field in the brain, with great value in the treatment of chronic pain, neurological diseases, and mental illnesses. However, the clinical application of rTMS in patients with DOC is debatable. Herein, we report the recent main findings of the clinical therapeutics of rTMS for DOC, including its efficacy and possible mechanisms. In addition, we discuss the potential key parameters (timing, location, frequency, strength, and secession of rTMS applications) that affect the therapeutic efficiency of rTMS in patients with DOC. This review may help develop clinical guidelines for the therapeutic application of rTMS in DOC.",

    "abstract": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a multifactorial disease characterized by various pathophysiological processes, including chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and proteolytic activity in the aortic wall. Stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) has been implicated in regulating these pathophysiological processes, but whether SIPS contributes to AAA formation remains unknown. Here, we detected SIPS in AAA from patients and young mice. The senolytic agent ABT263 prevented AAA development by inhibiting SIPS. Additionally, SIPS promoted the transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from a contractile phenotype to a synthetic phenotype, whereas inhibition of SIPS by the senolytic drug ABT263 suppressed VSMC phenotypic switching. RNA sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed that fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9), secreted by stress-induced premature senescent VSMCs, was a key regulator of VSMC phenotypic switching and that FGF9 knockdown abolished this effect. We further showed that the FGF9 level was critical for the activation of PDGFRβ/ERK1/2 signaling, facilitating VSMC phenotypic change. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that SIPS is critical for VSMC phenotypic switching through the activation of FGF9/PDGFRβ/ERK1/2 signaling, promoting AAA development and progression. Thus, targeting SIPS with the senolytic agent ABT263 may be a valuable therapeutic strategy for the prevention or treatment of AAA.",

    "abstract": "Intervertebral disc degeneration is a leading cause of disability in the elderly population. Rigid extracellular matrix is a critical pathological feature of disc degeneration, leading to aberrant nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) proliferation. However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we hypothesize that increased matrix stiffness induces proliferation and thus degenerative phenotypes of NPCs through YAP/TEAD1 signaling pathway. We established hydrogel substrates to mimic stiffness of degenerated human nucleus pulposus tissues. RNA-sequencing identified differentially expressed genes between primary rat NPCs cultured on rigid and soft hydrogels. Dual luciferase assay and gain- and loss-function experiments evaluated the correlation between YAP/TEAD1 and Cyclin B1. Furthermore, single-cell RNA-sequencing of human NPCs was performed to identify specific cell clusters with high YAP expression. Matrix stiffness increased in severely degenerated human nucleus pulposus tissues (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Rigid substrate enhanced rat NPCs proliferation mainly through Cyclin B1, which was directly targeted and positively regulated by YAP/TEAD1. Depletion of YAP or Cyclin B1 arrested G2/M phase progression of rat NPCs and reduced fibrotic phenotypes including MMP13 and CTGF (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Fibro NPCs with high YAP expression were identified in human tissues and responsible for fibrogenesis during degeneration. Furthermore, inhibition of YAP/TEAD interaction by verteporfin suppressed cell proliferation and alleviated degeneration in the disc needle puncture model (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Our results demonstrate that elevated matrix stiffness stimulates fibro NPCs proliferation through YAP/TEAD1-Cyclin B1 axis, indicating a therapeutic target for disc degeneration.",

This study aimed to explore the role of core fucosylation and the only glycosyltransferase FUT8 in PAH. We observed increased core fucosylation in a monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PAH rat model and isolated rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) treated with platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB). We found that 2-fluorofucose (2FF), a drug used to inhibit core fucosylation, improved hemodynamics and pulmonary vascular remodeling in MCT-induced PAH rats. In vitro, 2FF effectively restrains the proliferation, migration, and phenotypic switching of PASMCs and promotes apoptosis. Compared with controls, serum FUT8 concentration in PAH patients and MCT-induced rats was significantly elevated. FUT8 expression appeared increased in the lung tissues of PAH rats, and the co-localization of FUT8 with α-SMA was also observed. SiRNA was used to knockdown FUT8 in PASMCs (siFUT8). After effectively silencing FUT8 expression, phenotypic changes induced in PASMCs by PDGF-BB stimulation were alleviated. FUT8 activated the AKT pathway, while the admission of AKT activator SC79 could partially counteract the negative effect of siFUT8 on the proliferation, apoptotic resistance, and phenotypic switching of PASMCs, which may be involved in the core fucosylation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR). Our research confirmed the critical role of FUT8 and its mediated core fucosylation in pulmonary vascular remodeling in PAH, providing a potential novel therapeutic target for PAH.",

The current cohort study included COVID-19 survivors aged 60 years and above, who were discharged between February 12 and April 10, 2020, from two designated hospitals in Wuhan, China. All patients were contacted via telephone and completed a standardized questionnaire assessing self-reported symptoms, the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS)-fatigue subscale, and two subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Of the 1,212 patients surveyed, the median (IQR) age was 68.0 (64.0-72.0), and 586 (48.3%) were male. At the two-year follow-up, 259 patients (21.4%) still reported at least one symptom. The most frequently self-reported symptoms were fatigue, anxiety, and dyspnea. Fatigue or myalgia, which was the most common symptom cluster (11.8%; 143/1212), often co-occurred with anxiety and chest symptoms. A total of 89 patients (7.7%) had CIS-fatigue scores ≥ 27, with older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.08; 95% CI: 1.05-1.11, P < 0.001) and oxygen therapy (OR, 2.19; 95% CI: 1.06-4.50, P= 0.03) being risk factors.

For the 59 patients (5.2%) who had HADS total scores ≥ 16, older age, serious illness during hospitalization and coexisting cerebrovascular diseases were risk factors. Cooccurring fatigue, anxiety, and chest symptoms, as well as depression, were mainly responsible for long-term symptom burden among older COVID-19 survivors 2 years after discharge.",

    "abstract": "The main pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) and related synucleinopathies is the presence of intracellular proteinaceous aggregates, enriched in the presynaptic protein alpha-Synuclein (α-Syn). α-Syn association with exosomes has been previously documented both as a physiological process of secretion and as a pathological process of disease transmission, however, critical information about the mechanisms governing this interplay is still lacking. To address this, we utilized the α-Syn preformed fibril (PFF) mouse model of PD, as a source of brain-derived exosome-enriched extracellular vesicles (ExE-EVs) and assessed their pathogenic capacity following intrastriatal injections in host wild type (WT) mouse brain. We further investigated the impact of the fibrillar α-Syn on the exosomal cargo independent of the endogenous α-Syn, by isolating ExE-EVs from PFF-injected α-Syn knockout mice. Although PFF inoculation does not alter the morphology, size distribution, and quantity of brain-derived ExE-EVs, it triggers changes in the exosomal proteome related to synaptic and mitochondrial function, as well as metabolic processes. Importantly, we showed that the presence of the endogenous α-Syn is essential for the ExE-EVs to acquire a pathogenic capacity, allowing them to mediate disease transmission by inducing phosphorylated-α-Syn pathology. Notably, misfolded α-Syn containing ExE-EVs when injected in WT mice were able to induce astrogliosis and synaptic alterations in the host brain, at very early stages of α-Syn pathology, preceding the formation of the insoluble α-Syn accumulations. Collectively, our data suggest that exosomal cargo defines their ability to spread α-Syn pathology.",

In this study, we detected the upregulation of the SASP-related protein dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DDP4) in human primary lung cells rendered senescent by exposure to ionizing radiation. DPP4 is an exopeptidase that plays a crucial role in the cleavage of various proteins, resulting in the loss of N-terminal dipeptides and proinflammatory effects. Interestingly, our data revealed an association between severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and DDP4, namely that DPP4 levels increased in the plasma of patients with COVID-19 and were correlated with age and disease progression. Although we could not determine the direct effect of DDP4 on viral replication, mechanistic studies in cell culture revealed a negative impact on the expression of the tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), which contributes to epithelial barrier function. Mass spectrometry analysis indicated that DPP4 overexpressing cells exhibited a decrease in ZO-1 and increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. By investigating the effect of DPP4 on the barrier function of human primary cells, we detected an increase in ZO-1 using DPP4 inhibitors. These results provide an important contribution to our understanding of DPP4 in the context of senescence, suggesting that DPP4 plays a major role as part of the SASP. Our results provide evidence that cellular senescence, a hallmark of aging, has an important impact on respiratory infections.",

In this study, we performed the two-steps verification to assess P2Y1R inhibition in AD progression: P2Y1R-KO AD mice and AD mice treated with astrocyte-specific P2Y1R gene knockdown by using shRNAs for P2Y1R in adeno-associated virus vector. Histochemistry was conducted for the assessment of amyloid-beta accumulation, neuroinflammation and blood brain barrier function. Expression of inflammatory cytokines was evaluated by qPCR after the separation of astrocytes. Cognitive function was assessed through the Morris water maze, Y maze, and contextual fear conditioning tests. P2Y1R inhibition not only by gene knockout but also by astrocyte-specific knockdown reduced amyloid-beta accumulation, glial neuroinflammation, blood brain barrier dysfunction, and cognitive impairment in an AD mice model. Reduced neuroinflammation by astrocytic P2Y1R silencing in AD was further confirmed by the reduction of IL-6 gene expression after the separation of astrocytes from AD mouse brain, which may relate to the amelioration of blood brain barrier as well as cognitive functions. Our results clearly note that P2Y1R in astrocyte contributes to the progression of AD pathology through the acceleration of neuroinflammation, and one-time gene therapy for silencing astrocytic P2Y1R may offer a new therapeutic target for AD.",

The clinical effects of recently developed anti-amyloid therapy for Alzheimer’s disease were modest and the long-term outcome is unknown. Thus, an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of brain aging is essential to develop preventive interventions to maintain cognitive health in late life. Mounting evidence suggests that arterial aging manifested as increases in central arterial stiffness is associated closely with cerebrovascular dysfunction and brain aging while improvement of cerebrovascular function with aerobic exercise training contributes to brain health in older adults. We summarized evidence in this brief review that 1) increases in central arterial stiffness and arterial pulsation with age are associated with increases in cerebrovascular resistance, reduction in cerebral blood flow, and cerebrovascular dysfunction, 2) aerobic exercise training improves cerebral blood flow by modifying arterial aging as indicated by reductions in cerebrovascular resistance, central arterial stiffness, arterial pulsation, and improvement in cerebrovascular function, and 3) improvement in cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular function with aerobic exercise training may lead to improvement in cognitive function. These findings highlight the associations between arterial aging and cerebrovascular function and the importance of aerobic exercise in maintaining brain health in older adults.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Promising therapies for PD still need to be explored. Immune dysfunction has been found to be involved in PD pathogenesis. Here, a novel immunosuppressor, (5R)-5-hydroxytriptolide (LLDT8), was used to treat 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced hemiparkinson rats. We found that oral administration of LLDT8 significantly alleviated apomorphine-induced rotations at a dose of 125 µg/kg, and improved performance in cylinder and rotarod tests at a lower dose of 31.25 µg/kg, in 6-OHDA hemiparkinsonian rats. Moreover, loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) of the 6-OHDA rat was attenuated in response to LLDT8 treatment in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, inflammatory factors IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, were significantly inhibited in LLDT8-treated hemiparkisonian rats, compared with vehicle. Notably, the level of dopamine (DA) in the striatum of PD rats was restored by LLDT8 treatment. Furthermore, we also detected that the disequilibrium of peripheral lymphocytes was reversed by LLDT8 administration. Taken together, the results imply that the immunosuppressor, LLDT8, can rescue dopaminergic neurodegeneration in 6-OHDA hemiparkinsonian rats, thus providing a potential therapeutic strategy for PD.",

In this study, we investigate the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of APX3330 treatment in type one diabetes mellitus (T1DM) stroke rats. Adult male Wistar rats were induced with T1DM and subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) and treated with either PBS or APX3330 (10mg/kg, oral gavage) starting at 24h after MCAo, and daily for 14 days. Rats were sacrificed at 14 days after MCAo and, blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability, ischemic lesion volume, immunohistochemistry, cell death assay, Western blot, real time PCR, and angiogenic ELISA array were performed. Compared to PBS treatment, APX3330 treatment of stroke in T1DM rats significantly improves neurological functional outcome, decreases lesion volume, and improves BBB integrity as well as decreases total vessel density and VEGF expression, while significantly increases arterial density in the ischemic border zone (IBZ). APX3330 significantly increases myelin density, oligodendrocyte number, oligodendrocyte progenitor cell number, synaptic protein expression, and induces M2 macrophage polarization in the IBZ of T1DM stroke rats. Compared to PBS treatment, APX3330 treatment significantly decreases plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and receptor for advanced glycation endproducts expression in the ischemic brain of T1DM stroke rats. APX3330 treatment significantly decreases cell death and MMP9 and PAI-1 gene expression in cultured primary cortical neurons subjected to high glucose and oxygen glucose deprivation, compared to untreated control cells. APX3330 treatment increases M2 macrophage polarization and decreases inflammatory factor expression in the ischemic brain as well as promotes neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects after stroke in T1DM rats.",

Although postprandial lipidemia is increased in older subjects, the specific chylomicron metabolism has not been explored in older subjects nor compared to young subjects, which is the focus of this study. After a 12 h fast, artificially-made emulsions similar to lymph chylomicrons and doubly labeled with radioactive cholesteryl esters and triglycerides were intravenously injected in 23 older (66±4 years) and 20 young (24±3 years) subjects. Sequential blood samples were collected to determine fractional clearance rates (FCR, in min-1) by compartmental analysis. Older subjects had higher LDL-cholesterol (p<0.001) and triglycerides (p<0.0001) than young subjects; HDL-cholesterol presented no difference. The emulsion cholesteryl-ester FCR was lower in older subjects compared to the young (p=0.0001). The emulsion triglyceride FCR did not differ in the two groups. Tested in vitro, however, the lipolysis of the emulsion triglycerides was less intense in the older than in the young subjects. As delayed removal of remnants, indicated by the pronouncedly smaller cholesteryl ester FCR, is related to the presence of cardiovascular diseases, this can be a risk factor which could accelerate atherogenic complications occurring in aged subjects.",

    "abstract": "Recent research suggests that intestinal microbiota affect the aging process. Glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2), a growth factor found in the intestinal mucosal epithelium, reduces intestinal permeability and affects intestinal microbiota. The relationship between aging, GLP-2, and intestinal microbiota are still not well understood. The current study examined the influence of aging and GLP-2 on the intestinal microbiota of rats. Twelve 3-month old male SD rats were randomly divided into two groups: a young control group (group C) and a young GLP-2 treatment group (group G). Twelve 26-month old male SD rats were randomly divided into two groups: an aged control group (group L) and an aged GLP-2 treatment group (group T). GLP-2 was intraperitoneally injected into rats from group G and group T for 14 days. Plasma GLP-2 concentration was evaluated by ELISA tests. Fresh intestinal stool samples were collected from each group and total fecal bacterial genomic DNA was extracted from the associated rats. The bacterial composition of fecal samples was analyzed by Miseq high-throughput sequencing and comparison with SRA databases. Overall, the diversity of intestinal microbiota significantly decreases with age in SD rats, while GLP-2 has no significant effect on the diversity of intestinal microbiota. Upon aging, there is a reduction in probiotic bacteria and a concomitant increase in pathogenic bacteria in rats. Treatment with GLP-2 results in a significant reduction in the prevalence of pathogenic bacterial genera and an increase in some potential benefit bacteria in aged rats. In addition, treatment with GLP-2 results in an increase in several probiotics and a reduction in the prevalence of pathogenic bacterial genera in young rats.",

The five-minute cognitive test (FCT) was designed to capture deficits in five domains of cognitive abilities, including episodic memory, language fluency, time orientation, visuospatial function, and executive function. Subsequently, FCT efficiencies in differentiating normally cognitive ability from cognitive impairment were explored and compared with that of the Mini-Mental Status Evaluation (MMSE). Equipercentile equating method was utilized to create a crosswalk between scores of the FCT and MMSE. Further, the association of scores of the FCT and MMSE with hippocampal volumes was investigated. There were 241 subjects aged 60 years or above enrolled in this study, including 107 adults with cognitive abilities in normal range, 107 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 27 patients with mild Alzheimer disease (AD). The AUC of FCT for detection of cognitive impairment (MCI and mild AD) was 0.885 (95% CI 0.838 to 0.922). The sensitivity and specificity of FCT for the diagnosis of cognitive impairment were 80.6% and 84.11 %, respectively. FCT's diagnostic performance was superior to that of MMSE in the same cohort. Mean completion time of FCT was 339.9 ± 67.7 seconds (5-6 min). In addition, a conversion table between scores on the FCT and MMSE was created. Further, the FCT scores were positively correlated with hippocampal volumes. The FCT is a novel, reliable, and valid cognitive screening test for the detection of dementia at early stages.",

Plasma EGF level was significantly decreased in early PD patients compared with normal control, but not in advanced PD patients. Interestingly, plasma EGF level was significantly increased in advanced PD and total PD patients compared with ET patients, but not in early PD patients. In addition, plasma EGF level was correlated with UPDRS-III scores in PD. Also plasma EGF level was correlated with UPDRS-III scores and NMS scores in early PD. Our results suggested that plasma EGF decreased in the early stage of PD and increased later on in the PD disease course.

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) increases during lifespan and is involved in aging processes. The p66Shc adaptor protein is a master regulator of oxidative stress response in mammals. Ablation of p66Shc enhances oxidative stress resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Most importantly, it has been demonstrated that its deletion retards aging in mice. Recently, new insights in the molecular mechanisms involving p66Shc and the p53 tumor suppressor genes were given: a specific p66Shc/p53 transcriptional regulation pathway was uncovered as determinant in oxidative stress response and, likely, in aging. p53, in a p66Shc-dependent manner, negatively downregulates the expression of 200 genes which are involved in the G2/M transition of mitotic cell cycle and are downregulated during physiological aging. p66Shc modulates the response of p53 by activating a p53 isoform (p44/p53, also named Delta40p53). Based on these latest results, several developments are expected in the future, as the generation of animal models to study aging and the evaluation of the use of the p53/p66Shc target genes as biomarkers in aging related diseases. The aim of this review is to investigate the conservation of the p66Shc and p53 role in oxidative stress between fish and mammals. We propose to approach this study trough a new model organism, the annual fish Nothobranchius furzeri, that has been demonstrated to develop typical signs of aging, like in mammals, including senescence, neurodegeneration, metabolic disorders and cancer.",

During 2005-2014, 2693 elderly (aged 65 to 100 years) individuals from 21 Mediterranean islands in Greece, Italy and Spain as well as Cyprus, Malta, and the rural region of Mani (southeast continental region of Greece keeping old-time traditions), were voluntarily recruited. Successful aging was evaluated using a validated index composed of 10 health-related socio-lifestyle and clinical characteristics. After accounting for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, smoking habits, MedDietScore and access to health care services, the older inhabitants of islands were found to have a higher level of the successful aging index when compared to their counterparts in Mani (Beta=0.174, p<0.001); moreover, islanders exhibited slightly more years of \"good\" health (68.7 vs 68.4 years for Mani residents (p=0.99)). However, compared to the residents of Mani, islanders had 1.64 times higher odds (95%CI, 1.08-2.48) for having hypertension, 2.4-times higher odds (95%CI, 1.34-4.21) for having diabetes and 1.52 times higher odds (95%CI, 0.97-2.38) for having hypercholesterolemia. Engaging in physical activities and healthy dietary habits were the major determinants of healthy aging, among islanders as compared to their counterparts of continental Mani region. Elder residents of the continental Mani area enjoyed a better health status, whereas elder islanders had a higher level of successful aging; a finding which could be attributed to differences in lifestyle among elders.",

This study aims to distinguish patterns of cortical decline determined by advancing age and disease duration in PD. A convenience cohort of 177 consecutive PD patients, identified at the Vanderbilt University Movement Disorders Clinic as part of a clinical evaluation for Deep Brain Stimulation (age: M= 62.0, SD 9.3), completed a standardized clinical assessment, along with structural brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging scan. Age and gender matched controls (n=53) were obtained from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and Progressive Parkinson's Marker Initiative (age: M= 63.4, SD 12.2). Estimated changes in cortical thickness were modeled with advancing age, disease duration, and their interaction. The best-fitting model, linear or curvilinear (2<sup>nd</sup>, or 3<sup>rd</sup> order natural spline), was defined using the minimum Akaike Information Criterion, and illustrated on a 3-dimensional brain. Three curvilinear patterns of cortical thinning were identified: early decline, late decline, and early-stable-late. In contrast to healthy controls, the best-fit model for age related changes in PD is curvilinear (early decline), particularly in frontal and precuneus regions. With advancing disease duration, a curvilinear model depicts accelerating decline in the occipital cortex. A significant interaction between advancing age and disease duration is evident in frontal, motor, and posterior parietal areas. Study results support the hypothesis that advancing age and disease duration differentially affect regional cortical thickness and display regional dependent linear and curvilinear patterns of thinning.",

In this study, we used tracer-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to quantitatively investigate the alterations in ISS and visualize ISF flow in the caudate nucleus in a rotenone-induced rat model of PD treated with and without madopar. In the rotenone-induced rat model, the ISF flow was slowed and the tortuosity of the ISS was significantly decreased. Administration of madopar partially prevented these changes of ISS and ISF. Therefore, our data suggest that tracer-based MRI can be used to monitor the parameters related to ISF flow and ISS microstructure.

    "abstract": "Liver is a vital organ with many important functions, and the maintenance of normal hepatic function is necessary for health. As an essential mechanism for maintaining cellular homeostasis, autophagy plays an important role in ensuring normal organ function. Studies have indicated that the degeneration of hepatic function is associated with autophagic deficiency in aging liver. However, the underlying mechanisms still remain unclear. The serine protease Omi/HtrA2 belongs to the HtrA family and promotes apoptosis through either the caspase-dependent or caspase-independent pathway. Mice lacking Omi/HtrA2 exhibited progeria symptoms (premature aging), which were similar to the characteristics of autophagic insufficiency. In this study, we demonstrated that both the protein level of Omi/HtrA2 in liver and hepatic function were reduced as rats aged, and there was a positive correlation between them. Furthermore, several autophagy-related proteins (LC3II/I, Beclin-1 and LAMP2) in rat liver were decreased significantly with the increasing of age. Finally, inhibition of Omi/HtrA2 resulted in reduced autophagy and hepatic dysfunction. In conclusion, these results suggest that Omi/HtrA2 participates in age-related autophagic deficiency in rat liver. This study may offer a novel insight into the mechanism involved in liver aging.",

In contrast, transcript levels of several mitogens (transforming growth factor α, epidermal growth factor and fibroblast growth factor 2) do not decline with age in the human SEZ, suggesting that other growth factors may contribute to the reduced neurogenic potential. While insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF1) regulates neurogenesis throughout aging in the mouse brain, the extent to which IGF1 and IGF family members change with age and relate to adult neurogenesis markers in the human SEZ has not yet been determined. We used quantitative polymerase chain reaction to examine gene expression of seven IGF family members [IGF1, IGF1 receptor, insulin receptor and high-affinity IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) 2, 3, 4 and 5] in the human SEZ across the adult lifespan (n=50, 21-103 years). We found that only IGF1 expression significantly decreased with increasing age. IGFBP2 and IGFBP4 expression positively correlated with Ki67 mRNA. IGF1 expression positively correlated with doublecortin mRNA, whereas IGFBP2 expression negatively correlated with doublecortin mRNA. Our results suggest IGF family members are local regulators of neurogenesis and indicate that the age-related reduction in IGF1 mRNA may limit new neuron production by restricting neuronal differentiation in the human SEZ.",

Histologically, Yap deficient lens show fewer epithelial cells, retention of nuclei and accumulation of morgagnian globules in the transitional zone and the posterior area. Mechanistically, GFAP-mediated Yap cKO leads to the reduced proliferation of epithelial cells, delayed fiber cell denucleation and increased cellular senescence in lens. Further RNA profiling analysis reveals Yap cKO results in a significant alteration in gene transcription that is involved in eye development, lens structure, inflammation, cellular proliferation and polarity.

    "abstract": "Currently, disease-modified strategies to prevent, halt or reverse the progress of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are still lacking. Previous studies indicated extracts or compounds from Cistanches (ECC) exert a potential neuroprotective effect against AD. Thus, we conducted a preclinical systematic review to assess preclinical evidence and possible mechanisms of ECC in experimental AD. A systematical searching strategy was carried out across seven databases from their inceptions to July 2018. Twenty studies with 1696 rats or mice were involved. Neurobehavioral function indices as primary outcome measures were established by the Morris water maze test (n = 11), step-down test (n = 10), electrical Y-maze test (n = 4), step-through test (n = 3), open field test (n = 2) and passage water maze test (n = 1). Compared with controls, the results of the meta-analysis showed ECC exerted a significant effect in decreasing the escape latency, error times and wrong reaction latency in both the training test and the retention test, and in increasing the exact time and the percentage of time in the platform-quadrant and the number of platform crossings (all <i>P</i><0.01). In conclusion, ECC exert potential neuroprotective effects in experimental AD, mainly through mechanisms involving antioxidant stress and antiapoptosic effects, inhibiting Aβ deposition and tau protein hyperphosphorylation and promoting synapse protection. Thus, ECC could be a candidate for AD treatment and further clinical trials.",

To analyze the phenotypes and genotypes of EOAD patients, we performed comprehensive clinical assessments as well as mutation screening of PSEN1, PSEN2, and exons 16 and 17 of APP by Sanger sequencing in the three Chinese EOAD families. We identified two novel mutations of PSEN1 (Y256N and H214R) in samples from these families, and a de novo mutation of PSEN1 (G206V) in a patient with very early-onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease. A combination of bioinformatics tools based on evolutionary, structural and computational methods predicted that the mutations were all deleterious. These findings suggest that PSEN1 Y256N, H214R, and G206V need to be considered as potential causative mutations in EOAD patients. Further functional studies are needed to evaluate the roles of these mutations in the pathogenesis of AD.",

    "abstract": "Better understanding of survival factors in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) could help physicians and patients schedule therapeutic interventions. We conducted a study to evaluate the predictive factors associated with longer survival and construct prognostic nomogram in ALS patients. A total of 553 ALS patients were enrolled and divided into 2 groups: a training set and a validation set. Risk factors for survival were identified using logistic regression analysis, and a nomogram created by R program was performed to predict the probability of longer survival in the training set; then receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was applied to assess predictive value of the nomogram model. The median survival time was 3.2 years for all patients. Multivariate analyses revealed that age of onset, rate of disease progression, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level, body mass index, creatinine, creatine kinase (CK), and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) were independent predictors of longer survival. A nomogram based on the above seven predictive factors was developed to predict the possibility of longer survival. The ROC curve of the nomogram demonstrated good discrimination ability with an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88-0.96) in the validation set. In ALS, serum CK, creatinine and HbA1c levels at baseline were independent biomarkers of longer survival. The prognostic nomogram model that integrated all significant independent factors for those who survived longer than 3 years provides an effective way to predict the probability of longer survival and can help doctors evaluate the disease progression and give personalized treatment recommendations.",

    "abstract": "A strategic approach is urgently needed to curb the growing global epidemic of diabetes. In this study, we investigated the effects and mechanisms of salsalate (SAL), an anti-inflammatory drug with anti-diabetic properties, assessing its potential to prevent diabetes in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rats (OLETF). All animals in our placebo group developed diabetes, whereas none in the SAL test group did so, and only 25% of SAL-treated rats displayed impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). SAL lowered levels of glucagon and raised levels of insulin in plasma, while improving both insulin sensitivity and β-cell function. The protective effect of SAL is likely due to diminished β-cell dedifferentiation, manifested as relative declines in Neurogenin 3<sup>+</sup>/insulin<sup>-</sup> cells and synaptophysin<sup>+</sup>/islet hormone<sup>-</sup> cells and increased expression of β-cell-specific transcription factor Foxo1. Both Notch1-siRNA and N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-1-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT; an indirect inhibitor of the Notch1 pathway) were shown to prevent β-cell dedifferentiation. Similar to DAPT, SAL effectively reduced β-cell dedifferentiation, significantly suppressing Notch1 pathway activation in INS-1 cells. The inhibitory role of SAL in β-cell dedifferentiation may thus be attributable to Notch1 pathway suppression.",

To derive a more precise estimation of these associations, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the three main polymorphisms (SstI, T-455C, C-482T) of APOC3 in all published studies. Databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Wanfang, SinoMed and CNKI were systematically searched. The association was assessed using odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3.3 and Stata 12.0. A total of 31 studies have been identified. The pooled odds ratio (OR) for the association between the APOC3 gene polymorphisms and CHD and its corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were evaluated by random or fixed effect models. A statistical association between APOC3 SstI polymorphism and CHD susceptibility was observed under an allelic contrast model (<i>P</i>= 0.003, OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.05-1.24), dominant genetic model (<i>P</i>= 0.01, OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.03-1.26), and recessive genetic model (<i>P</i>= 0.02, OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.06-1.71), respectively. A significant association between the APOC3 T-455C polymorphism and CHD was also detected under an allelic contrast (P < 0.0001, OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.10-1.29), dominant genetic model (<i>P</i>= 0.0003, OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.11-1.39) and recessive genetic model (<i>P</i>= 0.04, OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.01-1.67). No significant association between the APOC3 C-482T polymorphism and CHD was found under an allelic model (<i>P</i>= 0.94, OR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.93-1.08), dominant genetic model (<i>P</i>= 0.20, OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.97-1.18) or recessive genetic model (<i>P</i>= 0.13, OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.79-1.03). This meta-analysis revealed that the APOC3 SstI and T-455C polymorphisms significantly increase CHD susceptibility.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by the accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, is the most common form of neurodegenerative disease among the elderly. No effective treatment is available now in restricting the pathological progression of AD. The aim of this study is to determine the therapeutic efficacy of stem cell factor (SCF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (SCF+G-CSF) in aged APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice. SCF+G-CSF was subcutaneously injected for 12 days to 25-month-old male APP/PS1 mice. We observed that SCF+G-CSF treatment reduced the Aβ plaques in both the cortex and hippocampus. SCF+G-CSF treatment increased the association of TREM2<sup>+</sup>/Iba1<sup>+</sup> cells with Aβ plaques and enhanced Aβ uptake by Iba1<sup>+</sup> and CD68<sup>+</sup>cells in the brains of aged APP/PS1 mice. Importantly, cerebral expression area of P2RY12<sup>+</sup>and TMEM119<sup>+</sup> homeostatic microglia and the branches of P2RY12<sup>+</sup> homeostatic microglia were increased in the SCF+G-CSF-treated aged APP/PS1 mice. SCF+G-CSF treatment also decreased NOS-2 and increased IL-4 in the brains of aged APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, the loss of MAP2<sup>+</sup>dendrites and PSD-95<sup>+</sup>post-synapses and the accumulation of aggregated tau in the brains of aged APP/PS1 mice were ameliorated by SCF+G-CSF treatment. Furthermore, the density of P2RY12<sup>+</sup> microglia was negatively correlated with Aβ deposits, but positively correlated with the densities of MAP2<sup>+</sup> dendrites and PSD-95<sup>+</sup> puncta in the brains of aged APP/PS1 mice. These findings reveal the therapeutic potential of SCF+G-CSF treatment in ameliorating AD pathology at the late stage.",

The current surgical intervention for NMIBC includes transurethral resection of bladder tumor; however, its recurrence still remains a challenge. The BCG-based immunotherapy is much effective against low-grade NMIBC. BCG increases the influx of T cells at bladder cancer site and inhibits proliferation of bladder cancer cells. The chemotherapy is another traditional approach to address NMIBC by supplementing BCG. Notwithstanding, these current therapeutic measures possess limited efficacy in controlling NMIBC, and do not provide comprehensive long-term relief. Hence, biomaterials and scaffolds seem an effective medium to deliver therapeutic agents for restructuring bladder post-treatment. The regenerative therapies such as stem cells and PRP have also been explored for possible solution to NMIBC. Based on above-mentioned approaches, we have comprehensively analyzed therapeutic journey from traditional to regenerative interventions for the treatment of NMIBC.",

    "abstract": "An emerging concept termed the \"neuro-glia-vascular unit\" (NGVU) has been established in recent years to understand the complicated mechanism of multicellular interactions among vascular cells, glial cells, and neurons. It has been proverbially reported that the NGVU is significantly associated with neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Physiological aging is an inevitable progression associated with oxidative damage, bioenergetic alterations, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation, which is partially similar to the pathology of AD. Thus, senescence is regarded as the background for the development of neurodegenerative diseases. With the exacerbation of global aging, senescence is an increasingly serious problem in the medical field. In this review, the coupling of each component, including neurons, glial cells, and vascular cells, in the NGVU is described in detail. Then, various mechanisms of age-dependent impairment in each part of the NGVU are discussed. Moreover, the potential bioenergetic alterations between different cell types in the NGVU are highlighted, which seems to be an emerging physiopathology associated with the aged brain. Bioenergetic intervention in the NGVU may be a new direction for studies on delaying or diminishing aging in the future.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic alterations of brain contribute to age-related cognitive decline. The challenge now is to identify these tractable epigenetic molecules working as the downstream cell-signaling nodes mediating age-related cognitive decline. Here we reported age-related loss of miR-124 in human and rat brains. To further validate these findings, knockout mice in which one of the three miR-124 genes (miR-124-3) was deleted using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene engineering were generated. MiR-124-3 knockout mice developed cognitive deficit phenotype. MiR-124 deficiency in the mouse brain resulted in upregulation of the Ryanodine receptor 3 (<i>RyR3</i>) gene, and the cognitive deficits in miR-124-3 knockout mice were ameliorated by knocking down RyR3 expression using RNAi. In addition, miR-124 deficiency facilitated Aβ42-induced neuron apoptosis. Our work suggested that age-related cognitive decline, at least in part, was associated with miR-124 deficiency and subsequently upregulated RyR3 expression in inducing neuronal death.",

In this paper, we used 3S-ASCVD dogs, an ideal large animal human-like models for AS, to interrogate the heterogeneity of AS-prone and AS-resistant arteries; and at the single-cell level, identify the dominant cells involved in AS development. Here we present data from 3S-ASCVD dogs which reliably mimic human AS pathophysiology, predilection for lesion sites, and endpoint events. Our analysis combined bulk RNA-seq with single-cell RNA-seq to depict the transcriptomic profiles and cellular atlas of AS-prone and AS-resistant arteries in 3S-ASCVD dogs. Our results revealed the integral role of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in regional propensity for AS. Notably, TNC+ SMCs were major contributors to AS development in 3S-ASCVD dogs, indicating enhanced extracellular matrix remodeling and transition to myofibroblasts during the AS process. Moreover, TNC+ SMCs were also present in human AS-prone carotid plaques, suggesting a potential origin of myofibroblasts and supporting the relevance of our findings. Our study provides a promising large animal model for pre-clinical studies of ASCVD and add novel insights surrounding the regional propensity of AS development in humans, which may lead to interventions that delay or prevent lesion progression and adverse clinical events.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of myasthenia gravis (MG), an autoimmune disorder, is increasing among all subsets of the population leading to an elevated economic and social burden. The pathogenesis of MG is characterized by the synthesis of autoantibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4), or muscle-specific kinase at the neuromuscular junction, thereby leading to muscular weakness and fatigue. Based on clinical and laboratory examinations, the research is focused on distinguishing MG from other autoimmune, genetic diseases of neuromuscular transmission. Technological advancements in machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) have been assistive in accurate diagnosis and management. Besides, addressing the clinical needs of MG patients is critical to improving quality of life (QoL) and satisfaction. Lifestyle changes including physical exercise and traditional Chinese medicine/herbs have also been shown to exert an ameliorative impact on MG progression. To achieve enhanced therapeutic efficacy, cholinesterase inhibitors, immunosuppressive drugs, and steroids in addition to plasma exchange therapy are widely recommended. Under surgical intervention, thymectomy is the only feasible alternative to removing thymoma to overcome thymoma-associated MG. Although these conventional and current therapeutic approaches are effective, the associated adverse events and surgical complexity limit their wide application. Moreover, Restivo et al. also, to increase survival and QoL, further recent developments revealed that antibody, gene, and regenerative therapies (such as stem cells and exosomes) are currently being investigated as a safer and more efficacious alternative. Considering these above-mentioned points, we have comprehensively reviewed the recent advances in pathological etiologies of MG including COVID-19, and its therapeutic management.",

    "abstract": "Due to its extremely complex pathogenesis, no effective drugs to prevent, delay progression, or cure Alzheimer’s disease (AD) exist at present. The main pathological features of AD are senile plaques composed of β-amyloid, neurofibrillary tangles formed by hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein, and degeneration or loss of neurons in the brain. Many risk factors associated with the onset of AD, including gene mutations, aging, traumatic brain injury, endocrine and cardiovascular diseases, education level, and obesity. Growing evidence points to chronic stress as one of the major risk factors for AD, as it can promote the onset and development of AD-related pathologies via a mechanism that is not well known. The use of murine stress models, including restraint, social isolation, noise, and unpredictable stress, has contributed to improving our understanding of the relationship between chronic stress and AD. This review summarizes the evidence derived from murine models on the pathological features associated with AD and the related molecular mechanisms induced by chronic stress. These results not only provide a retrospective interpretation for understanding the pathogenesis of AD, but also provide a window of opportunity for more effective preventive and identifying therapeutic strategies for stress-induced AD.",

    "abstract": "Degenerative disc disease (DDD) is one of the most common skeletal disorders affecting aged populations. DDD is the leading cause of low back/neck pain, resulting in disability and huge socioeconomic burdens. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying DDD initiation and progression remain poorly understood. Pinch1 and Pinch2 are LIM-domain-containing proteins with crucial functions in mediating multiple fundamental biological processes, such as focal adhesion, cytoskeletal organization, cell proliferation, migration, and survival. In this study, we found that Pinch1 and Pinch2 were both highly expressed in healthy intervertebral discs (IVDs) and dramatically downregulated in degenerative IVDs in mice. Deleting Pinch1 in aggrecan-expressing cells and Pinch2 globally (AggrecanCreERT2; Pinch1fl/fl; Pinch2-/-) caused striking spontaneous DDD-like lesions in lumbar IVDs in mice. Pinch loss inhibited cell proliferation and promoted extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation and apoptosis in lumbar IVDs. Pinch loss markedly enhanced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially TNFα, in lumbar IVDs and exacerbated instability-induced DDD defects in mice. Pharmacological inhibition of TNFα signaling mitigated the DDD-like lesions caused by Pinch loss. In human degenerative NP samples, reduced expression of Pinch proteins was correlated with severe DDD progression and a markedly upregulated expression of TNFα. Collectively, we demonstrate the crucial role of Pinch proteins in maintaining IVD homeostasis and define a potential therapeutic target for DDD.",

Previously, our group and others reported elevated levels of miR-141-3p in several tissues and organs with age. Here, we inhibited the expression of miR-141-3p using antagomir (Anti-miR-141-3p) in aged mice and explored its role in healthy aging. We analyzed serum (cytokine profiling), spleen (immune profiling), and overall musculoskeletal phenotype. We found decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IFN-γ) in serum with Anti-miR-141-3p treatment. The flow-cytometry analysis on splenocytes revealed decreased M1 (pro-inflammatory) and increased M2 (anti-inflammatory) populations. We also found improved bone microstructure and muscle fiber size with Anti-miR-141-3p treatment. Molecular analysis revealed that miR-141-3p regulates the expression of AU-rich RNA-binding factor 1 (AUF1) and promotes senescence (p21, p16) and pro-inflammatory (TNF-α, IL-1β, IFN-γ) environment whereas inhibiting miR-141-3p prevents these effects. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the expression of FOXO-1 transcription factor was reduced with Anti-miR-141-3p and elevated with silencing of AUF1 (siRNA-AUF1), suggesting crosstalk between miR-141-3p and FOXO-1. Overall, our proof-of-concept study demonstrates that inhibiting miR-141-3p could be a potential strategy to improve immune, bone, and muscle health with age.",

We aimed to assess the effect of frailty (FR), oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) and malnutrition (MN) on mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 older patients. Prospective cohort study of older patients (>70 years) with COVID-19 admitted to a general hospital from April 2020 to January 2021. Patients were evaluated on admission, discharge and at 1- and 3-months follow up. FR was assessed with FRAIL-VIG, OD with Volume-Viscosity Swallowing Test and MN with GLIM criteria. Clinical characteristics and outcomes, including intra-hospital, 1- and 3-month mortality, were analyzed. 258 patients were included (82.5±7.6 years; 58.9% women); 66.7% had FR (mild 28.7%, moderate 27.1% and severe 10.9%); 65.4%, OD and 50.6%, MN.

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia is the primary cause of impaired motor performance in the elderly. The current prevailing approach to counteract such condition is increasing the muscle mass through inhibition of the myostatin system: however, this strategy only moderately improves muscular strength, not being able to sustain the innervation of the hypertrophic muscle per se, leading to a progressive worsening of motor performances. Thus, we proposed the administration of ActR-Fc-nLG3, a protein that combines the soluble activin receptor, a strong myostatin inhibitor, with the C-terminal agrin nLG3 domain. This compound has the potential of reinforcing neuro-muscular stability to the hypertrophic muscle. We previously demonstrated an enhancement of motor endurance and ACh receptor aggregation in young mice after ActR-Fc-nLG3 administration. Now we extended these observations by demonstrating that also in aged (2 years-old) mice, long-term administration of ActR-Fc-nLG3 increases in a sustained way both motor endurance and muscle strength, compared with ActR-Fc, a myostatin inhibitor, alone. Histological data demonstrate that the administration of this biological improves neuromuscular stability and fiber innervation maintenance, preventing muscle fiber atrophy and inducing only moderate hypertrophy. Moreover, at the postsynaptic site we observe an increased folding in the soleplate, a likely anatomical substrate for improved neurotransmission efficiency in the NMJ, that may lead to enhanced motor endurance. We suggest that ActR-Fc-nLG3 may become a valid option for treating sarcopenia and possibly other disorders of striatal muscles.",

    "abstract": "The aging process is associated with the development of a wide range of degenerative disorders in mammals. These diseases are characterized by a progressive decline in function at multiple levels, including the molecular, cellular, tissue, and organismal. Furthermore, it is responsible for various healthcare costs in developing and developed countries. Sarcopenia is the deterioration in the quality and functionality of muscles, which is extremely concerning as it manages many functions in the human body. This article reviews the molecular crosstalk involved in sarcopenia and the specific roles of many mediator molecules in establishing cross-talk between muscles, bone, and fatty tissues, eventually leading to sarcopenia. Besides, the involvement of various etiological factors, such as neurology, endocrinology, lifestyle, etc., makes it exceedingly difficult for clinicians to develop a coherent hypothesis that may lead to the well-organized management system required to battle this debilitating disease. The several hallmarks contributing to the progression of the disease is a vital question that needs to be addressed to ensure an efficient treatment for sarcopenia patients. Also, the intricate molecular mechanism involved in developing this disease requires more studies. The direct relationship of cellular senescence with aging is one of the pivotal issues contributing to disease pathophysiology. Some patented treatment strategies have been discussed, including drugs undergoing clinical trials and emerging options like miRNA and protein-enclosed extracellular vesicles. A clear understanding of the secretome, including the signaling pathways involved between muscles, bone, and fatty tissues, is extremely beneficial for developing novel therapeutics for curing sarcopenia.",

The maintenance of myelin and the well-organized subtle process of myelin plasticity requires cooperation among myelin-forming cells, glial cells, and neural networks. The process of cooperation is fragile, and the balance is highly susceptible to disruption by microenvironment influences. Reactive microglia play a critical and complicated role in the demyelination and remyelination process. Recent studies have shown that the voltage-gated proton channel Hv1 is selectively expressed in microglia in CNS, which regulates intracellular pH and is involved in the production of reactive oxygen species, underlying multifaceted roles in maintaining microglia function. This paper begins by examining the molecular mechanisms of demyelination and emphasizes the crucial role of the microenvironment in demyelination. It focuses specifically on the role of Hv1 in myelin repair and its therapeutic potential in CNS demyelinating diseases.",

This study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the relationships between regional brain volume ratios and CBF in healthy brains. The study participants were healthy volunteers who underwent three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI, time-of-flight MR angiography, and four-dimensional (4D) flow MRI between 2020 and 2022. The brain was automatically segmented into 21 brain subregions from 3D T1-weighted MRI, and CBF in 16 major intracranial arteries were measured by 4D flow MRI. The relationships between segmented brain volume ratios and CBFs around the circle of Willis were comprehensively investigated in each decade and sex. This study included 129 healthy volunteers (mean age ± SD, 48.2 ± 16.8; range, 22-92 years; 43 males and 86 females). The association was strongest between the cortical gray matter volume ratio and total outflow of the intracranial major arteries distal to the circle of Willis (Pearson's correlation coefficient, r: 0.425). In addition, the mean flow of the total inflow and outflow around the circle of Willis were significantly greater in women than men, and significant left-right differences were observed in CBFs even on the peripheral side of the circle of Willis. Moreover, the correlation was strongest between the left cortical gray matter volume ratio and the combined flows of the left anterior and posterior cerebral arteries distal to the circle of Willis (r: 0.486). There was a trend toward greater total intracranial CBF, especially among women in their 40s and younger, who had a larger cortical gray matter volume. This finding may be one of the reasons for the approximately twofold higher incidence of cerebral aneurysms and subarachnoid hemorrhage, and a threefold higher incidence of migraine headaches.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the impact of abdominal aortic occlusion (AAO)- induced injury on the kidney, lower limb muscles, heart, and brain in mice, and the potential protective effects of hypoxic postconditioning (HyC). The experimental design employed an abdominal aortic occlusion (AAO) model, and involved three groups of mice: sham, AAO, and AAO+HyC. Ten minutes after the AAO model, mice were subjected to hypoxic treatment lowering oxygen concentration to 5% within 45 minutes, and then returned to a normal oxygen environment. Hematoxylin- eosin (HE) stain was used for Histopathological examinations, and Quantibody Mouse Array was used for detecting apoptosis and inflammation-related protein expression. Histopathological examinations showed that HyC mitigated pathological damage to proximal organs (kidneys and lower limb muscles), distal organs (heart and brain), and reduced inflammatory cell infiltration. Expression of apoptosis- and inflammation-related proteins in brain and heart tissues were also evaluated. HyC significantly increased cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2 (cIAP2) in the brain and Bcl-2 and insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) in the heart. Additionally, HyC regulated the expression of several inflammation-related factors in both brain and heart tissues. Although further investigation is needed, particularly in human subjects, this study highlights the potential of HyC as a promising therapeutic strategy for reducing AAO-associated organ damage.",

    "abstract": "Aging is a natural process with varying effects. As we grow older, our bodies become more susceptible to aging-associated diseases. These diseases, individually or collectively, lead to the formation of distinct aging phenotypes. Identifying these aging phenotypes and understanding the complex interplay between coexistent diseases would facilitate more personalized patient management, a better prognosis, and a prolonged lifespan. Many studies distinguish between successful aging and frailty. However, this simple distinction fails to reflect the diversity of underlying causes. In this study, we sought to establish the underlying causes of frailty and determine the patterns in which these causes converge to form aging phenotypes. We conducted a comprehensive geriatric examination, cognitive assessment, and survival analysis of 2,688 long-living adults (median age = 92 years). The obtained data were clustered and used as input data for the Aging Phenotype Calculator, a multiclass classification model validated on an independent dataset of 96 older adults. The accuracy of the model was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the curve. Additionally, we analyzed socioeconomic factors that could contribute to specific aging patterns. We identified five aging phenotypes: non-frailty, multimorbid frailty, metabolic frailty, cognitive frailty, and functional frailty. For each phenotype, we determined the underlying diseases and conditions and assessed the survival rate. Additionally, we provided management recommendations for each of the five phenotypes based on their distinct features and associated challenges. The identified aging phenotypes may facilitate better-informed decision-making. The Aging Phenotype Calculator (ROC AUC = 92%) may greatly assist geriatricians in patient management.",

Deficiency of IGF-1 in humans leads to issues such as microcephaly, mental retardation, deafness, and postnatal growth failure. IGF-1 is produced in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and activates the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) in photoreceptor cells. When IGF-1R is absent in rod cells, it results in the degeneration of photoreceptors, emphasizing the neuroprotective function of IGF signaling in these cells. Contrastingly, in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), there is an overexpression of both IGF-1 and IGF-1R in RPE. The mechanisms behind this altered regulation of IGF-1 in diseased states are currently unknown. This comprehensive review provides recent insights into the role of IGF-1 in the health and disease of the retina, raising several unanswered questions that still need further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have provided links between glutamine metabolism and bone remodeling, but little is known about its role in primary osteoporosis progression. We aimed to determine the effects of inhibiting glutaminase (GLS) on two types of primary osteoporosis and elucidate the related metabolism. To address this issue, age-related and ovariectomy (OVX)-induced bone loss mouse models were used to study the in vivo effects of CB-839, a potent and selective GLS inhibitor, on bone mass and bone turnover. We also studied the metabolic profile changes related with aging and GLS inhibition in primary bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) and that related with OVX and GLS inhibition in primary bone marrow-derived monocytes (BMM). Besides, we studied the possible metabolic processes mediating GLS blockade effects during aging-impaired osteogenic differentiation and RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation respectively via in vitro rescue experiments. We found that inhibiting GLS via CB-839 prevented OVX-induced bone loss while aggravated age-related bone loss. Further investigations showed that effects of CB-839 treatment on bone mass were associated with alterations of bone turnover. Moreover, CB-839 treatment altered metabolic profile in different orientations between BMSC of aged mice and BMM of ovariectomized mice. In addition, rescue experiments revealed that different metabolic processes mediated glutaminase blockade effects between aging-impaired osteogenic differentiation and RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation. Taken together, our data demonstrated the different outcomes caused by CB-839 treatment between two types of osteoporosis in mice, which were tightly connected to the suppressive effects on both aging-impaired osteoblastogenesis and OVX-enhanced osteoclastogenesis mediated by different metabolic processes downstream of glutaminolysis.",

    "abstract": "The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) contributes to diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction (DACD) through the interaction of its C-terminal AAs 2-5 with mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3 (MKK3). However, the associated MKK3 binding site is unknown. Here, db/db mice were used as a model for type 2 diabetes. GST pull-down assays and AutoDock Vina simulations were conducted to identify the key RAGE binding site in MKK3. This binding site was mutated to investigate its effects on DACD and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The interaction of MKK3 and RAGE, the levels of inflammatory factors, and the activation of microglia and astrocytes were tested. Synaptic morphology and plasticity in hippocampal neurons were assessed via electrophysiological recordings and Golgi staining. Behavioral tests were used to assess cognitive function. In this study, MKK3 bound directly to RAGE via its lysine 329 (K329), leading to the activation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway, which in turn triggered neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction, and ultimately contributed to DACD. MKK3 mutation at K329 reversed synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits by downregulating the NF-κB signaling pathway and inhibiting neuroinflammation. These results confirm that neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction in the hippocampus rely on the direct binding of MKK3 and RAGE. We conclude that MKK3 K329 binding to C-terminal RAGE (ct-RAGE) is a key mechanism by which neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction are induced in the hippocampus. This study presents a novel mechanism for DACD and proposes a novel therapeutic avenue for neuroprotection in DACD.",

Despite ongoing research efforts, ALS remains incurable, attributed to its intricate pathogenic mechanisms. A notable feature in the pathology of ALS is the prevalence of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) proteinopathy, detected in approximately 97% of ALS cases, underscoring its significance in the disease's progression. As a result, strategies targeting the aberrant TDP-43 protein have garnered attention as a potential avenue for ALS therapy. This review delves into the existing drug screening systems aimed at TDP-43 proteinopathy and the models employed for drug efficacy validation. It also explores the hurdles encountered in the quest to develop potent medications against TDP-43 proteinopathy, offering insights into the intricacies of drug discovery and development for ALS. Through this comprehensive analysis, the review sheds light on the critical aspects of identifying and advancing therapeutic solutions for ALS.",

    "abstract": "Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), a subset of genomic transposable elements (TEs) in a broader sense, have remained latent within mammalian genomes for tens of millions of years. These genetic elements are typically in a silenced state due to stringent regulatory mechanisms. However, under specific conditions, they can become activated, triggering inflammatory responses through diverse mechanisms. This activation has been shown to play a potential role in various neurological disorders, tumors, and cellular senescence. Consequently, the regulation of ERV expression through various methods holds promise for clinical applications in disease treatment. ERVs also engage in interactions with a variety of exogenous viruses, thereby influencing the outcomes of viral infectious diseases. This article comprehensively reviews the pathogenic cascade of ERVs, encompassing activation, inflammation, associated diseases, senescence, and interplay with viruses. Additionally, it outlines therapeutic strategies targeting ERVs with the aim of offering novel research directions for understanding the relationship between ERVs and diseases, along with corresponding treatment modalities.",

We included patients who underwent FLAIR sequence and dynamic contrast MRI with intrathecal administration of contrast agent. The visibility of IFSH was quantitatively assessed by measuring the mean signal intensity of inferior frontal sulci on 2D FLAIR. The clearance function of putative mLVs was defined as the percentage change of signal unite ratio in the parasagittal dura from baseline to 4.5, 15 and 39 hours after intrathecal injection on dynamic contrast MRI. Additionally, imaging markers of cerebral small vessel disease, including white matter hyperintensities and enlarged perivascular spaces, were measured. Correlation analysis and linear regression were employed to verify the association of IFSH with the clearance function of mLVs. A total of 76 patients were included in the study. The visibility of IFSH was found to be associated with the percentage change of signal unite ratio in parasagittal dura from baseline to 15 and 39 hours in adjusted analyses. Furthermore, the visibility of IFSH was positively related to the age, scores of both periventricular and deep white matter hyperintensities, and the grade of enlarged perivascular spaces in centrum semiovale. These findings suggest that the visibility of IFSH on 2D FLAIR may serve as an indicator of clearance dysfunction of mLVs and may be implicated in the development of cerebral small vessel disease.",

    "abstract": "Iron is an essential micronutrient that is necessary for proper cognitive function. However, the dose-response relationship between body iron status and cognitive function remains unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between serum ferritin concentrations, an indicator of body iron status, and cognitive function in older adults. Based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002 in the United States, nationally representative data was collected from 2,567 adults aged 60 years and older who had objectively measured serum ferritin levels and cognitive performance. High ferritin levels were defined as a serum ferritin level >200 ng/mL in women and >300 ng/mL in men. Low ferritin levels were defined as a serum ferritin level <30 ng/mL. The digit symbol substitution test (DSST) was employed to assess cognitive function. Multivariable logistic regression analyses with survey weights were performed after the DSST was dichotomized at the median score. The weighted prevalence of adults with normal, low, and high serum ferritin levels were 73.98%, 9.12%, and 16.91%, respectively. A U-shaped association between serum ferritin concentrations and cognitive task performance was observed. After adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and C-reactive protein factors, the odds ratio (95% confidence intervals) for lower cognitive performance was 1.39 (1.11, 1.74) in adults with high ferritin levels and 1.38 (0.86, 2.22) in adults with low ferritin levels, compared with those with normal ferritin levels. The association between serum ferritin levels and lower cognitive performance was stronger in adults aged 60 to 69 years old than those aged 70 years and older. In conclusion, in a nationally representative sample of older adults in the United States, a high serum ferritin level was significantly associated with worse cognitive task performance. Thus, the relationship between low serum ferritin concentrations and cognitive task performance warrants further investigation.",

However, effective pharmaceutical interventions are lacking and the molecular mechanisms linking aging to VC remain elusive. This study explored the role of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) in age-associated VC, specifically focusing on vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) senescence. Using a chronologically aging mouse model, we noted a significant decline in the expression of NRF2 in the aged mice aortas, coinciding with increased VC. Administering NRF2 activators effectively reduced calcification. By establishing adenine-and vitamin D-induced VC models in VSMC-specific <i>Nrf2</i> knockout (<i>Nrf2<sup>SMCKO</sup></i>) mice, there was an increase in VC with increased VSMC senescence. Aortic rings and primary VSMCs from <i>Nrf2<sup>SMCKO</sup></i> mice also showed increased VC under high-phosphate conditions. Furthermore, <i>Nrf2</i> overexpression inhibited VSMC calcification with decreased VSMC senescence and an osteogenic phenotype, whereas <i>Nrf2</i> silencing aggravated calcification. Transcriptome RNA-seq analysis of the aortas from <i>Nrf2<sup>SMCKO</sup></i> and control mice revealed that inhibitor of DNA binding 2 <i>(Id2</i>) is a core downstream gene of NRF2. <i>Id2</i> overexpression alleviated <i>NRF2</i> knockdown-induced VC and VSMC senescence, while silencing <i>Id2</i> negated the protective effects of NRF2. Moreover, results of a dual luciferase reporter assay indicated that NRF2 promotes the transcriptional activity of the <i>Id2</i> gene promoter region. This study emphasizes the critical role of age-related NRF2 dysfunction in the nexus between VSMC senescence and VC. The NRF2-ID2 axis in VSMCs has been proposed as a promising therapeutic target for reducing VC and mitigating age-related cardiovascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "Aging is a multifactorial process that ultimately leads to a decline in physiological function and a consequent reduction in the health span, and quality of life in elderly population. In musculoskeletal diseases, aging is often associated with a gradual loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength, resulting in reduced functional capacity and an increased risk of chronic metabolic diseases, leading to impaired function and increased mortality. Autophagy is a highly conserved physiological process by which cells, under the regulation of autophagy-related genes, degrade their own organelles and large molecules by lysosomal degradation. This process is unique to eukaryotic cells and is a strict regulator of homeostasis, the maintenance of energy and substance balance. Autophagy plays an important role in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes such as cell homeostasis, aging, immunity, tumorigenesis and neurodegenerative diseases. On the one hand, under mild stress conditions, autophagy mediates the restoration of homeostasis and proliferation, reduction of the rate of aging and delay of the aging process. On the other hand, under more intense stress conditions, an inadequate suppression of autophagy can lead to cellular aging. Conversely, autophagy activity decreases during aging. Due to the interrelationship between aging and autophagy, limited literature exists on this topic. Therefore, the objective of this review is to summarize the current concepts on aging and autophagy in the musculoskeletal system. The aim is to better understand the mechanisms of age-related changes in bone, joint and muscle, as well as the interaction relationship between autophagy and aging. Its goal is to provide a comprehensive perspective for the improvement of diseases of the musculoskeletal system.",

We aimed to generate a model reminiscent of the etiologies related to the common late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) sporadic disease that will recapitulate AD/dementia features. Naïve female mice underwent ovariectomy (OVX) to accelerate aging/menopause and were fed a high fat-sugar-salt diet to expose them to factors associated with increased risk of development of dementia/AD. The OVX mice fed a high fat-sugar-salt diet responded by dysregulation of glucose/insulin, lipid, and liver function homeostasis and increased body weight with slightly increased blood pressure. These mice developed AD-brain pathology (amyloid and tangle pathologies), gliosis (increased burden of astrocytes and activated microglia), impaied blood vessel density and neoangiogenesis, with cognitive impairment. Thus, OVX mice fed on a high fat-sugar-salt diet imitate a non-familial sporadic/environmental form of AD/dementia with vascular damage. This model is reminiscent of the etiologies related to the LOAD sporadic disease that represents a high portion of AD patients, with an added value of presenting concomitantly AD and vascular pathology, which is a common condition in dementia. Our model can, thereby, provide a valuable tool for studying disease pathogenesis and for the development of therapeutic approaches.",

Therefore, delaying the progression of renal aging and preserving the youthful vitality of the kidney are crucial for preventing kidney diseases. However, effective strategies against renal aging are still lacking due to the underlying mechanisms of renal aging, which have not been fully elucidated. Accumulating evidence suggests that metformin has beneficial effects in mitigating renal aging. Metformin has shown promising anti-aging results in animal models but has not been tested for this purpose yet in clinical trials. These findings indicate the potential of metformin as an anti-renal aging drug. In this review, we primarily discuss the characteristics and mechanisms of kidney aging and the potential effects of metformin against renal aging.",

    "abstract": "Stroke is a serious disease that can lead to local neurological dysfunction and cause great harm to the patient's health due to blood cerebral circulation disorder. Synaptic pruning is critical for the normal development of the human brain, which makes the synaptic circuit completer and more efficient by removing redundant synapses. The complement system is considered a key player in synaptic loss and cognitive impairment in neurodegenerative disease. After stroke, the complement system is over-activated, and complement proteins can be labeled on synapses. Microglia and astrocytes can recognize and engulf synapses through corresponding complement receptors. Complement-mediated excessive synaptic pruning can cause post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) and secondary brain damage. This review summarizes the latest progress of complement-mediated synaptic pruning after stroke and the potential mechanisms. Targeting complement-mediated synaptic pruning may be essential for exploring therapeutic strategies for secondary brain injury (SBI) and neurological dysfunction after stroke.",

Thus, understanding the fundamental mechanisms of senescence is paramount for advancing preventive and therapeutic approaches to age-related conditions. Important to this pursuit is the precise identification and examination of senescent cells, contingent upon the recognition of specific biomarkers. Historically, detection methods relied on assessing molecular protein and mRNA levels and various staining techniques. While these conventional approaches have contributed substantially to the field, they possess limitations in capturing the dynamic evolution of cellular aging in real time. The emergence of novel technologies has led to a paradigm shift in senescence research. Gene-edited mouse models and the application of advanced probes have revolutionized our ability to detect senescent cells. These cutting-edge methodologies provide a more detailed and accurate means of dynamically monitoring, characterizing and potentially eliminating senescent cells, thus enhancing our understanding of the complex mechanisms of aging. This review comprehensively explores both traditional and innovative senescent cell detection methods, elucidating their advantages, limitations and implications for future investigations and could serve as a comprehensive guide and catalyst for further advancements in the understanding of aging and associated pathologies.",

However, recent studies have shown that stress also plays a crucial role in inducing cellular senescence. Stress can affect cellular function and structure through various pathways, leading to accelerated aging. Exposure to stressful conditions can alter the neuroendocrine system, activate the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathetic adrenal medullary axis, and release cortisol and catecholamines, causing mitochondrial dysfunction, generating excessive reactive oxygen species, and inducing oxidative stress, DNA damage, and inflammatory reactions, ultimately resulting in accelerated cellular senescence. The process of stress-induced cellular senescence has been implicated in a number of chronic diseases, including age-related macular degeneration, chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and obstructive sleep apnea. In this review, we integrate recent progress research progress in our understanding of the mechanisms of stress-induced cellular senescence and discuss its underlying mechanisms from the perspective of stress hormones. We review potential therapeutic targets for stress-induced premature senescence and discuss the advantages and limitations of existing pharmacological agents capable of ameliorating stress-induced premature senescence.",

    "abstract": "Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) dysfunctions have been associated to life-spam, and aging-related diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, and the neuroinflammatory associated processes. Mitochondrial dysfunctions play a major role in aging-related diseases, including dopaminergic neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. However, the mechanisms of RAS/mitochondria interactions remain to be clarified. In the present work, we studied the role of major RAS components in the mitochondrial dynamics in dopaminergic neurons and microglia using in vitro and in vivo models. In dopaminergic neurons, we observed that activation of the RAS pro-oxidative/pro-inflammatory axis (Angiotensin II/Angiotensin type-1 receptor, AT1/NADPH oxidase complex) produces a dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics towards mitochondrial fission, via Drp1 phosphorylation at Ser616 and translocation to mitochondria. However, activation of the RAS antioxidative/anti-inflammatory axis, using Angiotensin 1-7, counteracts this effect. RAS components also modulated the microglial inflammatory response through mitochondrial dynamic changes. After interferon-γ-induced activation of human microglial cells, we observed increased mitochondrial fission and superoxide production that was inhibited by Angiotensin 1-7 treatment. Angiotensin 1-7 also inhibited mitochondrial metabolic changes induced by pro-inflammatory microglial activation. The role of RAS in mitochondrial dynamic changes was confirmed in vivo using the LPS-induced inflammation model in wild-type, AT1-KO, and AT2-KO mice. The effect of Angiotensin 1-7 is mediated by IL-10, specifically by decreasing the post-transcriptional phosphorylated Drp1 form, and translocation of STAT3 to mitochondria. Angiotensin 1-7, acting on mitochondrial Angiotensin 1-7 receptors (Mas/Mas related receptors), increased the phosphorylated form of STAT3 at Ser727, which is mediated by mitochondrial PKA activation. In conclusion, the present findings show the role of RAS components in modulation of mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondrial function, revealing the associated signaling pathways. The results lead to better understanding of the effects of RAS dysfunction in aging-related diseases, and particularly dopaminergic degeneration and neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease.",

Notably, the gut microbiome affects epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone alterations. Furthermore, it contributes to the age-related decline in immune system efficiency, increasing susceptibility to infections and cancers. This dual role of the gut microbiome-both a protective factor and a risk factor-is a key aspect of its importance in maintaining long-term health, making it a significant topic of discussion in this review. Moreover, a challenge faced by the elderly is the concurrent use of multiple medications. Polypharmacy can interact with the gut microbiome, potentially altering its efficacy, leading to adverse drug reactions, and affecting vital microbiome diversity. The effects of these interactions on cancer therapies and the overall health of elderly patients are becoming increasingly important. Understanding the complex relationship between aging, the gut microbiome, cancer, and polypharmacy is crucial for developing more effective therapeutic strategies and improving patient outcomes. Here, we discuss recent advances in understanding age-related physiological changes in the microbiome and their significance in cancer development and therapy. Specifically, we will explor how epigenetic changes acquired during aging, along with ongoing prescriptions of multiple medications and the decline of immune function, contribute to the intricate relationship between aging and cancer.",

Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) accounts for 10-15% of ischemic stroke in Western societies, but is an underlying pathology in up to 54% of ischemic strokes in Asian populations. ICAD has largely been treated with medical management, although a few studies have examined outcomes following endovascular treatment. Our objective was to summarize the major trials that have been performed thus far in regard to the endovascular treatment of ICAD and to provide direction for future management of this disease process. Systematic review of the literature from 1966 to 2015, was conducted in regard to intracranial angioplasty and stenting. Studies were analyzed from PubMed, American Heart Association and Society of Neurointerventional Surgery databases. SAMMPRIS and VISSIT are the only randomized controlled trials from which Western guidelines of intracranial stenting have been derived, which have displayed the superiority of medical management. However, pooled reviews of smaller studies and other nonrandomized trials have shown better outcomes with endovascular therapy in select patient subsets, such as intracranial vertebrobasilar stenosis or in the presence of robust collaterals. Suboptimal cases, including longer lesions, bifurcations and significant tortuosity tend to fair better with medical management. Medical management has been shown to be more efficacious with less adverse outcomes than endovascular therapy. However, the majority of studies on endovascular management included a diverse patient population without ideal selection criteria, resulting in higher adverse outcomes. Population analyses and selective utilization of endovascular therapy have shown that the treatment may be superior to other management in select patients.",

    "abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that HIV infection may accelerate biological aging. Insomnia symptoms, particularly in later life, exacerbate cellular aging. We examined the association between insomnia symptoms and leukocyte telomere length (LTL), and further explored how this association was affected by HIV serostatus and age. Data were assessed from 244 HIV-infected individuals ≥40 years and 244 HIV-uninfected individuals who were frequency-matched by age, gender and education level. Insomnia symptoms were assessed by responses to four sleep-related questions covering the past month. We performed multivariable linear regression with logarithmically transformed LTL and reported exponentiated coefficients. HIV-infected individuals had shorter LTL compared to uninfected individuals (geometric mean 0.82 vs 0.89, P=0.052), and this association remained after adjustment for gender, education level, and smoking history (-7.4%, P=0.051) but markedly attenuated after additional adjustment for insomnia and depressive symptoms (-3.7%, P=0.367). Significant interactions between age group (55-82 vs 40-54 years) and insomnia symptoms on LTL were observed in the HIV-infected individuals (-28.4%, P=0.033) but not the uninfected (-17.9%, P=0.250). After stratifying by age group, LTL was independently associated with insomnia symptoms in those 55 years and older among the HIV-infected individuals (-24.5%, P=0.026) but not those 40-54 years old (-9.8%, P=0.428). Our findings suggest that elevated insomnia and depressive symptoms may partly explain the correlation between HIV serostatus and shorter LTL. Significant association between insomnia and shorter LTL observed in elderly HIV-infected but not in uninfected individuals suggest that such adverse effect may begin at an earlier age or is more pronounced in HIV-infected individuals but requires further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Liuwei Dihuang (LWDH), a famous traditional Chinese medicine, is widely used in the clinical treatment of aging-related diseases in China. However, its pharmacological mechanisms are not clear. In the present study, we evaluated the lifespan extension effect of LWDH in <i>C. elegans</i> and mice and revealed its underlying mechanisms. The results showed that LWDH significantly extended the lifespan of <i>C. elegans</i> in a dose-dependent manner. LWDH also conferred protection to nematodes against oxidative stress and reduced their fat storage. Genetics analysis and microarray data showed that the longevity effect of LWDH was attributed to the regulation of the innate immune response, proteolysis, lipid metabolism, and the oxidation-reduction process and was dependent on <i>daf-16.</i> Among the six herbs in the formula, Radix Rehmanniae Preparata and Fructus Macrocarpii contributed most to the longevity effect of this medicine, while the other four components had a synergistic effect on the longevity effect of the prescription. The lack of any single herb reduced the efficacy of the complete formula. LWDH also extended the lifespan and reduced both the weight and oxidant stress status in aged mice. Taken together, these results suggested that LWDH might function in a multi-target manner to extend the lifespan in both <i>C. elegans</i> and aged mice, and the best effect was achieved with the complete formula.",

Only recently has more attention been shifted to identifying the preserved capacity and functioning of AD patients. By reviewing the AD literature, we observe that despite the various cognitive impairment and deficits, early Alzheimer's patients perform certain types of automatic emotion regulation and display a positivity effect in emotion recognition and emotional memory.Moreover, we argue that, like their healthy aged peers, the optimization of such preserved emotion-based capacities helps early AD patients increase positive emotions, which may counteract the negative effects of the disease, thus maintaining their socio-emotional functioning. Finally, we discuss the emotion-based capacities strategies that AD patients may use to facilitate their adjustment to a life with Alzheimer's.",

    "abstract": "Post-stroke depression (PSD) is a common psychiatric complication of stroke that is associated with a poor outcome in stroke patients. Our aim was to assess the association between the serum magnesium levels and the presence of PSD in Chinese patients. Two hundred nine stroke patients were included in the study. Depressive symptoms were measured by the 17-Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression at 3 months after stroke. Based on the depressive symptoms, diagnoses of depression were made in line with the DSM-IV criteria for PSD. Serum magnesium levels were evaluated using the dimethyl aniline blue colorimetric method at admission. Multivariate analyses were conducted using logistic regression models. Further, 120 normal subjects were recruited, and their serum magnesium levels were also measured as control. At 3 months, fifty-nine patients (28.2%) were diagnosed as PSD. The serum magnesium levels were significantly lower in both PSD patients and non-PSD patients than in normal subjects (p < 0.001). Indeed, patients with PSD showed lower serum magnesium levels (p < 0.001) than did non-PSD patients at admission. In the multivariate analyses, after adjusting for potential variables, we found that an increased risk of PSD was associated with serum magnesium levels ≤ 0.84mmol/L (OR 2.614, 95% CI 1.178-5.798, p=0.018). Low serum magnesium levels at admission were found to be associated with the presence of PSD at 3 months after stroke.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fast progressing neurodegenerative disease leading to quadriplegia, anarthria and respiratory insufficiency. A large variety of phenotypes and disability progression requires individually tailored management. Identification of predictors of poor prognosis may not only improve management, but also allow for more precise patients' stratification for clinical trials or research studies. The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of emotional lability present at disease onset on ALS progression by exploring its direct impact on the decay of the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R). The study was performed in a group of 1145 patients from Germany, Poland, Portugal and Turkey between 2014 and 2018. The analysis showed that the presence of emotional lability at ALS onset was linked to a faster decline of ALSFRS-R (0.70 vs 0.50, p<0.0001), in case of either bulbar (0.80 vs 0.65, p<0.05) or limb disease onset (0.59 vs 0.46, p <0.01). It was most prominent in the bulbar subscore of ALSFRS-R. A multiple regression analysis showed a direct influence of emotional lability at ALS onset on disease progression, regardless of age, gender, site of onset, weight loss, cognitive impairment and diagnosis delay (β=0.071; p=0.019). It can therefore be concluded that the presence of emotional lability at the disease onset is an independent factor of faster disease progression in ALS.",

PD patients from the neurology outpatient clinic at Ruijin Hospital were recruited and grouped according to whether postural abnormalities (including camptocormia and Pisa syndrome) were present. PD-related scale assessments, three-dimensional gait tests and brain resting-state functional magnetic imaging were performed and analyzed. The gait characteristics independently associated with PDPA were decreased pelvic obliquity angle and progressive downward movement of the center of mass during walking. PDPA features included decreased functional connectivity between the left insula and bilateral supplementary motor area, which was significantly correlated with reduced Berg Balance Scale scores. Functional connectivity between the right insula and bilateral middle frontal gyrus was decreased and significantly correlated with a decreased pelvic obliquity angle and poor performance on the Timed Up and Go test. Moreover, through diffusion tensor imaging analysis, the average fractional anisotropy value of the fibers connecting the left insula and left supplementary motor area was shown to be decreased in PDPA. There is decreased functional connectivity among the insula, supplementary motor area and middle frontal gyrus with structural abnormalities between the left insula and the left supplementary motor area; these changes in brain connectivity are probably among the causes of gait dysfunction in PDPA and provide some clues regarding the pathogenic mechanisms of PDPA.",

The lack of a valid, accepted treatment protocol and vaccine that leads to continued treatment searches. Leng et al published their article in the Aging and Disease journal, which demonstrates that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be used for COVID-19 treatment. Adipose tissue is one of the most important MSCs sources in the body, and adipose derived stromal cells (ADSCs) from adipose tissue are also one of the most valuable components of stromal vascular fraction (SVF). Finally, Gentile and Sterodimas, have also published their article for the potential use of SVF in COVID-19 treatment in Aging and Disease journal. Their publication has been a guide in many ways. Adipose tissue-derived stromal cells have three main features: Immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and regenerative. Immunomodulator effects are used as a preventive in patients prone to disease; its anti-inflammatory effects may allow them to be used as a therapeutic during active disease period and finally regenerative effects to repair post-disease sequale. Those cells can be obtained not only enzymatically, but also mechanically with very benefits. They can be delivered not only systemically through the IV route but also to the target organ with a carrier. While suggesting any adipose tissue-derived treatment method possibility, the relation of adipose tissue COVID-19 should not be ignored. Because, COVID-19 shows its effect through ACE-2 and adipose tissue is very rich and important tissue in terms of ACE-2.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral ischemia is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Moreover, recent evidence indicates that it is a two-way street as the incidence rate of stroke is significantly higher in AD patients than those without the disease. Here we investigated the interaction of ischemic brain insults and AD in 9-month-old ApdE9 mice, which show full-blown accumulation of Aβ deposits and microgliosis in the brain. Permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (pMCAo) resulted in 36% larger infarct in ApdE9 mice compared to their wild-type (wt) controls. This was not due to differences in endothelium-dependent vascular reactivity. Treatment with human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) reduced the infarct volumes and abolished the increased vulnerability of ApdE9 mice to pMCAo induced brain ischemia. When the mice were exposed to global brain ischemia (GI), an insult of hippocampal cells, ApdE9 mice showed increased neuronal loss in CA2 and CA3 subregions compared to their wt controls. GI was associated with increased microgliosis, astrogliosis, infiltration of blood-derived monocytic cells, and neurogenesis without clear differences between the genotypes. IVIG treatment prevented the GI-induced neuron loss in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions in ApdE9 mice. IVIG treatment increased microgliosis in wt but not in ApdE9 mice. Finally, GI induced 60% reduction in the hippocampal Aβ burden in ApdE9 mice, which was not affected by IVIG treatment. The results indicate that the AD pathology with Aβ deposits and microgliosis increases ischemic vulnerability in various brain areas. Moreover, IVIG treatment may be beneficial especially in patients suffering from both acute ischemic insult and AD.",

Methods CICVD patients (aged 17 to 84 years) admitted into the Department of Neurology, Xuanwu Hospital, from July 2011 to December 2013, were consecutively recruited, and divided into ACP and non-ACP groups according to head and neck computerized tomographic (CT) angiography. Recurrences of cerebral ischemic events (CIEs) were compared between these groups after follow-up. Results A total of 117 patients were enrolled (ACP group: 69, non-ACP group: 48) and followed up for a mean of 9.86 months (range: 3-33). The average age of the ACP group was 62.88 years, with 59.4% older than 60 years; the average age of the non-ACP group was 50.29 years, with 37.5% older than 60 years. At the 6-month follow-up, the recurrence rate of CIEs in the ACP group was significantly higher than that of the non-ACP group (17.0% [7/47] and 0% [0/36], respectively; χ2 = 4.283, P = 0.046). The cumulative recurrence risk for CIEs of the ACP group was significantly higher than for the non-ACP group (P = 0.004). Multivariate Cox survival analysis showed that ACP presence was an independent risk factor for CIE recurrence for CICVD patients (relative risk [RR] = 7.803, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.827~33.319, P = 0.006). Conclusions ACP increased the recurrence risk of CIE in CICVD, and elderly CICVD patients should receive greater attention regarding the significance of ACP in recurrent CICVD.",

Maternal exposures to stress, some psychoactive drugs and alcohol, and environmental chemicals, among others, may result in functional changes in developing fetal tissues, creating a predisposition for disease in the individual as they age. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) may be mediators of both the immediate effects of exposure during development and early childhood as well as the long-term consequences of exposure that lead to increased risk and disease severity later in life. Given the prevalence of diseases with developmental origins, such as cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disorders, osteoporosis, metabolic dysfunction, and cancer, it is important to identify persistent mediators of disease risk.

    "abstract": "Existing diagnostic methods are limited to observing appearance and demeanor, even though genetic factors play important roles in the pathology of schizophrenia. Indeed, no molecular-level test exists to assist diagnosis, which has limited treatment strategies. To address this serious shortcoming, we used a bioinformatics approach to identify 61 genes that are differentially expressed in schizophrenia patients compared with healthy controls. In particular, competing endogenous RNA network revealed the important role of the gene <i>RASD2</i>, which is regulated by miR-4763-3p. Indeed, analysis of blood samples confirmed that <i>RASD2</i> is downregulated in schizophrenia patients. Moreover, positron emission tomography data collected for 44 human samples identified the prefrontal and temporal lobes as potential key brain regions in schizophrenia patients. Mechanistic studies indicated that miR-4763-3p inhibits <i>RASD2</i> by base-pairing with the 3' untranslated region of <i>RASD2</i> mRNA. Importantly, <i>RASD2</i> has been shown to interact with <i>β-arrestin2</i>, which contributes to the regulation of the DRD2-dependent <i>CREB</i> response element-binding protein pathway in the dopamine system. Finally, results obtained with a mouse model of schizophrenia revealed that inhibition of miR-4763-3p function alleviated anxiety symptoms and improved memory. The dopamine transporters in the striatal regions were significantly reduced in schizophrenia model mice as compared with wild-type mice, suggesting that inhibition of miR-4763-3p can lessen the symptoms of schizophrenia. Our findings demonstrate that miR-4763-3p may target <i>RASD2</i> mRNA and thus may serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for schizophrenia, providing a theoretical foundation for further studies of the molecular basis of this disease.",

    "abstract": "Cancer has always been a huge problem in the field of human health, and its early diagnosis and treatment are the key to solving this problem. Cancer testis antigens (CTAs) are a family of multifunctional proteins that are specifically expressed in male spermatozoa and tumor cells but not in healthy somatic cells. Studies have found that CTAs are involved in the occurrence and development of tumors, and some CTAs trigger immunogenicity, which suggests a possibility of tumor immunotherapy. The differential expression and function of CTAs in normal tissues and tumor cells can promote the screening of tumor markers and the development of new immunotherapies. This article introduces the expression of Kita-Kyushu lung cancer antigen-1 (KK-LC-1), a new member of the CTA family, in different types of tumors and its role in immunotherapy.",

Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease and is one of the most common complications of diabetes. CircRNAs are key in DN and therefore important for understanding DN pathophysiology and developing new therapeutic strategies. In the present review, we briefly introduce the characteristics and functions of circRNAs and summarize recent discoveries on how circRNAs participate in DN.

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with the formation of cerebral amyloid plaques, the main components of which are the modified Aβ molecules as well as the metal ions. Aβ isomerized at Asp7 residue (isoD7-Aβ) is the most abundant isoform in amyloid plaques. We hypothesized that the pathogenic effect of isoD7-Aβ is due to the formation of zinc-dependent oligomers, and that this interaction can be disrupted by the rationally designed tetrapeptide (HAEE). Here, we utilized surface plasmon resonance, nuclear magnetic resonance, and molecular dynamics simulation to demonstrate Zn2+-dependent oligomerization of isoD7-Aβ and the formation of a stable isoD7-Aβ:Zn2+:HAEE complex incapable of forming oligomers. To demonstrate the physiological importance of zinc-dependent isoD7-Aβ oligomerization and the ability of HAEE to interfere with this process at the organismal level, we employed transgenic nematodes overexpressing human Aβ. We show that the presence of isoD7-Aβ in the medium triggers extensive amyloidosis that occurs in a Zn2+-dependent manner, enhances paralysis, and shortens the animals' lifespan. Exogenous HAEE completely reverses these pathological effects of isoD7-Aβ. We conclude that the synergistic action of isoD7-Aβ and Zn2+ promotes Aβ aggregation and that the selected small molecules capable of interrupting this process, such as HAEE, can potentially serve as anti-amyloid therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Vascular calcification and aging often increase morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM); however, the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. In the present study, we found that Bcl-2 modifying factor (BMF) and BMF antisense RNA 1 (BMF-AS1) were significantly increased in high glucose-induced calcified and senescent vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) as well as artery tissues from diabetic mice. Inhibition of BMF-AS1 and BMF reduced the calcification and senescence of VSMCs, whereas overexpression of BMF-AS1 and BMF generates the opposite results. Mechanistic analysis showed that BMF-AS1 interacted with BMF directly and up-regulated BMF at both mRNA and protein levels, but BMF did not affect the expression of BMF-AS1. Moreover, knocking down BMF-AS1 and BMF suppressed the calcification and senescence of VSMCs, and BMF knockout (BMF-/-) diabetic mice presented less vascular calcification and aging compared with wild type diabetic mice. In addition, higher coronary artery calcification scores (CACs) and increased plasma BMF concentration were found in patients with DM, and there was a positive correlation between CACs and plasma BMF concentration. Thus, BMF-AS1/BMF plays a key role in promoting high glucose-induced vascular calcification and aging both in vitro and in vivo. BMF-AS1 and BMF represent potential therapeutic targets in diabetic vascular calcification and aging.",

    "abstract": "The concept frail elderly has been used to highlight the biological, rather than chronological, age. International and national bodies recommend that individuals over age 70 who visit healthcare facilities should be screened for frailty. There are important objections to the concept. Diagnostics: 'Frailty' is used for several completely different types of health problems. There are no useful biomarkers, but more than 60 different published rating methods for frailty, where different methods provide very different prevalence of frailty and also do not identify the same groups of elderly people. There is significant overlap between Clinical Frailty Scale- scores and activity of daily living (ADL)-scores. There is no gold standard method against which published frailty rating scales can be validated. It is unclear when, where and how often screening for frailty should occur in healthcare. Treatment: The evidence for treatment of frailty is very weak. A recent systematic overview found that the 21 included randomised, controlled studies (RCTs) were very heterogeneous as regards inclusion/exclusion criteria, how the condition of frailty was defined, what treatment was given and what health outcomes were assessed. In addition, there are often problems with the quality of the studies. The lack of a clear definition and evidence-based treatment of frailty means that it is inappropriate to introduce assessments of frailty in individual elderly patients in health care.",

    "abstract": "Declining global DNA methylation and cognitive impairment are reported to occur in the normal aging process. It is not known if DNA methylation plays a role in the efficacy of memory-enhancing therapies. In this study, aged animals were administered prelimbic cortical deep brain stimulation (PrL DBS) and/or L-methionine (MET) treatment. We found that PrL DBS and MET (MET-PrL DBS) co-administration resulted in hippocampal-dependent spatial memory enhancements in aged animals. Molecular data suggested MET-PrL DBS induced DNA methyltransferase DNMT3a-dependent methylation, robust synergistic upregulation of neuroplasticity-related genes, and simultaneous inhibition of the memory-suppressing gene calcineurin in the hippocampus. We further found that MET-PrL DBS also activated the PKA-CaMKIIα-BDNF pathway, increased hippocampal neurogenesis, and enhanced dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission. We next inhibited the activity of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) by RG108 infusion in the hippocampus of young animals to establish a causal relationship between DNMT activity and the effects of PrL DBS. Hippocampal DNMT inhibition in young animals was sufficient to recapitulate the behavioral deficits observed in aged animals and abolished the memory-enhancing and molecular effects of PrL DBS. Our findings implicate hippocampal DNMT as a therapeutic target for PrL DBS and pave way for the potential use of non-invasive neuromodulation modalities against dementia.",

    "abstract": "Aging is characterized by persistent low-grade systematic inflammation, which is largely responsible for the occurrence of various age-associated diseases. We and others have previously reported that long-lived people (such as centenarians) can delay the onset of or even escape certain major age-related diseases. Here, by screening blood transcriptome and inflammatory profiles, we found that long-lived individuals had a relatively lower inflammation level (<i>IL6</i>, <i>TNFα</i>), accompanied by up-regulation of activating transcription factor 7 (<i>ATF7</i>). Interestingly, <i>ATF7</i> expression was gradually reduced during cellular senescence. Loss of <i>ATF7</i> induced cellular senescence, while overexpression delayed senescence progress and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) secretion. We showed that the anti-senescence effects of <i>ATF7</i> were achieved by inhibiting nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling and increasing histone H3K9 dimethylation (H3K9me2). In <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, <i>ATF7</i> overexpression significantly suppressed aging biomarkers and extended lifespan. Our findings suggest that <i>ATF7</i> is a longevity-promoting factor that lowers cellular senescence and inflammation in long-lived individuals.",

Considering the global interaction of networks for cognitive performance, we hypothesized that VAN-related between-network connectivity might play a role in maintaining cognition in patients with WMH. We included 139 participants for both cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis from CIRCLE study (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03542734) between January 2014 and January 2021. Differences of VAN-related between-network connectivity were compared between normal-cognition (NC) and cognitive-impairment (CI) groups cross-sectionally, and between cognitive-decline (CD) and cognitive non-decline (CND) groups longitudinally by using t-test. False Discovery Rate was used for multiple comparison correction. The relationship between the network connectivity and WMH was tested on linear and quadratic models. Subgroup analysis of different WMH burdens were performed to test the difference of network connectivity between NC and CI groups. Among VAN-related between-network connectivity, only VAN-Visual Network (VN) connectivity was higher both in NC (n = 106) and CND (n = 113) groups versus CI (n = 33) and CD groups (n = 26), respectively. There was an inverted U-shaped relation between periventricular WMH (PWMH) burden and VAN-VN connectivity. Normal-cognition participants had higher VAN-VN connectivity among high, but not low PWMH burden subgroups. These findings suggest that the VAN-VN connectivity plays an important role in maintaining cognitive performance in WMH patients. It may serve as a unique marker for cognitive prediction and a potential target for intervention to prevent cognitive decline in WMH patients.",

    "abstract": "Prehabilitation has become a field of increasing interest over recent decades. However, few studies specifically investigated prehabilitation for older patients with cancer. The objective of this umbrella review was to summarize evidence on prehabilitation programs to identify the physical interventions that may be applied with benefit to older cancer patients who will undergo complex medical-surgical procedures. The protocol was registered in Prospero. Major databases, namely PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane, Web of Science and Prospero, were searched until summer 2020 and a second search was performed until November 2023. All systematic reviews and meta-analyses were included, dealing with the major topic of prehabilitation for older patients with cancer diagnosis. Among 1425 records (633 until 2020, 792 until November 2023), 14 reviews were selected for inclusion. According to the AMSTAR-2 checklist, the median quality score was 11 (range: 5-12). Total duration of prehabilitation ranged from 1 to 5 weeks, session duration from 20 to 50 minutes, session frequency from 3 to 6 per week. Reported program modes were aerobic and resistance exercises. Concerning the outcome measures, the functional as well as the respiratory status was significantly affected. Quality of life did not benefit significantly, but showed a positive trend. The length of hospital stay was not significantly improved in the majority of the studies. In contrast, most systematic reviews reported significantly lower numbers of total postoperative complications. Functional recovery was enhanced in half of the found reviews. Prehabilitation is a growing field, notably also in reviews focussing on oncological care for elderly patients included in this umbrella review. Aerobic and resistance exercises are the core of the majority of the programs evaluated but their characteristics (total duration, frequency) are partly heterogeneous. Prehabilitation for older patients may also include other modalities of geriatric interventions like nutritional or psychological optimization.",

Impaired autophagy, a process by which a cell breaks down and destroys damaged or abnormal proteins and other substances, contributes to AD progression. This study investigated Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1 Group D Member 1 (NR1D1) as a potential therapeutic target for modulating autophagy. We show that NR1D1 depletion significantly enhances autophagic flux and mitophagy in human cell lines as well as wildtype and AD Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) models. Our findings revealed that NR1D1 knockdown increased autophagy markers and activated the proteins Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and CTSB cathepsin B (Cathepsin B), both linked to autophagy function. In 5 familial AD mutations (5xFAD) mice, Nr1d1 knockdown restored the expression level of autophagy markers. C. elegans experiments revealed that depletion of the worm ortholog of NR1D1, nhr-85, improved neuronal mitophagy, enhanced associative memory in amyloid-β models, and extended lifespan. These findings suggest NR1D1 as a promising therapeutic target for improving cellular autophagy mechanisms in AD.",

    "abstract": "Studies have linked inhalation anesthesia and surgery to increased cognitive impairment, particularly in the elderly. Our previous research showed that isoflurane, but not desflurane, affected cognitive function in mice by modulating cyclophilin D (CypD), a key regulator of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and mitochondrial function. Both anesthetics metabolize into trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), which is associated with cognitive deficits. However, the specific role of CypD in the TFA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cognitive impairments is unclear. This study aims to explore the interaction between TFA, CypD, and cognitive function in neurons and mice. TFA was administered to 2-3-month-old wild-type (WT) and CypD knockout (KO) female and male mice at 120 μg/kg and to primary cultured neurons from these mice at 10 μM. Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analyses assessed the impact of TFA on the levels of CypD, voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and caspase-3 activation in neurons, along with cognitive function assessments in mice. The data from the present study demonstrated cognitive impairments in mice following TFA treatment. Elevated CypD and ROS levels were observed post-TFA exposure, alongside the TFA-induced caspase-3 activation in WT neurons and mice. Notably, the absence of CypD significantly mitigated these effects. The findings suggest that TFA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, caspase-3 activation, and subsequent cognitive impairments rely on CypD expression, particularly in the hippocampus of mice. This study illuminates the molecular pathways influenced by anesthesia-related compound TFA and its impact on cognitive function.",

One of the most extensively studied biological pathways is the gut-brain axis, which has been shown to reverse neurological disorders. Evidence from animal-based studies of dysbiosis suggest complex behavioral changes, such as alterations in sociability and anxiety, can be modulated through gut microbiota. Specifically, mental disorders include major depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Gastrointestinal diseases can be reversed by modulating gut microbiota. Dementia and its related mechanisms are also amenable to modulation of the gut microbiota. This review focuses on the role of gut microbiota in dementia by discussing the effects on depressive symptoms, cognitive function, mood, behavioral changes, chronic stress, and the prospects of the microbiota-gut-brain axis for dementia. Although animal models have revealed promising approaches for treating dementia through the modulation of the gut microbiota, it may be premature to incorporate these interventions into standard clinical practice. The heterogeneity of findings from clinical trials and randomized control trials has yet to convincingly demonstrate the efficacy of modulation in reversing dementia and its related complications.",

    "abstract": "In clinical practice, antiplatelet, anticoagulant and fibrinolytic drugs are the mainstay of thrombosis treatment, but their potential bleeding side effects limit their widespread use. Therefore, modifying these existing drugs or developing new therapies that mitigate bleeding risks while maintaining their efficacy and utilization is necessary. Since the critical role of platelets in thrombosis is closely related to their cell surface receptors, intracellular signaling pathways and metabolism, current research focuses on these three major classes of platelet targets to develop new antithrombotic drugs. The coagulation cascade has always been the main target of anticoagulant drugs, but since the role of molecules of the contact system is more critical in thrombosis than in hemostasis, molecules targeting the contact system, such as FXIa and FXIIa, have become the main direction of anticoagulant drug research at present. Moreover, since the inflammatory response has been found to be significantly associated with thrombosis in recent years, the development of drugs that target inflammatory pathways, such as inflammasome, has also become a hot topic. This article provides a detailed description of these targets or drug formulations that are currently being investigated, including their mode of action and antithrombotic efficiency, and also points out their existing shortcomings. Moreover, antithrombotic nanomedicines can achieve precise release of drugs, which can greatly improve the thrombolytic efficiency and reduce side effects. In conclusion, this review focuses on summarizing the current new targets and new methods of antithrombotic drug research, hoping to provide a little reference for future related research.",

    "abstract": "As populations age, sarcopenia increasingly impacts healthcare due to its associations with morbidity, mortality, and cognitive decline. This study is a cross-sectional analysis of prospectively collected data from 140 older adults hospitalized in an internal medicine department. Sarcopenia was measured by handgrip strength, and cognitive function by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). Sarcopenic patients (n=78) had lower DSST scores (p=0.003) and Norton scores (p&;lt0.001) compared to non-sarcopenic patients. Handgrip strength showed a significant positive correlation with DSST scores (R=0.26, p=0.0019), persisting after adjustments for age and sex (R=0.42, p=1.7e-07). This study underscores a significant association between sarcopenia and cognitive decline in hospitalized older adults, advocating for routine sarcopenia and cognitive assessments upon admission. These findings emphasize the importance of identifying at-risk patients early and developing targeted interventions. Future research should further explore underlying mechanisms and validate findings in broader cohorts.",

    "abstract": "N6-Methyladenosine (m6A), a prevalent and dynamically regulated chemical modification, has recently emerged as a crucial post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression, and affected diverse eukaryotic biological processes. However, the role of m6A modification in aging research was still rarely reported. Herein, we uncovered that both the m6A modification level and the expression level of the methyltransferase METTL3 were significantly elevated during the aging process, as observed in the physiological aging mouse model in vivo, and the cellular senescence model in vitro. Furthermore, the silencing of METTL3 staved off the senescent phenotype of MEF cells, as evidenced by the downregulation of p16, decreased β-galactosidase activity and enhanced cell proliferative capacity, while METTL3 overexpression accelerated cellular senescence. Subsequently, a METTL3 transgenic mouse was generated, which exhibited a more pronounced senescence phenotype and a shortened lifespan. To deepen into the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of m6A and METTL3 in the aging process, high-throughput MeRIP sequencing was performed on young and senescent MEFs, and identified ITGA9 as a critical downstream m6A target, which might be negatively regulated by m6A modification or METTL3 through translation inhibition. And loss- or gain-of-function experiments unveiled that ITGA9 remarkably delayed the senescence of MEF cells. Additionally, the inhibition of ITGA9 reversed the impact of METTL3 silencing on delaying senescence, while ITGA9 overexpression counteracted the effect of ectopic expression of METTL3 on advancing cellular senescence. In aggregate, our data suggested that METTL3 promoted cellular senescence by m6A-dependent translational suppression of ITGA9, which was of great significance to alleviate the organismal aging process and age-related diseases.",

Optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) is a GTPase primarily on the inner mitochondrial membrane, related to mitochondrial dynamics and cellular energy metabolism. Here, we found that decreased OPA1 expression and defective mitochondrial morphology in microglia during AD. Next, we utilized an OPA1 activator BGP-15, an OPA1 inhibitor myls22 and an OPA1 overexpression virus to investigate the role of OPA1 in AD. Our findings demonstrate that OPA1 promotes ATP production and Aβ clearance by microglia, leading to improved cognitive function. This may relate to down-regulation of hexokinase-2 (HK2) expression. These results suggest a critical role for OPA1 in Aβ clearance by microglia and a promising new direction for therapeutic approaches in AD.",

This study aimed to investigate the effects of AH on cholinergic cells in these nuclei and to test whether hypoxic preconditioning (HPC)-a previously established neuroprotective therapy-could prevent cholinergic cell loss, cognitive dysfunction, and hippocampal synaptic dysfunction in mice exposed to AH. We found that cholinergic cell loss occurred in the MS/DB after AH. HPC prevented this effect and also improved AH-induced cognitive dysfunction and hippocampal synaptic dysfunction. Overall, our findings highlight the significant role of cholinergic cells in AH-induced memory impairments and suggest that the preservation of cholinergic cell viability may provide a mechanism by which HPC improves memory impairments and preserves the function of memory-processing brain structures after AH.",

In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the physiological roles of lysosomes and their association with aging. At the cellular level, lysosomal dysfunction and cellular senescence show strong correlations. Herein, we elucidated the precise mechanisms by which lysosomal dysfunction contributes to various cellular physiological processes, as well as its potential implications in age-related hallmarks.

Neurofilament-Light chain (NfL) and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) are promising blood-based markers for neurodegenerative diseases and potential candidates for delirium. This study explored their role as blood-based risk markers for POD in older patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. In this prospective multicohort study, preoperative blood and intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected from patients aged ≥65 years with hip fractures. POD was assessed daily using the 4AT scale. NfL and GFAP concentrations in both blood and CSF were compared between POD and Non-POD groups, further stratifying by dementia status. Logistic regression models adjusted for covariates were used to assess associations. A total of 143 patients (median age, 85 years; 76.9% female) were included, with POD occurring in 38 patients (26.6%). Blood NfL and GFAP concentrations were significantly higher in the POD group than in Non-POD (64.55 vs. 44.6 pg/mL and 22 vs. 14.8 pg/mL, P&;lt0.001). CSF NfL levels were also elevated in POD (2154 vs. 1565 pg/mL, P=0.007), but no significant difference was observed for CSF GFAP levels. Higher preoperative blood NfL and GFAP levels independently predicted POD after adjusting for age, sex, dementia, frailty, and Interleukin-6 (Odds Ratio, OR: 3.21, 95% Confidence Interval, CI: 1.26-8.21, and OR: 3.66, 95% CI: 1.38-9.68, respectively).

    "abstract": "Aging is characterized by cellular senescence and increased susceptibility to age-related diseases. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology demonstrates the potential to reverse aging hallmarks, including telomere attrition, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress. Reprogramming somatic cells using factors such as Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (OSKM) restores pluripotency and reverses aging markers. Partial reprogramming, involving transient OSKM expression, rejuvenates cells by resetting epigenetic clocks, reducing senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASPs), and improving mitochondrial function, as evidenced by lifespan extension in progeroid mouse models. These advancements facilitate disease modeling and autologous therapies for neurodegeneration, etc. Critical challenges, including tumorigenicity risks associated with oncogenic reprogramming factors, have been mitigated through non-integrative delivery systems (e.g., mRNA, small molecules) and suicide genes. Persistent epigenetic memory and incomplete reprogramming impede iPSC differentiation, but CRISPR-based tools (e.g., dCas9-DNMT3A, CRISPRoff) allow precise epigenetic editing to erase residual somatic signatures. Variability in iPSC quality, influenced by cell source and culture conditions, necessitates standardized protocols and CRISPR-enhanced quality control. Ethical considerations, such as informed consent and genetic discrimination, highlight the need for governance frameworks that align innovation with societal values. Subsequent priorities include optimizing reprogramming efficiency, validating safety in preclinical models, and translating findings into therapies for age-related disorders. In conclusion, iPSC and CRISPR technologies collectively present transformative strategies to delay aging and restore cellular vitality, paving the way for rejuvenation therapies. Future studies should focus on improving the reprogramming efficiency, minimizing the risk of tumorigenicity, and exploring the optimized CRISPR-based epigenetic editing technique.",

While Pd supplementation has been shown to alleviate cancer and inflammatory diseases, its ability to mitigate the decline associated with aging remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that postbiotic Pd supplementation induces multiple beneficial effects in 18- and 26-month-old mice following three months of treatment. Pd-treated mice exhibit lower blood glucose levels and increased ketone body production. In the gut, Pd reduces colon shortening observed in aged control mice and decreases the inflammatory mediator NFκB, in the colonic mucosa. Microbiome analysis further reveals enhanced gut microbiota diversity in Pd-supplemented mice. Additionally, FITC-dextran permeability assays indicate improved intestinal barrier function. Cell culture experiments in HCT116 colon cell line show that Pd reduces oxygen consumption and promotes mitochondrial networking, accompanied by upregulation of PGC1α and CHOP, suggesting a mitohormetic response. Beyond metabolic and gut-related benefits, Pd supplementation enhances skeletal muscle strength in both 18- and 26-month-old mice. Proteomic analysis of gastrocnemius muscle reveals that Pd increases the expression of mitochondrial proteins associated with mitochondrial fitness and survival. Notably, Pd-supplemented mice challenged with a high-fat diet gain weight at a slower rate, while maintaining better skeletal muscle coordination and strength. In summary, our findings suggest that postbiotic Pd supplementation enhances metabolic health, reduces inflammation, improves mitochondrial function, and preserves muscle strength in aged mice. These results position Pd as a promising therapeutic tool for promoting healthy aging and combating aging-related diseases.",

This study investigates the association between Aβ, microglia and PAM with cognitive performance in 75 older adults, 39 with normal cognition and 36 with AD. Postmortem brain samples containing the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) underwent duplex immunohistochemistry for ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA1) and Aβ. A machine learning pipeline quantified parameters of Aβ, microglia and PAM expression. This study evaluated sex- and layer-specific patterns of expression of these parameters and the relationship with global cognitive performance, as measured by the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Additionally, four specific cognitive domains, memory, executive function, language, and visuospatial processing, were evaluated. Aβ and PAM were significantly higher in AD, with no sex- or layer-specific differences. In layers 3 and 4, Aβ plaque size was inversely correlated with MMSE. In all layers, total and activated microglial densities were related to executive function, but in a cognitive status-dependent manner. In layers 5 and 6, higher PAM expression correlated with lower CASI and MMSE scores. PAM expressions in layers 3, 5, and 6 were negatively associated with memory scores. This study characterizes Aβ, microglia, and PAM patterns in the MTG, revealing layer-specific associations between histopathological metrics and cognitive domains. It also highlights PAM as a potential therapeutic target to mitigate cognitive decline in AD.",

The main risk factors were impaired functionality (OR:2.24-12.7), aging (OR:1.05-5.16) and malnutrition (OR:2.46-5.16). Comorbidities, respiratory disease, neurological impairments, geriatric syndromes and pharmacological treatments were also significantly associated with OD (OR:1.02-15.52). The quality of the included studies and variables was mainly moderate. OD is a geriatric syndrome associated with several risk factors across multiple phenotypes of older patients. These findings highlight the critical need for early identification and targeted prevention of key risk factors for OD to improve clinical outcomes and reduce the burden of this underdiagnosed geriatric syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Futile recanalization is a recognized challenge in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients after endovascular treatment (EVT). Our purpose was to develop and validate a predictive model for futile recanalization after EVT by integrating arterial-venous collateral assessment with clinical parameters. This study included 392 AIS patients with acute anterior circulation large vessel occlusion who underwent EVT (March 2016-June 2024). Patients were stratified into training (n = 160), internal validation (n = 69), and completely independent external validation (n = 163) cohorts collected from a separate medical center. Predictors were identified using Boruta algorithm and LASSO regression. Multiple machine learning models were evaluated through discrimination, calibration, and decision curve analyses, with SHAP analysis for feature importance. Three independent predictors were identified: age (OR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.02-1.11), whole-brain arterial collateral status (OR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.18-0.50), and whole-brain venous collateral status (OR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.67-0.90). The model demonstrated excellent discrimination in the training cohort (AUC: 0.914, 95% CI: 0.866-0.963), internal validation cohort (AUC: 0.918, 95% CI: 0.844-0.991), and notably maintained robust performance in the completely independent external validation cohort (AUC: 0.755, 95% CI: 0.678-0.832). Calibration plots showed good agreement between predicted and observed outcomes. SHAP analysis further confirmed the importance of arterial and venous collateral status assessments. The integration of whole-brain arterial-venous collateral assessment with clinical parameters shows potential value in predicting futile recanalization after EVT. This model, validated across multiple cohorts, may provide additional information to support clinical decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Glucose is the primary energy source for the brain, and its continuous supply is essential for neuronal function. Astrocytes play a pivotal role in brain energy metabolism by mediating glucose uptake, sensing metabolic fluctuations, and modulating synaptic activity. However, astrocyte responses to transient glucose deprivation remain incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that astrocytic glucose uptake is crucial for network adaptation to metabolic stress. Using electrophysiology and calcium imaging approaches, we show that glucose deprivation depresses hippocampal synaptic transmission through an astrocyte-dependent mechanism that involves decreased glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1)-facilitated extracellular glucose uptake, intracellular calcium elevations, and ATP/adenosine-mediated signaling, which leads to excitatory neurotransmission depression via A1 receptors. Moreover, astrocyte-specific GLUT1 depletion prevents astrocytic responses to glucose deprivation and precludes the effects of glucose deprivation on synaptic transmission, thereby indicating that GLUT1-dependent glucose uptake is involved in astrocyte-mediated modulation of synaptic function. These findings extend the concept of astrocytic metabolic regulation beyond regions canonically classified as glucose-sensing and establish astrocytes as key integrators of energy availability and synaptic function. Our study provides new insights into the role of astrocytes in brain energy homeostasis and identifies potential therapeutic targets for metabolic disorders affecting the nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by sarcopenia is an emerging clinical challenge in aging populations, characterized by coexisting metabolic dysfunction and the progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and function. This comorbidity substantially elevates the risk of frailty, functional impairment, and poor clinical outcomes, highlighting the urgent need for targeted therapeutic interventions. Growing evidence suggests that gut microbiota dysbiosis contributes to the pathogenesis of both Type 2 diabetes mellitus and sarcopenia through mechanisms such as chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, and mitochondrial and autophagic dysfunction. Among gut-derived metabolites, short-chain fatty acids exert anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing effects and also promote muscle metabolism and mitochondrial function. Notably, exercise increases the abundance of short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria, thereby elevating circulating short-chain fatty acid levels and contributing to improved glucose homeostasis and skeletal muscle function. This review summarizes the effects of various exercise modalities on short-chain fatty acid production and explores the mechanisms by which short-chain fatty acids mediate the benefits of exercise in Type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated by sarcopenia, emphasizing their potential as novel therapeutic targets for integrated disease management.",

    "abstract": "Stroke is a known risk factor for dementia. Most Alzheimer's patients exhibit mixed neuropathology, with evidence of both ischemic damage and amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque accumulation. Breathing disorders, such as apnea, are also associated with cognitive dysfunction and dementia progression. We hypothesized that stroke exacerbates respiratory dysfunction and cognitive impairment in Tg-SwDI mice, a model of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Female CAA mice (11-13 months old) underwent permanent distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (pd-MCAO) surgery, with age- and sex-matched wild-type and sham-operated controls. Cognitive assessments included the Barnes maze, and novel object recognition test (NORT). Respiratory metrics were quantified using whole-body plethysmography, while immunohistochemistry measured Aβ deposition in the hippocampus and cortex, astrocytic markers (C3⁺GFAP⁺ for A1; S100A10⁺GFAP⁺ for A2) in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), and lymphatic vessel area (LYVE1) in deep cervical lymph nodes (dCLNs). Aβ in cerebrospinal fluid was also assessed. CAA mice without stroke exhibited higher apnea rates and impaired cognitive performance compared to wild-type controls. Stroke further increased apnea events and worsened Barnes maze escape latencies in CAA mice. Molecular analysis revealed an increase in GFAP as well as in A1 astrocytes and a reduction in A2 astrocytes in the RTN following stroke. Additionally, stroke accelerated Aβ deposition in the hippocampus and cortex while reducing Aβ clearance via cerebrospinal fluid and dCLNs. These findings suggest that stroke exacerbates respiratory dysfunction, impairs glymphatic-lymphatic clearance, and accelerates cognitive decline in CAA mice. Targeting post-stroke respiratory dysfunction may offer therapeutic potential for mitigating ischemic damage in dementia patients.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder primarily characterized by cognitive decline; however, its pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. In recent years, the role of lactate metabolism and its derived lactylation modifications in AD has received increasing attention. As a product of glycolysis, lactate is not only a key molecule in energy metabolism but also regulates gene expression and protein function through lactylation modifications. Studies have shown that in the brains of AD patients, glucose metabolism is significantly reduced, while glycolysis is upregulated, and lactate levels are elevated. Nevertheless, the research regarding the relationship between lactylation and AD remains limited. Building on recent advances in understanding lactylation in neurodegenerative diseases and related conditions, we analyze and explore the potential relationships between lactylation and AD from the perspectives of β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, tau protein pathology, and neuroinflammation. In summary, lactylation, as a novel post-translational modification holds significant promise in elucidating the pathological mechanisms and advancing the treatment of AD. A deeper investigation into its molecular mechanisms and regulatory networks may open new avenues for the diagnosis and treatment of AD.",

This process entails the routine phagocytosis of shed photoreceptor outer segments (POS) by the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Phagocytosis of POS by RPE is a highly circadian-regulated process that is dependent on intricate and tightly controlled cellular signaling pathways. This article provides a systematic review of the research on the regulation and functional implications of the RPE phagocytic signaling system. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the role of retinal pigment epithelial phagocytosis in the pathogenesis of retinal degeneration can inform the development of potential therapeutic targets to prevent the irreversible loss of retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptor cells, thereby preventing retinal degenerative diseases. This article summarizes the soluble and membrane-bound molecules produced by the RPE that are associated with phagocytosis and discusses their specific roles in POS phagocytosis and retinal degenerative disorders, potentially aiding in the prevention or treatment of retinal degenerative diseases.",

To date, the underlying pathogenesis of AD has not been comprehensively elucidated, and advancements in drug development for this disease have been relatively slow. Astrocytes are crucial for maintaining the homeostasis of the brain microenvironment. Astrocyte dysfunction has been closely linked to AD onset and progression. The Rac1 protein, which belongs to the Rho GTPase family, exhibits hyperactivation in the astrocytes of AD model mice. Nevertheless, the exact role of Rac1 in the pathogenesis of AD remains ambiguous. The TLR4/Rac1/NLRP3 signaling pathway is involved in diverse cellular activities and inflammatory responses and plays a significant role in the AD neuroinflammatory process. This review explores the mechanism of action of Rac1 in astrocytes in the context of AD and how the TLR4/Rac1/NLRP3 pathway influences the pathological process, offering novel theoretical foundations and potential therapeutic targets for preventing and treating this disease.",

Furthermore, selected fundamental principles concerning cellular ageing will be presented to elucidate how this process contributes to the comprehension of tumorigenesis. As humans age, there is a progressive decline in physiological functions, which significantly increases the risk of cancer. Epigenetic alterations-heritable yet reversible modifications of the genome without changes in DNA sequence-play a pivotal role in both ageing and tumorigenesis. Age-associated epigenetic drift, involving widespread DNA methylation changes, histone modification shifts, and chromatin remodelling, disrupts normal gene regulatory networks, leading to genomic instability and impaired cellular homeostasis. Additionally, the accumulation of senescent cells, driven by epigenetic dysregulation, fosters a pro-inflammatory environment that can promote tumorigenesis. Moreover, the epigenetic landscape of aged tissues resembles that of cancerous tissues, suggesting that ageing establishes a permissive environment for malignant transformation. Understanding the interplay between ageing, epigenetic regulation, and cancer is critical for the development of preventive strategies and novel therapeutics. Epigenetic reprogramming technologies, aiming to restore youthful epigenetic states, hold promise for delaying ageing and reducing cancer incidence. However, challenges remain in selectively targeting pathogenic epigenetic changes without disrupting essential cellular functions.",

The lack of disease-modifying therapies highlights the need for insights into the etiology and pathogenesis of PD. Mitochondrial dysfunction is recognized to be a significant contributor to disease pathogenesis, resulting in bioenergetic deficits and subsequent neurodegeneration. Research indicates that changes in non-oxidative phosphorylation (non-OXPHOS) metabolism in PD may serve as an adaptive response to mitochondrial dysfunction, compensating for energetic failure and alleviating disease progression. This review explores mitochondrial dysfunction-driven alterations in non-OXPHOS metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, emphasizing their role in maintaining energy metabolism and their dual contribution to neuroprotection and disease progression. Advances in neuroimaging techniques are also discussed, particularly their role in visualizing metabolic changes in vivo and their potential utility in identifying non-OXPHOS metabolism as a biomarker of mitochondrial dysfunction. By enhancing our understanding of the complex interplay between metabolic pathways in PD, this review underscores the importance of personalized therapeutic approaches that consider individual metabolic variations. Ultimately, these insights aim to pave the way for improved diagnostic utility and personalized treatment strategies that address the metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunctions underlying PD pathogenesis.",

This study aims to investigate whether plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels can serve as a predictive biomarker for short-term cognitive response to multidomain interventions in elderly individuals with MCI, stratified by probable amyloid-β plaque deposition. In this 24-week multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT; SUPERBRAIN-MEET), 300 elderly participants with MCI were enrolled. Probable amyloid status was determined using a plasma phosphorylated tau 181 cutoffs derived from a validated cohort. Multivariable linear regression analyses were employed to assess the association between plasma GFAP levels and percentage changes in Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) scores, stratified by amyloid deposition status and intervention group. Higher plasma GFAP levels at baseline and 6 months were independently and significantly associated with smaller percentage improvements in RBANS scores over 6 months. Among participants with probable amyloid positivity who underwent the multidomain intervention, increased baseline GFAP levels were significantly associated with reduced cognitive improvement compared to those with lower levels (β = -8.661, p = 0.040). This post hoc exploratory subanalysis, based on data from a multicenter RCT, suggests that plasma GFAP may serve as a biomarker for early cognitive stage transitions in elderly individuals with MCI.

A decline in CVH has been associated with various adverse health outcomes, but its role in impaired lower-extremity function (ILEF), a major contributor to disability, diminished quality of life and mortality in older adults, is unknown. Therefore, we examined the cross-sectional and prospective association between CVH and lower-extremity function. Using data from 2,487 individuals aged ≥65y from the Seniors-ENRICA-2 cohort, we estimated CVH at baseline using the American Heart Association's Life's Essential 8 (LE8) score (range 0 to 100, with higher values indicating better CVH). We assessed ILEF at baseline and at 2.4-year and 5.2-year follow-ups using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Statistical analyses were conducted with logistic regression with adjustment for the main confounders. ILEF was present in 26.8% of participants at baseline (666 events). The cumulative incidence over 2.4 and 5.2 years was 24.8% (278 events) and 22.5% (157 events), respectively. A 10-point higher LE8 score at baseline was associated with lower prevalence of ILEF (SPPB ≤9) at baseline (odds ratio [OR] 0.75, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69-0.80), and lower risk of incident ILEF over 2.4 years (OR 0.77, 95% CI: 0.68-0.87) and 5.2 years (OR 0.76, 95% CI: 0.65-0.89). Physical activity, glucose levels, body mass index and nicotine exposure stood out as major contributors to the lower risk of incident ILEF associated with a higher LE8 score. A higher LE8 score was associated with both a lower prevalence and incidence of ILEF in older adults. Comprehensive evaluation of CVH offers insight into older adults' lower-extremity function and how it may progress over time, identifying opportunities for early intervention.",

    "abstract": "The Cognitive Functions Dementia (CFD) is a computerized battery to assess the cognitive domains included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria for neurocognitive disorders. We aimed at examining the psychometric properties and the clinical validity of the CFD for neurocognitive disorders. Psychometric characterization was conducted in healthy individuals, stratified according to age, sex, and education to represent a norming sample. Analyses included structural validity and measurement invariance, assessed through confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) and multi-group CFA, as well as internal consistency, and re-test reliability of the battery index values. Patients with major or minor neurocognitive disorder contributed data to compute receiver operating characteristics to assess diagnostic accuracy of the CFD indices relative to healthy participants. Data from 422 healthy volunteers and 81 patients were collected for the study. The confirmatory factor analysis model confirmed the validity of the structure proposed for CFD, with the five cognitive domains (attention, verbal long-term memory, expressive language, executive functions, and perceptual motor functions) describing an overall factor (CFD-Index). Good to excellent values of internal consistency and of re-test reliability were obtained for all indices. Importantly, CFD indexes were accurate in discriminating patients with neurocognitive disorders from healthy participants. The CFD battery is a valid and reliable computerized instrument to characterize patients with neurocognitive dysfunction.",

By integrating multi-level and multi-dimensional data, emerging technologies can comprehensively analyze the complex mechanisms of aging and fibrosis diseases, discover new biomarkers and therapeutic targets, and promote the development of precision medicine. Most of the current reviews still focus on the molecular mechanisms of cellular senescence and fibrosis diseases, but lack a comprehensive summary of anti-aging drugs for the treatment of fibrosis-related diseases, and emerging technologies and integrated analysis of multi-omics data. This review discusses the latest evidence on the role of cellular senescence in tissue fibrosis, especially lungs, liver, and kidney fibrosis. In addition, we also introduce the application of anti-aging strategies in fibrotic diseases, especially drugs to eliminate senescent cells, and the latest application of emerging technologies in aging and fibrotic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Evidence hints that the cerebro-renovascular pathway could offer promising approaches to enhancing renal health and reducing the associated risk and burden of intracranial arterial calcification (IAC), a crucial marker for ageing-related intracranial atherosclerosis. This study explored whether renal function and renovascular haemodynamic metrics could predict the severity and load of IAC and elucidate the clinical distinctiveness between intimal and medial IAC. Seventy-seven Chinese participants were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Kidney functions were evaluated using the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Renovascular haemodynamics (on resistance) was assessed using duplex ultrasound to record metrics such as the resistive index (RI) of renal and interlobar arteries. Non-enhanced computed tomography (CT) assessed the count, severity, and load of IAC and classified IAC into intimal and medial. Regression models were fitted for analyses. Among 69 patients with IAC, 29% exhibited predominantly intimal and 71% predominantly medial calcification. Of those with IAC, 26 (37.7%) had an eGFR below 60 ml/min/1.73m?, 19 (27.5%) had values between 60-90 ml/min/1.73m?, and 24 (34.8%) had scores above 90 ml/min/1.73m?. Measures of eGFR &;lt60 ml/min/1.73m? were independently associated with higher renal RI [adjusted OR=3.45 (95%CI: 1.38-8.59, p=.008)]. Patients with predominantly medial IAC had higher renovascular resistance. Higher renal RI independently predicted higher IAC load [adjusted OR=1.88 (95%CI: 1.06-3.35, p=0.032)]. In summary, renovascular haemodynamics significantly determine the load and severity of IAC, particularly in individuals with reduced renal function (eGFR &;lt60 ml/min/1.73m?). The impact of renal impairment is more pronounced on medial IAC than on intimal IAC.",

    "abstract": "Cancer remains a formidable global health burden owing to its persistently high incidence and mortality, highlighting the need to elucidate its underlying biological mechanisms. Such insights are crucial for refining diagnostic precision and therapeutic efficacy. Notably, human tumors represent highly heterogeneous ecosystems, comprising a dynamic interplay between malignant cells and non-malignant components, such as immune infiltrates and stromal elements. This cellular heterogeneity constitutes a major obstacle in tumor research. Recent technological advancements have enabled the development and application of novel tools for investigating tumor heterogeneity. In this context, single-cell sequencing technologies emerged as transformative tools for dissecting tumor architecture at a cellular resolution, offering unprecedented insights into the cellular diversity and molecular underpinnings of cancer. In particular, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been widely used to analyze the tumor microenvironment, particularly its immune components, thereby providing a valuable framework for understanding tumor-immune system interactions. However, the intrinsic heterogeneity of tumor cells has received comparatively less attention, with limited studies focusing on these malignant populations. Comprehensive profiling of tumor cells has become increasingly feasible as scRNA-seq technologies continue to evolve, offering higher throughput, increased cell capture efficiency, and more advanced analytical pipelines. Despite these advancements, current applications of scRNA-seq remain primarily focused on immune and stromal cell populations. Therefore, a paradigm shift is warranted, redirecting the investigative focus toward tumor cells and gaining deeper insights into tumorigenesis and therapeutic vulnerabilities.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF), one of the most common cardiac arrhythmias, has significantly increased, especially within the aging population. Atrial fibrosis, a hallmark of the structural changes seen in AF, is characterized by abnormal activation and proliferation of atrial fibroblasts accompanied by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix. The initiation and progression of fibrosis are regulated by multiple profibrotic cytokines, with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) serving as the primary mediator. Elevated expression and activation of TGF-β are frequently observed in myocardial diseases, where it drives myofibroblast differentiation, migration, and collagen production via the Smad-dependent and Smad-independent pathways. These fibrotic alterations disrupt normal atrial electrical conduction, thereby facilitating the onset and progression of AF. This review summarizes the role of TGF-β-mediated fibrotic remodeling in AF pathogenesis and treatment. We explored the molecular mechanisms underlying TGF-β signaling in atrial fibrosis, evaluated its potential as a predictive biomarker for AF and recurrence after ablation, and discussed therapeutic strategies targeting this pathway. Increasing evidence from studies on natural and synthetic TGF-β inhibitors highlights the potential of modulating this signaling cascade to attenuate fibrosis and enhance clinical outcomes. Our review underscores the pivotal role of TGF-β signaling in AF development and supports its potential as a promising target for therapeutic intervention capable of improving the efficacy of antiarrhythmic treatments.",

    "abstract": "Different studies have demonstrated that the progression from mild to severe calcific aortic stenosis (CAS) is faster in patients with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Hence, we set out to find markers to improve the clinical management of individuals with both pathologies. Calcified and non-calcified valve tissue from patients with CAS, or with CAS and T2DM, was studied using a multiomics (proteomics and transcriptomics) strategy, highlighting the apolipoprotein CII (apoC2) protein as a potential biomarker. To define its diagnostic potential, we used ELISA and turbidimetry to measure the apoC2 in plasma from an independent cohort of patients. Moreover, an in vitro model of aortic valve interstitial cells (VICs) was used to evaluate the therapeutic potential of apoC2. This multiomics study demonstrated the increase in apoC2 protein and APOC2 gene expression in the valves of patients without T2DM. These changes were also reflected in their plasma, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic marker. Finally, exposure to recombinant apoC2 augments calcification and lipid deposition in VICs, effects that were dampened by silencing its expression, emphasizing the potential of apoC2 as therapeutic target. While the existence of T2DM affects the profile of the aortic valve, we have identified apoC2 as a potential diagnostic and therapeutic marker, an important step towards better clinical management that will help slow the progression of CAS in diabetic patients.",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence has shown an association between certain unhealthy lifestyle factors and cataract risk. However, the synergistic effect of unhealthy lifestyle factors on cataract risk and their underlying mechanisms remains unknown. This study analyzed data from 199,415 baseline cataract-free participants from the UK Biobank prospective cohort study. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models estimated the associations of individual unhealthy lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, and high body mass index) and their synergistic effect with cataract risk. Elastic net regression was performed to identify a metabolic signature reflecting unhealthy lifestyles, and the mediation effect was evaluated. Our results showed that only smoking and physical inactivity significantly increased cataract risk. Compared to the favorable lifestyle group, the cataract risk increased by 6% in the intermediate lifestyle group (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.09) and by 14% in the unfavorable lifestyle group (95% CI: 1.08-1.20). The Cox regression model also revealed that the metabolic signature of unhealthy lifestyles was associated with cataract risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.31; 95% CI: 1.18-1.45). Mediation analysis demonstrated that the metabolic signature mediated the association between unhealthy lifestyles and cataract risk, with a mediation proportion of 18.01% (95% CI: 8.57-34.70%). Metabolic pathway analysis revealed that two metabolic pathways (fatty acids and lipoprotein particle concentration and size) played a crucial mediating role. Our study underscores novel insights into the effect of unhealthy lifestyle factors on cataract risk and the mediating role of metabolic factors in this process.",

    "abstract": "Health care systems need better strategies to identify older adults at risk for costly care to select target populations for interventions to reduce health care burden. Cognitive impairment and frailty are among the two most common geriatric syndromes. We examined the association between cognitive frailty and health care utilization and costs. Participants aged 50 and over were drawn from four prospective cohorts of aging, including the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (KLoSA), the Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS), and the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). We classified participants according to their cognitive impairment and frailty status into the following groups: none, only cognitive impairment, only frailty and cognitive frailty. We used negative binomial regression models and sample selection models to explore the association between cognitive frailty and health care utilization and costs. Compared to participants without cognitive impairment and frailty, participants in the only frailty or cognitive frailty groups had higher average annual outpatient visits and inpatient admissions. Only cognitive impairment was significantly negatively associated with the probability of outpatient visits or out-of-pocket (OOP) costs. Only frailty was significantly associated with a higher probability of outpatient visits or more OOP costs. The association between cognitive frailty and outpatient visits varied by cohort. In KLoSA, cognitive frailty was associated with a lower probability of outpatient visits, whereas the other three cohorts show the opposite. Cognitive frailty was associated with higher outpatient costs in CHARLS, KLoSA and MHAS. Only frailty and cognitive frailty were associated with a higher likelihood of inpatient admission in each cohort, and they were also linked to higher inpatient costs in both KLoSA and SHARE. But cognitive frailty was associated with lower inpatient costs in MHAS. This study highlights the significant positive association between cognitive frailty and health care utilization and OOP costs in most countries. By recognizing the multifaceted nature of cognitive impairment and frailty, healthcare providers and policymakers can work towards more effective interventions and support systems that address the needs of middle-aged and older adults, ultimately improving their quality of life and reducing health care costs.",

    "abstract": "Pathological vascular remodeling and intimal hyperplasia after vascular injury are representative pathological processes in age-associated vascular diseases. Previous data from our laboratory have indicated that sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) contributes to physiological angiogenesis during embryonic development. However, the role of SCAP in neointima formation is not fully understood. Here, we aimed to explore the mechanisms of SCAP in the proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) during neointima formation after injury. We utilized three types of transgenic (Tg) mice to demonstrate that SCAP participates in the regulation of injury-induced neointima formation in the vascular wall by promoting the proliferation and migration of VSMCs. This novel function of SCAP is associated with the activation of the NF-κB/MMP2/9 signaling pathway. Importantly, we reported for the first time that SCAP activates the NF-κB pathway by promoting Trim27-mediated ubiquitination of the IκBα protein and accelerating its degradation, consequently activating MMP2/9 transcription, which resulted in migration and proliferation of VSMCs. We thus propose that SCAP/IκBα/NF-κB axis is a novel signaling pathway involved in the regulation of neointimal hyperplasia, and targeting this axis may have implications for preventing neointimal hyperplasia-related diseases.",

However, the specific contribution of T cells in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains poorly understood. Despite successful T cell modulation in other neurological conditions, similar strategies in AD remain underexplored due to gaps in our understanding of antigen-specific T cell activity and antigen-unspecific bystander activation in the diseased brain. In this study, we used flow cytometry to characterize T cell populations and their activation mode in an AD mouse model. By assessing GFP expression in C57BL/6J-Tg(Nr4a1-EGFP/cre)820Khog; Tg(APPswe,PSEN1dE9)85Dbo/Mmjax mice, we distinguished antigen-dependent from antigen-independent activation in CD4⁺, CD8+, and double-negative T cells (DNTs). This approach allows analysis of the full repertoire of antigen-specifically activated T cells in a physiological immune system without prior knowledge of target antigens. AD-like amyloid pathology progression was monitored by monthly scoring until mice reached 2, 6, 10-12 or 15-18 months of age and Aβ-quantification via thioflavine S staining. Antigen-specific activation during AD development was assessed by comparing AD mice with wild-type littermates. At 15-18 months, AD mice exhibited elevated numbers of activated, highly differentiated DNTs, along with increased antigen-specific CD8+ and DNT cells relative to controls. These results indicate a significant role for antigen-dependent immune activity in AD, highlighting CD8+ T cells and DNTs as potential therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD) are the two most common forms of dementia, and they share common mechanisms, especially in regard to neurovascular dysfunction. There has been increasing evidence that the disruption of the neurovascular unit (NVU), which consists of endothelial cells, pericytes, astrocytes, microglia, neurons, and basement membrane, is one of the key early events in both AD and VD. The objective of this review is to summarize the structure and physiological function of the NVU, then discuss the pathological remodeling of the NVU in AD and VD and finally, show emerging evidence of multi-target approaches that restore the NVU and neurovascular protection. We begin with a description of the structure, and dietary regulatory roles of the NVU in cerebral homeostasis, especially related to Aβ, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and neurovascular coupling (NVC). The NVU is then related to the pathological events that cause AD and VD, specifically to impaired Aβ clearance, inflammatory cascades, oxidative stress, and neurovascular uncoupling. Finally, the discussion focuses on a multi-target approach involving exercise, estrogen therapy, mesenchymal stem cells/exosomes, remote ischemic conditioning (RIC), and mindfulness meditation, and analyzes its implications for recovering NVU structure and function. We also discuss the concept of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) approaches associated with NVU modulation with herbal formulas, traditional Chinese exercises and acupuncture, which has integrative pathways for MVU modulation. NVU dysfunction has a significant and converging impact on the development of both AD and VD. There is considerable support for multi-pathway neurovascular unit targeting, which should show a significant delay in cognitive decline. Incorporating multi-modal evidence from contemporary and traditional medical systems could offer new insights for individualized, neurovascular-targeted therapy for dementia.",

    "abstract": "The choroid plexus (ChP), a highly vascularized brain structure responsible for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production, undergoes significant age-related changes that may contribute to neurodegenerative diseases involving disrupted immune regulation, fluid homeostasis and waste clearance. Compared to other brain regions, vascular research on the ChP remains limited despite its critical role as a central interface between the blood and CSF. This review focuses on age-related vascular and structural alterations in the ChP from both histopathological and neuroimaging perspectives, and explores their impact on CSF dynamics, immune regulation, and the integrity of the blood-CSF barrier (BCSFB). Rather than shrinking, the aging ChP often enlarges due to dystrophic changes, as shown in volumetric MRI studies. Histological studies reveal epithelial degeneration, basement membrane thickening, and stromal fibrosis in the normal aging process. In dementia such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), proteomic studies have identified upregulation of AD- and immune-related proteins, along with downregulation of proteins linked to CSF clearance and metabolic support. Emerging high-resolution contrast-enhanced MRI techniques now allow in vivo visualization of microvascular changes within the ChP, shedding light on its normal and abnormal aging processes. Understanding these alterations is critical, as they may influence the onset and progression of various neurological diseases such as AD, Parkinson's disease (PD), normal pressure hydrocephalus, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The recent advancements and challenges described in this study underscore the need for deeper investigation into ChP aging to inform future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies of neurodegenerative diseases.",

This study aimed to develop a nomogram-based SHS prediction model for anterior circulation stroke patients after endovascular therapy (EVT), addressing the current gap in early risk stratification of this population. This retrospective study enrolled 218 AIS patients who underwent EVT between January 2013 and June 2021, with an observed SHS incidence of 13.8% within the first two weeks post-EVT. We used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression and multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify variables strongly associated with SHS. The results showed that age (OR 1.060, 95% CI 1.021-1.100, P = 0.002), hyperlipidemia (OR 3.400, 95% CI 1.289-8.968, P = 0.013), creatinine (OR 1.023, 95% CI 1.000-1.046, P = 0.049), and total anterior circulation infarct (TACI, OR 4.875, 95% CI 1.984-11.980, P = 0.001) were significantly associated with SHS and were subsequently incorporated into the construction of a nomogram-based prediction model. The area under receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration curve, Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and Brier score were employed to comprehensively assess the accuracy and calibration of this model. The results demonstrate that the model exhibits good discriminatory ability (AUC = 0.812), calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow test P = 0.855, Brier score = 0.098), and robustness (internal cross-validation AUC = 0.811). Furthermore, we assessed neurological outcomes at 3 months post-stroke using the modified Rankin Scale and found that SHS was independently associated with an increased risk of unfavorable functional outcome (OR 3.267, 95% CI 1.159-9.212, P = 0.025). In conclusion, SHS significantly increases the risk of unfavorable outcomes in AIS patients undergoing EVT. The nomogram, incorporating age, hyperlipidemia, TACI, and creatinine, exhibits strong predictive accuracy for early SHS; nevertheless, multicenter prospective validation is warranted prior to clinical implementation.",

    "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent mental illness characterized by significant morbidity and mortality. Cognitive impairment is a common feature of MDD, closely related to the aging process. Epigenetic aging calculated using DNA methylation is an important marker of biological aging. This study aims to investigate the relationships among MDD, epigenetic aging, and cognitive function. We assessed age acceleration using epigenetic clocks based on DNA methylation data in discovery dataset with 39 MDD patients and 40 healthy controls, and then validated the results in one independent MDD cohort with 359 cases and 68 controls. The results revealed that patients with MDD exhibited significantly greater age acceleration as measured by the DamAge clock and elevated mortality risk as indicated by the Zhang clock. Notably, the age acceleration of DamAge was positively correlated with depressive symptom severity. Epigenome-wide association study of the age acceleration of DamAge identified 1,472 significant CpG sites. Enrichment analyses further revealed that these CpG sites are potentially involved in cytoskeletal mechanisms, signaling pathways, and inflammatory response. Cognitive assessments showed significant correlations between emotion recognition task performance and age acceleration from multiple epigenetic clocks, suggesting a link between accelerated epigenetic aging and cognitive impairment in MDD. Our results underscore the potential role of epigenetic aging in understanding the biological underpinnings of MDD and its associated cognitive dysfunctions.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic cognitive impairment (DCI) is a form of cognitive dysfunction that affects individuals with diabetes, marking it as one of the complications linked to this disease. This condition typically presents as deficits in various cognitive abilities, such as memory, learning, language, motor skills, perception, and attention. Studies show that around 13% of diabetic individuals aged 65 to 74 experience cognitive impairment, with this figure rising to 24% for those over 75. As the global incidence of DCI increases, the economic and caregiving challenges for both individuals and society are also growing. The specific mechanisms underlying DCI remain unclear, and the relationships among various pathological processes are still under investigation. The study of DCI mechanisms continues to present numerous unresolved mysteries, such as unclear causal relationships: does metabolic disorder (e.g., hyperglycemia) directly damage neurons, or does it indirectly affect cognition through vascular lesions? Additionally, the mechanisms of individual heterogeneity pose further questions: why do some diabetic patients experience cognitive decline (CD) while others do not? Therefore, understanding the pathological alterations and the fundamental reason behind DCI is essential for improving early prevention and treatment strategies for individuals exhibiting clinical symptoms of this disorder. Furthermore, DCI represents a significant intersection between metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases, which encourages the integration of cognitive assessments into routine diabetes management. This article not only provides a systematic review of existing research but also serves as a bridge connecting basic science with clinical practice, offering theoretical support for the precise prevention and early diagnosis of DCI in patients.",

    "abstract": "Stroke-heart syndrome (SHS) is associated with early mortality in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). However, reliable methods for timely risk stratification remain elusive. Combined monitoring of neurohormonal activation and electrocardiography may help identifying early mortality risk in SHS patients. This study investigates the interaction between elevated BNP and QTc prolongation on short-term mortality in SHS patients. This cohort study included patients with suspected AIS and concomitant SHS. SHS is defined as new-onset cardiac dysfunction after AIS, including acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, and arrhythmias. All patients underwent laboratory tests and electrocardiographic evaluations. Prolonged QTc was defined as &;gt430 milliseconds (ms) in males and &;gt450 ms in females. Patients were followed up for three months, and the study outcomes were all-cause mortality and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease (CCVD) mortality. Cox regression models were used to assess the relationship between BNP, QTc interval, and mortality, and the interaction between BNP and the QTc interval on mortality was analyzed. A total of 448 patients were enrolled in this analysis. Prolonged QTc was present in 217 patients (48.44%). Elevated BNP was associated with prolonged QTc (OR 1.90; 95% CI, 1.20-3.01, p=0.006). Elevated BNP, but not prolonged QTc, increased the risk of all-cause and CCVD mortality (HR 5.94; 95% CI, 1.22-29.03, p=0.028 and HR 5.48; 95% CI, 1.01-29.70, p=0.048, respectively). There was a significant interaction between elevated BNP and prolonged QTc on all-cause mortality (p for interaction &;lt0.001). Patients with prolonged QTc and higher BNP had highest risk of all-cause mortality (HR 4.92, 95% CI, 1.03-23.39, p=0.045). This study highlights a significant interaction between prolonged QTc and elevated BNP levels in predicting short-term all-cause mortality among AIS patients with SHS. Prolonged QTc emerges as a critical marker of increased mortality risk, particularly in patients with elevated BNP levels.",

    "abstract": "Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a complex inflammatory disease affecting individuals over 50 suggesting a strong link with aging-related immune and vascular changes. However, the precise mechanisms underlying this age-related susceptibility remain poorly understood. Considering the relevance of aging in GCA, genetic factors influencing biological aging markers, such as telomere shortening and epigenetic age acceleration (EAA), might also contribute to its development. This study investigated the shared genetic basis between GCA and these markers to enhance understanding of the role of aging in this vasculitis. Data from approximately 6.6 million variants obtained from previously published genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of GCA (3,498 cases and 15,550 controls), telomere length (472,174 individuals), and EAA (34,710 individuals) were meta-analysed using ASSET. Significant variants (p<5×10-8) were functionally annotated, and causal genes were prioritized using FUMA. Potential therapeutic candidates were identified through drug repurposing. This study identified 21 genetic variants shared between GCA and at least one aging marker. Two pleiotropic signals were annotated at PTPN22 and PLG, known risk factors for GCA, whereas the remainder represent potentially new susceptibility loci for this vasculitis. Several prioritized causal genes, such as SERPING1, SAR1B, SESN1, and SMC4, are involved in both inflammation and senescence, shedding light on the molecular pathways linking aging and GCA. Interestingly, expression levels of some of the prioritized genes PDE1B, ATXN2, and CNEP1R1, were dysregulated in immune cells from active patients. Drug repurposing analysis highlighted promising therapeutic candidates for GCA, including sulfasalazine, an anti-inflammatory agent, and investigational drugs targeting inflammatory pathways like NF-κB. These findings uncover significant genetic overlap between GCA and aging markers, offering insights into shared molecular pathways and potential new therapies targeting both inflammation and cellular senescence.",

    "abstract": "Aggregation of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) is a hallmark of several age-related neuromuscular diseases. However, our understanding of how these aggregates drive dysfunction is often limited by the use of non-disease-relevant models. Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is caused by a short alanine expansion mutation in the PABPN1 gene, which leads to nuclear aggregation of the protein. To investigate how these aggregates impair muscle cell function, we developed a muscle cell model with inducible expression of the pathogenic PABPN1 (A16) variant and confirmed its relevance to OPMD. Using subcellular fractionation combined with mass spectrometry and RNA sequencing, we examined the molecular consequences of nuclear PABPN1 aggregation. In the cytoplasmic fraction, we observed significant impairments in cellular metabolism and biomechanics. In the nuclear fraction, RNA metabolism was broadly disrupted, and additional RBPs were significantly enriched in insoluble aggregates. Importantly, mRNAs trapped within the aggregates were associated with impaired nuclear export and decreased translation efficiency, and the pathogenic PABPN1 variant led to reduced endogenous PABPN1 levels. Our findings support a model in which OPMD pathology arises from reduced levels of soluble PABPN1 due to nuclear aggregation and establish a mechanistic link between RBP aggregation and muscle cell dysfunction, highlighting shared pathological pathways across neuromuscular and neurodegenerative diseases.",

While previous studies have assessed brain heterogeneity by evaluating the dissimilarity of individual brain connectivity, further empirical evidence is needed to understand the factors behind brain heterogeneity in older adults. Using data from the 1000BRAINS study (N = 461, aged 55-85 years), we analyzed the individual variability (IV) of the functional (IVFC) and structural (IVSC) connectivity across 421 brain regions. We aimed to explore the relationship between network-wise and region-wise brain connectivity IV (i.e., both IVFC and IVSC), lifestyle, including psycho-social factors (e.g., self-reported smoking, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and social integration), and cognitive function via partial least squares correlation, stratifying analyses by age subgroups (55-64, 65-74, and ≥ 75 years), separately. Our results showed that higher connectivity IV was linked to lower social integration and/or higher smoking, and lower cognitive performance (e.g., episodic memory and executive control). For the network-wise analysis, we observed contributions from both IVFC and IVSC across eight networks, especially IVSC in the salience and ventral attention networks. Region-wise, significant contributions came primarily from the connectivity IV of specific brain regions (e.g., inferior frontal gyrus, right anterior cingulate cortex). This result pattern varied by age group. Connectivity IV was positively correlated with smoking in the age 65-74 group and negatively correlated with alcohol consumption in the age ≥ 75 years group. Overall, IVSC contributed more than IVFC with age. These findings suggest that unhealthy lifestyle and social isolation might be associated with differences in neural resources, which may be linked to increased individual brain heterogeneity and, in turn, to lower cognitive performance in older adults, supporting the revised Scaffolding Theory of Aging and Cognition (STAC-r).",

    "abstract": "The fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene is a key gene that has been linked to obesity and metabolic regulation. FTO single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly contribute to the pathophysiology of various multisystem diseases via epigenetic mechanisms. Although FTO has been extensively reviewed in the context of cancer, a comprehensive evaluation of its role in non-malignant diseases is currently lacking. This review aimed to systematically assess the molecular functions of FTO in the context of diseases other than cancer based on recent insights from the literature. Relevant studies were retrieved by systematically searching the PubMed database to explore the mechanisms through which FTO acts as a mediator of demethylation, its biological activities, and its functional roles in a spectrum of non-oncologic diseases. To explore pharmacological interactions, AutoDockTools 1.5.7 was used to simulate binding interactions between FTO and conventional therapeutic agents. Additionally, we conducted a bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer to visualize the frequency and co-occurrence of FTO-related terms, thereby helping to map research trends and knowledge gaps in the field. FTO regulates gene expression by modulating RNA methylation, particularly through the demethylation of N6-methyladenosine (m6A), thereby influencing RNA splicing, stability, and translation. This regulatory activity plays a major role in processes such as inflammation and fibrosis. Dysregulation of FTO has been implicated in several non-malignant diseases, including metabolic disorders, neurological diseases, and cardiovascular conditions. Computational docking studies showed that FTO exhibited strong binding affinity with two drugs and moderate affinity with eight others. Bibliometric analysis revealed high-frequency keywords and visualized research hotspots pertaining to FTO, providing valuable insight into current areas of scientific interest and potential future directions of study. FTO functions as a key epigenetic regulator in non-cancerous diseases and represents a promising biomarker and therapeutic target. Our findings underscore the importance of FTO-drug interactions and suggest that small-molecule FTO modulators may hold therapeutic value for managing a variety of non-oncologic conditions.",

Its prevalence varies across populations, largely shaped by demographic, socioeconomic, and lifestyle factors. Neuroimaging evidence further supports this construct, demonstrating gray matter atrophy in prefrontal and premotor regions alongside white matter hyperintensities, both of which have been linked to motor and cognitive deficits in individuals with MCR. The pathogenesis of MCR is likely multifactorial, involving metabolic, inflammatory, and genetic mechanisms that interact to accelerate vulnerability to neurodegeneration. Importantly, MCR has been shown to predict adverse outcomes, including dementia, falls, frailty, and increased mortality, underscoring its potential utility as an early clinical marker of neurodegenerative progression. Given these implications, recent studies have explored preventive and therapeutic strategies, such as aerobic exercise, dual-task cognitive training, dietary interventions, and pharmacological approaches targeting inflammation and metabolic dysfunction, that may mitigate MCR-related risks. Future research should aim to refine diagnostic criteria, integrate multimodal assessments, and develop personalized interventions to more effectively prevent or delay cognitive and motor decline in aging populations.",

While non-fragmentomics analyses have enabled diverse diagnostic applications, they often falter in diseases with subtle or widespread genomic changes due to low cfDNA abundance and clonal hematopoiesis interference. Emerging evidence reveals that cfDNA fragmentation is shaped by nucleosome occupancy, nuclease activity, and epigenetic factors, yielding distinct patterns in fragment size, end motifs, nucleosome footprints, and topology. These fragmentomics signatures diverge markedly between healthy and diseased states, and across age group, offering opportunities to complement non-fragmentomics and enhance accuracy.

The aim of this study was to examine the association between visual, hearing, and dual-sensory impairment and frailty prevalence. This cross-sectional study investigated 105,406 participants aged ≥39 years from the UK Biobank study. Visual acuity was measured with a chart, as the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (LogMAR); functional auditory capacity was measured with a digit triplet test, as the speech reception threshold in noise (SRTn). Dual sensory impairment was defined as the presence of both visual impairment (LogMAR &;gt 0.3 units) and hearing impairment (SRTn ≥ -5.5 dB SNR). To define the frailty syndrome, two methods were used, the frailty phenotype and the FRAIL scale. Analyses were conducted using logistic models adjusted for relevant confounders. Among the participants, 54.3% were women, with a mean age of 56.8 years (SD: 8.1, range 39 to 72). The prevalence of frailty was 3.5%, defined with the frailty phenotype, and 3.6%, using the FRAIL scale. For visual impairment, the OR (95% CI) of frailty was 1.51 (1.28-1.79) for the frailty phenotype, and 1.31 (1.10-1.57), for the FRAIL scale. For hearing impairment, in comparison with having normal hearing, the OR (95% CI) associated with insufficient and poor hearing were 1.32 (1.20-1.45) and 1.83 (1.53-2.19), respectively for the frailty phenotype, and 1.32 (1.19-1.46) and 1.93 (1.60-2.33) for the FRAIL scale. Estimates for the association between dual-sensory impairment and frailty were 2.22 (1.65-2.99) for the frailty phenotype, and 1.73 (1.23-2.42) for the FRAIL scale. Visual and hearing impairments were related to frailty. Having dual-sensory impairment was associated with twice the likelihood of frailty syndrome in comparison with having none of them.",

These associations are possible due to an abundance of human clinical research. However, age-related gait changes are not well defined in rodents, even though rodents are used as the primary pre-clinical model for many disease states as well as aging research. Our study investigated the usefulness of a novel automated system, the CatWalk™ XT, to measure age-related differences in gait. Furthermore, age-related functional declines have been associated with decreases in the reduced to oxidized glutathione ratio leading to a pro-oxidizing cellular shift. Therefore the secondary aim of this study was to determine whether chronic glutathione deficiency led to exacerbated age-associated impairments. Groups of male and female wild-type (gclm+/+) and knock-out (gclm-/-) mice aged 4, 10 and 17 months were tested on the CatWalk and gait measurements recorded. Similar age-related declines in all measures of gait were observed in both males and females, and chronic glutathione depletion was associated with some delays in age-related declines, which were further exacerbated. In conclusion, the CatWalk is a useful tool to assess gait changes with age, and further studies will be required to identify the potential compensating mechanisms underlying the effects observed with the chronic glutathione depletion.",

    "abstract": "The longitudinal association between glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and different courses of depressive symptoms is understudied. This study aimed to identify different trajectories of depressive symptoms and investigate the relation of HbA1c with the risk of increasing and high-stable depressive symptoms. In the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, depressive symptoms were measured using the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale in three visits (years: 2011, 2013 and 2015) among 9804 participants (mean age 60.0 ± 9.0 years). Group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify trajectories of depressive symptoms. HbA1c was measured at baseline and categorized five groups according to the respective quintile. Multinomial logistic regression was fitted to examine this relationship. Four distinct trajectories of depressive symptoms were identified: low symptoms (n=6401, 65.29%); decreasing symptoms (n=1362, 13.89%); increasing symptoms (n=1452, 14.81%); and high symptoms (n=1452, 14.81%). Adjusting for demographic, health-related, and cognitive factors, the risk ratio (95% confidence interval) pertaining to the highest HbA1c (Quintile 5) for decreasing, increasing, and high symptoms of depression versus low symptoms was 1.01 (0.82-1.25), 1.12 (0.92-1.36), and 1.39 (1.04-1.86) compared with the lowest HbA1c (Quintile 1), respectively. We observed a J-shaped relationship between HbA1c and high depressive symptoms, with the lowest risk at a HbA1c concentration of 5.0%. In summary, in this large population-based cohort, high levels of glycated hemoglobin concentrations were associated with a higher risk of increasing and high-stable symptoms of depression.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents one major health concern for our growing elderly population. It accounts for increasing impairment of cognitive capacity followed by loss of executive function in late stage. AD pathogenesis is multifaceted and difficult to pinpoint, and understanding AD etiology will be critical to effectively diagnose and treat the disease. An interesting hypothesis concerning AD development postulates a cause-effect relationship between accumulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations and neurodegenerative changes associated with this pathology. Here we propose a computerized method for an easy and fast mtDNA mutations-based characterization of AD. The method has been built taking into account the complexity of living being and fractal properties of many anatomic and physiologic structures, including mtDNA. Dealing with mtDNA mutations as gaps in the nucleotide sequence, fractal lacunarity appears a suitable tool to differentiate between aging and AD. Therefore, Chaos Game Representation method has been used to display DNA fractal properties after adapting the algorithm to visualize also heteroplasmic mutations. Parameter β from our fractal lacunarity method, based on hyperbola model function, has been measured to quantitatively characterize AD on the basis of mtDNA mutations. Results from this pilot study to develop the method show that fractal lacunarity parameter β of mtDNA is statistically different in AD patients when compared to age-matched controls. Fractal lacunarity analysis represents a useful tool to analyze mtDNA mutations. Lacunarity parameter β is able to characterize individual mutation profile of mitochondrial genome and appears a promising index to discriminate between AD and aging.",

The number of circulating EPCs, CD34+, and CD133+ cells and the percentage of CXCR4+ cells in each cell population at 1,4,7,14,21 days after TBI were counted by flow cytometer. SDF-1α levels in serum were detected by ELISA assay. The patients were divided into poor and good prognosis groups based on Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale and Activity of Daily Living Scale at 3 months after TBI. Correlation analysis between each detected index and prognosis of mild TBI was performed. Moderate TBI patients have higher levels of SDF-1α and CXCR4 expression than mild TBI patients (P < 0.05). The percentage of CXCR4+ EPCs at day 7 post-TBI was significantly higher in mild TBI patients with poor prognosis than the ones with good prognosis (P < 0.05). HAMA and HAMD scores in mild TBI patients were significantly lower than moderate TBI patients (P < 0.05) in early term. The percentage of CXCR4+ EPCs at day 7 after TBI was significantly correlated with the prognosis outcome at 3 months. The mobilization of circulating EPCs can be induced in mild TBI. The expression of CXCR4+ in EPCs at 7 days after TBI reflects the short-term prognosis of brain injury, and could be a potential biological marker for prognosis prediction of mild TBI.",

Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is another robust neuroprotectant that prevents brain swelling and improves the neurological outcomes of stroke patients. However, whether the combination of GBC and TH can be used as a reliable neuroprotectant in ischemic stroke remains largely unknown. We used the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model as well as oxygen and glucose deprivation-reoxygenation (OGD/R) endothelial cells as ischemic stroke models to investigate the efficacy and mechanisms of treating ischemic stroke with the combination of GBC and TH. The serum glucose, mortality rate, neurobehavioral functions, tight junctions, endothelial cells and inflammatory cytokines were evaluated in the stroke models after treatment with GBC, TH or the combination of them. After 5-hour occlusion and subsequent reperfusion, rats exhibited a large volume of hemispheric swelling and a high mortality rate. Stroke rats treated with the combined therapy did not exhibit hypoglycemia. The combination of GBC and TH exhibited synergistic neuroprotective effects in stroke rats that were associated with greater reductions in edema volume, better improvement in neurobehavioral functions, prevention of tight junction loss, and reduction of expression of the inflammatory cytokines COX-2 and iNOS. In OGD/R endothelia cells, the combination reduced endothelial cell death. This study demonstrated that both GBC and TH are neuroprotective after the severe stroke; however, combined therapy with GBC and TH enhanced the efficiency and efficacy of the effects of TH and GBC in the treatment of ischemia. This combined therapy may facilitate the clinical translation of TH management for severe stroke. The combination of GBC and TH seems to be a feasible and promising clinical strategy to alleviate cerebral injury following severe stroke.",

EM performance and hippocampal volume (HV) were characterized in patients with mild AD based on APOE-ε4 carrier status (APOE-ε4 carriers versus non-carriers) and FGF1 single nucleotide polymorphism (FGF1-rs34011-GG versus FGF1-rs34011-A-allele carriers).

Total of 43 PH patients who were diagnosed by right heart catheterization (RHC) and 20 age-matched healthy control subjects were included. Echocardiographic variables and blood biochemical parameters were tested. Results of World Health Organization functional class (WHOFC), Borg dyspnea score and 6-minute walk tests (6MWT) were recorded. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) were measured from RHC. Serum NLRC3 concentrations were detected by ELISA. ROC curve analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic value of NLRC3 concentrations in PH. We found that serum NLRC3 concentration was significantly decreased in PH compared to the healthy control group. Serum NLRC3 concentration correlated negatively with mPAP and PVR. In addition, a negative correlation between serum NLRC3 concentration and WHOFC were detected. We proposed a cut-off value of 2.897ng/mL for serum NLRC3 concentration which was able to predict PH with 88% sensitivity and 85% specificity. In conclusion, NLRC3 concentrations in PH were significantly decreased, suggesting that NLRC3 may potentially be a diagnosis index and represent a prognostic factor for PH patients.",

    "abstract": "Although autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, are frequently associated with premature aging of the thymus, a direct link is missing between autoimmunity and thymic atrophy. Here we monitored the progression of thymic involution in Aire-deficient mice, in which defective negative selection causes spontaneous and progressive development of autoimmunity. In young and middle-aged mice, Aire deficiency appeared to be protective as supported by the reduced β-gal+ epithelial cells and the enhanced thymic output. However, once the autoimmune phenotype was fully developed in aged Aire-deficient mice, their thymuses underwent accelerated involution. In comparison to the age-matched wildtype littermates, old Aire-deficient mice showed lower numbers of total thymocytes and recent thymic emigrants but more β-gal+ thymic epithelial cells. This phenomenon may partly be attributable to the increased number of activated Th1 cells homing to the thymus. This speculation was further supported by the enhanced thymic aging following repeated challenges with complete Freund's adjuvant immunization. Taken together, the present study highlights a unique mechanism by which autoimmunity facilitates the senescence of thymic epithelial cells through returning Th1 cells.",

Multiple linear regression-based analyses indicated severer non-motor symptoms were significantly associated with higher scores on the visual rating scales. Furthermore, we performed sample size calculations to evaluate the superiority of visual rating scales; the result show that using total scores of visual rating scales as an outcome measure, sample sizes for differentiating cognition injury require significantly fewer subjects (n = 177) compared with using total brain volume (n = 2524).

We investigated the relationship between degree of depression of TBI patients and the severity and progression of TBI with the therapeutic effects of Citalopram in combination with psychotherapeutic and Prednisone in depressed patients. There was no relationship between the severity of depression and the severity and progression of TBI. The basic treatment of psychotherapeutic interventions could partially relieve depressive symptoms. Combination of psychotherapeutic support and Citalopram significantly improved depressive symptoms in patients with normal cortisol levels, but not in hypocortisolic patients. Combination of Prednisone administration with psychotherapeutic treatment and Citalopram significantly improved depression outcome in hypocortisolic patients after TBI. Hypocortisolism after TBI may regulate depression.

    "abstract": "Aging-related adipose tissue dysfunction contributes to the progression of chronic metabolic diseases. We investigated the role of age-dependent expression of a neurotrophin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in adipose tissue. Pro-BDNF expression was elevated in epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) with advanced age, which was associated with the reduction in sympathetic innervation. Interestingly, BDNF expression was enriched in PDGFRα+ adipocyte progenitors isolated from eWAT, with age-dependent increase in expression. In vitro pro-BDNF treatment caused apoptosis in adipocytes differentiated from C3H10T1/2 cells, and siRNA knockdown of sortilin mitigated these effects. Tamoxifen-inducible PDGFRα+ cell-specific deletion of BDNF (BDNFPdgfra KO) reduced pro-BDNF expression in eWAT, prevented age-associated declines in sympathetic innervation and mitochondrial content in eWAT, and improved insulin sensitivity. Moreover, BDNFPdgfra KO mice showed reduced expression of aging-induced inflammation and senescence markers in eWAT. Collectively, these results identified the upregulation of pro-BDNF expression in adipocyte progenitors as a feature of visceral white adipose tissue aging and suggested that inhibition of BDNF expression in adipocyte progenitors is potentially beneficial to prevent aging-related adipose tissue dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a perpetual threat to life and functionality due to its high morbidity and mortality. In the past several decades, therapeutic hypothermia has garnered interest as an effective neuroprotective method in the setting of AIS. However, traditional hypothermic methods have been criticized for their low cooling efficiency and side effects. Intra-arterial cold saline infusion (IA-CSI), as a novel hypothermic method, not only minimizes these side effects, but is also perfectly integrated with widely accepted recanalization modalities in AIS, thereby serving as a promising prospect for clinical translation. In this article, we review the historical development of IA-CSI, summarize major studies of IA-CSI in rodents, large animals, and humans to date, and suggest insight into future development prospects in the field of AIS. We hope that this article will provide inspiration for the future application of hypothermia in AIS patients.",

    "abstract": "Manganese (Mn) is a potent neurotoxin known to cause long-lasting structural damage and progressive cognitive deficits in the brain. However, new therapeutic approaches are urgently needed since current treatments only target symptoms of Mn exposure. Recent studies have suggested a potential role for multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs) in the etiology of Mn-induced cognitive deficits. In this study, we evaluated the effect of direct intracerebral transplantation of NSCs on cognitive function of mice chronically exposed to MnCl2, and further explored the distribution of transplanted NSCs in brain tissues. NSCs were isolated and bilaterally injected into the hippocampal regions or lateral ventricles of Mn-exposed mice. The results showed that many transplanted cells migrated far away from the injection sites and survived in vivo in the Mn-exposed mouse brain, implying enhanced neurogenesis in the host brain. We found that NSCs transplanted into either the hippocampal regions or the lateral ventricles significantly improved spatial learning and memory function of the Mn-exposed mice in the Morris water maze. Immunofluorescence analyses indicated that some surviving NSCs differentiated into neurons or glial cells, which may have become functionally integrated into the impaired local circuits, providing a possible cellular basis for the improvement of cognitive function in NSC-transplanted mice. Taken together, our findings confirm the Mn-induced impairment of neurogenesis in the brain and underscore the potential of treating Mn exposure by NSC transplantation, providing a practical therapeutic strategy against this type of neurotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between fibrinogen and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are inconsistent. Whether there are different relationships between WMHs and fibrinogen in disparate subtypes of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) remains unknown. Here, we investigated the roles of plasma fibrinogen in sporadic CSVD (sCSVD) and Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) patients. We performed a cross-sectional study that included 74 CSVD patients (19 CADASIL and 55 sporadic) and 74 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs). Plasma fibrinogen was determined, and the severity of WMHs in CSVD patients was rated according to Fazekas scales. Univariate analysis and ordinal logistic regression were performed to evaluate the relationship between fibrinogen and the severity of WMHs in CSVD. Both CADASIL and sCSVD patients showed significantly higher plasma fibrinogen levels than HCs. No significant difference in the plasma fibrinogen level was observed between CADASIL and sCSVD. Univariate analysis and ordinal logistic regression indicated that fibrinogen is an independent risk factor for the severity of WMHs in CADASIL patients (odds ratio [OR] =1.064; 95% Confidence interval (CI, 1.004-1.127); p =0.037). However, age (odds ratio [OR] =1.093; 95% CI (1.033-1.156); P = 0.002), but not fibrinogen (odds ratio [OR] =1.004; 95% CI (0.997-1.011); P=0.262), is an independent risk factor for the severity of WMHs in sCSVD patients. Our results suggest that high levels of plasma fibrinogen are associated with the severity of WMHs in CADASIL but not in sCSVD patients, indicating that the role of fibrinogen may be different in disparate subtypes of CSVD. A better understanding of fibrinogen may yield insights into the pathogenesis of CSVD.",

Antibodies against beta-amyloid, neurotransmitters, microvascular endothelium components and microglial cells have been detected in AD serum suggesting that AD could be another autoimmune disease and provides a link between vascular pathology, endothelium dysfunction and neuronal cells death. Aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between autoantibody profile and cognitive impairment in geriatric patients, accounting for ApoE genotype as a potential confounding factor. Three hundred and forty-four geriatric patients, attending the clinic for the cognitive decline, underwent a biochemical and immunological profile, chest X-ray, cerebral computed tomography scan and complete cognitive evaluation. All patients were also screened for the ApoE genotype. A significantly higher prevalence of Anti-Smooth Muscle Antibody (ASMA) positivity was found in 89/204 (43.63%) patients with diagnosed neuroradiological signs of cerebral atrophy compared with 15/140 (10.71%) patients without the condition (p<0.001). Multivariable logistic model evidenced that such association was independent of patient's age, gender and Mini-Mental State Examination (OR=8.25, 95%CI: 4.26-15.99) and achieved a good discriminatory power (c-statistic=0.783). Results were also independent of ApoE genotype, which resulted not associated both with the presence of brain atrophy and with the presence of ASMA positivity. Our results shows a strong association between brain atrophy and ASMA positivity and are consistent with several studies that focused attention on the mechanisms of endothelial immune response in the development of dementia.",

Fifty-eight Alzheimer's disease patients underwent 3T magnetic resonance imaging. We applied a cortical unfolding approach to investigate individual subregions of the medial temporal lobe. Among patients homozygous for the APOE4 genotype or carrying both APOE4 and family history risks, lower education was associated with a thinner cortex in multiple medial temporal regions, including the hippocampus.

    "abstract": "The circadian rhythm is an internal timing system, which is generated by circadian clock genes. Because the circadian rhythm regulates numerous cellular, behavioral, and physiological processes, organisms have evolved with intrinsic biological rhythms to adapt the daily environmental changes. A variety of pathological events occur at specific times, while disturbed rhythms can lead to metabolic syndrome, vascular dysfunction, inflammatory disorders, and cancer. Therefore, the circadian clock is considered closely related to various diseases. Recently, accumulated data have shown that the penis is regulated by the circadian clock, while erectile function is impaired by an altered sleep-wake cycle. The circadian rhythm appears to be a novel therapeutic target for preventing and managing erectile dysfunction (ED), although research is still progressing. In this review, we briefly summarize the superficial interactions between the circadian clock and erectile function, while focusing on how disturbed rhythms contribute to risk factors of ED. These risk factors include NO/cGMP pathway, atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, lipid abnormalities, testosterone deficiency, as well as dysfunction of endothelial and smooth muscle cells. On the basis of recent findings, we discuss the potential role of the circadian clock for future therapeutic strategies on ED, although further relevant research needs to be performed.",

    "abstract": "Impaired wound healing is a major issue in the elderly population and is associated with substantial health and economic burden, which is exponentially increasing with the growing aging population. While the underlying pathobiology of disturbed skin healing by aging is linked to several genetic and epigenetic factors, little is known about the cell-cell interaction during the wound healing process in aged individuals, particularly the mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs)-macrophages axis. In this study, by using a thermal injury animal model in which we compared the wound healing process of adult and young mice, we found that the insufficient pool of MSCs in adult animals are deficient in migrating to the wound bed and instead are restricted to the wound edge. We identified a deficiency of a CD90-positive MSC subpopulation in the wounds of adult animals, which is positively correlated with the number of F4/80+ macrophages. <i>In vitro</i>, we found that CD90+ cells preferentially adhere to the myeloid cells forming doublet cells. Thus, our findings highlight that in adult mice subjected to a thermal injury, impaired wound healing is likely mediated by a disturbed cellular interplay between myeloid cells and mesenchymal cells.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is usually manifested in patients with dementia, accompanied by anxiety and other mental symptoms. Emerging evidence from humans indicates that people who suffer from anxiety in their early life are more likely to develop AD in later life. Mitochondria, the prominent organelles of energy production in the brain, have crucial physiological significance for the brain, requiring considerable energy to maintain its normal physiological activities. Net reactive oxygen species (ROS) was produced by mitochondrial impairment, in which oxidative stress is also included, and the production of ROS is mostly more than that of removal. In this paper, we propose that as a critical process in brain pathology, mitochondrial dysfunction caused by anxiety triggering oxidative stress might be a possible mechanism that links early life anxiety to AD in later life. Several pivotal physiological roles of mitochondria are reviewed, including functions regulating glucose homeostasis, which may disrupt in oxidative stress. Increased levels of oxidative stress are constantly shown in anxiety disorder patients, and antioxidant drugs have promise in treating anxiety. In the early stages of AD, mitochondrial dysfunction is concentrated around senile plaques, a landmark lesion composed of aggregated Aβ and Tau protein. In turn, the accumulated Aβ and Tau disrupts mitochondrial activity, and the tricky physiological processes of mitochondria might be significant to the course of AD. In the end, we conclude that mitochondria might present as one of the novel therapeutic targets to block oxidative stress in patients with anxiety disorders to prevent AD in the early stage.",

    "abstract": "The structures of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) currently designed for natural killer (NK) cells are mostly based on knowledge gained about CAR-T cells. Although these CAR-NK cells have shown promising effects, there are still many limitations to their application. In this study, we designed a soluble NK-CAR since the membrane protein NKG2D expressed by NK cells can directly trigger NK cell cytotoxicity by binding with the ligand MICA. This CAR is composed of three segments: the extracellular domain of MICA, an anti-CD20 single-chain variable fragment (anti-CD20 ScFv), and a human IgG Fc component. The nucleotide sequence of the soluble NK-CAR was cloned into a eukaryotic expression vector and expressed in suspension HEK293 cells, and the recombinant NK-CAR protein was then purified in a Staphylococcus aureus protein A column. The novel NK-CAR exhibited bifunctional activity, recognizing both the CD20 antigen of target cells and the NKG2D receptor of NKL cells. The NK-CAR activated the NKG2D receptor signaling pathway, causing NKL cells to express CD107a and secrete interferon-gamma. The soluble NK-CAR mediated the NKL cell killing of CD20+ Daudi cells in vitro, with a 1 µg/mL concentration inducing the maximum killing effect. Moreover, 51.7% (p < 0.01) of Daudi cells were killed at the effector-to-target ratio of 10:1. In the presence of recombinant rMICA and NKG2D-Ig proteins, this killing effect was reduced to 30% (P < 0.01) owing to competitive interference. Our results highlight the clinical application potential of this novel immunotherapy for killing target tumor cells.",

    "abstract": "Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) have been considered an attractive source of cytotherapy due to their promising effects on treating various diseases. Allogeneic MSCs (allo-MSCs) are extensively used in clinical trials due to their convenient preparation and credible performance. Traditionally, allo-MSCs are considered immunoprivileged with minimal immunogenicity and potent immunomodulatory capacity. However, growing evidence has suggested that allo-MSCs also induce immune response and cause rejection after transplantation, but the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that allografted MSCs upregulated MHC-II upon stimulation of IFN-γ in hepatic inflammatory environment by using mouse model of CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced liver injury. MHC-II upregulation enhanced the immunogenicity of allo-MSCs, leading to the activation of alloreactive T cells and rejection of allo-MSCs. However, MHC-II deficiency impaired the allogenic reactivity, thereby rescuing the loss of allo-MSCs. Mechanistically, CD4<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), rather than CD8<sup>+</sup> CTLs, acted as the major effector for allo-MSC rejection. Under liver injury condition, the transplanted allo-MSCs upregulated CD80 and PD-L1, and CD8<sup>+</sup> CTLs highly expressed CTLA-4 and PD-1, thereby inducing immune tolerance of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to allo-MSCs. On the contrary, CD4<sup>+</sup> CTLs minimally expressed CTLA-4 and PD-1; thus, they remain cytotoxic to allo-MSCs. Consequently, transplantation of MHC-II-deficient allo-MSCs substantially promoted their therapeutic effects in treating liver injury. This study revealed a novel mechanism of MSC allograft rejection mediated by CD4<sup>+</sup> CTLs in injured liver, which provided new strategies for improving clinical performance of allo-MSCs in benefiting hepatic injury repair.",

Our ability to measure secondary brain injury to predict the long-term outcomes of these patients is limited. We investigated whether the blood neurofilament light chain (NfL) can monitor brain injury and predict long-term outcomes in patients with ICH. We enrolled 300 patients with first-episode ICH within 24 h recruited in the Chinese Cerebral Hemorrhage Mechanisms and Intervention study cohort from January 2019 to June 2020. Patients were prospectively followed up for 12 months. Blood samples were collected from 153 healthy participants. Plasma NfL levels determined using a single-molecule array revealed a biphasic increase in plasma NfL in ICH patients compared to healthy controls, with the first peak at around 24 h and a second elevation from day 7 through day 14 post-ICH. Plasma NfL levels were positively correlated with hemorrhage volume, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale, and Glasgow Coma Scale scores of ICH patients. Higher NfL concentration within 72 h after ictus was independently associated with 6- and 12-month worsened functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale ≥ 3) and higher all-cause mortality. Magnetic resonance imaging and cognitive function evaluation were available for 26 patients at 6 months post-ICH, and NfL levels measured 7 days post-ictus correlated with decreased white matter fiber integrity and poor cognitive function at 6 months after stroke. These findings suggest that blood NfL is a sensitive marker for monitoring axonal injury post-ICH and can predict long-term functional ability and survival.",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that inflammation mediated by the pannexin1 channel contributes significantly to acute ischemic stroke. It is believed that the pannexin1 channel is key in initiating central system inflammation during the early stages of acute ischemic stroke. Moreover, the pannexin1 channel is involved in the inflammatory cascade to maintain the inflammation levels. Specifically, the interaction of pannexin1 channels with ATP-sensitive P2X7 purinoceptors or promotion of potassium efflux mediates the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, triggering the release of pro-inflammatory factors such as IL-1 and IL-18, exacerbating and sustaining inflammation of brain. Also, increased release of ATP induced by cerebrovascular injury activates pannexin1 in vascular endothelial cells. This signal directs peripheral leukocytes to migrate into ischemic brain tissue, leading to an expansion of the inflammatory zone. Intervention strategies targeting pannexin1 channels may greatly alleviate inflammation after acute ischemic stroke to improve this patient population's clinical outcomes. In this review, we sought to summarize relevant studies on inflammation mediated by the pannexin1 channel in acute ischemic stroke and discussed the possibility of using brain organoid-on-a-chip technology to screen miRNAs that exclusively target the pannexin1 channel to provide new therapeutic measures for targeted regulation of pannexin1 channel to reduce inflammation in acute ischemic stroke.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia that remains incurable and has become a major medical, social, and economic challenge worldwide. AD is characterized by pathological hallmarks of senile plaques (SP) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that damage the brain up to twenty years before a clinical diagnosis is made. Interestingly these pathological features have also been observed in retinal neurodegenerative diseases including age related macular degeneration (ARMD), glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy (DR). An association of AD with these diseases has been suggested in epidemiological studies and several common pathological events and risk factors have been identified between these diseases. The E4 allele of Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a well-established genetic risk factor for late onset AD. The ApoE ε4 allele is also associated with retinal neurodegenerative diseases however in contrast to AD, it is considered protective in AMD, likewise ApoE E2 allele, which is a protective factor for AD, has been implicated as a risk factor for AMD and glaucoma. This review summarizes the evidence on the effects of ApoE in retinal neurodegenerative diseases and discusses the overlapping molecular pathways in AD. The involvement of ApoE in regulating amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathology, inflammation, vascular integrity, glucose metabolism and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling is also discussed.",

Emerging findings have revealed the involvement of MDSCs in multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). MS is an autoimmune and degenerative disease of the central nervous system characterized by demyelination, axon loss, and inflammation. Studies have reported accumulation of MDSCs in inflamed tissues and lymphoid organs of MS patients and EAE mice, and these cells display dual functions in EAE. However, the contribution of MDSCs to MS/EAE pathogenesis remains unclear. This review aims to summarize our current understanding of MDSC subsets and their possible roles in MS/EAE pathogenesis. We also discuss the potential utility and associated obstacles in employing MDSCs as biomarkers and cell-based therapies for MS.",

    "abstract": "Ischemic stroke can be a serious complication of selective carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients with carotid artery stenosis (CAS). The underlying risk factors and mechanisms of these postoperative strokes are not completely understood. Our previous study showed that TMEM166-induced neuronal autophagy is involved in the development of secondary brain injury following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats. This current study aimed to investigate the role of TMEM166 in ischemic stroke following CEA. In the clinical part of this study, the quantitative analysis demonstrated circulating TMEM166, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were significantly elevated in patients who suffered an ischemic stroke after CEA compared to those who did not. Furthermore, non-survivors exhibited higher levels of these proteins than survivors. In the preclinical part of this study, a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was implemented following CAS simulation in TMEM166<sup>-/-</sup> mice. We found TMEM166 expression was positively correlated with the degree of ischemic brain injury. Ad5-TMEM166 transfection aggravated ischemic brain injury by inducing microglial autophagy activation and release of inflammatory cytokines. Accordingly, TMEM166 deficiency reduced brain inflammation and inhibited excessive microglial autophagy through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. These findings suggest that TMEM166 may play a key role in the development of ischemic injury after CEA and may serve as a biomarker for risk assessment of postoperative ischemic stroke.",

    "abstract": "Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) encompasses cognitive disorders associated with cerebrovascular disease, often manifesting as white matter lesions (WMLs), irrespective of precise triggers. The integrity of white matter is essential for neural communication and cognitive function maintenance. Persistent cerebral hypoperfusion-induced WMLs are now acknowledged as a key driver of VCI and dementia, though their exact formation mechanism remains unclear. Recent studies link pericyte dysfunction to diverse brain disorders like Alzheimer disease. However, the exact pathological connection between pericyte dysfunction and cognitive impairment in VCI remains unexplored. In this study, we aimed to examine whether pericyte dysfunction could impact WMLs and cognitive impairment in a rat VCI model. Using a rat model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion-induced VCI through two-vessel occlusion (2VO), we verified that 2VO induced both WMLs and cognitive impairment. Notably, the number of pericytes in the brain was significantly altered after 2VO. Furthermore, we observed significantly increased capillary constrictions at pericyte bodies in the brains of 2VO-induced rats compared to sham-operated rats, accompanied by reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF). To tackle this issue, we administered CGS21680, a specific adenosine A2A subtype receptor agonist, intranasally twice a day for 7 days. We found that rats treated with CGS21680 exhibited a significant increase in CBF at 7 and 14 days after 2VO, compared to the vehicle group. Moreover, capillary lumens beneath pericytes also increased after the CGS21680 treatment. Importantly, the treatment led to substantial improvements in WMLs and cognitive impairment compared to the vehicle group. Our findings suggest a critical role of pericyte dysfunction in WMLs and cognitive impairment within the rat VCI model. This insight contributes to our understanding of pathogenesis and offers prospects for targeted intervention in VCI.",

    "abstract": "Despite decades of research being conducted to understand what physiological deficits in the brain are an underlying basis of psychiatric diseases like schizophrenia, it has remained difficult to establish a direct causal relationship between neuronal dysfunction and specific behavioral phenotypes. Moreover, it remains unclear how metabolic processes, including amino acid metabolism, affect neuronal function and consequently modulate animal behaviors. PRODH, which catalyzes the first step of proline degradation, has been reported as a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia. It has consistently been shown that PRODH knockout mice exhibit schizophrenia-like behaviors. However, whether the loss of PRODH directly impacts neuronal function or whether such neuronal deficits are linked to schizophrenia-like behaviors has not yet been examined. Herein, we first ascertained that dysregulated proline metabolism in humans is associated with schizophrenia. We then found that PRODH was highly expressed in the oreins layer of the mouse dorsal hippocampus. By using AAV-mediated shRNA, we depleted PRODH expression in the mouse dorsal hippocampus and subsequently observed hyperactivity and impairments in the social behaviors, learning, and memory of these mice. Furthermore, the loss of PRODH led to altered neuronal morphology and function both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. Our study demonstrates that schizophrenia-like behaviors may arise from dysregulated proline metabolism due to the loss of PRODH and are associated with altered neuronal morphology and function in mice.",

    "abstract": "Intervertebral disc degeneration is a leading cause of disability in the elderly population. Rigid extracellular matrix is a critical pathological feature of disc degeneration, leading to aberrant nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) proliferation. However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we hypothesize that increased matrix stiffness induces proliferation and thus degenerative phenotypes of NPCs through YAP/TEAD1 signaling pathway. We established hydrogel substrates to mimic stiffness of degenerated human nucleus pulposus tissues. RNA-sequencing identified differentially expressed genes between primary rat NPCs cultured on rigid and soft hydrogels. Dual luciferase assay and gain- and loss-function experiments evaluated the correlation between YAP/TEAD1 and Cyclin B1. Furthermore, single-cell RNA-sequencing of human NPCs was performed to identify specific cell clusters with high YAP expression. Matrix stiffness increased in severely degenerated human nucleus pulposus tissues (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Rigid substrate enhanced rat NPCs proliferation mainly through Cyclin B1, which was directly targeted and positively regulated by YAP/TEAD1. Depletion of YAP or Cyclin B1 arrested G2/M phase progression of rat NPCs and reduced fibrotic phenotypes including MMP13 and CTGF (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Fibro NPCs with high YAP expression were identified in human tissues and responsible for fibrogenesis during degeneration. Furthermore, inhibition of YAP/TEAD interaction by verteporfin suppressed cell proliferation and alleviated degeneration in the disc needle puncture model (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Our results demonstrate that elevated matrix stiffness stimulates fibro NPCs proliferation through YAP/TEAD1-Cyclin B1 axis, indicating a therapeutic target for disc degeneration.",

    "abstract": "Zinc plays important roles in both physiological and pathological processes in the brain. Accumulation of free zinc in ischemic tissue is recognized to contribute to blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption following cerebral ischemia, but little is known either about the source of free zinc in microvessels or the mechanism by which free zinc mediates ischemia-induced BBB damage. We utilized cellular and animal models of ischemic stroke to determine the source of high levels of free zinc and the mechanism of free zinc-mediated BBB damage after ischemia. We report that cerebral ischemia elevated the level of extracellular fluid (ECF-Zn) of ischemic brain, leading to exacerbated BBB damage in a rat stroke model. Specifically suppressing zinc release from neurons, utilizing neuronal-specific zinc transporter 3 (ZnT3) knockout mice, markedly reduced ECF-Zn and BBB permeability after ischemia. Intriguingly, the activity of zinc-dependent metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) was modulated by ECF-Zn levels. Elevated ECF-Zn during ischemia directly bound to MMP-2 in extracellular fluid, increased its zinc content and augmented MMP-2 activity, leading to the degradation of tight junction protein in cerebral microvessels and BBB disruption. These findings suggest the role of neuronal ZnT3 in modulating ischemia-induced BBB disruption and reveal a novel mechanism of MMP-2 activation in BBB disruption after stroke, demonstrating ZnT3 as an effective target for stroke treatment.",

Postmenopausal endometriosis has more unknown aspects in its pathogenesis and clinical manifestation than in the case of premenopausal patients. The aim of this review was to summarize the clinical presentation of rare cases of endometriosis, including deep infiltrating (DIE) and extragenital endometriosis, in women. The symptoms of endometriosis in the post-reproductive age are more heterogeneous than in women of childbearing age, often resembling symptoms of gastrointestinal tumors or urinary tract diseases. We summarize cases of endometriosis of the intestines, liver, pancreas, and stomach, as well as endometriosis of the urinary tract and skin, with non-gynecological manifestations. We also describe the pathogenesis of endometrial tissue activity in the context of reduced estrogen levels after menopause, which is also not clear, and demands more molecular and genetic studies. NAD+-dependent deacetylases called Sirtuins are metabolic sensors for maintaining body homeostasis. In the context of endometriosis, Sirtuins are being studied for their potential role in modulating inflammation, cell proliferation, and sex hormone sensitivity, but their role in postmenopausal endometriosis is not well researched. Treatment in postmenopausal women includes mostly for now surgery, depending on the location of the lesion, and aromatase inhibitors. The complete genetic and epigenetic profile in women post-reproductive age is needed to propose target therapy, especially in severe cases such as endometriosis that is deeply infiltrating and located outside the pelvis.",

We analyzed the signal power of brain oscillations, brain state, sharp wave associate ripples (SPW-Rs), and functional connectivity between the cortex and HPC. We found that while both age and T2DM were correlated with a breakdown in long-range functional connectivity and reduced neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and subventricular zone, T2DM further slowed brain oscillations and reduced theta-gamma coupling. Age and T2DM also prolonged the duration of SPW-Rs and increased gamma power during SPW-R phase. Our results have identified potential electrophysiological substrates of hippocampal changes associated with T2DM and age. The perturbed brain oscillation features and diminished neurogenesis may underlie T2DM-accelerated cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation (DNAm)-based estimators of age are highly accurate for biological aging in multiple tissues, but their functional roles remain poorly understood in colorectal cancer (CRC), an age-related disease whose burden is higher in aged African Americans (AAs) than in whites. A greater rate of epigenetic age deviation from chronologic age was observed in AAs' colorectal tissues than in whites', emphasizing AA-specific investigation for epigenetic aging in CRC. Tumor tissue-based DNAm exclusively reflects cancerization, raising a question about its cancer predictability. A prediagnostic peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL)-based DNAm aging marker may thus provide keys to CRC etiology and prevention. From the largest study cohort, we examined 621 AA postmenopausal women 50-79 years old, including a subset of 14 who developed CRC, with their prediagnostic PBL-DNAm. Using three well-known pan-tissue- and blood-based epigenetic clocks, we evaluated correlations with CRC risk and to what degree the cancer risk is modified by lifestyle factors. Epigenetically older age and increased age acceleration were associated with reduced risk for CRC development. Of note, when women had accelerated aging phenotypes at screening, a substantial increased CRC risk was observed in short-term users of exogeneous estrogen, while a profound risk reduction was shown in women eating a healthy diet. Our study contributes to better understanding of the exertion of lifestyle factors in combination with methylome-based aging in colorectal carcinogenesis, detecting a prediagnostic PBL-based aging biomarker that promotes epigenetically targeted strategies tailored to aged AA women at high risk.",

    "abstract": "Histamine functions as a neurotransmitter regulating multiple neural processes, whereas interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine with recognized neuroprotective properties. Previous research suggests that histamine can stimulate the release of various inflammatory mediators, including IL-10. However, the precise molecular mechanisms governing the interaction between histamine and IL-10, particularly their role in safeguarding dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD), have not been fully elucidated. The current findings suggest that, within the context of PD, histamine levels are elevated in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) microglia, leading to an upregulation of IL-10 expression through activation of the H2 receptor and the downstream cAMP/PKA/p38β/CREB signaling cascade. However, the increased histamine concentration was negatively regulated by the IL-10 expression, allowing a limited increase in its concentration. Furthermore, the H2R-IL-10 pathway activation inhibited microglial activation and the production of inflammatory factors. Moreover, the H2R-IL-10 signaling axis modulated both membrane resistance and the expression of cleaved caspase-3 mRNA in dopaminergic neurons, contributing to the improvement of motor deficits in LPS-induced mouse models. These observations suggest that, in the pathological context of PD, microglia in the SNc exhibit increased production of histamine and IL-10 in a mutually regulatory manner. Elevated histamine levels further enhance IL-10 expression, which confers neuroprotection to dopaminergic neurons through its anti-inflammatory actions, ultimately alleviating motor impairments associated with PD.",

Chronic inflammation triggers immunosuppression and drives immunosenescence through interactions with inflammatory signals, the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), metabolic reprogramming, and microbiome. These processes remodel the tumor microenvironment via a multidimensional interaction network, which significantly weakens the anti-tumor immune response and accelerates tumor progression. This review proposes targeting strategies focusing on source intervention, SASP network blockade, and combination therapy optimization, as well as precise regulation with the help of novel technologies to break through the limitations of traditional immune checkpoint inhibition and provide new breakthroughs for overcoming tumor immune escape.",

    "abstract": "Anillin is a protein whose most recognizable function is coordinating the spatial distribution of cytoskeletal proteins during the course of cytokinesis. Its level increases in many types of cancer, and therefore, it has been proposed as a prognostic marker for some of them. Anillin is detected in the cell nucleus but so far, its nuclear role has not been recognized. Our recent studies have shown that anillin gene expression and protein level decrease in normal senescent cells, which could be attributed to inhibition of proliferation. However, its presence in the nucleus of neurons, postmitotic cells, suggests functions other than regulation of cytokinesis. Some data indicate that anillin expression may be regulated by p53, a protein usually induced in cells undergoing senescence due to various stimuli. The presence of p53 binding sites in the upstream promoter region of the anillin gene was mainly shown in in silico studies, and, so far, few experimental data seem to confirm such regulation. This study aimed to test whether anillin level decreases in senescent cancer cells and whether this is due to regulation by p53. Using p53-proficient and p53-deficient cancer cells, we have shown that anillin levels decreased in cells whose senescence was p53-dependent. We also showed that in cells escaping senescence, anillin reappeared with proliferation resumption, which correlated with decreased p53 levels. Our results demonstrate the universality of anillin reduction during the course of senescence and show that p53 is a negative regulator of this protein.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disease characterized by chronic high blood sugar levels and insulin resistance (IR). Modern medicine has shown that diabetes plays a role in speeding up the aging process of the body independently of age, making it an age-related aging disease. The oxidative stress caused by chronic high blood sugar and IR can lead to dysfunctional mitochondria, which in turn promotes changes in epigenetic regulation, shortening of telomeres, and cellular senescence. There is currently a lot of interest in understanding how T2DM contributes to senescence. This review synthesizes epidemiological and clinical research findings on aging across various organs, focusing on insulin resistance and oxidative stress as primary mechanisms. It introduces four diabetes-specific aging axes: glucose toxicity, toxicity of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), immunoinflammatory aging, and protein amyloidosis, which are integrated into the \"metabolism-inflammation-aging\" network. Additionally, we provide new insights into interventions targeting aging in diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Targeting brain inflammation has been proposed as a promising therapeutic strategy to cope with neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, accumulating data suggest that the gut microbiota partially exerts its neurodegenerative effects by exacerbating neuroinflammation through increased pathogenic or unhealthy genera that releases different types of cytokines in the periphery. Recently, soluble epoxide hydrolase enzyme (sEH) emerged as a new pharmacological approach for treating Alzheimer's Disease. Treatment with a sEH inhibitor (UB-BJ-02) modified the gut microbiota in the 5xFAD mouse model, increasing health-promoting genera such as Lactobacillus and Limosilactobacillus. By contrast, pro-inflammatory genera (e.g., Bacteroides) were decreased. UB-BJ-02 treatment enhanced the production of anti-inflammatory peripheral mediators in the colon and spleen, such as Il-10. 5xFAD mice treated with UB-BJ-02 showed improved short- and long-term memory and spatial memory compared to 5xFAD control. Furthermore, we found a reduction in neuroinflammatory markers evaluated by immunohistochemical assays, such as GFAP and IBA-1, and gene expression, such as Il-1β, Tnf-a, Il-6, and Trem2, in the brain of 5xFAD-treated mice and a significant decrease in the number of Aβ plaques. T Treatment decreased DRP1 protein levels while increasing OPA1 levels, resulting in improved mitochondrial function corroborated by the elevation of Pgc1-α. Interestingly, a correlation between UB-BJ-02 brain effects and microbiota changes were demonstrated. To validate this correlation, we fed CL4176 AD transgenic strain, with Limosilactobacillus reuteri and Bacteroides rodentium. Consequently, we observed that changes in feeding modified the number of Aβ plaques and neuroinflammatory markers in C. elegans. Therefore, the present study suggested that sEH inhibition with UB-BJ-02 promoted neuroprotective effects, modulating gut microbiota and modifying peripheral and brain pro-inflammatory markers.",

    "abstract": "Many countries are becoming aged or super-aged societies. This demographic shift causes substantial social, economic, and personal costs directly and indirectly attributable to cognitive decline. Recent studies have shown that dietary fiber can slow down memory decline, with short-chain fatty acids being the primary metabolites produced by gut microbiota from the fermentation of dietary fiber. Despite this, there are limited studies investigating the effect of SCFAs on age-related cognitive function and morphological changes of the brain. In this study, we used B6C3F1 male mice at the age of 3 months and treated them with water, low dose, and high dose SCFAs for 9 months. We assessed their short- and long-term cognitive functions using the Novel Object Recognition test, Morris Water Maze, and Rotarod test. Their brain structure was assessed by 7 Tetra Magnetic Resonance Imaging (7TMRI) and gut microbiota analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Our results show that both short-term and long-term SCFA treatment significantly improve cognitive deficits in the Novel Objective Recognition test and Morris Water Maze tests. Additionally, the 7T MRI results show that SCFAs mitigated hippocampal atrophy compared to the control group. These improvements were accompanied by alteration of gut microbiota composition. We also found that, after treatment, the beneficial gut microbiota Alloprevotella was positively correlated with hippocampal volume. Therefore, we propose that SCFAs may be a promising therapeutic strategy to counteract age-related cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition defined by the gradual impairment of cognitive functions, synaptic disarray, and extensive neuronal loss. Emerging evidence suggests that metabolic impairment, specifically within tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, is instrumental in the AD pathophysiology. TCA cycle represents an indispensable pathway in metabolism that is responsible for energy production, and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, particularly in neurons. Several in vitro, clinical, and in vivo studies reported that several TCA cycle enzymes disrupt during AD. Disruption in TCA cycle enzymes exhibits more pronounced impact on the brain owing to its high metabolic activity and continuous demand for energy, where any reduction in ATP production can severely impair neuronal function, synaptic plasticity, and overall cognitive processes. The current review explores the mechanisms underlying AD related impairment in TCA cycle, focussing on the molecular alterations of TCA enzymes. We also discussed potential activators and inhibitors of TCA cycle enzymes as a potential therapeutic intervention to restore AD related metabolic balance.",

The two most important risk factors for glaucoma are ocular hypertension (OHT) and advanced age. In this study, we explored the combined impact of aging and OHT on retinal neuronal and microvasculature health. We induced OHT using the bead-injection model in 12 week old (young) and 1.5 year old (old) mice and monitored intraocular pressure (IOP) for 2 weeks. We then explored vascular phenotypes, blood retinal barrier components, RGC counts, and electroretinogram (ERG) changes. Aged mice displayed reduced retinal microvasculature complexity, retinal vascular phenotypes in all three retinal capillary plexi (RCPs), and abnormal ERGs. Aging also impacted basement membrane (BM) and tight junction (TJ) morphology. The impact of OHT was much more evident in old mice; RGC loss was exacerbated, retinal vascular phenotypes were magnified across all three RCPs, and BM and TJ phenotypes were much more severe. However, the impact of OHT on retinal function was unchanged in old mice. Interestingly, the nature of these phenotypes was not equivalent among all RCPs, suggesting regional shared and distinct susceptibilities to aging and OHT. Taken together, aging causes multiple neurovascular phenotypes in mouse retinas, and OHT causes more severe effects in old mice. This suggests an interaction between aging and OHT that may help explain the increased prevalence of glaucoma in older humans.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is often associated with age-related chronic conditions; however, the role of biological aging as a potential risk factor for cancer remains unclear and largely unexplored. To clarify this link, we tested the influence of two biological aging measures in an Italian prospective population cohort, the Moli-sani study (N=24,325; age ≥35 years; 51.9% women). For each participant these were based on the difference between first and a second-generation blood-based biological age estimates (BloodAge and PhenoAge) and chronological age. The resulting biological aging acceleration measures (BloodAgeAcc and PhenoAgeAcc) were tested for association with cancer mortality, first hospitalization and incident fatal/non-fatal cases, using multivariable Cox proportional hazard models. We analyzed 22,985 apparently cancer-free participants with mortality data available (median follow-up 13.1 years) and found independent increases in mortality rates per one-year increase in PhenoAgeAcc and BloodAgeAcc. Additionally, statistically significant increased risk of cancer hospitalizations was observed for PhenoAgeAcc. The analysis of incident cancers for different body sites identified both increased and decreased risks associated with biological aging acceleration. BloodAgeAcc was indeed weakly associated with a reduced risk of both breast and prostate cancer, but with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer, while PhenoAgeAcc was associated with an increased risk of lung and renal cancer. Our findings suggest that biological aging acceleration may differently impact cancer-related risks, with protective effects for some cancers versus increased risks for others. Further independent cohort studies are needed to clarify the translational clinical impact of these findings.",

Falls typically result from multiple interacting risk factors, many of which are modifiable through targeted interventions. This mini-review focuses on evidence from randomized controlled trials evaluating effective therapeutic strategies to prevent frailty and falls. Comprehensive assessment and management of modifiable risk factors have been shown to significantly reduce fall incidence. Key interventions include community-based and home-based exercise programs emphasizing balance and strength training. Additionally, the treatment of osteoporosis is crucial to reducing the risk of fall-related fractures. Other modifiable risk factors, such as orthostatic hypotension, polypharmacy, environmental hazards, osteoporosis, malnutrition, and cognitive impairment, require targeted assessment and intervention. Despite these advances, further research is needed to optimize multifactorial interventions and tailor strategies to individual risk profiles. Innovative research directions now span from micro to macro levels, incorporating insights from animal models to human studies, aiming to unravel underlying mechanisms and develop personalized therapeutic strategies. This review discusses emerging evidence and new interdisciplinary research avenues that offer hope for mitigating frailty and preventing falls in community-dwelling older adults.",

    "abstract": "As the global population ages, there is an increasing prevalence of spinal cord injury (SCI) among elderly individuals, accompanied by significant challenges in treatment and recovery. Age-related conditions, such as osteoporosis, muscle atrophy, and impaired balance, predispose older adults to falls and traumatic injuries, leading to worse neurological outcomes compared to younger patients. SCI pathophysiology consists of two phases: the initial mechanical injury and the secondary injury that involves a cascade of pathological events, including ischemia, apoptosis, and neuronal cell death. Chronic neuroinflammation has emerged as a central factor in driving long-term damage after SCI, particularly in older people, where immune senescence and a decreased ability to resolve inflammation contribute to persistent, unresolved inflammation. This prolonged inflammatory state further impedes neural regeneration and functional recovery. Aged animal models have revealed that chronic neuroinflammation is exacerbated by sustained activation of microglia and astrocytes, the infiltration of peripheral immune cells, and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, creating a pro-inflammatory microenvironment that hinders repair. Furthermore, ageing-related factors such as immunosenescence, autophagy dysfunction, and mitochondrial abnormalities exacerbate inflammation, establishing a vicious injury cycle. Despite promising studies targeting inflammation in young SCI models, there is a critical need for age-specific therapeutic approaches for elderly SCI patients. This review explores the mechanisms of chronic inflammation in aged SCI, examines key cellular mediators, and discusses potential therapeutic strategies, including pharmacological treatments, gene therapy, exosome-based interventions, and rehabilitation. Focusing on age-related differences in inflammation and healing, this work aims to provide a foundation for precision medicine tailored to the ageing population with SCI, ultimately improving clinical outcomes and quality of life for elderly patients.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a neurodegenerative condition characterized by steadily increasing prevalence and incidence, arising significant challenge to both patients and social insurance. However, the etiology of AD remains controversial so far, and pathogenesis is far more complicated. Presently, no definitive therapeutic methodologies were available for AD, and only partial symptomatic relief can be achieved. Consequently, early diagnosis and intervention are emergently needed for AD patients. The diagnostic criteria for AD are continuously evolving, and biomarker testing is becoming increasingly critical for diagnosis. Currently, the diagnosis of AD primarily relies on the detection of pathological proteins through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing and positron emission tomography (PET). However, factors such as high costs, operational contraindications, and invasiveness limited the application of these technologies, making them particularly challenging to implement in large-scale clinical trials and screenings. Core fluid biomarkers for AD including β-amyloid (Aβ), phosphorylated tau protein (p-tau), total tau protein (t-tau), and their combinations were found in CSF. Although these biomarkers were demonstrated with significant specificity and sensitivity, challenges remain high concerning the collection of CSF. Blood-derived biomarkers for Aβ and tau proteins are essential for preliminary screening, diagnosis, and monitoring of AD. Additionally, other bodily fluids such as saliva, urine, and tears have been investigated for their potential as biomarkers, offering unique characteristics and applications. Emerging biomarkers, including neurofilament light chain (NfL), neurogranin (Ng), Beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), synaptosome associated protein 25 (SNAP-25), as well as inflammation-related and gene-related factors, provided valuable insights into the diagnosis and pathogenesis of AD from diverse perspectives. Despite the substantial progress made in AD biomarker research, there are still baskets of limitations concerning the complication of the disease. The current review focused on the reported literature to summarize the biomarkers associated with AD. By critically analyzing studies published over the past decade, we aimed to strengthen the recent research progress, theoretical frameworks, and unresolved challenges related to AD biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Biological aging is closely associated with heightened disease risk, frailty, and mortality. Interestingly, physical traumas, such as burn injuries, exhibit physiological effects that resemble those of aging. However, the impact of burn injuries on biological aging remains underexplored, creating a gap in the literature that could inform better prognosis and outcomes. We conducted a prospective cohort study to investigate the effects of burn injuries on various epigenetic clocks, including HorvathAge, GrimAge, PhenoAge, and DunedinPoAm, using whole blood. The study included 59 burn patients and 25 healthy controls and was validated using a murine model of thermal injury. Our study demonstrates that burn injuries accelerate biological aging and the rate of aging, with these effects persisting for up to 28 days post-injury. The extent of biological aging was positively correlated with burn size, with severe burns resulting in an acceleration of 13-14 years in biological age as measured by GrimAge and PhenoAge-double the acceleration observed with chronic long-term smoking. This acceleration occurred irrespective of age or sex, though older patients were the most vulnerable to the aging effects of burn injuries. The role of burns as an accelerator of aging was further confirmed in mice, which exhibited the equivalent of 3-6 human years of accelerated aging (8 mouse months, or 7 human days) after the injury, reinforcing the chronic nature of the effect. Additionally, burn injuries increased epigenetically inferred risks of frailty and mortality in humans, highlighting their long-term and enduring consequences. Collectively, our findings identify burn injuries as the most significant and chronic accelerant of biological aging reported to date. To our knowledge, this study is one of the first to link burn injuries-or any form of physical trauma-to accelerated cellular and biological aging.",

    "abstract": "Exercise has well-documented cardiovascular benefits, but excessive training has been associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF). The molecular mechanisms linking exercise intensity to atrial remodeling and AF susceptibility remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the effects of varying treadmill exercise intensities on atrial structure, metabolism, and electrophysiology in rats. AF inducibility was assessed using burst pacing, and atrial dimensions were evaluated by echocardiography. Histology was performed to quantify fibrosis and lipid accumulation. Metabolic and signaling pathways were examined through biochemical assays and Western blotting. We found that exercise intensity exhibited a nonlinear, J-shaped relationship with AF susceptibility. Moderate training (B-Mod) resulted in the lowest AF incidence and duration, whereas high-intensity training (B-Int) produced frequent and sustained episodes. Echocardiography revealed atrial enlargement in sedentary (B-Sed) and B-Int groups but preserved dimensions in B-Mod. Histological analysis showed marked fibrosis in B-Int but only minimal changes in B-Mod, along with progressive lipid deposition and impaired glucose handling at higher intensities. Importantly, PGC-1α expression paralleled AF susceptibility, peaking at moderate intensity, and was associated with decreased TGF-β and enhanced MAPK signaling. Pharmacological inhibition of PGC-1α with SR-18292 abolished these protective adaptations, increased fibrosis, disrupted glucose-lipid balance, and eliminated the correlation between Kv1.5 expression and AF resistance. In summary, moderate-intensity exercise protects against AF by optimizing atrial remodeling, metabolism, and electrophysiology through PGC-1α-dependent pathways. Both insufficient and excessive training impair these adaptations, increasing AF susceptibility. These findings identify PGC-1α as a central regulator of atrial health and a potential therapeutic target for AF prevention.",

    "abstract": "The gut harbors trillions of microbes that play essential roles in metabolism and immunological functions. The virome, an important but understudied component of the gut microbiota, comprises bacteriophages commonly referred to as bacterial viruses, among other inhabitants. Understanding the interplay between the gut virome and bacteria can illuminate the dynamics of microorganisms in both healthy and diseased states. This knowledge can open new avenues for treatment, such as phage therapy and microbiota modulation, which aim to restore balance in the gut and improve overall health. The composition and diversity of the gut microbiome and virome undergo significant changes, which have been linked to increased susceptibility to infections, chronic inflammation, and age-related disease. Exploring the gut virome's role in aging may provide insights into how viral and bacterial interactions influence immune senescence and gut resilience in the elderly population. This review provides an overview of the current understanding of the relationship between the gut virome, specifically phages associated with gut bacteria, and mechanisms of phage-host interactions, shedding light on how these factors affect and influence communities. Additionally, this review also explores the impact of the gut virome on gut resilience and its role in shaping and influencing the host's immune response. Maintaining a healthy gut requires a stable and robust virome. Therefore, future research on the virome is crucial for the development of microbe-based products that enhance human and animal health and aid in addressing specific diseases.",

The current study tested the hypothesis that in older adults without dementia, higher serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) are associated with reduced corpus callosum (CC) areas. French community-dwelling subjects (ESPRIT study) aged 65 and older (N=101) underwent hs-CRP testing and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Multiple linear regression models were carried out. In the unadjusted model, higher hs-CRP level was significantly associated with smaller anterior, mid, and total midsagittal CC areas, but not with the posterior CC area. These associations were independent of demographic characteristics and intracranial volume. After adjustment for body mass index, diabetes, inflammation-related chronic pathologies and white matter lesions (WML), only the associations between hs-CRP level and smaller anterior and total midsagittal CC areas were still significant, although weaker. These findings suggest that low-grade inflammation is associated with CC structural integrity alterations in older adults independently of physical or neuropsychiatric pathologies.",

The number of hCS above 60y of age were found to be more elevated in the euthyroid population (1.9 vs 1.6, p<0.01) than in the SCH population (2.3 vs 2.6, p=0.41) while increase in hCS is limited to SCH subjects in the <60y group (p<0.01). The percentage of subjects with at least 3 signs increased with SCH in the <60y group (42.6% vs 25.0%, p<0.01) but not ≥60y (34.4% vs 33.9%, p=0.96). In older individuals, only three hCS could be related to both SCH and a decreased T3/T4-ratio (0.26 vs 0.27, p<0.01), suggesting either a reduced activity of TSH, or an adaptive response with aging. While hCS are clearly associated with SCH in patients <60y, they are not so informative in older subjects. TSH measurements carried out on the basis of hCS need to be interpreted with caution in aged patients. A reassessment of the TSH reference range in older patients is clearly needed and should be associated to more appropriate monitoring of thyroid dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinases 9 (MMP9) is a member of the zinc-ion-dependent proteinases family and plays a pathogenic role in chronic inflammatory autoimmune diseases. However, its roles in the pathogenesis of myositis have not been elucidated. In this study, we aimed to determine the gene expression and serum level of MMP9 and their relationship with clinical features and serological parameters in myositis. Our results showed that MMP9 mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was upregulated in myositis patients compared to that in healthy controls. Myositis patients positive for anti-Jo1 antibodies exhibited significantly higher serum MMP9 than anti-MDA5 positive or antibody-negative patients and healthy controls. However, the presence of interstitial lung disease (ILD) did not affect MMP9 levels. We further identified that anti-Jo1-positive myositis patients showed higher numbers of white blood cells (WBC), lymphocytes and neutrophils; increased levels of creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein (CRP); and higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) than anti-MDA5 positive patients. In addition, serum MMP-9 levels were positively correlated with WBCs, neutrophils, CK, CRP, ESR, and LDH in myositis patients. In vitro experiments showed that purified serum IgG from Jo-1-positive patients could stimulate PBMCs to release more MMP9 than the IgG from MDA-5-positive sera. These results indicated that increased MMP9 in anti-Jo1-positive myositis patients was associated with the extent of muscle involvement, but not pulmonary damage. The distinct pattern of serum MMP9 perhaps clarifies the differences in pathophysiology between anti-Jo1 and anti-MDA5 in patients with myositis.",

Immunohistochemical procedure for m1 AChR detection was performed 2 months after pilocarpine-induced SE. In the CA1 pyramidal region m1 AChR staining was significantly decreased in aged epileptic animals when compared to young epileptic and aged control rats, indicating that the aging effect is worsened by the epileptic condition. However, the Nissl-stained cell analysis indicated that the number of pyramidal CA1 neurons was similarly reduced in both epileptic groups, young and aged animals. Therefore, our data suggest that the progressive reduction of m1 AChR expression in CA1 pyramidal cells of aged epileptic rats might bear relevance to the associated progressive cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial toxicity of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) is due to the inhibition of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymerase γ (pol γ). Previous studies have shown that wild type p53 (wtp53) can interact with pol γ and mtDNA to enhance mitochondrial DNA base excision repair (mtBER) activity and increase the accuracy of DNA synthesis. The N-terminal transactivation domain and central specific DNA-binding domain of p53 play critical roles in the stimulation of BER. In this study, we identified the possible roles of wtp53, Δ40p53 and Δ133p53 in regulating mtDNA pol γ activity in cells with d4T treatment. The results show that Δ40p53 and Δ133p53 can exist in mitochondrial fragments and form polymers with themselves or wtp53. Unlike wtP53, Δ133p53 alone cannot increase DNA pol γ activity. More importantly, we found that Δ133p53 played a negative role in p53 stimulation of DNA pol γ activity when studied in d4T-treated and d4T-untreated mitochondrial extracts. Gel shift data also indicate that Δ40p53 and Δ133p53 cannot interact with APE. Wtp53 and Δ40p53 can act antagonize the effect of d4T inhibition of DNA pol γ activity. However, when wtp53 interacted with Δ133p53, DNA pol γ activity was significantly decreased. Conclusion: Δ133p53 negatively regulates p53's stimulation of pol γ in the presence and absence of d4T.",

    "abstract": "Despite the use of antiretroviral drugs HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) are still common in HIV-seropositive patients. Identification of HIV patients with cognitive impairment in early-stage might benefit a great deal from disease progression monitoring and treatment adjustment. Intercellular adhesion molecule-5 (ICAM5), characteristically expressed on neuron, may suppress immune functions by inhibition of T cell activation in central nervous system. Previous studies have shown that ICAM5 could be detected in patients with brain injury. To investigate the relationship between cognitive impairment and ICAM5 in HIV patients, we compared soluble ICAM5 levels in paired CSF and plasma specimens from HIV-infected individuals with or without neurocognitive impairment. sICAM5 concentrations were measured by ICAM5 ELISA kit. A total of 41 Patients were classified into HIV infected with normal cognition (HIV-NC) and impaired cognition groups (HIV-CI) based on Memorial Sloan-Kettering Scale. CSF and plasma levels of sICAM5 in HIV-CI patients were significantly higher than HIV-NC group (<i>p</i><0.0001, <i>p</i>=0.0054 respectively). sICAM5 concentrations in plasma strongly correlated with sICAM5 in CSF (r=0.7250, <i>p</i><0.0001) and S100B in CSF (r=0.3812, <i>p</i><0.0139). Among 6 follow-up patients we found that sICAM5 levels in CSF and plasma might change consistently with HAND progression. In summary, we have shown that the expressions of sICAM5 in CSF and plasma may correlate with neurocognitive impairment in HIV infected patients. The elevation of sICAM5 in plasma were correspond with that in CSF as a consequence of blood-brain barrier permeability changes. ICAM5 can serve as a potential and readily accessible biomarker to predict HIV associated neurocognitive disorder.",

    "abstract": "As a new class of antidiabetic drug, incretin-based therapies, which include dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4Is) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), have raised concerns about symptoms of withdrawal in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), such as dizziness and headache. To systematically evaluate whether incretin-based therapies may lead to dizziness and headache in patients with T2DM compared to other traditional antidiabetic drugs or placebo. We searched Medline, Embase, the Cochrane library, and from inception through June 23, 2017, to identify randomized controlled trials of the safety of DPP-4Is or GLP-1 RAs versus placebo or other antidiabetic drugs in T2DM patients. We used the network meta-analysis under the frequentist framework to compare the association between multiple antidiabetic drugs and dizziness and headache. A total of 233 clinical trials with nine treatments and 147,710 patients were included: two incretin-based therapies, one placebo, and six traditional antidiabetic drugs (metformin, insulin, sulfonylurea, thiazolidinediones, alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2). Compared to insulin, thiazolidinediones, or placebo, GLP-1 RAs statistically significantly increased the risk of dizziness (odds ratios [ORs]: 1.92, 1.57, and 1.40, respectively) and headache (ORs: 1.34, 1.41, and 1.18, respectively). DPP-4Is increased the risk of headache (OR: 1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02 to 1.46; moderate quality) and dizziness (OR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.05 to 2.03; moderate quality) compared to insulin. Of the incretin-based therapies, DPP-4Is had a lower risk of dizziness than GLP-1 RAs (OR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.67 to 0.87; high quality). Ranking probability analysis indicated that GLP-1 RAs may have the greatest risk of both dizziness and headache among the nine treatments (22.5% and 23.4%, respectively), whereas DPP-4Is were in the middle (46.2% and 45.0%, respectively). Incretin-based therapies increase the risk of dizziness and headache compared to insulin, thiazolidinediones, and placebo.",

In this study we retrospectively reviewed the clinical and laboratory characteristics of 18 COVID-19 patients from January 30, 2020 to February 21, 2020. These patients were divided into two groups; group 1 had a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 nucleic acid-positive duration for more than 15 days (n = 6) and group 2 had a nucleic acid-positive duration for less than 15 days (n = 12). Group 1 patients had lower level of peripheral blood lymphocytes (0.40 vs. 0.78 ×109/L, p = 0.024) and serum potassium (3.36 vs. 3.79 mmol/L, p = 0.043) on admission but longer hospitalization days (23.17 vs. 15.75 days, p < 0.001) compared to Group 2 patients. Moreover, baseline level of lymphocytes (r = -0.62, p = 0.006) was negatively correlated with the nucleic acid-positive duration. Additionally, lymphocytes (420.83 vs. 1100.56 /μL), T cells (232.50 vs. 706.78 /μL), CD4+ T cells (114.67 vs. 410.44 /μL), and CD8+ T cells (94.83 vs. 257.44 /μL) in the peripheral blood analyzed by flow cytometry were significantly different between Group 1and Group 2. Furthermore, there was also a negative correlation between lymphocytes (r = -0.54, p = 0.038) or T cells (r = -0.55, p = 0.034) at diagnosis and the nucleic acid-positive duration, separately. In conclusion, the patients with nucleic acid-positive ≥ 15 days had significantly decreased lymphocytes, T cell and its subsets compared to those who remained positive for less than 15 days.",

By using high parametric single-cell mass cytometry, immune cell subsets and characterize their unique functions from ischemic brain and peripheral blood were identified after IPostC. This study enabled us to better understand the immune cell phenotypical and functional characteristics in ischemic brain and peripheral blood at the single-cell and protein levels. Since some cell surface markers can serve as functional markers, reflecting the degree of inflammation, the cell surface marker intensity among different groups was analyzed. The results showed that downregulation of 4E-BP1 and p38 of Microglia and MoDM in the ischemic brain was involved in IPostC-induced protection. In the peripheral blood, downregulation of P38 of CD4 T cell and Treg has also participated in IPostC-induced protection.",

    "abstract": "Patients with craniocervical artery dissection (CCAD) have a high short-term risk of ischemic stroke, which is frequently associated with thromboembolism. Previous studies have demonstrated the utility of three-dimensional vessel wall MR imaging (3D-VWMRI) in the diagnosis of dissection. Few have investigated the value of 3D-VWMRI in the detection of intraluminal thrombus. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the added value of 3D-VWMRI for thrombus identification in patients suspected of CCAD. One hundred and four patients (mean age, 44.2 years ± 13.2) suspected of CCAD and scheduled for digital subtraction angiography (DSA) were prospectively enrolled in the study and underwent VWMRI examination. The diagnostic performance of 3D-VWMRI for CCAD was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with the final diagnosis results as the reference. The presence/absence of intraluminal thrombus on 3D-VWMRI/DSA was independently determined. The sensitivity and specificity of 3D-VWMRI for intraluminal thrombus detection were assessed with DSA serving as the reference. The odds ratio (OR) was used to evaluate the correlation between thrombus presented on 3D-VWMRI/DSA and ischemic stroke. The 3D-VWMRI had high sensitivity (90.0%) and specificity (94.3%) in identifying arteries with CCAD. The area under the ROC curve was 0.96. With DSA as the reference, the sensitivity and accuracy of 3D-VWMRI for the detection of intraluminal thrombus were 97.4% and 79.0%, respectively. An intraluminal thrombus present on 3D-VWMRI was strongly associated with a territorial ischemic stroke (OR: 30.0; 95% confidence interval: 9.1-98.4; P < .001). In conclusion, 3D-VWMRI with a 3.0-T MR system had a high diagnostic performance for CCAD and offered added value for detecting intraluminal thrombus.",

The study was performed in male Wistar, a group of young rats with 2 months age and an old one with 18 months age. Old rats presented a significant higher urea, creatinine, interferon (INF)-gamma, ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor serum levels, as well as increased counts of reticulocytes and RDW. In addition, these rats showed significant lower erythropoietin (EPO) and iron serum levels. Concerning gene expression of iron regulatory proteins, old rats presented significantly higher mRNA levels of hepcidin (<i>Hamp</i>), transferrin (<i>TF</i>), transferrin receptor 2 (<i>TfR2</i>) and hemojuvelin (<i>HJV</i>); divalent metal transporter 1 (<i>DMT1</i>) mRNA levels were significantly higher in duodenal tissue; <i>EPO</i> gene expression was significantly higher in liver and lower in kidney, and the expression of the <i>EPOR</i> was significantly higher in both liver and kidney. Our results showed that aging is associated with impaired renal function, which could be in turn related with the inflammatory process and with a decline in EPO renal production. Moreover, we also propose that aging may be associated with INF-gamma-induced inflammation and with alterations upon iron regulatory proteins gene expression.",

    "abstract": "The kidney is capable of regeneration following injury. However, whether renal stem/progenitor cells contribute to the repair process after injury, as well as the origin of the cells that repair and replace damaged renal tubule cells remains debated. Therefore, better understanding of the repair process will be critical to developing new strategies for the treatment of acute renal failure. Using an ischemia-reperfusion injury mode and an immunocytochemistry method, we counted the number of BrdU-positive cells in damged regions at different durations of reperfusion. We found that BrdU, a cell proliferative marker, was mainly incorporated in the tubular cells of both medulla and cortex 1 day after reperfusion. The number of BrdU-positive cells reached a peak at 3 days and lasted for two months after injury. BrdU-positive cells were barely found in the renal glomerulus and the parietal layer of Bowman's capsule after injury, and only a few were found in the intersititium. PAX2, an embryonic renal marker, was also increased in renal tubule cells. Confocal images show that BrdU-positive cells co-expressed PAX2, but not the activated form of caspase-3, a cell death marker. Our data suggest that renal stem-like cells or dedifferentiation of surviving renal tubular cells in both the medulla and cortex may predominantly contribute to the repair process after renal ischemia-reperfusion injury in rat.",

Data about comorbidities, hematological data, iron status, dialysis adequacy, nutritional and inflammatory markers were collected from patient's records. Moreover, HRQOL score, by using the Kidney Disease Quality of Life-Short Form (KDQOL-SF), was assessed. Analyzing the results according to quartiles of age, significant differences were found for some parameters evaluated by the KDQOL-SF instrument, namely for work status, physical functioning and role-physical, which decreased with increasing age. We also found a higher proportion of diabetic patients, a decrease in creatinine, iron, albumin serum levels, transferrin saturation and nPCR, with increasing age. Moreover, significant negative correlations were found between age and mean cell hemoglobin concentration, iron, transferrin saturation, albumin, nPCR, work status, physical functioning and role-physical. In conclusion, our results showed that aging is associated with a decreased work status, physical functioning and role-physical, with a decreased dialysis adequacy, iron availability and nutritional status, and with an increased proportion of diabetic patients and of patients using central venous catheter, as the vascular access. The knowledge of these changes associated with aging, which have impact in the quality of life of the patients, could be useful in their management.",

However, whether the senescence of T cells is associated with severe COVID-19 outcome in elderly individuals is unclear. Using flow cytometry, we analyzed the frequency of senescent T cells (Tsens) in peripheral blood from 100 hospitalized elderly COVID-19 patients and compared differences between those with mild/moderate and severe/critical illness. We also assessed correlations between the percentage of Tsens and the quantity and quality of spike-specific antibodies by ELISA, neutralizing antibody test kit, and ELISPOT assay respectively, the cytokine production profile of COVID-19 reactive T cells, and plasma soluble factors by cytometric bead array (CBA). Our study found a significantly elevated level of CD4<sup>+</sup> Tsens in patients with severe/critical disease compared to those with mild/moderate illness. Patients with a higher level of CD4<sup>+</sup> Tsens (>19.78%) showed a decreased survival rate compared to those with a lower level (≤19.78%). This is more pronounced among patients with breakthrough infections. The percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup> Tsens was negatively correlated with spike-specific antibody titers, neutralization ability, and COVID-19 reactive IL-2<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. In addition, spike-specific antibody levels were positively correlated with IL-2 producing T cells and plasma IL-2 amount. Mechanistically, with defective CD40L, T cells from patients with CD4<sup>+</sup> Tsens>19.78% were unable to support B cell proliferation and differentiation. Our data demonstrate that the percentage of CD4<sup>+</sup> Tsens in peripheral blood may serve as a reliable biomarker for the prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients, especially in breakthrough infections. Therefore, restoring the immune response of CD4<sup>+</sup> Tsens may be key to preventing severe illness and improving vaccine efficacy in older adults.",

The mortality rate per 1,000 person-years with CBI was 59.0 (95%CI 57.0-61.1); with WMH=46.5 (45.7-47.2); with neither=17.4 (17.1-17.7). In adjusted models, mortality risk associated with CBI was modified by age, e.g. HR 1.34 [1.21-1.48] at age 56.1 years vs HR 1.22 [1.17-1.28] at age 72 years. Mortality associated with WMH was modified by both age and imaging modality e.g., WMH on MRI at age 56.1 HR = 1.26 [1.18-1.35]; WMH on MRI at age 72 HR 1.15 [1.09-1.21]; WMH on CT at age 56.1 HR 1.41 [1.33-1.50]; WMH on CT at age 72 HR 1.28 [1.24-1.32], vs. patients without CBI or without WMH, respectively. Increasing WMH severity associated with higher mortality, e.g. mild WMH on MRI had adjusted HR=1.13 [1.06-1.20] while severe WMH on CT had HR=1.45 [1.33-1.59]. Incidentally-detected CBI and WMH on population-based clinical neuroimaging can predict higher mortality rates. We need treatments and healthcare planning for individuals with CCD.",

    "abstract": "Aging in place is not without its challenges, with physical, psychological, social, and economic burdens on caregivers and seniors. To address these challenges and promote active aging, technological advancements offer a range of digital tools, applications, and devices, enabling community dwelling older adults to live independently and safely. Despite these opportunities, the acceptance of technology among the older adults remains low, often due to a mismatch between technology development and the actual needs and goals of seniors. The aim of this review is to identify recent technological solutions that monitor the health and well-being of aging adults, particularly within the context of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). A scoping review identified 52 studies that meet specific inclusion criteria. The outcomes were classified based on social connectedness, autonomy, mental health, physical health, and safety. Our review revealed that a predominant majority (82%) of the studies were observational in design and primarily focused on health-related IADLs (59%) and communication-related IADLs (31%). Additionally, the study highlighted the crucial role of involving older adults in study design processes, with only 8 out of the 52 studies incorporating this approach. Our review also established the interview method as the most favoured technology evaluation tool for older adults' studies. The metrics of 'usability' and 'acceptance' emerged as the most frequently employed measures for technology assessment. This study contributes to the existing literature by shedding light on the implications of technological solutions for community dwelling older adults, emphasizing the types of technologies employed and their evaluation results.",

Moreover, the omentum's capacity to enhance tissue perfusion, absorb edema fluid, boost acetylcholine synthesis, and foster neuron repair have rendered it a topic of interest in the context of various diseases, especially neurological disorders. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the intricate anatomy and histology of the greater omentum, casting light on its multifaceted functions and its associations with a spectrum of diseases. With a specific focus on neurological ailments, we delineate the intricate relationship that the omentum shares with other pathologies like stroke and we underly its contribution to serving as a therapeutic agent in neurological disorders. By deciphering the underlying mechanisms and emphasizing areas that demand further investigation. This review aims to spark renewed interest and pave the way for comprehensive studies exploring the greater omentum's potential in neurology and broader medicine overall. Given these diverse interactions that yet remain elusive, we must investigate and understand the nuanced relationship between the greater omentum and pathologies, especially its role in stroke's pathophysiology and therapeutic interventions so as to enhance patient care.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of two hallmark pathologies: the accumulation of Amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau proteins in the brain. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that astrocytes, a type of glial cell in the brain, play crucial roles in clearing Aβ and binding to tau proteins. However, due to the heterogeneity of astrocytes, the specific roles of different astrocyte subpopulations in response to Aβ and tau remain unclear. To enhance the understanding of astrocyte subpopulations in AD, we investigated astrocyte lineage cells based on single-nuclei transcriptomic data obtained from both human and mouse samples. We characterized the diversity of astrocytes and identified global and subpopulation-specific transcriptomic changes between control and AD samples. Our findings revealed the existence of a specific astrocyte subpopulation marked by low levels of <i>GFAP</i> and the presence of <i>AQP4</i> and <i>CD63</i> expression, which showed functional enrichment in Aβ clearance and tau protein binding, and diminished in AD. We verified this type of astrocytes in mouse models and in AD patient brain samples. Furthermore, our research also unveiled significant alterations of the ligand-receptor interactions between astrocytes and other cell types. These changes underscore the complex interplay between astrocytes and neighboring cells in the context of AD. Overall, our work gives insights into astrocyte heterogeneity in the context of AD and reveals a distinct astrocyte subpopulation that holds potential for therapeutic interventions in AD. Targeting specific astrocyte subpopulations may offer new avenues for the development of novel treatments for AD.",

RGC loss after OHT induction was significant at day 7 and progressed to 30 days. However, anatomical RGC death was preceded by significant Casp3 activation on day 3. Microglial inhibition by minocycline did not alter the course of OHT or rescue RGCs but resulted in a decrease in a-Casp3+ cells and phagocytic and total microglia. Therefore, RGC death commitment occurs earlier than their loss of Brn3a expression, microglial cells do not exacerbate RGC loss, and while this death is primarily apoptotic, apoptosis inhibition does not rescue RGCs, suggesting that alternative death pathways play a role in glaucomatous injury.",

Familial Alzheimer's disease (fAD) is caused primarily by mutations in the presenilin encoding genes, but the underlying mechanism remains obscure. Loss of the conserved <i>C. elegans </i>presenilin orthologue SEL-12 results in increased mitochondrial calcium, which promotes neurodegeneration. Here, we find that <i>sel-12 </i>mutant lysosomes, independent of SEL-12 proteolytic activity, are significantly enlarged and more alkaline due to increased ER-to-mitochondrial calcium signaling and concomitant mitochondrial oxidative stress. These defects and their dependence on mitochondrial calcium are recapitulated in human fAD fibroblasts, demonstrating a conserved role for mitochondrial calcium in presenilin-mediated lysosome dysfunction. <i>sel-12 </i>mutants also have increased contact surface area between the ER, mitochondria, and lysosomes, suggesting <i>sel-12</i> has an additional role in modulating organelle contact and communication.

Changes in the skin not only reflect conditions in the brain but also exert direct and indirect effects on the brain. Interestingly, the connection between the skin and brain is crucial for understanding aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Several studies have shown an association between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and various skin disorders, such as psoriasis, bullous pemphigoid, and skin cancer. Previous studies have shown a significantly increased risk of new-onset AD in patients with psoriasis. In contrast, skin cancer may reduce the risk of developing AD. Accumulating evidence suggests an interaction between skin disease and AD; however, AD-associated pathological changes mediated by the skin-brain axis are not yet clearly defined. While some studies have reported on the diagnostic implications of the skin-brain axis in AD, few have discussed its potential therapeutic applications. In this review, we address the pathological changes mediated by the skin-brain axis in AD. Furthermore, we summarize (1) the diagnostic implications elucidated through the role of the skin-brain axis in AD and (2) the therapeutic implications for AD based on the skin-brain axis. Our review suggests that a potential therapeutic approach targeting the skin-brain axis will enable significant advances in the treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "Vascular calcification (VC) is the ectopic deposition of calcium-containing apatite within vascular walls, exhibiting a high prevalence in older adults, and those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease. VC is a subclinical cardiovascular risk trait that increases mortality and functional deterioration. However, effective treatments for VC remain largely unavailable despite multiple attempts. Part of this therapeutic nihilism results from the failure to appreciate the diversity of VC as a pathological complex, with unforeseeable variations in morphology, risk associates, and anatomical and molecular pathogenesis, affecting clinical management strategies. VC should not be considered a homogeneous pathology because accumulating evidence refutes its conceptual and content uniformity. Here, we summarize the pathophysiological sources of VC heterogeneity from the intersecting pathways and networks of cellular, subcellular, and molecular crosstalk. Part of these pathological connections are synergistic or mutually antagonistic. We then introduce clinical implications related to the VC heterogeneity concept. Even within the same individual, a specific artery may exhibit the strongest tendency for calcification compared with other arteries. The prognostic value of VC may only be detectable with a detailed characterization of calcification morphology and features. VC heterogeneity is also evident, as VC risk factors vary between different arterial segments and layers. Therefore, diagnostic and screening strategies for VC may be improved based on VC heterogeneity, including the use of radiomics. Finally, pursuing a homogeneous treatment strategy is discouraged and we suggest a more rational approach by diversifying the treatment spectrum. This may greatly benefit subsequent efforts to identify effective VC therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Reduced adipogenesis is a prominent characteristic of aging adipose tissue and is closely tied to the development of metabolic disorders associated with aging. Epigenetic modification plays a crucial role in the aging process, yet the role of N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A), the most prevalent RNA modification, in regulating adipose tissue aging remains uncertain. Our study found that levels of m<sup>6</sup>A and its recognition protein, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (HNRNPC), decrease in adipose tissue as individuals age. Lower levels of HNRNPC were also linked to reduced adipogenesis during aging. Through loss and gain of function experiments with HNRNPC, we established a positive correlation between HNRNPC and adipogenesis in vitro. <i>Hnrnpc-APKO </i>mice displayed decreased adipogenesis, increased insulin resistance, elevated expression of aging-related and inflammation-related genes, decreased lipogenesis-related genes, and other metabolic disorders compared to their littermates. Additionally, we discovered that HNRNPC facilitated the stability of lymphocyte cytosolic protein 1 (<i>Lcp1)</i> mRNA by binding to the m<sup>6</sup>A motif of LCP1. Overexpression of LCP1 mitigated the inhibition of adipogenesis caused by decreased HNRNPC through modulation of cytoskeletal remodeling. Finally, our findings demonstrate that anti-aging treatments could enhance HNRNPC levels. In conclusion, HNRNPC is positively associated with reduced adipogenesis during aging, and increacing HNRNPC levels through anti-aging treatments highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for addressing metabolic imbalances in adipose tissue related to aging.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial dysfunction and blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage have been suggested as a fundamental role in the development of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) pathology. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that link cerebral hypoxic hypoperfusion and BBB disruption remain elusive. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) regulates the BBB integrity by binding to its receptor isoform 1 (S1PR<sub>1</sub>) on endothelial cells. This study tested the hypothesis that hypoxic hypoperfusion triggers capillary endothelial S1PR<sub>1</sub> disruption, which compromises BBB integrity and leads to SVD-related neuropathological changes, using a chronic hypoxic hypoperfusion model with BBB dysfunction. Spontaneously hypertensive rat stroke-prone underwent unilateral carotid artery occlusion (UCAO) followed by a Japanese permissive diet (JPD) for up to 9 weeks. Selective S1PR<sub>1</sub> agonist SEW2871 was used to activate S1PR<sub>1</sub>. Significant progressive reduction of S1PR<sub>1</sub> was detected in rat brains from 4 to 9 weeks following UCAO/JPD onset, which was also detected in cerebral vasculature in human SVD. S1PR<sub>1</sub> activation by SEW2871 significantly reduced lesions in both white and grey matter and ameliorated cerebral blood flow. SEW2871 reversed the loss of endothelial S1PR<sub>1</sub> and tight junction proteins, and significantly attenuated UCAO/JPD induced accumulation of neuronal phosphorylated tau. This protective role of SEW2871 is associated with promotion of Akt phosphorylation and inhibition of S1PR<sub>2</sub>/Erk1/2 activation. Our data suggest S1PR<sub>1</sub> signalling as a potential molecular mechanistic basis that links hypoxic hypoperfusion with BBB damage in the neuropathological cascades in SVD. The reversal of BBB disruption through pharmacological intervention of S1PR<sub>1</sub> signalling likely reveals a novel therapeutic target for SVD.",

    "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that affects the living quality of patients, especially the elderly population. RA-related morbidity and mortality increase significantly with age, while current clinical drugs for RA are far from satisfactory and may have serious side effects. Therefore, the development of new drugs with higher biosafety and efficacy is demanding. Black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNSs) have been widely studied because of their excellent biocompatibility. Here, we focus on the inherent bioactivity of BPNSs, report the potential of BPNSs as a therapeutic drug for RA and elucidate the underlying therapeutic mechanism. We find that BPNSs inhibit autophagy at an early stage via the AMPK-mTOR pathway, switch the energy metabolic pathway to oxidative phosphorylation, increase intracellular ATP levels, suppress apoptosis, reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, and down-regulate senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)-related genes in rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RA-SFs). Further, BPNSs induce the apoptosis of macrophages and promote their transition from the M1 to the M2 phenotype by regulating related cytokines. Significantly, the administration of BPNSs can alleviate key pathological features of RA in mice, revealing great therapeutic potential. This study provides a novel option for treating RA, with BPNSs emerging as a promising therapeutic candidate.",

Common vascular aging hallmarks include endothelial dysfunction, telomere dysfunction, and vascular inflammation. In this study, we sought to test the hypothesis that young-derived gut microbiota retards vascular aging hallmarks and metabolic impairments in aged hosts. We also aimed to study the therapeutic efficacy of young microbiota in hosts of different ages. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from young to aged or middle-aged C57BL/6 mice was conducted for 6 consecutive weeks after antibiotic pretreatment. Endothelium-dependent relaxations (EDRs) in mouse arteries were determined by wire myography. Inflammation and AMPK/SIRT1 signaling in mouse aortas and intestines were studied by biochemical assays. The telomere function of aortas and intestines, in terms of telomerase reverse transcriptase expression, telomerase activity, and relative telomere length, were also studied. FMT significantly reverted vascular dysfunction and metabolic impairments in middle-aged mice than in aged mice. Besides, FMT significantly reverted inflammation and telomere dysfunction in aortas and intestines of middle-aged mice. Improved intestinal barrier function and activated AMPK/SIRT1 signaling potentially underlie benefits of FMT. The findings imply gut-vascular connection as potential target against age-associated cardiometabolic disorders, highlight crosstalk among aging hallmarks, and suggest a critical timepoint for efficacy of anti-aging interventions.",

    "abstract": "The breakdown of immune tolerance and the rise in autoimmunity contribute to the onset of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), driven by significant changes in immune components. Recent advances in single-cell and spatial transcriptome profiling have revealed shifts in cell distribution and composition, expanding our understanding beyond molecular-level changes in inflammatory cytokines, autoantibodies, and autoantigens in RA. Surprisingly, synovial fibroblasts (SFs) play an active immunopathogenic role rather than remaining passive bystanders in RA, with notable alterations in their subpopulation distribution and composition. This study examines these changes in SF heterogeneity, assesses their impact on RA progression, and elucidates the immune characteristics and functions of SF subsets in the RA autoimmunity, encompassing both intrinsic and adaptive immunity. Additionally, this review discusses therapeutic strategies targeting immune SF subsets, highlighting the potential of future interventions in SF phenotypic reprogramming. Overall, this review redefines the role of SFs in RA and suggests targeting SF phenotypic reprogramming and its upstream molecules as a promising therapeutic approach to restore immune balance and modulate immune tolerance in RA.",

However, ICI therapy can lead to notable negative outcomes known as immune-related adverse events (irAEs). ICI-induced arthritis, also known as ICI arthritis, stands as the prevailing form of irAEs. The purpose of this review is to highlight the crucial functions of T cells in the progression of ICI arthritis. Under the influence of different signaling molecules, T cells could gather in large numbers within the synovial membrane of joints, releasing inflammatory substances and enzymes that harm healthy tissues, ultimately causing ICI arthritis. Moreover, considering the functions of T cells in triggering ICI arthritis, this review suggests several treatments to prevent ICI arthritis, including inhibiting the overstimulation of T cells at the synovial sac of joints, enhancing the precision of ICI medications, and directing ICI drugs specifically towards tumor tissues instead of joints. Collectively, T lymphocytes play a vital role in the onset of ICI arthritis, offering a hopeful perspective on treating ICI arthritis through the specific targeting of T cells within the affected joints.",

    "abstract": "Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease affecting millions worldwide, characterised by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration which leads to blindness in more advanced cases. Although the pathogenesis and underlying mechanisms of glaucoma are not fully understood, there are theories that hint at demyelination playing a role in the disease process. Demyelination, or the degeneration of the myelin sheath surrounding axons, has been found in previous studies using animal models of glaucoma and clinical assessments of glaucoma patients. However, this has not been fully realised or quantified in glaucoma patients. Utilising postmortem optic nerve samples from glaucoma and healthy subjects, various immunohistochemical and morphological assessments were performed to determine the extent, if any, of demyelination in glaucomatous optic nerves. Our findings revealed that alongside nerve shrinkage and degeneration of nerve tissue fascicles, there were significantly less myelin proteins, specifically myelin basic protein (MBP), in glaucoma optic nerves. Additionally, the loss of MBP was correlated with decreased oligodendrocyte (OLG) precursors and increasing glial activity. This further supports previous evidence that demyelination may be a secondary degenerative process associated with glaucoma disease progression. Not only do these results provide evidence for potential disease mechanisms, but this is also the first study to quantify optic nerve demyelination in glaucoma postmortem tissue.",

Two hallmark features of AD are the anomalous cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), which leads to the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ), and the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein. Despite extensive research efforts, the pathology and pathogenesis of AD remain elusive. Recent investigations have highlighted the close association between antisense long non-coding RNAs (AS-lncRNAs) and various biological and functional aspects of AD. However, many AS-lncRNAs implicated in AD have not yet been comprehensively compiled and discussed.

Cisd2, a master gene for Marfan syndrome, plays an essential role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and functions. As shown by our data, specific deletion of Cisd2 in the cochlea exacerbated the hearing impairment of ARHL in C57BL/6 mice. Increased defects in mitochondrial function, potassium homeostasis and synapse activity were observed in the Cisd2-deleted mouse models. These mechanistic phenotypes combined with oxidative stress contribute to cell death in the whole cochlea. Human patients with obviously deteriorated ARHL had low Cisd2 expression; therefore, Cisd2 may be a potential target for designing therapeutic methods to attenuate the disease progression of ARHL.",

Senescent cells release a plethora of inflammatory and growth factors, extracellular matrix proteins, and other bioactive substances, collectively known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). These excreted substances serve as crucial mediators of senescent tissues, while the secretion of SASP by senescent neurons and glial cells in the central nervous system modulates the activity of immune cells. Senescent immune cells also influence the physiological activities of various cells in the central nervous system. Further, the interaction between cellular senescence and immune regulation collectively affects the physiological and pathological processes of the central nervous system. Herein, we explore the role of senescence in the physiological and pathological processes underlying embryonic development, aging, degeneration, and injury of the central nervous system, through the immune response. Further, we elucidate the role of senescence in the physiological and pathological processes of the central nervous system, proposing a new theoretical foundation for treating central nervous system diseases.",

    "abstract": "Reperfusion strategies such as vascular thrombolysis and thrombectomy are the first-line treatments recommended for acute ischemic stroke. However, only half of these patients achieve functional independence after endovascular reperfusion of large vessel occlusions. Timely restoration of blood flow is crucial, but not all reperfusion results in benefit, a phenomenon termed futile reperfusion. Futile reperfusion occurs when brain tissue has already suffered irreversible damage before reperfusion or when other factors undermine the benefits of restored blood flow. These factors include reperfusion-not rescued injury, reperfusion-induced injury, and the no-reflow phenomenon. The success of reperfusion therapies also hinges on timing and tissue condition after stroke. Defining these time and tissue windows more precisely could refine stroke interventions, potentially expanding effective reperfusion opportunities tailored to individual patients, thereby reducing the incidence of futile reperfusion. This perspective article delves into the complexities of futile reperfusion and the critical roles of time and tissue windows in determining stroke outcomes.",

Although both conditions share common pathogenic pathways, they exhibit distinct cellular manifestations and disease progression. This study focused on the differential expression and role of astrocytic colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) in these diseases. Through transcriptomic analysis of 248 brain tissue samples from the hippocampal-entorhinal system of 50 individuals, we identified a significant increase in CSF1 expression in the CA4 subfield of AD patients, contrasting with a marked decrease in CAA. Functional investigations revealed that astrocytes with elevated CSF1 levels displayed neurotoxicity associated with AD-like pathology, while reduced CSF1 expression in astrocytes was linked to vascular damage characteristic of CAA. These findings suggest that CSF1 plays divergent roles in AD and CAA, contributing to their distinct pathological profiles. Our study highlights the potential of targeting astrocytic CSF1 expression as both a differential diagnostic marker and a therapeutic approach in managing these overlapping yet distinct neurological conditions.",

These elements contribute to its diverse phenotypes and endotypes, underscoring the disease's inherent complexity.

The current limitations in spatial phenotyping technologies, coupled with the intricate web of multifactorial interactions, have hindered the discovery of reliable early diagnostic markers and the development of tailored therapeutic strategies.

Mitochondria regulates their dynamic networks through a mitochondria quality control (MQC) mechanism, involving mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial dynamics, and mitophagy. The MQC is crucial for mitochondrial homeostasis and health, and disruption of it can lead to mitochondrial damage, which is a key factor in the structural and functional impairment of skeletal muscle in COPD. The mitochondria in the skeletal muscles of these patients undergo changes, mainly including decrease in mitochondrial density and biogenesis levels, imbalanced mitochondrial fission and fusion, and altered mitophagy status. However, the potential mechanisms linking MQC to the damaged structure and function of skeletal muscles in COPD have not been fully clarified. Therefore, this review highlights the effects and potential pathways of the MQC system on the dysfunction of skeletal muscle (muscle atrophy, impaired myogenesis and regeneration, and aerobic endurance) in patients with COPD, and summarizes potential interventions targeted MQC, intending to provide a theoretical basis for further research on COPD, improve SMD, and enhance the quality of life.",

However, reports regarding the levels of autophagy in microglia have been inconsistent; some studies indicate an early enhancement followed by a subsequent reduction, while others describe a persistently weakened state. Notably, there is a lack of systematic studies documenting the temporal changes in microglial autophagy. TBC1D15, a Rab GTPase, plays a crucial role in lysosomal membrane repair, yet its function in regulating microglial autophagy in Alzheimer's disease remains unexplored. Current research suggests that microglial autophagy is activated in 3-month-old AD mice but gradually decreases by 12 months of age. Furthermore, TBC1D15 levels are significantly elevated in the lysosomes of microglia in Alzheimer's disease. Silencing TBC1D15 markedly inhibits swelling and Aβ phagocytosis in BV2 cells following Aβ treatment while simultaneously promoting autophagy and lysophagy. LIMP II/ATG8-TBC1D15-Dynamin2/RAB7 might participate in lysosome swelling of microglia in AD. These findings indicate that TBC1D15 in microglia is critical for the decline of autophagy in Alzheimer's disease. It is suggested that targeting microglial TBC1D15 may be an important strategy for enhancing autophagy, which facilitates the clearance of amyloid plaques as a therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation and density of lipid droplets (LDs) in cells have been identified as a potential biomarker to detect senescent cells. However, their intracellular dynamic transport and alterations during senescence remain largely unclear. To address this knowledge gap, senescence was induced in human microglia cells using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to investigate both short-term and long-term effects of H2O2 treatment on LD dynamics. We captured time-lapse holotomograms of LDs using label-free refractive index (RI)-based holotomography and quantified 11 dynamic parameters of LDs through single-particle tracking. These quantified parameters were then compared across healthy cells, short-term H2O2-treated pre-senescent cells (H2O2-treated cells), and long-term H2O2-induced senescent cells (senescent cells). The results revealed that LD dynamics are significantly altered in both H2O2-treated pre-senescent cells and H2O2-induced senescent cells, though with differing trends. Healthy cells exhibited higher values in all LD dynamic parameters compared to senescent cells, with the exception of the mean directional change rate, which is lower. In addition, H2O2-treated cells showed higher values in dynamic parameters such as total displacement, mean straight-line velocity, and confinement ratio compared to healthy and senescent cells, due to the observed linear migration of LDs during H2O2 treatment. We found that the altered movement of LDs is closely related to H2O2-induced damage to microtubule networks. These findings suggest that altered LD dynamics, along with associated molecules and pathways, may serve as potential biomarkers for identifying senescent cells, thereby aiding in the development of novel therapeutic targets and senolytics.",

Our findings show a complex effect of mitochondrially targeted tamoxifen on mitochondrial function and integrity of senescent cells, including inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation and activity of respiratory complex IV. These changes result in activation of ferroptosis as the major mode of cell death, which results in rejuvenation of tissues.

Slow-progressing ALS patients exhibited higher counts of total T cells, Th, CD16-CD56bright NK cells, and CD16+CD56bright NK cells, while showing lower counts of CD16+CD56dim NK cells compared to fast-progressing ALS patients (P &;lt 0.05). ALS patients with lower CD16-CD56bright NK cell counts experienced a faster decline in motor function than those with higher counts (P &;lt 0.05). Elevated CD16-CD56bright NK cell counts were associated with improved ALS prognosis (HR, 0.73; 95% CI: 0.60-0.90; P &;lt 0.05). This study suggests that CD16-CD56bright NK cells play a protective role in ALS progression and prognosis, offering a potential therapeutic target for ALS.",

    "abstract": "Age-related alterations in the skeletal system are linked to decreased bone mass, a reduction in bone strength and density, and an increased risk of fractures and osteoporosis. Therapeutics are desired to stimulate bone regeneration and restore imbalance in the bone remodeling process. Quercetin (Qu), a naturally occurring flavonoid, induces osteogenesis; however, its solubility, stability, and bioavailability limit its therapeutic use. Nanoformulation can improve the physical properties of Qu and enhance its bioactivity and bioavailability. Further, localized delivery of Qu nanoformulations at the site of bone defects could ensure high local concentration, augmenting its osteogenic properties. Thus, this study aims to synthesize selenium nanoparticles-based Qu nanoformulation (Qu-SeNPs) and evaluate their osteogenic stimulation ability along with localized bone regeneration ability. Here, the spontaneously synthesized Qu-SeNPs showed uniform size distribution and rough flower-shaped morphology. The confocal images indicate improved cellular uptake and even cellular distribution of Qu-SeNPs in osteoblasts, resulting in increased osteogenic activity as indicated by enhanced expression of early and late osteoprogenitor differentiation markers. Qu-SeNPs also decreased osteoblasts' RANKL/OPG ratio and inhibited osteoclast formation. Mechanistically, Qu-SeNPs activate critical signaling pathways, including WNT and BMP, and utilize the miR-206/Connexin43 pathway to enhance osteogenesis. In vivo, experiments utilizing a drill-hole bone defect model in mice indicate that hydrogel-mediated localized delivery of Qu-SeNPs significantly accelerates bone defect healing. Thus, well-characterized and mechanistic, detailed synthesized Qu-SeNPs can restore bone remodeling, and Qu-SeNPs embedded in hydrogels may improve Qu cellular uptake and bioavailability in clinical settings, enabling innovative orthopedic and regenerative therapies for bone loss/defects.",

Patients with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of ≥4.0 ng/ml were prospectively enrolled between June 2014 and December 2016. 153 prostate nodules diagnosed by conventional ultrasound were prospectively enrolled and examined by CETRUS and RTSE before a biopsy. Multivariate logistic regression models were established for CETRUS, and CETRUS combined with RTSE to diagnose prostate malignancy. The diagnostic performances of CETRUS, RTSE, and their combined use were evaluated with the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The multivariate logistic regression for CETRUS combined with RTSE showed that enhanced strength, enhanced uniformity, and elasticity scores were the independent predictors of prostate malignancy. The area under the ROC curve of CETRUS combined with RTSE (0.921±0.023) was higher than that of CETRUS and RTSE (0.88±0.029 and 0.80±0.038, respectively; both p<0.05). Moreover, the sensitivity, accuracy and negative predictive value of CETRUS combined with RTSE were 92.1%, 86.2%, and 84.6%, respectively. The omission diagnostic rate of CETRUS combined with RTSE (7.9%) was reduced. And the diagnostic accuracy of CETRUS combined with RTSE was significantly higher than that of CETRUS and RTSE (p<0.05). While the diagnostic accuracy of CETRUS was close to the RTSE, the difference was not statistically significant (p>0.05). The combined RTSE with CETRUS approach significantly improved the sensitivity and overall accuracy for correctly identifying prostate cancer.",

    "abstract": "Liver hypoxia/ischemia injury leads to acute liver injury, delayed graft dysfunction, and failure during liver transplantation. Previous studies showed that autophagy is involved in liver hypoxia/ischemia injury. Our and others' studies have found that the damage-regulated autophagy modulator (DRAM) could induce the autophagic apoptosis. However, the role of DRAM regulating autophagy in liver hypoxia/ischemia injury remains unclear. The aim of this study was to determine whether DRAM is involved in oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced hepatocyte autophagic apoptosis. Normal hepatocytes (HL-7702) were treated with OGD while Balb/c mice underwent surgery to induce 70% liver ischemia. To evaluate the role of DRAM in hypoxia/ischemia-induced hepatic injury, DRAM siRNA was used to knockdown DRAM expression in cultured hepatocytes and a recombinant adenovirus vector expressing DRAM was used to overexpress DRAM in cultured hepatocytes in vitro and in the liver in vivo. Hepatic injury was analyzed by histopathological methods and measurement of hepatocyte enzyme release. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry and TUNEL staining. Several autophagic biomarkers were observed by western blot analysis. OGD and 70% hepatic ischemia significantly induced cell autophagy, apoptosis and DRAM expression in hepatocytes in vitro and in vivo. OGD-induced autophagic apoptosis was inhibited by 3-Methyladenine (3-MA). OGD-induced injury and autophagy in HL-7702 cells were significantly attenuated by DRAM knockdown but aggravated by DRAM overexpression in vitro. Similarly, DRAM overexpression increased ischemia-induced liver injury and hepatic apoptosis in vivo. Our data demonstrate that hypoxia/ischemia induces hepatic injury through a DRAM-dependent autophagic apoptosis pathway. These data also suggest that DRAM plays an important role in ischemia-induced liver injury and hepatocyte apoptosis.",

    "abstract": "Several epidemiological and clinical studies have shown that females with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have a higher mortality than males following primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). Many analyses of sex-based differences following STEMI have revealed conflicting results. Currently, more and more elderly patients with STEMI have undergone emergency interventional therapy. From January 2014 to December 2016, a total of 337 elderly patients with STEMI were enrolled in this study from two chest pain centers, and all patients underwent PPCI. Patients were divided into two groups: elderly females (n=117, mean age 73.4±9.6 years) and elderly males (n=220, mean age 71.7±8.6 years). The prevalence of diabetes was higher in females than in males (29.1% vs. 19.6%,P<0. 01). Typical ischemic chest pain was lower in females than in males (45.3% vs 57.3%, P<0.01). The number of nonsmokers was also significantly higher in females than in males (5.1% vs. 52.3%,P<0. 01). Serum creatinine (sCr) levels (87.6±17.4 umol/L vs 99.5±20.2 umol/L,P<0.01) and body mass index (23.8±2.7 vs 27.3±3.1, P<0.01) were lower in females than in males. The incidences of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in-hospital showed no significantly difference (P>0.05) between the two groups. However, the cumulative MACE showed a significant difference between the two groups in the 12-month follow-up (16.8% in male vs 12.8% in female, P = 0.04). Our results suggest that the PPCI is safe and effective in elderly female STEMI patients. The cumulative MACE in females are not higher than in males. PPCI are helpful in elderly STEMI patients.",

The rats were randomly divided into sham-operated (SH), SCI, and SCI and hyperbaric oxygen treatment (SCI + HBO) groups (n = 6 in each group). The Basso-Bettie-Bresnahan (BBB) score was used to evaluate motor function recovery, and DTI was performed on days 3, 7, 14, and 21 after surgery. BBB scores and FA values decreased significantly after SCI, while the two values significantly improved in the SCI + HBO group compared with the SCI group on days 7, 14, and 21. ADC increased significantly on days 14 and 21 postoperatively in the SCI group compared with the SH group but did not significantly differ between the SCI and SCI + HBO groups at any time point. BBB scores had the same variation trend with ADC values and FA values in all three groups. In the SH group, DTT showed a well-organized spinal cord, but the spinal cord showed interruptions at sites of injury after SCI. In conclusion, HBO promotes the recovery of neuronal function after SCI. Parameters of DTI, especially FA, can quantitatively evaluate the efficacy of HBO treatment in SCI, while DTT enables the visualization of the fiber tracking of spinal cord tracts.",

Thus, it is a compelling challenge to reliably and efficiently induce disease phenotypes of iPSCs-derived dopaminergic neurons to model late-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we applied a small molecule, hydroxyurea (HU), to promote the manifestation of disease relevant phenotypes in iPSCs-based modeling of PD. We established two iPS cell lines derived from two sporadic PD patients. Both patients-iPSCs-derived dopaminergic neurons did not display PD relevant phenotypes after 6 weeks culture. HU treatment remarkably induced ER stress on patients-iPSCs-derived dopaminergic neurons. Moreover, HU treatment significantly reduced neurite outgrowth, decreased the expression of p-AKT and its downstream targets (p-4EBP1 and p-ULK1), and increased the expression level of cleaved-Caspase 3 in patients-iPSCs-derived dopaminergic neurons. The findings of the present study suggest that HU administration could be a convenient and reliable approach to induce disease relevant phenotypes in PD-iPSCs-based models, facilitating to study disease mechanisms and test drug effects.",

However, the pathogenesis of AD remains to be fully understood and clinically effective treatments are lacking. Recent advances in single cell RNA sequencing offers an opportunity to characterize the heterogeneity of cell response and explore the molecular mechanism of complex diseases at a single cell level. Here, we present the application of the Ion AmpliSeq transcriptome approach to profile gene expression in single laser captured neurons as well as pooled 10 and 100 neurons from hippocampal CA1 of AD brains versus matching normal aged brains. Our results demonstrated the high sensitivity and high genome coverage of the AmpliSeq transcriptome in single cell sequencing. In addition to capturing the known changes related to AD, our data confirmed the diversity of neuronal profiles in AD brain, which allow the potential identification of single cell response that might be hidden in population analyses. Notably, we also revealed the extensive inhibition of olfactory signaling and confirmed the reduction of neurotransmitter receptors in AD hippocampus. We conclude that although single neuron data show more variance than data from 10 or 100 pooled neurons, single neuron data can be informative. These findings support the utility of the Ion AmpliSeq method for obtaining and analyzing gene expression data from single defined laser captured neurons.",

Choosing the right criteria to allocate the scarce ICU seems very challenging, being necessary a rapid, uncomplicated and universally accepted tool for patients' triage regarding access to lifesaving resources; one such criterion, which generates intense debates, is age. Under certain circumstances, it might seem appropriate to choose to treat a young over an old patient. The main advantage of this approach is the potential for long-term survival, implying an equal right to reach an advanced age. Many authors have given moral reasons to support it, mainly based on utilitarian ethics or on distributive justice. However, there are numerous counterarguments to this approach, which we will summarize in this article. We will show that age should never be used as a unique criterion for withholding/not initiating life-saving procedures, even in pandemics or cases in which healthcare resources are extremely scarce. This approach is based on fundamental Codes of Ethics, such as the WMA Code of Ethics or the Oath of Hippocrates and all physicians treating patients should obey them.",

    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) impacts approximately 20% of older adults, with many also experiencing sleep disorders, such as insomnia. Given the relationship between sleep and dementia, addressing sleep issues may offer an opportunity to treat reversible causes. There are two primary treatments for insomnia: behavioral-based (cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, CBT-I) and pharmacological interventions. Although CBT-I is recommended as first-line treatment for insomnia in older adults, sedative-hypnotics are more likely to be recommended than non-pharmacological treatments given their convenience and accessibility. However, there are significant concerns in prescribing medications to patients with MCI. To explore this disconnect, we reviewed insomnia treatments in older adults with MCI studies and current guidelines of pharmacological therapy. First, we reviewed studies presenting non-pharmacological treatment of insomnia in older adults with MCI. Although the search yielded over 4,000 non-duplicate titles, only one article presented data on non-pharmacological treatment of insomnia in MCI. The literature covering comorbid insomnia, CBT-I, and MCI is sparse. In contrast to review of non-pharmacological studies, studies on the pharmacological treatment of insomnia in older adults were ample. Finally, we reviewed international guidelines for pharmacological treatment of insomnia in cognitive disorders. More widely used pharmacological interventions show short-term effectiveness with problems of recurrence, ineffectiveness in inadvertent or purposeful chronic use, and adverse side effects. Despite evidence regarding adverse consequences, pharmacological treatment of insomnia remains the most common treatment for insomnia. Reflecting on age-related changes in older adults, particularly those with MCI, inappropriate or mismanagement of medication can lead to unnecessary complications. Further research examining effective behavioral-based sleep management options in older adults with cognitive impairment is needed with exploration of improved sleep on cognitive function.",

    "abstract": "Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is a tauopathy that affects individuals with a history of mild repetitive brain injury. The initial neuropathologic changes of CTE include perivascular deposition of phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau (p-tau). Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are known to carry pathogenic molecules, such as tau in Alzheimer's disease and CTE suggesting their contribution in pathogenesis. We therefore examined the protein composition of EVs separated from CTE and an age-matched control brain tissues by tandem mass tag -mass spectrometry. The reporter ion intensity was used to quantify the identified molecules. A total of 516 common proteins were identified among three sets of experiments. Weighted protein co-expression network analysis identified 18 unique modules of co-expressed proteins. Two modules were significantly correlated with total tau (t-tau) and p-tau protein in the isolated EVs and enriched in cellular components and biological processes for synaptic vesicle secretion and multivesicular body-plasma membrane fusion. The p-tau (Thr181) level is significantly higher in CTE EVs compared to control EVs and can distinguish the two groups with 73.6% accuracy. A combination of t-tau or p-tau (Thr181) with SNAP-25, PLXNA4 or UBA1, enhanced the accuracy to 96.3, 93.8 and 93.8%, respectively. Bioinformatic protein-protein interaction analysis revealed the functional interaction of SNAP-25 and PLXNA4 with tau, suggesting their interaction in CTE EVs. These data indicate the future application of identified EV proteins for monitoring the CTE risk assessments and understanding the EV-mediated disease progression mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension is the leading preventable risk factor for all-cause morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite antihypertensive medications have been available for decades, a big challenge we are facing is to increase the blood pressure (BP) control rate among the population. Therefore, it is necessary to search for new antihypertensive means to reduce the burden of disease caused by hypertension. Limb remote ischemic conditioning (LRIC) can trigger endogenous protective effects through transient and repeated ischemia on the limb to protect specific organs and tissues including the brain, heart, and kidney. The mechanisms of LRIC involve the regulation of the autonomic nervous system, releasing humoral factors, improvement of vascular endothelial function, and modulation of immune/inflammatory responses. These underlying mechanisms of LRIC may restrain the pathogenesis of hypertension through multiple pathways theoretically, leading to a potential decline in BP. Several existing studies have explored the impact of LRIC on BP, however, controversial findings were reported. To explore the potential antihypertensive effect of LRIC and the underlying mechanisms, we systematically reviewed the relevant articles to provide an insight into the novel therapy of hypertension.",

In the present study, morphometry of the TN and AN was performed on twenty post-mortem samples ranging from 12-90 years of age. The nerve samples were processed for resin embedding and toluidine blue stained thin (1µm) sections were used for estimating the total number of myelinated axons by fractionator and the cross sectional area of the nerve and the axons by point counting methods. We observed that the TN was covered by a well-defined epineurium and had ill-defined fascicles, whereas the AN had multiple fascicles with scanty epineurium. Both nerves contained myelinated and unmyelinated fibers of various sizes intermingled with each other. Out of the four age groups (12-20y, 21-40y, 41-60y and >61y) the younger groups revealed isolated bundles of small thinly myelinated axons. The total number of myelinated fibers in the TN and AN at various ages ranged from 1100-3000 and 1600-7000, respectively. There was no significant change in the cross-sectional area of the nerves or the axonal area of the myelinated nerves across the age groups. However, myelin thickness increased significantly in the AN with aging (one way ANOVA). The present study provides baseline morphometric data on the human TN and AN at various ages.",

To determine the structural defects in the brain that account for the decrease of slow wave sleep in NMOSD patients. Thirty-three NMOSD patients and 18 matched healthy controls (HC) were enrolled. Polysomnography was used to monitor slow wave sleep and three-dimensional T1-weighted MRIs were obtained to assess the alterations of grey matter volume. The percentage of deep slow wave sleep decreased in 93% NMOSD patients. Compared to HC, a reduction of grey matter volume was found in the bilateral thalamus of patients with a lower percentage of slow wave sleep (FWE corrected at cluster-level, p < 0.05, cluster size > 400 voxels). Furthermore, the right thalamic fraction was positively correlated with the decrease in the percentage of slow wave sleep in NMOSD patients (p < 0.05, FDR corrected, cluster size > 200 voxels). Our study identified that thalamic atrophy is associated with the decrease of slow wave sleep in NMOSD patients. Further studies should evaluate whether neurotransmitters or hormones which stem from thalamus are involved in the decrease of slow wave sleep.",

    "abstract": "A nonhuman primate model of ischemic stroke is considered as an ideal preclinical model to replicate various aspects of human stroke because of their similarity to humans in genetics, neuroanatomy, physiology, and immunology. However, it remains challenging to produce a reliable and reproducible stroke model in nonhuman primates due to high mortality and variable outcomes. Here, we developed a focal cerebral ischemic model induced by topical application of 50% ferric chloride (FeCl3) onto the MCA-M1 segment through a cranial window in the cynomolgus monkeys. We found that FeCl3 rapidly produced a stable intraarterial thrombus that caused complete occlusion of the MCA, leading to the quick decrease of the regional cerebral blood flow in 10 min. A typical cortical infarct was detected 24 hours by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and was stable at least for 1 month after surgery. The sensorimotor deficit assessed by nonhuman primate stroke scale was observed at 1 day and up to 3 months after ischemic stroke. No spontaneous revascularization or autolysis of thrombus was observed, and vital signs were not affected. All operated cynomolgus monkeys survived. Our data suggested that FeCl3-induced stroke in nonhuman primates was a replicable and reliable model that is necessary for the correct prediction of the relevance of experimental therapeutic approaches in human beings.",

We conducted a systematic review to examine the association of troponin with cognitive function, incidence of dementia and dementia-related outcomes.

Inclusion criteria were: (i) population-based cohort studies; (ii) troponin measured as determinant; and (iii) cognitive function in any metric or diagnosis of any type of dementia or dementia-related measures as outcomes. Fourteen studies were identified and included, with a combined total of 38,286 participants. Of these studies, four examined dementia-related outcomes, eight studies examined cognitive function, and two studies examined both dementia-related outcomes and cognitive function. Studies report higher troponin to be associated with higher prevalence of cognitive impairment (n=1), incident dementia (n=1), increased risk of dementia hospitalization (specifically due to vascular dementia) (n=1), but not with incident Alzheimer's Disease (n=2). Majority of studies on cognitive function found elevated troponin also associated with worse global cognitive function (n=3), attention (n=2), reaction time (n=1) and visuomotor speed (n=1), both cross-sectionally and prospectively. Evidence regarding the association between higher troponin and memory, executive function, processing speed, language and visuospatial function was mixed. This was the first systematic review on the association between troponin, cognitive function, and dementia. Higher troponin is associated with subclinical cerebrovascular damage and might act as a risk-marker of cognitive vulnerability.",

    "abstract": "Citicoline is the generic name of CDP-choline, a natural metabolite presents in all living cells. Used in medicine as a drug since the 1980-s, citicoline was recently pronounced a food ingredient. When ingested, citicoline breaks down to cytidine and choline, which become incorporated into their respective normal metabolic pathways. Choline is a precursor of acetylcholine and phospholipids; these is a neurotransmitter pivotal for learning and memory and important constituents of neuronal membranes and myelin sheaths, respectively. Cytidine in humans is readily converted to uridine, which exerts a positive effect on synaptic function and supports the formation of synaptic membranes. Choline deficiency has been found to be correlated with memory dysfunction. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies showed that citicoline intake improves brain uptake of choline in older persons, suggestive of that it shall help in reversing early age-related cognitive changes. In randomized, placebo-controlled trials of cognitively normal middle-aged and elderly persons, positive effects of citicoline on memory efficacy were found. Similar effects of citicoline on memory indices were also found in patients suffering from mild cognitive impairment and some other neurological diseases. Altogether, the aforementioned data provide complex and unambiguous evidence supporting the claim that oral citicoline intake positively influences memory function in humans who encounter age-related memory impairment also in the absence of any detectable neurological or psychiatric disease.",

    "abstract": "Hypoxia is an indispensable factor for cancer progression and is closely associated with the Warburg effect. Circular RNAs (CircRNA) have garnered considerable attention in molecular malignancy therapy as they are potentially important modulators. However, the roles of circRNAs and hypoxia in osteosarcoma (OS) progression have not yet been elucidated. This study reveals the hypoxia-sensitive circRNA, Hsa_circ_0000566, that plays a crucial role in OS progression and energy metabolism under hypoxic stress. Hsa_circ_0000566 is regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and directly binds to it as well as to the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ubiquitin ligase protein. Consequentially, binding between VHL and HIF-1α is impeded. Furthermore, Hsa_circ_0000566 contributes to OS progression by binding to HIF-1α (while competing with VHL) and by confers protection against HIF-1α against VHL-mediated ubiquitin degradation. These findings demonstrate the existence of a positive feedback loop formed by HIF-1α and Hsa_circ_0000566 and the key role they play in OS glycolysis. Taken together, these data indicate the significance of Hsa_circ_0000566 in the Warburg effect and suggest that Hsa_circ_0000566 could be a potential therapeutic target to combat OS progression.",

    "abstract": "Lens fibrosis is one of the leading causes of cataract in the elderly population. The primary energy substrate of the lens is glucose from the aqueous humor, and the transparency of mature lens epithelial cells (LECs) is dependent on glycolysis for ATP. Therefore, the deconstruction of reprogramming of glycolytic metabolism can contribute to further understanding of LEC epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In the present study, we found a novel pantothenate kinase 4 (PANK4)-related glycolytic mechanism that regulates LEC EMT. The PANK4 level was correlated with aging in cataract patients and mice. Loss of function of PANK4 significantly contributed to alleviating LEC EMT by upregulating pyruvate kinase M2 isozyme (PKM2), which was phosphorylated at Y105, thus switching oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. However, PKM2 regulation did not affect PANK4, demonstrating the downstream role of PKM2. Inhibition of PKM2 in Pank4-/- mice caused lens fibrosis, which supports the finding that the PANK4-PKM2 axis is required for LEC EMT. Glycolytic metabolism-governed hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) signaling is involved in PANK4-PKM2-related downstream signaling. However, HIF-1α elevation was independent of PKM2 (S37) but PKM2 (Y105) when PANK4 was deleted, which demonstrated that PKM2 and HIF-1α were not involved in a classic positive feedback loop. Collectively, these results indicate a PANK4-related glycolysis switch that may contribute to HIF-1 stabilization and PKM2 phosphorylation at Y105 and inhibit LEC EMT. The mechanism elucidation in our study may also shed light on fibrosis treatments for other organs.",

This period can span from those experiencing subtle motor deficits yet not meeting full diagnostic criteria or those with physiologic markers of disease alone. Several disease-modifying therapies have failed to show a neuroprotective effect. A common criticism is that neurodegeneration, even in the early motor stages, has advanced too far for neuro-restoration-based interventions to be effective. Therefore, identifying this early population is essential. Once identified, these patients could then potentially benefit from sweeping lifestyle modifications to alter their disease trajectory. Herein, we review the literature on risk factors for, and prodromal symptoms of, PD with an emphasis on ones which may be modifiable in the earliest possible stages. We propose a process for identifying this population and speculate on some strategies which may modulate disease trajectory. Ultimately, this proposal warrants prospective studies.",

Metformin has been the front-line anti-hyperglycemic drug of choice and the most widely prescribed medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. However, little is known about the effects of Metformin on HIV infection and replication. In this study, we showed that Metformin treatment enhanced HIV gene expression and transcription in HIV-transfected 293T and HIV-infected Jurkat and human PBMC. Moreover, we demonstrated that Metformin treatment resulted in increased CREB expression and phosphorylation, and TBP expression. Furthermore, we showed that Metformin treatment increased the recruitment of phosphorylated CREB and TBP to the HIV LTR promoter. Lastly, we showed that inhibition of CREB phosphorylation/activation significantly abrogated Metformin-enhanced HIV gene expression. Taken together, these results demonstrated that Metformin treatment increased HIV transcription, gene expression, and production through increased CREB phosphorylation and recruitment to the HIV LTR promoter. These findings may help design the clinical management plan and HIV cure strategy of using Metformin to treat type 2 diabetes, a comorbidity with an increasing prevalence, in people living with HIV.",

    "abstract": "Frailty describes the cumulative subtle health deficits leading to an increased vulnerability to insults among older individuals or disease-laden ones. The prevalence of frailty increases substantially and relentlessly over declining renal function. Frailty in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) carries kidney-specific risk factors, clinical correlates and outcomes associations, hence alternatively termed frail kidney phenotype by researchers. Pathogenetically, miRNAs participate extensively in the development and aggravation of frailty, including the occurrence of frail kidney phenotype in CKD patients. These understandings spark profound interest in discovering biomarkers for identifying this detrimental phenotype, and extracellular miRNAs emerge as potentially useful ones. Pilot studies identify promising miRNA candidates for evaluating intermediates and surrogates of frail kidney phenotype, and more are underway. Several potential miRNA species in biologic fluids, such as circulating miR-29b and miR-223 (as inflammatory markers), exosomal miR-16-5p, miR-17/92 cluster members, and miR-106-5p (for uremic vasculopathy), serum exosomal miR-203a-3p (for uremic sarcopenia) have been examined and can be promising choices. Nonetheless, there remains research gap in affirming the direct connections between specific miRNAs and frail kidney phenotype. This stems partially from multiple limitations less well acknowledged before. From this perspective, we further outline the limitations and precautions prior to validating specific extracellular miRNA(s) for this purpose, from the definition of frailty definition, the functional and tissue specificity of miRNAs, the severity of CKD, and various technical considerations. It is expected that more affirmative studies can be produced for extending the utility of extracellular miRNAs in predicting frail kidney phenotype.",

DA is modulated in pre-synaptic nerve terminals to remain stable. To be specific, proteins at DA release sites that have a function of synthesizing and packing DA in cytoplasm, modulating release and reingestion, and changing excitability of neurons, display regional discrepancies that uncover relevancy of the observed sensitivity to neurodegenerative changes. Although the reasons of a majority of PD cases are still indistinct, heredity and environment are known to us to make significant influences. For decades, genetic analysis of PD patients with heredity in family have promoted our comprehension of pathogenesis to a great extent, which reveals correlative mechanisms including oxidative stress, abnormal protein homeostasis and mitochondrial dysfunction. In this review, we review the constitution of presynaptic vesicle related to DA homeostasis and describe the genetic and environmental evidence of presynaptic dysfunction that increase risky possibility of PD concerning intracellular vesicle transmission and their functional outcomes. We summarize alterations in synaptic vesicular proteins with great involvement in the reasons of some DA neurons highly vulnerable to neurodegenerative changes. We generalize different potential targets and therapeutic strategies for different pathogenic mechanisms, providing a reference for further studies of PD treatment in the future. But it remains to be further researched on this recently discovered and converging mechanism of vesicular dynamics and PD, which will provide a more profound comprehension and put up with new therapeutic tactics for PD patients.",

    "abstract": "Diets that restrict caloric or protein intake offer a variety of benefits, including decreasing the incidence of cancer. However, whether such diets pose a substantial therapeutic benefit as auxiliary cancer treatments remains unclear. We determined the effects of severe protein depletion on tumorigenesis in a <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> intestinal tumor model, using a human RAF gain-of-function allele. Severe and continuous protein restriction significantly reduced tumor growth but resulted in premature death. Therefore, we developed a diet in which short periods of severe protein restriction alternated cyclically with periods of complete feeding. This nutritional regime reduced tumor mass, restored gut functionality, and rescued the lifespan of oncogene-expressing flies to the levels observed in healthy flies on a continuous, fully nutritious diet. Furthermore, this diet reduced the chemotherapy-induced stem cell activity associated with tumor recurrence. Transcriptome analysis revealed long-lasting changes in the expression of key genes involved in multiple major developmental signaling pathways. Overall, the data suggest that recurrent severe protein depletion effectively mimics the health benefits of continuous protein restriction, without undesired nutritional shortcomings. This provides seminal insights into the mechanisms of the memory effect required to maintain the positive effects of protein restriction throughout the phases of a full diet. Finally, the repetitive form of strict protein restriction is an ideal strategy for adjuvant cancer therapy that is useful in many tumor contexts.",

Results showed that both ComBat and TS-GLM significantly reduced the effects of the MRI site, model, and protocol for diffusion metrics while maintaining the intersubject biological effects. The harmonization power of TS-GLM based on TS data model is more powerful than that of ComBat. In conclusion, our research demonstrated that although ComBat and TS-GLM harmonization approaches were effective at reducing the scanner effects of the site, model, and protocol for DTI and NODDI metrics in WM, they exhibited high retainability of biological effects. Therefore, we suggest that, after harmonizing DTI and NODDI metrics, a multisite study with large cohorts can accurately detect small pathological changes by retaining pathological effects.",

    "abstract": "Aging is a natural process that affects all living organisms, including humans. Aging is a complex process that involves the gradual deterioration of various biological processes and systems, including the cardiovascular system. Vascular aging refers to age-related changes in blood vessels. These changes can increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, and stroke. Recently, an exercise-induced muscle factor, irisin, was found to directly improve metabolism and regulate the balance of glucolipid metabolism, thereby counteracting obesity and insulin resistance. Based on a growing body of evidence, irisin modulates vascular aging. Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) serves as a pivotal cellular energy sensor and metabolic modulator, acting as a central signaling cascade to coordinate various cellular processes necessary for maintaining vascular homeostasis. The vascular regulatory effects of irisin are closely intertwined with its interaction with the AMPK pathway. In conclusion, understanding the molecular processes used by irisin to regulate changes in vascular diseases caused by aging may inspire the development of techniques that promote healthy vascular aging. This review sought to describe the impact of irisin on the molecular mechanisms of vascular aging, including inflammation, oxidative stress, and epigenetics, from the perspective of endothelial cell function and vascular macroregulation, and summarize the multiple signaling pathways used by irisin to regulate vascular aging.",

In the present study, we used a tracer-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method to quantitatively analyze the effects of glioma growth on ISF drainage. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into six groups (n = 6). C6 glioma cells were implanted into either the caudate nucleus or thalamus of rats and then were examined 10 or 20 days after implantation. The two control groups were treated with vehicle. A tracer was injected into the caudate nucleus of control rats and rats with gliomas growing in the thalamus for 10 or 20 days. The tracer was similarly injected into the thalamus of control rats and rats implanted with gliomas in the caudate nucleus. The diffusion and clearance parameters of the tracer were calculated using tracer-based MRI techniques. We found that glioma implanted in the caudate nucleus significantly decreased the speed of the ISF flow in thalamus. With the growth of the glioma in thalamus, the drainage route of the brain ISF flow was altered in the caudate nucleus, but the speed of the flow was not significantly changed. These findings indicate that tracer-based MRI is a promising technique for optimizing the interstitial administration of therapeutics aimed at treating brain gliomas.",

    "abstract": "Many oncogenes are involved in the progression from low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs) to high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs); which greatly increases the risk of cervical cancer (CC). Thus, a reliable biomarker for risk classification of LSILs is urgently needed. The prolyl isomerase Pin1 is overexpressed in many cancers and contributes significantly to tumour initiation and progression. Therefore, it is important to assess the effects of cancer therapies that target Pin1. In our study, we demonstrated that Pin1 may serve as a biomarker for LSIL disease progression and may constitute a novel therapeutic target for CC. We used a the novel Pin1 inhibitor KPT-6566, which is able to covalently bind to Pin1 and selectively target it for degradation. The results of our investigation revealed that the downregulation of Pin1 by shRNA or KPT-6566 inhibited the growth of human cervical cancer cells (CCCs). We also discovered that the use of KPT-6566 is a novel approach to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin (DDP) against CCCs in vitro and in vivo. We showed that KPT-6566-mediated inhibition of Pin1 blocked multiple cancer-driving pathways simultaneously in CCCs. Furthermore, targeted Pin1 treatment suppressed the metastasis and invasion of human CCCs, and downregulation of Pin1 reversed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of CCCs via the c-Jun/slug pathway. Collectively, we showed that Pin1 may be a marker for the risk of progression to HSIL and that inhibition of Pin1 has anticancer effects against CC.",

    "abstract": "The molecular processes of aging are very heterogenic and not fully understood. Studies on rare progeria syndromes, which display an accelerated progression of physiological aging, can help to get a better understanding. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) caused by mutations in the ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member 6 (ABCC6) gene shares some molecular characteristics with such premature aging diseases. Thus, this is the first study trying to broaden the knowledge of aging processes in PXE patients. In this study, we investigated aging associated biomarkers in primary human dermal fibroblasts and sera from PXE patients compared to healthy controls. Determination of serum concentrations of the aging biomarkers eotaxin-1 (CCL11), growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) showed no significant differences between PXE patients and healthy controls. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) showed a significant increase in serum concentrations of PXE patients older than 45 years compared to the appropriate control group. Tissue specific gene expression of GDF11 and IGFBP3 were significantly decreased in fibroblasts from PXE patients compared to normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF). IGFBP3 protein concentration in supernatants of fibroblasts from PXE patients were decreased compared to NHDF but did not reach statistical significance due to potential gender specific variations. The minor changes in concentration of circulating aging biomarkers in sera of PXE patients and the significant aberrant tissue specific expression seen for selected factors in PXE fibroblasts, suggests a link between ABCC6 deficiency and accelerated aging processes in affected peripheral tissues of PXE patients.",

We developed a method to estimate the level of objects set heterogeneity with reference to particular parameters and applied it to type II diabetes and heart disease, as examples of age-related systemic dysfunctions. The Friedman test was used to establish the existence of heterogeneity. The Newman-Keuls multiple comparison method was used to determine clusters. The normalized Shannon entropy was used to provide the quantitative evaluation of heterogeneity. There was obtained an estimate for the heterogeneity of the diagnostic parameters in healthy subjects, as well as in heart disease and type II diabetes patients, which was strongly related to their age. With aging, as with the diseases, the level of heterogeneity (entropy) was reduced, indicating a formal analogy between these phenomena. The similarity of the patterns in aging and disease suggested a kind of “early aging” of the diseased subjects, or alternatively a “disease-like” aging process, with reference to these particular parameters. The proposed method and its validation on the chronic age-related disease samples may support a way toward a formal mathematical relation between aging and chronic diseases and a formal definition of aging and disease, as determined by particular heterogeneity (entropy) changes.",

Many of the neuropathological features of early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) including senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are also present in people with DS as a result of triplication of the amyloid precursor gene on chromosome 21. Evidence suggests that harboring one or both apolipoprotein E4 (<i>APOE4</i>) alleles may increase the risk for AD due to the proteolytic cleavage of apoE4 and a subsequent loss of function. To investigate a role for the apoE proteolysis <i>in vivo</i>, we compared three autopsy groups; 7 DS with AD neuropathology cases over 40 years, 5 young DS cases without AD pathology under 40 years (YDS) and 5 age-matched control cases over 40 years by immunohistochemistry utilizing an antibody that detects the amino-terminal fragment of apoE. Application of this antibody, termed the amino-terminal apoE fragment antibody (nApoECF) revealed labeling of pyramidal neurons in the frontal cortex of YDS cases, whereas in the DS-AD group, labeling with nApoECF was prominent within NFTs. NFT labeling with nApoECF was significantly greater in the hippocampus versus the frontal cortex in the same DS-AD cases, suggesting a regional distribution of truncated apoE. Colocalization immunofluorescence experiments indicated that 52.5% and 53.2% of AT8- and PHF-1-positive NFTs, respectively, also contained nApoECF. Collectively, these data support a role for the proteolytic cleavage of apoE in DS and suggest that apoE fragmentation is closely associated with NFTs.",

This study evaluated the relationship between FES-I Fear of Falling Survey results, self-reported activity restrictions via the SF-36 survey, and scores recorded by portable, inexpensive clinical assessment tools (CATs) during dynamic functional tasks. Low scores during these tasks may indicate functional deficits that put patients at risk for falls and subsequent fragility fractures. Forty-one subjects (20 fragility fracture patients, 21 controls without history of fragility fractures) over the age of 50 were recruited from three outpatient orthopaedic clinics. All subjects were administered a FES-I Fear of Falling Survey, a portion of an SF-36 survey, and tested using three different portable CATs: the Wii Balance Board, iPod Level Belt and Saehan Squeeze Hand Grip Dynamometer. There were several measured variables that showed a moderate correlation with Fear of Falling scores. Of note, correlations between FES-I scores and maximum hand grip strength for both the dominant hand (R= -0.302, p=0.069) and non-dominant hand (R= -0.309, p=0.059), as well as maximum anterior-posterior sway measured by the iPod Level Belt (R=0.320, p=0.056) were found to be marginally significant. In addition, the correlation between FES-I and average anterior-posterior sway was found to be significant (R=0.416, p=0.012). The Nintendo Wii and iPod Level Belt are relatively inexpensive, portable tools that can assess patients for subtle deficits during dynamic functional tasks. The results indicate that these tools can provide a more objective measure of a patient's limitations during daily activities such as walking by assigning them a numerical value and correlating this value to physical deficits that impact balance and coordination. In the future, CATs may also have a role in predicting outcomes and in individualizing care, therapy, and at-home preventive measures.",

In this study, 68 female patients with DNB and 40 female normal controls were subjected to a nerve conduction study (NCS) of all four limbs and the BCR test. The data were analyzed and compared, and the corresponding diagnostic sensitivities were discussed. Mean BCR latency for female DNB patients was significantly prolonged, compared to that of the control group, suggesting pudendal nerve injuries in female DNB patients. Moreover, DNB patients were categorized according to the diabetes course. Compared to that of Group A (diabetes course < 5 y), the mean BCR latency was significantly prolonged in Group B (diabetes course between 5 and 10 y) and then further prolonged in Group C (diabetes course > 10 y), which were all longer than the control group. Furthermore, compared with that of the controls, the mean BCR latency was prolonged in DNB patients with or without NCS abnormalities in limbs. Nevertheless, no significant difference was observed in BCR latency between DNB patients with and without NCS abnormalities. Significantly increasing trends were also observed in the NCS and BCR abnormality rates along with increased diabetes course. Most importantly, compared with the NCS of limbs, the BCR test was more sensitive in diagnosing DNB in the female subjects. Overall, our findings suggest that the BCR test would help to assess the pudendal nerve injury in female DNB patients, which might be a potential diagnostic tool in the clinic.",

Overweight and obese subjects aged 40-59 years consumed a MCD (approximately 100 kcal/day deficit, n=47) or a weight-maintenance diet (control, n=47) in a randomized, controlled design with a three-year clinical intervention period and plasma samples were analyzed by using UPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometry. The three-year MCD intervention resulted in weight loss (-8.87%) and significant decreases in HOMA-IR and TG. The three-year follow-up of the MCD group showed reductions in the following 13 metabolites: L-leucine; L-phenylalanine; 9 lysoPCs; PC (18:0/20:4); and SM (d18:0/16:1). The three-year MCD group follow-up identified increases in palmitic amide, oleamide, and PC (18:2/18:2). Considering the age-related alterations in the identified metabolites, the MCD group showed a greater decrease in L-leucine, L-phenylalanine, and SM (d18:0/16:1) compared with those of the control group. Overall, the change (Δ) in BMI positively correlated with the ΔTG, ΔHOMA-IR, ΔL-leucine, and ΔSM (d18:0/16:1). The ΔHOMA-IR positively correlated with ΔTG, ΔL-leucine, ΔL-phenylalanine, and ΔSM (d18:0/16:1).

    "abstract": "Presently, the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic is driving the world towards a devastating total failure of the healthcare system. The purpose of the review is to search for the studies reporting on the implication of herd immunity into a naïve population through age specific mass vaccination. This review is based on selected publications on the effect herd immunity to COVID 19 in communities. We searched published scientific articles, review articles, reports, published in 2020 as well as read some basic, cult publications related to establishment of indirect immunity to a population. We have focused on use of application of vaccine induced herd immunity into community to confer indirect immunity against COVID-19 and searched on electronic databases, including PubMed (http://www.pubmed.com), Scopus (http://www.scopus.com), Google Scholar (http://www.scholar.google.com), Web of Science (www.webofscience.com) and Science Direct by using key words such as Herd immunity, indirect or passive immunization, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), severe acute respiratory syndrome, coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and immune-technique. This review proposes the implication of mass vaccination-induced herd immunity in a population to curb the infection, and to every individual in a given population irrespective of their age.",

    "abstract": "In patients with COVID-19, frailty has been shown to better predict outcomes than age alone. We investigated factors associated with mechanical ventilation (MV) during hospitalization for COVID-19 among older adults in a multicentre study during the first two waves in Italy. Using data from the FRACOVID project, we included consecutive patients admitted to the participating centres during the first and second waves. We recorded sociodemographics, comorbidities, time since symptom onset, ventilatory support at admission, and chest X-ray findings. Frailty was assessed using a frailty index (FI). Results are reported as hazard ratios (HR) with 95%CI. 1,344 patients were included; 487 females (36.2%), median age 68 (56; 79) years; 52.4% had hypertension, 10.6% had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 15.2% were obese. Median FI was 0.088 (0.03, 0.20), and 67% had bilateral consolidations at admission. Median time since symptom onset was 7 days (4, 10). During hospitalization, 47 patients (3.6%, 95%CI 0.33-13.6%) received MV. Multivariable Cox regression analysis found that the likelihood of intubation decreased with increasing age (HR 0.945 (95%CI 0.921-0.969), p<0.0001), while heart rate >110bpm (HR 3.429 (95%CI 1.583-7.429), p=0.0018), and need for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at admission (HR 2.626 (95%CI 1.330-5.186), p=0.0054) were significantly associated with a greater likelihood of intubation. Older patients are less likely to receive intubation, while those with heart rate >110 bpm and need for CPAP at admission are more likely to receive MV during hospitalization for COVID-19.",

A multicentre observational study was performed to evaluate the impact of age and geriatric parameters on 30-day mortality in patients aged ≥60 years of age. Patients or next of kin were asked to answer a phone questionnaire assessing geriatric covariates 1 month before ICU admission. Among 290 screened patients, 231 were included between March 7 and May 7, 2020. In univariate, factors associated with lower 30-day survival were: age (per 10 years increase; OR 3.43, [95%CI: 2.13-5.53]), ≥3 CIRS-G grade ≥2 comorbidities (OR 2.49 [95%CI: 1.36-4.56]), impaired ADL, (OR 4.86 [95%CI: 2.44-9.72]), impaired IADL8 (OR 6.33 [95%CI: 3.31-12.10], p<0.001), frailty according to the Fried score (OR 4.33 [95%CI: 2.03-9.24]) or the CFS ≥5 (OR 3.79 [95%CI: 1.76-8.15]), 6-month fall history (OR 3.46 [95%CI: 1.58-7.63]). The final multivariate model included age (per 10 years increase; 2.94 [95%CI:1.78-5.04], p<0.001) and impaired IADL8 (OR 5.69 [95%CI: 2.90-11.47], p<0.001)). Considered as continuous variables, the model led to an AUC of 0.78 [95% CI: 0.72, 0.85]. Age and IADL8 provide independent prognostic factors for 30-day mortality in the considered population. Considering a risk of death exceeding 80% (82.6% [95%CI: 61.2% - 95.0%]), patients aged over 80 years with at least 1 IADL impairment appear as poor candidates for ICU admission.",

    "abstract": "Fibrosis is a pathological manifestation of wound healing that replaces dead/damaged tissue with collagen-rich scar tissue to maintain homeostasis, and complications from fibrosis contribute to nearly half of all deaths in the industrialized world. Ageing is closely associated with a progressive decline in organ function, and the prevalence of tissue fibrosis dramatically increases with age. Despite the heavy clinical and economic burden of organ fibrosis as the population ages, to date, there is a paucity of therapeutic strategies that are specifically designed to slow fibrosis. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is an environment-sensing transcription factor that exacerbates aging phenotypes in different tissues that has been brought back into the spotlight again with economic development since AhR could interact with persistent organic pollutants derived from incomplete waste combustion. In addition, gut microbiota dysbiosis plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, and microbiota-associated tryptophan metabolites are dedicated contributors to fibrogenesis by acting as AhR ligands. Therefore, a better understanding of the effects of tryptophan metabolites on fibrosis modulation through AhR may facilitate the exploitation of new therapeutic avenues for patients with organ fibrosis. In this review, we primarily focus on how tryptophan-derived metabolites are involved in renal fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, hepatic fibrosis and cardiac fibrosis. Moreover, a series of ongoing clinical trials are highlighted.",

    "abstract": "As the body's immunity declines with age, elderly-hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 might be at higher mortality risk. Therefore, the aim of this prospective study was to examine the possible risk factors (demographic, social or comorbidities) most associated with mortality one-year after diagnosis of COVID-19. Routine data were collected from a cohort of hospitalized adults with severe COVID-19. The primary endpoint was mortality at one-year after diagnosis of COVID-19. We used a Cox proportional hazard model to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) for both all-cause and specific cardiorespiratory mortality. A fully adjusted model included sex, socioeconomic status, institutionalization status, disability, smoking habit, and comorbidities as confounders. A total of 368 severe cases hospitalized on average 67.3 ± 15.9 years old were included. Participants aged ≥ 71 years had significantly higher HRs for all-cause mortality (adjusted HRs = 2.86, 95%CI: 2.01-4.07) and cardiorespiratory mortality (adjusted HRs = 2.86, 95%CI: 1.99-4.12). The association between age and mortality after diagnosis of COVID-19 due to both all-causes and cardiorespiratory mortality showed a consistent dose-response fashion. Institutionalization, disability, and socioeconomic status also showed a significant association with mortality. In conclusion, aging itself was the most important risk factor associated with mortality one year after diagnosis of COVID-19. People with disabilities, institutionalized or low socioeconomic status are significantly more likely to die after COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "In previous studies, we reported the presence of a large number of low-molecular-weight (LMW) peptides in aged and cataract human lens tissues. Among the LMW peptides, a peptide derived from αA-crystallin, αA66-80, was found in higher concentration in aged and cataract lenses. Additional characterization of the αA66-80 peptide showed beta sheet signature, and it formed well-defined unbranched fibrils. Further experimental data showed that αA66-80 peptide binds α-crystallin, impairs its chaperone function, and attracts additional crystallin proteins to the peptide α-crystallin complex, leading to the formation of larger light scattering aggregates. It is well established that Aβ peptide exhibits cell toxicity by the generation of hydrogen peroxide. The αA66-80 peptide shares the principal properties of Aβ peptide. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to determine whether the fibril-forming peptide αA66-80 has the ability to generate hydrogen peroxide. The results show that the αA66-80 peptide generates hydrogen peroxide, in the amount of 1.2 nM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> per µg of αA66-80 peptide by incubation at 37°C for 4h. We also observed cytotoxicity and apoptotic cell death in αA66-80 peptide-transduced Cos7 cells. As evident, we found more TUNEL-positive cells in αA66-80 peptide transduced Cos7 cells than in control cells, suggesting peptide-mediated cell apoptosis. Additional immunohistochemistry analysis showed the active form of caspase-3, suggesting activation of the caspase-dependent pathway during peptide-induced cell apoptosis. These results confirm that the αA66-80 peptide generates hydrogen peroxide and promotes hydrogen peroxide-mediated cell apoptosis.",

    "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is one of the most frequent cause of hospitalization in elderly and often coexists with concurrent geriatric syndromes, like cognitive disturbances; various pathophysiological mechanisms are shared by HF and cognitive decline, notably a substrate of low-grade inflammation. We investigated whether SNPs in the purinergic receptor (P2X<sub>7</sub>R) and apolipoprotein (APO) E genes, both involved in a series of inflammatory responses, are associated to HF or cognitive impairment and are able to predict post-discharge mortality in the elderly. We prospectively analyzed 198 patients (age 85 ± 8 years, predominantly females) admitted to a Geriatric unit for acute HF, whose diagnosis was based on clinical signs, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) values and ecocardiography in uncertain diagnosis (BNP values between 100 and 400 pg/mL); cognitive performance was assesed by Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ). In all the participants, SNPs rs208294 and rs3751143 for P2X<sub>7</sub>R gene and rs429558 and rs7412 for APOE gene were assessed. Information on all-cause mortality was adjudicated by medical records review 36 months after discharge. We found no relationship between P2X<sub>7</sub>R and APOE polymorphisms and 36-month post-discharge mortality; a better outcome for overall survival was observed in patients with BNP values below the median (281 pg/mL) (<i>p</i>=0.002) persisting after adjustment for renal function and age, and in those with cognitive impairment (<i>p</i><0.001). Patients harboring APOE-ε4 genotype showed higher BNP concentrations than noncarriers (1289.9 ± 226.9 <i>vs</i> 580.5 ± 90.2 pg/mL respectively,<i>p</i>=0.004), whereas none of the studied SNPs were associated to impairment in cognitive performance. In conclusion, neither P2X<sub>7</sub>R or APOE genotype seem to predict long-term mortality in elderly patients. Interestingly, APOE-ε4 genotype was associated to higher BNP values, suggesting a putative interaction between genetic and biochemical markers in identifying people at risk for HF.",

According to the report released by United States Census Bureau in June 2017, there are around 50 million residents aged 65 years and over as of 2016. Among the multiple healthcare challenges, kidney disease is a significant one because of its high burden, high cost and low awareness. Medicare spending on chronic kidney disease for 65 plus aged patients exceeded $ 50 billion in 2013. Different studies based on different calculations have estimated that at least one-third of chronic kidney disease patients are aged above 65 years. Most of the chronic kidney disease patients have multiple medical co-morbidities but geriatric syndromes are added factors that may be challenging for nephrologists. There is scarcity of well-trained geriatricians and in most instances, nephrologists take over the role of internist or geriatrician. This article outlines the need and importance of collaboration and coordination between geriatrics and nephrology for the best patient care and better healthcare outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Loss-of-function mutations of progranulin are associated with frontotemporal dementia in humans, and its deficiency in mice is a model for this disease but with normal life expectancy and mild cognitive decline on aging. The present study shows that aging progranulin deficient mice develop progressive polydipsia and polyuria under standard housing conditions starting at middle age (6-9 months). They showed high water licking behavior and doubling of the normal daily drinking volume, associated with increased daily urine output and a decrease of urine osmolality, all maintained during water restriction. Creatinine clearance, urine urea, urine albumin and glucose were normal. Hence, there were no signs of osmotic diuresis or overt renal disease, other than a concentrating defect. In line, the kidney morphology and histology revealed a 50% increase of the kidney weight, kidney enlargement, mild infiltrations of the medulla with pro-inflammatory cells, widening of tubules but no overt signs of a glomerular or tubular pathology. Plasma vasopressin levels were on average about 3-fold higher than normal levels, suggesting that the water loss resulted from unresponsiveness of the collecting tubules towards vasopressin, and indeed aquaporin-2 immunofluorescence in collecting tubules was diminished, whereas renal and hypothalamic vasopressin were increased, the latter in spite of substantial astrogliosis in the hypothalamus. The data suggest that progranulin deficiency causes nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in mice during aging. Possibly, polydipsia in affected patients - eventually interpreted as psychogenic polydipsia - may point to a similar concentrating defect.",

    "abstract": "Despite its beneficial role on insulin resistance and atherosclerosis, adiponectin has been frequently reported as an independent positive predictor of cardiovascular mortality. Very few information is available regarding adiponectin isoforms and mortality, in particular in advanced aging. Baseline serum levels of Total Adiponectin and its circulating isoforms (HMW-, MMW-, LMW-Adiponectin) were measured in 97 old patients (mean age: 79 years). Patients were followed up for all-cause mortality (study end-point) for an average of 76.4 ± 37.3 months. A positive association was observed for LMW-Ad and all-cause mortality (HR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.05-1,22, p: 0.002). After multivariate adjustment for age, sex and a previous history of myocardial infarction, higher levels of LMW-Ad were significantly associated with all-cause mortality (HR: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.02-1.21; p: 0.017). Interestingly neither total adiponectin neither the other two circulating isoforms (MMW- and HMW-Ad) showed any significant association with the study end-point. Our data suggest that the association between high serum adiponectin levels and increased mortality rate in elderly is contingent to an unbalanced circulating levels of adiponectin isoforms. The present results support the hypothesis that high levels of Low Molecular Weight adiponectin are a biomarker for mortality risk in very old patients.",

    "abstract": "Most human populations are undergoing a demographic transition regarding their age structure. This transition is reflected in chronic non-communicable diseases featuring among the main contributors to burden of disease. Considering that the aging process is a major risk factor for such conditions, understanding the mechanisms underlying aging and age-related diseases is critical to develop strategies to impact human health at population and/or individual-levels. Two different aspects of aging process (namely, telomere shortening and DNA damage accumulation) were shown to interact in positively impacting mice median survival. However, strategies aimed at translating such knowledge into actual human health benefits have not yet been discussed. In this manuscript, we present potential exposures that are suited for population-level interventions, and contextualize the roles of population (based on behavioral exposures) and individual-level (based on small-molecule administration) anti-aging interventions in different levels of disease prevention. We suggest that exposures such as moderate wine consumption, reducing calorie intake and active lifestyle are potentially useful for primordial and primary prevention, while small-molecules that activate telomerase and/or tumor suppression responses are more suited for secondary and tertiary prevention (although important for primary prevention in specific population subgroups). We also indicate the need of studying the impacts, on aging and age-related diseases, of different combinations of these exposures in well-conducted randomized controlled trials, and propose Mendelian randomization as a valuable alternative to gather information in human populations regarding the effects of potential anti-aging interventions.",

This study aimed to investigate the association between the resistin single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and the susceptibility to CI in the Chinese Han population. A total of 550 CI patients and 313 healthy controls were genotyped. Nine SNPs of the resistin gene previously shown were sequenced and assessed for an association with CI. The numbers of GG genotype carriers of rs3219175 and rs3486119 in the CI group were significantly higher than those in the control group among the middle-aged group (aged 45-65), at 76% vs 67.9% (P=0.025) and 75.5% vs 67.9% (P=0.031). rs3219175 and rs34861192 were associated with CI in the dominant and superdominant models according to the genetic model analysis (P<0.05). Meanwhile, there was strong linkage disequilibrium among the rs34124816, rs3219175, rs34861192, rs1862513, rs3745367, 180C/G and rs3745369 sites.

In the Chinese Han middle-aged population, the GG gene type carriers of the resistin gene sites rs3219175 and rs34861192 had a high risk for CI onset, especially in middle-aged male patients and SAO CI in all middle-aged patients.",

    "abstract": "Post-transcriptional regulation and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play vital roles in the occurrence of secondary injury after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Therefore, we identified RBPs distinctively expressed after ICH by screening and determined thioredoxin1 (Txn1) as one of the most distinctive RBPs. We employed an ICH model and in vitro experiments to investigate the role of Txn1 in ICH. Firstly, we found that Txn1 was mainly expressed in microglia and neurons in the central nervous system, and its expression was significantly reduced in perihematomal tissue. Additionally, adeno-associated virus (AAV) carrying Txn1 was injected into the ICH rat model. Our results showed that overexpression of Txn1 reduced secondary injury and improved outcome in the ICH rat model. Moreover, to understand the therapeutic mechanism of Txn1 after ICH, we performed RNA immunoprecipitation combined with high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that Txn1 binds to inflammation- and apoptosis-related mRNAs and affects gene expression through RNA splicing and translation. Finally, RNA pull-down assays and in vitro experiments confirmed that Txn1 binds to metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), leading to reduced inflammation and apoptosis. Our study suggests that Txn1 is a potential therapeutic target for alleviating ICH-induced brain injury.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is associated with a multitude of acquired or genetic neurological disorders characterized by a predisposition to spontaneous recurrent seizures. An estimated 15 million patients worldwide have ongoing seizures despite optimal management and are classified as having refractory epilepsy. Early-life seizures like those caused by perinatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) remain a clinical challenge because although transient, they are difficult to treat and associated with poor neurological outcomes. Pediatric epilepsy syndromes are consistently associated with intellectual disability and neurocognitive comorbidities. HIE and arterial ischemic stroke are the most common causes of seizures in term neonates and account for 7.5-20% of neonatal seizures. Standard first-line treatments such as phenobarbital (PB) and phenytoin fail to curb seizures in ~50% of neonates. In the long-term, HIE can result in hippocampal sclerosis and temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), which is the most common adult epilepsy, ~30% of which is associated with refractory seizures. For patients with refractory TLE seizures, a viable option is the surgical resection of the epileptic foci. Novel insights gained from investigating the developmental role of Cl",

    "abstract": "The association of preceding antithrombotic therapy with outcomes of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) has not been well clarified. We investigated the characteristics and associations of prior antithrombotic therapy (oral anticoagulants, antiplatelet therapy or both) in outcomes of in-hospital patients with ICH. Data were derived from the Chinese Stroke Center Alliance (CSCA) database. Enrolled patients were categorized by the different types of preceding antithrombotic therapy: antiplatelet therapy (APT), oral coagulants (OAs), both OAs and APT use and no-antithrombotic therapy (no-ATT). Among 85705 patients enrolled, 4969 (5.8%), 720 (0.8%), 905 (1.1%) and 79111 (92.3%) patients were on APT, OAs, both OAs and APT, and non-ATT respectively prior to their admission. Crude in-hospital death was 149(3.0%), 41(5.7%), 46(5.1%) and 1781(2.3%) in APT, OAs, both OAs and APT, and non-ATT groups, respectively (P<0.0001). Multivariate analysis revealed that patients in prior OAs (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-3.21; P=0.0091) and both OAs and APT groups (aOR 1.92, 95% CI 1.17-3.15, P=0.0094) were associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality compared with the non-ATT group, but not in those who were on APT (aOR 1.12, 95% 0.93-1.36, P=0.2372). In the subgroup analysis, a stronger association between prior OAs and in-hospital death was found among patients who were older ≥ 65 years (P for interaction is 0.0382). In this nationwide prospective study, prior OAs and concomitant use of OAs and APT but not prior ATP were associated with increased odds of in-hospital mortality compared with ICH patients who were on no-ATT.",

    "abstract": "Poland is among the European countries currently facing the second wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A lot of studies confirm the mortality rate of COVID-19 increases with age. Considering the particularly adverse outcomes of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, preventing infections should be the priority for public health professionals. One method for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections among eldery people may involve implementing procedures for limiting the spread of the pathogen, and providing education to medical staff, so as to bridge any gaps in knowledge on virus spread and post-infection or post-exposure management. Three residential medical centers in Poland were selected for evaluation of existing medical procedures to identify any errors in the current procedures applied for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the facility. The project involved 4 steps: (1) Audit of the existing medical procedures; (2) Knowledge evaluation for the staff (n=185) in the senior- and disabled care facilities, administration of a knowledge test developed by the authors to assess knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 prevention; (3) Training for medical staff; (4) Updates and implementation of procedures. The knowledge test conducted revealed a lack of knowledge of medical personnel about SARS-CoV-2. The deficiencies of the surveyed group varied depending on the place of employment. Almost half of the surveyed medical centers (center No. 1 (52%) vs. center No. 2 (44%) vs. center No. 3(59%)) believed that elderly people usually do not show symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the facility No. 1, 70% of respondents did know that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted via the alimentary route compared to center No. 2 and No. 3 where knowledge about it showed only 28,9% and 24,8% responders, respectively. Also, in facility No. 1, the least among the studied group (67%) knew that people with comorbidities were at risk of covid-19 compared to respondents from facility No. 2 and 3, where, respectively, 100% and 93% had such knowledge. Only 33.3% of the staff of facility No. 1 knew how to deal with a patient who will present symptoms such as temp >38 degrees with coughing or dyspnea while in institution No. 2 and 3, this knowledge was slightly higher at 44% and 60% respectively. The audit of the existing hygiene procedures used to limit the risk of SARS-CoV-2 spread demonstrated a number of shortcomings. Employees at the residential medical care centers included in the study had gaps in knowledge on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The training sessions implemented at the next stage improved knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 infections. Additionally, decisions were made to modify certain procedures and introduce new ones to better prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.",

However, a large proportion of patients failed to achieve their ideal LDL-C goals after statins use. Ezetimibe, a newly non-statin lipid-lowering agent, is an inhibitor of exogenous cholesterol absorption. Whereby, ezetimibe plus statins may reduce LDL-C more strongly than statins alone. Differed from any other papers published previously, which only involved ezetimibe plus statins for coronary heart disease, the highlight of this paper is to summarize the efficacy and safety of ezetimibe plus statins in all kinds of ASVD subtypes and their related diseases, mainly included aortic atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular and peripheral artery diseases.

The effect of STA-MCA bypass depends not only on the patency of anastomosis, but also on integrity and functional capacity of the donor artery. In the present prospective study, we investigated the effect of extensive stripping STA adventitia and fasciae on hemodynamic function in STA-MCA bypass of moyamoya disease patients. Twenty patients (n=8 in control group, n=12 in stripping group) of moyamoya disease were subjected to STA-MCA end-to-side direct anastomosis. Perfusion unit (PU) values of the cortex were measured and recorded using a Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) for 5 days. Computed tomography perfusion was performed to determine blood flow before and after bypass. No patient experienced significant neurologic deficits associated with neurosurgical complications. LDF demonstrated that adventitial stripping group had higher cerebral blood flow increase than control group. The adventitia stripping group tends to have higher rate of increased cerebral perfusion after bypass than non-stripping group. Furthermore, the ultrasound examination at 3 days after bypass demonstrated that the adventitial stripping group has a tendency of bigger STA and higher peak systolic velocity than control group. Our result suggests that stripping adventitia of STA improves hemodynamics of STA-MCA bypass in moyamoya disease.",

    "abstract": "Human tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is mainly caused by genetic mutations of tuberous TSC1or TSC2. Recent studies found that TSC1 deficiency promoted classical M1 macrophage polarization. However, whether TSC1 regulates other inflammatory cytokine expression in lipopolysaccharidem (LPS)-stimulated macrophages is unknown. Herein, we studied the cytokine expression profile of wild-type (WT) and TSC1-deleted macrophages after LPS stimulation in vitro and the pathogenesis of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice with myeloid-specific TSC1 deletion (TSC1cKO mice). We found that TSC1-deficient macrophages exhibited the enhanced secretion of interleukin-17A (IL-17A), IL-17F, and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) in response to LPS stimulation in vitro. This is in contrast to LPS-stimulated WT macrophages, which usually do not. Importantly, TSC1cKO mice exhibited exacerbated DSS-induced acute colitis with severer symptoms. MTOR deletion or rapamycin treatment significantly reversed the enhanced expressions of IL-17A, IL-17F, and IFN-γ in LPS-stimulated TSC1-deficient macrophages in vitro and rescued the enhanced DSS-induced colitis in TSC1cKO mice, indicating that TSC1 deficiency increased these cytokine productions in an mTOR-dependent manner. RNA-sequencing and molecular studies indicated that TSC1 deficiency enhanced the aerobic glycolysis process and the activities of mTOR-STAT3-RORγT pathway in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Inhibition of aerobic glycolysis, STAT3, or RORγT reversed IL-17 and IFN-γ expression in LPS-treated TSC1-deficient macrophages. Thus, TSC1 is essential for macrophages to shut down IL-17A, IL-17F, and IFN-γ expression during LPS stimulation by suppressing the aerobic glycolysis process and mTOR-STAT3, RORγT, and T-bet pathways. The present study uncovered the key role of TSC1 in shutting down IL-17A, IL-17F, and IFN-γ expressions in LPS-treated macrophages.",

We conducted a retrospective study of three outbreaks of COVID-19, occurring during the waves of the initial pre-Alpha, Delta and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants, in one NH in suburban Belgrade, Serbia. All staff and 95% residents were vaccinated in February 2021, mostly with BBIBP-CorV, and two thirds were boosted with a third dose in August 2021. COVID-19 was diagnosed by positive PCR and/or antigen test. After the first outbreak, 80 affected individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. The first outbreak involved 64/126 (50.8%) residents and 45/64 (70.3%) staff, the second 22/75 (29.3%) residents and 3/40 (7.5%) staff, and the third involved 36/110 (32.7%) residents and 19/56 (33.9%) staff. Clinical presentation ranged from asymptomatic to severe, with severe cases referred to hospital ICUs. Deaths occurred only in residents, and the case fatality rate was 31.2%, 9.1% and 0%, respectively in outbreaks 1, 2 and 3. Specific IgG antibodies were detected in all 35 residents and 44 of the 45 staff, and higher IgG levels were detected in the residents (417.3±273.5) than in the staff (201.9±192.9, p<0.0001) despite a double difference in age (79.0±7.4 vs. 40.1±11.5 years).

    "abstract": "Atherosclerosis (AS), the formation of fibrofatty lesions in the vessel wall, is the primary cause of heart disease and stroke and is closely associated with aging. Disrupted metabolic homeostasis is a primary feature of AS and leads to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which is an abnormal accumulation of unfolded proteins. By orchestrating signaling cascades of the unfolded protein response (UPR), ER stress functions as a double-edged sword in AS, where adaptive UPR triggers synthetic metabolic processes to restore homeostasis, whereas the maladaptive response programs the cell to the apoptotic pathway. However, little is known regarding their precise coordination. Herein, an advanced understanding of the role of UPR in the pathological process of AS is reviewed. In particular, we focused on a critical mediator of the UPR, X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), and its important role in balancing adaptive and maladaptive responses. The XBP1 mRNA is processed from the unspliced isoform (XBP1u) to the spliced isoform of XBP1 (XBP1s). Compared with XBP1u, XBP1s predominantly functions downstream of inositol-requiring enzyme-1α (IRE1α) and transcript genes involved in protein quality control, inflammation, lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and calcification, which are critical for the pathogenesis of AS. Thus, the IRE1α/XBP1 axis is a promising pharmaceutical candidate against AS.",

Insomnia episodes may be associated with neurocognitive, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, and metabolic disorders. Epidemiological evidence also revealed the association of insomnia with oncologic and asthmatic complications, which has been indicated as bidirectional. Two therapeutic approaches including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and drugs-based therapies are being practiced for a long time. However, the adverse events associated with drugs limit their wide and long-term application. Further, Traditional Chinese medicine, acupressure, and pulsed magnetic field therapy may also provide therapeutic relief. Notably, the recently introduced cryotherapy has been demonstrated as a potential candidate for insomnia which could reduce pain, by suppressing oxidative stress and inflammation. It seems that the synergistic therapeutic approach of cryotherapy and the above-mentioned approaches might offer promising prospects to further improve efficacy and safety. Considering these facts, this perspective presents a comprehensive summary of recent advances in pathological aetiologies of insomnia including COVID-19, and its therapeutic management with a greater emphasis on cryotherapy.",

Translational mouse models that adequately mimic underlying physiological pathways could accelerate research but are scarce. Here, we investigated the translational value of three potential mouse models for sarcopenia, namely partial immobilized (to mimic sedentary lifestyle), caloric restricted (CR; to mimic malnutrition) and a combination (immobilized & CR) model. C57BL/6J mice were calorically restricted (-40%) and/or one hindleg was immobilized for two weeks to induce loss of muscle mass and function. Muscle parameters were compared to those of young control (4 months) and old reference mice (21 months). Transcriptome analysis of quadriceps muscle was performed to identify underlying pathways and were compared with those being expressed in aged human vastus lateralis muscle-biopsies using a meta-analysis of five different human studies. Caloric restriction induced overall loss of lean body mass (-15%, p<0.001), whereas immobilization decreased muscle strength (-28%, p<0.001) and muscle mass of hindleg muscles specifically (on average -25%, p<0.001). The proportion of slow myofibers increased with aging in mice (+5%, p<0.05), and this was not recapitulated by the CR and/or immobilization models. The diameter of fast myofibers decreased with aging (-7%, p<0.05), and this was mimicked by all models. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the combination of CR and immobilization recapitulated more pathways characteristic for human muscle-aging (73%) than naturally aged (21 months old) mice (45%). In conclusion, the combination model exhibits loss of both muscle mass (due to CR) and function (due to immobilization) and has a remarkable similarity with pathways underlying human sarcopenia. These findings underline that external factors such as sedentary behavior and malnutrition are key elements of a translational mouse model and favor the combination model as a rapid model for testing the treatments against sarcopenia.",

    "abstract": "Huntington disease (HD) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by a trinucleotide CAG repeat expansion in the <i>HTT</i> gene that codes for the protein huntingtin (HTT in humans or Htt in mice). HTT is a multi-functional, ubiquitously expressed protein that is essential for embryonic survival, normal neurodevelopment, and adult brain function. The ability of wild-type HTT to protect neurons against various forms of death raises the possibility that loss of normal HTT function may worsen disease progression in HD. Huntingtin-lowering therapeutics are being evaluated in clinical trials for HD, but concerns have been raised that decreasing wild-type HTT levels may have adverse effects. Here we show that Htt levels modulate the occurrence of an idiopathic seizure disorder that spontaneously occurs in approximately 28% of FVB/N mice, which we have called FVB/N Seizure Disorder with SUDEP (FSDS). These abnormal FVB/N mice demonstrate the cardinal features of mouse models of epilepsy including spontaneous seizures, astrocytosis, neuronal hypertrophy, upregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and sudden seizure-related death. Interestingly, mice heterozygous for the targeted inactivation of <i>Htt </i>(<i>Htt+/- </i>mice) exhibit an increased frequency of this disorder (71% FSDS phenotype), while over-expression of either full length wild-type HTT in YAC18 mice or full length mutant HTT in YAC128 mice completely prevents it (0% FSDS phenotype). Examination of the mechanism underlying huntingtin's ability to modulate the frequency of this seizure disorder indicated that over-expression of full length HTT can promote neuronal survival following seizures. Overall, our results demonstrate a protective role for huntingtin in this form of epilepsy and provide a plausible explanation for the observation of seizures in the juvenile form of HD, Lopes-Maciel-Rodan syndrome, and Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. Adverse effects caused by decreasing huntingtin levels have ramifications for huntingtin-lowering therapies that are being developed to treat HD.",

However, the effect of exercise can differ among individuals, even with exercise of the same type and intensity. Therefore, this study aims to confirm whether endurance training (ETR) has the same health-promoting effects on the musculoskeletal and hematopoietic systems regardless of age. Ten weeks of ETR improved endurance exercise capacity, with increased skeletal muscle mitochondrial enzymes in both young and old mice. In addition, age-related deterioration of muscle fiber size and bone microstructure was improved. The expression levels of myostatin, muscle RING-finger protein-1, and muscle atrophy F-box in skeletal muscle and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ in the femur increased with age but decreased after ETR. ETR differentially modulated hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) depending on age; ETR induced HSC quiescence in young mice but caused HSC senescence in old mice. ETR has differential effects on modulation of the musculoskeletal and hematopoietic systems in old mice. In other words, endurance exercise is a double-edged sword for successful aging, and great effort is required to establish exercise strategies for healthy aging.",

    "abstract": "Aging is one of the most serious risk factors for glaucoma, and according to age-standardized prevalence, glaucoma is the second leading cause of legal blindness worldwide. Cellular senescence is a hallmark of aging that is defined by a stable exit from the cell cycle in response to cellular damage and stress. The potential mechanisms underlying glaucomatous cellular senescence include oxidative stress, DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, defective autophagy/mitophagy, and epigenetic modifications. These phenotypes interact and generate a sufficiently stable network to maintain the cell senescent state. Senescent trabecular meshwork (TM) cells, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and vascular endothelial cells reportedly accumulate with age and stress and may contribute to glaucoma pathologies. Therapies targeting the suppression or elimination of senescent cells have been found to ameliorate RGC death and improve vision in glaucoma models, suggesting the pivotal role of cellular senescence in the pathophysiology of glaucoma. In this review, we explore the biological links between aging and glaucoma, specifically delving into cellular senescence. Moreover, we summarize the current data on cellular senescence in key target cells associated with the development and clinical phenotypes of glaucoma. Finally, we discuss the therapeutic potential of targeting cellular senescence for the management of glaucoma.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer, more precisely high-grade serous ovarian cancer, is one of the most lethal age-independent gynecologic malignancies in women worldwide, regardless of age. There is mounting evidence that there is a link between telomeres and the RIF1 protein and the proliferation of cancer cells. Telomeres are hexameric (TTAGGG) tandem repeats at the tip of chromosomes that shorten as somatic cells divide, limiting cell proliferation and serving as an important barrier in preventing cancer. RIF1 (Replication Time Regulation Factor 1) plays, among other factors, an important role in the regulation of telomere length. Interestingly, RIF1 appears to influence the DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway. However, detailed knowledge regarding the interplay between RIF1 and telomeres and their degree of engagement in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is still elusive, despite the fact that such knowledge could be of relevance in clinical practice to find novel biomarkers. In this review, we provide an update of recent literature to elucidate the relation between telomere biology and the RIF1 protein during the development of ovarian cancer in women.",

    "abstract": "Arterial stiffness is an indicator of vascular health, influenced by both pathological conditions and physiological determinants, noticeably age. Augmentation index (AI) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) are used among others to assess arterial stiffness. Several risk factors may contribute to pathologically increase arterial stiffness and produce early vascular aging. Our study aims to assess the impact of individual risk factors on vascular health, evaluating the distribution of PWV and AI values in a cohort of adult people without modifiable cardiovascular risk factors while analyzing their role in accelerating vascular ageing. We performed a secondary analysis of a Swiss population-based research project, which took place in 2017 and 2018. Of the 1202 participants originally enrolled, 1097 were included in the final sample. The population was divided into without (n=388) and with risk factors (n=709), based on the presence of the following: smoking, diabetes, previous cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease stage 3 or more, LDL cholesterol ≥ 4.11 or treatment with hypolipidemic drugs, hypertension or treatment with antihypertensive drugs, and metabolic syndrome. Tonometric and oscillometric devices were employed to assess PWV, and the 75th percentiles of PWV and AI in the population without risk factors were calculated to identify cut-offs for the logistic regression analysis. We developed nomograms by assigning a numerical score to each independent prognostic factor; the total score estimating the probability of PWVs and AIs being over the defined cut-offs. Patients with hypertension, diabetes, and obesity showed higher PWV values (p < 0.001). In the univariate logistic regression, factors predictive for higher PWV values were diabetes, CVDs, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension, while CVDs, antihyperlipidemic treatment, hypertension, and increased BMI were predictive in the multivariate logistic regression. Smoking did not significantly influence arterial stiffness parameters. The present study provides reference values for PWV and AI in subjects without modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and, through nomograms, a risk score stratification to assess the impact of individual risk factors on vascular health.",

Given the putative significance of NLRP2 in orchestrating neuroinflammation, further inquiry is needed to gain a better understanding of its connectome, hence its specific targeting may hold a promising therapeutic implication. Therefore, bioinformatical approach for extracting information, specifically in the context of neuropathologies, is also undoubtedly preferred. To the best of our knowledge, there is no review study selectively targeting only NLRP2. Increasing, but still fragmentary evidence should encourage researchers to thoroughly investigate this inflammasome in various animal- and human models. Taken together, herein we aimed to review the current literature focusing on the role of NLRP2 inflammasome in the nervous system and more importantly, we provide an algorithm-based protein network of human NLRP2 for elucidating potentially valuable molecular partnerships that can be the beginning of a new discourse and future therapeutic considerations.",

We also overexpressed MAVS in murine chondrogenic ATDC5 cells and analyzed the cell viability and apoptosis. Rs11795343 (P-allele: 0.063394) in RIG-I, rs17857295 (P-allele: 0.073518) and rs7262903 (P-allele: 0.054052, P-genotype: 0.067930) in MAVS were marginally associated with OA. Rs7269320 (P-allele: 0.014783, P-genotype: 0.03272) in MAVS was significant associated with OA. Further analyses in different genders indicated that rs7262903 (P-allele: 0.017256, P-genotype: 0.045683) and rs7269320 (P-allele: 0.013073, P-genotype: 0.038881) are significantly associated with OA in female group.

Furthermore, forced expression of MAVS could suppress the viability and promote the apoptosis of ATDC5 chondrogenic cells. In conclusion, this study indicated that RIG-I and MAVS are probably associated with OA in the females of Chinese Han population.

It is characterized by profound decreases in metabolic rate, body temperature and physiological functions. Studies have shown that animals in hibernation can resist neurological damage. Here, we aimed to study whether hypoxia can induce a hibernation-like state in a traditionally non-hibernating animal and whether it is neuroprotective. All procedures were conducted according to international guidelines on laboratory animal safety. Mice C57BL/6 (19-21g) were placed into a 125 mL jar with fresh air and the jar was sealed with a rubber plug. For each run, the tolerance limit was judged by the animals' appearance for \"air hunger\". The animal was removed from the jar as soon as its first gasping breath appeared and was moved to another fresh-air-containing jar of similar volume. This procedure was performed in four runs. The hypoxia exposure significantly decreased oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) consumption, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) production, respiratory rate and heart rate. Meanwhile, rectal temperature reached a minimum of 12.7±2.56°C, which is lower than a wide range of ambient temperatures. The mimicked hibernation decreased the infarct size in a focal cerebral ischemia mouse model. Our findings suggest the possibility of inducing suspended animation-like hibernation states for medical applications post injury.",

A study of pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 (PYCR1) deficiency, which causes a progeroid syndrome, may not only shed light on its genetic contribution to autosomal recessive cutis laxa (ARCL) but also help elucidate the functional mechanisms associated with aging. In this study, we used RNA-Seq technology to examine gene expression changes in primary skin fibroblasts from healthy controls and patients with <i>PYCR1</i> mutations. Approximately 22 and 32 candidate genes were found to be up- and downregulated, respectively, in fibroblasts from patients. Among the downregulated candidates in fibroblasts with <i>PYCR1</i> mutations, a strong reduction in the expression of 17 genes (53.1%) which protein products are localized in the extracellular space was detected. These proteins included several important ECM components, periostin (POSTN), elastin (ELN), and decorin (DCN); genetic mutations in these proteins are associated with different phenotypes of aging, such as cutis laxa and joint and dermal manifestations. The differential expression of ten selected extracellular space genes was further validated using quantitative RT-PCR. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that some of the affected genes may be associated with cardiovascular system development and function, dermatological diseases and conditions, and cardiovascular disease. <i>POSTN</i>, one of the most downregulated gene candidates in affected individuals, is a matricellular protein with pivotal functions in heart valvulogenesis, skin wound healing, and brain development. Perturbation of PYCR1 expression revealed that it is positively correlated with the POSTN levels. Taken together, POSTN might be one of the key molecules that deserves further investigation for its role in this progeroid neurocutaneous syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Worldwide COVID-19 infection poses an enormous risk to public health and an alarming global socioeconomic burden. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with underlying health conditions as well as on the elderly population is extensive and effective strategies are needed to understand the mechanism behind it. Cellular senescence defines as an irreversible cell cycle arrest due to DNA damage leading to accumulation of senescent cells in the elderly population and may result in worsening of COVID-19 mediated increased mortality. However, whether this variation in senescence levels, in different aged populations, translation to COVID-19 infection is unknown. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has been recently identified to be responsible for inducing pathogenic signals, although a clear understanding of how the host receptor interacts with SARS-CoV-2 protein and mediates the immune responses is not clear. In this review, we address the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 and the cellular senescence responding immune response to pathogenic SARS-CoV-2. We provide a prospective summary of what to expect and how to brace the possible immunological strategy to protect against COVID-19 infection. The review majorly explores an underline mechanism of how senescent cells trigger a hyperimmune inflammatory response and cause high mortality in aging people could serve as a potential aid to alleviate the treatment for elderly battling COVID-19 infection.",

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common and debilitating joint disease of advanced age and has no universally effective therapy. Here, we demonstrate that systemic transplantation of adult multipotent muscle-derived stem/progenitor cells (MDSPCs)-isolated from young mice-rejuvenates the knee articular cartilage (AC) of naturally aged mice. This intervention reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Tnf and Il1a) and catabolic matrix-degrading proteinases (Mmp3 and Mmp13) in aged cartilage. Treatment with young MDSPCs also increased expression of pro-regenerative (Col2a1 and Acan) and prolongevity genes (Pot1b), including those associated with chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation, cartilage growth, and telomere protection. Indeed, the AC of MDSPC-treated mice exhibited reduced age-related histological pathologies. Importantly, the reduced mobility and arthritis-related gait dysfunctions of aged mice were also ameliorated by this treatment. Together, our findings demonstrate the rejuvenating effects of systemic transplantation of young MDSPCs on aging AC-at the molecular, tissue, and functional levels. This suggests that MDSPCs, or their secreted factors, may represent a novel therapy that can increase mobility and function in aged or OA patients.",

    "abstract": "Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), a highly specialized class of innate immune cells that serve as rapid sensors of danger signals in circulation or in lymphoid tissue are well studied. However, there remains knowledge gaps about age-dependent changes of pDC function in the intestinal mucosa. Here, we report that under homeostatic conditions, the proportion of pDC expressing C-C chemokine receptor 9 (CCR9) in the intestinal intraepithelial cell (iIEC) population is comparable between young (2-4 months) and aged (18-24 months) mice, but the absolute numbers of iIEC and pDC are significantly lower in aged mice. Employing the classic model of acute endotoxemia induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), we found a decrease in the proportion and absolute number of intraepithelial pDC in both young and aged mice despite the LPS-induced increased expression of the chemokine C-C ligand 25 (CCL25), the ligand of CCR9, in the intestinal mucosa of young mice. In adoptive transfer experiments, a significantly lower number of pDC was retained into the intestinal layer of aged host mice after LPS administration. This was associated with recoverable pDC numbers in the intestinal lumen. Furthermore, co-adoptive transfer of young and aged pDC into young hosts also showed significantly lower retention of aged pDC in the epithelial layer compared to the co-transferred young pDC. Collectively, these data show age-associated changes in mucosal CCL25 gene expression and in pDC number. These may underlie the reported inadequate responses to gastrointestinal pathogens during chronologic aging.",

Cardiac autophagy commonly decreases with aging and is accompanied by the accumulation of misfolded proteins and dysfunctional organelles, which are undesirable to the cell. Reduction of autophagy over time leads to aging-related cardiac dysfunction and is inversely related to longevity. However, despite the increasing interest in autophagy in cardiac diseases and aging, the process remains an undervalued and disregarded object in calcific valvular disease. Neither the nature through which autophagy is triggered nor the interplay between autophagic machinery and targeted molecules during aortic valve calcification are fully understood. Recently, the upregulation of autophagy has been shown to result in cardioprotective effects against cell death as well as its origin. Here, we review the evidence that shows how autophagy can be both beneficial and detrimental as it pertains to aortic valve calcification in the heart.",

ACS patients show acquired immune system abnormalities that resemble the characteristics of autoimmune dysfunction described in the elderly. This study aimed to investigate the role of premature CD4+ T cells senescence in ACS and the underlying mechanism. We compared the immunological status of 25 ACS patients, 15 young healthy individuals (C1), and 20 elderly individuals with absence of ACS (C2). The percentages of CD4+ T lymphocyte subsets (including naïve, regulatory, memory and effector T cells) in peripheral blood were analyzed. In ACS patients, a significant expansion of CD4+CD28null effector T cells and a decline of CD4+CD25+CD62L+Treg cells were observed. In addition, patients with ACS showed an accelerated loss of CD4+CD45RA+CD62L+ naïve T cells and a compensatory increase in the number of CD4+CD45RO+ memory T cells. ACS patients demonstrated no significant difference in frequency of T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) compared to age-matched healthy volunteers. The expression of p16Ink4a was increased while CD62L was decreased in CD4+CD28null T cells of ACS patients. Compared to healthy donors, ACS patients demonstrated the lowest telomerase activity in both CD4+CD28+and CD4+CD28null T cells. The serum levels of C-reactive protein, Cytomegalovirus IgG, Helicobactor pylori IgG and Chlamydia pneumonia IgG were significantly higher in ACS patients. The results suggested that the percentage of CD4+ T cell subpopulations correlated with chronic infection, which contributes to immunosenescence. In conclusion, chronic infection induced senescence of premature CD4+T cells, which may be responsible for the development of ACS.",

The current study examined the gray matter (GM) voxel based morphometric (VBM) correlates of cognitive and clinical severity scores in patients with AD. The study included 34 patients with AD according to NINCDS/ADRDA AD criteria and 28 matched elderly controls. All subjects were clinically evaluated using Hindi Mental Status Examination (HMSE), Everyday Abilities Scale for India (EASI) and the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale. The structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data were acquired using a 3 Tesla MRI scanner and VBM analysis was performed using VBM5.1 toolbox. The patients with AD had significantly lower GM volume, white matter volume and total brain volume as compared to controls. The HMSE scores were positively correlated (p=0.009) and EASI (p=0.04) & CDR (p=0.0004) were negatively correlated with the total GM volumes in patients with AD. The VBM analysis revealed diffuse GM atrophy in patients with AD. Frontal& temporal GM volumes were positively correlated with the HMSE scores. Thus the results of the study replicate the previous observations of generalized GM atrophy, in an Indian sample with AD. The cognitive decline, clinical dementia severity and impairment in activities of daily living were correlated whole brain GM and WM volumes as well as with specific brain regional atrophy in AD. However further studies with larger samples & with more detailed cognitive evaluation are required for confirmation & validation of the relationship between regional morphometric abnormalities and cognitive deficits in AD.",

    "abstract": "Adaptable and consistent neural function relies at least in part on the ongoing repair of oxidative damage that can accumulate in the brain over a lifespan. To determine whether forebrain neuron-targeted knockout of AP endonuclease 1 (APE1), a critical enzyme in the base excision DNA repair pathway, contributes to neuronal impairments, we generated APE1 conditional knockout mice under the control of the CamKIIα promotor (APE1 cKO). Spatial learning and memory were tested using the Morris water maze. Synaptic markers, including synapsin, vGLUT, GABA1, and GAD were immunostained and quantified. Dendritic morphology and number were characterized using Golgi staining. Long-term potentiation (LTP) was measured in slices from the 6-month-old brain. APE1 cKO mice did not significantly differ from WT mice in the learning phase of the Morris water maze, but performed significantly worse during the memory phase of the Morris water maze. vGLUT, GABA1, and GAD immunostaining was significantly decreased in APE1 cKO mice without concomitant changes in the number of synapsin-positive structures, suggesting that neural networks may be impaired but not at the level of total presynaptic structures. Dendrites were reduced both in number and length of spines in APE1 cKO mice. APE1 cKO brain slices exhibited decreased LTP induction compared to WT brain slices. Together, these data indicate that the conditional loss of APE1 in forebrain neurons leads to a phenotype consistent with expedited brain aging.",

Regulation of transportation is a novel strategy for treating ECS blockage-related brain diseases, but few techniques have been developed to date. In this study, we established a novel approach for accelerating the drainage of brain interstitial fluid (ISF) in the ECS using minimally invasive surgery, in which a branch of the external carotid artery is separated and implanted epidurally (i.e., epidural arterial implantation [EAI]) to promote a pulsation effect on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the frontoparietal region. Tracer-based magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate the changes in ISF drainage in rats 7 and 15 days post-EAI. The drainage of the traced ISF from the caudate nucleus to ipsilateral cortex was significantly accelerated by EAI. Significant increases in the volume fraction of the ECS and molecular diffusion rate were demonstrated using the DECS-mapping technique, which may account for the mechanisms underlying the changes in brain ISF. This study provides a novel perspective for encephalopathy treatment via the brain ECS.",

However, it is not clear if the differences in the disease severity and mortality shown by male and female COVID-19 patients are associated with these HICs. Here, we review the literature and present supporting laboratory data on the gender differences associated with various HICs in COVID-19 patients. We measured plasma/serum levels of various HIC specific clinical markers in severe male (N=132) and severe female (N=78) COVID-19 patients. The result revealed that all clinical markers were highly elevated above the normal in both male and female COVID-19 patients. However, a comparison of AUROC (area under the receiving operative characteristics) of specific clinical markers revealed that elevation in serum ferritin (marker for macrophage activation), and neutrophil to lymphocyte (N/L) ration (marker for hematological dysfunction) was much higher in male compared to the female COVD-19 patients. Further, univariate regression analyses revealed that male COVID-19 patients had two times higher risks than female patients for developing macrophage activation (OR 2.36, P=0.004)), hematological dysfunctions (OR 2.23, P=0.01), coagulopathy (OR 2.10, P=0.01), and cytokinaemia (OR 2.31, P=0.01). Similar results were obtained in bivariate analyses. Survival curve analysis showed that male COVID-19 patients had relatively short survival duration than female COVID-19 patients (hazard ratio 2.0, 95% CI 1.3-3.7, P=0.01). The above findings suggest that the high mortality rate in male COVID-19 patients compared to the female could be due to higher prevalence and severity of various HICs.",

This escalation in osteoclastic activity accelerates bone resorption, which in turn contributes to age-related bone loss and metabolic bone disorders, notably osteoporosis. Our study confirms that elevated IL-19 expression promotes aging-induced bone loss in aged mice and sheds light on the regulatory mechanisms upstream of IL-19 expression and secretion. Primarily, it is the methylation status of the IL-19 gene's promoter region that impacts Atonal BHLH Transcription Factor 1 (Atoh1)'s ability to bind to the promoter. We found that this specific mechanism involves reduced expression and binding affinity of Dnmt1 to the IL-19 promoter region. The findings of our study suggest that targeting IL-19 could be a potential strategy for managing bone loss-related conditions and enhance the current understanding of how DNA methylation levels contribute to age-related bone loss.",

However, the transduction profile and therapeutic efficiency after endothelial cell injury such as ischemic stroke is largely unknown. In this study, we tested the transduction profiles of AAV-PHP.eB and developed intravenous NeuroD1 gene therapy to treat ischemic stroke in mice. We found that AAV-PHP.eB-GFP control virus crossed the BBB and infected brain cells efficiently in normal brain. However, after stroke, AAV-PHP.eB-GFP control virus was highly restricted in the blood vessels. Surprisingly, after switching to therapeutic vector AAV-PHP.eB-NeuroD1-GFP, the viral vector successfully crossed blood vessels and infected brain cells. Using Tie2-cre transgenic mice, we demonstrated that NeuroD1 regulated endothelial gene expression to modulate AAV-PHP.eB transduction. Following the changes of signaling pathways in endothelial cells, NeuroD1 effectively protected BBB integrity, attenuated neuroinflammation, inhibited neuron apoptosis and rescued motor deficits after ischemic stroke. Moreover, NeuroD1 over-expression in brain cells further promoted neural regeneration. These results indicate that intravenous gene therapy using AAV-PHP.eB for ischemic stroke differs from intracranial gene therapy and NeuroD1 intravenous delivery using AAV-PHP.eB efficiently rescue both vascular damage and neuronal loss, providing an advancing therapeutic treatment for stroke.",

    "abstract": "Physical Activity (PA) is often associated with better overall health status, especially in older adults. Numerous pieces of evidence indicate that PA would be more beneficial when applied in conjunction with Cognitive Training (CT) either simultaneously (i.e., in Dual-Task [DT]) or sequentially. Nonetheless, the underlying mechanisms of such benefits remain elusive. To help delve deeper into their understanding, we developed a cognitive-motor DT paradigm in young adult mice and subsequently tested its effect in old age. Three groups of young adults C57BL/6J mice (3.5 months of age; n=10/group) were required. They were given cognitive tasks, either alone (Control) or in combination with PA which was administered either sequentially (SeqT group) or simultaneously (DT group). Mice were trained in a touchscreen chamber: first on a Visual Discrimination (VD) learning task, then on its Reversal (RVD) which assesses cognitive flexibility alongside procedural learning. PA was given through a homemade treadmill, designed to fit in the touchscreen chambers and set at 9 m/min. Fourteen months later, we further evaluated the effects of PA administered in both DT and SeqT groups, on the performance of the now 19-month-old mice. When compared to SeqT and control groups, DT mice significantly displayed better procedural learning in both VD and RVD tasks as young adults. In the RVD task, this enhanced performance was associated with both poorer inhibition and motor performance. Finally, in 19-month-old mice, both DT and SeqT mice displayed better motor and cognitive performances than control mice. This new cognitive-motor DT paradigm in mice yields an interesting framework that should be useful for adapting DT training in aging, including providing knowledge on the neurobiological correlates, to get the most out of its benefits.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal microglial activation has been suggested as “driven force” promoting brain aging. Lipid droplets accumulating microglia (LDAM), identified as a novel inflammatory phenotype, elevate neuroinflammation and exaggerate neuronal injuries in aging and multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Since chronic HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) (+) individuals show an accelerated brain aging and higher incidence of neurological symptoms compared to age-matched HIV (-) population, we hypothesize that LDAM are also involved in such phenomenon. For validating the hypothesis, we employed HIV transgenic (HIV-Tg) and wilt type (WT) rats to check lipid droplets (LDs) accumulation in the brains at mature (6 months) and middle age (12 months). Our results showed that HIV-Tg rats possess higher levels of LDs formation in the hippocampus (HP) and prefrontal cortex (PFc) than controls at middle age. Increased LDs are mainly presented in microglia in the HP but largely co-localized with astrocytes in the PFc. Interestingly, increased LDs are associated with upregulation on Iba1 but not with GFAP levels. HIV-Tg rats reveal an accelerated LDs accumulation during normal aging. Purified microglia from HIV-Tg rats (12 month) show higher expression of neuroimmune signaling than microglia from controls. HIV-Tg rats showed dysregulation on cholesterol synthesis in the brain HP as well as deficiency on locomotion coordination compared to controls. Overall, our results demonstrate substantial LDs accumulation in the brains of HIV-Tg rats which is associated with abnormal microglial activation and accelerated decline on locomotion coordination during aging. Dysregulation on lipid metabolism might underlie accelerated brain aging in the context of chronic HIV infection.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease with a poor prognosis. To date, more than 40 ALS-related genes have been identified. However, there is still a lack of targeted therapeutic drugs for the treatment of ALS, especially for patients with acute onset and severe disease. A series of studies reported missense heterozygous mutations with loss of function in the coding region of the <i>ANG</i> gene in ALS patients. <i>ANG</i> deficiency is related to the pathogenesis of ALS, but the underlying mechanism has not been determined. This article aimed to synthesize and consolidate the knowledge of the pathological mechanism of ALS induced by <i>ANG</i> mutation and provide a theoretical basis for ALS diagnosis and targeted therapy. This article further delves into the mechanisms underlying the current understanding of the structure and function of the <i>ANG</i> gene, the association between <i>ANG</i> and ALS, and its pathogenesis. Mutations in <i>ANG</i> may lead to the development of ALS through the loss of neuroprotective function, induction of oxidative stress, or inhibition of rRNA synthesis. <i>ANG</i> mutations and genetic and environmental factors may cause disease heterogeneity and more severe disease than in ALS patients with the wild-type gene. Exploring this mechanism is expected to provide a new approach for ALS treatment through increasing <i>ANG</i> expression or angiogenin activity. However, the related study is still in its infancy; therefore, this article also highlights the need for further exploration of the application of <i>ANG</i> gene mutations in clinical trials and animal experiments is needed to achieve improved early diagnosis and treatment of ALS.",

In the prospective observational cohort study Elderly in Linköping Screening Assessment (ELSA 85), 496 individuals in Linköping, Sweden, were followed from age 85 years with cognitive assessments. Blood pressure (BP) was measured supine and after 1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes of standing. Participants with a BP fall of ≥20 mmHg systolic or ≥10 mmHg diastolic after 1 or 3 minutes were classified as classical continuous or classical transient OH depending on whether the BP fall was sustained or not, at subsequent measurements. Those with a BP fall of the same magnitude, but only after 5 or 10 minutes were classified as delayed OH. Of participants, 329 took part in BP measurements and were included. Of these, 156 (47.4%) had classical OH (113 [34.3%] continuous classical, 38 [11.6%] transient classical), and 15 (4.6%) had delayed OH. Cognitive assessments were not markedly different between groups. After 8.6 years, 195 (59.3%) of the participants had died, and delayed vs no OH was associated with twice the risk of all-cause mortality, HR 2.15 (95% CI 1.12-4.12). Transient classical OH was associated with reduced mortality, HR 0.58 (95% CI 0.33-0.99), but not after multiple adjustments, and continuous classical OH was not associated with mortality. OH may have different implications for morbidity and mortality in 85-year-olds compared with younger populations.",

    "abstract": "Osteoporosis is an age-related, systemic skeletal disease that poses a significant public health challenge in contemporary society. Development at the epigenetic level is emerging as an important pathogenic mechanism of osteoporosis. Despite indications of a robust association between DNA methylation and osteoporosis development, a comprehensive understanding of the specific role of DNA methylation in osteoporosis remains limited. In this study, significant bone loss was detected at the beginning of eight weeks of age in mouse models of premature aging (SHJH<i><sup>hr</sup></i> mice). We identified a notable upregulation of DNA methyltransferase 3b/3l (<i>Dnmt3b/l</i>) and downregulation of ten eleven translocation dioxygenase 1 (<i>Tet1</i>) in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) isolated from SHJH<i><sup>hr</sup></i> mice, along with an increase in the overall 5-methylcytosine (5mC) levels. Moreover, methylation capture sequencing revealed genomic hypermethylation in SHJH<i><sup>hr</sup></i> mice BMSCs. Integrated methylome and transcriptome analyses revealed several crucial methylated genes and networks that are potentially associated with osteoporosis development. Notably, elevated methylation levels of genes linked to the Wnt signaling pathway, particularly bone morphogenetic protein 2 (<i>Bmp2</i>) and fibroblast growth factor receptor (<i>Fgfr2</i>), appeared to compromise the osteogenic differentiation potential of BMSCs. Concurrently, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors attenuated the methylation of the promoter regions of <i>Bmp2</i> and <i>Fgfr2</i> and rescued the osteogenic differentiation potential of the BMSCs from SHJH<i><sup>hr</sup></i> mice. In summary, our study provides novel insights into the role of DNA methylation in the development of osteoporosis and suggests promising prospects for employing epigenetic interventions to manage osteoporosis.",

Under physiological conditions, S-nitrosylation plays a dynamic role in a wide range of biological processes by regulating the function of substrate proteins. Like other post-translational modifications, S-nitrosylation can affect protein conformation, activity, localization, aggregation, and protein interactions. Aberrant S-nitrosylation can lead to protein misfolding, mitochondrial fragmentation, synaptic damage, and autophagy. Mitochondria are essential organelles in energy production, metabolite biosynthesis, cell death, and immune responses, among other processes. Mitochondrial dysfunction can result in cell death and has been implicated in the development of many human diseases. Recent evidence suggests that S-nitrosylation and mitochondrial dysfunction are important modulators of the progression of several diseases. In this review, we highlight recent findings regarding the aberrant S- nitrosylation of mitochondrial proteins that regulate mitochondrial biosynthesis, fission and fusion, and autophagy. Specifically, we discuss the mechanisms by which S-nitrosylated mitochondrial proteins exercise mitochondrial quality control under pathological conditions, thereby influencing disease. A better understanding of these pathological events may provide novel therapeutic targets to mitigate the development of neurological diseases.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular aging is a progressive remodeling process constituting a variety of cellular and molecular alterations that are closely linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, gaining a deeper understanding of the changes in mitochondrial function during cardiovascular aging is crucial for preventing cardiovascular diseases. Cardiac aging is accompanied by fibrosis, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, metabolic changes, and infiltration of immune cells, collectively contributing to the overall remodeling of the heart. Similarly, during vascular aging, there is a profound remodeling of blood vessel structure. These remodeling present damage to endothelial cells, increased vascular stiffness, impaired formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis), the development of arteriosclerosis, and chronic vascular inflammation. This review underscores the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiac aging, exploring its impact on fibrosis and myocardial alterations, metabolic remodeling, immune response remodeling, as well as in vascular aging in the heart. Additionally, we emphasize the significance of mitochondria-targeted therapies in preventing cardiovascular diseases in the elderly.",

    "abstract": "Aging is associated with progressive brain atrophy and declines in learning and memory, often attributed to hippocampal or cortical deterioration. The role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in modulating the structural and functional changes in the brain and visual system, particularly in relation to BDNF Val66Met polymorphism, remains underexplored. In this present cross-sectional observational study, we aimed to assess the effects of BDNF polymorphism on brain structural integrity, cognitive function, and visual pathway alterations. A total of 108 older individuals with no evidence of dementia and a mean (SD) age of 67.3 (9.1) years were recruited from the Optic Nerve Decline and Cognitive Change (ONDCC) study cohort. The BDNF Met allele carriage had a significant association with lower entorhinal cortex volume (6.7% lower compared to the Val/Val genotype, P = 0.02) and posterior cingulate volume (3.2% lower than the Val/Val group, P = 0.03), after adjusting for confounding factors including age, sex and estimated total intracranial volumes (eTIV). No significant associations were identified between the BDNF Val66Met genotype and other brain volumetric or diffusion measures, cognitive performances, or vision parameters except for temporal retinal nerve fibre layer thickness. Small but significant correlations were found between visual structural and functional, cognitive, and brain morphological metrics. Our findings suggest that carriage of BDNF Val66Met polymorphism is associated with lower entorhinal cortex and posterior cingulate volumes and may be involved in modulating the cortical morphology along the aging process.",

    "abstract": "The progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) is often accompanied by cognitive decline. We had previously developed a brain age estimation program utilizing structural MRI data of 949 healthy individuals from publicly available sources. Structural MRI data of 244 PD patients who were cognitively normal at baseline was acquired from the Parkinson Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). 192 of these showed stable normal cognitive function from baseline out to 5 years (PD-SNC), and the remaining 52 had unstable normal cognition and developed mild cognitive impairment within 5 years (PD-UNC). 105 healthy controls were also included in the analysis as a reference. First, we examined if there were any baseline differences in regional brain structure between PD-UNC and PD-SNC cohorts utilizing the three most widely used atrophy estimation pipelines, i.e., voxel-based morphometry (VBM), deformation-based morphometry and cortical thickness analyses. We then investigated if accelerated brain age estimation with our multivariate regressive machine learning algorithm was different across these groups (HC, PD-SNC, and PD-UNC). As per the VBM analysis, PD-UNC patients demonstrated a noticeable increase in GM volume in the posterior and anterior lobes of the cerebellum, sub-lobar, extra-nuclear, thalamus, and pulvinar regions when compared to PD-SNC at baseline. PD-UNC patients were observed to have significantly older brain age compared to both PD-SNC patients (p=0.009) and healthy controls (p<0.009). The increase in GM volume in the PD-UNC group could potentially indicate an inflammatory or neuronal hypertrophy response, which could serve as a biomarker for future cognitive decline among this population.",

    "abstract": "Screening for and prevention of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures is imperative, given the high burden on individuals and society. This study constructed and validated an aging-related biomarker derived from the urinary proteomic profile (UPP) indicative of osteoporosis (UPPost-age). In a prospective population study done in northern Belgium (1985-2019), participants were invited for a follow-up examination in 2005-2010 and participants in the 2005-2010 examination again invited in 2009-2013. Participants in both the 2005-2010 and 2009-2013 examinations (n = 519) constituted the derivation (2005-2016 data) and time-shifted validation (2009-2013 data) datasets; 187 participants with only 2005-2010 data formed the synchronous validation dataset. The UPP was assessed by capillary electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry. Analyses focused on 2372 sequenced urinary peptides (101 proteins) with key roles in maintaining the integrity of bone tissue. In multivariable analyses with correction for multiple testing, chronological age was associated with 99 urinary peptides (16 proteins). Peptides derived from IGF2 and MGP were upregulated in women compared to men, whereas COL1A2, COL3A1, COL5A2, COL10A1 and COL18A1 were downregulated. Via application of a 1000-fold bootstrapped elastic regression procedure, finally, 29 peptides (10 proteins) constituted the UPPost-age biomarker, replicated across datasets. In cross-sectional analyses of 2009-2013 data (n = 706), the body-height-to-arm-span ratio, an osteoporosis marker, was negatively associated with UPPost-age (p&;lt0.0001). Over 4.89 years (median), the 10-year risk of osteoporosis associated with chronological age and UPPost-age (53 cases including 37 fractures in 706 individuals) increased by 21% and 36% (p ≤ 0.044). Among 357 women, the corresponding estimates were 55% and 60% for incident osteoporosis (37 cases; p ≤ 0.0003) and 42% and 44% for osteoporotic fractures (25 cases; p ≤ 0.017). In conclusion, an aging-related UPP signature with focus on peptide fragments derived from bone-related proteins is associated with osteoporosis risk and available for clinical and trial research.",

These transferred mitochondria not only carry bioactive molecules but also signal to mitigate risks in both healthy and pathological conditions. In this review, we summarized mitochondrial transfer events, relevant routes, and underlying molecular mechanisms originating from diverse cell populations within NVU. We particularly focus on the therapeutic potential of this mechanism in treating central nervous system disorders, notably neurodegenerative diseases marked by mitochondrial dysfunction and then highlight the promising prospects of exogenous mitochondrial supplementation as a treatment target.",

    "abstract": "Across mammals, lifespans vary remarkably, spanning over a hundredfold difference. Comparative studies consistently reveal a strong inverse relationship between developmental pace and lifespan, hinting at the potential for early-life interventions (ELIs) to influence aging and lifespan trajectories. Focusing on postnatal interventions in mice, this review explores how ELIs influence development, lifespan, and the underlying mechanisms. Previous ELI studies have employed a diverse array of approaches, including dietary modifications, manipulations of the somatotropic axis, and various chemical treatments. Notably, these interventions have demonstrated significant impacts on aging and lifespan in mice. The underlying mechanisms likely involve pathways related to mitochondrial function, mTOR and AMPK signaling, cellular senescence, and epigenetic alterations. Interestingly, ELI studies may serve as valuable models for investigating the complex regulatory mechanisms of development and aging, particularly regarding the interplay among somatic growth, sexual maturation, and lifespan. In addition, prior research has highlighted the intricacies of experimental design and data interpretation. Factors such as timing, sex-specific effects, administration methods, and animal husbandry practices must be carefully considered to ensure the reliability and reproducibility of results, as well as rigorous interpretation. Addressing these factors is essential for advancing our understanding of how development, aging, and lifespan are regulated, potentially opening avenues for interventions that promote healthy aging.",

    "abstract": "Ischemic stroke represents a significant global health challenge, often resulting in death or long-term disability, particularly among the elderly, where advancing age stands as the most unmodifiable risk factor. Arising from the blockage of a brain-feeding artery, the only therapies available to date aim at removing the blood clot to restore cerebral blood flow and rescue neuronal cells from death. The prevailing treatment approach involves thrombolysis by administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), albeit with a critical time constraint. Timely intervention is imperative, given that delayed thrombolysis increases tPA leakage into the brain parenchyma, causing harmful effects. Strategies to preserve tPA's vascular benefits while shielding brain cells from its toxicity have been explored. Notably, administering neuroserpin (Ns), a brain-specific tPA inhibitor, represents one such approach. Following ischemic stroke, Ns levels rise and correlate with favorable post-stroke outcomes. Studies in rodent models of focal cerebral ischemia have demonstrated the beneficial effects of Ns administration. Ns treatment maintains blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, reducing stroke volume. Conversely, Ns-deficient animals exhibit larger stroke injury, increased BBB permeability and enhanced microglia activation. Furthermore, Ns administration extends the therapeutic window for tPA intervention, underscoring its potential in stroke management. Remarkably, our investigation reveals the presence of Ns within extracellular vesicles (EVs), small membrane-surrounded particles released by all cells and critical for intercellular communication. EVs influence disease outcome following stroke through cargo transfer between cells. Clarifying the role of EVs containing NS could open up urgently needed novel therapeutic approaches to improve post-ischemic stroke outcome.",

To identify unmet medication needs and inequality, and the association with health outcomes. A total of 69,443 participants in 31 countries from five international cohorts of aging were included. We measured the unmet medication needs level across sociodemographic strata. We developed an equality-oriented health care service coverage index (ESCI) and explored its relation to all-cause mortality in older adults over 55 years of age. Unmet medication needs in older adults with chronic conditions reached 41.84%. The highest unmet needs were observed in older age groups and participants with multimorbidity. The ESCI was further constructed by covering both the unmet needs level and inequality. An inverse association was observed between the ESCI and all-cause mortality in older adults (β=-16.81, P=0.047) as well as mortality rate owing to noncommunicable diseases (β=-17.58, P=0.041). The ESCI was inversely associated with mortality in older adults. This index could serve as a process evaluation indicator in assessing the progress toward UHC and healthy aging.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease and is characterized by progressive cognitive decline. Pathologically, this disease is associated with the accumulation of extracellular amyloid plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and neuroinflammation. Current drug treatments primarily focus on managing symptoms rather than stopping disease progression. Disease-modifying therapies target the clearance of amyloid plaques through active and passive immunity methods. Although successful in animal models, human trials have shown adverse effects, such as meningoencephalitis, in a small number of patients who received active immunity methods. The efficacy of active immunity methods in treating AD remains uncertain, but passive immunity methods amyloid-beta (Abeta)-specific monoclonal antibody therapies such as aducanumab and lecanemab have been approved by the FDA. Despite the limitations of immune-based therapies, T-cell, and chimeric antigen receptor-based treatments show promise, but new guidelines are necessary to address potential adverse events. Research into the relationship between adaptive immune responses and AD is expected to provide innovative treatment approaches.",

Frailty, a state of vulnerability related to aging, has been recently studied in neurological conditions but has received considerably less attention in neuromuscular disorders. This narrative review aims to describe 1) the common characteristics between Fried's frailty phenotype criteria (muscular weakness, slow gait speed, weight loss, exhaustion/fatigue, and low physical activity) and DM1, and 2) the psychological and social factors potentially contributing to frailty in DM1. This review gathered evidence suggesting that DM1 patients meet four of the five frailty phenotype criteria. Additionally, longitudinal studies report the deterioration of these criteria over time in DM1. Patients also exhibit psychological/cognitive and social factors that might contribute to frailty. Monitoring frailty criteria in the DM1 population could help to implement timely preventions and interventions to reduce the disease burden and severity of frailty symptoms.",

Emerging evidence suggests that poor sleep quality compromises the glymphatic system, a perivascular network crucial for brain waste clearance, leading to the accumulation of neuroinflammatory and toxic proteins, which may affect myelin integrity. Furthermore, poor sleep quality results in alterations in gene expression within the brain. We evaluated the associations among poor sleep quality, brain myelin integrity, and glymphatic clearance function as well as the impact of circadian clock gene expression on regional cortical myelin content. 50 poor sleepers (average age 71.08 ± 4.69 years; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI] &;gt 5) and 50 good sleepers (average age 73.04 ± 5.80 years; PSQI ≤ 5) were assessed. Myelin volume fraction (MVF) was quantified using magnetization transfer saturation imaging, and glymphatic function was noninvasively examined using diffusion tensor imaging along the perivascular space. Circadian gene expression was analyzed using postmortem brain tissue from the Allen Human Brain Atlas. Magnetic resonance imaging measures were correlated with cognitive and depression scores. Lower MVF was observed in the fronto-temporo-parietal and limbic regions as well as in major white matter tracts in poor sleepers compared with that in good sleepers. This reduction was linked to lower cognitive function scores and higher depressive scores. Poor sleepers also exhibited lower diffusivity along the perivascular spaces, mediating the relationship between poor sleep quality and demyelination. Regions with higher expression of CLOCK, CRY2, PER1, and PER2 exhibited greater MVF disparities between good and poor sleepers, whereas lower expression of CRY1 was associated with more pronounced differences. Poor sleep quality was associated with lower brain myelin integrity, correlating with reduced cognitive performance and increased depressive symptoms. These changes might be mediated by glymphatic clearance dysfunction and were associated with the differential expression of circadian clock genes.",

    "abstract": "Plasma biomarkers represent promising tools for the screening and diagnosis of patients with neurodegenerative conditions. However, it is crucial to account for the effects of aging on biomarker profiles, especially in the oldest segments of the population. Additionally, biomarkers in this sample can offer in vivo insights into the physiological mechanisms underlying brain aging while concomitantly supporting cognitive preservation. In this study we analyzed plasma Alzheimer's disease (AD) core biomarkers, neurofilament light chain (NfL), and glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) using the Single Molecule Array (SIMOA) platform in 75 cognitively preserved nonagenarians, and compared with baseline samples of 153 volunteers who were cognitively unimpaired (CU) during six years (classified in ≤ 70, and 71 to 85 years of age), and with 108 AD patients. Nonagenarians almost lack the APOEε4 allele, and had significantly higher Aß40, Aß42, p-tau181, NfL, and GFAP, along with a significantly lower Aß42/40 ratio (P&;lt0.001) compared with the two CU groups. NfL and GFAP tripled concentrations in nonagenarians. No differences were noted in any plasma biomarker between the younger and older CU groups. Biomarkers correlated strongly with age only when analyzing together CU controls and nonagenarians. Compared with AD cases, nonagenarians showed lower p-tau181 (P=0.001), higher total tau (P=0.02), and much higher Aß40, Aß42 and NfL levels (P&;lt0.001). The levels of GFAP in nonagenarians were similar to those observed in AD patients. In conclusion, cognitively preserved nonagenarians do not develop the AD biomarker signature and exhibit higher levels of Aß42. However, their threefold increase in NfL and GFAP supports their aging brains are somehow resilient to neurodegeneration. These data support caution in the prognosis of clinical dementia based on NfL and GFAP values. Overall, plasma biomarkers in CU individuals remained quite stable till the eighties.",

Upon detecting stress signals, cells activate a transcriptional response termed the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt). This response is crucial for maintaining protein homeostasis, facilitating mitochondrial function recovery, promoting cell survival, and ultimately influencing lifespan. Striated muscles play a pivotal role in oxygen supply, movement, and metabolism. The aging of these muscles can lead to heart failure, arrhythmias, and sarcopenia, significantly impacting quality of life and lifespan. Given the intimate connection between UPRmt and striated muscle aging, UPRmt emerges as a potential therapeutic target for mitigating the effects of striated muscle aging. In this review, we delve into the role of UPRmt in striated muscle aging, drawing upon the extant molecular regulatory mechanisms of UPRmt. This exploration may enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of striated muscle aging and aid in the identification of potential drug targets.",

The pathogenesis of AD is complex, and there are several hypotheses, primarily including the Aβ cascade hypothesis, the neurofibrillary tangle hypothesis, the inflammatory hypothesis, and the cholinergic hypothesis. It has been suggested that the dysregulation of multiple energy metabolic pathways, especially mitochondria metabolism, may be related to the severity of AD pathology and disease symptoms in the brain. The modification of histone (lysine) methylation, an actively regulated and reversible process, is closely related to energy metabolism and plays a crucial role in AD development. In summary, histone methylation, energy metabolism, and AD restricted and regulated each other. Here, we review the advances in the correlation between histone methylation, energy metabolism, and AD.

    "abstract": "Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of programmed cell death driven by oxidative stress, plays a crucial role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aging diminishes antioxidant systems that maintain iron homeostasis, particularly affecting the glutathione peroxidase (GPX) system, leading to increased ferroptosis and exacerbated neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in AD. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a key transcription factor regulating genes involved in antioxidant defense and ferroptosis. In this review, we examine the interconnected roles of Nrf2 signaling, iron metabolism, and ferroptosis in AD, and discuss how regular physical exercise-known to enhance antioxidant capacity-might influence these processes. Despite evidence linking exercise to improved cognitive function in AD and its role in modulating oxidative stress, there is a paucity of research specifically addressing how exercise affects ferroptosis in the AD brain. To address this gap, we utilized bioinformatics techniques to identify potential pathways and mechanisms by which exercise may mitigate ferroptosis in AD through Nrf2 signaling. Analyzing gene expression profiles from the GEO database, we identified differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes in the hippocampus following exercise intervention. Hub genes like SLC2A1, TXN, MEF2C, and KRAS were significantly upregulated, suggesting that exercise may activate a network enhancing antioxidant defenses and regulating iron metabolism via Nrf2. Our findings propose a novel mechanism whereby exercise alleviates abnormal ferroptosis in the AD brain through modulation of Nrf2 signaling. This study highlights the need for further research to validate these findings and explore exercise as a therapeutic strategy for AD by targeting ferroptosis.",

    "abstract": "The role of endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids; eCBs) in cognitive-related processes has been demonstrated in preclinical studies. However, observational studies are lacking. We examined the associations of multiple circulating eCBs and eCB-like molecules with cognitive function in a sample of dementia-free older adults. In this exploratory, cross-sectional study, serum levels of 44 eCBs were analyzed in 237 older participants of the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort who attended examination cycle 9 (2011-2014). Linear regression models were used to examine the associations of eCB levels with cognitive function while adjusting for potential confounders and correcting for multiple testing. Effect modification by sex and apolipoprotein ε4 (ApoEε4) was additionally examined. Participants' mean age was 73.3±6.2y and 40% were men. After correction for multiple comparisons, increased levels of linoleic acid, linolenic acid, oleic acid, oleoyl alanine and palmitoyl alanine were associated with poorer executive function (B±SE=-0.0002±0.0001, p=0.002; B±SE=-0.0005±0.0001, p<0.001; B±SE=-0.0002±0.0001, p=0.003; B±SE=-0.74±0.25, p=0.003 and B±SE=-1.75±0.62, p=0.005, respectively). In addition, elevated levels of linolenoyl amide and linoleoyl amide were associated with poorer verbal memory (B±SE=-1.45±0.44, p=0.001 and B±SE=-0.16±0.05, p<0.001, respectively) and attention (B±SE=-0.12±0.04, p<0.001 and B±SE=-0.013±0.004, p<0.001, respectively). A significant interaction with sex was observed such that most of the above associations were present only among women. Furthermore, associations between several eCBs and perceptual organization were observed only among participants with ApoEε4 genotype. We identified novel eCB compounds that may be related to cognitive function. Validation of these findings is warranted and should consider sex and ApoEε4 interactions.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing pressure for researchers to reduce their reliance on animals, particularly in early-stage research. The main reason for that change arises from the different biological behavior of humans that leads to frequent failure of translating data from bench to bed. The advent of organoid technology ten years ago, along with the feasibility of obtaining brain organoids in most laboratories, has created considerable expectations not exempting frustration. In this review, we make a critical appraisal of the advantages and limitations of studying Alzheimer's disease in brain cortical organoids derived from inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). While dealing with human neurons and glia in 3D poses a tremendous advantage versus murine brain cells, organoids typically lack microglia, blood vessels, immune interactions as well as proper CNS neuropil. In turn, they have relatively few oligodendrocytes and low myelination. In addition, lengthy procedures to get proper mature organoids constitute an additional limitation that may also affect the native biological properties of neurons and glia. We conclude that human brain organoids, while popular and useful, remain a model that needs further refinement before bringing substantial value to study Alzheimer's disease.",

It neglects the earliest, non-cognitive, and multifaceted symptoms of gradually accumulating cerebral damage. Subtle personality changes, balance problems, muscle wasting, weight loss, changing sleep patterns and declining blood pressure and cholesterol, precede memory problems and cognitive impairment. Chronic cerebral deterioration offers a new comprehensive concept, capturing symptoms across late-life cerebral dysfunction domains, and revising alleged dementia 'risk factors' more realistically into prodromal signs of cerebral deterioration. This may reduce research waste on dementia prevention unsuccessfully targeting prodromes and help identify people at the highest risk of developing care needs. It will improve counselling of older people with signs and symptoms when memory or other cognitive impairments are not yet present. Emphasizing total cerebral function over cognition alone focuses on what is clinically most relevant: the patient's need of care.",

    "abstract": "Hydrocephalus is a prevalent neurological disorder, particularly impactful in older adults, characterized by high incidence and numerous complications that impose a significant burden on healthcare systems. This review aims to provide a comprehensive description of hydrocephalus pathogenesis, focusing on cellular and molecular insights derived from animal models. We also present the latest advances in hydrocephalus research and highlight potential therapeutic targets. Lastly, the review advocates the integration of findings from both animal and human studies to achieve better outcomes and examines the potential of emerging technologies. We wish to raise public attention about this disease in an aging society. Current animal models for hydrocephalus involve acquired hydrocephalus models and genetic/congenital hydrocephalus models. Studies from animals have shown that the main mechanisms of models can be broadly classified into nine types. A variety of drug-targeted therapy methods and non-surgical treatment methods have been used in clinical practice. But current treatment approaches primarily focus on symptomatic relief and intracranial pressure control rather than addressing the underlying pathological mechanisms. We call for the development of more accurate and representative animal models to achieve better outcomes and examine the potential of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and neuroimaging. In summary, this review synthesizes recent findings in hydrocephalus research, identifies promising therapeutic targets and interventions, and critically evaluates the limitations of current research paradigms, aiming to align preclinical studies with clinical endpoints. Continued studies and multidisciplinary collaboration are essential to develop effective interventions and facilitate new treatments into bedside.",

    "abstract": "Reactive astrogliosis has been indicated as one of the earliest pathological biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathology. We previously reported that upregulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) protein in reactive astrocytes contributes to neuroinflammation and cognitive function deficits in murine models of ischemic stroke and vascular stenosis. In this study, we utilized AD human post-mortem and APP/PS1dE9 (APP) transgenic mouse brain tissues to determine whether NHE1 upregulation in astrocytes is associated with AD pathogenesis. In both AD human and APP mouse brain tissues, a significant elevation of NHE1 protein expression was detected in glial fibrillary acidic protein expressing (GFAP+) reactive astrocytes in cortical and hippocampal regions, compared to control groups. Furthermore, increased astrocytic NHE1 protein and GFAP protein were detected in proximity to amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques in APP mouse brains. We then tested the efficacy of pharmacological NHE1 inhibition using its inhibitor, HOE642, in attenuating pathogenesis in APP mice. Vehicle-treated APP mice (APP.Veh) exhibited hyperactive locomotor behavior at 4-months and 7-months of age, compared to wild-type littermates (WT.Veh). In contrast, APP mice-treated with HOE642 (APP.HOE) displayed significantly lower hyperactive locomotor behavior (p&;lt0.01). Additionally, APP.HOE mice showed decreased density of amyloid fibrils. In summary, we detected NHE1 protein upregulation in reactive astrocytes in both AD human and APP brains. Pharmacological inhibition of NHE1 protein attenuated pathological Aβ plaque density, and hyperactive locomotor behaviors in APP mice, highlighting NHE1 as a possible therapeutic target for AD.",

    "abstract": "The association between socioeconomic position (SEP) and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is well established, but its role in driving multimorbidity remains unclear. Multimorbidity, defined as the co-occurrence of more than one chronic condition, is linked to higher mortality and reduced quality of life. This study investigates the association between SEP and multimorbidity using data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). Incident cases of cancer, type 2 diabetes (T2D), and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) were analysed alongside lifestyle factors such as smoking status, alcohol intake, body mass index (BMI), physical activity and diet. Multimorbidity was defined as the presence of at least two of the studied NCDs. SEP was assessed using the Relative Index of Inequality (RII) and categorized into high, medium, and low SEP. The cohort included 277 302 participants (60.7% women) from seven countries, enrolled between 1992-2000 and followed until the first diagnosis, end of follow-up (31/12/2007), or death. For transitions to multimorbidity, follow-up extended from the first diagnosis to the second diagnosis, end of follow-up, or death. Multistate models were used to examine the nine possible transitions to first diagnoses and multimorbidity combinations. Lifestyle factors were risk factors for all the transitions, except alcohol intake. In the main model, not stratified by sex, low SEP was associated with higher risks of progressing from cancer to CVD (Hazard Ratio (HR): 1.23, CI: 1.02-1.50), CVD to T2D (HR: 1.35, CI: 1.07-1.71), and cancer to T2D (HR: 1.37, CI: 1.10-1.69). These findings highlight the persistent influence of social inequalities on the risk of multimorbidity, even in individuals with an existing chronic condition.",

    "abstract": "Aging leads to a decline in physiological functions and increased risk of mortality, yet therapeutic avenues are limited. Dietary phytochemicals provide an attractive approach to counteract age-related health decline. Here, we have examined the impact of feeding extracts of rosemary and ginger, prepared via three different extraction methods, on markers of aging and healthspan in the fruit fly Drosophila. We observed that certain, but not all, extracts of ginger produce modest prolongevity effects. Feeding extracts of rosemary, produced via the three different methods, each produced prolongevity effects. We observe that feeding combinations of both rosemary and ginger extracts leads to robust lifespan extension. We find that the prolongevity effects of rosemary and ginger extracts are linked to improved intestinal barrier function in aged flies. Importantly, we show that the anti-aging effects observed are not linked to reduced food intake. Interestingly, we observe several instances where the combination of rosemary plus ginger produces effects which are more pronounced or not seen for either extract alone. In terms of cellular hallmarks of aging, rosemary plus ginger feeding leads to AMPK activation and improved markers of autophagy and proteostasis in aged flies. Furthermore, feeding the combination of rosemary plus ginger feeding improves cognitive function in aged flies. Our results demonstrate that rosemary and ginger extracts can counteract aging and prolong healthspan in flies.",

As an individual age, a phenomenon known as immunosenescence occurs. Immunosenescence is characterized by the deterioration of immune cells and organs. This decline leads to immune dysfunction, which is closely associated with an increased mortality rate among elderly sepsis patients. Recent studies have revealed that various responses during sepsis can induce premature aging of immune organs and cells in younger individuals, a process referred to as premature immunosenescence, which further accelerates the progression of sepsis and contributes to adverse outcomes. There is a significant correlation between immunosenescence and sepsis; therefore, understanding the specific manifestations and underlying mechanisms of immunosenescence induced by sepsis is imperative. Additionally, treatment strategies aimed at reversing or alleviating both immune aging and immune suppression in septic patients are worthwhile exploring and will also improve understanding of the concept of immunosenescence.",

    "abstract": "Rita Levi-Montalcini's 1953 discovery of nerve growth factor (NGF) in mouse sarcoma tumors marked a groundbreaking moment in neuroscience. NGF, a key signaling molecule, became the first identified neurotrophic factor, influencing the growth, differentiation, and survival of neurons in both peripheral and central nervous systems. NGF and related neurotrophic factors hold therapeutic potential for various neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal cord injuries, neuropathies, traumatic brain injuries, and stroke. However, despite promising in vitro studies and animal models findings, NGF efficacy in patients remains unproven. Indeed, its use as a therapeutic agent faces challenges in delivery and clinical translation. This review delves into these challenges, exploring ongoing research on refined delivery methods, dosages, and safety profiles. Innovative strategies, including molecular mimicking, combination therapies, gene therapy, and coupling with neuromodulation techniques like transcranial magnetic stimulation and vagal nerve stimulation, are discussed. Incorporating nerve growth factor (NGF) into a comprehensive strategy may prove beneficial, particularly in non-neurodegenerative conditions such as stroke, trauma, and neuropathies. In these instances, NGF holds promise for promoting tissue regeneration and repair. Challenges persist in addressing the complexity of neurodegenerative pathologies for a combined therapeutic approach.",

    "abstract": "Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability and the second leading cause of death globally. Approximately 795,000 strokes are reported each year in the US, 87 percent of which are ischemic. [1] The direct medical cost associated with stroke in 2009 was approximately $22.8 billion, with an additional $13.8 billion in indirect costs associated with lost productivity, unemployment, rehabilitation, and follow-up care [1]. The incidence of stroke is expected to increase dramatically over the next decade primarily because of an increase in the elderly population and increased incidence of stroke among the middle-aged population. We must develop and implement improved acute and long-term care options to mitigate the increasing burden of stroke.\r\n\r\nThis special edition was designed to address innovative areas of stroke research that are expected to have a tremendous impact on current and future clinical care of stroke patients. Historically, ischemic stroke has been studied and treated as a disease of the cerebrovascular system. However, there is a well-characterized and understudied immunological response to ischemic stroke that provides an opportunity for targeting novel therapeutic and rehabilitation strategies. In the opening articles, Doll et al. and Famakin describe the innate and adaptive immune response to stroke and suggests the time window for targeting the immune response to stroke may be longer than previously expected. Studies are needed to follow stroke patients over the course of their injury and recovery to identify time specific patterns of cytokine responses and potential avenues for anti-inflammatory treatment beyond the acute care period. In the third article by Schulze et al, we are reminded of the significant contribution the catecholamine and steroid responses have on guiding the immune response to stroke recovery. Petrone et al. also describes the effects of estrogen on the immune response and how this modulation of the immune response may account for sex differences in ischemic stroke incidence and severity. Continued study in this area will not only be important for stroke, but also other types of brain injuries (traumatic, blast, neurodegenerative) that inevitably alter the hormonal balance and subsequently have immunological consequences.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to consider whether a common mechanism of immune dysfunction underlies many complex diseases, such as stroke, heart disease, myocardial infarction, and atherosclerosis. While it is possible that the immune system is similarly altered, gene-environment interactions may control the timing or severity of the dysfunction, and epigenetic modifications may provide a common molecular mechanism to link the immune response among different disease states. In their review, Saban et al. propose a new theoretical model to guide ischemic stroke research to further understand the extent to which epigenetic signatures bridge the psycho-social environment. Our knowledge of the epigenetic control of the immunological consequences of ischemic stroke is limited and requires a new approach to clinical and pre-clinical studies. The question remains whether we can truly model the human condition of ischemic stroke. Given the advances in genomic technology, systems modeling, and biomedical engineering we must re-invent stroke research and begin to utilize human patients as the best model to study the condition. Thus, new collaborations between scientists, clinicians, engineers and patients will be the key to future success.\r\n\r\nWe hope this special edition broadens your horizons to the possibility of ischemic stroke being an immunological disease. Before we can begin to make significant improvements in clinical care of stroke, we must strengthen our research collaborations and be creative in our approach. Our patients depend on it.",

Thus, we investigated the effects of <i>p66Shc<sup>-/-</sup></i> on the aging of the lung and pulmonary circulation. <i>In vivo</i> lung and cardiac characteristics were investigated in <i>p66Shc<sup>-/-</sup></i> and wild type (WT) mice at 3, 12, and 24 months of age by lung function measurements, micro-computed tomography (µCT), and echocardiography.

Protein and mRNA levels of senescent markers were measured by western blot and PCR, respectively. Lung function declined similarly in WT and <i>p66Shc<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice during aging. However, µCT analyses and stereology showed slightly enhanced signs of aging-related parameters in <i>p66Shc<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice, such as a decline of alveolar density. Accordingly, <i>p66Shc<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice showed higher protein expression of the senescence marker p21 in lung homogenate compared to WT mice of the corresponding age. Pulmonary vascular remodeling was increased during aging, but aged <i>p66Shc<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice showed similar muscularization of pulmonary vessels and hemodynamics like WT mice. In the heart, <i>p66Shc<sup>-/-</sup></i> prevented the deterioration of right ventricular (RV) function but promoted the decline of left ventricular (LV) function during aging. <i>p66Shc<sup>-/-</sup></i> affects the aging process of the lung and the heart differently. While <i>p66Shc<sup>-/-</sup></i> slightly accelerates lung aging and deteriorates LV function in aged mice, it seems to exert protective effects on RV function during aging.",

The main purpose of our study was to assess relationships between MetS and the presence of the <i>FTO</i> rs9939609, the <i>MC4R</i> rs17782313, and the <i>PPAR-γ</i> rs1801282 polymorphisms in 45-60-year-old women. The study included patients from the general population of the Westpomeranian Province (Poland). The mean age was 54.3 ± 4.2 years. The research procedure involved taking structured history, physical examination, anthropometric measurements, and collecting blood for biochemical and genetic analysis. The patients who met the diagnostic criteria for MetS constituted 38.35% of all participants (sample size: 425 patients). The comparison of blood biochemical parameters revealed numerous differences between the women with MetS and those from the control group. Genetic analysis demonstrated that the T allele of the <i>FTO</i> gene was a factor substantially decreasing the incidence of MetS in the study sample (ORT vs. A = 0.734; 95% CI: 0.555 - 0.970; p < 0.05). Other polymorphisms were not directly related to MetS incidence. Conclusions: 1. MetS-related abnormalities are widespread in the population of 45-60-year-old Polish women. Those most common are the elevated serum total cholesterol and LDL levels, increased insulin resistance and BMI scores, as well as visceral obesity. 2. No direct relationships were demonstrated between MetS and the gene polymorphisms analyzed in our study except for the <i>FTO</i> rs9939609, whose A allele and A/A genotype seemed to predispose to metabolic disorders.",

    "abstract": "The perirhinal cortex (PRh) is a critical mediator of recognition memory, and a wealth of evidence points to impairment in PRh function with age. Despite this evidence, age-related deficits in recognition memory are not consistently observed. This may be partially due to the fact that older animals also have well-established deficits in hippocampal function, and many protocols that assess perirhinal function are also sensitive to hippocampal damage. When using one of these protocols, spontaneous object recognition in an open field, we are able to replicate published age-related deficits using pairs of complex objects. However, when using zero-delay object recognition, a task that is more resistant to the influence of changes in hippocampal function, we find no significant age-related differences in recognition memory in the same animals. These data highlight the importance of the protocol used for testing recognition memory, and may place constraints on the role of the PRh in age-related recognition memory impairment as it is typically tested in much of the literature.",

However, little research has investigated the expression of TPM2 in human atherosclerosis samples. A total of 34 clinical samples were obtained, including 17 atherosclerosis and 17 normal artery samples, between January 2018 and April 2021. Bioinformatics analysis was applied to explore the potential role of TPM2 in atherosclerosis. Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and western blotting assays were used to detect the expression of TPM2 and α-SMA proteins. The mRNA expression levels of TPM2 and α-SMA were detected using RT-qPCR. A neural network and intima-media thickness model were constructed. A strong relationship existed between the intima-media thickness and relative protein expression of TPM2 (P<0.001, R=-0.579). The expression of TPM2 was lower in atherosclerosis than normal artery (P<0.05). Univariate logistic regression showed that TPM2 (OR=0.150, 95% CI: 0.026-0.868, P=0.034) had clear correlations with atherosclerosis. A neural network model was successfully constructed with a relativity of 0.94434. TPM2 might be an independent protective factor for arteries, and one novel biomarker of atherosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by inactivating mutations in TSC1 or TSC2.Patients with TSC often require organ transplantation after organ failure. TSC1 serves as an important control node in immune cell development and responses; however, its effect on T cells in transplant immunity has not yet been explored. Here, we characterized the effect of TSC1 deficiency in T cells on acute allograft rejection using a mouse cardiac transplantation model. We observed compromised allograft survival in mice with TSC1-deficient T cells. Notably, the allografts in mice transferred with TSC1-deficient CD8+T cells showed accelerated acute allograft rejection. TSC1 deficiency triggered the increased accumulation of CD8+ T cells in allografts due to augmented infiltration caused by increased CXCR3 expression levels and elevated in-situ proliferation of TSC1-deficient CD8+ T cells. Compared to CD8+ T cells from wild-type (WT) mice, TSC1-deficient CD8+ T cells exhibited enhanced cell proliferation and increased expression levels of interferon-γ and granzyme B after alloantigen stimulation. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), is used to treat patients with TSC and prevent rejection after solid-organ transplantation. Although rapamycin induced most cardiac allografts to survive beyond 100 d in WT mice, rapamycin-treated cardiac allografts in TSC1-deficient mice were rejected within 60 d. These results suggest that TSC1-deficient recipients may be more resistant to rapamycin-mediated immunosuppression during organ transplantation. Collectively, TSC1 significantly accelerates acute allograft rejection by enhancing the alloreactivity of CD8+ T cells, making them more resistant to mTOR inhibitor-mediated immunosuppression.",

    "abstract": "It is unclear how medication use evolved before diagnosis of dementia (DoD). This study aims to identify varied patterns of polypharmacy before DoD, their prevalence and possible complications. We collected primary care e-health records for 33,451 dementia patients in Wales from 1990 to 2015. The medication uses in every 5-year period along with 20-years prior to dementia diagnosis were considered. Exploratory factor analysis was used to identify clusters of medicines for every 5-year period. The prevalence of patients taking three or more medications was 82.16%, 69.7%, 41.1% and 5.5% in the Period 1 (0-5 years before DoD) ~ Period 4 (16-20 years before DoD) respectively. The Period 1 showed 3 clusters of polypharmacy - medicines for respiratory/urinary infections, arthropathies and rheumatism, and cardio-vascular disease (CVD) (66.55%); medicines for infections, arthropathies and rheumatism (AR), cardio-metabolic disease (CMD) and depression (22.02%); and medicines for arthropathies, rheumatism and osteoarthritis (2.6%). The Period 2 showed 4 clusters of polypharmacy - medicines for infections, arthropathies, and CVD (69.7%); medicines for CVD and depression (3%); medicines for CMD and arthropathies (0.3%); and medicines for AR, and CVD (2,5%). The Period 3 showed 6 clusters of polypharmacy - medicines for infections, arthropathies, and CVD (41.1%); medicines for CVD, acute-respiratory-infection (ARI), and arthropathies (1.25%); medicines for AR (1.16%); medicines for depression, anxiety (0.06%); medicines for CMD (1.4%); and medicines for dermatologic disorders (0.9%). The Period 4 showed 3 main clusters of polypharmacy - medicines for infections, arthropathy, and CVD (5.5%); medicines for anxiety, ARI (2.4%); and medicines for ARI and CVD (2.1%). As the development towards dementia progressed, the associative diseases tended to cluster with a larger prevalence in each cluster. Farther away before DoD, the clusters of polypharmacy tended to be clearly distinct between each other, resulting in an increasing number of patterns, but in a smaller prevalence.",

    "abstract": "Lipofuscin (LF) accumulates during lifetime in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and is thought to play a crucial role in intermediate and late age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In an attemt to simulate aged retina and to study response of retinal microglia and RPE cells to LF, we injected a suspension of LF into the subretinal space of adult mice. LF suspension was obtained from human donor eyes. Subretinal injection of PBS or sham injection served as a control. Eyes were inspected by autofluorescence and optical coherence tomography, by electroretinography and on histological and ultrastructural levels. Levels of cytokine mRNA were determined by quantitative PCR separately in the RPE/choroid complex and in the retina. After injection of LF, microglial cells migrated quickly into the subretinal space to close proximity to RPE cells and phagocytosed LF particles. Retinal function was affected only slightly by LF within the first two weeks. After longer time, RPE cells showed clear signs of melanin loss and degradation. Levels of mRNA of inflammatory cytokines increased sharply after injection of both PBS and LF and were higher in the RPE/choroid complex than in the retina and were slightly higher after LF injection. In conclusion, subretinal injection of LF causes an activation of microglial cells and their migration into subretinal space, enhanced expression of inflammatory cytokines and a gradual degradation of RPE cells. These features are found also in an aging retina, and subretinal injection of LF could be a model for intermediate and late AMD.",

    "abstract": "Ionizing irradiation (IR) causes bone marrow (BM) injury, with senescence and impaired self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and inhibiting Wnt signaling could enhance hematopoietic regeneration and survival against IR stress. However, the underlying mechanisms by which a Wnt signaling blockade modulates IR-mediated damage of BM HSCs and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are not yet completely understood. We investigated the effects of osteoblastic Wntless (Wls) depletion on total body irradiation (TBI, 5 Gy)-induced impairments in hematopoietic development, MSC function, and the BM microenvironment using conditional Wls knockout mutant mice (Col-Cre;Wlsfl/fl) and their littermate controls (Wlsfl/fl). Osteoblastic Wls ablation itself did not dysregulate BM frequency or hematopoietic development at a young age. Exposure to TBI at 4 weeks of age induced severe oxidative stress and senescence in the BM HSCs of Wlsfl/fl mice but not in those of the Col-Cre;Wlsfl/fl mice. TBI-exposed Wlsfl/fl mice exhibited greater impairments in hematopoietic development, colony formation, and long-term repopulation than TBI-exposed Col-Cre;Wlsfl/fl mice. Transplantation with BM HSCs or whole BM cells derived from the mutant, but not Wlsfl/fl mice, protected against HSC senescence and hematopoietic skewing toward myeloid cells and enhanced survival in recipients of lethal TBI (10 Gy). Unlike the Wlsfl/fl mice, the Col-Cre;Wlsfl/fl mice also showed radioprotection against TBI-mediated MSC senescence, bone mass loss, and delayed body growth. Our results indicate that osteoblastic Wls ablation renders BM-conserved stem cells resistant to TBI-mediated oxidative injuries. Overall, our findings show that inhibiting osteoblastic Wnt signaling promotes hematopoietic radioprotection and regeneration.",

However, whether the <i>REST</i> rs3796529 genotype is associated with the rate of functional deterioration in AD is unknown. A total of 584 blood samples from Taiwanese patients with AD were collected from January 2002 to December 2013. The diagnosis of AD was based on the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria. The allele frequency of rs3796529-T was compared between the AD cohort and 993 individuals from the general population in Taiwan. Kaplan-Meier analysis, the log rank test and a multivariate Cox model were then used to evaluate the association between rs3796529-T and functional deterioration in the AD cohort. The allele frequency of rs3796529-T was significantly lower in the AD cohort compared to the general population cohort (36.82% vs. 40.73%, p=0.029). Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log rank test showed that the AD patients carrying the rs3796529 T/T genotype had a longer progression-free survival than those with the C/C genotype (p=0.012). In multivariate analysis, the rs3796529 T/T genotype (adjusted HR=0.593, 95% CI: 0.401-0.877, p=0.009) was an independent protective factor for functional deterioration. The rs3796529 T/T genotype was associated with slower functional deterioration in patients with AD. This finding may lead to a to better understanding of the molecular pathways involved, and prompt further development of novel biomarkers to monitor AD.",

The proliferative capacity of hepatocytes was restored with the senescence reversal.

Here, we found that senescent hepatocytes from aged liver were rejuvenated after exposing to young blood. An autonomous proliferation of senescent hepatocytes which resulting in ploidy reversal might be the underlying mechanism of senescent reversal. After performing 2/3 partial hepatectomy (2/3PHx) in young blood exposed old liver, delayed DNA synthesis of senescent hepatocytes was rescued and the number of BrdU positive hepatocytes was restored from 4.39±2.30% to 17.85±3.21%, similarly to that in the young mice at 36 hours post 2/3PHx. Moreover, Cyclin A2 and Cyclin E1 overexpression of hepatocytes in aged liver facilitating the G1/S phase transition was contributed to enhance liver regeneration. Furthermore, lipid droplet spread widely in the elderly human liver and old mouse liver, but this aged-associated liver steatosis was alleviated as senescence reversal.

In this study, we showed that Tip110 was present in the 7SK snRNP through direct binding to MEPCE, a component of the 7SK snRNP complex. In addition, we found a positive association between Tip110 expression, change of HEXIM1 from dimer/oligomer to monomer, and release of HEXIM1 and P-TEFb from the 7SK snRNP complex. A similar association was also noted specifically in nuclear matrix as well as in chromatin where the free HEXIM1 and 7SK snRNP-bound HEXIM1 are located. Moreover, we demonstrated that Tip110 expression was linked to the glutathione metabolic pathway and the intracellular redox level, which in turn regulated HEXIM1 dimerization/oligomerization. Lastly, we performed the FRET microscopic analysis and confirmed the direct relationship between Tip110 expression and HEXIM1 dimerization/oligomerization in vivo. Taken together, these results identified a new mechanism governing HEXIM1 dimerization/oligomerization and the release of HEXIM1 and P-TEFb from the 7SK snRNP complex. These results also yield new insights to the roles of Tip110 in HIV gene transcription and replication.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) and gastrointestinal (GI) cancers are both \"age-related diseases\" sharing several environmental risk factors, but possess opposite underlying biological mechanisms. Aim of this study was to evaluate the correlations between GI cancers and PD using national cause-specific mortality data of 183 countries extracted from the Global Health Observatory database. The association between PD- and GI cancers- (i.e. esophagus cancer, EC; stomach cancer, SC; colorectal cancer, CRC; liver cancer, LC and pancreatic cancer, PC) specific mortality on the country level was evaluated using Spearman correlation and logistic regression analysis. A global increase in mortality from 2000 to 2019 was observed in PD, CRC and PC, whereas in EC, SC and LC it decreased. We see the consistent diminishment of correlation intensities between PD and GI cancer mortalities from 2000 to 2019 as a positive development. In 2019, PD inversely correlated with CRC (rs = -0.39) and PC (rs = -0.40, all P < 0.001) but not with EC and SC. Of note, an exceptionally positive correlation of PD with LC (rs = 0.26, P < 0.001) and its two hepatitis B and C virus-associated subtypes was revealed. Logistic regression analysis further determined that PD associated negatively with CRC (OR = 0.25) and PC (OR = 0.21, both P < 0.001), but positively with LC (OR = 2.27, P = 0.007). Consequently, future research aiming to unravel the functional biological link between neurodegeneration, hepatitis and tumor development holds great potential for developing novel therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Age-associated low bone mass disease is a growing problem in the US. Development of osteoanabolic therapies for treating skeletal fragility has lagged behind anti-catabolic therapies, but several bone-building molecules are clinically available. We reported previously that antibody-based neutralization of the Lrp5/Lrp6 inhibitor Dkk1 has minimal effects on bone gain, but can potentiate the already potent osteoanabolic effects of sclerostin inhibition (another Lrp5/Lrp6 inhibitor highly expressed by osteocytes). In this communication, we test whether an optimized ratio of sclerostin and Dkk1 antibodies (Scl-mAb and Dkk1-mAb, respectively), administered at low doses, can maintain the same bone-building effects as higher dose Scl-mAb, in adult (6 months of age) and aged (20 months of age) wild-type mice. A 3:1 dose of Scl-mAb:Dkk1-mAb at 12.5 mg/kg was equally efficacious as 25 mg/kg of Scl-mAb in both age groups, using radiographic (DXA, µCT), biomechanical, (3-point bending tests), and histological (fluorochrome-based bone formation parameters) outcome measures. For some bone properties, including trabecular thickness and bone mineral density in the spine, and endocortical bone formation rates in the femur, the 3:1 treatment was associated with significantly improved skeletal properties compared to twice the dose of Scl-mAb. Cortical porosity in aged mice was also reduced by both Scl-mAb and low-dose 3:1 treatment. Overall, both treatments were efficacious in the mature adult (6 mo.) and aged (20 mo.) skeletons, suggesting Wnt targeting is a viable strategy for improving skeletal fragility in the very old. Further, the data suggest that low dose of combination therapy can be at least equally efficacious as higher doses of Scl-mAb monotherapy.",

We examined the link between the WM connectome and obesity and AD through edge-density imaging/index (EDI), a tractography-based method that characterizes the anatomical embedding of tractography connections. A total of 60 participants, 30 known to convert from normal cognition or mild-cognitive impairment to AD within a minimum of 24 months of follow up, were selected from the Alzheimer disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Diffusion-weighted MR images from the baseline scans were used to extract fractional anisotropy (FA) and EDI maps that were subsequently averaged using deterministic WM tractography based on the Desikan-Killiany atlas. Multiple linear and logistic regression analysis were used to identify the weighted sum of tract-specific FA or EDI indices that maximized correlation to body-mass-index (BMI) or conversion to AD. Participants from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) were used as an independent validation for the BMI findings. The edge-density rich, periventricular, commissural and projection fibers were among the most important WM tracts linking BMI to FA as well as to EDI. WM fibers that contributed significantly to the regression model related to BMI overlapped with those that predicted conversion; specifically in the frontopontine, corticostriatal, and optic radiation pathways. These results were replicated by testing the tract-specific coefficients found using ADNI in the OASIS-4 dataset. WM mapping with EDI enables identification of an abnormal connectome implicated in both obesity and conversion to AD.",

    "abstract": "Catheter ablation is a well-established rhythm control therapy in atrial fibrillation (AF). Although the prevalence of AF increases dramatically with age, the prognosis and safety profile of index and repeat ablation procedures remain unclear in the older population. The primary endpoint of this study was to assess the arrhythmia recurrence, reablation and complication rates in older patients. Secondary endpoints were the identification of independent predictors of arrhythmia recurrence and reablation, including information on pulmonary vein (PV) reconnection and other atrial foci. Older (n=129, ≥70 years) and younger (n=129, <70 years) patients were compared using a propensity-score matching analysis based on age, gender, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, dilated left atrium, severe obstructive sleep apnea, cardiac disease, left systolic ventricular function, AF pattern and ablation technique. Arrhythmia recurrence and reablation were evaluated in both groups using a Cox regression analysis in order to identify predictors. During a 30-month follow-up period, there were no significant differences between older and younger patients in the arrhythmia-free survival (65.1% and 59.7%; log-rank test p=0.403) and complication (10.1% and 10.9%; p>0.999) rates after the index ablation. However, the reablation rate was significantly different (46.7% and 69.2%; p<0.05, respectively). In those patients who underwent reablation procedure (redo subgroups), there were no differences in the incidence of PV reconnection (38.1% redo-older and 27.8% redo-younger patients; p=0.556). However, the redo-older patients had lower reconnected PVs per patient (p<0.01) and lower atrial foci (2.3 and 3.7; p<0.01) than the redo-younger patients. A further important finding was that age was not an independent predictor of arrhythmia recurrence or reablation. Our data reveal that the AF index ablation in older patients had a similar efficacy and safety profile to younger patients. Therefore, age alone must not be considered a prognostic factor for AF ablation but the presence of limiting factors such as frailty and multiple comorbidities.",

    "abstract": "Despite unprecedented investments in public health and biomedical research, improvements in life expectancy and healthy life expectancy have stagnated in the United States. Part of the reason for this development can be traced back to the influence of \"Protean\" over \"Post-Protean\" public health, the names that can be given to two contrasting visions of public health advanced in the early twentieth century. Protean public health prescribes \"waging a war\" against disease and was successful in reducing the early-life mortality risks from infectious disease. But Protean public health has proven less effective in improving the quality of life of older persons. Post-Protean public health prioritizes the experimental method and research into the indirect methods of improving health. It articulated a vision of public heath that was given a more concrete specification by Alex Comfort in what is now referred to as the Geroscience Hypothesis. To improve the health prospects of aging populations the dominance of Protean public health must be relaxed, to enable the benefits of Post-Protean public health to be realized. Doing so means shifting public health's aspirations towards increasing the healthspan vs \"saving lives\" by extending the duration of time older persons can survive by managing the multi-morbidities of late life.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle is characterized by a remarkable capacity to rearrange after physiological changes and efficiently regenerate. However, during aging, extensive injury, or pathological conditions, the complete regenerative program is severely affected, with a progressive loss of muscle mass and function, a condition known as sarcopenia. The compromised tissue repair program is attributable to the gradual depletion of stem cells and to altered regulatory signals. Defective muscle regeneration can severely affect re-innervation by motor axons, and neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) development, ultimately leading to skeletal muscle atrophy. Defects in NMJ formation and maintenance occur physiologically during aging and are responsible for the pathogenesis of several neuromuscular disorders. However, it is still largely unknown how neuromuscular connections are restored on regenerating fibers. It has been suggested that attractive and repelling signals used for axon guidance could be implicated in this process; in particular, guidance molecules called semaphorins play a key role. Semaphorins are a wide family of extracellular regulatory signals with a multifaceted role in cell-cell communication. Originally discovered as axon guidance factors, they have been implicated in cancer progression, embryonal organogenesis, skeletal muscle innervation, and other physiological and developmental functions in different tissues. In particular, in skeletal muscle, specific semaphorin molecules are involved in the restoration and remodeling of the nerve-muscle connections, thus emphasizing their plausible role to ensure the success of muscle regeneration. This review article aims to discuss the impact of aging on skeletal muscle regeneration and NMJs remodeling and will highlight the most recent insights about the role of semaphorins in this context.",

    "abstract": "Our society is aging much faster than it was before, and this phenomenon demands concerted action to optimize geriatric care. Presentations, clinical features, and management decision making are distinct between older adults and general population, and to enhance care quality, there remains unmet needs for undergraduate geriatric education. Among all geriatric syndromes that clinically matter, frailty is particularly instrumental, serving as the overarching phenotype that connects other geriatric conditions and predisposes individuals to adverse outcomes. However, understandings for frailty, or “literacy for frailty” is often poor among healthcare professionals, and misidentification, terminology confusion, and uncertainty surrounding the care of frail older adults, are not uncommon. This lack of frailty literacy undoubtedly contributes to the suboptimal geriatric care patients receive. We therefore propose a rationally designed, concise, and structured program for eliciting medical students’ motivation for understanding frailty during their undergraduate period. Our increasing-frailty-literacy program includes 7 modules, accommodating the terminology, integrative pathogenesis, epidemiology of frailty, appropriate screening and identification tool selection, prognostication and patient communication, and individualization of treatment strategies. In combination with digital technologies and hands-on practice opportunities, we believe that our curriculum can promote medical students’ learning efficacy for frailty and improve geriatric care for the current generation.",

Treatment recommendations for BC patients are primarily driven by patient age, staging and tumor molecular subtype. Thus, we updated the general overview of BC staging, molecular surrogates, and treatment choices for women >70 years based on a systematic study encompassing the years 2013-2023. A PRISMA guidelines and PICO framework were followed, and relevant research articles were searched using different data bases (Web of Sciences, PubMed, MEDLINE, and Scopus). Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used for studies quality assessment. The research articles that made it into the systematic review were compiled using qualitative criteria. In the meanwhile, heterogeneity was determined using meta-analysis with RevMan 5.4. We applied a random effects model with a 0.05 significance level. Overall, there were 4151 research articles, after screening only 17 articles with 39,906 patients were included. Conclusion: Elderly patients with breast cancer should be treated differently in an adapted way. The treatment should not be the same worldwide due to different health systems. Molecular surrogates are different in geriatric patients. Surgery is the best option for treatment in this subset of patients. We need to have therapeutic decision appointments for elderly patients with breast cancer. The guidelines and medical authority should be used in the best decision.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory pain is a common type of pathological pain. Although the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) is key to pathogenesis of inflammatory pain, the underlying specific molecular and cellular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we used mouse models of acute or chronic inflammatory pain, induced by formalin or complete Freund’ s adjuvant (CFA), respectively, to explore whether tyrosine kinase receptor ErbB4 participates in the pathogenesis of inflammatory pain. Firstly, we found that both the expression of Neuregulin 1 (Nrg1) and phosphorylation of ErbB4 receptor were upregulated in DRG after inflammatory pain, implying the activation of ErbB4 in DRG. Using ErbB4-mutant mice, we found reduced pain sensitivity of mice when <i>ErbB4</i> gene expression was largely ablated; furthermore, ErbB4 deletion decreased the inflammatory pain hypersensitivity of either formalin- or CFA-induced mouse models. Moreover, the pain sensitivity was reduced in mice with specific deletion of ErbB4 on advillin-positive neurons within DRG. Importantly, pain hypersensitivity also decreased in <i>Advillin-Cre;ErbB4<sup>-/-</sup></i> cKO mice after formalin- or CFA-induced inflammatory pain. Finally, gene quantification differential expression analysis, using RNAseq technology in combination with GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, suggested that calcium signaling pathway possibly mediated the roles of ErbB4 on DRG sensory neurons in inflammatory pain models. Together, these results indicate that ErbB4 on advillin-positive sensory neurons enhances inflammatory pain sensitivity, providing new clues towards the pathogenic mechanisms of inflammatory pain.",

    "abstract": "Seaweed consumption in Asian food cultures may benefit longevity and age-related conditions like sarcopenia with aging. However, sarcopenia lacks a definitive treatment, and pharmaceutical options have limitations in efficacy and safety. Recent studies on aging female mice found that <i>Ishige okamurae</i> (IO), a brown algae, and its active compound diphloroethohydroxycarmalol improved sarcopenia. Further research is needed to understand the effects of seaweed consumption on sarcopenia in humans. This clinical trial divided participants into a test group (receiving 500 mg/kg IO supplementation, mean±SD; age 62.73±7.18 years, n=40) and a control group (age 63.10±7.06 years, n=40). Hazard analysis assessed vital signs and muscle strength improvement during the trial. Additionally, 12-month-old mice were oral-fed IO at different doses (50, 100, 200 mg/kg) for 6-weeks. Aging and muscle-wasting related markers were evaluated, including grip strength, body weight and compositions, serum-parameters, and molecular-changes. The clinical trial found no significant changes in toxicity-parameters between the groups (p>0.05) after 12-weeks of IO supplementation. The IO group exhibited a remarkable increase in lower-limb quadriceps muscle-strength compared to the control (p=0.002). Furthermore, IO treatment improved age-related decline in quadriceps strength in the subgroup; under 61-years-old (p=0.004), without significant differences in foot-dominancy between groups (p=0.171). In 12-month-old male mice, IO administration improved age-related deficiencies in grip strength (p<0.0001) and testosterone (p=0.0001). Muscular regeneration parameters, such as lean-mass (p<0.0001), inhibition of proteolysis (measured by changes in myogenin and atrogin-1 protein expressions), cross-sectional myofiber area (p<0.0001), number of satellite cells (p=0.0001), and increased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes in muscle tissue indicative of mitochondrial biogenesis, were also improved by IO administration. This trial is the first to explore the positive association between consuming brown-algae IO and age-related decreases in muscle strength. IO treatment helps maintain muscle mass and delays muscle wasting during aging, suggesting it as a potent nutritional strategy to protect against aging-associated sarcopenia.",

    "abstract": "Geographic atrophy (GA) is an advanced form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), that starts with atrophic lesions in the outer retina that expand to cover the macula and fovea, leading to severe vision loss over time. Pigment Epithelium-Derived Factor (PEDF) has a diverse-range of properties, including its ability to promote cell survival, reduce inflammation, inhibit angiogenesis, combat oxidative stress, regulate autophagy, and stimulate anti-apoptotic pathways, making it a promising therapeutic candidate for GA. However, the relatively short half-life of PEDF protein has precluded its potential as a clinical therapy for GA since it would require frequent injections. Therefore, we describe administration of a PEDF gene, comparing and contrasting delivery routes, viral and non-viral vectors, and consider the critical challenges for PEDF as a neuroprotectant for GA.",

    "abstract": "Tauopathies, a group of neurodegenerative disorders, are characterized by disrupted homeostasis of the microtubule binding protein tau. Nogo-A mainly hinders axonal growth and development in neurons, but the underlying mechanism of tau vulnerability has not been determined. Here, to gain more comprehensive insights into the impact of Nogo-A on tau protein expression, we showed that Nogo-A induces tau hyperphosphorylation, synapse loss and cognitive dysfunction. Consistent with the biological function of tau hyperphosphorylation, Nogo-A-induced tau hyperphosphorylation altered microtubule stability, which causes synaptic dysfunction. Mechanistically, Nogo-A-induced tau hyperphosphorylation was abolished by the Nogo-A antagonist NEP1-40 in primary neurons. Surprisingly, downregulation of Nogo-A in the hippocampus of AD mice (hTau. P301S) inhibited tau hyperphosphorylation at the AT8, Thr181, The231 and Ser404 sites and rescued synaptic loss and cognitive impairment in AD mice. Our findings exhibit a strong degree of consistency with Nogo-A-induced tauopathy vulnerability, reinforcing the coherence and reliability of our research. Furthermore, in mice, Nogo-A increases tauopathy vulnerability to exacerbate AD progression via ROCK/AKT/GSK3β signaling. Together, our findings provide new insight into the function of Nogo-A in regulating tau hyperphosphorylation and reveal an effective treatment strategy for tauopathies.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifests as a complex systems pathology with intricate interplay among various genes and biological processes. Traditional differential gene expression (DEG) analysis, while commonly employed to characterize AD-driven perturbations, does not sufficiently capture the full spectrum of underlying biological processes. Utilizing single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data from postmortem brain samples across key regions-middle temporal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, and entorhinal cortex-we provide a comprehensive systematic analysis of disrupted processes in AD. We go beyond the DEG-centric analysis by integrating pathway activity analysis with weighted gene co-expression patterns to comprehensively map gene interconnectivity, identifying region- and cell-type-specific drivers of biological processes associated with AD. Our analysis reveals profound modular heterogeneity in neurons and glia as well as extensive AD-related functional disruptions. Co-expression networks highlighted the extended involvement of astrocytes and microglia in biological processes beyond neuroinflammation, such as calcium homeostasis, glutamate regulation, lipid metabolism, vesicle-mediated transport, and TOR signaling. We find limited representation of DEGs within dysregulated pathways across neurons and glial cells, suggesting that differential gene expression alone may not adequately represent the disease complexity. Further dissection of inferred gene modules revealed distinct dynamics of hub DEGs in neurons versus glia, suggesting that DEGs exert more impact on neurons compared to glial cells in driving modular dysregulations underlying perturbed biological processes. Interestingly, we observe an overall downregulation of astrocyte and microglia modules across all brain regions in AD, indicating a prevailing trend of functional repression in glial cells across these regions. Notable genes from the CALM and HSP90 families emerged as hub genes across neuronal modules in all brain regions, suggesting conserved roles as drivers of synaptic dysfunction in AD. Our findings demonstrate the importance of an integrated, systems-oriented approach combining pathway and network analysis to comprehensively understand the cell-type-specific roles of genes in AD-related biological processes.",

    "abstract": "Characterization of cognitive profiles across genetic FTD gene mutations is crucial for the identification of sensitive endpoints for clinical trials targeting specific pathologies. However, no systematic overview of the literature describing cognitive profiles in different FTD gene mutations has been made thus far. We performed a meta-analysis and systematic review to characterize cognitive profiles across the different FTD gene mutations and clinical disease stages of familial frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We included 27 studies comparing presymptomatic (n=1027), and/or symptomatic (n=574) mutation carriers (GRN, MAPT, C9orf72) with controls (n=1296). We extracted cognitive data and grouped them into six cognitive domains (language, attention and mental processing speed, executive function (EF), memory, social cognition, and visuospatial abilities). These domains were further subdivided into specific cognitive sub-processes. We calculated Hedges' g and performed multilevel meta-analyses per cognitive domain and FTD gene mutation comparing presymptomatic and symptomatic mutation carriers to controls. Moderator analyses were performed to the effect of age, education, sex, and cognitive subprocess. Eleven studies into rarer FTD mutations were included in the systematic review. Presymptomatic GRN mutation carriers showed deficits in EF, and presymptomatic C9orf72 mutation carriers in language, EF, and attention. Presymptomatic MAPT mutation carriers did not differ from controls on any of the cognitive domains. All symptomatic mutation carriers had deficits in language, EF, attention, and memory. Both in the presymptomatic and symptomatic stage cognitive sub-processes for language, attention and mental processing speed, EF, and memory were differentially affected in GRN, MAPT, and C9orf72. Cognitive decline was present in the presymptomatic stage of GRN and C9orf72 mutation carriers, but not MAPT mutation carriers. Unique cognitive sub-processes were affected in GRN, MAPT, and C9orf72. This study increased our knowledge of the cognitive deficits in familial FTD, which can aid in differential diagnosis and selection of endpoints for clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease that manifests clinically as memory loss and so on. Neuroinflammation plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease. Meanwhile, widely distributed throughout the central nervous system, substance P exhibits important pro-inflammatory properties. The level of substance P is found to correlate with the course of Alzheimer's disease. Substance P can modulate the protein hydrolysis of amyloid precursor protein, the voltage-gated potassium channel, and the protein hydrolysis of this channel, exerting neuroprotective effects. At the same time, substance P can also exert damaging effects by mediating neuroinflammation, inhibiting cellular autophagy, activating mast cells, acting on leukocytes and altering blood-brain barrier permeability. Based on the complex manifestations of substance P in Alzheimer's disease, this review discusses both protective and damaging mechanisms, and plausible explanations for the double-edged effect of substance P, providing an outlook for future research focusing on substance P and Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Although age-related deterioration of the cardiac function is a well-studied area of research, the interventions and their molecular pathways have not yet been fully identified. Since physical activity is a powerful preventive measure against cardiac aging, our study compared the effects of long-term voluntary and forced physical activity with a sedentary group, utilizing an aging rat model characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction that contributes to age-related cardiovascular diseases. Four experimental groups were created: (I) young controls (12-week-old); (II) 18-month-old aged sedentary rats; (III) aged group with free access to running wheels for 6 months; (IV) aged rats subjected to forced physical activity for 6 months. At the endpoint of the study, the aged animals were two years old. The aged sedentary rats exhibited increased Tei-index, LA/Ao and E/e' ratios as well as decreased e'/a' ratio and lengthened DecT and IVRT, higher perivascular fibrosis ratio and reduced myocardial PKG, STAT3 and Opa1 protein expression, along with decreased ATP synthase (ATPS) activity in comparison to the young controls. In terms of echocardiographic parameters and perivascular fibrosis, the forced running provided more substantial benefits than the voluntary activity demonstrated by decreased Tei-index, E/e' ratio, increased e'/a' ratio and reduced DecT and IVRT. Forced exercise was strongly associated with elevated myocardial expression of PKG, STAT3 and Opa1 proteins and, moreover, the ATPS activity was restored only in the forced running rats. In conclusion, forced but not voluntary exercise has significant protective effects on age-associated diastolic dysfunction by upregulating PKG-STAT3-Opa1 axis and thereby enhancing ATPS activity.",

    "abstract": "Path integration (PI), which supports navigation without external spatial cues, is facilitated by grid cells in the entorhinal cortex. These cells are often impaired in individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, other brain systems can compensate for this impairment, especially when spatial cues are available. From a graph-theoretical perspective, this compensatory mechanism might manifest through changes in network segregation, indicating shifts in distinct functional roles among specialized brain regions. This study explored whether similar compensatory mechanisms are active in APOE ε4 carriers and individuals with elevated insulin resistance, both susceptible to entorhinal cortex dysfunction. We applied a graph-theoretical segregation index to resting-state fMRI data from two cohorts (aged 50-75) to assess PI performance across virtual environments. Although insulin resistance did not directly impair PI performance, individuals with higher insulin resistance demonstrated better PI with less segregated brain networks, regardless of spatial cue availability. In contrast, the APOE effect was cue-dependent: ε4 heterozygotes outperformed ε3 homozygotes in the presence of local landmarks, linked to increased sensorimotor network segregation. When spatial cues were absent, ε4 carriers exhibited reduced PI performance due to lower segregation in the secondary visual network. Controlling cortical thickness and intracortical myelin variability mitigated these APOE effects on PI, with no similar adjustment made for insulin resistance. Our findings suggest that ε4 carriers depend on cortical integrity and spatial landmarks for successful navigation, while insulin-resistant individuals may rely on less efficient neural mechanisms for processing PI. These results highlight the importance of targeting insulin resistance to prevent cognitive decline, particularly in aging navigation and spatial cognition.",

While the increased ICP is a critical diagnostic feature, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain unclear. Previous theories have suggested cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) overproduction, impaired reabsorption, or circulatory obstruction as potential causes. Emerging evidence indicates that IIH may not be solely a central nervous system disorder but also a systemic metabolic disorder. Metabolic and hormonal dysregulation features, including hyperleptinemia, adipocyte leptin hypersecretion, increased insulin resistance, and androgen excess, have been noted in IIH. Furthermore, the targeted blockade of the cortisol-producing enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 has demonstrated therapeutic potential in treating IIH. Consequently, the role of metabolic dysfunction and hormonal imbalance in IIH warrants consideration. This review aims to provide a comprehensive update on current theories regarding the mechanisms of metabolic dysfunction in IIH.",

Our study explores the role of astrogliosis in the brainstem retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), a key breathing regulatory center, and its impact on breathing control and AD pathology in mice. Using Tg-2576 AD and wild-type mice, we investigated the effect of silencing the transforming growth factor-beta receptor II (TGFβR II) in the RTN. We performed behavioral tests, including the Barnes maze and novel object recognition test, along with whole-body plethysmography to assess breathing disorders. Our results showed that AD mice exhibited increased apneas and cognitive impairment, which were significantly mitigated following TGFβR II gene silencing. Immunohistochemistry revealed elevated levels of GFAP and TGFβR II in the RTN of AD mice, which were reduced post-gene silencing, alongside a decrease in amyloid-beta expression in the cortex and hippocampus. These findings suggest that targeting astrogliosis and improving respiratory control may offer a novel therapeutic avenue for managing Alzheimer's disease.

    "abstract": "Homeostatic imbalance and lung function decline are central physiological characteristics of aging and susceptibility to respiratory diseases. Senescence contributes to tissue damage and alveolar epithelial cell injury and decreases reparative capacity. Alveolar type II (ATII) cells have stem cell potential and self-renew to regenerate the alveoli after damage. They were isolated from younger and older non-smoker and smoker organ donors to define their function in the lung. Smoking and older age increased ATII cell senescence as detected by high β-galactosidase activity and P21 levels by Western blotting and RT-PCR. Also, the number of ATII cells was the lowest in lung tissue in older smokers. This was associated with increased stress signaling, as shown by elevated 4-HNE and G3BP1 expression in ATII cells, and inflammation indicated by high IL-8 levels in BAL fluid. In addition, DNA damage and decreased repair were observed using the comet assay, especially in ATII cells isolated from older smokers. This was accompanied by the highest levels of cytosolic double-strand DNA in this group and correlated with the activated cGAS-STING pathway and increased IRF3 expression. Moreover, telomere shortening, accumulation of TERRA molecules, and increased ZBP1 protein expression in ATII cells were associated with smoking and older age. Reduced NRF2 and DJ-1 expression in ATII cells was detected by Western blotting, especially in older smokers, which suggests an antioxidant defense system dysfunction. Our study provides insights into the impaired interconnected signaling network, which can contribute to ATII cell senescence.",

However, emerging studies suggest that increases in these age-related pathologies may link to heritable alterations in the control of cellular bioenergetics induced by the parental environment. Because our preclinical studies examining the fetal offspring of alcohol-exposed males and females have consistently identified epigenetic alterations in mitochondrial activity, we hypothesized that chronic parental alcohol exposure programs an increased predisposition of offspring to develop liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma induced by an environmental toxicant. Here, we employed a multiplex mouse model to compare the sensitivities of male offspring derived from maternal, paternal, and dual-parental alcohol exposures to the potent hepatocellular carcinoma inducer Diethylnitrosamine and determine their predisposition for tumor formation and growth. Our analysis reveals that parental alcohol exposures disrupt the activity of offspring mitochondrial complex I in the liver, promoting enduring oxidative stress and activating Transforming Growth Factor β signaling. This lasting imbalance correlates with increased Interleukin 6 production, promoting an inflammatory precancerous state. In male offspring, chronic parental alcohol consumption leads to increased tumor incidence, multiplicity, and size. Significantly, maternal and paternal alcohol use interact in driving the progression of toxicant-induced liver disease, with some adverse outcomes of dual-parental offspring exceeding those caused by either maternal or paternal alcohol use alone. We conclude that chronic parental alcohol use alters mitochondrial complex I activity and immune function, predisposing male offspring to a proinflammatory precancerous state.",

    "abstract": "Since the association between mitochondria and aging was first identified, significant efforts have been devoted to elucidating the role of mitochondrial DNA mutations in the aging process. Due to their age-dependent accumulation, intrinsically high mutation rates, and defective replication mechanisms, mtDNA mutations have often been regarded as pivotal drivers of aging. This has led to certain intuitive yet inherently limited conclusions. Aging, however, is a multifactorial process, and the role of mtDNA cannot be simply categorized in binary terms, as its influence emerges as a composite vector of numerous interconnected physiological processes. Adopting alternative perspectives may mitigate the discrepancies between theoretical expectations and empirical findings, offering new directions and insights for future research.",

    "abstract": "Brain diseases complexity have necessitated advanced research platforms for better understanding, treatment, and prevention strategies. However, existing brain disease registries face limitations such as incomplete variable sets, lack of standardization, insufficient linkage to external databases, absence of integrated platforms for comprehensive data collection, and lack of continuity. To address these challenges, the Korea National Institute of Health initiated the Brain disease Research Infrastructure for Data Gathering and Exploration (BRIDGE), a national prospective platform designed to overcome the shortcomings of current registries. The BRIDGE platform includes a Longitudinal Study of Early onset dementia And Family members (LEAF) cohort, a Longitudinal/cohort Study of Patients with Late Onset Dementia (LLOD) cohort, a community-based cohort study of High-risk individuals for Dementia (COHD) cohort, and a Longitudinal Study of Patients with Parkinson's Disease (LoPD) cohort. The standardized variables included sociodemographic variables, health behaviors, medical history, activities of daily living, behavioral, and psychological problems, cognitive function, disease-related symptoms, quality of life (QoL), sleep, depression scale, caregiver burden, physical health, blood tests, olfactory function testing, orthostatic blood pressure changes, genetic testing, nerve conduction studies, and neuroimaging. In addition, the BRIDGE platform will be linked to the Korean National Health Insurance Service (K-NHIS) database. By addressing gaps in data collection, standardization, and considering a wide range of impacts, the BRIDGE database offers new pathways for understanding and combating complex brain conditions. As the project progresses, it has the potential to significantly influence scientific understanding and policymaking in the field of brain health.",

    "abstract": "The study of Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) has garnered considerable attention due to its critical implications in assessing and understanding both female and male fertility potential. Traditionally, AMH is recognized for its pivotal role in evaluating ovarian reserve and is a cornerstone in reproductive health assessments for women. The aim of this study was to challenge the traditional interpretation of AMH as a standalone predictor of IVF success. Through a retrospective analysis of 600 patients undergoing ICSI, we reveal that women with low AMH levels, traditionally classified as poor responders, can achieve unexpectedly high oocyte numbers, blastocyst formation, and pregnancy rates. This highlights the limitations of using AMH alone to predict IVF outcomes. Our findings advocate the importance of integrating additional factors, such as follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and the need for a more individualized approach to fertility treatment planning.",

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common musculoskeletal disease globally and is the main reason for the chronic pain and disability in people over sixty-five worldwide. Degradation of the articular cartilage, synovial inflammation and osteophyte formation are widely acknowledged as the primary pathological manifestations of OA. OA affects more than 300 million people all over the world, bringing extremely large socioeconomic burden. Unfortunately, there's so far, no disease-modified drugs to treat it, and techniques for early detection are absent. Photoacoustic imaging is a promising imaging method based on photothermal effects, which shows enormous potential in precisely monitoring the development of OA and tracking the drug treatment progress. Photothermal therapy is a non-invasive treatment curing diseases by converting the energy from light to heat through tissue absorption. Ample research evidence verifies the efficacy of photothermal therapy in treating OA. This narrative review covered recent advances of photosensitive nanomaterials applied in OA and illustrated the potential of them in diagnosing and treating OA, hoping it could pave the way for the following theranostics and clinical transition of OA.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid cascade hypothesis proposes that amyloid β (Aβ) accumulation is the initiator and major contributor to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, this hypothesis has recently been challenged by clinical studies showing that reduction of Aβ accumulation in the brain does not accompany with cognitive improvement, suggesting that therapeutically targeting Aβ in the brain may not be sufficient for restoring cognitive function. Since the molecular mechanism underlying the progressive development of cognitive impairment after Aβ clearance is largely unknown, the reason of why there is no behavioral improvement after Aβ clearance remains elusive. In the current study, we demonstrated that transient Aβ expression caused learning deficit in later life, despite the accumulated Aβ was soon being removed after the expression. Early Aβ exposure decreased the cellular expression of XBP1 and both the antioxidants, catalase, and dPrx5, which made cells more vulnerable to oxidative stress in later life. Early induction of XBP1, catalase, and dPrx5 prevented the overproduction of ROS, improved the learning performance, and preserved the viability of cells in the later life with the early Aβ induction. Treating the early Aβ exposed flies with antioxidants such as vitamin E, melatonin and lipoic acid, after the removal of Aβ also preserved the learning ability in later life. Taken together, we demonstrated that early and transient Aβ exposure can have a profound impact on animal behavior in later life and also revealed the cellular and molecular mechanism underlying the development of learning impairment by the early and transient Aβ exposure.",

So, the purpose of the present study was to identify the clustering of behavioural and eating habits related to non-communicable disease in Brazilian elderly, and to estimate the association of these profiles with overweight/obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. This is a cross-sectional based-population study, which sample comes from the VIGITEL 2019 survey. The sample comprised 23,327 subjects (16,295 women), mean age of 71 years. Sociodemographic and anthropometric data (i.e., age, sex, body weight, and body height), health-related information (i.e., eating habits, physical activity and sedentary behaviour, and alcohol consumption), health status and morbidity (diabetes and hypertension) were self-reported. Latent Classes Analysis, and binary logistic regression were performed, considering p<0.05. Results showed that two different classes were identified. Those called as “TV viewer, but no unhealthy diet” presented more chances to have hypertension (OR: 1.213; 95%CI: 1.064-1.382) and diabetes (OR: 1.365; 95%CI: 1.157-1.610), when compared to their peers called as “healthy diet and active”. Age, educational level, and sex were associated with hypertension and diabetes. In conclusion, a better health clustered-behaviour was associated with better disease outcomes in Brazilian elderly population.",

    "abstract": "Informal caregivers of people with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) experience unique stressors, reduced quality of life, and report poorer health, compared to non-caregivers. Throughout the last thirty years, researchers have developed and tested various psychosocial interventions and their ability to improve caregiver health. Due to an exclusive focus on self-report methods, however, no existing systematic literature reviews specifically examine intervention studies employing biomarkers; this systematic review aims to address this gap in the literature. In each database (PubMed and Web of Science, respectively), a title search was conducted with the following keywords: “alzheimer*” OR “dementia” AND “caregiv*” AND “intervention”, followed by a second search using identical keywords except “intervention” was replaced with “program.” Study or intervention protocol articles, exclusively qualitative studies, cultural applicability papers, dissemination studies, descriptive articles or program reports, acceptability/feasibility studies, studies utilizing formal caregiving samples, commentaries, review papers, and meta-analyses, erratums/corrections, measure development articles, factor analyses, and case reports were excluded from the final pool of studies. In this systematic review, the findings of 14 studies are summarized, and are organized based on specific types of biomarkers: neuroendocrine, immune, and autonomic physiological. Overall, the review yielded mixed results, which may, in part, be due to differences in the types of interventions tested, as well as differing biomarker measurement, methodology, and analysis. More biobehavioral intervention trials are needed among ADRD caregivers. Including biological parameters as pre- and post-measures can shed insight into the extent to which interventions may help caregivers heal from the stress of caregiving.",

SARS-CoV-2 can target and damage mitochondria, potentially leading to mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). This study aimed to evaluate single nucleotide substitutions in mtDNA and analyze their correlation with inflammatory biomarkers in elderly COVID-19 patients. A total of 30 COVID-19 patients and 33 older adult controls without COVID-19 (aged over 65 years) were enrolled. mtDNA was extracted from buffy coat samples and sequenced using a chip-based resequencing system (MitoChip v2.0) which detects both homoplasmic and heteroplasmic mtDNA variants (40-60% heteroplasmy) and allows the assessment of low-level heteroplasmy (<10% heteroplasmy). Serum concentrations of IL-6, IFN-α, TNF-α and IL-10 were determined in patients by a high-sensitivity immunoassay. We found a higher burden of total heteroplasmic variants in COVID-19 patients compared to controls with a selective increment in ND1 and COIII genes. Low-level heteroplasmy was significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients, especially in genes of the respiratory complex I. Both heteroplasmic variant burden and low-level heteroplasmy were associated with increased levels of IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-α. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may induce mtDNA mutations that are related to the degree of inflammation.",

Furthermore, APOE methylation pattern has been described to be associated with the disease and to follow a bimodal pattern, with a hypermethylated CpG island and a hypomethylated promoter region. However, little is known about the methylation levels in the APOE 5'UTR region. Here, the methylation of two regions (R1 and R2) within APOE 5'UTR was investigated in both peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and hippocampus (HIC) samples to identify differentially methylated CpG sites and to associate clinical, genetic features and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers levels. DNA was extracted from PBMCs of 20 AD and 20 healthy controls (HC) and from 6 AD and 3 HC HIC samples. The methylation analysis was carried out by means of pyrosequencing. In AD PBMCs we found that R1 region displayed a higher methylation level, while the opposite trend was observed in R2. The presence of ε4 allele highlighted a marked increase in R1 methylation level and a decrease in R2. In AD PBMCs and HIC, age progression resulted to be associated with an increase in the methylation level of R1. Lastly, the methylation of a CpG site in R2 was found to be related to CSF biomarkers. Despite the lack of a statistical significance, the outcome from this exploratory analysis highlighted the presence of a difference in methylation in APOE 5'UTR in PBMCs of AD patients which seemed to be associated also with APOE genotype, age and CSF biomarkers level.",

It is the result of the failure of a complex, active, and highly regulated process - much of which is still not well understood. Some of our understanding of ectopic calcification come from studies on diseases such as atherosclerosis, aortic valve disease and kidney stone disease. In the eye, the most common causes of visual defects due to ectopic calcification include optic disc drusen (ODD) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In ODD, ectopic calcification occurs only in the most anterior, unmyelinated portion of optic nerve - the sole output of the eye and particularly susceptible to hypoxic and metabolic stress. In this article, we review the effects of hypoxia on mitochondrial function and calcium regulation and delineate the key processes likely involved in ectopic calcification. We propose a working hypothesis for ODD centering on the role of hypoxia-induced calcium and phosphate overload, mitochondrial dysfunction and osteogenic differentiation, leading to hydroxyapatite deposition and biomineralization.",

    "abstract": "Dear Editor,\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of the 2012 annual meeting of the American Society of Human Genetics in San Francisco, the scientific press concluded to a sobering genetic influences on disease remain hidden after discussing, among others, the progress made in the field of cardiovascular genetics [1]. In a recent attempt to resolve some of the inconsistent findings, Zhang and coworkers [2] have presented a quantitative analysis of APOC3 variants in coronary heart disease. Unfortunately, only a fraction of the previously published data have been considered and, using the authors’ inclusion criteria, over 10000 alleles are missing from the investigation [3-8]. What is more, incorrect allele counts have led to biased effects for the SstI polymorphism, causing the risk-enhancing allele to become protective [9] and vice versa [10]. Allele counts for the T-455C variant also differ from the published data [11] and are further compromised by duplicates from overlapping samples [11,12]. With regard to both T-455C and C-482T, the vast majority of allele frequencies reported in Table 1 of the article [2] are either in error [11,13-18], missing [12], or entirely fictional [19]. Finally, failure to identify C3175G as a synonym of the SstI polymorphism has led to the omission of more alleles from a publication which served to extract data on T-455C and C-482T [13].\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the article calls for numerous issues to be ironed out prior to claiming, or to refuting, significant effects of the three APOC3 variants on coronary heart disease susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "In December 2019, the People's Republic of China and the World Health Organization first reported on a cluster of pneumonia with an unknown cause. Nine months later more than 1.4 million people have died from COVID 19. In this work, the effects of the COVID 19 pandemic on five nursing homes in Austria, which cared for 889 residents in the first half of 2020, were examined. The research question was whether the measures taken were appropriate to prevent an outbreak within the individual facilities. To detect previously unrecognized infections, the present study evaluated the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in residents and employees of the nursing homes. Following the analysis of blood samples, the prospectively collected data was connected to data from screening examinations and data from contact tracing. The present study demonstrated an overall prevalence of neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in nursing homes of 3.7%. Whereas the prevalence in those facilities that have never been hit by an outbreak is 0%, the prevalence in those facilities with an outbreak is up to 4.9%. Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 35 persons. A retrospective analysis of all 5 included nursing homes demonstrated that upon regular clinical screening in combination with PCRs an infection with SARS-COV-2 was detected in 66 residents and 24 employees from different professional groups. In only 25 of the 35 persons with neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 an infection was proven in advance. This study suggests that specific measures can prevent transmission within a health care facility. Nevertheless, the results also show that a risk reduction to 0% cannot be achieved. In preparation for further pandemic waves there is still the need to reduce the probability of a transmission in nursing homes with specific test strategies.",

    "abstract": "Aging is characterized by progressive multisystem deterioration driven by molecular and cellular mechanisms encapsulated in the twelve hallmarks of aging. Green tea (GT), derived from Camellia sinensis, has garnered significant scientific interest due to its rich polyphenolic composition, particularly epigallocatechin-3-gallate, and its pleiotropic health benefits. In this narrative review, we explored the multifaceted mechanisms through which GT may mitigate the aging hallmarks. Evidence from in vitro, animal, and human studies has shown that GT polyphenols can enhance DNA repair pathways, preserve telomere length, modulate epigenetic aging markers, improve proteostasis and autophagic flux, regulate nutrient-sensing networks, and rejuvenate mitochondrial function. Additionally, GT exhibits anti-inflammatory properties and may restore a physiological gut microbiota composition. Beyond molecular and cellular effects, GT consumption in humans has been associated with improved cognitive function, cardiovascular health, muscle preservation, and metabolic regulation in aging populations. Collectively, these findings highlight GT's potential as a naturally occurring geroscience intervention capable of addressing the interconnected network of aging processes more comprehensively than single-target pharmaceuticals. Future research should focus on optimizing dosing regimens, exploring synergies with other anti-aging strategies, and investigating personalized responses to GT interventions.",

Therefore, we review the possible immune mechanisms and pathological interactions between COVID-19 and RA, as the uncontrolled immune activation and cytokine response in COVID-19 resemble the immune inflammation of RA. We also discuss the potential mechanisms that may lead to cardiovascular complications as well as the challenges of treating RA patients with COVID-19. While several therapeutic agents are being developed to cure COVID-19, antirheumatic drugs could also be potential options due to the similar proinflammatory cytokines induced in both diseases. Additionally, we discuss the safety and effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and novel therapeutic approaches against RA based on the shared mechanisms between COVID-19 and RA.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic, often referred to as the geropandemic, has put immense pressure on global healthcare systems worldwide, leading to a rush in the development and approval of medications for the treatment of the viral infection. Clinical trials on efficacy and safety had a limited spectrum on inclusion and endpoints because of the urgent need for fast results. The chronologically and biologically aged population is especially at risk for severe or lethal disease, as well as treatment-associated toxicity. In China, the growing elderly population segment has been a focus in public health measurements of COVID-19, guiding towards herd immunity with a mild variant, thus minimizing overall deaths and morbidity. While the COVID-19 pandemic has now been reclassified and the virus weakened, there is a clear need for novel therapies to protect the elderly. This paper reviews the current safety and efficacy of available COVID-19 medications in China, with a specific focus on 3CL protease inhibitors and the aging population. The current COVID wave in China has demonstrated a significant impact on the elderly and the need for new drugs that are effective at low doses and can be used alone, without harmful side effects, generation of viral resistance, and drug-drug interactions. The rush to develop and approve COVID-19 medications has brought up important questions about the balance between speed and caution, resulting in a pipeline of novel therapies now moving through clinical trials, including third-generation 3CL protease inhibitors. A majority of those therapeutics are being developed in China.",

Here, we amend these hypotheses and propose an eco-centric model for geroplasticity (aging plasticity including aging reversal). According to this model, youth and aging are plastic and require constant maintenance, and, respectively, engage a host of endogenous rejuvenating (rejuvenins) and gero-inducing [geriatrin] factors. Aging in this model is akin to atrophy that occurs as a result of damage or withdrawal of trophic factors. Rejuvenins maintain and geriatrins adversely impact cellular homeostasis, cell fitness, and proliferation, stem cell pools, damage response and repair. Rejuvenins reduce and geriatrins increase the age-related disorders, inflammatory signaling, and senescence and adjust the epigenetic clock. When viewed through this perspective, aging can be successfully reversed by supplementation with rejuvenins and by reducing the levels of geriatrins.",

Though several kinds of vaccines are currently available, emergence of new variants, spike mutations and immune escape have raised new challenges. Pregnant women are vulnerable to respiratory infections due to their altered immune defence and surveillance functions. Besides, whether pregnant persons should receive a COVID-19 vaccine is still under debate because limited data are available on the efficacy and safety of receiving a vaccine during pregnancy. Physiological features and lack of effective protection making pregnant women at high risk of getting infected. Another concern is that pregnancy may trigger the onset of underlying existing neurological disease, which is highly similar to those neurological symptoms of pregnant women caused by COVID-19. These similarities interfere with diagnosis and delay timely and effective management. Therefore, providing efficient emergency support for pregnant women suffering from neurological symptoms caused by COVID-19 remains a challenge among neurologists and obstetricians. To improve the diagnosis and treatment efficiency of pregnant women with neurological symptoms, we propose an emergency management framework based on the clinicians' experience and available resources. This emergency care system aimed at addressing the conundrums faced by the emergency guarantee system under COVID-19 pandemic and could serve as a potential multisystem project for clinical practice and medical education.",

    "abstract": "Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in nursing homes is poorly documented. Using surveillance data of 228 European private nursing homes, we estimated weekly SARS-CoV-2 incidences among 21,467 residents and 14,371 staff members, compared to that in the general population, between August 3, 2020, and February 20, 2021. We studied the outcomes of \"episodes of introduction\" where one case was first detected and computed attack rates, reproduction ratio (R), and dispersion parameter (k). Out of 502 episodes of SARS-CoV-2 introduction, 77.1% (95%CI, 73.2%-80.6%) led to additional cases. Attack rates were highly variable, ranging from 0.4% to 86.5%. The R was 1.16 (95%CI, 1.11-1.22) with k at 2.5 (95%CI, 0.5-4.5). The timing of viral circulation in nursing homes did not mirror that in the general population (p-values<0.001). We estimated the impact of vaccination in preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Before vaccination's roll-out, a cumulated 5,579 SARS-CoV-2 infections were documented among residents and 2,321 among staff. Higher staffing ratio and previous natural immunization reduced the probability of an outbreak following introduction. Despite strong preventive measures, transmission likely occurred, regardless of building characteristics. Vaccination started on January 15, 2021, and coverage reached 65.0% among residents, and 42.0% among staff by February 20, 2021. Vaccination yielded a 92% reduction (95%CI, 71%-98%) of outbreak probability, and lowered R to 0.87 (95%CI, 0.69-1.10). In the post-pandemic era, much attention will have to be paid to multi-lateral collaboration, policy making, and prevention plans.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is an ongoing pandemic causing severe health crisis worldwide. Recovered COVID-19 patients go through several long-term side effects such as fatigue, headaches, dizziness, weight loss, and muscle loss among others. Our study sought to determine the molecular mechanisms behind muscle loss in COVID-19 patients. We hypothesized that multiple factors such as cytokine storm and therapeutic drugs (glucocorticoid and antiviral drugs) might be involved in muscle loss. Using the Gene Expression Omnibus database, we identified several studies that performed RNA sequencing on skeletal muscles with the treatment of cytokine, glucocorticoid, and antiviral drugs. Our study identified cytokines, such as IL-1b, and IL-6, associated with altered regulation of several genes involved in the myogenic processes, including Ttn, Cxxc5, Malat1, and Foxo1. We also observed that glucocorticoid altered the expression of Foxo1, Lcn2, Slc39a14, and Cdkn1a. Finally, we found out that the antiviral (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor) drug regulates the expression of some of the muscle-related genes (Txnip, Ccnd1, Hdac9, and Fbxo32). Based on our findings, we hypothesize that the cytokine storm, glucocorticoids, and antiviral drugs might be synergistically involved in COVID-19-dependent muscle loss.",
