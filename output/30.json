    "abstract": "Software systems dealing with distributed applications in changing environments normally require human supervision to continue operation in all conditions. These (re-)configuring, troubleshooting, and in general maintenance tasks lead to costly and time-consuming procedures during the operating phase. These problems are primarily due to the open-loop structure often followed in software development. Therefore, there is a high demand for management complexity reduction, management automation, robustness, and achieving all of the desired quality requirements within a reasonable cost and time range during operation. Self-adaptive software is a response to these demands; it is a closed-loop system with a feedback loop aiming to adjust itself to changes during its operation. These changes may stem from the software system's self (internal causes, e.g., failure) or context (external events, e.g., increasing requests from users). Such a system is required to monitor itself and its context, detect significant changes, decide how to react, and act to execute such decisions. These processes depend on adaptation properties (called self-* properties), domain characteristics (context information or models), and preferences of stakeholders. Noting these requirements, it is widely believed that new models and frameworks are needed to design self-adaptive software. This survey article presents a taxonomy, based on concerns of adaptation, that is, how , what , when and where , towards providing a unified view of this emerging area. Moreover, as adaptive systems are encountered in many disciplines, it is imperative to learn from the theories and models developed in these other areas. This survey article presents a landscape of research in self-adaptive software by highlighting relevant disciplines and some prominent research projects. This landscape helps to identify the underlying research gaps and elaborates on the corresponding challenges.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic capacity provisioning is a useful technique for handling the multi-time-scale variations seen in Internet workloads. In this article, we propose a novel dynamic provisioning technique for multi-tier Internet applications that employs (1) a flexible queuing model to determine how much of the resources to allocate to each tier of the application, and (2) a combination of predictive and reactive methods that determine when to provision these resources, both at large and small time scales. We propose a novel data center architecture based on virtual machine monitors to reduce provisioning overheads. Our experiments on a forty-machine Xen/Linux-based hosting platform demonstrate the responsiveness of our technique in handling dynamic workloads. In one scenario where a flash crowd caused the workload of a three-tier application to double, our technique was able to double the application capacity within five minutes, thus maintaining response-time targets. Our technique also reduced the overhead of switching servers across applications from several minutes to less than a second, while meeting the performance targets of residual sessions.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in information technology have brought about important changes in distributed computing. New environments such as massively large-scale, wide-area computer networks and mobile ad hoc networks have emerged. Common characteristics of these environments include extreme dynamicity, unreliability, and large scale. Traditional approaches to designing distributed applications in these environments based on central control, small scale, or strong reliability assumptions are not suitable for exploiting their enormous potential. Based on the observation that living organisms can effectively organize large numbers of unreliable and dynamically-changing components (cells, molecules, individuals, etc.) into robust and adaptive structures, it has long been a research challenge to characterize the key ideas and mechanisms that make biological systems work and to apply them to distributed systems engineering. In this article we propose a conceptual framework that captures several basic biological processes in the form of a family of design patterns. Examples include plain diffusion, replication, chemotaxis, and stigmergy. We show through examples how to implement important functions for distributed computing based on these patterns. Using a common evaluation methodology, we show that our bio-inspired solutions have performance comparable to traditional, state-of-the-art solutions while they inherit desirable properties of biological systems including adaptivity and robustness.",

Agents can dynamically enter and exit a network and can autonomously clone and migrate themselves in response to environmental changes.

    "abstract": "The challenges of pervasive and mobile computing environments, which are highly dynamic and unpredictable, have motivated the development of self-adaptive software systems. Although noteworthy successes have been achieved on many fronts, the construction of such systems remains significantly more challenging than traditional systems. We argue this is partially because researchers and practitioners have been struggling with the lack of a precise vocabulary for describing and reasoning about the key architectural characteristics of self-adaptive systems. Further exacerbating the situation is the fact that existing frameworks and guidelines do not provide an encompassing perspective of the different types of concerns in this setting. In this article, we present a comprehensive reference model, entitled FOrmal Reference Model for Self-adaptation (FORMS), that targets both issues. FORMS provides rigor in the manner such systems can be described and reasoned about. It consists of a small number of formally specified modeling elements that correspond to the key concerns in the design of self-adaptive software systems, and a set of relationships that guide their composition. We demonstrate FORMS's ability to precisely describe and reason about the architectural characteristics of distributed self-adaptive software systems through its application to several existing systems. FORMS's expressive power gives it a potential for documenting reusable architectural solutions (e.g., architectural patterns) to commonly encountered problems in this area.",

    "abstract": "Designing software systems that have to deal with dynamic operating conditions, such as changing availability of resources and faults that are difficult to predict, is complex. A promising approach to handle such dynamics is self-adaptation that can be realized by a MAPE-K feedback loop (Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute plus Knowledge). To provide evidence that the system goals are satisfied, given the changing conditions, the state of the art advocates the use of formal methods. However, little research has been done on consolidating design knowledge of self-adaptive systems. To support designers, this paper contributes with a set of formally specified MAPE-K templates that encode design expertise for a family of self-adaptive systems. The templates comprise: (1) behavior specification templates for modeling the different components of a MAPE-K feedback loop (based on networks of timed automata), and (2) property specification templates that support verification of the correctness of the adaptation behaviors (based on timed computation tree logic). To demonstrate the reusability of the formal templates, we performed four case studies in which final-year Masters students used the templates to design different self-adaptive systems.",

The challenge for language designers is to devise appropriate abstractions and linguistic primitives to deal with the large dimension of systems and with their need to adapt to the changes of the working environment and to the evolving requirements. We propose a set of programming abstractions that permit us to represent behaviors, knowledge, and aggregations according to specific policies and to support programming context-awareness, self-awareness, and adaptation. Based on these abstractions, we define SCEL (Software Component Ensemble Language), a kernel language whose solid semantic foundations lay also the basis for formal reasoning on autonomic systems behavior.

They are growing in importance, as the stovepipe static methods of securing software systems have been shown to be inadequate for the challenges posed by modern software systems. Self-protection, like other self-* properties, allows the system to adapt to the changing environment through autonomic means without much human intervention, and can thereby be responsive, agile, and cost effective. While existing research has made significant progress towards autonomic and adaptive security, gaps and challenges remain. This article presents a significant extension of our preliminary study in this area. In particular, unlike our preliminary study, here we have followed a systematic literature review process, which has broadened the scope of our study and strengthened the validity of our conclusions.

    "abstract": "The development of self-adaptive software requires the engineering of an adaptation engine that controls the underlying adaptable software by feedback loops. The engine often describes the adaptation by runtime models representing the adaptable software and by activities such as analysis and planning that use these models. To systematically address the interplay between runtime models and adaptation activities, runtime megamodels have been proposed. A runtime megamodel is a specific model capturing runtime models and adaptation activities. In this article, we go one step further and present an executable modeling language for ExecUtable RuntimE MegAmodels (EUREMA) that eases the development of adaptation engines by following a model-driven engineering approach. We provide a domain-specific modeling language and a runtime interpreter for adaptation engines, in particular feedback loops. Megamodels are kept alive at runtime and by interpreting them, they are directly executed to run feedback loops. Additionally, they can be dynamically adjusted to adapt feedback loops. Thus, EUREMA supports development by making feedback loops explicit at a higher level of abstraction and it enables solutions where multiple feedback loops interact or operate on top of each other and self-adaptation co-exists with offline adaptation for evolution.",

    "abstract": "Theoretical modeling of computer virus/worm epidemic dynamics is an important problem that has attracted many studies. However, most existing models are adapted from biological epidemic ones. Although biological epidemic models can certainly be adapted to capture some computer virus spreading scenarios (especially when the so-called homogeneity assumption holds), the problem of computer virus spreading is not well understood because it has many important perspectives that are not necessarily accommodated in the biological epidemic models. In this article, we initiate the study of such a perspective, namely that of adaptive defense against epidemic spreading in arbitrary networks. More specifically, we investigate a nonhomogeneous Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) model where the model parameters may vary with respect to time. In particular, we focus on two scenarios we call semi-adaptive defense and fully adaptive defense, which accommodate implicit and explicit dependency relationships between the model parameters, respectively. In the semi-adaptive defense scenario, the model’s input parameters are given; the defense is semi-adaptive because the adjustment is implicitly dependent upon the outcome of virus spreading. For this scenario, we present a set of sufficient conditions (some are more general or succinct than others) under which the virus spreading will die out; such sufficient conditions are also known as epidemic thresholds in the literature. In the fully adaptive defense scenario, some input parameters are not known (i.e., the aforementioned sufficient conditions are not applicable) but the defender can observe the outcome of virus spreading. For this scenario, we present adaptive control strategies under which the virus spreading will die out or will be contained to a desired level.",

    "abstract": "Recently, we have been witnessing a rapid increase in the use of machine learning techniques in self-adaptive systems. Machine learning has been used for a variety of reasons, ranging from learning a model of the environment of a system during operation to filtering large sets of possible configurations before analyzing them. While a body of work on the use of machine learning in self-adaptive systems exists, there is currently no systematic overview of this area. Such an overview is important for researchers to understand the state of the art and direct future research efforts. This article reports the results of a systematic literature review that aims at providing such an overview. We focus on self-adaptive systems that are based on a traditional Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute (MAPE)-based feedback loop. The research questions are centered on the problems that motivate the use of machine learning in self-adaptive systems, the key engineering aspects of learning in self-adaptation, and open challenges in this area. The search resulted in 6,709 papers, of which 109 were retained for data collection. Analysis of the collected data shows that machine learning is mostly used for updating adaptation rules and policies to improve system qualities, and managing resources to better balance qualities and resources. These problems are primarily solved using supervised and interactive learning with classification, regression, and reinforcement learning as the dominant methods. Surprisingly, unsupervised learning that naturally fits automation is only applied in a small number of studies. Key open challenges in this area include the performance of learning, managing the effects of learning, and dealing with more complex types of goals. From the insights derived from this systematic literature review, we outline an initial design process for applying machine learning in self-adaptive systems that are based on MAPE feedback loops.",

Recently, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), especially the area of large language models, has shown impressive performance in data comprehension and logical reasoning. These capabilities are highly aligned with the functionalities required in SASs, suggesting a strong potential to employ GenAI to enhance SASs. However, the specific benefits and challenges of employing GenAI in SASs remain unclear. Yet, providing a comprehensive understanding of these benefits and challenges is complex due to several reasons: limited publications in the SAS field, the technological and application diversity within SASs, and the rapid evolution of GenAI technologies. To that end, this paper aims to provide researchers and practitioners a comprehensive snapshot that outlines the potential benefits and challenges of employing GenAI’s within SAS. Specifically, we gather, filter, and analyze literature from four distinct research fields and organize them into two main categories to potential benefits: (i) enhancements to the autonomy of SASs centered around the specific functions of the MAPE-K feedback loop, and (ii) improvements in the interaction between humans and SASs within human-on-the-loop settings. From our study, we outline a research roadmap that highlights the challenges of integrating GenAI into SASs. The roadmap starts with outlining key research challenges that need to be tackled to exploit the potential for applying GenAI in the field of SAS. The roadmap concludes with a practical reflection, elaborating on current shortcomings of GenAI and proposing possible mitigation strategies. 1",

    "abstract": "Edge computing places the computational services and resources closer to the user proximity, to reduce latency, and ensure the quality of service and experience. Low latency, context awareness and mobility support are the major contributors to edge-enabled smart systems. Such systems require handling new situations and change on the fly and ensuring the quality of service while only having access to constrained computation and communication resources and operating in mobile, dynamic and ever-changing environments. Hence, adaptation and self-organisation are crucial for such systems to maintain their performance, and operability while accommodating new changes in their environment. This article reviews the current literature in the field of adaptive edge computing systems. We use a widely accepted taxonomy, which describes the important aspects of adaptive behaviour implementation in computing systems. This taxonomy discusses aspects such as adaptation reasons, the various levels an adaptation strategy can be implemented, the time of reaction to a change, categories of adaptation technique and control of the adaptive behaviour. In this article, we discuss how these aspects are addressed in the literature and identify the open research challenges and future direction in adaptive edge computing systems. The results of our analysis show that most of the identified approaches target adaptation at the application level, and only a few focus on middleware, communication infrastructure and context. Adaptations that are required to address the changes in the context, changes caused by users or in the system itself are also less explored. Furthermore, most of the literature has opted for reactive adaptation, although proactive adaptation is essential to maintain the edge computing systems’ performance and interoperability by anticipating the required adaptations on the fly. Additionally, most approaches apply a centralised adaptation control, which does not perfectly fit the mostly decentralised/distributed edge computing settings.",

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of satellite mega-constellations has highlighted the potential of satellite edge computing as a promising solution for mobile multimedia communications. While reinforcement learning has been explored in satellite communication systems, significant challenges remain, including high latency and limited resources. This study addresses these challenges by focusing on the joint optimization of communication, computing, and caching resources in satellite edge computing to support mobile multimedia applications. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem is formulated with the objective of minimizing the total delay experienced by mobile users, subject to multidimensional resource capacity constraints, which is NP-hard and computationally intractable to solve in polynomial time. To address this complexity, we propose a multi-agent federated reinforcement learning (MAFRL) approach as an efficient solution. In this framework, each satellite operates as an autonomous learning agent equipped with an actor-critic network structure. The proposed MAFRL method demonstrates superior performance, achieving lower delays compared to all baseline approaches. It effectively optimizes delay-sensitive mobile multimedia communications by minimizing total delay and improving task offloading ratios. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to introduce a MAFRL-based approach for resource allocation in satellite edge computing, marking a significant contribution to the field.",

In other words, the user should not have to program each device or connect them together to achieve the required functionality. However, although it is possible for a human operator to specify an active space configuration explicitly, the size, sophistication, and dynamic requirements of modern living environment demand that they have autonomous intelligence satisfying the needs of inhabitants without human intervention. This work presents a proposal for AmI fuzzy computing that exploits multiagent systems and fuzzy theory to realize a long-life learning strategy able to generate context-aware-based fuzzy services and actualize them through abstraction techniques in order to maximize the users' comfort and hardware interoperability level. Experimental results show that proposed approach is capable of anticipating user's requirements by automatically generating the most suitable collection of interoperable fuzzy services.",

Specifically, the agents reason about when and how to adapt using only their history of interactions as guidance. We empirically show that, in a wide range of closed, open, static, and dynamic scenarios, the performance of organizations using our method is close (70–90%) to that of an idealized centralized allocation method and is considerably better (10–60%) than the current state-of-the-art decentralized approaches.",

Therefore, in OC, we talk about controlled self-organization . Although the terms self-organization and adaptivity have been discussed for years, we miss a clear definition of self-organization in most publications, which have a technically motivated background. In this article, we briefly summarize the state of the art and suggest a characterization of (controlled) self-organization and adaptivity that is motivated by the main objectives of the OC initiative. We present a system classification of robust, adaptable, and adaptive systems and define a degree of autonomy to be able to quantify how autonomously a system is working. The degree of autonomy distinguishes and measures external control that is exerted directly by the user ( no autonomy ) from internal control of a system which might be fully controlled by an observer/controller architecture that is part of the system ( full autonomy ). The quantitative degree of autonomy provides the basis for characterizing the notion of controlled self-organization. Furthermore, we discuss several alternatives for the design of organic systems.",

This article develops a mathematically well-formulated approach that naturally supports discounting and combining evidence-based trust reports. This article understands an agent Alice's trust in an agent Bob in terms of Alice's certainty in her belief that Bob is trustworthy. Unlike previous approaches, this article formulates certainty in terms of evidence based on a statistical measure defined over a probability distribution of the probability of positive outcomes. This definition supports important mathematical properties ensuring correct results despite conflicting evidence: (1) for a fixed amount of evidence, certainty increases as conflict in the evidence decreases and (2) for a fixed level of conflict, certainty increases as the amount of evidence increases. Moreover, despite a subtle definition of certainty, this work (3) establishes a bijection between evidence and trust spaces, enabling robust combination of trust reports and (4) provides an efficient algorithm for computing this bijection.",

The reason for this is not least due to the advent of computing trends like ubiquitous computing, ambient intelligence, and cyber-physical systems, where systems are usually open for dynamic integration and able to react adaptively to changing situations. Despite being open and adaptive, it is a common requirement for such systems to be safe. However, traditional safety assurance techniques, both state-of-the-practice and state-of-the-art ones, are not sufficient in this context. We have recently developed some initial solution concepts based on conditional safety certificates and corresponding runtime analyses. In this article we show how to operationalize these concepts. To this end, we present in detail how to specify conditional safety certificates, how to transform them into suitable runtime models, and how these models finally support dynamic safety evaluations.",

It is well-known that this problem is NP-hard and hence computationally feasible approaches must develop an approximate solution. Here, we propose a solution via a Stochastic Clustering Auction (SCA) that uses a Markov chain search process along with simulated annealing. This is the first stochastic auction method used in conjunction with global optimization. It is based on stochastic transfer and swap moves between the clusters of tasks assigned to the various robots and considers not only downhill movements, but also uphill movements, which can avoid local minima. A novel feature of this algorithm is that, by tuning the annealing suite and turning the uphill movements on and off, the global team performance after algorithm convergence can slide in the region between the global optimal performance and the performance associated with a random allocation. Extensive numerical experiments are used to evaluate the performance of SCA in terms of costs and computational and communication requirements. For centralized auctioning, the SCA algorithm is compared to fast greedy auction algorithms. Distributed auctioning is then compared with centralized SCA.",

We propose two distributed trust-aware service selection approaches: one based on Bayesian networks and the other on a beta-mixture model.

In such systems, there is decentralized control, competition for resources and an expectation of both intentional and unintentional errors. The “optimal” distribution of resources is then less important than the endurance of the distribution mechanism. Under these circumstances, we propose to model resource allocation as a common-pool resource management problem, and develop a formal characterization of Elinor Ostrom’s socio-economic principles for self-governing institutions. This article applies a method for sociologically inspired computing to give a complete axiomatization of six of Ostrom’s eight principles in the Event Calculus. A testbed is implemented for experimenting with the axiomatization. The experimental results show that these principles support enduring institutions, in terms of longevity and membership, and also provide insight into calibrating the transaction and running costs associated with implementing the principles against the behavioral profile of the institutional membership. We conclude that it is possible to express Ostrom’s principles in logical form and that they are necessary and sufficient conditions for enduring self-organizing electronic institutions to manage sustainable common-pool resources.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the dynamics of computer virus (malware, worm) in cyberspace is an important problem that has attracted a fair amount of attention. Early investigations for this purpose adapted biological epidemic models, and thus inherited the so-called homogeneity assumption that each node is equally connected to others. Later studies relaxed this often unrealistic homogeneity assumption, but still focused on certain power-law networks. Recently, researchers investigated epidemic models in arbitrary networks (i.e., no restrictions on network topology). However, all these models only capture push-based infection, namely that an infectious node always actively attempts to infect its neighboring nodes. Very recently, the concept of pull-based infection was introduced but was not treated rigorously. Along this line of research, the present article investigates push- and pull-based epidemic spreading dynamics in arbitrary networks, using a nonlinear dynamical systems approach. The article advances the state-of-the-art as follows: (1) It presents a more general and powerful sufficient condition (also known as epidemic threshold in the literature) under which the spreading will become stable. (2) It gives both upper and lower bounds on the global mean infection rate, regardless of the stability of the spreading. (3) It offers insights into, among other things, the estimation of the global mean infection rate through localized monitoring of a small constant number of nodes, without knowing the values of the parameters.",

    "abstract": "Sampling rate adaptation is a critical issue in many resource-constrained networked systems, including Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Existing algorithms are primarily employed to detect events such as objects or physical changes at a high, low, or fixed frequency sampling usually adapted by a central unit or a sink, therefore requiring additional resource usage. Additionally, this algorithm potentially makes a network unable to capture a dynamic change or event of interest, which therefore affects monitoring quality. This article studies the problem of a fully autonomous adaptive sampling regarding the presence of a change or event. We propose a novel scheme, termed “event-sensitive adaptive sampling and low-cost monitoring (e-Sampling)” by addressing the problem in two stages, which leads to reduced resource usage (e.g., energy, radio bandwidth). First, e-Sampling provides the embedded algorithm to adaptive sampling that automatically switches between high- and low-frequency intervals to reduce the resource usage, while minimizing false negative detections. Second, by analyzing the frequency content, e-Sampling presents an event identification algorithm suitable for decentralized computing in resource-constrained networks. In the absence of an event, the “uninteresting” data is not transmitted to the sink. Thus, the energy cost is further reduced. e-Sampling can be useful in a broad range of applications. We apply e-Sampling to Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) and Fire Event Monitoring (FEM), which are typical applications of high-frequency events. Evaluation via both simulations and experiments validates the advantages of e-Sampling in low-cost event monitoring, and in effectively expanding the capacity of WSNs for high data rate applications.",

These challenges make fault tolerance an important criterion in workflow scheduling. This article presents an adaptive, just-in-time scheduling algorithm for scientific workflows. This algorithm judiciously uses both spot and on-demand instances to reduce cost and provide fault tolerance.

The challenge is that users’ individual privacy preferences for the same item may conflict, so an approach that simply merges in some way the users’ privacy preferences may provide unsatisfactory results. Previous proposals to deal with the problem were either time-consuming or did not consider compromises to solve these conflicts (e.g., by considering unilaterally imposed approaches only). We propose a negotiation mechanism for users to agree on a compromise for these conflicts. The second challenge we address in this article relates to the exponential complexity of such a negotiation mechanism. To address this, we propose heuristics that reduce the complexity of the negotiation mechanism and show how substantial benefits can be derived from the use of these heuristics through extensive experimental evaluation that compares the performance of the negotiation mechanism with and without these heuristics. Moreover, we show that one such heuristic makes the negotiation mechanism produce results fast enough to be used in actual social media infrastructures with near-optimal results.",

Our simulation-based evaluation of the mechanism demonstrates its effectiveness under a broad variety of market conditions. In particular, we show how it improves on the classical uniform price auction, and we investigate the value of prior knowledge on the execution time of virtual machines for maximizing profit.

When agents self-determine options from which they choose, for instance, their resource consumption and production, while these choices have a collective systemwide impact, optimal decision-making turns into a combinatorial optimization problem known as NP-hard. In such challenging computational problems, centrally managed (deep) learning systems often require personal data with implications on privacy and citizens’ autonomy. This article envisions an alternative unsupervised and decentralized collective learning approach that preserves privacy, autonomy, and participation of multi-agent systems self-organized into a hierarchical tree structure. Remote interactions orchestrate a highly efficient process for decentralized collective learning . This disruptive concept is realized by I-EPOS, the Iterative Economic Planning and Optimized Selections , accompanied by a paradigmatic software artifact. Strikingly, I-EPOS outperforms related algorithms that involve non-local brute-force operations or exchange full information. This article contributes new experimental findings about the influence of network topology and planning on learning efficiency as well as findings on techno-socio-economic tradeoffs and global optimality. Experimental evaluation with real-world data from energy and bike sharing pilots demonstrates the grand potential of collective learning to design ethically and socially responsible participatory sharing economies.",

    "abstract": "Computing systems form the backbone of many areas in our society, from manufacturing to traffic control, healthcare, and financial systems. When software plays a vital role in the design, construction, and operation, these systems are referred to as software-intensive systems. Self-adaptation equips a software-intensive system with a feedback loop that either automates tasks that otherwise need to be performed by human operators or deals with uncertain conditions. Such feedback loops have found their way to a variety of practical applications; typical examples are an elastic cloud to adapt computing resources and automated server management to respond quickly to business needs. To gain insight into the motivations for applying self-adaptation in practice, the problems solved using self-adaptation and how these problems are solved, and the difficulties and risks that industry faces in adopting self-adaptation, we performed a large-scale survey. We received 184 valid responses from practitioners spread over 21 countries. Based on the analysis of the survey data, we provide an empirically grounded overview the of state of the practice in the application of self-adaptation. From that, we derive insights for researchers to check their current research with industrial needs, and for practitioners to compare their current practice in applying self-adaptation. These insights also provide opportunities for applying self-adaptation in practice and pave the way for future industry-research collaborations.",

    "abstract": "Microservice architecture has transformed traditional monolithic applications into lightweight components. Scaling these lightweight microservices is more efficient than scaling servers. However, scaling microservices still faces the challenges resulted from the unexpected spikes or bursts of requests, which are difficult to detect and can degrade performance instantaneously. To address this challenge and ensure the performance of microservice-based applications, we propose a status-aware and elastic scaling framework called StatuScale , which is based on load status detector that can select appropriate elastic scaling strategies for differentiated resource scheduling in vertical scaling. Additionally, StatuScale employs a horizontal scaling controller that utilizes comprehensive evaluation and resource reduction to manage the number of replicas for each microservice. We also present a novel metric named correlation factor to evaluate the resource usage efficiency. Finally, we use Kubernetes, an open-source container orchestration and management platform, and realistic traces from Alibaba to validate our approach. The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed framework can reduce the average response time in the Sock-Shop application by 8.59% to 12.34%, and in the Hotel-Reservation application by 7.30% to 11.97%, decrease service level objective violations, and offer better performance in resource usage compared to baselines.",

The first set of experiments is a pioneering study on the utility of self-assembling robots to address relatively complex scenarios, such as cooperative object transport. The results of our work suggest that the s-bots possess hardware characteristics which facilitate the design of control mechanisms for autonomous self-assembly. The control architecture we developed proved particularly successful in guiding the robots engaged in the cooperative transport task. However, the results also showed that some features of the robots' controllers had a disruptive effect on their performances. The second set of experiments is an attempt to enhance the adaptiveness of our multi-robot system. In particular, we aim to synthesise an integrated (i.e., not-modular) decision-making mechanism which allows the s-bot to autonomously decide whether or not environmental contingencies require self-assembly. The results show that it is possible to synthesize, by using evolutionary computation techniques, artificial neural networks that integrate both the mechanisms for sensory-motor coordination and for decision making required by the robots in the context of self-assembly.",

It is difficult, maybe impossible for a peer to perceive the membership and location of every resource object due to the scalability and openness of a P2P network. In this article, we discuss a fully distributed P2P system where there is no centralized controller. Each peer has to obtain service information from its acquaintance peers and also send its service information to the acquaintance peers. An acquaintance peer of a peer p is a peer about whose service the peer p knows and with which the peer p can directly communicate in an overlay network. Some acquaintance peer might hold obsolete service information and might be faulty. Each peer has to find a more trustworthy one among acquaintance peers. There are many discussions on how to detect peers that hold a target object. However, a peer cannot manipulate an object without being granted access rights (permissions). In addition to detecting what peers hold a target object, we have to find peers granted access rights to manipulate the target object. The trustworthiness of each acquaintance is defined in terms of the satisfiability and ranking factor in this article. The satisfiability of an acquaintance peer shows how much each peer can trust the acquaintance peer through direct communication to not only detect target objects but also obtain their access rights. On the other hand, the ranking factor of an acquaintance peer indicates how much the acquaintance peer is trusted only by trustworthy acquaintance peers which is different from the traditional reputation concept. We evaluate how the trustworthiness of an acquaintance peer is changed through interactions among peers in a detection algorithm.",

Existing representative checkpoint selection strategies often select some unnecessary checkpoints and omit some necessary ones because they cannot adapt to the dynamics and uncertainty of runtime activity completion duration. In this article, based on the dynamics and uncertainty of runtime activity completion duration, we develop a novel checkpoint selection strategy that can adaptively select not only necessary, but also sufficient checkpoints. Specifically, we introduce a new concept of minimum time redundancy as a key reference parameter for checkpoint selection. An important feature of minimum time redundancy is that it can adapt to the dynamics and uncertainty of runtime activity completion duration. We develop a method on how to achieve minimum time redundancy dynamically along grid workflow execution and investigate its relationships with temporal consistency. Based on the method and the relationships, we present our strategy and rigorously prove its necessity and sufficiency. The simulation evaluation further demonstrates experimentally such necessity and sufficiency and its significant improvement on checkpoint selection over other representative strategies.",

This problem is often illustrated by the gathering problem, where the robots must self-organize and meet at some location not determined in advance, and without the help of some global coordinate system. While very simple to express, this problem has the advantage of retaining the inherent difficulty of agreement, namely the question of breaking symmetry between robots. In previous works, it has been proved that the gathering problem is solvable in asynchronous model with oblivious (i.e., memory-less) robots and limited visibility, as long as the robots share the knowledge of some direction, as provided by a compass. However, the problem has no solution in the semi-synchronous model when robots do not share a compass, or when they cannot detect multiplicity. In this article, we define a model in which compasses may be unreliable, and study the solvability of gathering oblivious mobile robots with limited visibility in the semi-synchronous model. In particular, we give an algorithm that solves the problem in finite time in a system where compasses are unstable for some arbitrary long periods, provided that they stabilize eventually. In addition, we show that our algorithm solves the gathering problem for at most three robots in the asynchronous model. Our algorithm is intrinsically self-stabilizing.",

However, the performance after introducing mutation can be affected in many aspects and the parameters used to perform mutations are very hard to determine. For the purpose of developing efficient mutation operators, this article proposes a unified tabu and mutation framework with parameter adaptations in the context of the Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO). The proposed framework is a significant extension of our preliminary work [Wang et al. 2007]. Empirical studies on 25 benchmark functions indicate that under the proposed framework: (1) excellent performance can be achieved even with a small number of mutations; (2) the derived algorithm consistently performs well on diverse types of problems and overall performance even surpasses the state-of-the-art PSO variants and representative mutation-based EAs; and (3) fast convergence rates can be preserved despite the use of a long jump mutation operator (the Cauchy mutation).",

Traditionally, robot swarms have been developed using a code-and-fix approach: in a bottom-up iterative process, the developer tests and improves the individual behaviors of the robots until the desired collective behavior is obtained. The code-and-fix approach is unstructured, and the quality of the obtained swarm depends completely on the expertise and ingenuity of the developer who has little scientific or technical support in his activity. Property-driven design aims at providing such scientific and technical support, with many advantages compared to the traditional unstructured approach. Property-driven design is composed of four phases: first, the developer formally specifies the requirements of the robot swarm by stating its desired properties; second, the developer creates a prescriptive model of the swarm and uses model checking to verify that this prescriptive model satisfies the desired properties; third, using the prescriptive model as a blueprint, the developer implements a simulated version of the desired robot swarm and validates the prescriptive model developed in the previous step; fourth, the developer implements the desired robot swarm and validates the previous steps. We demonstrate property-driven design using two case studies: aggregation and foraging.",

Such systems often operate in environments that are continuously evolving and where agents’ actions are non-deterministic, so called inherently non-stationary environments. When there are inconsistent results for agents acting on such an environment, learning and adapting is challenging. In this article, we propose P-MARL, an approach that integrates prediction and pattern change detection abilities into MARL and thus minimises the effect of non-stationarity in the environment. The environment is modelled as a time-series, with future estimates provided using prediction techniques. Learning is based on the predicted environment behaviour, with agents employing this knowledge to improve their performance in realtime. We illustrate P-MARL’s performance in a real-world smart grid scenario, where the environment is heavily influenced by non-stationary power demand patterns from residential consumers. We evaluate P-MARL in three different situations, where agents’ action decisions are independent, simultaneous, and sequential. Results show that all methods outperform traditional MARL, with sequential P-MARL achieving best results.",

Scheduling algorithms are crucial in enabling the efficient automation of these large-scale workflows, and considerable effort has been made to develop novel heuristics tailored for the cloud resource model. The majority of these algorithms focus on coarse-grained billing periods that are much larger than the average execution time of individual tasks. Instead, our work focuses on emerging finer-grained pricing schemes (e.g., per-minute billing) that provide users with more flexibility and the ability to reduce the inherent wastage that results from coarser-grained ones. We propose a scheduling algorithm whose objective is to optimize a workflow’s execution time under a budget constraint; quality of service requirement that has been overlooked in favor of optimizing cost under a deadline constraint. Our proposal addresses fundamental challenges of clouds such as resource elasticity, abundance, and heterogeneity, as well as resource performance variation and virtual machine provisioning delays. The simulation results demonstrate our algorithm’s responsiveness to environmental uncertainties and its ability to generate high-quality schedules that comply with the budget constraint while achieving faster execution times when compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.",

    "abstract": "One of the primary drivers for self-adaptation is ensuring that systems achieve their goals regardless of the uncertainties they face during operation. Nevertheless, the concept of uncertainty in self-adaptive systems is still insufficiently understood. Several taxonomies of uncertainty have been proposed, and a substantial body of work exists on methods to tame uncertainty. Yet, these taxonomies and methods do not fully convey the research community’s perception on what constitutes uncertainty in self-adaptive systems and on the key characteristics of the approaches needed to tackle uncertainty. To understand this perception and learn from it, we conducted a survey comprising two complementary stages in which we collected the views of 54 and 51 participants, respectively. In the first stage, we focused on current research and development, exploring how the concept of uncertainty is understood in the community and how uncertainty is currently handled in the engineering of self-adaptive systems. In the second stage, we focused on directions for future research to identify potential approaches to dealing with unanticipated changes and other open challenges in handling uncertainty in self-adaptive systems. The key findings of the first stage are: (a) an overview of uncertainty sources considered in self-adaptive systems, (b) an overview of existing methods used to tackle uncertainty in concrete applications, (c) insights into the impact of uncertainty on non-functional requirements, (d) insights into different opinions in the perception of uncertainty within the community and the need for standardised uncertainty-handling processes to facilitate uncertainty management in self-adaptive systems. The key findings of the second stage are: (a) the insight that over 70% of the participants believe that self-adaptive systems can be engineered to cope with unanticipated change, (b) a set of potential approaches for dealing with unanticipated change, (c) a set of open challenges in mitigating uncertainty in self-adaptive systems, in particular in those with safety-critical requirements. From these findings, we outline an initial reference process to manage uncertainty in self-adaptive systems. We anticipate that the insights on uncertainty obtained from the community and our proposed reference process will inspire valuable future research on self-adaptive systems.",

    "abstract": "Modern information technology services largely depend on cloud infrastructures to provide their services. These cloud infrastructures are built on top of Datacenter Networks (DCNs) constructed with high-speed links, fast switching gear, and redundancy to offer better flexibility and resiliency. In this environment, network traffic includes long-lived (elephant) and short-lived (mice) flows with partitioned/aggregated traffic patterns. Although SDN-based approaches can efficiently allocate networking resources for such flows, the overhead due to network reconfiguration can be significant. With limited capacity of Ternary Content-Addressable Memory (TCAM) deployed in an OpenFlow enabled switch, it is crucial to determine which forwarding rules should remain in the flow table and which rules should be processed by the SDN controller in case of a table-miss on the SDN switch. This is needed in order to obtain the flow entries that satisfy the goal of reducing the long-term control plane overhead introduced between the controller and the switches. To achieve this goal, we propose a machine learning technique that utilizes two variations of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms—the first of which is a traditional RL-based algorithm, while the other is deep reinforcement learning-based. Emulation results using the RL algorithm show around 60% improvement in reducing the long-term control plane overhead and around 14% improvement in the table-hit ratio compared to the Multiple Bloom Filters (MBF) method, given a fixed size flow table of 4KB.",

To make this possible, autonomous agents will require the ability to embed practical models of human behavior, allowing them not only to replicate human models as a technique to “learn” but also to understand the actions of users and anticipate their behavior, so as to truly operate in symbiosis with them. The main objective of this article is to provide a succinct yet systematic review of important approaches in two areas dealing with quantitative models of human behaviors. Specifically, we focus on (i) techniques that learn a model or policy of behavior through exploration and feedback, such as Reinforcement Learning, and (ii) directly model mechanisms of human reasoning, such as beliefs and bias, without necessarily learning via trial and error.",

    "abstract": "The Human Machine Teaming (HMT) paradigm focuses on supporting partnerships between humans and autonomous machines. HMT describes requirements for transparency, augmented cognition, and coordination that enable far richer partnerships than those found in typical human-on-the-loop and human-in-the-loop systems. Autonomous, self-adaptive systems in domains such as autonomous driving, robotics, and Cyber-Physical Systems, are often implemented using the MAPE-K feedback loop as the primary reference model. However, while MAPE-K enables fully autonomous behavior, it does not explicitly address the interactions that occur between humans and autonomous machines as intended by HMT. In this article, we, therefore, present the MAPE-K HMT framework, which utilizes runtime models to augment the monitoring, analysis, planning, and execution phases of the MAPE-K loop to support HMT despite the different operational cadences of humans and machines. We draw on examples from our own emergency response system of interactive, autonomous, small unmanned aerial systems to illustrate the application of MAPE-K HMT in both a simulated and physical environment, and we discuss how the various HMT models are connected and can be integrated into a MAPE-K solution.",

    "abstract": "Edge computing provides resources for IoT workloads at the network edge. Monitoring systems are vital for efficiently managing resources and application workloads by collecting, storing, and providing relevant information about the state of the resources. However, traditional monitoring systems have a centralized architecture for both data plane and control plane, which increases latency, creates a failure bottleneck, and faces challenges in providing quick and trustworthy data in volatile edge environments, especially where infrastructures are often built upon failure-prone, unsophisticated computing and network resources. Thus, we propose DEMon, a decentralized, self-adaptive monitoring system for edge. DEMon leverages the stochastic gossip communication protocol at its core. It develops efficient protocols for information dissemination, communication, and retrieval, avoiding a single point of failure and ensuring fast and trustworthy data access. Its decentralized control enables self-adaptive management of monitoring parameters, addressing the trade-offs between the quality of service of monitoring and resource consumption. We implement the proposed system as a lightweight and portable container-based system and evaluate it through experiments. We also present a use case demonstrating its feasibility. The results show that DEMon efficiently disseminates and retrieves the monitoring information, addressing the challenges of edge monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Voice over IP (VoIP) is a key enabling technology for migration of circuit-switched PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) architectures to packet-based networks. One problem of the present VoIP networks is filtering spam calls referred to as SPIT (Spam over Internet Telephony). Unlike spam in e-mail systems, VoIP spam calls have to be identified in real time. Many of the techniques devised for e-mail spam detection rely upon content analysis, and in the case of VoIP, it is too late to analyze the content (voice) as the user would have already attended the call. Therefore, the real challenge is to block a spam call before the telephone rings. In addition, we believe it is imperative that spam filters integrate human behavioral aspects to gauge the legitimacy of voice calls. We know that, when it comes to receiving or rejecting a voice call, people use the social meaning of trust, reputation, friendship of the calling party and their own mood. In this article, we describe a multi-stage, adaptive spam filter based on presence (location, mood, time), trust, and reputation to detect spam in voice calls. In particular, we describe a closed-loop feedback control between different stages to decide whether an incoming call is spam. We further propose formalism for voice-specific trust and reputation analysis. We base this formal model on a human intuitive behavior for detecting spam based on the called party's direct and indirect relationships with the calling party. No VoIP corpus is available for testing the detection mechanism. Therefore, for verifying the detection accuracy, we used a laboratory setup of several soft-phones, real IP phones and a commercial-grade proxy server that receives and processes incoming calls. We experimentally validated the proposed filtering mechanisms by simulating spam calls and measured the filter's accuracy by applying the trust and reputation formalism. We observed that, while the filter blocks a second spam call from a spammer calling from the same end IP host and domain, the filter needs only a maximum of three calls---even in the case when spammer moves to a new host and domain. Finally, we present a detailed sensitivity analysis for examining the influence of parameters such as spam volume and network size on the filter's accuracy.",

This has left many researchers confused as to what constitutes a self-organizing distributed system and without a vocabulary with which to discuss aspects of these systems. This article introduces an agent-based model of self-organizing MANET and P2P systems and shows how it is realised in three existing network systems. The model is based on concepts such as partial views, evaluation functions, system utility, feedback and decay. We review the three network systems, AntHocNet, SAMPLE, and Freenet, and show how they can achieve high scalability, robustness and adaptability to unpredictable changes in their environment, by using self-organizing mechanisms similar to those found in nature. They are designed to improve their operation in a dynamic, heterogeneous environment, enabling them to often demonstrate superior performance to state of the art distributed systems. This article is also addressed at researchers interested in gaining a general understanding of different mechanisms and properties of self-organization in distributed systems.",

Most autonomous systems use Automated Facial Expression Classification (AFEC) and Automated Affect Interpretation (AAI) to achieve sociability. Varying lighting conditions, occlusion, and control over physiognomy can influence the real life performance of vision-based AFEC systems. Physiological signals provide complementary information for AFEC and AAI. We employed transient facial thermal features for AFEC and AAI. Infrared thermal images with participants' normal expression and intentional expressions of happiness, sadness, disgust, and fear were captured. Facial points that undergo significant thermal changes with a change in expression termed as Facial Thermal Feature Points (FTFPs) were identified. Discriminant analysis was invoked on principal components derived from the Thermal Intensity Values (TIVs) recorded at the FTFPs. The cross-validation and person-independent classification respectively resulted in 66.28% and 56.0% success rates. Classification significance tests suggest that (1) like other physiological cues, facial skin temperature also provides useful information about affective states and their facial expression; (2) patterns of facial skin temperature variation can complement other cues for AFEC and AAI; and (3) infrared thermal imaging may help achieve artificial sociability in robots and autonomous systems.",

In fact, Grid computing and multi-agent systems research have similar objectives. They both aim to achieve “large-scale open distributed systems, capable of being able to effectively and dynamically deploy and redeploy computational (and other) resources as required, to solve computationally complex problems” [Foster and Kesselman 2003]. On the one hand, service-oriented Grid architectures need to support dynamic cooperation, negotiation, and adaptive interactions between Web services controlling Grid resources for efficient resource and task allocation and execution. On the other hand, the Grid can facilitate agent communication, life-cycle management, and access to resources for agents. Although the relevance of Grid for agent research and vice versa has been identified in several forums, actual collaborative applications are still in their infancy. In this article, we discuss our recent work on deploying multi-agent negotiation techniques to facilitate dynamic negotiation for Grid resources as a step closer to an adaptive and autonomous Grid. In particular, we describe a Web service development of the Contract Net Protocol for negotiation between insurance companies and repair companies. We evaluate our approach to show the added value of negotiable interactions between Web services as opposed to inflexible single-shot interactions that are currently the state of the art.",

Current IDS have two main problems: The first problem is that typically so many alarms are generated as to overwhelm the system operator, many of these being false alarms. The second problem is that continuous tuning of the intrusion detection model is required in order to maintain sufficient performance due to the dynamically changing nature of the monitored system. This manual tuning process relies on the system operators to work out the updated tuning solution and to integrate it into the detection model. In this article, we present an automatically tuning intrusion detection system, which controls the number of alarms output to the system operator and tunes the detection model on the fly according to feedback provided by the system operator when false predictions are identified. This system adapts its behavior (i) by throttling the volume of alarms output to the operator in response to the ability of the operator to respond to these alarms, and (ii) by deciding how aggressively the detection model should be tuned based on the accuracy of earlier predictions. We evaluated our system using the KDDCup'99 intrusion detection dataset. Our results show that an adaptive, automatically tuning intrustion detection system will be both practical and efficient.",

    "abstract": "Predicting future calls can be the next advanced feature of the next-generation telecommunication networks as the service providers are looking to offer new services to their customers. Call prediction can be useful to many applications such as planning daily schedules, avoiding unwanted communications (e.g. voice spam), and resource planning in call centers. Predicting calls is a very challenging task. We believe that this is an emerging area of research in ambient intelligence where the electronic devices are sensitive and responsive to people's needs and behavior. In particular, we believe that the results of this research will lead to higher productivity and quality of life. In this article, we present a Call Predictor (CP) that offers two new advanced features for the next-generation phones namely “Incoming Call Forecast” and “Intelligent Address Book.” For the Incoming Call Forecast, the CP makes the next-24-hour incoming call prediction based on recent caller's behavior and reciprocity. For the Intelligent Address Book, the CP generates a list of most likely contacts/numbers to be dialed at any given time based on the user's behavior and reciprocity. The CP consists of two major components: Probability Estimator (PE) and Trend Detector (TD). The PE computes the probability of receiving/initiating a call based on the caller/user's calling behavior and reciprocity. We show that the recent trend of the caller/user's calling pattern has higher correlation to the future pattern than the pattern derived from the entire historical data. The TD detects the recent trend of the caller/user's calling pattern and computes the adequacy of historical data in terms of reversed time (time that runs towards the past) based on a trace distance. The recent behavior detection mechanism allows CP to adapt its computation in response to the new calling behaviors. Therefore, CP is adaptive to the recent behavior. For our analysis, we use the real-life call logs of 94 mobile phone users over nine months, which were collected by the Reality Mining Project group at MIT. The performance of the CP is validated for two months based on seven months of training data. The experimental results show that the CP performs reasonably well as an incoming call predictor (Incoming Call Forecast) with false positive rate of 8%, false negative rate of 1%, and error rate of 9%, and as an outgoing call predictor (Intelligent Address Book) with the accuracy of 70% when the list has five entries. The functionality of the CP can be useful in assisting its user in carrying out everyday life activities such as scheduling daily plans by using the Incoming Call Forecast, and saving time from searching for the phone number in a typically lengthy contact book by using the Intelligent Address Book. Furthermore, we describe other useful applications of CP besides its own aforementioned features including Call Firewall and Call Reminder.",

    "abstract": "One of the major challenges in engineering distributed multiagent systems is the coordination necessary to align the behavior of different agents. Decentralization of control implies a style of coordination in which the agents cooperate as peers with respect to each other and no agent has global control over the system, or global knowledge about the system. The dynamic interactions and collaborations among agents are usually structured and managed by means of roles and organizations. In existing approaches agents typically have a dual responsibility: on the one hand playing roles within the organization, on the other hand managing the life-cycle of the organization itself, for example, setting up the organization and managing organization dynamics. Engineering realistic multiagent systems in which agents encapsulate this dual responsibility is a complex task. In this article, we present a middleware for context-driven dynamic agent organizations. The middleware is part of an integrated approach, called MACODO: Middleware Architecture for COntext-driven Dynamic agent Organizations. The complementary part of the MACODO approach is an organization model that defines abstractions to support application developers in describing dynamic organizations, as described in Weyns et al. [2010]. The MACODO middleware offers the life-cycle management of dynamic organizations as a reusable service separated from the agents, which makes it easier to understand, design, and manage dynamic organizations in multiagent systems. We give a detailed description of the software architecture of the MADOCO middleware. The software architecture describes the essential building blocks of a distributed middleware platform that supports the MACODO organization model. We used the middleware architecture to develop a prototype middleware platform for a traffic monitoring application. We evaluate the MACODO middeware architecture by assessing the adaptability, scalability, and robustness of the prototype platform.",

In this article, we identify a new property of distributed algorithms, eventual consistency , which guarantees that computation converges to a final state that approximates a predictable limit, based on the continuous environment, as the density and speed of devices increases. We then identify a large class of programs that are eventually consistent, building on prior results on the field calculus computational model (Beal et al. 2015; Viroli et al. 2015a) that identify a class of self-stabilizing programs. Finally, we confirm through simulation of IoT application scenarios that eventually consistent programs from this class can provide resilient behavior where programs that are only converging fail badly.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we complement Elinor Ostrom’s institutional design principles for enduring common-pool resource management with Nicholas Rescher’s theory of distributive justice based on the canon of legitimate claims. Two of Ostrom’s principles are that the resource allocation method should be congruent with the local environment, and that those affected by the allocation method (the appropriators) should participate in its selection. However, these principles do not say anything explicitly about the fairness of the allocation method or the outcomes it produces: for this, we need a mechanism for distributive justice. Rescher identified a number of different mechanisms, each of which had both its merits and demerits, and instead maintained that distributive justice consisted in identifying the legitimate claims in context, accommodating multiple claims in case of plurality, and reconciling them in case of conflict. Accordingly, we specify a logical axiomatisation of the principles with the canon of legitimate claims, whereby a set of claims is each represented as a voting function, which collectively determine the rank order in which resources are allocated. The appropriators vote on the weight attached to the scoring functions, and so self-organise the allocation method, taking into account both the plurality of and conflict between the claims. Therefore, the appropriators exercise collective choice over the method, and the method itself is congruent with the local environment, taking into account both the resources available and the relative claims of the appropriators. Experiments with a variant of the linear public good game show that this pluralistic self-organising approach produces a better balance of utility and fairness (for agents that comply with the rules of the game) compared to monistic or fixed approaches, provide “fairness over time” (a series of ostensibly unfair individual allocations is revealed to be cumulatively fair), and offer an intuition of how to resolve the free-rider phenomenon in provision and appropriation of common-pool resources.",

Resource management is an important and challenging task, especially for multitier applications with unpredictable time-varying workloads. Work in resource management using control theory has shown clear benefits of dynamically adjusting resource allocations to match fluctuating workloads. However, little work has been done toward adaptive controllers for unknown workload types. This work presents a new resource management scheme that incorporates the Kalman filter into feedback controllers to dynamically allocate CPU resources to virtual machines hosting server applications. We present a set of controllers that continuously detect and self-adapt to unforeseen workload changes. Furthermore, our most advanced controller also self-configures itself without any a priori information and with a small 4.8% performance penalty in the case of high-intensity workload changes. In addition, our controllers are enhanced to deal with multitier server applications: by using the pair-wise resource coupling between tiers, they improve server response to large workload increases as compared to controllers with no such resource-coupling mechanism. Our approaches are evaluated and their performance is illustrated on a 3-tier Rubis benchmark website deployed on a prototype Xen-virtualized cluster.",

Service composition, which provides a cost-effective way to implement software systems, has attracted significant attention from both industry and research communities. As online services may keep evolving over time and thus lead to a highly dynamic environment, service composition must be self-adaptive to tackle uninformed behavior during the evolution of services. In addition, service composition should also maintain high efficiency for large-scale services, which are common for enterprise applications. This article presents a new model for large-scale adaptive service composition based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. The model integrates reinforcement learning and game theory, where the former is to achieve adaptation in a highly dynamic environment and the latter is to enable agents to work for a common task (i.e., composition). In particular, we propose a multi-agent Q-learning algorithm for service composition, which is expected to achieve better performance when compared with the single-agent Q-learning method and multi-agent SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) method.

Another paradigm that is gaining steam is gamification, i.e., incentivizing users to fix the system by influencing their behavior with rewards and prizes. In this work, we combine the two efforts and show that a joint optimization considering both rebalancing and incentives results in a higher service quality for a lower cost than using simple rebalancing.

In reactive approaches, adaptations are chosen and executed after some issue in the system has been detected (e.g., unforeseen attacks or failures). In proactive approaches, predictions are used to prepare the system for some future event (e.g., traffic spikes during holidays). In both cases, the choice of adaptation is based on the estimated impact it will have on the system. Current decision-making approaches assume that the impact will be instantaneous, whereas it is common that adaptations take time to produce their impact. Ignoring this latency is problematic because adaptations may not achieve their effect in time for a predicted event. Furthermore, lower impact but quicker adaptations may be ignored altogether, even if over time the accrued impact is actually higher. In this article, we introduce a novel approach to choosing adaptations that considers these latencies. To show how this improves adaptation decisions, we use a two-pronged approach: (i) model checking of Stochastic Multiplayer Games (SMGs) enables us to understand best- and worst-case scenarios of optimal latency-aware and non-latency-aware adaptation without the need to develop specific adaptation algorithms. However, since SMGs do not provide an algorithm to make choices at runtime, we propose a (ii) latency-aware adaptation algorithm to make decisions at runtime. Simulations are used to explore more detailed adaptation behavior and to check if the performance of the algorithm falls within the bounds predicted by SMGs. Our results show that latency awareness improves adaptation outcomes and also allows a larger set of adaptations to be exploited.",

    "abstract": "Proactive latency-aware adaptation is an approach for self-adaptive systems that considers both the current and anticipated adaptation needs when making adaptation decisions, taking into account the latency of the available adaptation tactics. Since this is a problem of selecting adaptation actions in the context of the probabilistic behavior of the environment, Markov decision processes (MDPs) are a suitable approach. However, given all the possible interactions between the different and possibly concurrent adaptation tactics, the system, and the environment, constructing the MDP is a complex task. Probabilistic model checking has been used to deal with this problem, but it requires constructing the MDP every time an adaptation decision is made to incorporate the latest predictions of the environment behavior. In this article, we describe PLA-SDP, an approach that eliminates that runtime overhead by constructing most of the MDP offline. At runtime, the adaptation decision is made by solving the MDP through stochastic dynamic programming, weaving in the environment model as the solution is computed. We also present extensions that support different notions of utility, such as maximizing reward gain subject to the satisfaction of a probabilistic constraint, making PLA-SDP applicable to systems with different kinds of adaptation goals.",

The basic idea was inspired by swarms of fireflies, whose flashing dynamics shows an emergent behavior. This article introduces such a synchronization technique whose main components are “inhibitory coupling” and “self-adjustment.” Based on this new technique, a number of contributions are made. First, we prove that inhibitory coupling can lead to perfect synchrony independent of initial conditions for delay-free environments and homogeneous oscillators. Second, relaxing the assumptions to systems with delays and different phase rates, we prove that such systems synchronize up to a certain precision bound. We derive this bound assuming inhomogeneous delays and show by simulations that it gives a good estimate in strongly-coupled systems. Third, we show that inhibitory coupling with self-adjustment quickly leads to synchrony with a precision comparable to that of excitatory coupling. Fourth, we analyze the robustness against faulty members performing incorrect coupling. While the specific precision-loss encountered by such disturbances depends on system parameters, the system always regains synchrony for the investigated scenarios.",

These applications include many large-scale distributed problems, including the optimal storage of large sets of graph-structured data over several hosts. However, in very large-scale distributed scenarios, state-of-the-art algorithms are not directly applicable because they typically involve frequent global operations over the entire graph. In this article, we propose a fully distributed algorithm called J A - BE -J A that uses local search and simulated annealing techniques for two types of graph partitioning: edge-cut partitioning and vertex-cut partitioning. The algorithm is massively parallel: There is no central coordination, each vertex is processed independently, and only the direct neighbors of a vertex and a small subset of random vertices in the graph need to be known locally. Strict synchronization is not required. These features allow J A - BE -J A to be easily adapted to any distributed graph-processing system from data centers to fully distributed networks. We show that the minimal edge-cut value empirically achieved by J A - BE -J A is comparable to state-of-the-art centralized algorithms such as Metis. In particular, on large social networks, J A - BE -J A outperforms Metis. We also show that J A - BE -J A computes very low vertex-cuts, which are proved significantly more effective than edge-cuts for processing most real-world graphs.",

The article introduces new techniques that address these challenges. The first challenge is addressed by optimizing, in a decentralized way, the placement of the objects generating the largest number of remote operations for each node. The second challenge is addressed by combining the usage of consistent hashing with a novel data structure, which provides efficient probabilistic data placement. These techniques have been integrated in a popular open-source key-value store.

Using realistic workload traces and renewable energy data, we show that GreenWorks could provide a near-optimal workload performance (within 3% difference) on average. It can also reduce the worst-case performance degradation by 43% compared to the state-of-the-art design. Moreover, the performance improvements are based on carbon-neutral operations and are not at the cost of significant efficiency degradation and reduced battery lifecycle.

However, existing PPDL solutions depend on intricate protocol designs for robust security. Although leveraging advanced dedicated hardware platforms can significantly improve inference efficiency, the PPDL frameworks that make the best use of hardware platform computility are scarce. Thus, balancing efficiency and security in PPDL remains an open question. This study presents SEPPDL, a secure tripartite inference framework for deep learning based on secret-sharing to balance privacy security and computational efficiency. We reduce the communication and calculation time by designing a deep learning quantisation representation scheme, two new computational protocols, and a computation library that utilises the integer computation units of the GPU. The experimental results show that compared with state-of-the-art PPDL frameworks, the SEPPDL framework reduces the communication and computation delay in the model inference to 1/2 and 1/3 of the existing optimal frameworks while maintaining the accuracy of the model inference. Meanwhile, the SEPPDL framework achieves a 10-fold performance improvement in a lightweight model. As the model scale increases, the performance of the SEPPDL-based model even achieves an 86-fold improvement compared to VGG16.",

    "abstract": "The Web 3.0 and metaverse can empower intelligent application of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). The adoption of edge computing can contribute to the low latency interaction between CAVs and the metaverse. Microservices are widely deployed on edge networks and the cloud nowadays. User's requests from CAVs are typically fulfilled through the composition of microservices, which may be hosted by contiguous edge nodes. Requests may differ on their required resources at runtime. Consequently, when requests are continuously injected into edge networks, the usage of heterogenous resources, including CPU, memory, and network bandwidth, may not be the same, or differ significantly, on certain edge nodes. This happens especially when burst requests are injected into the network to be satisfied concurrently. Therefore, the usage of heterogenous resources provided by edge nodes should be co-optimized through re-scheduling microservices. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a Web 3.0-enabled M icroservice R e- S cheduling approach (called MRS ), which is a migration-based mechanism integrating a placement strategy. Specifically, we formulate the microservice re-scheduling task as a multi-objective and multi-constraint optimization problem, which can be solved through a penalty signal-integrated framework and an improved pointer network. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets. Evaluation results show that our MRS performs better than the counterparts with improvements of at least 7.7%, 2.4% and 2.2% in terms of network throughput, latency and energy consumption.",

    "abstract": "Task offloading is recognized as a promising approach to enhance the computational performance of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Some applications of CAVs, such as metaverse applications, require substantial resources, posing significant challenges to CAVs with limited computing and storage capacities. CAVs can offload resource-intensive applications to the vehicular edge computing (VEC) server, which has strong computing capabilities. To fully utilize the resources in the CAV system, partial offloading is employed. However, the local computing resources are limited for continuously generated partial offloading tasks. This results in many partially locally executed tasks experiencing long processing times or being discarded, which is detrimental to delay-sensitive tasks on CAVs. This paper proposes Lyapunov function guided reinforcement learning for the CAVs task offloading computational framework, LyDRL. Specifically, LyDRL first uses the Lyapunov function to transform the long-term objective optimization problem into subproblems determined at each time slot. In each time slot, deep reinforcement learning is used to obtain the optimal task offloading decision while satisfying the constraints. Simulation results show that compared with existing algorithms, the proposed strategy can ensure the stability of the CAVs system and achieve the lowest system overhead.",

Ensuring they safely handle harmful inputs is crucial before formal deployment. However, research reveals emerging hand-crafted jailbreak attacks, which pack harmful prompts into harmless instructions, can bypass LLMs’ security mechanisms and elicit harmful responses. To deeply understand such jailbreaks, this paper introduces a Compositional Instruction Attack (CIA) framework to generalize them, and develop two CIA jailbreaking methods to automatically generate tailored jailbreak prompts for each harmful prompt. Then, this paper builds the first CIA question-answering (CIAQA) dataset with 2.7K multiple-choice questions of 900 successful jailbreaks, for assessing LLMs’ ability to identify underlying harmful intents, harmfulness, and task priority in CIA jailbreaks. Combined with experimental analysis on CIAQA and other datasets, this paper concludes three possible reasons for the failure of LLM defenses against CIAs. Finally, we propose an intent-based defense paradigm (IBD), enabling LLMs to defend against CIA by leveraging its capability to identify intents. Experimental results show CIA can achieve attack success rates (ASR) of 95%+ and 85%+ in AD and common harmful scenarios for three well-known LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and Llama2-70b-chat), and IBD reduces ASR by 74%+.",

Manufacturers tend to collaborate through ecosystem partnerships to jointly advance the development of autonomous driving algorithms such as Huawei has established partnerships with multiple collaborators sharing intelligent automotive solutions. However, concerns about data privacy naturally arise among automobile manufacturers. This paper proposes a privacy-preserving framework, EPAuto, for collaborative machine learning among automobile manufacturers. EPAuto leverages secure multi-party computation (MPC) to enable efficient privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML).

We implement our protocols within 2 to 120 parties in both LAN and WAN environments. Our results demonstrate nanosecond-level online response over LAN in multi-party settings, and our PPML implementations achieve up to a 907× performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art works in the same setting.",

Our previous work proposed P arley , a more nuanced, adaptive approach to SAS uncertainty reduction.

We illustrate the use and extend the evaluation of the effectiveness of our approach for mobile robot navigation and service-based system SAS.

    "abstract": "Today's distributed applications such as sensor networks, mobile multimedia applications, and intelligent transportation systems pose huge engineering challenges. Such systems often comprise different components that interact with each other as peers, as such forming a decentralized system. The system components and collaborations change over time, often in unanticipated ways. Multiagent systems belong to a class of decentralized systems that are known for realizing qualities such as adaptability, robustness, and scalability in such environments. A typical way to structure and manage interactions among agents is by means of organizations. Existing approaches usually endow agents with a dual responsibility: on the one hand agents have to play roles providing the associated functionality in the organization, on the other hand agents are responsible for setting up organizations and managing organization dynamics. Engineering realistic multiagent systems in which agents encapsulate this dual responsibility is a complex task. In this article, we present an organization model for context-driven dynamic agent organizations. The model defines abstractions that support application developers to describe dynamic organizations. The organization model is part of an integrated approach, called MACODO: Middleware Architecture for COntext-driven Dynamic agent Organizations. The complementary part of the MACODO approach is a middleware platform that supports the distributed execution of dynamic organizations specified using the abstractions, as described in Weyns et al. [2009]. In the model, the life-cycle management of dynamic organizations is separated from the agents: organizations are first-class citizens, and their dynamics are governed by laws. The laws specify how changes in the system (e.g., an agent joins an organization) and changes in the context (e.g., information observed in the environment) lead to dynamic reorganizations. As such, the model makes it easier to understand and specify dynamic organizations in multiagent systems, and promotes reusing the life-cycle management of dynamic organizations. The organization model is formally described to specify the semantics of the abstractions, and ensure its type safety. We apply the organization model to specify dynamic organizations for a traffic monitoring application.",

    "abstract": "Autonomic server provisioning for performance assurance is a critical issue in Internet services. It is challenging to guarantee that requests flowing through a multi-tier system will experience an acceptable distribution of delays. The difficulty is mainly due to highly dynamic workloads, the complexity of underlying computer systems, and the lack of accurate performance models. We propose a novel autonomic server provisioning approach based on a model-independent self-adaptive Neural Fuzzy Control (NFC). Existing model-independent fuzzy controllers are designed manually on a trial-and-error basis, and are often ineffective in the face of highly dynamic workloads. NFC is a hybrid of control-theoretical and machine learning techniques. It is capable of self-constructing its structure and adapting its parameters through fast online learning. We further enhance NFC to compensate for the effect of server switching delays. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, compared to a rule-based fuzzy controller and a Proportional-Integral controller, the NFC-based approach delivers superior performance assurance in the face of highly dynamic workloads. It is robust to variation in workload intensity, characteristics, delay target, and server switching delays. We demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the NFC-based approach with a testbed implementation in virtualized blade servers hosting a multi-tier online auction benchmark.",

    "abstract": "The future large-scale deployment of pervasive sensor network infrastructures calls for mechanisms enabling the extraction of general-purpose data at limited energy costs. The approach presented in this article relies on a simple algorithm to let a sensor network self-organize a virtual partitioning in correspondence to spatial regions characterized by similar sensing patterns, and to let distributed aggregation of sensorial data take place on a per-region basis. The result of this process is that a sensor network can be modeled as a collection of virtual macro sensors, each associated to a well-characterized region of the physical environment. Within each region, each physical sensor has the local availability of aggregated data about its region and is able to act as an access point to such data. This feature promises to be very suitable for a number of emerging usage scenarios. Our approach is described and evaluated in both a simulation environment and a real test bed, and quantitatively compared with related works in the area. Current limitations and areas of future development are also discussed.",

To state these theorems, we present probabilistic models to characterize the three important elements of the CAP theorem: consistency (C), availability or latency (A), and partition tolerance (P). The theorems show the un-achievable envelope, that is, which combinations of the parameters of the three models make them impossible to achieve together. Next, we present the design of a class of systems called Probabilistic CAP (PCAP) that perform close to the envelope described by our theorems. In addition, these systems allow applications running on a single data center to specify either a latency Service Level Agreement (SLA) or a consistency SLA. The PCAP systems automatically adapt, in real time and under changing network conditions, to meet the SLA while optimizing the other C/A metric. We incorporate PCAP into two popular key-value stores: Apache Cassandra and Riak. Our experiments with these two deployments, under realistic workloads, reveal that the PCAP systems satisfactorily meets SLAs and perform close to the achievable envelope. We also extend PCAP from a single data center to multiple geo-distributed data centers.",

We present the case for a paradigm shift to fully emergent computer software that places the burden of understanding entirely into the hands of software itself. These systems are autonomously assembled at runtime from discovered constituent parts and their internal health and external deployment environment continually monitored. An online, unsupervised learning system then uses runtime adaptation to continuously explore alternative system assemblies and locate optimal solutions. Based on our experience over the past 3 years, we define the problem space of emergent software and present a working case study of an emergent web server as a concrete example of the paradigm. Our results demonstrate two main aspects of the problem space for this case study: that different assemblies of behaviour are optimal in different deployment environment conditions and that these assemblies can be autonomously learned from generalised perception data while the system is online.",

    "abstract": "Self-adaptation provides a principled way to deal with software systems’ uncertainty during operation. Examples of such uncertainties are disturbances in the environment, variations in sensor readings, and changes in user requirements. As more systems with strict goals require self-adaptation, the need for formal guarantees in self-adaptive systems is becoming a high-priority concern. Designing self-adaptive software using principles from control theory has been identified as one of the approaches to provide guarantees. In general, self-adaptation covers a wide range of approaches to maintain system requirements under uncertainty, ranging from dynamic adaptation of system parameters to runtime architectural reconfiguration. Existing control-theoretic approaches have mainly focused on handling requirements in the form of setpoint values or as quantities to be optimized. Furthermore, existing research primarily focuses on handling uncertainty in the execution environment. This article presents SimCA*, which provides two contributions to the state-of-the-art in control-theoretic adaptation: (i) it supports requirements that keep a value above and below a required threshold, in addition to setpoint and optimization requirements; and (ii) it deals with uncertainty in system parameters, component interactions, system requirements, in addition to uncertainty in the environment. SimCA* provides guarantees for the three types of requirements of the system that is subject to different types of uncertainties. We evaluate SimCA* for two systems with strict requirements from different domains: an Unmanned Underwater Vehicle system used for oceanic surveillance and an Internet of Things application for monitoring a geographical area. The test results confirm that SimCA* can satisfy the three types of requirements in the presence of different types of uncertainty.",

Criticalities are consequences of events which take a system (in our case, a smart infrastructure) into an unstable state. They require the execution of specific response actions in order to bring them under control. The principal aim of CAAC is to grant the right set of access privileges (to facilitate response action execution), at the right time, to the right set of subjects, for the right duration, in order to control the criticalities within the system. In this regard, the CAAC model uses a stochastic model called the Action Generation Model to determine the required response actions for the combination of criticalities present within the system. It then facilitates response actions by adaptively altering the privileges to specific subjects, in a proactive manner, without the need for any explicit access requests. In this article, we formalize the CAAC model and validate it based on two design goals - proactivity and adaptiveness. Finally, we present a case study demonstrating CAAC’s operation on an oil-rig platform in order to aid in the response to health- and fire-related criticalities.",

Data consistency and conflict issues, which can arise when several agents concurrently access shared data, are handled using a purposely developed notion of logical time. This approach enables a transparent porting onto parallel/distributed architectures, as the developer is only in charge of defining the behavior of the agents, without having to cope with issues related to parallel programming and performance optimization. The approach has been evaluated for a very popular swarm algorithm, the ant-based spatial clustering and sorting of items, and results show good performance and scalability.",

    "abstract": "Applications that are constrained by low-latency requirements can hardly be executed on cloud infrastructures, given the high network delay required to reach remote servers. Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) is the reference architecture for executing applications on nodes that are located close to users (i.e., at the edge of the network). This way, the network overhead is reduced but new challenges emerge. The resources available on edge nodes are limited, workloads fluctuate since users can rapidly change location, and complex tasks are becoming widespread (e.g., machine learning inference). To address these issues, this article presents NEPTUNE , a serverless-based framework that automates the management of large-scale MEC infrastructures. In particular, NEPTUNE provides (i) the placement of serverless functions on MEC nodes according to users’ location, (ii) the resolution of resource contention scenarios by avoiding that single nodes be saturated, and (iii) the dynamic allocation of CPUs and GPUs to meet foreseen execution times. To assess NEPTUNE , we built a prototype based on K3S, an edge-dedicated version of Kubernetes, and executed a comprehensive set of experiments. Results show that NEPTUNE obtains a significant reduction in terms of response time, network overhead, and resource consumption compared with five state-of-the-art solutions.",

    "abstract": "Recently, network security has become an extremely vital issue that beckons the development of accurate and efficient solutions capable of effectively defending our network systems and the valuable information journeying through them. In this article, a distributed multiagent intrusion detection system (IDS) architecture is proposed, which attempts to provide an accurate and lightweight solution to network intrusion detection by tackling issues associated with the design of a distributed multiagent system, such as poor system scalability and the requirements of excessive processing power and memory storage. The proposed IDS architecture consists of (i) the Host layer with lightweight host agents that perform anomaly detection in network connections to their respective hosts, and (ii) the Classification layer whose main functions are to perform misuse detection for the host agents, detect distributed attacks, and disseminate network security status information to the whole network. The intrusion detection task is achieved through the employment of the lightweight Adaptive Sub-Eigenspace Modeling (ASEM)-based anomaly and misuse detection schemes. Promising experimental results indicate that ASEM-based schemes outperform the KNN and LOF algorithms, with high detection rates and low false alarm rates in the anomaly detection task, and outperform several well-known supervised classification methods such as C4.5 Decision Tree, SVM, NN, KNN, Logistic, and Decision Table (DT) in the misuse detection task. To assess the performance in a real-world scenario, the Relative Assumption Model, feature extraction techniques, and common network attack generation tools are employed to generate normal and anomalous traffic in a private LAN testbed. Furthermore, the scalability performance of the proposed IDS architecture is investigated through the simulation of the proposed agent communication scheme, and satisfactory linear relationships for both degradation of system response time and agent communication generated network traffic overhead are achieved.",

    "abstract": "Self-organized multi-agent systems (MAS) are still difficult to engineer, because, to deal with real world problems, a self-organized MAS should exhibit complex adaptive organizations. In this respect the holonic paradigm provides a solution for modelling complex organizational structures. Holons are defined as self-similar entities that are neither parts nor wholes. The organizational structure produced by holons is called a holarchy. A holonic MAS (HMAS) considers agents as holons that are grouped according to holarchies. The goal of this article is to introduce an architecture that allows holons to adapt to their environment. The metaphor is based upon the immune system and considers stimulations/requests as antigens and selected antibodies as reactions/answers. Each antibody is activated by specific antigens and stimulated and/or inhibited by other antibodies. The immune system rewards (respectively penalizes) selected antibodies, which constitutes a good (respectively wrong) answer to a request. This mechanism allows an agent to choose from a set of possible behaviors, the one that seems the best fit for a specific context. In this context, each holon, atomic or composed, encapsulates an immune system in order to select a behavior. For composed holons, each sub-holon is represented by the selected antibody of its immune system. The super-holon's immune system therefore contains one antibody per sub-holon. This recursive architecture corresponds with the recursive nature of the holarchy. This architecture is presented with an example of simulated robot soccer. From experiments under different conditions we show that this architecture has interesting properties.",

CFP is known to be unsolvable by arranging the robots evenly along the circumference of a circle C without leaving C —that is, starting from a configuration where the robots are on the boundary of C . We circumvent this impossibility result by designing a scheme based on concentric circles . This is the first scheme that deterministically solves CFP.

A key issue in this context is that of generating groups of agents such that the communication among agents of the same group is not subjected to comprehension problems. To this purpose, several approaches have been proposed in the past in order to form groups of agents based on some similarity measures among agents. Such similarity measures are mainly based on lexical and/or structural similarities among agent ontologies. However, the necessity of taking into account a semantic component of the similarity value arises, for example by considering the context in which a term is used in an agent ontology. Therefore we propose a clustering technique based on the HISENE semantic negotiation protocol, using a similarity value that has lexical, structural and semantic components. Moreover, we introduce a suitable multiagent architecture that allows computing agent similarities by means of an efficient distributed approach.",

    "abstract": "Connectivity , primarily a graph-theoretic concept, helps define the fault tolerance of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in the sense that it enables the sensors to communicate with each other so their sensed data can reach the sink. On the other hand, sensing coverage , an intrinsic architectural feature of WSNs plays an important role in meeting application-specific requirements, for example, to reliably extract relevant data about a sensed field. Sensing coverage and network connectivity are not quite orthogonal concepts. In fact, it has been proven that connectivity strongly depends on coverage and hence considerable attention has been paid to establish tighter connection between them although only loose lower bound on network connectivity of WSNs is known. In this article, we investigate connectivity based on the degree of sensing coverage by studying k-covered WSNs, where every location in the field is simultaneously covered (or sensed) by at least k sensors (property known as k-coverage , where k is the degree of coverage ). We observe that to derive network connectivity of k -covered WSNs, it is necessary to compute the sensor spatial density required to guarantee k -coverage. More precisely, we propose to use a model, called the Reuleaux Triangle , to characterize k -coverage with the help of Helly's Theorem and the analysis of the intersection of sensing disks of k sensors. Using a deterministic approach, we show that the sensor spatial density to guarantee k -coverage of a convex field is proportional to k and inversely proportional to the sensing range of the sensors. We also prove that network connectivity of k -covered WSNs is higher than their sensing coverage k . Furthermore, we propose a new measure of fault tolerance for k -covered WSNs, called conditional fault tolerance , based on the concepts of conditional connectivity and forbidden faulty sensor set that includes all the neighbors of a given sensor. We prove that k -covered WSNs can sustain a large number of sensor failures provided that the faulty sensor set does not include a forbidden faulty sensor set.",

In the absence of any enforcement mechanism or protocol, there is no incentive for one party to directly reciprocate during a transaction with another. Consequently, for such decentralized systems to function, protocols for self-organization need to explicitly promote cooperation in a manner where adherence to the protocol is incentivized. In this article we introduce a new generic model to achieve this. The model is based on peers repeatedly interacting to build up and maintain a dynamic social network of others that they can trust based on similarity of cooperation. This mechanism effectively incentivizes unselfish behavior, where peers with higher levels of cooperation gain higher payoff. We examine the model's behavior and robustness in detail. This includes the effect of peers self-adapting their cooperation level in response to maximizing their payoff, representing a Nash-equilibrium of the system.

    "abstract": "Most normative systems make use of explicit representations of norms (namely, obligations, prohibitions, and permissions) and associated mechanisms to support the self-regulation of open societies of self-interested and autonomous agents. A key problem in research on normative systems is that of how to synthesise effective and efficient norms. Manually designing norms is time consuming and error prone. An alternative is to automatically synthesise norms. However, norm synthesis is a computationally complex problem. We present a novel online norm synthesis mechanism, designed to synthesise compact normative systems. It yields normative systems composed of concise (simple) norms that effectively coordinate a multiagent system (MAS) without lapsing into overregulation. Our mechanism is based on a central authority that monitors a MAS, searching for undesired states. After detecting undesirable states, the central authority then synthesises norms aimed to avoid them in the future. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experimental results.",

Although dynamic coalition formation and partner switching (rewiring) have been shown to promote the emergence and maintenance of cooperation for self-interested agents, no prior work in the literature has investigated whether merging both mechanisms exhibits positive synergies that lead to increase cooperation even further. Therefore, we introduce and analyze a novel dynamic coalition formation mechanism, that uses partner switching, to help self-interested agents to increase their profits in a resource exchange environment. Our experiments show the effectiveness of our mechanism at increasing the agents’ profits, as well as the emergence of trading as the preferred behavior over different types of complex networks.",

Future grids will integrate a wide variety of heterogeneous producers and consumers that are unpredictable and operate at various scales. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) solutions will have to control these in order to attain global objectives at the macrolevel, while also considering private interests at the microlevel. This article proposes a generic holonic architecture to help the development of ICT control systems that meet these requirements. We show how this architecture can integrate heterogeneous control designs, including state-of-the-art smart grid solutions. To illustrate the applicability and utility of this generic architecture, we exemplify its use via a concrete proof-of-concept implementation for a holonic controller, which integrates two types of control solutions and manages a multiscale, multiobjective grid simulator in several scenarios. We believe that the proposed contribution is essential for helping to understand, to reason about, and to develop the “smart” side of future power grids .",

    "abstract": "Adaptiveness in distributed parallel applications is a key feature to provide satisfactory performance results in the face of unexpected events such as workload variations and time-varying user requirements. The adaptation process is based on the ability to change specific characteristics of parallel components (e.g., their parallelism degree) and to guarantee that such modifications of the application configuration are effective and durable. Reconfigurations often incur a cost on the execution (a performance overhead and/or an economic cost). For this reason advanced adaptation strategies have become of paramount importance. Effective strategies must achieve properties like control optimality (making decisions that optimize the global application QoS), reconfiguration stability expressed in terms of the average time between consecutive reconfigurations of the same component, and optimizing the reconfiguration amplitude (number of allocated/deallocated resources). To control such parameters, in this article we propose a method based on a Cooperative Model-based Predictive Control approach in which application controllers cooperate to make optimal reconfigurations and taking account of the durability and amplitude of their control decisions. The effectiveness and the feasibility of the methodology is demonstrated through experiments performed in a simulation environment and by comparing it with other existing techniques.",

Next, two forms of dynamic heterogeneity are investigated: nonadaptive mixed strategies and adaptive strategies, which learn online. Our second contribution is to show that mixed strategies offer Pareto efficiency consistently comparable with the most efficient static heterogeneous configurations. Since the particular configuration required for high Pareto efficiency in a scenario will not be known in advance, our third contribution is to show how decentralized online learning can lead to more efficient outcomes than the homogeneous case. In some cases, outcomes from online learning were more efficient than all other evaluated configuration types. Our fourth contribution is to show that online learning typically leads to outcomes more evenly spread over the objective space.

    "abstract": "In multiplex networks, agents are connected by multiple types of links; a multiplex network can be split into more than one network layer that is composed of the same type of links and involved agents. Each network link type has a bias for communicating different types of resources; thus, the task’s access to the required resources in multiplex networks is strongly related to the network link types. However, traditional task allocation and load balancing methods only considered the situations of agents themselves and did not address the effects of network link types in multiplex networks. To solve this problem, this article considers both link types and agents, and substantially extends the existing work by highlighting the effect of network layers on task allocation and load balancing. Two multiplex network-adapted models of task allocation with load balancing are presented: network layer-oriented allocation and agent-oriented allocation. This article also addresses the unreliability in multiplex networks, which includes the unreliable links and agents, and implements a reliable task allocation based on a negotiation reputation and reward mechanism. Our findings show that both of our presented models can effectively and robustly satisfy the task allocation objectives in unreliable multiplex networks; the experiments prove that they can significantly reduce the time costs and improve the success rate of tasks for multiplex networks over the traditional simplex network-adapted task allocation model. Lastly, we find that our presented network layer-oriented allocation performs much better in terms of reliability and allocation time compared to our presented agent-oriented allocation, which further explains the importance of network layers in multiplex networks.",

To deal with this problem, several intrusion response systems (IRSs) have been proposed lately. IRSs extend the IDSs by providing an automatic response to the detected attack. Such a response is usually selected either with a static attack-response mapping or by quantitatively evaluating all available responses, given a set of predefined criteria. In this article, we introduce a probabilistic model-based IRS built on the Markov decision process (MDP) framework. In contrast to most existing approaches to intrusion response, the proposed IRS effectively captures the dynamics of both the defended system and the attacker and is able to compose atomic response actions to plan optimal multiobjective long-term response policies to protect the system. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed IRS by showing that long-term response planning always outperforms short-term planning, and we conduct a thorough performance assessment to show that the proposed IRS can be adopted to protect large distributed systems at runtime.",

Many goal-oriented frameworks exist in the literature to be used for the purpose. However, modeling goals is a burden for the business analyst. This work proposes an automatic approach for extracting goals from a business process for supporting adaptive workflows. The approach consists of a static analysis of the global workflow state.

These systems operate under continuous perturbations due to the unpredicted behaviors of people and the occurrence of exogenous changes in the environment. In this article, we introduce a notion of ensembles for which, systems with collective adaptability can be built as an emergent aggregation of autonomous and self-adaptive agents. Building upon this notion of ensemble, we present a distributed adaptation approach for systems composed by ensembles: collections of agents with their respective roles and goals. In these systems, adaptation is triggered by the run-time occurrence of an extraordinary circumstance, called issue. It is handled by an issue resolution process that involves agents affected by the issue to collaboratively adapt with minimal impact on their own preferences. Central to our approach is the implementation of a collective adaptation engine (CAE) able to solve issues in a collective fashion. The approach is instantiated in the context of a smart mobility scenario through which its main features are illustrated. To demonstrate the approach in action and evaluate it, we exploit the DeMOCAS framework, simulating the operation of an urban mobility scenario. We have executed a set of experiments with the goal to show how the CAE performs in terms of feasibility and scalability. With this approach, we are able to demonstrate how collective adaptation opens up new possibilities for tackling urban mobility challenges making it more sustainable respect to selfish and competitive behaviours.",

However, a discernible disconnect exists among research efforts across different communities.

Currently, no clear guidance exists on which XAI methods suit which specific stakeholders and their distinct needs. This hinders the achievement of the goal of XAI: providing human users with understandable interpretations. To bridge this gap, this article presents a comprehensive XAI roadmap. Based on an extensive literature review, the roadmap summarizes different stakeholders, their explanation needs at different stages of the AI system lifecycle, the questions they may pose, and existing XAI methods. Then, by utilizing stakeholders’ inquiries as a conduit, the roadmap connects their needs to prevailing XAI methods, providing a guideline to assist researchers and practitioners to determine more easily which XAI methodologies can meet the specific needs of stakeholders in AASs. Finally, the roadmap discusses the limitations of existing XAI methods and outlines directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "This article presents So-Grid, a set of bio-inspired algorithms tailored to the decentralized construction of a Grid information system that features adaptive and self-organization characteristics. Such algorithms exploit the properties of swarm systems, in which a number of entities/agents perform simple operations at the local level, but together engender an advanced form of swarm intelligence at the global level. In particular, So-Grid provides two main functionalities: logical reorganization of resources, inspired by the behavior of some species of ants and termites that move and collect items within their environment, and resource discovery, inspired by the mechanisms through which ants searching for food sources are able to follow the pheromone traces left by other ants. These functionalities are correlated, since an intelligent dissemination can facilitate discovery. In the Grid environment, a number of ant-like agents autonomously travel the Grid through P2P interconnections and use biased probability functions to: (i) replicate resource descriptors in order to favor resource discovery; (ii) collect resource descriptors with similar characteristics in nearby Grid hosts; (iii) foster the dissemination of descriptors corresponding to fresh (recently updated) resources and to resources having high quality of service (QoS) characteristics. Simulation analysis shows that the So-Grid replication algorithm is capable of reducing the entropy of the system and efficiently disseminating content. Moreover, as descriptors are progressively reorganized and replicated, the So-Grid discovery algorithm allows users to reach Grid hosts that store information about a larger number of useful resources in a shorter amount of time. The proposed approach features characteristics, including self-organization, scalability and adaptivity, which make it useful for a dynamic and partially unreliable distributed system.",

Concretely, our first contribution is a set of techniques to translate discrete sequence equations (also known as difference equations) into new p2p protocols called sequence protocols . Sequence protocols are self-adaptive, scalable, and fault-tolerant, with applicability in p2p settings like Grids. A sequence protocol is a set of probabilistic local and message-passing actions for each process. These actions are translated from terms in a set of source sequence equations. Individual processes do not simulate the source sequence equations completely. Instead, each process executes probabilistic local and message passing actions, so that the emergent round-to-round behavior of the sequence protocol in a p2p system can be probabilistically predicted by the source sequence equations. The article's second contribution is the design and evaluation of a set of sequence protocols for detection of two global triggers in a distributed system: threshold detection and interval detection. This article's third contribution is a new self-adaptive Grid computing protocol called HoneyAdapt. HoneyAdapt is derived from sequence equations modeling adaptive bee foraging behavior in nature. HoneyAdapt is intended for Grid applications that allow Grid clients, at run-time, a choice of algorithms for executing chunks of the application's dataset. HoneyAdapt tells each Grid client how to adaptively select at run-time, for each chunk it receives, a good algorithm for computing the chunk—this selection is based on continuous feedback from other clients. Finally, we design a variant of HoneyAdapt, called HoneySort, for application to Grid parallelized sorting settings using the master-worker paradigm. Our evaluation of these contributions consists of mathematical analysis, large-scale trace-based simulation results, and experimental results from a HoneySort deployment.",

Each VN directs its local client nodes to align themselves on the local portion of the target curve. The resulting motion coordination protocol is self-stabilizing, in that each robot can begin the execution in any arbitrary state and at any arbitrary location in the plane. In addition, self-stabilization ensures that the robots can adapt to changes in the desired target formation.",

A firewall determines whether to accept or discard a packet that passes through it based on its policy. However, most real-life firewalls have been plagued with policy faults, which either allow malicious traffic or block legitimate traffic. Due to the complexity of firewall policies, manually locating the faults of a firewall policy and further correcting them are difficult. Automatically correcting the faults of a firewall policy is an important and challenging problem. In this article, we first propose a fault model for firewall policies including five types of faults. For each type of fault, we present an automatic correction technique. Second, we propose the first systematic approach that employs these five techniques to automatically correct all or part of the misclassified packets of a faulty firewall policy. Third, we conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Experimental results show that our approach is effective to correct a faulty firewall policy with three of these types of faults.",

They will be required to act in a vast information landscape, asserting the relevance of data spread in the cyber world, in order to let their human users become aware of the content they really need. This is a remarkably similar situation to what the human brain has to do all the time when deciding what information coming from the surrounding environment is interesting and what can simply be ignored. The brain performs this task using so called cognitive heuristics, i.e. simple, rapid, yet very effective schemes. In this article, we propose a new approach that exploits one of these heuristics, the recognition heuristic , for developing a self-adaptive system that deals with effective data dissemination in opportunistic networks. We show how to implement it and provide an extensive analysis via simulation. Specifically, results show that the proposed solution is as effective as state-of-the-art solutions for data dissemination in opportunistic networks, while requiring far less resources. Finally, our sensitiveness analysis shows how various parameters depend on the context where nodes are situated, and suggest corresponding optimal configurations for the algorithm.",

    "abstract": "This article describes Distributed W-Learning (DWL), a reinforcement learning-based algorithm for collaborative agent-based optimization of pervasive systems. DWL supports optimization towards multiple heterogeneous policies and addresses the challenges arising from the heterogeneity of the agents that are charged with implementing them. DWL learns and exploits the dependencies between agents and between policies to improve overall system performance. Instead of always executing the locally-best action, agents learn how their actions affect their immediate neighbors and execute actions suggested by neighboring agents if their importance exceeds the local action's importance when scaled using a predefined or learned collaboration coefficient. We have evaluated DWL in a simulation of an Urban Traffic Control (UTC) system, a canonical example of the large-scale pervasive systems that we are addressing. We show that DWL outperforms widely deployed fixed-time and simple adaptive UTC controllers under a variety of traffic loads and patterns. Our results also confirm that enabling collaboration between agents is beneficial as is the ability for agents to learn the degree to which it is appropriate for them to collaborate. These results suggest that DWL is a suitable basis for optimization in other large-scale systems with similar characteristics.",

    "abstract": "One of the major challenges in the research of mobile ad hoc networks is designing dynamic, scalable, and low cost (in terms of utilization of resources) routing protocols usable in real-world applications. Routing in ad hoc networks has been explored to a large extent over the past decade and different protocols have been proposed. They are based on a two-dimensional view of the ad hoc network geographical region, and are not always realistic. In this article, we propose a bird flight-inspired, highly scalable, dynamic, energy-efficient, and position-based routing protocol called Bird Flight-Inspired Routing Protocol (BFIRP). The proposed protocol is inspired by the navigation of birds over long distances following the great circle arc, the shortest arc connecting two points on the surface of a sphere. This sheds light on how birds save their energy while navigating over thousands of miles. The proposed algorithm can be readily applied in many real-world applications, as it is designed with a realistic three-dimensional view of the network’s geographic region. In the proposed algorithm, each node obtains its location coordinates (X, Y, Z), and speed from the GPS (Global Positioning System); whereas, the destination’s location coordinates (X, Y, Z), and speed are obtained from any other distributed localized service. Based on the location information, the source and each intermediate node choose their immediate neighbor as the next hop that has the maximum priority. The priority is calculated by taking into consideration the energy of the node, the distance between the node and the destination and the degree of closeness of the node to the trajectory of the great circle arc between the current node and the destination. The proposed algorithm is simulated in J-SIM and compared with the algorithms of Ad Hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV), and Most Forward Within Distance R (MFR) routing protocols. The results of the simulations show that the proposed BFIRP algorithm is highly scalable, and has low end-to-end delay compared to AODV. The algorithm is also simulated in various scenarios, and the results demonstrate that BFIRP is more efficient than AODV in energy and throughput by 20% and 15% respectively. It also shows satisfactory improvement over MFR in terms of throughput and routing overhead.",

In software testing, one of the most important research issues is to determine the sufficiency of a test suite to verify the software under test. Existing adequacy criteria for testing traditional software, however, have not explored the dimension of serial test inputs and have not considered context changes when constructing test suites. In this article, we define the concept of context diversity to capture the extent of context changes in serial inputs and propose three strategies to study how context diversity may improve the effectiveness of the data-flow testing criteria. Our case study shows that the strategy that uses test cases with higher context diversity can significantly improve the effectiveness of existing data-flow testing criteria for context-aware pervasive software. In addition, test suites with higher context diversity are found to execute significantly longer paths, which may provide a clue that reveals why context diversity can contribute to the improvement of effectiveness of test suites.",

To continuously perform analytics on the fly within the stream, state-of-the-art DSMSs host streaming applications as a set of interconnected operators, with each operator encapsulating the semantic of a specific operation. For parallel execution on a particular platform, these operators need to be appropriately replicated in multiple instances that split and process the workload simultaneously. Because the way operators are partitioned affects the resulting performance of streaming applications, it is essential for DSMSs to have a method to compare different operators and make holistic replication decisions to avoid performance bottlenecks and resource wastage. To this end, we propose a stepwise profiling approach to optimize application performance on a given execution platform. It automatically scales distributed computations over streams based on application features and processing power of provisioned resources and builds the relationship between provisioned resources and application performance metrics to evaluate the efficiency of the resulting configuration. Experimental results confirm that the proposed approach successfully fulfills its goals with minimal profiling overhead.",

However, in practical complex environments, the interactions between agents can be sparse, and each agent's interacting partners may change frequently and randomly. To this end, we investigate the multiagent coordination problems in cooperative environments under a social learning framework. We consider a large population of agents where each agent interacts with another agent randomly chosen from the population in each round. Each agent learns its policy through repeated interactions with the rest of the agents via social learning. It is not clear a priori if all agents can learn a consistent optimal coordination policy in such a situation. We distinguish two different types of learners depending on the amount of information each agent can perceive: individual action learner and joint action learner . The learning performance of both types of learners is evaluated under a number of challenging deterministic and stochastic cooperative games, and the influence of the information sharing degree on the learning performance also is investigated—a key difference from the learning framework involving repeated interactions among fixed agents.",

The introduction of a virtual robot restructures the formation control problem into a tracking control problem between the virtual reference robot and follower robots. A novel obstacle avoidance approach is proposed based upon the scaling of whole (partial) formation corresponding to a centralized (distributed) framework. For the distributed environment with limited communication, our approach utilized proportional-integral average consensus estimators, whereby information from each robot diffuses through the communication network. The theoretical contribution is to determine the time constant involved in the diffusion process, which can affect overall system performance. The asymptotic convergence of follower robots to the position and orientation of the reference robot is ensured using the Lyapunov function. The new technique is tested with complete, limited, and no information availability. Several simulation results are provided that demonstrate the formation control and obstacle avoidance for multirobots using the proposed scheme.",

    "abstract": "A self-managing software system should be able to monitor and analyze its runtime behavior and make adaptation decisions accordingly to meet certain desirable objectives. Traditional software adaptation techniques and recent “models@runtime” approaches usually require an a priori model for a system’s dynamic behavior. Oftentimes the model is difficult to define and labor-intensive to maintain, and tends to get out of date due to adaptation and architecture decay. We propose an alternative approach that does not require defining the system’s behavior model beforehand, but instead involves mining software component interactions from system execution traces to build a probabilistic usage model, which is in turn used to analyze, plan, and execute adaptations. In this article, we demonstrate how such an approach can be realized and effectively used to address a variety of adaptation concerns. In particular, we describe the details of one application of this approach for safely applying dynamic changes to a running software system without creating inconsistencies. We also provide an overview of two other applications of the approach, identifying potentially malicious (abnormal) behavior for self-protection, and improving deployment of software components in a distributed setting for performance self-optimization. Finally, we report on our experiments with engineering self-management features in an emergency deployment system using the proposed mining approach.",

On clouds, this represents a necessary feature to keep the operating cost at affordable levels while accommodating user-defined QoS requirements. In this article, we study this problem from a game-theoretic perspective. The control logic driving elasticity is distributed among local control agents capable of choosing the right amount of resources to use by each module. In a first step, we model the problem as a noncooperative game in which agents pursue their self-interest. We identify the Nash equilibria and we design a distributed procedure to reach the best equilibrium in the Pareto sense. As a second step, we extend the noncooperative formulation with a decentralized incentive-based mechanism in order to promote cooperation by moving the agreement point closer to the system optimum.

Multiagent computing has already been widely envisioned as a powerful paradigm for modeling autonomous multi-entity systems with adaptation to dynamic environments. Therefore, this article presents a novel multiagent perspective and approach to understanding crowdsourcing systems, which can be used to correlate the research on crowdsourcing and multiagent systems and inspire possible interdisciplinary research between the two areas. This article mainly discusses the following two aspects: (1) The multiagent perspective can be used for conducting a comprehensive survey on the state of the art of crowdsourcing, and (2) the multiagent approach can bring about concrete enhancements for crowdsourcing technology and inspire future research directions that enable crowdsourcing research to overcome the typical challenges in crowdsourcing technology.

Operators handle high data rates running parallel replicas across multiple processors and hosts. To guarantee consistent performance without wasting resources in the face of variable workloads, auto-scaling techniques have been studied to adapt operator parallelism at run-time. However, most of the effort has been spent under the assumption of homogeneous computing infrastructures, neglecting the complexity of modern environments. We consider the problem of deciding both how many operator replicas should be executed and which types of computing nodes should be acquired. We devise heterogeneity-aware policies by means of a two-layered hierarchy of controllers. While application-level components steer the adaptation process for whole applications, aiming to guarantee user-specified requirements, lower-layer components control auto-scaling of single operators. We tackle the fundamental challenge of performance and workload uncertainty, exploiting Bayesian optimization (BO) and reinforcement learning (RL) to devise policies. The evaluation shows that our approach is able to meet users’ requirements in terms of response time and adaptation overhead, while minimizing the cost due to resource usage, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Despite the rapid advance of multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) in cooperative MASs, one of the major challenges that remain is the simultaneous learning and interaction of independent agents in dynamic environments in the presence of stochastic rewards. State-of-the-art MADRL models struggle to perform well in Coordinated Multi-agent Object Transportation Problems (CMOTPs) wherein agents must coordinate with each other and learn from stochastic rewards. In contrast, humans often learn rapidly to adapt to non-stationary environments that require coordination among people. In this article, motivated by the demonstrated ability of cognitive models based on Instance-based Learning Theory (IBLT) to capture human decisions in many dynamic decision-making tasks, we propose three variants of multi-agent IBL models (MAIBLs). The idea of these MAIBL algorithms is to combine the cognitive mechanisms of IBLT and the techniques of MADRL models to deal with coordination MASs in stochastic environments from the perspective of independent learners. We demonstrate that the MAIBL models exhibit faster learning and achieve better coordination in a dynamic CMOTP task with various settings of stochastic rewards compared to current MADRL models. We discuss the benefits of integrating cognitive insights into MADRL models.",

    "abstract": "Security attacks present unique challenges to the design of self-adaptation mechanism for software-intensive systems due to the adversarial nature of the environment. Game-theoretical approaches have been explored in security to model malicious behaviors and design reliable defense for the system in a mathematically grounded manner. However, modeling the system as a single player, as done in prior works, is insufficient for the system under partial compromise and for the design of fine-grained defensive policies where the rest of the system with autonomy can cooperate to mitigate the impact of attacks. To address such issues, we propose a new self-adaptation framework incorporating Bayesian game theory and model the defender (i.e., the system) at the granularity of components. Under security attacks, the architecture model of the system is automatically translated, by the proposed translation process with designed algorithms, into a multi-player Bayesian game. This representation allows each component to be modeled as an independent player, while security attacks are encoded as variant types for the components. By solving for pure equilibrium (i.e., adaptation response), the system’s optimal defensive strategy is dynamically computed, enhancing system resilience against security attacks by maximizing system utility. We validate the effectiveness of our framework through two sets of experiments using generic benchmark tasks tailored for the security domain. Additionally, we exemplify the practical application of our approach through a real-world implementation in the Secure Water Treatment System to demonstrate the applicability and potency in mitigating security risks.",

In this article, we present a generic self-supervised hybrid learning (SHIL) framework for achieving efficient online security attack detection in containerized systems. SHIL can effectively combine both unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms but does not require any manual data labeling. We have implemented a prototype of SHIL and conducted experiments over 46 real-world security attacks in 29 commonly used server applications. Our experimental results show that SHIL can reduce false alarms by 33%–93% compared to existing supervised, unsupervised, or semi-supervised machine learning schemes while achieving a higher or similar detection rate.",

The developers of WSNs can specify “invariants” that must be satisfied by the WSNs. We present a framework, Hierarchical SEnsor Network Debugging (H-SEND), for lightweight checking of invariants. H-SEND is able to detect a large class of faults in data-gathering WSNs, and leverages the existing message flow in the network by buffering and piggybacking messages. H-SEND checks as closely to the source of a fault as possible, pinpointing the fault quickly and efficiently in terms of additional network traffic. Therefore, H-SEND is suited to bandwidth or communication energy constrained networks. A specification expression is provided for specifying invariants so that a protocol developer can write behavioral level invariants. We hypothesize that data from sensor nodes does not change dramatically, but rather changes gradually over time. We extend our framework for the invariants that includes values determined at run-time in order to detect data trends. The value range can be based on information local to a single node or the surrounding nodes' values. Using our system, developers can write invariants to detect data trends without prior knowledge of correct values. Automatic value detection can be used to detect anomalies that cannot be detected in existing WSNs. To demonstrate the benefits of run-time range detection and fault checking, we construct a prototype WSN using CO 2 and temperature sensors coupled to Mica2 motes. We show that our method can detect sudden changes of the environments with little overhead in communication, computation, and storage.",

    "abstract": "We present a modeling laboratory, Virtual Laboratory for the Simulation and Analysis of Social Group Evolution (ViSAGE), that views the organization of human communities and the experience of individuals in a community as contingent upon on the dynamic properties, or micro-laws , of social groups. The laboratory facilitates the theorization and validation of these properties through an iterative research processes that involves (1) forward simulation experiments, which are used to formalize dynamic group properties, (2) reverse engineering from real data on how the parameters are distributed among individual actors in the community, and (3) grounded research, such as participant observation, that follows specific activities of real actors in a community and determines if, or how well, the micro-laws describe the way choices are made in real world, local settings. In this article we report on the design of ViSAGE. We first give some background to the model. Next we detail each component. We then describe a set of simulation experiments that we used to further design and clarify ViSAGE as a tool for studying emergent properties/phenomena in social networks.",

    "abstract": "Topology control protocol aims to efficiently adjust the network topology of wireless networks in a self-adaptive fashion to improve the performance and scalability of networks. This is especially essential to large-scale multihop wireless networks (e.g., wireless sensor networks). Fault-tolerant topology control has been studied recently. In order to achieve both sparseness (i.e., the number of links is linear with the number of nodes) and fault tolerance (i.e., can survive certain level of node/link failures), different geometric topologies were proposed and used as the underlying network topologies for wireless networks. However, most of the existing topology control algorithms can only be applied to two-dimensional (2D) networks where all nodes are distributed in a 2D plane. In practice, wireless networks may be deployed in three-dimensional (3D) space, such as under water wireless sensor networks in ocean or mobile ad hoc networks among space shuttles in space. This article seeks to investigate self-organizing fault-tolerant topology control protocols for large-scale 3D wireless networks. Our new protocols not only guarantee k -connectivity of the network, but also ensure the bounded node degree and constant power stretch factor even under k −1 node failures. All of our proposed protocols are localized algorithms, which only use one-hop neighbor information and constant messages with small time complexity. Thus, it is easy to update the topology efficiently and self-adaptively for large-scale dynamic networks. Our simulation confirms our theoretical proofs for all proposed 3D topologies.",

    "abstract": "This article addresses the consensus problem in asynchronous systems prone to process crashes, where additionally the processes are anonymous (they cannot be distinguished one from the other: they have no name and execute the same code). To circumvent the three computational adversaries (asynchrony, failures, and anonymity) each process is provided with a failure detector of a class denoted ψ , that gives it an upper bound on the number of processes that are currently alive (in a nonanonymous system, the classes ψ and P ---the class of perfect failure detectors---are equivalent). The article first presents a simple ψ -based consensus algorithm where the processes decide in 2 t + 1 asynchronous rounds (where t is an upper bound on the number of faulty processes). It then shows one of its main results, namely 2 t + 1 is a lower bound for consensus in the anonymous systems equipped with ψ . The second contribution addresses early-decision. The article presents and proves correct an early-deciding algorithm where the processes decide in min(2 f + 2, 2 t + 1) asynchronous rounds (where f is the actual number of process failures). This leads us to think that anonymity doubles the cost (with respect to synchronous systems) and it is conjectured that min(2 f + 2, 2 t + 1) is the corresponding lower bound. The article finally considers the k -set agreement problem in anonymous systems. It first shows that the previous ψ -based consensus algorithm solves the k -set agreement problem in Rt = 2⌊t k⌋ + 1 asynchronous rounds. Then, considering a family of failure detector classes { ψℓ }0 ≤ ℓ &lt; k that generalizes the class ψ (= ψ 0 ), the article presents an algorithm that solves the k -set agreement in Rt,ℓ = 2 ⌊ t k − ℓ ⌋ + 1 asynchronous rounds. This last formula relates the cost ( Rt,ℓ ) the coordination degree of the problem ( k ), the maximum number of failures ( t ), and the the strength ( ℓ ) of the underlying failure detector. Finally the article concludes by presenting problems that remain open.",

To achieve adaptation, software must be designed and implemented by following suitable criteria, methods, and strategies. Past research has been mostly addressing adaptation by developing solutions at the software architecture level. This work, instead, focuses on finer-grain programming language-level solutions. We analyze three main linguistic approaches: metaprogramming, aspect-oriented programming, and context-oriented programming. The first two are general-purpose linguistic mechanisms, whereas the third is a specific and focused approach developed to support context-aware applications. This paradigm provides specialized language-level abstractions to implement dynamic adaptation and modularize behavioral variations in adaptive systems. The article shows how the three approaches can support the implementation of adaptive systems and compares the pros and cons offered by each solution.",

    "abstract": "Convention emergence solves the problem of choosing, in a decentralized way and among all equally beneficial conventions, the same convention for the entire population in the system for their own benefit. Our previous work has shown that reaching 100% agreement is not as straighforward as assumed by previous researchers, that, in order to save computational resources fixed the convergence rate to 90% (measuring the time it takes for 90% of the population to coordinate on the same action). In this article we present the notion of social instruments as a set of mechanisms that facilitate and accelerate the emergence of norms from repeated interactions between members of a society, only accessing local and public information and thus ensuring agents' privacy and anonymity. Specifically, we focus on two social instruments: rewiring and observation. Our main goal is to provide agents with tools that allow them to leverage their social network of interactions while effectively addressing coordination and learning problems, paying special attention to dissolving metastable subconventions. The first experimental results show that even with the usage of the proposed instruments, convergence is not accelerated or even obtained in irregular networks. This result leads us to perform an exhaustive analysis of irregular networks discovering what we have defined as Self-Reinforcing Structures (SRS). The SRS are topological configurations of nodes that promote the establishment and persistence of subconventions by producing a continuous reinforcing effect on the frontier agents. Finally, we propose a more sophisticated composed social instrument (observation + rewiring) for robust resolution of subconventions , which works by the dissolution of the stable frontiers caused by the Self-Reinforcing Substructures (SRS) within the social network.",

    "abstract": "Intelligent agents often have the same or similar tasks and sometimes they cooperate to solve a given problem. These agents typically know how to observe their local environment and how to react on certain observations, for instance, and this knowledge may be represented in form of rules. However, many environments are dynamic in the sense that from time to time novel rules are required or old rules become obsolete. In this article we propose and investigate new techniques for knowledge acquisition by novelty detection and reaction as well as obsoleteness detection and reaction that an agent may use for self-adaptation to new situations. For that purpose we consider classifiers based on probabilistic rules. Premises of new rules are learned autonomously while conclusions are either obtained from human experts or from other agents which have learned appropriate rules in the past. By means of knowledge exchange, agents will efficiently be enabled to cope with situations they were not confronted with before. This kind of collaborative intelligence follows the human archetype: Humans are able to learn from each other by communicating learned rules. We demonstrate some properties of the knowledge acquisition techniques using artificial data as well as data from the field of intrusion detection.",

Understanding primates’ social and communication systems and applying what is learned from them to engineering domains will likely lead to solutions to a number of problems. Scent-marking is an important behavior among primates and many other mammals. In this article, inspired by primates’ scent-marking activity, we propose and study a collaboration strategy for mobile and static sensors with RFID tags, where mobile sensors can be treated as robots or mobile actuators and can leave information to direct others to find them. Mobile sensors are equipped with RFID tags (or sensors) that can be deployed whenever needed, and RFID tags (or sensors) carry related information for other robots to pick up. We propose several primate-inspired communication mechanisms, including delayed-and-relayed and scent-trail communication among robots. We analytically model and simulate scent-trail communication. We also study a tracking and pursuing scheme of mobile sensors using simulations in terms of robot speeds, searching function, deployment density, turning function, and so on. We assume that robots (mobile sensors or mobile actuators) are capable of deploying/throwing-out sensors/RFID tags.",

    "abstract": "The complexity of systems is considered an obstacle to the progress of the IT industry. Autonomic computing is presented as the alternative to cope with the growing complexity. It is a holistic approach, in which the systems are able to configure, heal, optimize, and protect by themselves. Web-based applications are an example of systems where the complexity is high. The number of components, their interoperability, and workload variations are factors that may lead to performance failures or unavailability scenarios. The occurrence of these scenarios affects the revenue and reputation of businesses that rely on these types of applications. In this article, we present a self-healing framework for Web-based applications ( SHõ WA). SHõ WA is composed by several modules, which monitor the application, analyze the data to detect and pinpoint anomalies, and execute recovery actions autonomously. The monitoring is done by a small aspect-oriented programming agent. This agent does not require changes to the application source code and includes adaptive and selective algorithms to regulate the level of monitoring. The anomalies are detected and pinpointed by means of statistical correlation. The data analysis detects changes in the server response time and analyzes if those changes are correlated with the workload or are due to a performance anomaly. In the presence of performance anomalies, the data analysis pinpoints the anomaly. Upon the pinpointing of anomalies, SHõ WA executes a recovery procedure. We also present a study about the detection and localization of anomalies, the accuracy of the data analysis, and the performance impact induced by SHõ WA. Two benchmarking applications, exercised through dynamic workloads, and different types of anomaly were considered in the study. The results reveal that (1) the capacity of SHõ WA to detect and pinpoint anomalies while the number of end users affected is low; (2) SHõ WA was able to detect anomalies without raising any false alarm; and (3) SHõ WA does not induce a significant performance overhead (throughput was affected in less than 1%, and the response time delay was no more than 2 milliseconds).",

For fixed networked devices, SDPs such as SLP, Bonjour, and UPnP have been proposed. For more dynamic networked environments such as ad hoc, sensor, and wireless networks, a set of discovery technologies have been designed to operate optimally in such conditions; these include protocols like Ariadne, Allia, GSD, and UDDI. Hence, it is possible to advertise and discover services in diverse network types using one of a suite of technologies. Importantly, there are differences between individual protocols in terms of: (i) service description language, (ii) message format, (iii) directory architecture, (iv) discovery protocol behavior, (v) network communication, and (vi) nonfunctional features. These differences mean it is not possible to discover services with one protocol that is advertised by another and vice versa; we characterize this as service discovery protocol heterogeneity . In this article, we propose SeDiM, a dynamic middleware solution to allow heterogeneous discovery protocols within and across different domains to interoperate with one another. SeDiM is evaluated within a case study that demonstrates transparent interoperation of protocols including SLP and Bonjour in highly heterogeneous environments.",

In recent years, the focus of optimization within scientific workflows has primarily been on computational tasks and workflow makespan. However, as workflow-based analysis becomes ever more data intensive, data optimization is becoming a prime concern. Moreover, scientific workflows can scale along several dimensions: (i) number of computational tasks, (ii) heterogeneity of computational resources, and the (iii) size and type (static versus streamed) of data involved. Adapting workflow structure in response to these scalability challenges remains an important research objective. Understanding how a workflow graph can be restructured in an automated manner (through task merge, for instance), to address constraints of a particular execution environment is explored in this work, using a multi-objective evolutionary approach. Our approach attempts to adapt the workflow structure to achieve both compute and data optimization. The question of when to terminate the evolutionary search in order to conserve computations is tackled with a novel termination criterion. The results presented in this article demonstrate the feasibility of the termination criterion and demonstrate that significant optimization can be achieved with a multi-objective approach.",

    "abstract": "Resource allocation is a common problem in many technical systems. In multi-agent systems, the decentralized or regionalized solution of this problem usually requires the agents to cooperate due to their limited resources and knowledge. At the same time, if these systems are of large scale, scalability issues can be addressed by a self-organizing hierarchical system structure that enables problem decomposition and compartmentalization. In open systems, various uncertainties—introduced by the environment as well as the agents’ possibly self-interested or even malicious behavior—have to be taken into account to be able to allocate the resources according to the actual demand. In this article, we present a trust- and cooperation-based algorithm that solves a dynamic resource allocation problem in open systems of systems. To measure and deal with uncertainties imposed by the environment and the agents at runtime, the algorithm uses the social concept of trust. In a hierarchical setting, we additionally show how agents create constraint models by learning the capabilities of subordinate agents if these are not able or willing to disclose this information. Throughout the article, the creation of power plant schedules in decentralized autonomous power management systems serves as a running example.",

State information collected via the sensor network also enables these systems to actuate mobile agents so as to achieve surveillance goals, such as target capture and asset protection. But satisfying these goals is complicated by the fact that the track information in a sensor network is routed to mobile agents through multihop wireless communication links and is thus subject to message delays and losses. Stabilization must also be considered in designing pursuer strategies so as to deal with state corruption as well as suboptimal evader strategies. In this article, we formulate optimal pursuit control strategies in the presence of network effects, assuming that target track information has been established locally in the sensor network. We adapt ideas from the theory of differential games to networked games—including ones involving nonperiodic track updates, message losses and message delays—to derive optimal strategies, bounds on the information requirements, and scaling properties of these bounds. We show the inherent stabilization features of our pursuit strategies, both in terms of implementation as well as the strategies themselves.",

Regarding hardness results, we show that (1) while one leads-to (respectively, ensures ) property can be added in polynomial-time, the problem of adding two such properties (or any combination of leads-to and ensures ) is NP-complete, (2) if maximum non-determinism is desired then the problem of adding even a single leads-to property is NP-complete, and (3) the problem of providing maximum non-determinism while adding a single bounded-time leads-to property to a real-time program is NP-complete (in the size of the program's region graph) even if the original program satisfies the corresponding unbounded leads-to property.",

    "abstract": "Ambient Intelligence (AmI) is an IT concept by which mobile users shall be seamlessly supported in their everyday activities. This includes interactions with remote resources as well as with their current physical environment. We have developed the so-called Ad hoc Service Grid (ASG) infrastructure that supports the latter form of interactions. It allows operators to cover arbitrary locations with ambient services in a drop-and-deploy fashion. An ambient service may autonomously distribute (replicate and migrate) within an ASG network to optimize its availability, response times, and network usage. In this article, we propose a fully decentralized, dynamic, and adaptive service placement algorithm for AmI environments like the ASG. This algorithm achieves a coordinated global placement pattern that minimizes the communication costs without any central controller. It does not even require additional communication among the replicas. Moreover, placement patterns stabilize if no changes occur in the environment while replicas still retain their ability to adapt. Mechanisms for self-organized placement of services are very important for AmI environments in general since they allow for autonomous adaptations to dynamic changes and, thus, remove the need for manual (re)configuration of a running system. We present a detailed evaluation of the algorithm's performance and compare it with three other algorithms to show its competitiveness. Furthermore, we discuss how the desired self-organizing behavior emerges from the interactions of a few simple, local rules that govern the individual placement decisions. In order to do so, we give an in-depth analysis of a series of emergent effects that are not directly encoded into the placement algorithm but stem from its collective dynamics.",

In GraphStep, algorithms are expressed directly without requiring the programmer to explicitly manage parallel synchronization, operation ordering, placement, or scheduling details. Problems in the sparse graph domain are usually highly concurrent and communicate along graph edges. Exposing concurrency and communication structure allows scheduling of parallel operations and management of communication that is necessary for performance on a spatial computer. We study the performance of a semantic network application, a shortest-path application, and a max-flow/min-cut application. We introduce a language syntax for GraphStep applications. The total speedup over sequential versions of the applications studied ranges from a factor of 19 to a factor of 15,000. Spatially-aware graph optimizations (e.g., node decomposition, placement and route scheduling) delivered speedups from 3 to 30 times over a spatially-oblivious mapping.",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneities (heterogeneous characteristics) are intrinsic in dynamic and autonomous networks, and may be caused by the following factors: finite nodes, structured network graph, mutation of node's strategy and topological view, and dynamic linking, and so on. However, few works systematically investigate the effect of the intrinsic heterogeneities on the evolutionary dynamics of incentive mechanisms in autonomous networks. In this article, we thoroughly discuss this interesting problem. Specifically, this article respectively models the pairwise interaction between peers as PD (prisoner's dilemma)-like game and multiple peers' interactions as public-goods game, proposes a general analytical framework for dynamics in evolutionary game theory (EGT)-based incentive mechanisms, and draws the following conclusions. First, for explicit incentive mechanisms, due to heterogeneity, it is impossible to get the static equilibrium of absolutely-full-cooperation (or state that provides service to the networks—so-called reciprocation), but, on the other hand, heterogeneity can facilitate reciprocation evolution, and drive the whole system into almost-full-reciprocation state, that is, most of the system time would be occupied by the full reciprocation state. Second, even without any explicit incentive mechanisms, simultaneous coevolution between dynamic linking and peers' rational strategies can not only facilitate the cooperation evolution, but drive the network structure into the desirable small-world structure. The philosophical implication of our work is that simplicity and homogeneity are too idealized for incentive mechanisms in autonomous networks—diversity and heterogeneity are intrinsic for any incentive mechanism that is compatible with the essence of our real society. Diversity is everywhere.",

    "abstract": "In multiagent systems, social optimality is a desirable goal to achieve in terms of maximizing the global efficiency of the system. We study the problem of coordinating on socially optimal outcomes among a population of agents, in which each agent randomly interacts with another agent from the population each round. Previous work [Hales and Edmonds 2003; Matlock and Sen 2007, 2009] mainly resorts to modifying the interaction protocol from random interaction to tag-based interactions and only focus on the case of symmetric games. Besides, in previous work the agents’ decision making processes are usually based on evolutionary learning, which usually results in high communication cost and high deviation on the coordination rate. To solve these problems, we propose an alternative social learning framework with two major contributions as follows. First, we introduce the observation mechanism to reduce the amount of communication required among agents. Second, we propose that the agents’ learning strategies should be based on reinforcement learning technique instead of evolutionary learning. Each agent explicitly keeps the record of its current state in its learning strategy, and learn its optimal policy for each state independently. In this way, the learning performance is much more stable and also it is suitable for both symmetric and asymmetric games. The performance of this social learning framework is extensively evaluated under the testbed of two-player general-sum games comparing with previous work [Hao and Leung 2011; Matlock and Sen 2007]. The influences of different factors on the learning performance of the social learning framework are investigated as well.",

This class of application will have a multilayer architecture, where each layer is likely to use languages and technologies appropriate to its own concerns. An example application is a geographically large-scale crisis management system. Typically, such applications are required to dynamically adapt their behavior based on current circumstances, with adaptations potentially affecting all layers of the application. The complexities involved in dynamically adapting multilayer applications will significantly benefit from formal approaches to its specification. This article presents a new methodology for flexible, multilayer application adaptation, with layer-specific adaptation solution templates bound to application mismatches that are organized into hierarchical taxonomies. Templates can be linked either through direct invocations or through adaptation events, supporting flexible cross-layer adaptation. The methodology illustrates the use of different formalisms for different elements of its specification. In particular, we combine semiformal metamodeling techniques for the system model specification with formal Petri nets, which are used to capture template matchmaking using reachability analysis. This work demonstrates how existing formalisms can be used for the specification of a generic adaptation model for pervasive applications.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a scheme, named CoRAD , for the reestablishment of lost connectivity using sensor nodes with adjustable communication range in stationary wireless sensor networks (WSNs), when “dumb” behavior occurs some of the nodes. Due to the occurrence of such behavior, there may be temporary loss of connectivity between among the nodes. Such a phenomenon is different from the commonly known node isolation problem in stationary WSNs. The mere activation of intermediate sleep nodes cannot guarantee reestablishment of connectivity, because there may not exist neighbor nodes of the isolated nodes. On the contrary, the increase in communication range of a single sensor node may make it die quickly. Including this, a sensor node has maximum limit of increase in communication range that may not be sufficient to reestablish connectivity. Therefore, considering all these factors for self-organization of the network and isolated node re-connection, we propose a price-based scheme, which addresses the issue by activating intermediate sleep nodes or by adjusting the communication range of some of the other nodes in the network. The scheme also deactivates the additional activated nodes and reduces the increased communication range when the dumb nodes resume their normal behavior, upon the return of favorable environmental conditions. To implement the proposed scheme, CoRAD it is required to construct the network using GPS-enabled adjustable communication range sensor nodes. Through simulation we compare our proposed scheme with the existing topology management schemes -- LETC and A1 -- in the same scenario by considering the number of activated nodes, message overhead, and energy consumption. We find that the proposed scheme shows improved performance compared to the existing topology management schemes.",

In this article, we propose two novel learning strategies under the collective learning framework, collective learning EV-l and collective learning EV-g , to efficiently facilitate the emergence of social norms. Extensive simulations results show that both learning strategies can support the emergence of desirable social norms more efficiently and be applicable in a wider range of multiagent interaction scenarios compared with previous work.

We introduce cognitive features to the ON that allow users' mobile devices to become aware of the surrounding physical environment. Specifically, we exploit cognitive psychology studies on dynamic memory structures and cognitive heuristics, i.e. mental models that describe how the human brain handle decision-making amongst complex and real-time stimuli. Combined with ON, these cognitive features allow devices to act as proxies in the cyber-world of their users and exchange knowledge to deliver awareness of places in an urban environment. This is done through tags associated with locations. They represent features that are perceived by humans about a place. We consider the extent to which this knowledge becomes available to participants, using interactions with locations and other nodes. This is assessed taking into account a wide range of cognitive parameters. Outcomes are important because this functionality could support a new type of recommendation system that is independent of the traditional forms of networking.",

On the other side, they need to evolve, often in a continuous fashion, to meet changing needs, to offer new functionalities, or also to fix emerging failures. To make the picture even more complex, these systems rarely work in isolation and often need to collaborate with other systems, as well as humans. All such facets call for moving their validation during operation, as offered by approaches called testing in the field. In this article, we observe that even the field-based testing approaches should change over time to follow and adapt to the changes and evolution of collaborating systems or environments or users’ behaviors.

To address this problem we propose a new interactive access control : servers should interact with clients, asking for missing credentials necessary to grant access, whereas clients may supply or decline the requested credentials. Servers evaluate their policies and interact with clients until a decision of grant or deny is taken. This proposal is grounded in a formal model on policy-based access control. It identifies the formal reasoning services of deduction, abduction and consistency. Based on them, the work proposes a comprehensive access control framework for autonomic systems.

Hutle and Widder [2005a] have shown that there is no deterministic message-driven self-stabilizing implementation of the eventually strong failure detector and thus Ω in systems with uncertainty in message delays and channels of unknown capacity using only bounded space. Under stronger assumptions it was shown that even the eventually perfect failure detector can be implemented in message-driven systems consisting of at least f + 2 processes ( f being the upper bound on the number of processes that crash during an execution). In this article we show that f + 2 is in fact a lower bound in message-driven systems, even if nonstabilizing algorithms are considered. This contrasts time-driven models where f + 1 is sufficient for failure detector implementations. Moreover, we investigate algorithms where not all processes send message, that is, are active, but some (in a predetermined set) remain passive. Here, we show that the f + 2 processes required for message-driven systems must be active, while in time-driven systems it suffices that f processes are active. We also provide message-driven implementations of Ω. Our algorithms are efficient in the sense that not all processes have to send messages forever, which is an improvement to previous message-driven failure detector implementations.",

    "abstract": "Design and verification of Self-Stabilizing (SS) network protocols are difficult tasks in part because of the convergence property that requires an SS protocol to recover to a set of legitimate states from any state in its state space. Once an SS protocol reaches a legitimate state, it remains in the set of legitimate states as long as there are no faults, called the closure property. Distribution issues exacerbate the design complexity of SS protocols as processes should collaborate and take local actions that result in global convergence. Most existing design techniques are manual, and mainly focus on protocols whose global state can be corrected if the local states of all processes are corrected, called the locally correctable protocols. After manual design, an SS protocol has to be verified for closure and convergence. Previous work observes that verifying SS protocols is a harder problem than designing them as developers have to ensure the correctness of closure and convergence functionalities and their noninterference. An algorithmic method for the design of convergence generates protocols that are correct by construction, thereby eliminating the need for verification. In order to facilitate the design of SS protocols, this article presents a lightweight method for algorithmic addition of convergence to finite-state nonstabilizing protocols, including nonlocally correctable protocols. The proposed method enables the reuse of design efforts in the development of different self-stabilizing protocols. Moreover, for the first time (to the best of our knowledge), this article presents an algorithmic method for the addition of convergence to symmetric protocols that consist of structurally similar processes. The proposed approach is supported by a software tool that automatically adds convergence to nonstabilizing protocols. We have used the proposed method/tool to automatically generate several self-stabilizing protocols with up to 40 processes (and 3 40 states) in a few minutes on a regular PC. Surprisingly, our tool has synthesized both protocols that are the same as their manually designed versions as well as alternative solutions for well-known problems in the literature (e.g., Dijkstra’s token ring, maximal matching, graph coloring, agreement and leader election in a ring). Moreover, the proposed method has helped us detect a design flaw in a manually designed self-stabilizing protocol.",

These features have a specific role which helps in improving the performance of DE. While OBL helps in giving a good initial start to DE, the use of the tournament best base vector in the mutation phase helps in preserving the diversity. Finally the single population structure helps in faster convergence. Their synergized effect balances the exploitation and exploration capabilities of DE without compromising with the solution quality or the convergence rate. The proposed MDE is validated on a set of 25 standard benchmark problems, 7 nontraditional shifted benchmark functions proposed at the special session of CEC2008, and three engineering design problems. Numerical results and statistical analysis show that the proposed MDE is better than or at least comparable to the basic DE and several other state-of-the art DE variants.",

Service composition techniques are usually designed as an extension to service discovery. Traditional techniques try to match a user’s requirements, often complex, with the available services. However, one-to-one matching is inefficient; it is preferable to meet the request from available services even when one of the basic services is not present. Separating composition and discovery has also led to inefficiency, especially in a highly dynamic environment. With the heterogeneity of networks, users, and applications having multiple sources, constructing service-specific overlays in large distributed networks is challenging. In this article, we propose a new service composition algorithm to deal with the problem of composing multiple autonomic elements to achieve system-wide goals. Using a self-organizing approach, autonomic entities are dynamically and seamlessly composed into service-specific overlay networks. The algorithm combines composition and service discovery into one step, thereby achieving more efficiency and less latency. The decentralized and self-organizing nature of the algorithm allows it to respond rapidly to system changes.

This is so because, in the real world, there can be several physical tasks that use shared resources that need to be executed concurrently. In this article, we propose a mechanism to solve this issue of ordering task executions within a CPS that inherently handles mutual exclusion. The mechanism caters to a decentralized and distributed CPS comprising nodes such as computers, robots, and sensor nodes and uses mobile software agents that knit through them to aid the execution of the various tasks while also ensuring mutual exclusion of shared resources. The computations, communications, and control are achieved through these mobile agents. Physical execution of the tasks is performed by the robots in an asynchronous and pipelined manner without the use of a clock. The mechanism also features addition and deletion of tasks and insertion and removal of robots facilitating On-The-Fly Programming . As an application, a Warehouse Management System as a CPS has been implemented. The article concludes with the results and discussions on using the mechanism in both emulated and real-world environments.",

    "abstract": "Self-adaptation can be realized in various ways. Rule-based approaches prescribe the adaptation to be executed if the system or environment satisfies certain conditions. They result in scalable solutions but often with merely satisfying adaptation decisions. In contrast, utility-driven approaches determine optimal decisions by using an often costly optimization, which typically does not scale for large problems. We propose a rule-based and utility-driven adaptation scheme that achieves the benefits of both directions such that the adaptation decisions are optimal, whereas the computation scales by avoiding an expensive optimization. We use this adaptation scheme for architecture-based self-healing of large software systems. For this purpose, we define the utility for large dynamic architectures of such systems based on patterns that define issues the self-healing must address. Moreover, we use pattern-based adaptation rules to resolve these issues. Using a pattern-based scheme to define the utility and adaptation rules allows us to compute the impact of each rule application on the overall utility and to realize an incremental and efficient utility-driven self-healing. In addition to formally analyzing the computational effort and optimality of the proposed scheme, we thoroughly demonstrate its scalability and optimality in terms of reward in comparative experiments with a static rule-based approach as a baseline and a utility-driven approach using a constraint solver. These experiments are based on different failure profiles derived from real-world failure logs. We also investigate the impact of different failure profile characteristics on the scalability and reward to evaluate the robustness of the different approaches.",

These two hypotheses are the cornerstones of the Dynamic Incremental Associative Neural NEtwork (DIANNE) developed as a tailored solution to preference learning in a pervasive environment. DIANNE has been evaluated in two ways: first, by applying it to benchmark datasets to test DIANNE's performance and scalability as a machine learning solution; second, by end-users in live trials to determine the validity of the proposed hypotheses and to evaluate DIANNE's utility as a preference learning solution.",

An important open research issue refers to group norms, that is, norms that govern groups of agents. Depending on the interpretation, group norms may be intended to affect the group as a whole, each member of a group, or some members of the group. Moreover, upholding group norms may require coordination among the members of the group. We have identified three sets of agents affected by group norms, namely, (i) the addressees of the norm, (ii) those that will act on it, and (iii) those that are responsible for ensuring norm compliance. We present a formalism to represent these, connecting it to a minimalist agent organisation model. We use our formalism to develop a reasoning mechanism that enables agents to identify their position with respect to a group norm to further support agent autonomy and coordination when deciding on possible courses of action.",

The potential for conflict between agent goals and norms makes decision making challenging, in that it requires looking ahead to consider the longer-term consequences of which goal to satisfy or which norm to comply with in face of conflict. We therefore seek to determine the actions an agent should select at each point in time, taking account of its temporal goals, norms, and their conflicts. We propose a solution in which a normative planning problem is the basis for practical reasoning based on argumentation. Various types of conflict within goals, within norms, and between goals and norms are identified based on temporal properties of these entities. The properties of the best plan(s) with respect to goal achievement and norm compliance are mapped to arguments, followed by mapping their conflicts to attack between arguments, all of which are used to identify why a plan is justified.",

    "abstract": "Node localization is a fundamental requirement in underwater sensor networks (UWSNs) due to the ineptness of GPS and other terrestrial localization techniques in the underwater environment. In any UWSN monitoring application, the sensed information produces a better result when it is tagged with location information. However, the deployed nodes in UWSNs are vulnerable to many attacks, and hence, can be compromised by interested parties to generate incorrect location information. Consequently, using the existing localization schemes, the deployed nodes are unable to autonomously estimate the precise location information. In this regard, similar existing schemes for terrestrial wireless sensor networks are not applicable to UWSNs due to its inherent mobility, limited bandwidth availability, strict energy constraints, and high bit-error rates. In this article, we propose SecRET , a &lt;underline&gt;Sec&lt;/underline&gt;ure &lt;underline&gt;R&lt;/underline&gt;ange-based localization scheme empowered by &lt;underline&gt;E&lt;/underline&gt;vidence &lt;underline&gt;T&lt;/underline&gt;heory for UWSNs. With trust-based computations, the proposed scheme, SecRET , enables the unlocalized nodes to select the most reliable set of anchors with low resource consumption. Thus, the proposed scheme is adaptive to many attacks in UWSN environment. NS-3 based performance evaluation indicates that SecRET maintains energy-efficiency of the deployed nodes while ensuring efficient and secure localization, despite the presence of compromised nodes under various attacks.",

    "abstract": "Many software systems today face uncertain operating conditions, such as sudden changes in the availability of resources or unexpected user behavior. Without proper mitigation these uncertainties can jeopardize the system goals. Self-adaptation is a common approach to tackle such uncertainties. When the system goals may be compromised, the self-adaptive system has to select the best adaptation option to reconfigure by analyzing the possible adaptation options, i.e., the adaptation space. Yet, analyzing large adaptation spaces using rigorous methods can be resource- and time-consuming, or even be infeasible. One approach to tackle this problem is by using online machine learning to reduce adaptation spaces. However, existing approaches require domain expertise to perform feature engineering to define the learner and support online adaptation space reduction only for specific goals. To tackle these limitations, we present “Deep Learning for Adaptation Space Reduction Plus”—DLASeR+ for short. DLASeR+ offers an extendable learning framework for online adaptation space reduction that does not require feature engineering, while supporting three common types of adaptation goals: threshold, optimization, and set-point goals. We evaluate DLASeR+ on two instances of an Internet-of-Things application with increasing sizes of adaptation spaces for different combinations of adaptation goals. We compare DLASeR+ with a baseline that applies exhaustive analysis and two state-of-the-art approaches for adaptation space reduction that rely on learning. Results show that DLASeR+ is effective with a negligible effect on the realization of the adaptation goals compared to an exhaustive analysis approach and supports three common types of adaptation goals beyond the state-of-the-art approaches.",

When reliant on deep learning, these systems need to address the reliability, robustness, and interpretability of learning models. In addition to developing strategies to address these concerns, appropriate software architectures are needed to coordinate LECs and ensure they deliver acceptable behavior even under uncertain conditions. This work describes Anunnaki, a model-driven framework comprising loosely-coupled modular services designed to monitor and manage LECs with respect to Trusted AI assurance concerns when faced with different sources of uncertainty. More specifically, the Anunnaki framework supports the composition of independent, modular services to assess and improve the resilience and robustness of AI systems. The design of Annunaki was guided by several key software engineering principles (e.g., modularity, composability, and reusability) in order to facilitate its use and maintenance to support different aggregate monitoring and assurance analysis tools for LESs and their respective data sets. We demonstrate Anunnaki on two autonomous platforms, a terrestrial rover, and an unmanned aerial vehicle. Our studies show how Anunnaki can be used to manage the operations of different autonomous learning-enabled systems with vision-based LECs while exposed to uncertain environmental conditions.",

In this context, this paper proposes a hierarchical model based on the computational experiments method, which consists of four layers (i.e., L1, L2, L3 and L4) modeling the autonomous, evolutionary, interactive, and emergent features respectively from adaptive agent to AI society. Additionally, taking intelligent transportation system as an example, a computational experiments system is constructed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. This model builds a bridge between complex feature modeling and various technologies, thereby offering theoretical support for further research in complex adaptive systems.",

However, aggressive power assignment at non-leaf nodes, although conserving more energy, results in multicast trees that suffer from higher hop count and jeopardizes delay-sensitive applications, signifying a clear tradeoff between energy efficiency and delay. This article formulates these issues as a constrained Steiner tree problem, and describes a distributed constrained Steiner tree algorithm, which jointly conserves energy and bounds delay for multicast routing in ad hoc networks. In particular, the proposed algorithm concurrently constructs a constrained Steiner tree, performs transmission power assignment at non-leaf nodes, and strives to minimize the sum of transmission power of non-leaf nodes, subject to the given maximum hop count constraint. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and reveal the characteristics of the proposed algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, Web Services (WS) play an important role in the dissemination and distributed processing of large amounts of data that become available on the Web. In many cases, it is essential to retrieve and process such data in blocks, in order to benefit from pipelined parallelism and reduced communication costs. This article deals with the problem of minimizing at runtime, in a self-managing way, the total response time of a call to a database exposed to a volatile environment, like the Grid, as a WS. Typically, in this scenario, response time exhibits a concave, nonlinear behavior depending on the client-controlled size of the individual requests comprising a fixed size task. In addition, no accurate profiling or internal state information is available, and the optimum point is volatile. This situation is encountered in several systems, such as WS Management Systems (WSMS) for DBMS-like data management over wide area service-based networks, and the widely spread OGSA-DAI WS for accessing and integrating traditional DBMS. The main challenges in this problem apart from the unavailability of a model, include the presence of noise, which incurs local minima, the volatility of the environment, which results in moving optimum operating point, and the requirements for fast convergence to the optimal size of the request from the side of the client rather than of the server, and for low overshooting. Two solutions are presented in this work, which fall into the broader areas of runtime optimization and switching extremum control. They incorporate heuristics to avoid local optimal points, and address all the aforementioned challenges. The effectiveness of the solutions is verified via both empirical evaluation in real cases and simulations, which show that significant performance benefits can be provided rendering obsolete the need for detailed profiling of the WS.",

We propose a method to be used by each moving object to prioritize data items based on their probabilities of being new to future receivers.

    "abstract": "Many applications associated with live business intelligence are written as complex data analysis programs defined by directed acyclic graphs of MapReduce jobs, for example, using Pig, Hive, or Scope frameworks. An increasing number of these applications have additional requirements for completion time guarantees. In this article, we consider the popular Pig framework that provides a high-level SQL-like abstraction on top of MapReduce engine for processing large data sets. There is a lack of performance models and analysis tools for automated performance management of such MapReduce jobs. We offer a performance modeling environment for Pig programs that automatically profiles jobs from the past runs and aims to solve the following inter-related problems: (i) estimating the completion time of a Pig program as a function of allocated resources; (ii) estimating the amount of resources (a number of map and reduce slots) required for completing a Pig program with a given (soft) deadline. First, we design a basic performance model that accurately predicts completion time and required resource allocation for a Pig program that is defined as a sequence of MapReduce jobs: predicted completion times are within 10% of the measured ones. Second, we optimize a Pig program execution by enforcing the optimal schedule of its concurrent jobs. For DAGs with concurrent jobs, this optimization helps reducing the program completion time: 10%--27% in our experiments. Moreover, it eliminates possible nondeterminism of concurrent jobs’ execution in the Pig program, and therefore, enables a more accurate performance model for Pig programs. Third, based on these optimizations, we propose a refined performance model for Pig programs with concurrent jobs. The proposed approach leads to significant resource savings (20%--60% in our experiments) compared with the original, unoptimized solution. We validate our solution using a 66-node Hadoop cluster and a diverse set of workloads: PigMix benchmark, TPC-H queries, and customized queries mining a collection of HP Labs’ web proxy logs.",

DETect relies on the feedback that occurs from the system level (macro) to the agent level (micro) when emergence occurs. This feedback constrains agents at the micro level and results in changes occurring in the relationship between an agent and its environment. DETect uses statistical methods to automatically select the properties of the agent and environment to monitor and tracks the relationship between these properties over time. When a significant change is detected, the algorithm uses distributed consensus to determine if a sufficient number of agents have simultaneously experienced a similar change. On agreement of emergence, DETect raises an event, which its agent or other interested observers can use to act appropriately. The approach is evaluated using a multi-agent case study.",

    "abstract": "It is a recurring requirement in open systems, such as networks, distributed systems, and socio-technical systems, that a group of agents must coordinate their behaviour for the common good. In those systems—where agents are heterogeneous—unexpected behaviour can occur due to errors or malice. Agents whose practices free-ride the system can be accepted to a certain level; however, not only do they put the stability of the system at risk, but they also compromise the agents that behave according to the system’s rules. In social systems, it has been observed that social capital is an attribute of individuals that enhances their ability to solve collective action problems. Sociologists have studied collective action through human societies and observed that social capital plays an important role in maintaining communities though time as well as in simplifying the decision-making in them. In this work, we explore the use of Electronic Social Capital for optimising self-organised collective action. We developed a context-independent Electronic Social Capital framework to test this hypothesis. The framework comprises a set of handlers that capture events from the system and update three different forms of social capital: trustworthiness, networks, and institutions. Later, a set of metrics are generated by the forms of social capital and used for decision-making. The framework was tested in different scenarios such as two-player games, n -player games, and public goods games. The experimental results show that social capital optimises the outcomes (in terms of long-term satisfaction and utility), reduces the complexity of decision-making, and scales with the size of the population. This work proposes an alternative solution using Electronic Social Capital to represent and reason with qualitative, instead of traditional quantitative, values. This solution could be embedded into socio-technical systems to incentivise collective action without commodifying the resources or actions in the system.",

In particular, our focus is on emerging cloud ecosystems wherein we expect tenants to modify their demands strategically in response to such modulation in effective capacity and prices. Toward this, we consider a simple model of a cloud provider that offers a single type of virtual machine to its tenants and devise a leader/follower game-based cloud control framework to capture the interactions between the provider and its tenants. We assume both parties employ myopic control and short-term predictions to reflect their operation under the high dynamism and poor predictability in such environments. Our evaluation using a combination of real data center traces and real-world benchmarks hosted on a prototype OpenStack-based cloud shows 10% to 30% profit improvement for a cloud provider compared with baselines that use static pricing and/or static effective capacity.",

    "abstract": "Many instances of socio-technical systems in the digital society and digital economy require some form of self-governance. Examples include community energy systems, peer production systems, participatory sensing applications, and shared management of communal living areas or workspace. Such systems have several features in common, of which three are that they are rule-oriented , self-organising, and value-sensitive , and in operation, this combination of features entails self-modification of the rules in order to satisfice a changeable set of values. This presents a fundamental dilemma for systems design. On the one hand, the system must be sufficiently unrestricted (resilient, flexible) to enable a diverse group but with a shared set of congruent values to achieve their joint purposes in collective action situations. On the other hand, it must be sufficiently restricted (stable, robust) to prevent a subset of the group from exploiting self-determination ‘against itself’ and usurp control of the system for the benefit of its own narrow interests. To address this problem, we consider a study of classical Athenian democracy which investigates how the governance model of the city-state flourished. The work suggests that exceptional knowledge management , i.e., making information available for socially productive purposes, played a crucial role in sustaining its democracy for nearly 200 years, by creating processes for aggregation, alignment, and codification of knowledge. We therefore examine the proposition that some properties can be generalised to resolve the rule-restriction dilemma by establishing a set of design principles intended to make knowledge management processes open, inclusive, transparent, and effective in self-governed social technical systems. We operationalise three of these principles in the context of a collective action situation, namely self-organised common-pool resource allocation, and present the results of a series of experiments showing how knowledge management processes can be used to obtain robust solutions for the perception of fairness, allocation decision, and punishment mechanisms. By applying this operationalisation of the design principles for knowledge management processes as a complement to institutional approaches to governance, we demonstrate empirically how it can satisfice shared values, distribute power fairly, and apply “common sense” in dealing with rule violations. We conclude by arguing that this approach to the design of socio-technical systems can provide a balance between restricted and unrestricted self-modification of conventional rules, and can thus provide the foundations for sustainable and democratic self-governance in socio-technical systems.",

    "abstract": "In a decentralized storage system, agents replicate each other’s data to increase availability. Compared to organizationally centralized solutions, such as cloud storage, a decentralized storage system requires less trust in the provider and may result in smaller monetary costs. Our system is based on reciprocal storage contracts that allow the agents to adopt to changes in their replication partners’ availability (by dropping inefficient contracts and forming new contracts with other partners). The data availability provided by the system is a function of the participating agents’ availability. However, a straightforward system in which agents’ matching is decentralized uses the given agent availability inefficiently. As agents are autonomous, the highly available agents form cliques replicating data between each other, which makes the system too hostile for the weakly available newcomers. In contrast, a centralized, equitable matching is not incentive compatible: it does not reward users for keeping their software running. We solve this dilemma by a mixed solution: an “adoption” mechanism in which highly available agents donate some replication space, which in turn is used to help the worst-off agents. We show that the adoption motivates agents to increase their availability (is incentive-compatible), but also that it is sufficient for acceptable data availability for weakly-available agents.",

To set up such an application, the distributed components require spontaneous composition. Since dynamics in the environment and device failures may imply the unavailability of components and devices at any time, finding, maintaining, and adapting such a composition is a nontrivial task. Moreover, the speed of such a configuration process directly influences the user since in the event of a configuration, the user has to wait. In this article, we introduce configuration algorithms for homogeneous and heterogeneous environments. We discuss a comprehensive approach to pervasive application configuration that adapts to the characteristics of the environment: It chooses the most efficient configuration method for the given environment to minimize the configuration latency. Moreover, we propose a new scheme for caching and reusing partial application configurations. This scheme reduces the configuration latency even further such that a configuration can be executed without notable disturbance of the user.",

    "abstract": "Traditional network anomaly detection involves developing models that rely on packet inspection. However, increasing network speeds and use of encrypted protocols make per-packet inspection unsuited for today’s networks. One method of overcoming this obstacle is aggregating packet header information and performing flow-based analysis where data flow patterns are examined rather than deep packet inspection. Many existing approaches are special purpose limited to detecting specific behavior. Also, the data reduction inherent in identifying anomalous flows hinders alert correlation. In this article, we propose and develop a dynamic anomaly detection approach for augmented network flows. We sketch network state during flow creation, enabling general-purpose threat detection. We describe an efficient flow augmentation approach based on the count-min sketch that provides per-flow-, per-node-, and per-network-level statistics parallel to flow record generation. We design and develop a support vector machine-based adaptive anomaly detection and correlation mechanism, which is capable of aggregating alerts without a priori alert classification and evolving models online. We further develop a lightweight evolving alert aggregation method and combine it with a confidence forwarding mechanism identifying a small percentage predictions for additional processing. We show effectiveness of our methods on both enterprise and backbone traces. Experimental results demonstrate its ability to maintain high accuracy without the need for offline training.",

    "abstract": "Today’s system developers and operators face the challenge of creating software systems that make efficient use of dynamically allocated resources under highly variable and dynamic load profiles, while at the same time delivering reliable performance. Autonomic controllers, for example, an advanced autoscaling mechanism in a cloud computing context, can benefit from an abstracted load model as knowledge to reconfigure on time and precisely. Existing workload characterization approaches have limited support to capture variations in the interarrival times of incoming work units over time (i.e., a variable load profile). For example, industrial and scientific benchmarks support constant or stepwise increasing load, or interarrival times defined by statistical distributions or recorded traces. These options show shortcomings either in representative character of load variation patterns or in abstraction and flexibility of their format. In this article, we present the Descartes Load Intensity Model (DLIM) approach addressing these issues. DLIM provides a modeling formalism for describing load intensity variations over time. A DLIM instance is a compact formal description of a load intensity trace. DLIM-based tools provide features for benchmarking, performance, and recorded load intensity trace analysis. As manually obtaining and maintaining DLIM instances becomes time consuming, we contribute three automated extraction methods and devised metrics for comparison and method selection. We discuss how these features are used to enhance system management approaches for adaptations during runtime, and how they are integrated into simulation contexts and enable benchmarking of elastic or adaptive behavior. We show that automatically extracted DLIM instances exhibit an average modeling error of 15.2% over 10 different real-world traces that cover between 2 weeks and 7 months. These results underline DLIM model expressiveness. In terms of accuracy and processing speed, our proposed extraction methods for the descriptive models are comparable to existing time series decomposition methods. Additionally, we illustrate DLIM applicability by outlining approaches of workload modeling in systems engineering that employ or rely on our proposed load intensity modeling formalism.",

    "abstract": "Software systems are deployed in environments that keep changing over time. They should therefore adapt to changing conditions to meet their requirements. The satisfaction rate of these requirements depends on the rate at which adverse conditions prevent their satisfaction. Obstacle analysis is a goal-oriented form of risk analysis for requirements engineering (RE), whereby obstacles to system goals are identified, assessed, and resolved through countermeasures. The selection of effective countermeasures relies on environment assumptions and on the assessed likelihood and criticality of the corresponding obstacles. Those various factors estimated at RE time may, however, evolve at system runtime. To meet the system’s goals under changing conditions, this article proposes to defer obstacle resolution to system runtime. Techniques are presented for monitoring obstacle satisfaction rates; deciding when adaptation should be triggered; and adapting the system on-the-fly to countermeasures that are more effective. The approach relies on a model where goals and obstacles are refined and specified in a probabilistic linear temporal logic. The techniques allow for monitoring the satisfaction rate of probabilistic leaf obstacles; determining the severity of obstacle consequences on goal satisfaction rates computed from the monitored obstacle satisfaction rates; and shifting to countermeasures that better meet the required goal satisfaction rates. Our approach is evaluated on fragments of an ambulance dispatching system.",

In this paper we propose a Just-in-Time LEarning-based Adaptive Parameter tuning (JIT-LEAP) algorithm that adapts the CSMA/CA parameter setting to the time-varying operating conditions by also exploiting the past history to find the most appropriate setting for the current conditions. Following the approach of active adaptive algorithms, the adaptation mechanism of JIT-LEAP is triggered by a change detection test only when needed (i.e., in response to a change in the operating conditions).

We consider a setting where not only the member agents are adaptive but also the multi-agent system viewed as an entity in its own right is adaptive. Specifically, the social structure of a multi-agent system can be reflected in the social norms among its members. It is well recognized that the norms that arise in society are not always beneficial to its members. We focus on prosocial norms, which help achieve positive outcomes for society and often provide guidance to agents to act in a manner that takes into account the welfare of others. Specifically, we propose Cha, a framework for the emergence of prosocial norms. Unlike previous norm emergence approaches, Cha supports continual change to a system (agents may enter and leave) and dynamism (norms may change when the environment changes). Importantly, Cha agents incorporate prosocial decision-making based on inequity aversion theory, reflecting an intuition of guilt arising from being antisocial. In this manner, Cha brings together two important themes in prosociality: decision-making by individuals and fairness of system-level outcomes. We demonstrate via simulation that Cha can improve aggregate societal gains and fairness of outcomes.",

This article revisits and extends prior work that advocates structurally flexible controllers, as ensembles of micro-controllers each providing specific services. We experimented with our approach with three different architectural configurations for the controller: monolithic, decentralised, and decentralised with a meta-controller. Our results indicate that despite the decentralised configuration with a meta-controller demanding more computational resources, it performed comparatively well compared to the other configurations, including when measuring the target system’s response time. Moreover, we found that variations of the control loop timing at the different layers of the controller impact the stability of the target system. We have also evolved the controller by adding a new micro-controller, which caused no impact on the other micro-controllers, and mostly kept the target system’s performance. We conclude that a multi-layered controller design, based on micro-controllers, provides the basis for defining structurally flexible controllers at operational-time, and may promote reuse at development-time.",

It aims to deal with critical event scenarios using BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) logic criteria and prioritizing the timely uploading of data-driven information towards the destination. SANLR of VoI is developed to reduce energy consumption, end-to-end latency, jitter, and improve Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) in underwater communication networks. VoI SANLR introduces principles of priority-based methods and intends to address challenges in terms of underwater environment such as varying channel conditions, lack energy resources, and real-time decision requirements by using SANLR. Energy optimization analysis reveals consistent outperformance, achieving a remarkable 95% reduction in energy consumption compared to other techniques. Low latency is maintained, ranging from 2.5 to 0.5 seconds, showcasing enhanced efficiency and scalability. VoI SANLR demonstrates exceptional performance in both throughput and jitter. It achieves the highest data transfer rates, ranging from 100 kbps to 110 kbps, indicating outstanding efficiency. Additionally, the jitter remains consistently low, between 1.8 ms and 2 ms, ensuring minimal delay variability and improved communication stability. PDR consistently surpasses other techniques, reaching a maximum of 99%.

DSADA receives the outcomes of the object detection algorithm along with the corresponding LiDAR point clouds for each scene.

A relevant source of synchronisation errors, especially in heavy-duty applications and harsh environments, is given by temperature variations that affect the quartz oscillators. This paper takes a control theory-based approach and proposes to augment clock synchronisation schemes – that are typically feedback-based – with a feedforward compensation path using temperature measurements to quickly react to temperature change. Unlike previous approaches relying on per-device data, our solution takes advantage of the combined feedforward-feedback nature of the control scheme to perform compensation using only nominal crystal parameters. When implemented in conjunction with the FLOPSYNC-2 feedback-based clock synchronisation scheme and tested both in simulation and experimentally, the approach resulted in a greatly reduced synchronisation error during temperature transients. In detail, Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed solution can reduce the peak clock synchronisation error on average by 5.3 \\(\\times\\) and in the worst case by 2.2 \\(\\times\\) , thus proving applicable and effective without the need for a costly per-device calibration. When tested experimentally on a network of sensor nodes, a 3.3 \\(\\times\\) peak clock synchronisation error improvement was observed, confirming the simulation predictions.",

These methods typically address uncertain quality attributes embedded within system models by adjusting model parameters. However, the uncertainty related to selecting a specific system model over plausible alternatives has received limited attention. Our work focuses on self-adaptation, exploring methods to tackle uncertainty in model selection. This includes scenarios where one model is chosen over competing alternatives to encapsulate the system’s understanding and anticipate future observations. Our proposed solution augments the conventional feedback loop of self-adaptive systems by combining Bayesian model averaging to mitigate uncertainty and many-objective optimization to take into account multiple, possibly many, dependability requirements at the same time. We carry out an empirical evaluation to study the effectiveness, cost, and scalability of the proposed approach using two case studies with increasing structural complexity and number of dependability requirements. Results show that our approach based on model averaging is significantly better than model selection in terms of satisfied requirements after adaptation (adaptation success frequency). We also show that our approach can deal with large model spaces ( \\(\\sim\\!10^{19}\\) ) using efficient sampling methods rather than exhaustive model space exploration.",

This has generated in a large amount of distributed data, leading to new prospects for deep learning. However, this data is confined within data silos and contains sensitive information, making it difficult to be processed in a centralized manner, particularly under stringent data privacy regulations. Federated learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling collaborative learning while ensuring privacy. Nonetheless, data and device heterogeneity complicate FL implementation. This research presents a specialized FL algorithm for heterogeneous edge computing. It integrates a lightweight grouping strategy for homogeneous devices, a scheduling algorithm within groups, and a Split Learning (SL) approach. These contributions enhance model accuracy and training speed, alleviate the burden on resource-constrained devices, and strengthen privacy. Experimental results demonstrate that the GSFL outperforms FedAvg and SplitFed by 6.53× and 1.18×. Under experimental conditions with \\(\\alpha=0.05\\) , representing a highly heterogeneous data distribution typical of extreme Non-IID scenarios, GSFL showed better accuracy compared to FedAvg by 10.64%, HACCS by 4.53%, and Cluster-HSFL by 1.16%.

    "abstract": "Microservice architectures are increasingly used to modularize IoT applications and deploy them in distributed and heterogeneous edge computing environments. Over time, these microservice-based IoT applications are susceptible to performance anomalies caused by resource hogging (e.g., CPU or memory), resource contention, etc., which can negatively impact their Quality of Service and violate their Service Level Agreements. Existing research on performance anomaly detection for edge computing environments focuses on model training approaches that either achieve high accuracy at the expense of a time-consuming and resource-intensive training process or prioritize training efficiency at the cost of lower accuracy. To address this gap, while considering the resource constraints and the large number of devices in modern edge platforms, we propose two clustering-based model training approaches: (1) intra-cluster parameter transfer learning-based model training (ICPTL) and (2) cluster-level model training (CM). These approaches aim to find a trade-off between the training efficiency of anomaly detection models and their accuracy. We compared the models trained under ICPTL and CM to models trained for specific devices (most accurate, least efficient) and a single general model trained for all devices (least accurate, most efficient). Our findings show that ICPTL’s model accuracy is comparable to that of the model per device approach while requiring only 40% of the training time. In addition, CM further improves training efficiency by requiring 23% less training time and reducing the number of trained models by approximately 66% compared to ICPTL, yet achieving a higher accuracy than a single general model.",

This suggested Comp-TSSs enhances vehicular network security by incorporating reconstruction and regularization statistic terms derived from TPCA, which is extended from PCA through a fresh perspective of fully diagonalizing the covariance tensor. Comp-TSSs effectively captures multi-dimensional correlations in vehicular network volume data, providing complementary measures for representation residuals and weighted distances of instances projected in the principal tensor subspace.

Our study fills this gap by comprehensively investigating the vulnerabilities of two widely used RGB image-based 2D SS models ( DeepLabV3 and DeepLabV3+ ) against three inference attacks: membership inference, attribute inference, and model inversion. We evaluate the attack effectiveness on three backbones (MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and ResNet101) across three datasets (VOC2012, CityScapes, and ADE20K), where the attack accuracy can reach up to 95% (membership inference), 40% (attribute inference), and 70% (model inversion), revealing that deeper networks are more prone to privacy leakage in inference attacks. Consequently, we introduce differential privacy and model pruning as defensive mechanisms, significantly reducing attack performance, where the average accuracy drops 20% among the three inference attacks. Our findings reveal critical privacy vulnerabilities in SS tasks and offer practical guidance for developing more robust SS models in autonomous driving.",

In this paper, we put forward a caching-enabled task offloading strategy, by caching and reusing the universal context data at the edge server, to avoid duplicated data transmission in VEC systems. The goal is to minimize the overall response latency for all the tasks, by jointly optimizing task offloading, content caching and resource allocation decisions in VEC. The optimization problem is formulated as a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem. To efficiently solve this problem, we decompose this problem into two subproblems, namely, the computing Resource Allocation (RA) problem and the Joint Offloading and Caching (JOC) problem. The corresponding algorithms are put forward to solve the content caching and task offloading problems, respectively. Numeric evaluation reveals that our strategies and algorithms can achieve better performance in minimizing the overall response latency, in comparison with other approaches.",

    "abstract": "In smart Cyber-Physical Systems (sCPS), a critical challenge lies in task planning under uncertainty. There is a broad body of work in the area with approaches able to individually deal with different classes of constraints (e.g., ordering, structural) and uncertainties (e.g., in sensing, actuation, latencies). However, these uncertainties are rarely independent and often compound, affecting the satisfaction of goals and other system properties in subtle and often unpredictable ways. According to the Uncertainty Interaction Problem recently proposed in the literature, approaches are needed to identify multiple sources of uncertainty and quantify their impact. In this paper we deal with two types of uncertainty present in task-based sCPS, namely temporal availability constraints and element reliability . The former refers to the availability of a given system element required to perform a task, which may be unavailable for certain periods of time, while the latter is related to system elements that may fail at some point with some probability. This paper presents an approach to consider both uncertainties, employing genetic algorithms to incorporate them effectively into planning for deciding how to best adapt the system to changes at run time. Our method is evaluated in the domains of electric vehicle charging and healthcare robotics. Our evaluation shows that: (i) the proposed approach outperforms a baseline mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) algorithm capable of generating optimal solutions in the absence of uncertainty, providing more robust solutions to failures, changes in temporal availability, or both sources of uncertainty combined; (ii) both sources of uncertainty have a strong and compound impact on the quality of the solutions provided; and (iii) the proposed approach significantly reduces computational cost, with respect to the MILP-based optimization.",

    "abstract": "The current era of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has witnessed significant and continuous advancements based on the powerful learning capabilities of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), particularly those featuring convolutional (CONV) layers. In the field of marine ecosystem conservation, these advancements have revolutionized our ability to monitor and protect ocean environments. DNNs, especially those utilizing YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture, have been instrumental in tasks such as real-time marine species identification, tracking of marine mammal migrations, detection of coral bleaching events, and monitoring of illegal fishing activities. These AI-powered tools provide unprecedented insights into marine ecosystems, enabling more timely and effective conservation actions. As we aim further to enhance the computational and storage efficiency of these networks, Tensor Train (TT) decomposition has emerged as a notable compression technique due to its high compression ratio and ability to maintain strong performance. However, the CONV layer in TT format still incurs substantial computational costs, stemming from convolution calculations and the additional multiplication operations intrinsic to TT usage. Consequently, reducing these computational costs is critical to improving the effectiveness of DNNs. To advance the computational efficiency of DNNs, this paper introduces a novel separable TT decomposition that offers an efficient TT-format CONV layer using depthwise separable convolution. Remarkably, this method not only reduces computation costs significantly but also maintains a similar capacity for parameter compression and accuracy compared to the conventional TT-format model. Furthermore, our method facilitates distributed learning based on the factorization of CONV layers. By scheduling the smaller-factored weight tensors, we significantly mitigate the GPU memory requirements of the larger model, thereby enhancing the availability and speed of training. The primary contributions of this paper are twofold: (1) a simultaneous reduction in computational cost and parameter count in TT-based CONV layers, achieved by minimizing TT redundancy and optimizing convolution, leading to up to 7–10× improvements per layer, an overall one-third reduction in parameters, and 15% reduction in FLOPs at the model level. 2) We demonstrate how our approach enables effective distributed learning and resource allocation. By merging TT decomposition and depthwise separable convolution, we present TTDSC, a TT-based depthwise separable convolution approach. This study opens new avenues to improve the efficiency of CONV. layers compression and has significant implications for large-scale deep learning applications.",

    "abstract": "Many operations in workflow systems are dependent on database tables. The classical workflow nets and their extensions (e.g., worflow nets with data) cannot model these operations, so that they cannot find some related errors. Recently, workflow nets with tables (WFT-nets) were proposed to remedy such a flaw. However, existing methods for constructing the reachability graph of the WFT-nets can generate pseudo states because they do not take into account the guards that constrain the enabling and firing of transitions. Additionally, only the soundness property of WFT-nets is considered that represents a single design requirement, while many other requirements, especially those related to tables, cannot be analyzed. In this paper, we re-define the formalism of WFT-nets by augmenting the constraints of guards to them and re-name them as workflow nets with tables and constraints (WFTC-nets). We propose a new method to generate the state reachability graph (SRG) of WFTC-nets such that the SRG can avoid pseudo states by considering the guard constraints. To represent design requirements related to database operations, we define database-oriented computation tree logic (DCTL). We design the model checking algorithms of DCTL based on the SRG of WFTC-nets and develop a tool. Experiments on several public benchmarks show the usefulness of our methods.",

    "abstract": "When intelligent agents act in a stochastic environment, the principle of maximizing expected rewards is used to optimize their policies. The rationality of the maximum rewards becomes a single objective when agents’ decision problems are solved in most cases. This sometimes leads to the agents’ behaviors (the optimal policies for solving the decision problems) that are not legible . In other words, it is difficult for users (or other agents and even humans) to understand the agents’ intentions when they are executing the optimal policies. Hence, it becomes pertinent to consider the legibility of agents’ decision problems. The key challenge lies in formulating a proper legibility function in the problems. Using domain experts’ inputs leans to be subjective and inconsistent in specifying legibility values, and the manual approach quickly becomes infeasible in a complex problem domain. In this article, we aim to learn such a legibility function parallel to developing a (conventional) reward function. We adopt inverse reinforcement learning techniques to automate a legibility function in agents’ decision problems. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the inverse reinforcement learning technique when legibility is solely considered in a decision problem. Things become complicated when both the reward and legibility functions are to be found. We develop a multi-objective inverse reinforcement learning method to automate the two functions in a good balance simultaneously. We vary problem domains in the performance study and provide empirical results in support.",

These contracts enable trustless interactions without the need for intermediaries, as they operate based on predefined rules encoded on the blockchain. However, smart contacts face significant challenges in cross-contract communication and information sharing, making it difficult to establish seamless connectivity and collaboration among CAVs with Web 3.0. In this paper, we propose DeFeed , a novel secure protocol that incorporates various gas-saving functions for CAVs, originated from in-depth research into the interaction among smart contracts for decentralized cross-contract data feed in Web 3.0. DeFeed allows smart contracts to obtain information from other contracts efficiently in a single click, without complicated operations. We judiciously design and complete various functions with DeFeed , including a pool function and a cache function for gas optimization, a subscribe function for facilitating data access, and an update function for the future iteration of our protocol. Tailored for CAVs with Web 3.0 use cases, DeFeed enables efficient data feed between smart contracts underpinning decentralized applications and vehicle coordination. Implemented and tested on the Ethereum official test network, DeFeed demonstrates significant improvements in contract interaction efficiency, reducing computational complexity and gas costs.

Nevertheless, adopting an edge paradigm grounded in distributed computing has exacerbated the issue of tail latency. Given a limited variety of multimedia services supported by edge servers and the dynamic nature of user requests, employing traditional queuing methods to model tail latency in distributed edge computing is challenging, substantially exacerbating head-of-line (HoL) blocking. In response to this challenge, we have developed a learning-based scheduling method to mitigate the overall tail latency, which adaptively selects appropriate edge servers for execution as incoming distributed tasks vary with unknown size. To optimize the utilization of the edge computing paradigm, we leverage the Laplace transform to theoretically derive an upper bound for the response time of edge servers. Subsequently, we integrate this upper bound into reinforcement learning to facilitate tail learning and enable informed decisions for autonomous distributed scheduling.

Data pipelines are composed of many components, and scaling the entire pipeline without leaving any bottlenecks is challenging. This study aims to assess the performance of scaling mechanisms in handling stochastic workloads efficiently and understanding critical resource utilization in fog environments. We applied workload-based techniques (Request per Second, Queue Length, Message Rate) and resource-based scaling (CPU) on SDP components of two IoT applications: Aeneas (long-running functions) and PuhatuMonitoring (short-running functions).

However, autonomous WVR engagement policy learning is hindered by challenges such as weak exploration capabilities, low learning efficiency, and unrealistic simulated environments. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel imitative reinforcement learning framework, which efficiently leverages expert data while enabling autonomous exploration. The proposed framework not only enhances learning efficiency through expert imitation, but also ensures adaptability to dynamic environments via autonomous exploration with reinforcement learning. Therefore, the proposed framework can learn a successful policy of ‘pursuit-lock-launch’ for UCAVs. To support data-driven learning, we establish an environment based on the Harfang3D sandbox. The extensive experiment results indicate that the proposed framework excels in this multistage task, and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reinforcement learning and imitation learning methods. Thanks to the ability of imitating experts and autonomous exploration, our framework can quickly learn the critical knowledge in complex aerial combat tasks, achieving up to a \\(100\\%\\) success rate and demonstrating excellent robustness.",

Traffic anomaly detection in edge-based autonomous systems has become increasingly crucial for ensuring the security of these systems. Existing works lack consideration of the relationship between traffic attributes and anomaly types. In particular, existing solutions struggle with detecting anomalies that primarily manifest statistical signs in only a few attributes. To address this, we propose a nonnegative factorization-based attribute residual summary and a nonparametric statistic framework for adaptive security monitoring in edge-based autonomous systems. Specifically, the nonnegative factorization, which depends on the multiplicative update rules, is introduced to extract attribute features. Using the tensor linear representation, the attribute residual summary is built, which depicts the statistic discrepancy well even if only a few of traffic attributes are affected, to implement adaptive security monitoring for various attacks in edge-based autonomous systems. Then, a nonparametric statistic framework is developed, which achieves the real-time detection by accumulating and comparing each statistic evidence. Extensive experiments with real-world traffic trace datasets validate the adaptivity, accuracy, real-time performance, and superiority of our method, particularly in dealing with anomalies that exhibit statistical signs in only a few traffic attributes.",

To that end, INSYTE considers the essential characteristics of an AI system across eight key dimensions grouped into four categories: system design ( underspecification and adaptiveness ); functionality ( breadth and depth ); operating environment ( diversity and dynamism ); and independence from human operational control ( intervention and oversight ). Different AI systems (or versions of systems) yield different “patterns” on an eight-axis radar chart that INSYTE uses to provide an immediate visual summary of an AI system's overall capability, and a detailed representation of its individual characteristics.

Classical CBTC systems incorporate bidirectional train-to-wayside (T2W) communications through which trains send their status information to wayside units. T2T-CBTC systems represent a burgeoning direction in the future of CBTC. They adopt train-to-train (T2T) communications for adjacent trains to share status information. T2T communications simplify the architecture of traditional CBTC networks and reduce transmission delays. Wireless communications can introduce cybersecurity threats to inter-train communications. This work proposes two resilient control strategies for T2T-CBTC systems to mitigate the effects of jamming. Both strategies are based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning and aim to control trains’ operations under jamming attacks, allowing them to continue operating safely instead of applying emergency braking. One strategy is based on the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm, and the other is based on the Multi-Agent Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MATD3) algorithm. The strategies are implemented and compared with an existing strategy based on MADDPG. The experimental results indicate that the proposed MADDPG-based strategy shortens the convergence time by 32% to 42%, while the MATD3-based strategy achieves a reduction of 40% to 48%, compared to the baseline.",

    "abstract": "Edge computing (EC) provides an efficient and low-latency computing architecture for mobile multimedia communications. Blockchain-enabled EC can offer enhanced security and data privacy protection in the system, whereas throughput remains a big concern for the blockchain. Sharding is a promising solution to increase the throughput at the cost of complex cross-shard transaction verification. The popular two-phase commit protocol (2PC) can ensure the consistency of cross-shard transaction processing. However, in the existing schemes based on 2PC, the number of intra-shard consensus invocations is proportional to the number of transactions, which imposes a great challenge on the system throughput and adaptivity improvement in sharding blockchains under dynamic transaction processing demands and capacities. In this paper, we propose a transaction processing scheme based on 2PC, such that multiple transactions can be simultaneously processed in a batch during every execution of the consensus. Furthermore, we model the problem of transaction allocation to batches as a communication load balancing problem, aiming to balance the inter-shard communications within each batch under the shard processing capacity constraint. We also propose an effective Batch Transaction Processing algorithm (BTP) for the problem. Theoretical analysis proves that BTP is a 3-approximation algorithm for the communication load balancing problem. In the simulations and experiments on BlockEmulator, BTP respectively improves the system throughput and total transaction processing time by at least 29.41% and 22.64% over the state-of-the-art cross-shard transaction processing schemes, which demonstrates the superior adaptivity performance of BTP.",

    "abstract": "High Performance Computing (HPC) systems are subject to dynamical variations occurring in e.g., jobs execution duration, I/O quantity, network consumption. Adapting to these unpredictable variations requires using autonomic management in an online feedback loop. The introduction of control theory methods allows for the design of well-founded autonomic managers. Choosing the relevant approach is daunting due to the variety of existing controllers. The criteria are of different natures, involving performance and efficiency, but also required expertise in control theory, and reusability or portability between sub-systems. Therefore, there is a need for comparative studies to assist designers choices. We consider the problem of resource harvesting in HPC systems, where scheduling often leaves resources idle. Our approach controls – through a feedback loop – the injection of small jobs in order to maximize the resources’ usage. The control problem is to manage the trade-off between harvesting and performance, in a reusable manner. We study how reusability relates to the adaptivity and robustness properties in control. We illustrate our approach with the classic Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control, its upgrade as adaptive control, and Model-Free Control (MFC). We target CiGri , a system harvesting idle resources in a computing grid. We perform experimental evaluation and compare performance and reusability. Trade-offs are found on different criteria: while adaptive control is largely portable, its design complexity is significant for non-experts; PID control has good nominal performance, yet its portability is limited; MFC requires few competences to be used, but cannot provide strong guarantees.",

However, existing collaborative methods mainly focus on offloading CNN inference tasks from end devices to a single-edge server, which leads to inefficient use of computational resources among nearby edge servers. Moreover, offloading the CNN inference task to a single third-party server may raise privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose a framework named AdapCP that introduces a collaborative and adaptive parallel acceleration strategy that utilizes the end device and multiple edge servers. AdapCP consists of two stages: 1) offloading to nearby servers and 2) parallel processing of the CNN inference. For the offloading phase, we use integer linear programming to find the partition points at the inter-layer level. For the parallel phase, we first investigate intra-layer structural splitting methods tailored for both convolutional and fully connected layers. Then, we employ a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm based on the Dirichlet distribution to decide the partition points. Finally, we set a periodic update index to enhance AdapCP’s adaptability to dynamic environments. Empirical evaluations conducted on the Jetson nano demonstrate that AdapCP significantly reduces the total latency of CNN inference by an average factor of 2.21 \\(\\times\\) compared to existing solutions.",

In addition, the designed attention-aware spatio-temporal graphs provide strong guidance information for the diffusion model, enhancing its ability to accurately predict trajectories.

    "abstract": "As mobile applications grow in complexity, there is an increasing need to perform computationally intensive tasks. However, user devices (UDs), such as tablets and smartphones, have limited capacity to carry out the required computations. Task offloading in mobile edge computing (MEC) is a strategy that meets this demand by distributing tasks between UDs and servers. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a promising solution for this strategy because it can adapt to dynamic changes and minimize online computational complexity. However, various types of continuous and discrete resource constraints on UDs and MEC servers pose challenges to the design of an efficient DRL algorithm. Existing DRL-based task-offloading algorithms focus on the constraints of the UDs, assuming the availability of enough resources on the server. Moreover, existing Multiagent DRL (MADRL)-based task-offloading algorithms are homogeneous agents and consider homogeneous constraints as a penalty in their reward function. We propose a novel Client-Master MADRL (CMMADRL) algorithm for task offloading in MEC that uses client agents at the UDs to decide on their resource requirements and a master agent at the server to make a combinatorial action selection based on the decision of the UDs. CMMADRL is shown to achieve up to 59% improvement in performance over existing benchmark and heuristic algorithms.",

To prioritize the data sharing among multiple companies that do not fully trust each other, we propose a blockchain-based efficient cross-domain access control system named BAAC. It integrates the attribute-based access control model and blockchain for secure and flexible data sharing. Firstly, entity attributes are divided into public attributes and private attributes to provide fine-grained access control. Besides, several smart contracts are designed to efficiently distribute and manage cross-domain attributes, and the data access history is recorded asynchronously on the blockchain. Due to the instability of the real network, a dynamic routing mechanism that distributes data access requests to different blockchain nodes is designed to further improve system efficiency.

Traditional cloud-based data integrity verification methods are no longer suitable. Ocean data should be processed on edge servers located closer to the data collection points and then sent to the appropriate data storage servers. The data processing methods should be lightweight to accommodate the sequential characteristics of data.

These applications heavily rely on Smart Eye-Wears (SEWs) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide users with new ways to perceive their environment. However, SEWs face limitations in computational power, memory, and battery life. Offloading computations to external servers is a prominent example of edge computation. However, this also presents considerable challenges due to delays caused by varying network conditions and server workloads. This paper proposes self-adaptive techniques based on tabular reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize the offloading of Deep Neural Network tasks between the SEW, the user’s smartphone, and cloud servers. The goal is to maintain a high-quality user experience while minimizing energy consumption and 5G connection costs. We evaluated our framework under varying 5G and WiFi bandwidths and cloud latency. The results show that Q-learning, SARSA, and Expected SARSA achieve near-optimal policies, with Q-learning demonstrating superior performance in reducing execution time violations (approximately at 10%) and improving agent stability. Additionally, our approach offers a more favorable trade-off between energy efficiency and execution time violations compared to two baseline methods. Real-system experiments reveal that the proposed solution can double SEW battery life with respect to local computation while maintaining a good quality of service, with only 11% execution time violations.

Data federation, as an emerging data-sharing model, utilizes secure multi-party computation techniques to enable collaboration among data owners without disclosing raw data, offering a new approach to addressing privacy and security concerns in the data exchange process of V2X. This paper proposes a group-by-aggregation query algorithm for data federation, aiming to protect personal privacy data while facilitating effective data sharing and analysis. The algorithm reverses the traditional group-by-aggregation queries process by not transmitting grouping results but rather passing encrypted aggregated attribute values to relevant data owners. By leveraging encryption algorithms with additive homomorphic or order-preserving properties to encrypt the aggregated attribute values, the algorithm ensures the correctness of mathematical operations performed under encryption, such as addition and comparison operations.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a self-configuring architecture for on-demand resource allocation to applications in a shared database cluster. We use a unified approach to load and fault management based on data replication and reactive replica provisioning. While data replication provides scaling and high availability, reactive provisioning dynamically allocates additional replicas to applications in response to peak loads or failure conditions, thus providing per application performance. We design an efficient method for data migration when joining a new replica to a running application that allows for the quick addition of replicas with minimal disruption of transaction processing. Furthermore, by augmenting the adaptation feedback loop with awareness of the delay introduced by the data migration process in our replicated system, we avoid oscillations in resource allocation.We investigate our transparent database provisioning mechanisms in the context of multitier dynamic content Web servers. We dynamically expand/contract the respective allocations within the database tier for two different applications, the TPC-W e-commerce benchmark and the RUBIS online auction benchmark. We demonstrate that our techniques provide quality of service under different load and failure scenarios.",

    "abstract": "This article presents an ant-based approach that enhances the flexibility, robustness and load balancing characteristics of structured P2P systems. Most notably, the approach allows peer indexes and resource keys to be defined on different and independent spaces, so that it overcomes the main limitation of standard structured P2P systems, that is, the need to assign each key to a peer having a specified index. This helps to improve load balancing, especially when the popularity distribution of resource keys is nonuniform, and enables the efficient execution of complex and range queries, which are essential in important types of distributed systems, for example, in Grids and Clouds. Beyond describing the general approach, this article focuses on the specific case of Self-CAN, a self-organizing P2P system that, while relying on the multidimensional structured organization of peers provided by CAN, exploits the operations of ant-based mobile agents to sort the resource keys and distribute them to peers. This system is particularly useful for the management and discovery of the resources that can be conveniently characterized by the values of several independent attributes.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen advances in building large Internet-scale index structures, generally known as structured overlays . Early structured overlays realized distributed hash tables (DHTs) which are ill suited for anything but exact queries. The need to support range queries necessitates systems that can handle uneven load distributions. However such systems suffer from practical problems—including poor latency, disproportionate bandwidth usage at participating peers, or unrealistic assumptions on peers' homogeneity, in terms of available storage or bandwidth resources. In this article we consider a system that is not only able to support uneven load distributions but also to operate in heterogeneous environments, where each peer can autonomously decide how much of its resources to contribute to the system. We provide the theoretical foundations of realizing such a network and present a newly proposed system Oscar based on these principles. Oscar can construct efficient overlays given arbitrary load distributions by employing a novel scalable network sampling technique. The simulations of our system validate the theory and evaluate Oscar's performance under typical challenges, encountered in real-life large-scale networked systems, including participant heterogeneity, faults, and skewed and dynamic load-distributions. Thus the Oscar distributed index fills in an important gap in the family of structured overlays, bringing into life a practical Internet-scale index, which can play a crucial role in enabling data-oriented applications distributed over wide-area networks.",

    "abstract": "Airborne sensor platforms are becoming increasingly significant for both civilian and military operations; yet, at present, their sensors are typically idle for much of their flight time, e.g., while the sensor-equipped platform is in transit to and from the locations of sensing tasks. The sensing needs of many other potential information consumers might thus be served by sharing such sensors, thereby allowing other information consumers to opportunistically task them during their otherwise unscheduled time, as well as enabling other improvements, such as decreasing the number of platforms needed to achieve a goal and increasing the resilience of sensor tasks through duplication. We have implemented a prototype system realizing these goals in Mission-Driven Tasking of Information Producers (MTIP), which leverages an agent-based representation of tasks and sensors to enable fast, effective, and adaptive opportunistic sharing of airborne sensors. Using a simulated large-scale disaster-response scenario populated with publicly available Geographic Information System (GIS) datasets, we demonstrate that correlations in task location are likely to lead to a high degree of potential for sensor-sharing. We then validate that our implementation of MTIP can successfully carry out such sharing, showing that it increases the number of sensor tasks served, reduces the number of platforms required to serve a given set of sensor tasks, and adapts well to radical changes in flight path.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of cloud computing, various types of cloud services are available in the marketplace. However, it remains a significant challenge for cloud users to find suitable services for two major reasons: (1) Providers are unable to offer services in complete accordance with their declared Service Level Agreements, and (2) it is difficult for customers to describe their requirements accurately. To help users select cloud services efficiently, this article presents a Trust enabled Self-Learning Agent Model for service Matching (TSLAM). TSLAM is a multi-agent-based three-layered cloud service market model, in which different categories of agents represent the corresponding cloud entities to perform market behaviors. The unique feature of brokers is that they are not only the service recommenders but also the participants of market competition. We equip brokers with a learning module enabling them to capture implicit service demands and find user preferences. Moreover, a distributed and lightweight trust model is designed to help cloud entities make service decisions. Extensive experiments prove that TSLAM is able to optimize the cloud service matching process and compared to the state-of-the-art studies, TSLAM improves user satisfaction and the transaction success rate by at least 10%.",

In order to achieve this level of specificity, systems must be capable of monitoring the psychological status of the user and responding to these changes in real time and across multiple systems if necessary. This article describes a number of conceptual issues associated with this category of adaptive technology. The biocybernetic loop describes different approaches to monitoring the status of the user from physiological sensors to overt behavior. These data are used to drive real time system adaptation tailored to a specific user in a particular context. The rate at which the technology adapts to the individual user are described over three different phases of usage: awareness (short-term), adjustment (medium-term), and coevolution (long-term). An ontology is then proposed for the development of an adaptive software architecture that embodies this approach and may be extended to encompass several distinct loops working in parallel. The feasibility of the approach is assessed through implemented case studies of their performance and functionality.",

    "abstract": "As the number of devices in a pervasive environment is increased, the number of components available on the network also grows rapidly. In such cases, it is possible to compose various applications through a combination of different sets of components. Considering the multifaceted problem of having varying device capabilities supporting a different set of protocols, and each device hosting a number of components providing the same functionality, it becomes very difficult to choose a particular device hosting a required component which can be the best-fit for the user. This becomes practically impossible when the required components are distributed across various devices in the networked environment. We propose a solution for dynamic user task composition considering user preferences, device capabilities, and heterogeneity of communication protocols. With our proposed approach, a user task can be instantiated in different environments using a different set of devices and components, depending upon their capabilities and user preferences. We propose mechanisms for modeling device capabilities and user preferences and for modeling the user task as a graph. We then propose algorithms for selection of devices based on user preferences and task requirements. Since the underlying network is also modeled as a graph, we describe an algorithm for mapping of services in the user task on to the components distributed across devices in the pervasive environment. We also give an overview of our initial implementation and some results of our evaluations.",

More specifically, we deal with the problem of dynamic, intraquery load balancing in parallel database queries across heterogeneous nodes in a way that takes into account the inherent cost of adaptations and thus avoids both overreacting and deciding when to adapt in a completely heuristic manner. The latter may lead to serious performance degradation in several cases, such as periodic and random imbalances. We follow a control theoretical approach to this problem; more specifically, we propose a multiple-input multiple-output feedback linear quadratic regulation (LQR) controller, which captures the tradeoff between reaching a balanced state and the cost inherent in such adaptations. Our approach, apart from benefitting from and being characterized by a solid theoretical foundation, exhibits better performance than state-of-the-art heuristics in realistic situations, as verified by thorough evaluation.",

The objective is to determine a minimum time schedule to gather the robots as close together as possible around a predefined gathering point avoiding collisions. This problem with minimum time objective has applications in many real-world scenarios including fast autonomous coverage formation. Cord-Landwehr et al. (in Proceedings of the International Conference on Current Trends in Theory and Practice of Computer Science, 2011) gave a local greedy algorithm in a fully synchronous setting and proved that, for the discrete version of the problem where robots’ movements are restricted to the positions on an integral grid, their algorithm solves this problem in O ( nR ) rounds, where R is the distance from the farthest initial robot position to the gathering point. In this article, we improve significantly the round complexity of their algorithm to R + 2 · ( n - 1) rounds. This round complexity is obtained in the following modified model: (1) the viewing range of the robots is increased to three hops and (2) robots can additionally move to the diagonally opposite corner to a grid cell in one step—that is, they can traverse the two corresponding grid edges in one time step. We also prove that there are initial configurations of n robots in this problem where at least R +(n-1)/2 rounds are needed by any local greedy algorithm. Furthermore, we improve the lower bound to R + ( n - 1) rounds for the algorithm of Cord-Landwehr et al. These results altogether provide a tight runtime analysis of their algorithm.",

The algorithm uses a continuously increasing monotonic risk function that allows for the identification of the probability to end up in failure from a given state. Such a risk function is defined in terms of how far such a state is from the state space known by the learning agent. Probabilistic Policy Reuse is used to safely balance the exploitation of actual learned knowledge, the exploration of new actions, and the request of teacher advice in parts of the state space considered dangerous. Specifically, the π-reuse exploration strategy is used. Using experiments in the helicopter hover task and a business management problem, we show that the π-reuse exploration strategy can be used to completely avoid the visit to undesirable situations while maintaining the performance (in terms of the classical long-term accumulated reward) of the final policy achieved.",

    "abstract": "Data management using Device-to-Device (D2D) communications and opportunistic networks (ONs) is one of the main focuses of human-centric pervasive Internet services. In the recently proposed \"Internet of People\" paradigm, accessing relevant data dynamically generated in the environment nearby is one of the key services. Moreover, personal mobile devices become proxies of their human users while exchanging data in the cyber world and, thus, largely use ONs and D2D communications for exchanging data directly. Recently, researchers have successfully demonstrated the viability of embedding human cognitive schemes in data dissemination algorithms for ONs. In this paper, we consider one such scheme based on the recognition heuristic, a human decision-making scheme used to efficiently assess the relevance of data. While initial evidence about its effectiveness is available, the evaluation of its behaviour in large-scale settings is still unsatisfactory. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a novel hybrid modelling methodology, which combines an analytical model of data dissemination within small-scale communities of mobile users, with detailed simulations of interactions between different communities. This methodology allows us to evaluate the algorithm in large-scale city- and country-wide scenarios. Results confirm the effectiveness of cognitive data dissemination schemes, even when content popularity is very heterogenous.",

With an appropriate choice of random distribution, however, it is possible to generate optimal or near-optimal dispersion and mixing in swarms with zero communication. In particular, we discuss three extremely simple algorithms: reactive Levy walk, reactive ball dispersion, and purely reactive dispersion. All three algorithms vastly outperform prior approaches in both constrained and unconstrained environments, providing a range of options for trading off between aggressiveness and evenness in dispersion.",

Techniques for self-adaptation allow these systems to automatically respond to environmental changes, yet they do not handle changes to the adaptive system itself, such as the addition or removal of adaptation tactics. Instead, changes in a self-adaptive system often require a human planner to redo an expensive planning process to allow the system to continue satisfying its quality requirements under different conditions; automated techniques must replan from scratch. We propose to address this problem by reusing prior planning knowledge to adapt to unexpected situations. We present a planner based on genetic programming that reuses existing plans and evaluate this planner on two case-study systems: a cloud-based web server and a team of autonomous aircraft. While reusing material in genetic algorithms has been recently applied successfully in the area of automated program repair, we find that naively reusing existing plans for self- * planning can actually result in a utility loss. Furthermore, we propose a series of techniques to lower the costs of reuse, allowing genetic techniques to leverage existing information to improve utility when replanning for unexpected changes, and we find that coarsely shaped search-spaces present profitable opportunities for reuse.",

Designing multi-agent systems is challenging, and doing this in an automated way is even more so. To address this, we propose a new framework, Evolved Gossip Contracts (EGC). It builds on Gossip Contracts (GC), a decentralised cooperation protocol that is used as the communication mechanism to facilitate self-organisation in a cooperative MAS. GC has several methods that are implemented uniquely, depending on the goal the MAS aims to achieve. The EGC framework uses evolutionary computing to search for the best implementation of these methods. To evaluate EGC, it was used to solve a classical NP-hard optimisation problem, the Bin Packing Problem (BPP). The experimental results show that EGC successfully discovered a decentralised strategy to solve the BPP, which is better than two classical heuristics on test cases similar to those on which it was trained; the improvement is statistically significant. EGC is the first framework that leverages evolutionary computing to semi-automate the discovery of a communication protocol for a MAS that has been shown to be effective at solving an NP-hard problem.",

The adaptation step involves generating an adaptation strategy and applying it to the running system whenever an anomaly arises. In this article, we argue that rather than generating individual adaptation strategies, the goal should be to adapt the control logic of the running system in such a way that the system itself would learn how to steer clear of future anomalies, without triggering self-adaptation too frequently. Although the need for adaptation is never eliminated, especially noting the uncertain and evolving environment of complex systems, reducing the frequency of adaptation interventions is advantageous for various reasons, such as to increase performance and to make a running system more robust. We instantiate and empirically examine the preceding idea for software-defined networking—a key enabling technology for modern data centers and Internet of Things applications. Using genetic programming (GP), we propose a self-adaptation solution that continuously learns and updates the control constructs in the data-forwarding logic of a software-defined network. Our evaluation, performed using open source synthetic and industrial data, indicates that compared to a baseline adaptation technique that attempts to generate individual adaptations, our GP-based approach is more effective in resolving network congestion, and further, it reduces the frequency of adaptation interventions over time. In addition, we show that for networks with the same topology, reusing over larger networks the knowledge that is learned on smaller networks leads to significant improvements in the performance of our GP-based adaptation approach. Finally, we compare our approach against a standard data-forwarding algorithm from the network literature, demonstrating that our approach significantly reduces packet loss.",

    "abstract": "Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) play a critical role in driving self-adaptation in software systems. In Self-Adaptive Systems (SAS), satisfying multiple NFRs simultaneously introduces significant complexity, as these requirements often conflict—improving one NFR can negatively impact others. Addressing such trade-offs becomes even more challenging due to the varying degrees of observability of NFRs, with some being fully observable and others only partially observable. Traditional approaches to SAS decision-making, such as those based on Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), often assume homogeneous observability, which limits their ability to address these challenges effectively. We argue that treating NFRs as having mixed observability—where some are fully observable and others are partially observable—enables more effective decision-making. How can self-adaptive systems model and resolve trade-offs among NFRs with mixed observability to achieve better outcomes? This paper introduces SPECTRA, a multi-objective decision framework based on MDPs. SPECTRA addresses trade-offs among NFRs by leveraging a multi-objective Mixed Observability Markov Decision Process (MOMDP), which models and handles the varying observability of NFRs effectively. The approach is evaluated using scenarios from MirrorNet, a realistic Remote Data Mirroring (RDM) system utilizing Software-Defined Networking (SDN). Results show that SPECTRA achieves higher utility values, faster policy planning, and more effective trade-offs compared to existing approaches.",

    "abstract": "Self-adaptive systems increasingly rely on black-box predictive models, such as Neural Networks, for decision-making and adaptation planning. In this case, adaptation decisions and their potential impact on the surrounding environment are hard to explain. Further, the opaque nature of these models often involves expensive optimization techniques. The computational complexity is a consequence of the inability to directly observe or comprehend the internal mechanisms of the black-box predictive models. This requires iterative methods to explore a possibly large search space and optimize according to many objectives, creating a critical challenge in balancing effectiveness and cost. In this paper, we propose explanation-driven self-adaptation, a novel approach that embeds model-agnostic interpretable machine learning techniques into the feedback loop. In particular, we present XDA-II, an extended version of XDA that integrates multiple explanation sources. This new version combines Partial Dependence Plots and Feature Importance to maintain interpretability while boosting efficiency. Beyond interpretability benefits, explanations become instrumental to guide adaptations through white-box optimization which is more cost-effective than black-box optimization due to the transparency and predictable mathematical properties of the functions involved. Our empirical evaluation using six study subjects shows that XDA-II achieves more efficient convergence towards optimal adaptation solutions compared to four selected baseline methods including existing black-box methods—random search, NSGA-III, and FITEST—and white-box methods—the predecessor XDA.",

    "abstract": "Graph unlearning system offers a promising solution for securely erasing specific data points and their associated influences from graph neural networks (GNNs). However, existing approaches often treat the problem as multiple isolated and disjoint sub-problems by partitioning graph data into isolated subgraphs, which overlooks the native graph structure information between subgraphs. This results in biased representations that hinder the accurate modeling of key connections and relationships within the data, leading to a notable reduction in model utility due to this loss of information. To address these issues, we propose an innovative framework called NIGEraser ( N on- I solated G raph E raser) that decomposes the unlearning task into multiple non-isolated, intersecting sub-problems. Specifically, a novel non-isolated graph partitioning strategy is proposed for NIGEraser that mitigates isolation by replicating key nodes across multiple neighboring subgraphs, along with an attention-based sub-model aggregation technique in that global graph structure information is employed. By this design, a broader natural neighborhood is explored, capturing and effectively utilizing the critical graph structure features lost between subgraphs during partitioning, thereby reducing information loss during task decomposition and aggregation. Additionally, it is demonstrated that graph unlearning methods can overcome the limitations of traditional isolated partitioning strategies, providing an effective theoretical constraint on time consumption. Extensive experiments on four real-world graph-structured datasets show that NIGEraser consistently outperforms existing unlearning methods, offering superior model utility while ensuring efficient and deterministic data removal.",

This bound drops to 2 k when outgoing links are not needed. A second contribution of this article deals with color bootstrapping (from which local topology can be obtained using the aforementioned mechanisms).

On the positive side, we show that ( i ) under the k -central daemon, deterministic self-stabilizing bootstrap of colors up to distance k is possible provided that k -local topology can be instantaneously obtained, and ( ii ) under the distributed daemon, probabilistic self-stabilizing bootstrap is possible for any range.",

    "abstract": "Anomaly-based intrusion detection is about the discrimination of malicious and legitimate behaviors on the basis of the characterization of system normality in terms of particular observable subjects. As the system normality is constructed solely from an observed sample of normally occurring patterns, anomaly detectors always suffer excessive false alerts. Adaptability is therefore a desirable feature that enables an anomaly detector to alleviate, if not eliminate, such annoyance. To achieve that, we either design self-learning anomaly detectors to capture the drifts of system normality or develop postprocessing mechanisms to deal with the outputs. As the former methodology is usually scenario- and application-specific, in this article, we focus on the latter one. In particular, our design starts from three key observations: (1) most of anomaly detectors are threshold based and parametric, that is, configurable by a set of parameters; (2) anomaly detectors differ in operational environment and operational capability in terms of detection coverage and blind spots; (3) an intrusive anomaly may leave traces across multiple system layers, incurring different observable events of interest. Firstly, we present a statistical framework to formally characterize and analyze the basic behaviors of anomaly detectors by examining the properties of their operational environments. The framework then serves as a theoretical basis for developing an adaptive middleware, which is called M-AID, to optimally integrate a number of observation-specific parameterizable anomaly detectors. Specifically, M-AID treats these fine-grained anomaly detectors as a whole and casts their collective behaviors in a framework which is formulated as a Multiagent Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (MPO-MDP). The generic anomaly detection models of M-AID are thus automatically inferred via a reinforcement learning algorithm which dynamically adjusts the behaviors of anomaly detectors in accordance with a reward signal that is defined and quantified by a suit of evaluation metrics. Fundamentally, the distributed and autonomous architecture enables M-AID to be scalable, dependable, and adaptable, and the reward signal allows security administrators to specify cost factors and take into account the operational context for taking rational response. Finally, a host-based prototype of M-AID is developed, along with comprehensive experimental evaluation and comparative studies.",

    "abstract": "Distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) systems can be composed of hundreds of software components running across tens or hundreds of networked processors that are physically separated from one another. A key concern in DRE systems is determining the spatial deployment topology, which is how the software components map to the underlying hardware components. Optimizations, such as placing software components with high-frequency communications on processors that are closer together, can yield a number of important benefits, such as reduced power consumption due to decreased wireless transmission power required to communicate between the processing nodes. Determining a spatial deployment plan across a series of processors that will minimize power consumption is hard since the spatial deployment plan must respect a combination of real-time scheduling, fault-tolerance, resource, and other complex constraints. This article presents a hybrid heuristic/evolutionary algorithm, called ScatterD, for automatically generating spatial deployment plans that minimize power consumption. This work provides the following contributions to the study of spatial deployment optimization for power consumption minimization: (1) it combines heuristic bin-packing with an evolutionary algorithm to produce a hybrid algorithm with excellent deployment derivation capabilities and scalability, (2) it shows how a unique representation of the spatial deployment solution space integrates the heuristic and evolutionary algorithms, and (3) it analyzes the results of experiments performed with data derived from a large-scale avionics system that compares ScatterD with other automated deployment techniques. These results show that ScatterD reduces power consumption by between 6% and 240% more than standard bin-packing, genetic, and particle swarm optimization algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Currently, on one hand, there exist much work about network formation and/or growth models, and on the other hand, cooperative strategy evolutions are extensively investigated in biological, economic, and social systems. Generally, overlay networks are heterogeneous, dynamic, and distributed environments managed by multiple administrative authorities, shared by users with different and competing interests, or even autonomously provided by independent and rational users. Thus, the structure of a whole overlay network and the peers' rational strategies are ever coevolving. However, there are very few approaches that theoretically investigate the coevolution between network structure and individual rational behaviors. The main motivation of our article lies in that: Unlike existing work which empirically illustrates the interaction between rational strategies and network structure (through simulations), based on EGT (Evolutionary Game Theory), we not only infer a condition that could favor the cooperative strategy over defect strategy, but also theoretically characterizes the structural properties of the formed network. Specifically, our contributions are twofold. First, we strictly derive the critical benefit-to-cost ratio ( b / c ) that would facilitate the evolution of cooperation. The critical ratio depends on the network structure (the number of peers in system and the average degree of each peer), and the evolutionary rule (the strategy and linking mutation probabilities). Then, according to the evolutionary rules, we formally derive the structural properties of the formed network in full cooperative state. Especially, the degree distribution is compatible with the power-law, and the exponent is (4-3 v )/(1-3 v ), where v is peer's linking mutation probability. Furthermore, we show that, without being harmful to cooperation evolution, a slight change of the evolutionary rule will evolve the network into a small-world structure (high global efficiency and average clustering coefficient), with the same power-law degree distribution as in the original evolution model.",

In such a scenario, mobile sensors may encounter obstacles or environmental sources of noise, so that movement and sensing capabilities can be significantly altered and become anisotropic. Any reduction of device capabilities cannot be known prior to their actual deployment, nor can it be predicted. We propose a new algorithm for autonomous sensor movements and positioning, called DOMINO (DeplOyment of MobIle Networks with Obstacles). Unlike traditional approaches, DOMINO explicitly addresses these issues by realizing a grid-based deployment throughout the Area of Interest (AoI) and subsequently refining it to cover the target area more precisely in the regions where devices experience reduced sensing. We demonstrate the capability of DOMINO to entirely cover the AoI in a finite time. We also give bounds on the number of sensors necessary to cover an AoI with asperities. Simulations show that DOMINO provides a fast deployment with precise movements and no oscillations, with moderate energy consumption. Furthermore, DOMINO provides better performance than previous solutions in all the operative settings.",

An evolutionary robotic approach is used to design a controller for the setup. Initially, preliminary experiments are performed with a simple predetermined controller and a growing bean plant. The plant behavior in response to the simple controller is captured by image processing, and a model of the plant tip dynamics is developed. The model is used in simulation to evolve a robot controller that steers the plant tip such that it follows a number of randomly generated target points. Finally, we test the simulation-evolved controller in the real setup controlling a natural bean plant. The results demonstrate a successful crossing of the reality gap in the setup.

WSN software must adapt to these dynamics to maintain dependable and efficient operation. However, developers are left without proper support to develop adaptive functionality in WSN software. Our work fills this gap with three key contributions: (i) design concepts help developers organize the necessary adaptive functionality and understand their relations, (ii) dedicated programming constructs simplify the implementations, (iii) custom verification techniques allow developers to check the correctness of their design before deployment. We implement dedicated tool support to tie the three contributions, facilitating their practical application. Our evaluation considers representative WSN applications to analyze code metrics, synthetic simulations, and cycle-accurate emulation of popular WSN platforms. The results indicate that our work is effective in simplifying the development of adaptive WSN software; for example, implementations are provably easier to test and to maintain, the run-time overhead of our dedicated programming constructs is negligible, and our verification techniques return results in a matter of seconds.",

    "abstract": "Android applications are executed on smartphones equipped with a variety of resources that must be properly accessed and controlled, otherwise the correctness of the executions and the stability of the entire environment might be negatively affected. For example, apps must properly acquire, use, and release microphones, cameras, and other multimedia devices, otherwise the behavior of the apps that use the same resources might be compromised. Unfortunately, several apps do not use resources correctly, for instance, due to faults and inaccurate design decisions. By interacting with these apps, users may experience unexpected behaviors, which in turn may cause instability and sporadic failures, especially when resources are accessed. In this article, we present an approach that lets users protect their environment from the apps that use resources improperly by enforcing the correct usage protocol. This is achieved by using software enforcers that can observe executions and change them when necessary. For instance, enforcers can detect that a resource has been acquired but not released and automatically perform the release operation, thus giving the possibility to use that same resource to the other apps. The main idea is that software libraries, in particular, the ones controlling access to resources, can be augmented with enforcers that can be activated and deactivated on demand by users to protect their environment from unwanted app behaviors. We call the software libraries augmented with one or more enforcers proactive libraries , because the activation of the enforcer decorates the library with proactive behaviors that can guarantee the correctness of the execution despite the invocation of the operations implemented by the library. For example, enforcers can detect that a resource has not been released on time and proactively release it. Our experimental results with 27 possible misuses of resources in real Android apps reveal that proactive libraries are able to effectively correct library misuses with negligible runtime overheads.",

    "abstract": "Computational reputation-based trust models using statistical learning have been intensively studied for distributed systems where peers behave maliciously. However practical applications of such models in environments with both malicious and rational behaviors are still very little understood. In this article, we study the relation between their accuracy measures and their ability to enforce cooperation among participants and discourage selfish behaviors. We provide theoretical results that show the conditions under which cooperation emerges when using computational trust models with a given accuracy, and how cooperation can still be sustained while reducing the cost and accuracy of those models. Specifically, we propose a peer selection protocol that uses a computational trust model as a dishonesty detector to filter out unfair ratings. We prove that such a model with reasonable misclassification error bound in identifying malicious ratings can effectively build trust and cooperation in the system, considering rationality of participants. These results reveal two interesting observations. First, the key to the success of a reputation system in a rational environment is not a sophisticated trust-learning mechanism, but an effective identity-management scheme to prevent whitewashing behaviors. Second, given an appropriate identity-management mechanism, a reputation-based trust model with a moderate accuracy bound can be used to effectively enforce cooperation in systems with both rational and malicious participants. As a result, in heterogeneous environments where peers use different algorithms to detect misbehavior of potential partners, cooperation may still emerge. We verify and extend these theoretical results to a variety of settings involving honest, malicious, and strategic players through extensive simulation. These results will enable a much more targeted, cost-effective and realistic design for decentralized trust management systems, such as needed for peer-to-peer, electronic commerce, or community systems.",

    "abstract": "Performance improvement and energy efficiency are two important goals in provisioning Internet services in datacenter servers. In this article, we propose and develop a self-tuning request batching mechanism to simultaneously achieve the two correlated goals. The batching mechanism increases the cache hit rate at the front-tier Web server, which provides the opportunity to improve an application’s performance and the energy efficiency of the server system. The core of the batching mechanism is a novel and practical two-layer control system that adaptively adjusts the batching interval and frequency states of CPUs according to the service level agreement and the workload characteristics. The batching control adopts a self-tuning fuzzy model predictive control approach for application performance improvement. The power control dynamically adjusts the frequency of Central Processing Units (CPUs) with Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) in response to workload fluctuations for energy efficiency. A coordinator between the two control loops achieves the desired performance and energy efficiency. We further extend the self-tuning batching with DVFS approach from a single-server system to a multiserver system. It relies on a MIMO expert fuzzy control to adjust the CPU frequencies of multiple servers and coordinate the frequency states of CPUs at different tiers. We implement the mechanism in a test bed. Experimental results demonstrate that the new approach significantly improves the application performance in terms of the system throughput and average response time. At the same time, the results also illustrate the mechanism can reduce the energy consumption of a single-server system by 13% and a multiserver system by 11%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "In this work, the problem of topology control for self-adaptation in stationary Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is revisited, specifically for the case of networks with a subset of nodes having temporary connection impairment between them. This study focuses on misbehaviors arising due to the presence of\\enskip “dumb” nodes [Misra et al. 2014; Roy et al. 2014a, 2014b, 2014c; Kar and Misra 2015], which can sense its surroundings but cannot communicate with its neighbors due to shrinkage in its communication range by the environmental effects attributed to change in temperature, rainfall, and fog. However, a dumb node is expected to behave normally on the onset of favorable environmental conditions. Therefore, the presence of such dumb nodes in the network gives rise to impaired connectivity between a subset of nodes and, consequently, results in change in topology. Such phenomena are dynamic in nature and are thus distinct from the phenomena attributed to traditional isolation problems considered in stationary WSNs. Activation of all the sensor nodes simultaneously is not necessarily energy efficient and cost-effective. In order to maintain self-adaptivity of the network, two algorithms, named Connectivity Re-establishment in the presence of Dumb nodes ( CoRD ) and Connectivity Re-establishment in the presence of Dumb nodes Without Applying Constraints ( CoRDWAC ), are designed. The performance of these algorithms is evaluated through simulation-based experiments. Further, it is also observed that the performance of CoRD is better than the existing topology control protocols—LETC and A1—with respect to the number of nodes activated, overhead, and energy consumption.",

Results : Results have shown that self-awareness has been used to enable self-adaptation in systems that exhibit uncertain and dynamic behaviour. Though there have been recent attempts to define and engineer self-awareness in software engineering, there is no consensus on the definition of self-awareness. Also, the distinction between self-aware and self-adaptive systems has not been systematically treated. Conclusions : Our survey reveals that self-awareness for software systems is still a formative field and that there is growing attention to incorporate self-awareness for better reasoning about the adaptation decision in autonomic systems. Many pending issues and open problems outline possible research directions.",

Prevalent solution techniques are centralized and model based—limitations that we address by distributed reinforcement learning (RL). We particularly favor alternate learning, where agents alternately learn best responses to each other, which appears to outperform concurrent RL. However, alternate learning requires an initial policy. We propose two principled approaches to generating informed initial policies: a naive approach that lays the foundation for a more sophisticated approach. We empirically demonstrate that the refined approach produces near-optimal solutions in many challenging benchmark settings, staking a claim to being an efficient (and realistic) approximate solver in its own right. Furthermore, alternate best response learning seeded with such policies quickly learns high-quality policies as well.",

    "abstract": "A data-centric joint adaptive sampling and sleep scheduling solution, SILENCE, for autonomic sensor-based systems that monitor and reconstruct physical or environmental phenomena is proposed. Adaptive sampling and sleep scheduling can help realize the much needed resource efficiency by minimizing the communication and processing overhead in densely deployed autonomic sensor-based systems. The proposed solution exploits the spatiotemporal correlation in sensed data and eliminates redundancy in transmitted data through selective representation without compromising on accuracy of reconstruction of the monitored phenomenon at a remote monitor node. Differently from existing adaptive sampling solutions, SILENCE employs temporal causality analysis to not only track the variation in the underlying phenomenon but also its cause and direction of propagation in the field. The causality analysis and the same correlations are then leveraged for adaptive sleep scheduling aimed at saving energy in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). SILENCE outperforms traditional adaptive sampling solutions as well as the recently proposed compressive sampling techniques. Real experiments were performed on a WSN testbed monitoring temperature and humidity distribution in a rack of servers, and the simulations were performed on TOSSIM, the TinyOS simulator.",

We describe three distributed gesture-recognition algorithms that are designed to function on sensor arrays with minimal computational power, limited memory, limited bandwidth, and possibly unreliable communication. These constraints cause storage of gesture templates within the system and distributed consensus algorithms for recognizing gestures to be difficult. Building up on a chain vector encoding algorithm commonly used for gesture recognition on a central computer, we approach this problem by dividing the gesture dataset between nodes such that each node has access to the complete dataset via its neighbors. Nodes share gesture information among each other, then each node tries to identify the gesture. In order to distribute the computational load among all nodes, we also investigate an alternative algorithm, in which each node that detects a motion will apply a recognition algorithm to part of the input gesture, then share its data with all other motion nodes. Next, we show that a hybrid algorithm that distributes both computation and template storage can address trade-offs between memory and computational efficiency.",

Moreover, distributed systems should be able to adapt their structural relations to changes in environmental conditions.

During the service discovery process, agents integrate a mechanism that facilitates the self-organization of their structural relations to adapt the structure of the system to the service demand. This mechanism facilitates the task of decentralized service discovery and improves its performance. Each agent has local knowledge about its direct neighbors and the queries received during discovery processes. With this information, an agent is able to analyze its structural relations and decide when it is more appropriate to modify its direct neighbors and select the most suitable acquaintances to replace them. The experimental evaluation shows how this self-organization mechanism improves the overall performance of the service discovery process in the system when the service demand changes.",

Convergence of self-organizing control, however, is slow in some practical applications compared to control with conventional deterministic systems using global information. It is therefore important to facilitate convergence of self-organizing controls. In controlled self-organization, which introduces an external controller into self-organizing systems, the network is controlled to guide systems to a desired state. Although existing controlled self-organization schemes could achieve this feature, convergence speed for reaching an optimal or semioptimal solution is still a challenging task. We perform potential-based self-organizing routing and propose an optimal feedback method using a reduced-order model for faster convergence at low cost. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism improves the convergence speed of potential-field construction (i.e., route construction) by at most 22.6 times with low computational and communication cost.",

Most of these algorithms assume that the number of clusters, k , is known and fixed a priori by the user. Aimed at relaxing this assumption, which is often unrealistic in practical applications, we propose a support system that allows not only estimating the number of clusters automatically from data but also monitoring the process of the data-stream clustering. We illustrate the potential of the proposed system by means of a prototype that implements eight algorithms for clustering data streams, namely, Stream LSearch-OMR k , Stream LSearch-B k M, Stream LSearch-IOMR k , Stream LSearch-IB k M, CluStream-OMR k , CluStream-B k M, StreamKM++-OMR k , and StreamKM++−B k M. These algorithms are combinations of three state-of-the-art algorithms for clustering data streams with fixed k , namely, Stream LSearch, CluStream, and StreamKM++, with two algorithms for estimating the number of clusters, which are Ordered Multiple Runs of k -Means (OMR k ) and Bisecting k -Means (B k M). We experimentally compare the performance of these algorithms using both synthetic and real-world data streams. Analyses of statistical significance suggest that the algorithms that are based on OMR k yield the best data partitions, while the algorithms that are based on B k M are more computationally efficient. Additionally, StreamKM++−OMR k and Stream LSearch-IB k M provide the best tradeoff relationship between accuracy and efficiency.",

However, in practice, the system’s state may not be fully observable, and the adaptation actions may produce unexpected effects due to uncertain factors. This article presents a novel probabilistic approach to quantify the uncertainty associated with the effects of adaptation actions on the state of a SAS. Supported by Bayesian inference and POMDPs (Partially-Observable Markov Decision Processes), these effects are translated into the satisfaction levels of the non-functional requirements (NFRs) to, therefore, drive the decision-making. The approach has been applied to two substantial case studies from the networking and Internet of Things (IoT) domains, using two different POMDP solvers.

    "abstract": "The Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) serves as a pivotal element within urban networks, offering decision support to users and connected automated vehicles (CAVs) through comprehensive information gathering, sensing, device control, and data processing. Presently, ITS predominantly relies on sensors embedded in fixed infrastructure, notably Roadside Units (RSUs). However, RSUs are confined by coverage limitations and may encounter challenges in prompt emergency responses. On-demand resources, such as drones, present a viable option to supplement these deficiencies effectively. This paper introduces an approach where Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) technologies are integrated to formulate a high-availability drone swarm control and communication infrastructure framework, comprising the cloud layer, edge layer, and device layer. Drones confront limitations in flight duration attributed to battery limitations, posing a challenge in sustaining continuous monitoring of road conditions over extended periods. Effective drone scheduling stands as a promising solution to overcome these constraints. To tackle this issue, we initially utilized Graph WaveNet, a specialized graph neural network structure tailored for spatial-temporal graph modeling, for training a congestion prediction model using real-world dataset inputs. Building upon this, we further propose an algorithm for drone scheduling based on congestion prediction. Our simulation experiments using real-world data demonstrate that, compared to the baseline method, the proposed scheduling algorithm not only yielded superior scheduling gains but also mitigated drone idle rates.",

    "abstract": "When humans and autonomous systems operate together as what we refer to as a hybrid team, we of course wish to ensure the team operates successfully and effectively. We refer to team members as agents. In our proposed framework, we address the case of hybrid teams in which, at any time, only one team member (the control agent) is authorized to act as control for the team. To determine the best selection of a control agent, we propose the addition of an AI manager (via Reinforcement Learning) which learns as an outside observer of the team. The manager learns a model of behavior linking observations of agent performance and the environment/world the team is operating in, and from these observations makes the most desirable selection of a control agent. From our review of current state of the art, we present a novel manager model for oversight of hybrid teams by our support for diverse agents and decision-maker operations across multiple time steps and decisions. In our model, we restrict the manager’s task by introducing a set of constraints. The manager constraints indicate acceptable team operation, so a violation occurs if the team enters a condition which is unacceptable and requires manager intervention. To ensure minimal added complexity or potential inefficiency for the team, the manager should attempt to minimize the number of times the team reaches a constraint violation and requires subsequent manager intervention. Therefore, our manager is optimizing its selection of authorized agents to boost overall team performance while minimizing the frequency of manager intervention. We demonstrate our manager’s performance in a simulated driving scenario representing the case of a hybrid team of agents composed of a human driver and autonomous driving system. We perform experiments for our driving scenario with interfering vehicles, indicating the need for collision avoidance and proper speed control. Our results indicate a positive impact on our manager, with some cases resulting in increased team performance up to \\(\\approx 187\\%\\) that of the best solo agent performance.",

The combination of Web3.0 and edge content caching holds promise in providing low-latency data access for CAVs’ real-time applications. Web3.0 enables the reliable pre-migration of frequently requested content from content providers to edge nodes. However, identifying optimal edge node peers for joint content caching and replacement remains challenging due to the dynamic nature of traffic flow in IoV. Addressing these challenges, this article introduces GAMA-Cache, an innovative edge content caching methodology leveraging Graph Attention Networks (GAT) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). GAMA-Cache conceptualizes the cooperative edge content caching issue as a constrained Markov decision process. It employs a MARL technique predicated on cooperation effectiveness to discern optimal caching decisions, with GAT augmenting information extracted from adjacent nodes. A distinct collaborator selection mechanism is also developed to streamline communication between agents, filtering out those with minimal correlations in the vector input to the policy network. Experimental results demonstrate that, in terms of service latency and delivery failure, the GAMA-Cache outperforms other state-of-the-art MARL solutions for edge content caching in IoV.",

Focusing on traffic-induced dynamics, we examine the open, unexplored question of how serious the BLS issue is and how to effectively address it when the routing metric ETX is used. For a wide range of traffic patterns and network topologies and using both node-oriented and network-wide analysis and experimentation, we discover that the optimal routing structure remains quite stable even though the properties of individual links and routes vary significantly as traffic pattern changes. In cases where the optimal routing structure does change, data-driven link estimation and routing is either guaranteed to converge to the optimal structure or empirically shown to converge to a close-to-optimal structure. These findings provide the foundation for addressing the BLS issue in the presence of traffic-induced dynamics and suggest approaches other than existing ones. These findings also demonstrate that it is possible to maintain an optimal, stable routing structure despite the fact that the properties of individual links and paths vary in response to network dynamics.",

Based on the observation that various biological systems have already satisfied these requirements, this article proposes and evaluates a biologically-inspired framework that makes network applications to be autonomous, scalable, adaptive, and survivable. With the proposed framework, called iNet, each network application is designed as a decentralized group of software agents, analogous to a bee colony (application) consisting of multiple bees (agents). Each agent provides a particular functionality of a network application, and implements biological behaviors such as reproduction, migration, energy exchange, and death. iNet is designed after the mechanisms behind how the immune system detects antigens (e.g., viruses) and produces specific antibodies to eliminate them. It models a set of environment conditions (e.g., network traffic and resource availability) as an antigen and an agent behavior (e.g., migration) as an antibody. iNet allows each agent to autonomously sense its surrounding environment conditions (an antigen) to evaluate whether it adapts well to the sensed environment, and if it does not, adaptively perform a behavior (an antibody) suitable for the environment conditions. In iNet, a configuration of antibodies is encoded as a set of genes, and antibodies evolve via genetic operations such as crossover and mutation. Empirical measurement results show that iNet is lightweight enough. Simulation results show that agents adapt to dynamic and heterogeneous network environments by evolving their antibodies across generations. The results also show that iNet allows agents to scale to workload volume and network size and to survive partial link failures in the network.",

This helps to explain the onset and persistence of many undesired phenomena, for example, traffic jams. It also reflects the apparent helplessness of drivers in traffic, who feel like passive particles that are pushed around by exterior forces; one of the crucial aspects is the inability to communicate and coordinate with other traffic participants. We present distributed methods for solving these fundamental problems, employing modern wireless, ad-hoc, multi-hop networks. The underlying idea is to use these capabilities as the basis for self-organizing methods for coordinating data collection and processing, recognizing traffic phenomena, and changing their structure by coordinated behavior. The overall objective is a multi-level approach that reaches from protocols for local wireless communication, data dissemination, pattern recognition, over hierarchical structuring and coordinated behavior, all the way to large-scale traffic regulation. In this article, we describe three types of results: (i) self-organizing and distributed methods for maintaining and collecting data (using our concept of Hovering Data Clouds ); (ii) adaptive data dissemination for traffic information systems; (iii) methods for self-recognition of traffic jams.

We study in this article the problem of finding peers matching a given availability pattern in a peer-to-peer (P2P) system. Motivated by practical examples, we specify two formal problems of availability matching that arise in real applications: disconnection matching , where peers look for partners expected to disconnect at the same time, and presence matching , where peers look for partners expected to be online simultaneously in the future. As a scalable and inexpensive solution, we propose to use epidemic protocols for topology management; we provide corresponding metrics for both matching problems. We evaluated this solution by simulating two P2P applications, task scheduling and file storage , over a new trace of the eDonkey network, the largest one with availability information. We first proved the existence of regularity patterns in the sessions of 14M peers over 27 days. We also showed that, using only 7 days of history, a simple predictor could select predictable peers and successfully predicted their online periods for the next week. Finally, simulations showed that our simple solution provided good partners fast enough to match the needs of both applications, and that consequently, these applications performed as efficiently at a much lower cost. This solution is purely distributed as it does not rely on any central server or oracle to operate. We believe that this work will be useful for many P2P applications for which it has been shown that choosing good partners, based on their availability, drastically improves their performance and stability.",

While anycasting offers better service flexibility in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), it also incurs new problems. In MANETs, every node can move arbitrarily, and the routes from mobile nodes to their service providers would vary. Therefore, anycast service discovery in MANETs usually relies on network-layer message broadcasting, which leads to large traffic overhead for the scarce bandwidth of MANETs. In this work, we present a traffic-control scheme for anycast service discovery in MANETs. Our scheme can reduce the volume of query messages and the reply messages. In addition to basic anycasting, our scheme also supports k-anycast service that requests for k anycast service providers in each service instance. With k-anycast service, the fault tolerance and service flexibility of our scheme can be improved. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme is efficient and feasible for MANETs.",

We explore the fundamental properties of our framework using a combination of analytical and numerical methods.

    "abstract": "Discrete event simulations model the behavior of complex, real-world systems. Simulating a wide range of events and conditions provides a more nuanced model, but also increases its computational footprint. To manage these processing requirements in a scalable manner, discrete event simulations can be distributed across multiple computing resources. Orchestrating the simulations in a distributed setting involves coping with resource uncertainty. We consider three key aspects of resource uncertainty: resource failures, heterogeneity, and slowdowns. Each of these aspects is managed autonomously, which involves making accurate predictions of future execution times and latencies while also accounting for differences in hardware capabilities and dynamic resource consumption profiles. Further complicating matters, individual tasks within the simulation are stateful and stochastic, requiring inter-task communication and synchronization to produce accurate outcomes. We deal with these challenges through intelligent state collection and migration, active resource monitoring, and empirical evaluation of resource capabilities under changing conditions. To underscore the viability of our solution, we provide benchmarks using a production discrete event simulation that can simultaneously sustain failures, manage resource heterogeneity, and handle slowdowns while being orchestrated by our framework.",

    "abstract": "Multi-tenancy is a key pillar of cloud services. It allows different users to share computing and virtual resources transparently, meanwhile guaranteeing substantial cost savings. Due to the tradeoff between scalability and customization, one of the major drawbacks of multi-tenancy is limited configurability. Since users may often have conflicting configuration preferences, offering the best user experience is an open challenge for service providers. In addition, the users, their preferences, and the operational environment may change during the service operation, thus jeopardizing the satisfaction of user preferences. In this article, we present an approach to support user-centric adaptation of multi-tenant services. We describe how to engineer the activities of the Monitoring, Analysis, Planning, Execution (MAPE) loop to support user-centric adaptation, and we focus on adaptation analysis. Our analysis computes a service configuration that optimizes user satisfaction, complies with infrastructural constraints, and minimizes reconfiguration obtrusiveness when user- or service-related changes take place. To support our analysis, we model multi-tenant services and user preferences by using feature and preference models, respectively. We illustrate our approach by utilizing different cases of virtual desktops. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the analysis in improving user preferences satisfaction in negligible time.",

    "abstract": "Underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) have been developed for a set of underwater applications, including the resource exploration, pollution monitoring, tactical surveillance, and so on. However, the complexity and diversity of the underwater environment differentiate it significantly from the terrestrial environment. In particular, the coverage requirements (i.e., coverage degrees and coverage probabilities) at different regions probably differ underwater. Nevertheless, little effort has been made so far on the topology control of UWSNs given the diverse coverage requirements. To this end, this article proposes two algorithms for the diverse coverage problem in UWSNs: (1) Traversal Algorithm for Diverse Coverage (TADC), which adjusts the sensing radii of nodes successively, that is, at each round only one node alters its sensing radius, and (2) Radius Increment Algorithm for Diverse Coverage (RIADC), which sets the sensing radii of nodes incrementally, that is, at each round multiple nodes may increase their sensing radii simultaneously. The performances of TADC and RIADC are analyzed through mathematical analysis and simulations. The results reveal that both TADC and RIADC can achieve the diverse coverage while minimizing the energy consumption. Moreover, TADC and RIADC perform nicely in obtaining optimal sensing radii and reducing message complexity, respectively. Such merits further indicate that TADC and RIADC are suitable for small-scale and large-scale UWSNs, respectively.",

We propose a new take on the issue: Rather than classically developing new algorithms, we apply a macro-level paradigm, called aggregate computing , specifically designed to directly program the global behaviour of a whole ensemble of devices at once. To understand the potential of the application of aggregate computing to OMOkC, we extend the Alchemist simulator (supporting aggregate computing natively) with a novel toolchain component supporting the simulation of mobile robots. This way, we build a software engineering toolchain comprising language and simulation tooling for addressing OMOkC. Finally, we exercise our approach and related toolchain by introducing new algorithms for OMOkC; we show that they can be expressed concisely, reuse existing software components and perform better than the current state-of-the-art in terms of coverage over time and number of objects covered overall.",

Clustering the modules in modular robots has many benefits, including scalability, energy-efficiency, reducing communication delay, and improving the self-reconfiguration process that focuses on finding a sequence of reconfiguration actions to convert robots from an initial shape to a goal one. The main idea of clustering is to divide the modules in an initial shape into a number of groups based on the final goal shape to enhance the self-reconfiguration process by allowing clusters to reconfigure in parallel. In this work, we prove that the size-constrained clustering problem is NP-complete, and we propose a new tree-based size-constrained clustering algorithm called “SC-Clust.” To show the efficiency of our approach, we implement and demonstrate our algorithm in simulation on networks of up to 30000 modules and on the Blinky Blocks hardware with up to 144 modules.",

We introduce a closed-loop method that is used to learn the estimated value and the corresponding policy of each candidate action persistence. Our experiment shows that GLDAP achieves an average of 2.5%~90.7% performance improvement and 3~20 times higher sampling efficiency over several baselines across various single-agent and multi-agent domains.

    "abstract": "Recently, machine learning (ML) has become a popular approach to support self-adaptation. ML has been used to deal with several problems in self-adaptation, such as maintaining an up-to-date runtime model under uncertainty and scalable decision-making. Yet, exploiting ML comes with inherent challenges. In this article, we focus on a particularly important challenge for learning-based self-adaptive systems: drift in adaptation spaces. With adaptation space, we refer to the set of adaptation options a self-adaptive system can select from to adapt at a given time based on the estimated quality properties of the adaptation options. A drift of adaptation spaces originates from uncertainties, affecting the quality properties of the adaptation options. Such drift may imply that the quality of the system may deteriorate, eventually, no adaptation option may satisfy the initial set of adaptation goals, or adaptation options may emerge that allow enhancing the adaptation goals. In ML, such a shift corresponds to a novel class appearance, a type of concept drift in target data that common ML techniques have problems dealing with. To tackle this problem, we present a novel approach to self-adaptation that enhances learning-based self-adaptive systems with a lifelong ML layer. We refer to this approach as lifelong self-adaptation . The lifelong ML layer tracks the system and its environment, associates this knowledge with the current learning tasks, identifies new tasks based on differences, and updates the learning models of the self-adaptive system accordingly. A human stakeholder may be involved to support the learning process and adjust the learning and goal models. We present a general architecture for lifelong self-adaptation and apply it to the case of drift of adaptation spaces that affects the decision-making in self-adaptation. We validate the approach for a series of scenarios with a drift of adaptation spaces using the DeltaIoT exemplar.",

Communication networks form a significant integrant of ubiquitous and pervasive Grids and must be utilized effectively by the Grids. The notion of Grid network service may greatly facilitate integrating networking systems into the Grid architecture, and network service description and discovery play a crucial role in the network-Grid integration. Current service description and discovery technologies must be enhanced to meet the special requirements of network service description and discovery for high-performance ubiquitous and pervasive Grids. Network service description needs a model for service provisioning capability and network service discovery must be able to select those networks that meet certain performance requirements. The wide variety of networking systems in ubiquitous and pervasive Grids require general and flexible network service description and discovery approaches that are applicable to heterogeneous networks. The research presented in this article aims at developing network service description and discovery technologies for high-performance ubiquitous and pervasive Grid computing. The main contributions of this article include a general model for describing service capabilities of various networking systems, a service discovery technology for selecting network services that meet the performance requirements specified by Grid applications, and a resource allocation scheme for Grid network services to provide networking performance guarantees. The developed model and technologies are general and flexible; thus are applicable to the wide variety of heterogeneous networks in ubiquitous and pervasive Grid computing environments.",

    "abstract": "Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs) involving camera and Scalar Sensor (SS) nodes provide precise information of events occurring in the monitored region by transmitting video packets. In WMSNs, it is necessary to provide coverage of events occurring in the monitored region for longer durations of time. The Camera Sensor (CS) nodes provide the coverage of an event and transmit the video data to the Base Station (BS), when these nodes are actuated by the associated SS nodes on occurring of an event. Therefore, in the existing pieces of work, distributed actuation focuses on the coverage of an event and prolongation of the lifetime of the CS nodes. However, for distributed actuation of the CS nodes, the SS nodes play a vital role. When the data sent by the associated SS nodes in an event area exceed the preconfigured threshold, the CS nodes start sensing the event and send the video data to the BS. Therefore, in addition to the lifetime of the CS nodes, the lifetime of the SS nodes and their data reporting latencies are important aspects for distributed actuation of the CS nodes, while sending both the video and scalar data to the BS. In this work, we propose a topology management-based distributed camera actuation scheme, named TADA, to prolong the lifetime of SS nodes, and decrease the data reporting latency in event area only. The increased lifetime of the SS nodes, in turn, increases the event coverage and packet delivery ratio. To increase the lifetime of the SS nodes in an event area, the SS nodes with the most residual energies are selected as the packet aggregators. In addition, the transmission range of these nodes is decreased, and in-network packet aggregation is performed, while reporting the happening of an event to the associated CS nodes. The aggregator selection mechanism helps in balancing energy consumption of the SS nodes. Similarly, the decrease in transmission range and aggregation mechanism help in decreasing energy consumption of these nodes. The transmission range of the SS nodes is decreased using social network analysis and Coalition Formation Game (CFG). CFG also helps in decreasing the data reporting latency of an event by the SS nodes to their associated CS nodes. Performance evaluation results show that the proposed scheme, TADA, which is based on the distributed topology management protocol named T-Must, achieves high performance in terms of the lifetime of the SS nodes, data reporting latency, coverage ratio of the event, event reporting credibility index, and packet delivery ratio in an environment affected by shadow fading.",

    "abstract": "Self-adaptation has been proposed as a mechanism to counter complexity in control problems of technical systems. A major driver behind self-adaptation is the idea to transfer traditional design-time decisions to runtime and into the responsibility of systems themselves. To deal with unforeseen events and conditions, systems need creativity—typically realized by means of machine learning capabilities. Such learning mechanisms are based on different sources of knowledge. Feedback from the environment used for reinforcement purposes is probably the most prominent one within the self-adapting and self-organizing (SASO) systems community. However, the impact of other (sub-)systems on the success of the individual system’s learning performance has mostly been neglected in this context. In this article, we propose a novel methodology to identify effects of actions performed by other systems in a shared environment on the utility achievement of an autonomous system. Consider smart cameras (SC) as illustrating example: For goals such as 3D reconstruction of objects, the most promising configuration of one SC in terms of pan/tilt/zoom parameters depends largely on the configuration of other SCs in the vicinity. Since such mutual influences cannot be pre-defined for dynamic systems, they have to be learned at runtime. Furthermore, they have to be taken into consideration when self-improving their own configuration decisions based on a feedback loop concept, e.g., known from the SASO domain or the Autonomic and Organic Computing initiatives. We define a methodology to detect such influences at runtime, present an approach to consider this information in a reinforcement learning technique, and analyze the behavior in artificial as well as real-world SASO system settings.",

Currently, resource demand estimators are usually executed once for system analysis. However, the monitored system, as well as the resource demand itself, are subject to constant change in runtime environments. These changes additionally impact the applicability, the required parametrization as well as the resulting accuracy of individual estimation approaches. Over time, this leads to invalid or outdated estimates, which in turn negatively influence the decision-making of adaptive systems. In this article, we present SARDE , a framework for self-adaptive resource demand estimation in continuous environments. SARDE dynamically and continuously tunes, selects, and executes an ensemble of resource demand estimation approaches to adapt to changes in the environment. This creates an autonomous and unsupervised ensemble estimation technique, providing reliable resource demand estimations in dynamic environments. We evaluate SARDE using two realistic datasets. One set of different micro-benchmarks reflecting different possible system states and one dataset consisting of a continuously running application in a changing environment. Our results show that by continuously applying online optimization, selection and estimation, SARDE is able to efficiently adapt to the online trace and reduce the model error using the resulting ensemble technique.",

Although the benefits of incorporating self-expression are well known, currently there is no principled means of enabling this during system design. We propose a conceptual framework for principled design of systems that exhibit self-expression, based on inspiration from the natural immune system. The framework is described as a set of design principles and customizable algorithms and then is instantiated in three case studies, including two from robotics and one from artificial chemistry.

A straightforward scheme for assigning symmetric keys to the different processes in such a network is to assign each process O ( d ) keys, where d is the maximum number of neighbors of any process in the network. In this article, we present a more efficient scheme for assigning symmetric keys to the different processes in a communication network. This scheme, which is referred to as logarithmic keying, assigns O (log d ) symmetric keys to each process in the network. We show that logarithmic keying can be used in rich classes of communication networks that include star networks, acyclic networks, limited-cycle networks, planar networks, and dense bipartite networks. In addition, we present a construction that utilizes efficient keying schemes for general bipartite networks to construct efficient keying schemes for general networks.",

In earlier work, it was shown that QoS adaptation should be dependable, if correctness of protocol properties is to be maintained. More recently, some ideas concerning specific strategies and methodologies for improving QoS adaptation have been proposed. In this article we describe Adaptare , a complete framework for dependable QoS adaptation. We assume that during its lifetime, a system alternates periods where its temporal behavior is well characterized, with transition periods during which a variation of the environment conditions occurs. Our method is based on the following: if the environment is generically characterized in analytical terms, and we can detect the alternation of these stable and transient phases, we can improve the effectiveness and dependability of QoS adaptation. To prove our point we provide detailed evaluation results of the proposed solutions. Our evaluation is based on synthetic data flows generated from probabilistic distributions, as well as on real data traces collected in various Internet-based environments. We compare our solution with other approaches and we show that Adaptare, albeit more complex, is very effective, allowing protocols to adapt to the available resources in a dependable way.",

    "abstract": "Resource pools are collections of computational resources (e.g., servers) which can be used by different applications in a shared way. A crucial aspect in these pools is to allocate resources so as to ensure their proper usage, taking into account workload and specific requirements of each application. An interesting approach, in this context, is to allocate the resources in the best possible way, aiming at optimal resource usage. Workload, however, varies over time, and in turn, resource demands will vary too. To ensure that optimal resource usage is always in place, resource shares should be defined dynamically and over time. It has been claimed that utility functions are the main tool for enabling such self-optimizing behavior. Whereas many solutions with this characteristic have been proposed to date, none of them presents true decentralization within the context of shared pools. In this article, we then propose a decentralized model for optimal resource usage in shared resource pools, providing practical and theoretical evidence of its feasibility.",

    "abstract": "This article presents a novel intelligent embedded agent approach for reducing the number of associations and interconnections between various agents operating within ad hoc multiagent societies of an Ambient Intelligent Environment (AIE) in order to reduce the processing latency and overheads. The main goal of the proposed fuzzy-based intelligent embedded agents (F-IAS) includes learning the overall network configuration and adapting to the system functionality to personalize themselves to the user needs based on monitoring the user in a lifelong nonintrusive mode. In addition, the F-IAS agents aim to reduce the agent interconnections to the most relevant set of agents in order to reduce the processing overheads and thus implicitly improving the system overall efficiency. We employ embedded ambassador agents, namely embassadors, which are designated F-IAS agents utilized with additional novel characteristics to not only act as a gateway filtering the number of messages multicast across societies but also discover, recommend, and establish associations between agents residing in separate societies. In order to validate the efficiency of the proposed methods for multiagent and society-based intelligent association discovery and learning of F-IAS agents/embassadors we will present two sets of unique experiments. The first experiment describes the obtained results carried out within the intelligent Dormitory (iDorm) which is a real-world testbed for AIE research. Here we specifically demonstrate the utilization of the F-IAS agents and discuss that by optimizing the set of associations the agents increase efficiency and performance. The second set of experiments is based on emulating an iDorm-like large-scale multi-society-based AIE environment. The results illustrate how embassadors discover strongly correlated agent pairs and cause them to form associations so that relevant agents of separate societies can start interacting with each other.",

Training a model of such agents to produce an emergent behavior by specification of the emergent (as opposed to agent) behavior is easier from a demonstration perspective. While many approaches involve manual behavior specification via code or reliance on a defined taxonomy of possible behaviors, the meta-modeling framework in Miner [2010] generates mapping functions between agent-level parameters and swarm-level parameters, which are re-usable once generated. This work builds on that framework by integrating demonstration by image or video. The demonstrator specifies spatial motion of the agents over time and retrieves agent-level parameters required to execute that motion. The framework, at its core, uses computationally cheap image-processing algorithms. Our work is tested with a combination of primitive visual feature extraction methods (contour area and shape) and features generated using a pre-trained deep neural network in different stages of image featurization. The framework is also evaluated for its potential using complex visual features for all image featurization stages. Experimental results show significant coherence between demonstrated behavior and predicted behavior based on estimated agent-level parameters specific to the spatial arrangement of agents.",

On one hand, the flexibility in managing virtual resources has enabled developers to efficiently manage their costs; they can easily remove unnecessary resources or add resources temporarily when the demand increases. On the other hand, the volatility of such environment and the velocity with which changes can occur may have a greater impact on the economic position of a stakeholder and the business balance of the overall ecosystem. In this work, we recognise the business ecosystem of cloud computing as an economy of scale and explore the effect of this fact on decisions concerning scaling the infrastructure of web applications to account for fluctuations in demand. The goal is to reveal and formalize opportunities for economically optimal scaling that takes into account not only the cost of infrastructure but also the revenue from service delivery and eventually the profit of the service provider. The end product is a scaling mechanism that makes decisions based on both performance and economic criteria and takes adaptive actions to optimize both performance and profitability for the system.",

    "abstract": "Many big-data processing jobs use data-analytics frameworks such as Apache Hadoop (currently also known as YARN). Such frameworks have tunable configuration parameters set by experienced system administrators and/or job developers. However, tuning parameters manually can be hard and time-consuming because it requires domain-specific knowledge and understanding of complex inter-dependencies among parameters. Most of the frameworks seek efficient resource management by assigning resource units to jobs, the maximum number of units allowed in a system being part of the static configuration of the system. This static resource management has limited effectiveness in coping with job diversity and workload dynamics, even in the case of a single job. The work reported in this article seeks to improve performance (e.g., multiple-jobs makespan and job completion time) without modification of either the framework or the applications and avoiding problems of previous self-tuning approaches based on performance models or resource usage. These problems include (1) the need for time-consuming training, typically offline and (2) unsuitability for multi-jobs/tenant environments. This article proposes a hierarchical self-tuning approach using (1) a fuzzy-logic controller to dynamically adjust the maximum number of concurrent jobs and (2) additional controllers (one for each cluster node) to adjust the maximum number of resource units assigned to jobs on each node. The fuzzy-logic controller uses fuzzy rules based on a concave-downward relationship between aggregate CPU usage and the number of concurrent jobs. The other controllers use a heuristic algorithm to adjust the number of resource units on the basis of both CPU and disk IO usage by jobs. To manage the maximum number of available resource units in each node, the controllers also take resource usage by other processes (e.g., system processes) into account. A prototype of our approach was implemented for Apache Hadoop on a cluster running at CloudLab. The proposed approach was demonstrated and evaluated with workloads composed of jobs with similar resource usage patterns as well as other realistic mixed-pattern workloads synthesized by SWIM, a statistical workload injector for MapReduce. The evaluation shows that the proposed approach yields up to a 48% reduction of the jobs makespan that results from using Hadoop-default settings.",

    "abstract": "Teaching by demonstrations and teaching by assigning rewards are two popular methods of knowledge transfer in humans. However, showing the right behaviour (by demonstration) may appear more natural to a human teacher than assessing the learner’s performance and assigning a reward or punishment to it. In the context of robot learning, the preference between these two approaches has not been studied extensively. In this article, we propose a method that replaces the traditional method of reward assignment with action assignment (which is similar to providing a demonstration) in interactive reinforcement learning. The main purpose of the suggested action is to compute a reward by seeing if the suggested action was followed by the self-acting agent or not. We compared action assignment with reward assignment via a user study conducted over the web using a two-dimensional maze game. The logs of interactions showed that action assignment significantly improved users’ ability to teach the right behaviour. The survey results showed that both action and reward assignment seemed highly natural and usable, reward assignment required more mental effort, repeatedly assigning rewards and seeing the agent disobey commands caused frustration in users, and many users desired to control the agent’s behaviour directly.",

    "abstract": "Coalition formation has been a fundamental form of resource cooperation for achieving joint goals in multiagent systems. Most existing studies still focus on the traditional assumption that an agent has to contribute its resources to all the goals, even if the agent is not interested in the goal at all. In this article, a natural extension of the traditional coalitional resource games (CRGs) is studied from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, in which each agent has uncompromising, personalized preferences over goals. Specifically, a new CRGs model with agents’ strict preferences for goals is presented, in which an agent is willing to contribute its resources only to the goals that are in its own interest set. The computational complexity of the basic decision problems surrounding the successful coalition is reinvestigated. The results suggest that these problems in such a strict preference way are complex and intractable. To find the largest successful coalition for possible computation reduction or potential parallel processing, a flow-network–based exhaust algorithm, called FNetEA, is proposed to achieve the optimal solution. Then, to solve the problem more efficiently, a hybrid algorithm, named 2D-HA, is developed to find the approximately optimal solution on the basis of genetic algorithm, two-dimensional (2D) solution representation, and a heuristic for solution repairs. Through extensive experiments, the 2D-HA algorithm exhibits the prominent ability to provide reassurances that the optimal solution could be found within a reasonable period of time, even in a super-large-scale space.",

Environmental uncertainty arises when run-time conditions diverge from design-time training conditions. To address this problem, automated methods can generate synthetic data to fill in gaps for training and test data coverage. We propose an evolution-based technique to assist developers with uncovering limitations in existing data when previously unseen environmental phenomena are introduced. This technique explores unique contexts for a given environmental condition, with an emphasis on diversity. Synthetic data generated by this technique may be used for two purposes: (1) to assess the robustness of a system to uncertain environmental factors and (2) to improve the system’s robustness.

This goal is challenged by several system features such as arbitrary system states after faults, various process execution models, and constrained process communication means. This work designs self-stabilizing distributed algorithms from the perspective of game theory, achieving an intended system goal through private goals of processes. We propose a generic game design for identifying a maximal independent set (MIS) or a maximal weighted independent set (MWIS) among all processes in a distributed system. From the generic game several specific games can be defined which differ in whether and how neighboring players influence each other. Turning the game designs into self-stabilizing algorithms, we obtain the first algorithms for the MWIS problem and also the first self-stabilizing MIS algorithm that considers node degree (including an analysis of its performance ratio). We also show how to handle simultaneous moves of processes in some process execution models. Simulation results indicate that, for various representative network topologies, the new algorithm outperforms existing methods in terms of MIS size and convergence rate. For the MWIS problem, the new algorithms performed only slightly worse than centralized greedy counterparts.",

    "abstract": "One of the main characteristics of open distributed embedded systems is that the involved entities are often very dynamic—different individual entities may join or leave the systems frequently. Therefore, systems built of these dynamic entities must be runtime reconfigurable. In addition, large classes of open embedded systems often have high availability and dependability requirements. However, the openness makes these requirements more difficult to achieve and the system more vulnerable to attacks. This article presents a coordination model, the Actor, Role and Coordinator (ARC) model, that aims to support reconfigurability and fault localization for open distributed embedded software systems. In particular, the actor model is used to model concurrent embedded entities, while the system's reconfigurability and dependability requirements are encapsulated within coordination objects: roles and coordinators, and are achieved through coordination among the actors. Roles, as a key thrust in the ARC model not only represent an abstraction for a set of behaviors shared by a group of actors so that reconfiguration within the roles becomes transparent to entities outside the roles, but also assume coordination responsibilities among the member actors. The article also argues from both analytical and empirical perspectives that with the support of the role, faults can be localized within actors, and actor level reconfiguration becomes transparent to the system.",

    "abstract": "In Dynamic Service Composition (DSC), an application can be dynamically composed using web services to achieve its functional and Quality of Services (QoS) goals. DSC is a relatively mature area of research that crosscuts autonomous and services computing. Complex autonomous and self-adaptive computing paradigms (e.g., multi-tenant cloud services, mobile/smart services, services discovery and composition in intelligent environments such as smart cities) have been leveraging DSC to dynamically and adaptively maintain the desired QoS, cost and to stabilize long-lived software systems. While DSC is fundamentally known to be an NP-hard problem, systematic attempts to analyze its scalability have been limited, if not absent, though such analysis is of a paramount importance for their effective, efficient, and stable operations. This article reports on a new application of goal-modeling, providing a systematic technique that can support DSC designers and architects in identifying DSC-relevant characteristics and metrics that can potentially affect the scalability goals of a system. The article then applies the technique to two different approaches for QoS-aware dynamic services composition, where the article describes two detailed exemplars that exemplify its application. The exemplars hope to provide researchers and practitioners with guidance and transferable knowledge in situations where the scalability analysis may not be straightforward. The contributions provide architects and designers for QoS-aware dynamic service composition with the fundamentals for assessing the scalability of their own solutions, along with goal models and a list of application domain characteristics and metrics that might be relevant to other solutions. Our experience has shown that the technique was able to identify in both exemplars application domain characteristics and metrics that had been overlooked in previous scalability analyses of these DSC, some of which indeed limited their scalability. It has also shown that the experiences and knowledge can be transferable: The first exemplar was used as an example to inform and ease the work of applying the technique in the second one, reducing the time to create the model, even for a non-expert.",

Unfortunately, the simplicity of agents and the complexity of modeling do not fit together, thus demanding for a third party to bridge the gap. Given the opportunities in the field, the main contributions of this work are twofold: (1) we propose a general methodology to model resource consumption trends and (2) we implemented it into MARC, a Cloud-service platform that produces Models-as-a-Service, thus relieving self-aware agents from the burden of building their custom modeling framework. In order to validate the proposed methodology, we set up a custom simulator to generate a wide spectrum of controlled traces: this allowed us to verify the correctness of our framework from a general and comprehensive point of view.",

    "abstract": "In today’s Internet, the commercial aspects of routing are gaining importance. Current technology allows Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to renegotiate contracts online to maximize profits. Changing link prices will influence interdomain routing policies that are now driven by monetary aspects as well as global resource and performance optimization. In this article, we consider an interdomain routing game in which the ISP’s action is to set the price for its transit links. Assuming a cheapest path routing scheme, the optimal action is the price setting that yields the highest utility (i.e., profit) and depends both on the network load and the actions of other ISPs. We adapt a continuous and a discrete action learning automaton (LA) to operate in this framework as a tool that can be used by ISP operators to learn optimal price setting. In our model, agents representing different ISPs learn only on the basis of local information and do not need any central coordination or sensitive information exchange. Simulation results show that a single ISP employing LAs is able to learn the optimal price in a stationary environment. By introducing a selective exploration rule, LAs are also able to operate in nonstationary environments. When two ISPs employ LAs, we show that they converge to stable and fair equilibrium strategies.",

    "abstract": "Self-organized systems typically consist of distributed autonomous entities. An increasing part of such systems is characterized by openness and heterogeneity of participants. For instance, open desktop computing grids provide a framework for unrestrictedly joining in. However, openness and heterogeneity present severe challenges to the overall system’s stability and efficiency since uncooperative and even malicious participants are free to join. A promising solution for this problem is to introduce technical trust as a basis; however, in turn, the utilization of trust opens space for negative emergent behavior. This article introduces a system-wide observation and control loop that influences the self-organized behavior to provide a performant and robust platform for benevolent participants. Thereby, the observation part is responsible for gathering information and deriving a system description. We introduce a graph-based approach to identify groups of suspicious or malicious agents and demonstrate that this clustering process is highly successful for the considered stereotype agent behaviors. In addition, the controller part guides the system behavior by issuing norms that make use of incentives and sanctions. We further present a concept for closing the control loop and show experimental results that highlight the potential benefit of establishing such a control loop.",

Putting theory into practice, however, faces certain obstacles, particularly in radio technologies that cannot implement pulses but use common messages for interactions between nodes. This raises the question of how to deal with interference between messages. We show that interference can disturb the synchronization process and propose low-complex, randomization-based techniques to address this issue. First, we demonstrate that randomly switching between two transmit power levels (without increasing the average power) can expedite synchronization. The high-power transmissions temporarily boost network connectivity with negligible impact on the average interference. Second, we reduce interference by blindly distributing the messages over the entire oscillator cycle. Instead of using a fixed oscillator phase at which the pulses are sent, each node chooses its own, randomly selected phase to send a synchronization message. This node-specific “fire phase” is contained in the message to permit others to compute the timing. Third, we suggest that such interference management can also be beneficial for other synchronization techniques and validate this claim using Glossy as an example. Our insights may contribute to feasible solutions for self-organized wireless synchronization. Further work is needed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the effects of randomization and to develop algorithms for the adaptability of local parameters.",

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor network (WSN) testbeds are useful because they provide a way to test applications in an environment that makes it easy to deploy experiments, configure them statically or dynamically, and gather performance information. However, WSNs are typically composed of low-cost devices and tend to be unreliable, with failures a common phenomenon. Accurate knowledge of network health status, including nodes and links of each type, is critical for correctly configuring applications on WSN testbeds and for interpreting the data collected from them. In this article we present a stabilizing protocol, Chowkidar, that provides accurate and efficient network health monitoring in WSNs. Our approach adapts the well-known problem of message-passing rooted spanning tree construction and its use in propagation of information with feedback (PIF) for the case of a WSN. The Chowkidar protocol is initiated upon demand; that is, it does not involve ongoing maintenance, and it terminates with accurate results, including detection of failure and restart during the monitoring process. Chowkidar is distinguished from others in two important ways. Given the resource constraints of WSNs, it is message-efficient in that it uses only a few messages per node. Also, it tolerates ongoing node and link failure and node restart, in contrast to requiring that faults stop during convergence. We have implemented the Chowkidar protocol as part of enabling a network health status service that is tightly integrated with a remotely accessible wireless sensor network testbed, Kansei, at The Ohio State University. We present experimental results from this testbed that validate the correctness and performance of Chowkidar. We also report on initial experiences and lessons learnt from the integration of Chowkidar with Kansei, including feedback from both testbed users and administrators who have found Chowkidar to be a useful tool for improving the accuracy and efficiency of testbed experimentation and maintenance, and the need for well-defined policies to address issues such as minimizing interference with concurrently running experiments. Finally, we discuss extensions that enhance the functionality and usability of Chowkidar.",

In the recently proposed “Internet of People” paradigm, accessing relevant data dynamically generated in the environment nearby is one of the key services. Moreover, personal mobile devices become proxies of their human users while exchanging data in the cyber world and, thus, largely use ONs and D2D communications for exchanging data directly. Recently, researchers have successfully demonstrated the viability of embedding human cognitive schemes in data dissemination algorithms for ONs. In this article, we consider one such scheme based on the recognition heuristic, a human decision-making scheme used to efficiently assess the relevance of data. While initial evidence about its effectiveness is available, the evaluation of its behaviour in large-scale settings is still unsatisfactory. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a novel hybrid modeling methodology that combines an analytical model of data dissemination within small-scale communities of mobile users, with detailed simulations of interactions between different communities. This methodology allows us to evaluate the algorithm in large-scale city- and countrywide scenarios. Results confirm the effectiveness of cognitive data dissemination schemes, even when content popularity is very heterogenous.",

In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where agents must cooperate with one another, a student could fail to cooperate effectively with others even by following a teacher’s suggested actions, as the policies of all agents can change before convergence. When the number of times that agents communicate with one another is limited (i.e., there are budget constraints), an advising strategy that uses actions as advice could be less effective. We propose a partaker-sharer advising framework (PSAF) for cooperative MARL agents learning with budget constraints. In PSAF, each Q-learner can decide when to ask for and share its Q-values. We perform experiments in three typical multi-agent learning problems. The evaluation results indicate that the proposed PSAF approach outperforms existing advising methods under both constrained and unconstrained budgets. Moreover, we analyse the influence of advising actions and sharing Q-values on agent learning.",

We prove that LDP-Basic can detect strong stable predicates, that LDP-Snapshot can detect all stable predicates, and discuss their applicability to various distributed programming domains and to spatial computing in general. LDP detection in bounded-degree networks is shown to be scale-free, making the approach particularly attractive for specific topologies, even though LDPs are less efficient than snapshot algorithms in general distributed systems.",

We present a fully decentralized, self-managing Resource Selection Service (RSS) algorithm by which resources autonomously select themselves when their attributes match a query. An application specifies what it expects from a resource by means of a conjunction of (attribute,value-range) pairs, which are matched against the attribute values of resources. The set of search attributes can also be updated online to reflect new requirements. We show that our solution scales in the number of resources and in the number of attributes, while being relatively insensitive to churn and other membership changes like node failures. Our RSS continuously self-adapts its routing structure in response to variations in the distribution of node attributes and queries. We show that this autonomous optimization maintains performance and availability in a long-lived service even when the set of application requirements used to select resources changes.",

Using interaction, agents communicate with each other and cooperatively execute complex tasks that are beyond the capability of a single agent. Cooperatively executing tasks may endanger the success of an agent if it attempts to cooperate with peers that are not proficient or reliable. Therefore, agents need to have an evaluation mechanism to select peers for cooperation. Trust is one of the measures commonly used to evaluate the effectiveness of agents in cooperative societies. Since all interactions are subject to uncertainty, the risk behavior of agents as a contextual factor needs to be taken into account in decision making. In this research, we propose the concept of adaptive risk and agent strategy along with an algorithm that helps agents make decisions in an self-adaptive society utilizing an agent’s own experience and recommendation-based trust. Trust-based decision making increases the profit of the system along with lower task failure in comparison to a no-trust model in which agents do not utilize evaluation mechanisms for choosing their cooperation peers.",

Multiagent distributed resource allocation requires that agents act on limited, localized information with minimum communication overhead in order to optimize the distribution of available resources. When requirements and constraints are dynamic, learning agents may be needed to allow for adaptation. One way of accomplishing learning is to observe past outcomes, using such information to improve future decisions. When limits in agents' memory or observation capabilities are assumed, one must decide on how large should the observation window be. We investigate how this decision influences both agents' and system's performance in the context of a special class of distributed resource allocation problems, namely dispersion games. We show by using several numerical experiments over a specific dispersion game (the Minority Game) that in such scenario an agent's performance is non-monotonically correlated with her memory size when all other agents are kept unchanged. We then provide an information-theoretic explanation for the observed behaviors, showing that a downward causation effect takes place.",

In contrast, recent research has focused increasingly on an alternative paradigm, inspired largely by the nest building behavior of social insects, in which components “self-assemble” into a given target structure. Adapting such a nature-inspired approach to precisely self-assemble artificial structures (bridge, building, etc.) presents a formidable challenge: one must create a set of local control rules to direct the behavior of the individual components/agents during the self-assembly process. In recent work, we developed a fully automated procedure that generates such rules, allowing a given structure to successfully self-assemble in a simulated environment having constrained, continuous motion; however, the resulting rule sets were typically quite large. In this article, we present a more effective methodology for automatic rule generation, which makes an attempt to parsimoniously capture both the repeating patterns that exist within a structure, and the behaviors necessary for appropriate coordination. We then empirically show that the procedure developed here generates sets of rules that are not only correct, but significantly reduced in size, relative to our earlier approach. Such rule sets allow for simpler agents that are nonetheless still capable of performing complex tasks, and therefore demonstrate the problem-solving potential of self-organized systems.",

    "abstract": "A central problem in swarm robotics is to design a controller that will allow the member robots of the swarm to collectively perform a given task. Of particular interest in massively distributed applications are reactive controllers with severely limited computational and sensory abilities. In this article, we give the results of the first computational complexity analysis of the reactive swarm design problem. Our core results are derived relative to a generalization of what is arguably the simplest possible type of reactive controller, the so-called computation-free controller proposed by Gauci et al., which operates in grid-based environments in a noncontinuous manner. We show that the design of a generalized computation-free swarm for an arbitrary given task in an arbitrary given environment is not polynomial-time solvable either in general or by the most desirable types of approximation algorithms (including evolutionary algorithms with high probabilities of producing correct solutions) but is solvable in effectively polynomial time relative to several types of restrictions on swarms, environments, and tasks. All of our results hold for the design of several more complex types of generalized computation-free swarms. Moreover, all of our intractability and inapproximability results hold for the design of any type of reactive swarm (including those based on the popular feed-forward neural network and Brooks-style subsumption controllers) operating in grid-based environments in a noncontinuous manner whose member robots satisfy two simple conditions. As such, our results give the first theoretical survey of the types of efficient exact and approximate solution algorithms that are and are not possible for designing several types of reactive swarms.",

However, despite the ubiquity of group formation, a well-founded measure of added value has remained elusive. Here, we propose such a measure inspired by the Shapley value —a fundamental solution concept from Cooperative Game Theory. To this end, we start by developing a solution concept that measures the average impact of each player in a coalitional game and show how this measure uniquely satisfies a set of intuitive properties. Then, building upon our solution concept, we propose a measure of added value that not only analyzes the interactions of players inside their group, but also outside it, thereby reflecting otherwise-hidden information about how these individuals typically perform in various groups of the population.",

Resilience on TF problems aims to provide robustness and adaptability to unforeseen events involving agent deletion. However, agents are unaware of the inherent social welfare in these teams. This article tackles the problem of how teams can minimise their effort in terms of organisation and communication considering these dynamics. Our main contribution is twofold: first, we introduce the Stabilisable Team Formation (STF) as a generalisation of current resilient TF model, where a team is stabilisable if it possesses and preserves its inter-agent organisation from a graph-based perspective. Second, our experiments show that stabilisability is able to reduce the exponential execution time in several units of magnitude with the most restrictive configurations, proving that communication effort in subsequent task allocation problems are relaxed compared with current resilient teams. To do so, we developed SBB-ST, a branch-and-bound algorithm based on Distributed Constrained Optimisation Problems (DCOP) to compute teams. Results evidence that STF improves their predecessors, extends the resilience to subsequent task allocation problems represented as DCOP, and evidence how Stabilisability contributes to resilient TF problems by anticipating decisions for saving resources and minimising the effort on team organisation in dynamic scenarios.",

Consequently, in this article, we strive to mitigate these problems by leveraging an adaptive controller, which is composed of a neural network as the performance model and a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller as the scaling engine. More specifically, we design, implement, and analyze different flavours of these adaptive and non-adaptive controllers, and we compare and contrast them against each other to find the most suitable one for managing containerized cloud software systems at runtime. The controller’s objective is to maintain the response time of the controlled software system in a pre-defined range, and meeting the Service-level Agreements, while leading to efficient resource provisioning.",

This can be useful in look ahead optimization and in adaptations using complex models, such as machine learning. We formally prove the safety and liveness properties of the implemented distributed algorithms. Through experiments on the Amazon AWS cloud, using two different use cases, we demonstrate the elasticity and flexibility of the autonomic manager as a measure of its applicability to different cloud applications with different types of workloads.

This is achieved via the use of self-adaptive systems and through the execution of adaptation tactics, such as model retraining , which operate at the level of individual ML components. To address this problem, we propose a probabilistic modeling framework that reasons about the cost/benefit tradeoffs associated with adapting ML components. The key idea of the proposed approach is to decouple the problems of estimating (1) the expected performance improvement after adaptation and (2) the impact of ML adaptation on overall system utility. We apply the proposed framework to engineer a self-adaptive ML-based fraud detection system, which we evaluate using a publicly available, real fraud detection dataset. We initially consider a scenario in which information on the model’s quality is immediately available. Next, we relax this assumption by integrating (and extending) state-of-the-art techniques for estimating the model’s quality in the proposed framework. We show that by predicting the system utility stemming from retraining an ML component, the probabilistic model checker can generate adaptation strategies that are significantly closer to the optimal, as compared against baselines such as periodic or reactive retraining.",

Meanwhile, machine learning (ML) has been applied to enhance analysis and plan functions of MAPE so that self-adaptive systems have optimal adaption to changing conditions. However, most of ML-based approaches don’t utilize CAVs’ connectivity to collaboratively generate an optimal learner for MAPE, because of sensor data threatened by gradient leakage attack (GLA). In this article, we first design an intelligent architecture for MAPE-based self-adaptive systems on Web 3.0-based CAVs, in which a collaborative machine learner supports the capabilities of managing systems. Then, we observe by practical experiments that importance sampling of sparse vector technique (SVT) approaches cannot defend GLA well. Next, we propose a fine-grained SVT approach to secure the learner in MAPE-based self-adaptive systems, that uses layer and gradient sampling to select uniform and important gradients. At last, extensive experiments show that our private learner spends a slight utility cost for MAPE (e.g., \\(0.77\\%\\) decrease in accuracy) defending GLA and outperforms the typical SVT approaches in terms of defense (increased by \\(10\\%\\sim 14\\%\\) attack success rate) and utility (decreased by \\(1.29\\%\\) accuracy loss).",

However, these vehicles often face limitations in terms of local computing resources, leading to the need for offloading interactive-intensive application tasks to servers for processing. Traditional paradigm has its limitations in meeting the demands of massive task processing. The combination of Web3.0 and edge computing offers users high-reliable, low-latency, and highly flexible services. Nevertheless, the new paradigm also presents its own challenges such as ensuring privacy data protection, and reducing the time and energy costs associated with task offloading. To tackle these challenges, a edge task offloading framework based on consortium blockchain for CAVs has been developed. Within this framework, a consortium blockchain-based interaction-intensive task offloading method, called CBIToMe, has been designed. CBIToMe specifically addresses the multi-stage nature of interactive-intensive CAV tasks and aims to minimize task completion time and offloading costs, particularly when the waiting time for interaction is uncertain. Additionally, CBIToMe effectively utilizes consortium blockchain technology to safeguard the CAV privacy data. Results from experiments conducted in various scenarios demonstrate that CBIToMe outperforms three representative methods, showcasing its superior performance.",

However, learning a fair equilibrium is crucial for the sustainability and stability of collaboration in the long-term coordination game, especially when the leadership competition exists. In this paper, we propose the bi-level reinforcement learning method N-Bi-AC, whose solution is a Pareto improvement for traditional NE, to choose a fair Equilibrium. There are two parts in our method, the first is that we propose the Negotiator to determine the leader in stage game, and the other is to update the Q-value of agents in the game by using a bi-level actor-critic learning method based on the Joint Mixed Strategy Equilibrium Q-learning algorithm (JMSE Q-learning). The convergence proof is given, and the learning algorithm is compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.

In this paper, we introduce a piecewise weighting method that incorporates hyper-class representation to enhance collaborative filtering recommendations. Our approach begins with applying a kernel function to map the original data into a kernel space, facilitating the learning of attribute weights. Subsequently, we construct a hyper-class representation of the data to derive weights for segmented attribute values (hyper-classes) within each attribute, creating a piecewise weighting function. This piecewise weighting function is then utilized to compute user similarities for collaborative filtering recommendations. Finally, we conduct a series of experiments to assess the performance of the collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm, employing the piecewise weighting function, outperforms the compared algorithm that uses fixed weight values, as assessed by Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Precision.

Model verification at runtime supports adaptation through the periodic analysis of continually updated models. A major limitation of the technique is the high overhead associated with the regular analyses of large state-space models. Our paper introduces an adaptive approximation strategy that tackles this limitation by delaying unnecessary model updates, significantly reducing the overheads of these analyses. The strategy is applicable to Markov decision processes (MDPs) and is partitioned into components that can be analyzed independently and approximately. Each component is assigned a priority that depends on its impact on the accuracy of verification, and only the highest-priority components affected by changes are scheduled for updating/approximating. A complete update and verification of the entire model is triggered infrequently when the accuracy drops below a predefined threshold. We provide theoretical guarantees and proofs which ensure that our strategy can be applied without impacting the overall safety of the verified autonomous system. The experimental results from a case study in which we applied the strategy to a rescue robot team show that it is fully robust against safety-critical errors and can achieve a decision accuracy of over 97%.",

Existing methods mainly focus on centralized QoS prediction while paying little attention to distributed mobile QoS prediction, making it challenging to protect user privacy information when invoking Web services. Moreover, even though some advanced centralized methods can be transformed into federated architectures, they often face difficulty in capturing latent feature representations of users and services and learning personalized prediction layers between them due to the heterogeneity of the QoS dataset. To address the above issues, we propose a novel framework for distributed QoS prediction, called Combining Personalized F ederated H ypernetworks and Shared R esidual Learning for D istributed Q oS P rediction (FHR-DQP). FHR-DQP adopts the federated averaging (FedAvg) to aggregate location-aware residual shared feature information across all clients. Additionally, a hypernetwork is leveraged to generate personalized networks for user-service QoS prediction in each client. These components are integrated as a hybrid framework that performs training using a federated approach and makes personalized QoS predictions within each client. Extensive experiments are conducted on a real-world benchmark QoS dataset called WS-DREAM, containing nearly 2,000,000 historical QoS invocation records. Compared with both centralized and federated competing baselines, the results demonstrate that FHR-DQP achieves the highest performance for distributed QoS prediction, when it provides privacy-preserving of users’ QoS invocations.",

Most self-adaptation approaches today use decision-making mechanisms that select for execution the adaptation option with the best-estimated benefit expressed as a set of adaptation goals. A few approaches also consider the estimated (one-off) cost of executing the candidate adaptation options. We argue that besides benefit and cost, decision-making in self-adaptive systems should also consider the estimated risk the system or its users would be exposed to if an adaptation option were selected for execution. Balancing all three concerns when evaluating the options for adaptation to mitigate uncertainty is essential for satisfying stakeholders’ concerns and ensuring the safety and public acceptance of self-adaptive systems. In this paper, we present a reference model for decision-making in self-adaptation that considers the estimated benefit, cost, and risk as core concerns of each adaptation option. Leveraging this model, we then present an ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 compatible architectural viewpoint that aims at supporting software architects responsible for designing robust decision-making mechanisms for self-adaptive systems. We demonstrate the applicability, usefulness, and understandability of the viewpoint through a case study where participants with experience in the engineering of self-adaptive systems performed a set of design tasks in DeltaIoT, an Internet-of-Things exemplar for research on self-adaptive systems.",

Among the critical microservice architecture design decisions is when to adapt the granularity of a microservice architecture by merging/decomposing microservices. No existing work investigates the following question: How can we reason about the trade-off between predicted benefits and cost of pursuing microservice granularity adaptation under uncertainty? To address this question, we provide a novel formulation of the decision problem to pursue granularity adaptation as a real options problem. We propose a novel evaluation process for dynamically evaluating granularity adaptation design decisions under uncertainty. Our process is based on a novel combination of real options and the concept of Bayesian surprises. We show the benefits of our evaluation process by comparing it to four representative industrial microservice runtime monitoring tools, which can be used for retrospective evaluation for granularity adaptation decisions. Our comparison shows that our process can supersede and/or complement these tools. We implement a microservice application—Filmflix—using Amazon Web Service Lambda and use this implementation as a case study to show the unique benefit of our process compared to traditional application of real options analysis.",

Recent successful approaches translate the partially observable contingent problem into a non-deterministic fully observable problem, and then use a planner for non-deterministic planning. However, the translation may become very large, encumbering the task of the non-deterministic planner. We suggest a different approach—using an online contingent solver repeatedly to construct a plan tree. We execute the plan returned by the online solver until the next observation action, and then branch on the possible observed values, and replan for every branch independently. In many cases a plan tree can have an exponential width in the number of state variables, but the tree may have a structure that allows us to compactly represent it using a directed graph. We suggest a mechanism for tailoring such a graph that reduces both the computational effort and the storage space. Our method also handles non-deterministic domains, by identifying cycles in the plans. We present a set of experiments, showing our approach to scale better than state-of-the-art offline planners.",

    "abstract": "P2P-like applications are quickly gaining popularity in the Internet. Such applications are commonly modeled as graphs with nodes and edges. Usually nodes represent running processes that exchange information with each other through communication channels as represented by the edges. They often need to autonomously determine their suitable working mode or local status for the purpose of improving performance, reducing operation cost, or achieving system-level design goals. In order to achieve this objective, the concept of status configuration is introduced in this article and a mathematical correspondence is further established between status configuration and an optimization index ( OI ), which serves as a unified abstraction of any system design goals. Guided by this correspondence and inspired by the cross-entropy algorithm, a cross-entropy-driven self-organization mechanism (CESM) is proposed in this article. CESM exhibits the self-organization property since desirable status configurations that lead to high OI values will quickly emerge from purely localized interactions. Both theoretical and experimental analysis have been performed. The results strongly indicate that CESM is a simple yet effective technique which is potentially suitable for many P2P-like applications.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of smartphones has given rise to urban-area applications: applications that communicate in a city by means of the public (moving) infrastructure (e.g., buses and trams). In this setting, applications need to communicate with and discover each other using intermediaries that move around the city and transfer data between them. This requires programmers to scatter code that deals with routing messages to the correct place and deal with network failures all over their programs. Our approach allows the programmer to specify urban-area applications in a high-level manner without the burden of directly encoding communication using intermediaries. We present this as a translation from a high-level object-oriented programming paradigm to a low-level communication mechanism. This translation allows the programmer to restrict routing of messages to, for example, a certain number of hops, geographic areas, or even types of carrier devices. In addition, we show how high-level group messaging can be efficiently represented in the low-level communication. Finally, we document our experiences in setting up a small-scale real-world urban-area application.",

    "abstract": "The fast-spreading worm, which immediately propagates itself after a successful infection, is becoming one of the most serious threats to today’s networked information systems. In this article, we present WormTerminator, a host-based solution for fast Internet worm detection and containment with the assistance of virtual machine techniques based on the fast-worm defining characteristic. In WormTerminator, a virtual machine cloning the host OS runs in parallel to the host OS. Thus, the virtual machine has the same set of vulnerabilities as the host. Any outgoing traffic from the host is diverted through the virtual machine. If the outgoing traffic from the host is for fast worm propagation, the virtual machine should be infected and will exhibit worm propagation pattern very quickly because a fast-spreading worm will start to propagate as soon as it successfully infects a host. To prove the concept, we have implemented a prototype of WormTerminator and have examined its effectiveness against the real Internet worm Linux/Slapper. Our empirical results confirm that WormTerminator is able to completely contain worm propagation in real-time without blocking any non-worm traffic. The major performance cost of WormTerminator is a one-time delay to the start of each outgoing normal connection for worm detection. To reduce the performance overhead, caching is utilized, through which WormTerminator will delay no more than 6% normal outgoing traffic for such detection on average.",

Accordingly, this paper considers fault monitoring as a latent factors discovery problem. In the context of end-to-end probing, the goal is to devise an efficient sampling policy that makes the best use of a constrained sampling budget. Previous work addresses fault monitoring in a collaborative prediction framework, where the information is a snapshot of the probes outcomes. Here, we take into account the fact that the system dynamically evolves at various time scales. We propose and evaluate Sequential Matrix Factorization (SMF) that exploits both the recent advances in matrix factorization for the instantaneous information and a new sampling heuristics based on historical information. The effectiveness of the SMF approach is exemplified on datasets of increasing difficulty and compared with state of the art history-based or snapshot-based methods. In all cases, strong adaptivity under the specific flavor of active learning is required to unleash the full potential of coupling the most confident and the most uncertain sampling heuristics, which is the cornerstone of SMF.",

In particular, self-management and adaptation of runtime platforms have been common research themes, as most of these systems run under dynamic conditions. Nevertheless, the research landscape in this area is still young and fragmented. Most research is performed in the context of specific systems, and it is difficult to generalize the results obtained to other contexts. To enable generic and reusable CEP/SP system management procedures and self-management policies, this research introduces the Attributed Graph Rewriting for Complex Event Processing Management ( AGeCEP ) formalism. AGeCEP represents queries in a language- and technology-agnostic fashion using attributed graphs. Query reconfiguration capabilities are expressed through standardized attributes, which are defined based on a novel classification of CEP query operators. By leveraging this representation, AGeCEP also proposes graph rewriting rules to define consistent reconfigurations of queries. To demonstrate AGeCEP feasibility, this research has used it to design an autonomic manager and to define a selected set of self-management policies. Finally, experiments demonstrate that AGeCEP can indeed be used to develop algorithms that can be integrated into diverse CEP systems.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous systems are often used in applications where environmental and internal changes may lead to requirement violations. Adapting to these changes proactively, i.e., before the violations occur, is preferable to recovering from the failures that may be caused by such violations. However, proactive adaptation needs methods for predicting requirement violations timely, accurately, and with acceptable overheads. To address this need, we present a method that allows autonomous systems to predict violations of performance, dependability and other nonfunctional requirements, and therefore take preventative measures to avoid or otherwise mitigate them. Our method for pre dicting these autonomou s sys t em disrupti o ns (PRESTO) comprises a design time stage and a run-time stage. At design-time, we use parametric model checking to obtain algebraic expressions that formalise the relationships between the nonfunctional properties of the requirements of interest (e.g., reliability, response time, and energy use) and the parameters of the system and its environment. At run-time, we predict future changes in these parameters by applying piece-wise linear regression to online data obtained through monitoring, and we use the algebraic expressions to predict the impact of these changes on the system requirements. We demonstrate the application of PRESTO through simulation in case studies from two different domains.",

Adding self-adaptive capabilities to these communication systems is one approach to reducing administrative effort and coping with changing execution contexts. Existing frameworks can help reducing development effort but are neither tailored toward the use in communication systems nor easily usable without knowledge in self-adaptive systems development. Accordingly, in previous work, we proposed REACT, a reusable, model-based runtime environment to complement communication systems with adaptive behavior. REACT addresses heterogeneity and distribution aspects of such systems and reduces development effort. In this article, we propose REACT-ION—an extension of REACT for situation awareness. REACT-ION offers a context management module that is able to acquire, store, disseminate, and reason on context data. The context management module is the basis for (i) proactive adaptation with REACT-ION and (ii) self-improvement of the underlying feedback loop. REACT-ION can be used to optimize adaptation decisions at runtime based on the current situation. Therefore, it can cope with uncertainty and situations that were not foreseeable at design time. We show and evaluate in two case studies how REACT-ION’s situation awareness enables proactive adaptation and self-improvement.",

    "abstract": "Autonomic communications aim at easing the burden of managing complex and dynamic networks, and designing adaptive, self-turning and self-stabilizing networks to provide much needed flexibility and functional scalability. With the ever-increasing number of multicast applications made recently, considerable efforts have been focused on the design of adaptive flow control schemes for autonomic multicast services. The main difficulties in designing an adaptive flow controller for autonomic multicast service are caused by heterogeneous multicast receivers, especially those with large propagation delays, since the feedback arriving at the source is somewhat outdated and can be harmful to the control operations. To tackle the preceding problem, this article describes a novel, adaptive, and autonomic multicast scheme, the so-called Proportional, Integrative, Derivative plus Neural Network (PIDNN) predictive technique, which consists of two components: the Proportional Integrative plus Derivative (PID) controller and the Back Propagation BP Neural Network (BPNN). In this integrated scheme, the PID controllers are located at the next upstream main branch nodes of the multicast receivers, and have explicit rate algorithms to regulate the receiving rates of the receivers; while the BPNN is located at the multicast source, and predicts the available bandwidth of those longer delay receivers to compute the expected rates of the longer delay receivers. The ultimate sending rate of the multicast source is the maximum of the aforesaid receiving rates that can be accommodated by its participating branches. This network-assisted property is different from the existing control schemes, in that the PIDNN controller can release the irresponsiveness of a multicast flow caused by those long propagation delays from the receivers. By using BPNN, this active scheme makes the control more responsive to the receivers with longer propagation delay. Thus the rate adaptation can be performed in a timely manner, for the sender to respond to network congestion quickly. We analyze the theoretical aspects of the proposed algorithm, show how the control mechanism can be used to design a controller to support multirate multicast transmission based on feedback of explicit rates, and verify this matching using simulations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PIDNN controller avoids overflow of multicast traffic, and performs better than the existing scheme PNN [Tan et al. 2005] and the multicast schemes based on control theory. Moreover, it also performs well in the sense that it achieves high link utilization, quick response, good scalability, high unitary throughput, intra-session fairness and inter-session fairness.",

    "abstract": "Existing studies on the multirobot foraging problem often assume safe settings, in which nothing in an environment hinders the robots’ tasks. In many real-world applications, robots have to collect objects from hazardous environments like earthquake rescue, where possible risks exist, with possibilities of destroying robots. At this stage, there are no targeted algorithms for foraging robots in hazardous environments, which can lead to damage to the robot itself and reduce the final foraging efficiency. A motivating example is a rescue scenario, in which the lack of a suitable solution results in many victims not being rescued after all available robots have been destroyed. Foraging robots face a dilemma after some robots have been destroyed: whether to take over tasks of the destroyed robots or continue executing their remaining foraging tasks. The challenges that arise when attempting such a balance are twofold: (1) the loss of robots adds new constraints to traditional problems, complicating the structure of the solution space, and (2) the task allocation strategy in a multirobot team affects the final expected utility, thereby increasing the dimension of the solution space. In this study, we address these challenges in two fundamental environmental settings: homogeneous and heterogeneous cases. For the former case, a decomposition and grafting mechanism is adopted to split this problem into two weakly coupled problems: the foraging task execution problem and the foraging task allocation problem. We propose an exact foraging task allocation algorithm, and graft it to another exact foraging task execution algorithm to find an optimal solution within the polynomial time. For the latter case, it is proven \\( \\mathcal {NP} \\) -hard to find an optimal solution in polynomial time. The decomposition and grafting mechanism is also adopted here, and our proposed greedy risk-aware foraging algorithm is grafted to our proposed hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm to find high-utility solutions with low computational overhead. Finally, these algorithms are extensively evaluated through simulations, demonstrating that compared with various benchmarks, they can significantly increase the utility of objects returned by robots before all the robots have been stopped.",

    "abstract": "Many self-adaptive systems benefit from human involvement and oversight, where a human operator can provide expertise not available to the system and detect problems that the system is unaware of. One way of achieving this synergy is by placing the human operator on the loop —i.e., providing supervisory oversight and intervening in the case of questionable adaptation decisions. To make such interaction effective, an explanation can play an important role in allowing the human operator to understand why the system is making certain decisions and improve the level of knowledge that the operator has about the system. This, in turn, may improve the operator’s capability to intervene and, if necessary, override the decisions being made by the system. However, explanations may incur costs, in terms of delay in actions and the possibility that a human may make a bad judgment. Hence, it is not always obvious whether an explanation will improve overall utility and, if so, then what kind of explanation should be provided to the operator. In this work, we define a formal framework for reasoning about explanations of adaptive system behaviors and the conditions under which they are warranted. Specifically, we characterize explanations in terms of explanation content , effect , and cost . We then present a dynamic system adaptation approach that leverages a probabilistic reasoning technique to determine when an explanation should be used to improve overall system utility. We evaluate our explanation framework in the context of a realistic industrial control system with adaptive behaviors.",

However, the uncertainty of information (with regard to incompleteness, vagueness, and dynamics) in self-organizing systems makes it difficult for them to work appropriately in accordance with the network state. In this study, we apply a model of the collective decision-making of animal groups to enable self-organizing control mechanisms to adapt to information uncertainty. Specifically, we apply a mathematical model of collective decision-making that is known as the effective leadership model (ELM). In the ELM, informed individuals (those who are experienced or well-informed) take the role of leading the others. In contrast, uninformed individuals (those who perceive only local information) follow neighboring individuals. As a result of the collective behavior of informed/uninformed individuals, the animal group achieves consensus. We consider a self-organizing control mechanism using potential-based routing with an optimal control, and propose a mechanism for determining a data-packet forwarding scheme based on the ELM. Through evaluation by simulation, we show that, in a situation in which the perceived information is incomplete and dynamic, nodes can forward data packets in accordance with the network state by applying the ELM.",

Previous monitoring methods have deficiencies in either adaptivity to dynamic events or simple but effective path coordination mechanisms, and they are inapplicable to the large-area, low-target-density, and long-duration persistent counter-piracy monitoring. This article proposes a self-organized UAV swarm counter-piracy monitoring method. Based on the pheromone map, this method is characterized by (1) a reservation mechanism for anticipatory path coordination and (2) a ship-adaptive mechanism for adapting to merchant ship distributions. A heuristic depth-first branch and bound search algorithm is designed for solving individual path planning. Simulation experiments are conducted to study the optimal number of plan steps and adaptivity scaling factor for different numbers of UAVs. Results show that merely decreasing revisit intervals cannot effectively reduce pirate attacks. Without the ship-adaptive mechanism, the proposed method reduces up to 87.2%, 43.2%, and 5.5% of revisit intervals compared to the Lèvy Walk method, the sweep method, and the baseline self-organized method, respectively, but cannot reduce pirate attacks; while with the ship-adaptive mechanism, the proposed method can reduce pirate attacks by up to 6.7% compared to the best of the baseline methods.",

    "abstract": "The size of sensor networks supporting smart cities is ever increasing. Sensor network resiliency becomes vital for critical networks such as emergency response and waste water treatment. One approach is to engineer “self-aware” sensors that can proactively change their component composition in response to changes in work load when critical devices fail. By extension, these devices could anticipate their own termination, such as battery depletion, and offload current tasks onto connected devices. These neighboring devices can then reconfigure themselves to process these tasks, thus avoiding catastrophic network failure. In this article, we compare and contrast two types of self-aware sensors. One set uses Q-learning to develop a policy that guides device reaction to various environmental stimuli, whereas the others use a set of shallow neural networks to select an appropriate reaction. The novelty lies in the use of field programmable gate arrays embedded on the sensors that take into account internal system state, configuration, and learned state-action pairs, which guide device decisions to meet system demands. Experiments show that even relatively simple reward functions develop both Q-learning policies and shallow neural networks that yield positive device behaviors in dynamic environments.",

    "abstract": "As the number and capabilities of mobile devices is rapidly increasing, new challenges arise in the way services are currently designed. Users are seeking for more complex and advanced functionalities able to satisfy their increasing requirements. As a consequence, in ubiquitous environments, a different way to design services has to be introduced in order to guarantee services always up to date in a transparent and efficient way. In this paper, we present and analyze a framework for distributed cooperative service evolution in a wireless nomadic environment. In particular, we assume a disconnected network architecture, where users' mobility is exploited to achieve a scalable behavior, and communication is based on localized peer-to-peer interactions among neighboring nodes. Service management is achieved by introducing autonomic services, whose operations are based on a distributed evolution process, which draws tools and concepts from evolutionary computation (and genetic algorithms in particular). The latter relies on the concept of recombination , i.e., the exchange of information among service users, which collaborate to enhance their fitness , defined as the ability of the actual service to fulfill user's requirements. We introduce a general framework for analyzing service recombination policies and exploit results from martingales theory to study their convergence properties.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we provide convergence results for an Ant-based Routing Algorithm (ARA) for wireline, packet-switched communication networks, that are acyclic. Such algorithms are inspired by the foraging behavior of ants in nature. We consider an ARA algorithm proposed earlier by Bean and Costa [2005]. The algorithm has the virtues of being adaptive and distributed, and can provide a multipath routing solution. We consider a scenario where there are multiple incoming data traffic streams that are to be routed to their respective destinations via the network. Ant packets, which are nothing but probe packets, are introduced to estimate the path delays in the network. The node routing tables, which consist of routing probabilities for the outgoing links, are updated based on these delay estimates. In contrast to the available analytical studies in the literature, the link delays in our model are stochastic, time-varying, and dependent on the link traffic. The evolution of the delay estimates and the routing probabilities are described by a set of stochastic iterative equations. In doing so, we take into account the distributed and asynchronous nature of the algorithm operation. Using methods from the theory of stochastic approximations, we show that the evolution of the delay estimates can be closely tracked by a deterministic ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation) system, when the step size of the delay estimation scheme is small. We study the equilibrium behavior of the ODE system in order to obtain the equilibrium behavior of the routing algorithm. We also explore properties of the equilibrium routing probabilities, and provide illustrative simulation results.",

    "abstract": "We focus on the problem of adding multitolerance to an existing fault-intolerant program. A multitolerant program tolerates multiple classes of faults and provides a potentially different level of fault tolerance to each of them. We consider three levels of fault tolerance, namely failsafe (i.e., satisfy safety in the presence of faults), nonmasking (i.e., recover to legitimate states after the occurrence of faults), and masking (both). For the case where the program is subject to two classes of faults, we consider six categories of multitolerant programs—FF, FN, FM, MM, MN, and NN, where F, N, and M represent failsafe, nonmasking, and masking levels of tolerance provided to each class of fault. We show that the problem of adding FF, NN, and MN multitolerance can be solved in polynomial time (in the state space of the program). However, the problem is NP-complete for adding FN, MM, and FM multitolerance. We note that the hardness of adding MM and FM multitolerance is especially atypical given that MM and FM multitolerance can be added efficiently under more restricted scenarios where multiple faults occur simultaneously in the same computation. We also present heuristics for managing the complexity of MM multitolerance. Finally, we present real-world multitolerant programs and discuss the trade-off involved in design decisions while developing such programs.",

Imitation-based learning involves learning from an expert by observing the demonstration of a task and then replicating it. This mechanism makes it convenient for a knowledge engineer to transfer knowledge to a software agent. This article applies imitation to learn not only the strategy of an individual agent, but also the collaborative strategy of a team of agents to achieve a common goal. The article presents an imitation-based solution that learns a weighted naïve Bayes structure, whereas the weights of the model are optimized using Artificial Immune Systems. The learned model is then used by agents to act autonomously. The applicability of the presented approach is assessed in the RoboCup Soccer 3D Simulation environment, which is a promising platform to address many complex real-world problems. The performance of the trained agents is benchmarked against other RoboCup Soccer 3D Simulation teams. In addition to performance characteristics, the research also analyzes the behavioral traits of the imitating team to assess how closely they are imitating the demonstrating team.",

We focus on the specific case in which network changes and failures occur in batches with a minimum frequency in the order of the diameter of the network. Our contribution consists in two self-stabilizing mechanisms, allowing fast gossiping algorithms to be applicable to dynamic networks with minor increase in resources usage. The resulting algorithms can be deployed in networks exhibiting churn, node stop-failures and resets, and random topological changes. The theoretical results are verified with simulations on synthetic data, showcasing desirable properties for large-scale network designers such as scalability, lack of single points of failure, and anonymity.",

    "abstract": "Todays' networks are becoming increasingly complex. They must provide a growing variety of services to a wide range of devices. In order to do so, they must make efficient use of modern technologies including MIMO, macrodiversity, power control, channel allocation, beamforming, and so on. In this context, the centralized management of radio resources on a large scale is rapidly becoming intractable. Distributed intelligence constitutes an increasingly attractive solution to provide network-wide self-configuration and adaptation capabilities. This article presents the design of a swarming system for autonomous power control which adapts naturally to the changing conditions of mobile networks where interference patterns are in constant flux. Empirical methods proposed by Parunak [1997] to develop MultiAgent Systems with Swarming (MASS) are applied to the current context while emphasizing the key concepts that lead to swarming (emergent behavior). A simulation-based study reveals how the system can be fine-tuned to obtain various solutions, balancing resources differently to achieve different trade-off points. Finally, it is shown that the distributed approach based on swarming is not only feasible but leads to higher global QoS levels than comparable centralized approaches.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of dynamically migrating a service in the cloud to satisfy an online sequence of mobile batch-request demands in a cost-effective way. The service may have single or multiple replicas, each running on a virtual machine. As the origin of mobile accesses frequently changes over time, this problem is particularly important for time-bounded services to achieve enhanced Quality of Service and cost effectiveness. Moving the service closer to the client locations not only reduces the service access latency but also minimizes the network costs for service providers. However, these benefits are not free. The migration comes at a cost of bulk-data transfer and service disruption, and hence, increasing the overall service costs. To gain the benefits of service migration while minimizing the caused monetary costs, we propose an efficient search-based algorithm Dmig to migrate a single server, and then extend it as a scalable algorithm, called mDmig , to the multi-server situation, a more general case in the cloud. Both algorithms are fully distributed, symmetric, and characterized by the effective use of historical access information to conduct virtual migration so that the limitations of local search in the cost reduction can be overcome. To evaluate the algorithms, we compared them with some existing algorithms and an off-line algorithm. Our simulation results showed that the proposed algorithms exhibit better performance in service migration by adapting to the changes of mobile access patterns in a cost-effective way.",

    "abstract": "In disasters, many stationary tasks, such as saving survivors in debris, extinguishing fire of buildings, and so on, need first responders to complete on site. In such circumstances, wireless mobile robots are usually employed to search for tasks and establish ad hoc networks to assist first responders. Due to the unknown and complexity of environments and limited capabilities of wireless mobile robots, searching and establishing ad hoc networks in disaster environments is a challenging issue in both theory and practice. To this end, a task-based wireless mobile robot deployment approach is proposed in this article. The proposed approach consists of a search process and a deployment process. The search process can guide wireless mobile robots to efficiently find tasks in unknown and complex environments. The deployment process can find suitable deployment locations for wireless mobile robots to establish ad hoc networks. The established ad hoc networks can ensure the communication of wireless mobile robots in the network and can cover the maximum number of task locations and the maximum areas in a disaster environment. Experimental results demonstrate that based on the proposed approach, wireless mobile robots have better performance in terms of search and ad hoc network establishment in disaster environments.",

    "abstract": "Autonomy and adaptability are essential components of ambient intelligence. For example, in smart homes, proactive acting and occupants advising, adapted to current and future contexts of living, are essential to go beyond limitations of previous domotic services. To reach such autonomy and adaptability, ambient systems need to automatically grasp their users’ ambient context. In particular, users’ activities and availabilities for communication are valuable pieces of contextual information that can help such systems to adapt to user needs and behaviours. While significant research work exists on activity recognition in homes, less attention has been given to prediction of future activities, as well as to availability recognition and prediction in general. In this article, we investigate several Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) architectures for activity and availability prediction of occupants in homes, including our novel model, called Past SItuations to predict the NExt Situation (PSINES). This predictive architecture utilizes context information, sensor event aggregations, and latent user cognitive states to accurately predict future home situations based on previous situations. We experimentally evaluate PSINES, as well as intermediate DBN architectures, on multiple state-of-the-art datasets, with prediction accuracies of up to 89.52% for activity and 82.08% for availability on the Orange4Home dataset.",

    "abstract": "Advancements in CMOS technology enable the integration of a huge number of resources on the same system-on-chip. Managing the consequent growing complexity, including fault tolerance issues in deep submicron technologies, is a hard challenge for hardware designers. Self-organization may represent a viable path toward the development of massively parallel architectures in current and future technologies. This approach is progressively more studied in multiprocessor architectures where, however, a further mind-set shift in terms of programming paradigm is required. In this article, self-organization and self-adaptiveness are exploited for the design of a coprocessing unit for array computations, supporting floating-point arithmetic. From the experience of previous explorations, an architecture embodying some principle of swarm intelligence to pursue adaptability, scalability, and fault tolerance is proposed. The architecture realizes a loosely structured collection of hardware agents implementing fixed behavioral rules aimed at the best exploitation of the available resources in whatever kind of context without any hardware reconfiguration. Comparisons with off-the-shelf very long instruction word (VLIW) digital signal processors (DSPs) on specific tasks reveal similar performance thus not paying the improved robustness with performance. The multitasking capabilities, together with the intrinsic scalability, make this approach valuable for future extensions as well, especially in the field of neuronal networks simulators.",

To relieve ISP owned fixed-line networks from CDN streamed multimedia traffic, system ideas (e.g., Wi-Stitch in [ 45 ]) have been proposed to (a) leverage 5G services and enable consumers to share cached multimedia content at the edge, and (b) consequently, and more importantly, reduce IP traffic at the core network. Unfortunately, given that contemporary multimedia content might be a monetized asset, these ideas do not take this important fact into account for shared content. We present EdgeMart —a content provider (CP) federated, and computationally sustainable networked (graphical) market economy for paid-sharing of cached licensed (OTT) content with autonomous users of a wireless edge network (WEN). EdgeMart is a unique oligopoly multimedia market (economy) that comprises competing networked sub-markets of non-cooperative content sellers/buyers—each sub-market consisting of a single buyer connected (networked) to only a subset of sellers. We prove that for any WEN-supported supply-demand topology , a pure strategy EdgeMart equilibrium exists that is (a) nearly efficient (in a microeconomic sense) indicating economy sustainability, (b) robust to edge user entry/exit, and (c) can be reached in poly-time (indicating computational sustainability). In addition, we experimentally show that for physical WENs of varying densities, a rationally selfish EdgeMart economy induces similar orders of multimedia IP traffic savings when compared to the ideal (relatively less practical), altruistic , and non-monetized “economy” implemented atop the recently introduced Wi-Stitch WEN-based content trading architecture. Moreover, the EdgeMart concept helps envision a regulated edge economy of opportunistic (pay per licensed file) client services for commercial OTT platforms.",

Causal knowledge on relations between system entities is essential for enabling system self-adaption to dynamic changes. As house configurations are diverse, this knowledge is difficult to obtain. In previous work, we proposed to generate Causal Bayesian Networks (CBN) as follows. Starting with considering all possible relations, we progressively discarded non-correlated variables. Next, we identified causal relations from the remaining correlations by employing “ do-operations .” The obtained CBN could then be employed for causal inference. The main challenges of this approach included “non-doable variables” and limited scalability. To address these issues, we propose three extensions: (i) early pruning weakly correlated relations to reduce the number of required do-operations, (ii) introducing aggregate variables that summarize relations between weakly coupled sub-systems, and (iii) applying the method a second time to perform indirect do interventions and handle non-doable relations. We illustrate and evaluate the efficiency of these contributions via examples from the smart home and power grid domain. Our proposal leads to a decrease in the number of operations required to learn the CBN and in an increased accuracy of the learned CBN, paving the way toward applications in large CPS.",

    "abstract": "P2P technology has recently been adopted by Internet-based malware as a fault tolerant and scalable communication medium. Due to its decentralized and self-organizing nature, P2P malware is harder to detect and block, especially if it utilizes specialized techniques for hiding. We analyze a number of hiding strategies through extensive and realistic simulations over a model of the AS-level Internet topology. We show that the most effective strategy to avoid detection is to drastically reduce the maximal number of peers a node communicates with. While overlay networks of a small constant maximal degree are generally considered to be unscalable, we argue that it is possible to design them to be scalable, efficient, and robust. An important implication is that stealth mode P2P malware that is very difficult to discover with state-of-the-art methods is a plausible threat. We discuss algorithms and theoretical results that support the scalability of stealth mode overlays, and we present realistic event-based simulations of a proof-of-concept system. Besides the context of P2P malware, some of our results are of general interest in the area of constant degree overlays in connection with the problem of how to maintain reasonable performance and reliability with the smallest degree possible.",

The mechanisms used for this purpose, termed isolation points, are software abstractions inserted at key program locations: (1) in application interfaces, (2) in middleware implementations for making remote requests, and (3) in the system interfaces used by middleware and applications. This article demonstrates the utility of isolation points by using them to implement higher level abstractions that improve the performance-robustness of representative enterprise applications. The I-Queue abstraction uses isolation points to implement performance-robust messaging, targeting the message queues used in distributed enterprise codes. By appropriately orchestrating message dispatching, I-Queue can achieve an improvement of 16--32% in dispatched message locality based on traces obtained from the large-scale e-Pricing® search engine operated by Worldspan L.P.",

    "abstract": "A long-standing goal in artificial intelligence and robotics is synthesising agents that can effectively learn and adapt throughout their lifetime. One open-ended approach to behaviour learning in autonomous robots is online evolution , which is part of the evolutionary robotics field of research. In online evolution approaches, an evolutionary algorithm is executed on the robots during task execution, which enables continuous optimisation and adaptation of behaviour. Despite the potential for automatic behaviour learning, online evolution has not been widely adopted because it often requires several hours or days to synthesise solutions to a given task. In this respect, research in the field has failed to develop a prevalent algorithm able to effectively synthesise solutions to a large number of different tasks in a timely manner. Rather than focusing on a single algorithm, we argue for more general mechanisms that can combine the benefits of different algorithms to increase the performance of online evolution of robot controllers. We conduct a comprehensive assessment of a novel approach called online hyper-evolution (OHE). Robots executing OHE use the different sources of feedback information traditionally associated with controller evaluation to find effective evolutionary algorithms during task execution. First, we study two approaches: OHE-fitness, which uses the fitness score of controllers as the criterion to select promising algorithms over time, and OHE-diversity, which relies on the behavioural diversity of controllers for algorithm selection. We then propose a novel class of techniques called OHE-hybrid, which combine diversity and fitness to search for suitable algorithms. In addition to their effectiveness at selecting suitable algorithms, the different OHE approaches are evaluated for their ability to construct algorithms by controlling which algorithmic components should be employed for controller generation (e.g., mutation, crossover, among others), an unprecedented approach in evolutionary robotics. Results show that OHE (i) facilitates the evolution of controllers with high performance, (ii) can increase effectiveness at different stages of evolution by combining the benefits of multiple algorithms over time, and (iii) can be effectively applied to construct new algorithms during task execution. Overall, our study shows that OHE is a powerful new paradigm that allows robots to improve their learning process as they operate in the task environment.",

    "abstract": "Self-organization has the potential for high scalability, adaptability, flexibility, and robustness, which are vital features for realizing future networks. The convergence of self-organizing control, however, is slow in some practical applications in comparison with control by conventional deterministic systems using global information. It is therefore important to facilitate the convergence of self-organizing controls. In controlled self-organization , which introduces an external controller into self-organizing systems, the network is controlled to guide systems to a desired state. Although existing controlled self-organization schemes could achieve the same state, it is difficult for an external controller to collect information about the network and to provide control inputs to the network, especially when the network size is large. This is because the computational cost for designing the external controller and for calculating the control inputs increases rapidly as the number of nodes in the network becomes large. Therefore, we partition a network into several sub-networks and introduce two types of controllers, a central controller and several sub-controllers that control the network in a hierarchical manner. In this study, we propose a hierarchical optimal feedback mechanism for self-organizing systems and apply this mechanism to potential-based self-organizing routing. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism improves the convergence speed of potential-field construction (i.e., route construction) up to 10.6-fold with low computational and communication costs.",

    "abstract": "A goal of peer-to-peer applications is to share files between users themselves rather than downloading files from file servers. Self-downloading protocols have the property that, eventually, every user downloads only from other users. Self-downloading is problematic if users disconnect from the system upon completing file downloading, because they only share with other users while connected. Yet, if users continue to arrive at a sufficient rate, self-downloading protocols are possible. One vulnerability of file sharing between users is the possibility that files or segments could be counterfeit or corrupt. Protocols that are d -safe tolerate some number of instances of faulty segments in a file being downloaded, because each segment is downloaded d times before being shared. This article shows that d -safe self-downloading is possible for a sufficiently large arrival rate of users to the system. Upper and lower connectivity and sharing bounds are given for d = 2, and simulation results show effects of relaxing assumptions about arrival rates and bandwidth.",

    "abstract": "Many problems in science and engineering are usually emulated as a set of mutually interacting models, resulting in a coupled or multiphysics application. These component models show challenges originating from their interdisciplinary nature and from their computational and algorithmic complexities. In general, these models are independently developed and maintained, so that they commonly employ the global file system for exchanging their data in the coupled application. To effectively use the local file cache on the compute node for exchanging the data among the processes of such applications, and consequently boosting I/O performance, this article presents a novel mechanism to migrate a process from one compute node to another node on the basis of block I/O dependency. In this newly proposed mechanism, the block I/O dependency between two involved processes running on the different nodes is profiled as block access similarity by taking advantage of the Cohen’s kappa statistic . Then, the process is supposed to be dynamically migrated from its source node to the destination node, on which there is another process having heavy block I/O dependency. As a result, both processes can exchange their data by utilizing the local file cache instead of the global file system to reduce I/O time. The experimental results demonstrate that the I/O performance can be significantly improved, and the time required for executing the application can be resultantly decreased, as expected.",

    "abstract": "A major concern for today’s smartphones is their much faster battery drain than traditional feature phones, despite their greater battery capacities. The difference is mainly contributed by those more powerful but also much more power-consuming smartphone components, such as the multi-core application processor and the high-definition (HD) display. While the application processor must be active when any smart apps are being used, it is also unnecessarily waken up, even during idle periods, to perform operations related to basic phone functions (i.e., incoming calls and text messages). In addition, the power-hungry HD display is also used unnecessarily for such basic functions. In this article, we investigate how to increase the battery life of smartphones by minimizing the use of application processor and HD display for operations related to basic functions. We find that the application processor is often waken up by a process running on it, called the Radio Interface Layer Daemon (RILD), which interfaces the user and apps to the GSM/LTE cellular network. In particular, we demonstrate that a great amount of energy could be saved if RILD is stopped, such that the application processor can sleep more often. Based on this key finding, we design a Smart On Demand (SOD) configuration that reduces the smartphone energy consumption by running RILD operations on a secondary low-power microcontroller and by using a secondary low-power display to interface the user with basic functions. As a result, basic phone functions can be handled at much lower energy costs and the power-consuming components, i.e., application processor and HD display, are waken up only when one needs to use any smart apps, in an on-demand manner. We have built a hardware prototype of SOD and evaluated it with real user traces. Our results show that SOD can increase its battery life by up to 2.5 more days.",

    "abstract": "Various methods have been proposed in the literature for identifying subgoals in discrete reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. Once subgoals are discovered, task decomposition methods can be employed to improve the learning performance of agents. In this study, we classify prominent subgoal identification methods for discrete RL tasks in the literature into the following three categories: graph-based, statistics-based, and multi-instance learning (MIL)-based. As contributions, first, we introduce a new MIL-based subgoal identification algorithm called EMDD-RL and experimentally compare it with a previous MIL-based method. The previous approach adapts MIL’s Diverse Density (DD) algorithm, whereas our method considers Expected-Maximization Diverse Density (EMDD). The advantage of EMDD over DD is that it can yield more accurate results with less computation demand thanks to the expectation-maximization algorithm. EMDD-RL modifies some of the algorithmic steps of EMDD to identify subgoals in discrete RL problems. Second, we evaluate the methods in several RL tasks for the hyperparameter tuning overhead they incur. Third, we propose a new RL problem called key-room and compare the methods for their subgoal identification performances in this new task. Experiment results show that MIL-based subgoal identification methods could be preferred to the algorithms of the other two categories in practice.",

    "abstract": "Digitalization enables the automation required to operate modern cyber-physical energy systems (CPESs), leading to a shift from hierarchical to organic systems. However, digitalization increases the number of factors affecting the state of a CPES (e.g., software bugs and cyber threats). In addition to established factors like functional correctness, others like security become relevant but are yet to be integrated into an operational viewpoint, i.e. a holistic perspective on the system state. Trust in organic computing is an approach to gain a holistic view of the state of systems. It consists of several facets (e.g., functional correctness, security, and reliability), which can be used to assess the state of CPES. Therefore, a trust assessment on all levels can contribute to a coherent state assessment. This paper focuses on the trust in ICT-enabled grid services in a CPES. These are essential for operating the CPES, and their performance relies on various data aspects like availability, timeliness, and correctness. This paper proposes to assess the trust in involved components and data to estimate data correctness, which is crucial for grid services. The assessment is presented considering two exemplary grid services, namely state estimation and coordinated voltage control. Furthermore, the interpretation of different trust facets is also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Power capping is an important technique for high-density servers to safely oversubscribe the power infrastructure in a data center. However, power capping is commonly accomplished by dynamically lowering the server processors’ frequency levels, which can result in degraded application performance. For servers that run important machine learning (ML) applications with Service-Level Objective (SLO) requirements, inference performance such as recognition accuracy must be optimized within a certain latency constraint, which demands high server performance. In order to achieve the best inference accuracy under the desired latency and server power constraints, this paper proposes OptimML, a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) control framework that jointly controls both inference latency and server power consumption, by flexibly adjusting the machine learning model size (and so its required computing resources) when server frequency needs to be lowered for power capping. Our results on a hardware testbed with widely adopted ML framework (including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MXNet) show that OptimML achieves higher inference accuracy compared with several well-designed baselines, while respecting both latency and power constraints. Furthermore, an adaptive control scheme with online model switching and estimation is designed to achieve analytic assurance of control accuracy and system stability, even in the face of significant workload/hardware variations.",

    "abstract": "We present novel techniques for simultaneous task allocation and planning in multi-robot systems operating under uncertainty. By performing task allocation and planning simultaneously, allocations are informed by individual robot behaviour, creating more efficient team behaviour. We go beyond existing work by planning for task reallocation across the team given a model of partial task satisfaction under potential robot failures and uncertain action outcomes. We model the problem using Markov decision processes, with tasks encoded in co-safe linear temporal logic, and optimise for the expected number of tasks completed by the team. To avoid the inherent complexity of joint models, we propose an alternative model that simultaneously considers task allocation and planning, but in a sequential fashion. We then build a joint policy from the sequential policy obtained from our model, thus allowing for concurrent policy execution. Furthermore, to enable adaptation in the case of robot failures, we consider replanning from failure states and propose an approach to preemptively replan in an anytime fashion, replanning for more probable failure states first. Our method also allows us to quantify the performance of the team by providing an analysis of properties, such as the expected number of completed tasks under concurrent policy execution. We implement and extensively evaluate our approach on a range of scenarios. We compare its performance to a state-of-the-art baseline in decoupled task allocation and planning: sequential single-item auctions. Our approach outperforms the baseline in terms of computation time and the number of times replanning is required on robot failure.",

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of backdoor attacks has emerged as a significant threat to the security of autonomous driving models. An attacker injects a backdoor into the model by adding triggers to the samples, which can be activated to manipulate the model’s inference. Backdoor attacks can lead to severe consequences, such as misidentifying traffic signs during autonomous driving, posing a risk of causing traffic accidents. Recently, there has been a gradual evolution of frequency-domain backdoor attacks. However, since the change of both amplitude and its corresponding phase will significantly affect image appearance, most of the existing frequency-domain backdoor attacks change only the amplitude, which results in a suboptimal efficacy of the attack. In this work, we propose an attack called IBAQ, to solve this problem by blurring semantic information of the trigger image through the quadratic phase. Initially, we convert the trigger and benign sample to YCrCb space. Then, we perform the fast Fourier transform on the Y channel, blending the trigger image’s amplitude and quadratic phase linearly with the benign sample’s amplitude and phase. IBAQ achieves covert injection of trigger information within amplitude and phase, enhancing the attack effect. We validate the effectiveness and stealthiness of IBAQ through comprehensive experiments.",

    "abstract": "The microservices architecture simplifies application development by breaking monolithic applications into manageable microservices. However, this distributed microservice “service mesh” leads to new challenges due to the more complex application topology. Particularly, each service component scales up and down independently creating load imbalance problems on shared backend services accessed by multiple components. Traditional load balancing algorithms do not port over well to a distributed microservice architecture where load balancers are deployed client-side. In this article, we propose a self-managing load balancing system, BLOC, which provides consistent response times to users without using a centralized metadata store or explicit messaging between nodes. BLOC uses overload control approaches to provide feedback to the load balancers. We show that this performs significantly better in solving the incast problem in microservice architectures. A critical component of BLOC is the dynamic capacity estimation algorithm. We show that a well-tuned capacity estimate can outperform even join-the-shortest-queue, a nearly optimal algorithm, while a reasonable dynamic estimate still outperforms Least Connection, a distributed implementation of join-the-shortest-queue. Evaluating this framework, we found that BLOC improves the response time distribution range, between the 10th and 90th percentiles, by 2 –4 times and the tail, 99th percentile, latency by 2 times.",

Second, it has the ability of tampered model detection based on interpretable analysis, which can effectively ensure that the model is not tampered with. Third, it has a reward mechanism based on work contribution and trust assessment, which uses blockchain technology to ensure the continuous security operation of this architecture. To verify the performance of FASDSA, we used the UNSW-NB15 dataset to conduct three experiments. The experimental results indicate that compared to traditional methods, FASDSA possesses greater flexibility and security while maintaining similar or even superior model performance.",

    "abstract": "This work envisions industrial control systems that can reliably adapt to requirements. We rely on the international standard IEC 61499 to achieve this goal. The standard allows downtimeless system evolution such that an application can be modified at runtime to satisfy the requirements. However, an IEC 61499 application consisting of multiple Function Blocks (FBs) can be modified in many different ways, such as inserting or deleting FBs, creating new FBs with their respective internal behaviours and adjusting the connections between FBs. These changes require considerable effort and cost, and there is no guarantee to satisfy the requirements. This article applies runtime enforcement techniques for supporting adaptive IEC 61499 applications. This set of techniques can modify the runtime behaviour of a system according to specific requirements. Our approach begins with specifying the requirements as a state machine-based notation called contract automaton. This automaton is then used to synthesise an enforcer as an FB. Finally, the new FB is integrated into the application to execute according to the requirements. A tool support is developed to automate the approach. Experiments were performed to evaluate the performance of enforcers by measuring the execution time of several applications before and after the integration of enforcers.",

    "abstract": "The race towards performance increase and computing power has led to chips with heterogeneous and complex designs, integrating an ever-growing number of cores on the same monolithic chip or chiplet silicon die. Higher integration density, compounded with the slowdown of technology-driven power reduction, implies that power and thermal management become increasingly relevant. Unfortunately, existing research lacks a detailed analysis and modeling of thermal, power, and electrical coupling effects and how they have to be jointly considered to perform dynamic control of complex and heterogeneous mpsoc. To close the gap, in this work, we first provide a detailed thermal and power model targeting a modern hpc mpsoc. We consider real-world coupling effects such as actuators’ non-idealities and the exponential relation between the dissipated power, the temperature state, and the voltage level in a single processing element. We analyze how these factors affect the control algorithm behavior and the type of challenges that they pose. Based on the analysis, we propose a thermal capping strategy inspired by Fuzzy control theory to replace the state-of-the-art PID controller, as well as a root-finding iterative method to optimally choose the shared voltage value among cores grouped in the same voltage domain. We evaluate the proposed controller with model-in-the-loop and hardware-in-the-loop co-simulations. We show an improvement over state-of-the-art methods of up to \\(5\\times\\) the maximum exceeded temperature while providing an average of \\(3.56\\%\\) faster application execution runtime across all the evaluation scenarios.",

Massive edge-computing end nodes are eager for adequate multimedia data to satisfy the requirements of real-time video services. However, existing encoding standards for video services in Web 2.0 are specifically designed for something other than IoT video streaming. We have improved our Adaptive Compression-Reconstruction framework ACORN to obtain ACORN+, based on compressed sensing and recent advances in deep learning. At end nodes, we compress multiple sequential video frames into a single frame to reduce video volume. Given that multiple kinds of intelligent tasks are expected to be finished on the device side, we also designed a device-cloud collaboration scheme where deep learning-based algorithms can be executed on both the device and server sides. Experiments reveal that video analytics can be conducted on compressed frames. Taking action recognition as a device-cloud collaboration use case, we find ACORN+ obtains more than 3x speedup on compressed frames. The reconstruction algorithm in ACORN+ is with 1- 4 dB improvements. Moreover, the encoding time cost and the encoded video volume are reduced by more than 4x under the ACORN+ framework. 1",

    "abstract": "Monocular 3D object detection is essential for identifying objects in road images, thus offering valuable environmental perception data that are crucial for human-centric autonomous driving systems. However, due to the inherent limitations of camera imaging, obtaining precise depth information from images alone is challenging, which hampers the accuracy of within-scene object localization. In this paper, we introduce a monocular 3D object detection method called MonoFG that uses knowledge distillation with separated foreground and background components to improve the accuracy of object localization. First, detached foreground and background distillation processes can strategically leverage the distinct positional information acquired from each location to optimize the produced global distillation effects. This step serves as the foundation for the subsequent feature and response distillation process, which focuses on the distilled foreground and background rather than isolated object distillation. Second, triple attention mechanism-based feature distillation intensifies the feature imitation and feature representation capabilities of the student network. Spatial and channel attention mechanisms encourage the student network to capture crucial pixels and channels from the teacher network, whereas a self-attention mechanism globally transfers the learned relationships between pixels. Third, localization error-based response distillation facilitates a clearer transfer of positional information from the teacher network to the student network. Only when the positioning ability of the teacher network exceeds that of the student network can knowledge be comprehensively distilled across both the foreground and background. Therefore, the distillation process is constrained to specific content, which is delineated by positioning errors that serve as the boundaries. Finally, experiments conducted on the KITTI benchmark dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms many well-known baseline methods in several representative evaluation tasks (e.g., 3D object detection and bird's-eye view (BEV) detection) involving human-centric autonomous driving systems.",

    "abstract": "Small uncrewed aerial systems, sUAS, provide an invaluable resource for performing a variety of surveillance, search, and delivery tasks in remote or hostile terrains which may not be accessible by other means. Due to the critical role sUAS play in these situations, it is vital that they are well configured in order to ensure a safe and stable flight. However, it is not uncommon for mistakes to occur in configuration and calibration, leading to failures or incomplete missions. To address this problem, we propose a set of self-adaptive mechanisms and implement them into a self-adaptive framework, CICADA , for Controller Instability-preventing Configuration Aware Drone Adaptation. CICADA dynamically detects unstable drone behavior during flight and adapts to mitigate this threat. We have built a prototype of CICADA using a popular open source sUAS flight control software and experimented with a large number of different configurations in simulation. We then performed a case study with physical drones to determine if our framework will work in practice. Experimental results show that CICADA’s adaptations reduce controller instability and enable the sUAS to recover from up to 33.8% of poor configurations. In cases where we cannot complete the intended mission, invoking alternative adaptations may still help by allowing the vehicle to loiter or land safely in place, avoiding potentially catastrophic crashes. These safety-focused adaptations can mitigate unsafe behavior in 52.9% to 64.7% of dangerous configurations. We further show that rule-based approaches can be leveraged to automatically select an appropriate adaptation strategy based on the severity of instability encountered, with up to a 14.2% improvement over direct adaptation. Finally, we introduce a variation of our primary adaptation strategy designed to allow more cautious adaptation with limited configuration information, which gets within 6.7% of our primary adaptation strategy despite not requiring an optimal knowledge base.",

To address this gap, we introduce a novel contextual goal model to capture these factors and their influence on the system. Using this, we propose a two-layer control mechanism with a context-aware model predictive control to achieve proactive adaptation for the software system and adaptation for the controller itself. By contextual prediction and a more accurate system model, our approach utilizes model predictive control to facilitate timely and efficient system adaptations, improving both performance and adaptability. Meanwhile, we perform requirement adaptation to update the contextual goal model, which in turn updates the objective function and constraints of the controller. Our experimental evaluations across two scenarios demonstrate the significant benefits of our approach in enhancing system performance.",

Behavioural plasticity enables humans and animals alike to respond to environmental changes without degrading learned knowledge; this can be achieved by regulating behaviour with neuromodulation—a biological process found in the brain. We demonstrate that by modulating activity-propagating signals, neurally trained agents evolving to solve tasks in dynamic environments that are prone to change can expect a significantly higher fitness than non-modulatory agents and also achieve their goals more often. Further, we show that while behavioural plasticity can help agents to achieve goals in these variable environments, this ability to overcome environmental changes with greater success comes at the cost of highly volatile evolution.",

    "abstract": "BitTorrent (BT) is one of the most common Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file sharing protocols. Rather than downloading a file from a single source, the protocol allows users to join a swarm of peers to download and upload from each other simultaneously. Worms exploiting information from BT servers or trackers can cause serious damage to participating peers, which unfortunately has been neglected previously. In this article, we first present a new worm, called Adaptive BitTorrent worm (A-BT worm), which finds new victims and propagates sending forged requests to trackers. To reduce its abnormal behavior, the worm estimates the ratio of infected peers and adaptively adjusts its propagation speed. We then build a hybrid model to precisely characterize the propagation behavior of the worm. We also propose a statistical method to automatically detect the worm from the tracker by estimating the variance of the time intervals of requests. To slow down the worm propagation, we design a safe strategy in which the tracker returns secured peers when receives a request. Finally, we evaluate the accuracy of the hybrid model, and the effectiveness of our detection method and containment strategy through simulations.",

The weak coupling between information producers and consumers in P/S systems is attractive for loosely coupled and dynamic network infrastructures such as ad hoc networks. However, achieving end-to-end timeliness and reliability properties when P/S events are causally dependent is an open problem in ad hoc networks. In this article, we present, evaluate benefits of, and compare with past work an architecture design that can effectively support timely and reliable delivery of events and causally related events in ad hoc environments, and especially in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). With observations from both realistic application model and simulation experiments, we reveal causal dependencies among events and their significance in a typical use notional system. We also examine and propose engineering methodologies to further tailor an event-based system to facilitate its self-reorganizing capability and self-reconfiguration. Our design features a two-layer structure, including novel distributed algorithms and mechanisms for P/S tree construction and maintenance. The trace-based experimental simulation studies illustrate our design's effectiveness in both cases with and without causal dependencies.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the Read-Write-Coding-System (RWC), a very flexible class of linear block codes that generate efficient and flexible erasure codes for storage networks. In particular, given a message x of k symbols and a codeword y of n symbols, an RW code defines additional parameters k≤ r,w≤ n that offer enhanced possibilities to adjust the fault-tolerance capability of the code. More precisely, an RWC provides linear (n,r,d) -codes that have: (a) minimum (Hamming) distance d = n-r+1 for any two codewords, and (b) for any codeword y 1 there exists a codeword y 2 with distance of at most w . Furthermore, depending on the values r,w and the code alphabet, different block codes such as parity codes (e.g., RAID 4/5) or Reed-Solomon (RS) codes (if r = k and thus, w = n ) can be generated. In storage networks in which I/O accesses are very costly and redundancy is crucial, this flexibility has considerable advantages as r and w can optimally be adapted to read or write intensive applications; only w symbols must be updated if the message x changes completely, which is different from other codes that always need to rewrite y completely as x changes. In this article, we first state a tight lower bound and basic conditions for all RW codes. Furthermore, we introduce special RW codes in which all mentioned parameters are adjustable even online, that is, RW codes which are adaptive to changing demands. At last, we investigate the question for which choices of (k,r,w,n) a coding system exists over the binary alphabet F 2 = {0,1} and discuss how RW codes can be combined.",

We first present a practical scheme for anonymous transactions while the transaction resolution is assisted by a Trusted Authority. This practical scheme is extended to a theoretical scheme where a Trusted Authority is not involved in the transaction resolution. Both schemes assume that all the players interact over anonymous secure channels. Given authority that generates for each player hard to produce evidence EVID (e.g., problem instance with or without a solution) to each player, the identity of a user U is defined by the ability to prove possession of aforementioned evidence. We use zero-knowledge proof techniques to repeatedly identify U by providing a proof that U has evidence EVID , without revealing EVID , therefore avoiding identity theft. In both schemes the authority provides each user with a unique random string. A player U may produce a unique user name and password for each other player S using a one-way function over the random string and the IP address of S . The player does not have to maintain any information in order to reproduce the user name and password used for accessing a player S . Moreover, the player U may execute transactions with a group of players S U in two phases; in the first phase the player interacts with each server without revealing information concerning its identity and without possibly identifying linkability among the servers in S U . In the second phase the player allows linkability and therefore transaction commitment with all servers in S U , while preserving anonymity (for future transactions).",

    "abstract": "Online applications that serve global workload have become a norm and those applications are experiencing not only temporal but also spatial workload variations. In addition, more applications are hosting their backend tiers separately for benefits such as ease of management. To provision for such applications, traditional elasticity approaches that only consider temporal workload dynamics and assume well-provisioned backends are insufficient. Instead, in this article, we propose a new type of provisioning mechanisms—geo-elasticity, by utilizing distributed clouds with different locations. Centered on this idea, we build a system called DBScale that tracks geographic variations in the workload to dynamically provision database replicas at different cloud locations across the globe. Our geo-elastic provisioning approach comprises a regression-based model that infers database query workload from spatially distributed front-end workload, a two-node open queueing network model that estimates the capacity of databases serving both CPU and I/O-intensive query workloads and greedy algorithms for selecting best cloud locations based on latency and cost. We implement a prototype of our DBScale system on Amazon EC2’s distributed cloud. Our experiments with our prototype show up to a 66% improvement in response time when compared to local elasticity approaches.",

Extensive quality control and calibration measurements result in a precision of 0.l% for a single nightly observation and 0.0270 for yearly means, far better than previously thought possible with ground-based observations. We are able, for the first time, to trace brightness changes in Sun-like stars that are of similar amplitude to brightness changes in the Sun, whose changes can be observed only with space-based radiometers. Recently exciting discoveries of the first extrasolar planets have been announced, based on the detection of very small radial-velocity variations that imply the existence of planets in orbit around several Sun-like stars. Our precise brightness measurements have been crucial for the confirmation of these discoveries by helping to eliminate alternative explanations for the radial-velocity variations. With our automatic telescopes, we are also searching for transits of these planets across the disks of their stars in order to conclusively verify their existence. The detection of transits would provide the first direct measurements of the sizes, masses, and densities of these planets and, hence, information on their compositions and origins.",

    "abstract": "The concept of conventions has attracted much attention in the multi-agent system research. In this article, we study the emergence of conventions from repeated n -player coordination games. Distributed agents learn their policies independently and are capable of observing their neighbours in a network topology. We distinguish two types of information representation about the observations: gist trace and verbatim trace. We conjecture that learning based on the gist trace, which overlooks the details and focuses only on the general choice of action of a neighbourhood, should achieve efficient convention emergence. To this end, a novel learning method that makes use of the gist trace is proposed. The experimental results confirm that the proposed method establishes conventions much faster than the state-of-the-art learning methods across diverse settings of multi-agent systems. In particular, the use of gist trace derived at a low level of abstraction further improves the efficiency of convention emergence.",
