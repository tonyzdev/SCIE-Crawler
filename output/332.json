Efficacy of the biocontrol agent can potentially be affected by parasitoids. Three species of braconid parasitoid wasps were reared from puparia of Hydrellia egeriae . By comparison with the type specimens, these species have been determined to be Ademon lagarosiphonae van Achterberg, 2012 (Braconidae: Opiinae), Chaenusa anervata van Achterberg, 2012 and Chaenusa seminervata van Achterberg, 2012 (Braconidae: Alysiinae: Dacnusini), all previously recorded as parasitoids of an ephydrid dipterous aquatic leaf-miner, Hydrellia lagarosiphon Deeming, 2012, on Lagarosiphon major (Ridley, 1886) Moss ex Wager (Hydrocharitaceae) in South Africa. The chalcidoid, Janicharis africanus Gumovsky &amp;amp; Delvare, 2006 (Eulophidae), was also reared from Hydrellia egeriae and is possibly a hyperparasitoid of the braconids.

Numerous “old” amber localities mentioned at the beginning of the 20 th century or studied during the 1970s are no longer accessible, but recent field investigations have led to the discovery of new deposits. Among these, the Late Albian amber from Charente-Maritime (SW France) is particularly rich in biological inclusions and thus constitutes one of the major fossiliferous amber deposits for the Cretaceous period. Without having all groups studied, the authors made significant new records and identified taxa occuring in this French amber.

Attention is drawn to the unsatisfactory nature of some previous descriptionptions of tadpoles occurring in Southern Africa, and to some of the difficulties involved. A list of features useful for descriptionptions of tadpoles is given, especially of the details of structure of the tadpole mouth, and the terms rostrodont and keratodont are coined for certain cornifications forming part of the masticatory apparatus. These features are embodied in a framework of alternatives useful in descriptionptions. Keys are given to the families, subfamilies, genera and species of Southern African tadpoles as far as these are known. A diagrammatic field key is also provided. Only 6 species of Anura, other than Bufo spp. and Breviceps spp., found within this region are too insufficiently known to be included. Diagnoses of hitherto undescriptionbed tadpoles are given for the following species: Xenopus muelleri, Cacosternum namaquense, Cacosternum nanum, Ptychadena subpunctata, Pt. vernayi? Rana vertebralis, Stronglylopus hymenopus. The general literature on tadpoles is briefly surveyed, and a detailed systematic list of references is given.",

    "abstract": "Four species of spiders, namely Desis formidabilis (Cambridge), 1890 (Amaurobiidae: Desinae); Amaurobioides africanus Hewitt, 1917 (Miturgidae: Amaurobioidinae); Muizenbergia abraham; Hewitt, 1915 (Hahniidae: Hahniinae) and Erigonopsis littoralis Hewitt, 1915(Erigonidae), were found permanently inhabiting the intertidal zone of the rocky shores of Island, Kommetjie on the western coast of the Cape Peninsula, South Africa. The intertidal zone of the Island was surveyed and a map drawn to show the distribution of the four species. The habitats are compared. D. formidabilis was found to inhabit areas of the rocky shore situated between Low Water Neap and High Water Neap Tides, and A. africanus areas between High Water Neaps and High Water Springs. Both species were found in very large numbers. M. abrahami and E. littoralis were both sparcely distributed in areas inhabited by D. formidabilis. Physical factors, behavioural adaptations and biotic factors were investigated in order to discover whether any of these are responsible for the sharp delimitation between the territories of D. formidabilis and A. africanus. Wave action was found to strongly determine the location of nest sites in both species but to be of no importance in their interspecific distribution. Selective choice of nest material, depending on the nature of mollusc shells used and the amount of exposure to wave action, is demonstrated for both. Both species are shown through measurements to make use of an equally effective physical gill and to be able to sustain prolonged immersion. Anatomical and histological investigations of the body surface, booklungs and spiracles have failed to prove the existence of a plastron. They are shown to be able to withstand an extreme condition of desiccation, and there is an indication that D. formidabilis is more susÂ­ceptible to temperatures above 20Â°C. The relative humidity of their micro-habitat is shown not to vary to any significant degree. Both spiders are nocturnal and have adapted their periods of activity to tidal rhythms. The eggs of D. formidabilis were found to be parasitised by a Scelionid wasp belonging to a new genus and species, namely Echthrodesis lamorali Masner, 1968. A new species of Mesostigmatid mite belonging to the genus Veigeiia (Veigeiidae) was found living in and around the nests of D. formidabilis and A. africanus. In D. formidabilis and A. africanus intraspecific competition for nesting sites only becomes a problem when prospective sites are scarce. Density of populations is governed by availability of nesting sites only and not by territorial behaviour. Interspecific competition for nesting sites is very marked on territorial fringes. Experimental evidence has shown that D. formidabilis usually outfights A. africanus, apparently due to the fact that D. formidabilis has larger chelicerae, and this appears to be one of the factors controlling the distribution of A. africanus. Part of the diet of D. formidabilis and A. africanus together with an apparent prey selectivity characteristic of each spider are descriptionbed. The latter is offered as a possible answer to the distribution of these two spiders.",

The genera are arranged by tribe, or by group of small tribes, and a master key to tribes provides the entree to the individual keys in which the genera appear. Annotations are given at each generic exit that indicate the number of species known in the genus from the area covered, and that cite pertinent references for species-level identification; when appropriate, the existence of known but undescriptionbed species or of much-needed generic revision is noted. An annotated glossary of key characters and terms precedes the keys, toÂ­gether with a systematically arranged check-list of the genera to orientate the user into the classificaÂ­tion adopted. The host-relations of the Tachinidae concerned in the work are briefiy reviewed for their relevance to identification, and a synoptic list of known hosts for each tachinid genus is included in the review. Study of types and other material for key preparation showed the need for a few nomenclatural changes. These include the establishment of five new synonyms in generic names, two new synonyms in specific names, eight new combinations, the resurrection of three hitherto synonymous names to use for valid genera, and the descriptionption of two new species (one for a new genus and the other for a genus not previously recognised in the area covered): all such changes are detailed in comments to the check-list of genera. Four genera are recognised as present in the tachinid fauna of southern Africa that are additional to those listed in a recent catalogue (Crosskey 1980) and are included in the keys: they are Apomorphomyia Crosskey gen. n., Plagiomima Brauer & Bergenstamm, Schembria Rondani and Stomina Robineau-Desvoidy.",

Pans are endorheic wetlands that can be perennial or ephemeral in nature. They are widespread in arid and semi-arid regions throughout the world. Although phyllopod crustaceans dominate pan communities in arid regions, the invertebrate communities of perennial pans have not been well studied. The aim of the current research was to characterise the invertebrate communities of several pans (both natural and impaired). A combination of taxonomic and functional approaches was followed to study these communities. The macroinvertebrate species diversity of the pans was comparable to similar ecosystems in southern Africa and other parts of the world. Results indicate large spatial and temporal variations in diversity. This variation became less obvious when the analysis was based on biological traits. It was also evident that both coal mining and agricultural activities had an impact on the aquatic invertebrate community structures. These changes were apparent in both the diversity and the biological traits of the invertebrate communities of adjacent pans.",

The Elmo site has produced tens of thousands of specimens from which more than 150 species of insects have been described. Equally productive and more widespread geographically, but less well-known, are the Midco, Oklahoma beds located some 270 km south of Elmo. The Midco beds have also yielded tens of thousands of specimens, but the material has been less well studied, and only half as many species have been identified from there. Renewed attention has been given in recent years to both the geology and palaeontology of the Wellington Formation. The history of these insect beds is recounted and the insect faunal composition is briefly reviewed. There are nearly 200 species in 106 genera, 53 families and 21 orders. Sizes (as measured by mean forewing length) range from 1.9 mm to 330 mm, with a mean of 22 mm and a median of 12 mm. Ten of 13 species with fore wings greater than 50 mm in length are Protodonata. Most species are known from one or a few specimens (abundance ranges from 1 to just under 400 specimens per species). Of ten species for which 50 or more specimens are known, eight are Grylloblattida (and six of these Grylloblattida: Lemmatophorina), indicating that these taxa were either quite abundant or were preferentially preserved, or both. When reviewing the holotype/neotype specimens used to describe the Wellington Formation species, we find that 62% consist of fore wings, while 9% are complete specimens. However, when considering all known specimens, 48% of the species are known only by their fore wings, while 13% are now represented by complete specimens, indicating the importance of continued collecting and review of Wellington Formation insect fossils.",

The analysis revealed all described taxa to be valid and furthermore uncovered the existence of a fourth taxon, described as Liotrigona kinzelbachi sp. n.

The Maghrebian Hottentotta was historically recognised as a single species, H. franzwerneri (Birula, 1914), divided in two subspecies with disjunct distributions. A recent morphological study raised both Maghreb subspecies to species level, H. franzwerneri and H. gentili (Pallary, 1924). In this study we assess the phylogenetic relationships between specimens of the genus Hottentotta from Morocco using cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1) mitochondrial DNA sequences. Our finding of H. gentili in the eastern portion of Morocco increases the known range of this taxon and significantly reduces the geographic distance that separates it from H. franzwerneri. Furthermore, we found four well supported clades in the Maghrebian Hottentotta. All H. franzwerneri specimens group in the franzwerneri clade, but H. gentili specimens group in three different clades. The Ziz valley clade form a sister group to the franzwerneri clade, specimens from the core range of H. gentili group in the central clade, while specimens from the southern distribution of the species group in the Low Draa valley clade, basal in our tree. These findings challenge current Hottentotta taxonomy because they imply paraphyly of H. gentili, although mitochondrial introgression cannot be excluded. Further studies are needed to fully comprehend the taxonomy of Hottentotta from this region and the role that colour characters play in scorpion species diagnoses.",

    "abstract": "The Asian and Indo-Australasian fig tree species Ficus microcarpa and F. religiosa are widely-planted street and garden ornamentals in southern Africa and elsewhere. Like other fig trees, they depend for pollination on host specific fig wasps (Agaonidae). Their pollinators have also been widely introduced, and this allows the trees to become naturalised weeds. Both trees also support numerous non-pollinating fig wasps that can reduce seed or pollinator numbers, and a sub-set of these assemblages also now have wide distributions outside their native range. Two South African pollinators (Elisabethiella baijnathi, E. stuckenbergi), a galler (Otitesella uluzi) and a parasitoid (Sycoryctes species) occasionally succeed in reproducing in the figs of F. microcarpa, but in very small numbers. The tree's usual pollinator is absent but three Asian gallers of F. microcarpa are now widely established (Odontofroggatia corneri, Odontofroggatia galili and Walkerella microcarpae), and a fourth native species has expanded its host range and is developing as a parasitoid of the Odontofroggatia species (Sycophila punctum). In contrast, the Asian pollinator of F. religiosa (Platyscapa quadraticeps) has colonised South Africa and Zambia and is likely to be present throughout southern Africa. No non-pollinator associates have been recorded in the region. Without its usual pollinator, F. microcarpa cannot reproduce, but F. religiosa may eventually become established in areas with a suitable climate.",

Insect and host plant samples were collected for species identification and nutritive analyses. Additionally, live caterpillars were taken to feed and keep until pupation and eclosion of the imago, necessary for morphological species identification. Altogether, 18 insect species eaten by humans were recorded. Twenty four edible insect species were formerly known from the country, four of which are confirmed in this study and 14 species additionally recorded. Sciatta inconcisa Walker, 1869 (Erebidae) and Gastroplakaeis rubroanalis Wichgraf, 1913 (Lasiocampidae) are reported for the very first time as human dietary foods. All 18 species are illustrated and DNA-Barcodes are provided to enable re-identification of species. Though much effort has been undertaken for the identification of the 18 species, only 14 species have been identified at species level and another four only at family level. The scientific names are listed along with the vernacular names. A nutritional analysis is provided for nine species most of which are consumed in the villages, but some are also traded, for which a market study has been conducted. Information is also given on traditional collection and preparation as well as cultural aspects of edible insects in Northern Angola.",

    "abstract": "Eudrilus eugeniae (Kinberg, 1867), an adaptable exemplar of an anatomically advanced earthworm having direct fertilisation, is reviewed ecologically. A tropical West African species originating in savannah soils, it thrives on organically rich substrates. It has a rapid life-cycle from cocoon to maturity in as little as 47 days. Presence of this worm raised experimental pasture yields up to 83.9 %. Copious pellet-like casts deposited onto the soil surface are sought by roots. Passage of organic material through its gut reduces microbial pathogens and the resulting vermicompost product has enhanced nutrients, and microbial and enzymatic properties. Preliminary pharmaceutical reports are of inhibition of 'Golden staph' Staphylococcus aureus and 'Thrush' Candida albicans, plus anti-tumour effects in cancer cell lines. Its handling characteristics make this worm highly suitable for vermiculture with ecological and economic provisioning of: (1) fishing bait or 'seed' cultures, (2) high-protein worm biomass for stock feeds, (3) organic fertiliser, (4) bio-stabilisation of contaminated matrices/fluids, (5) recycling of organic 'wastes', (6) carbon sequestration in soil organic matter (SOM, or humus), (7) bio-prospecting for pharmaceuticals, cosmetics or 'silk', and (8) eco-toxicology/ ethology research. New reports are of cultivation in Denmark, South Africa, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Ecuador, Peru, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. Eudrilus eugeniae is figured and its ecological profile, global distribution and taxonomy updated with mtDNA barcodes.",

    "abstract": "The entomofauna of the Tatarian insect beds within the Newcastle Coal Measures at Belmont, north of Sydney, was described many years ago. A new collection contains some undescribed species, particularly beetles; a new exposure of the fossiliferous deposits is now documented. The Newcastle Coal Measures consist of sandstones, conglomerates, shales, coal and tuffs, which were deposited in the Hunter Trough. The depositional environment consisted of a series of very shallow, stagnant freshwater pools along a gravel river channel system within a regional coal swamp. A volcanic event produced a volcanic ash dump, causing a snapshot kill of insects, validating possible interpretation of percentages of insect fossils in ecological modelling. The pool community included Conchostraca, Permosyne beetles and extremely rare insect larvae. A community on swamp banks adjacent to the water courses was comprised of Glossopteris-dominated flora and Phyllotheca, with an insect-dominated, first-level consumer community of phloem-feeding Hemiptera and possibly pollenivorous Mecoptera. A leaf-litter and bark-dwelling community included Protelytroptera, Psocoptera and archostematan Coleoptera. Neuroptera, extremely rare Trichoptera, and ancestors of the Orthoptera were also present in small numbers. Adult Neuroptera fossils suggest the presence of their predatory larvae and this group, along with the Odonata, are considered to have been the predatory components within this environment. No chelicerates, tetrapods or other potential top predators have been found in this, or proximal, facies. Disruptive colour patterns in some of the insects may indicate predator-prey relationships. Of interest also is the identification of a number of Glossopteris leaves with chewed margins. If these observations are correct, they would represent one of the earliest records of this kind of ichnofossil in Australia.",

Their predicted geographic distributions in South Africa were modelled using maximum entropy analysis of selected climatic variables. The most important environmental variables in modelling the distributions were the magnitude of monthly rainfall and the magnitude of the monthly maximum temperature for L. sericata and the seasonal variation in monthly mean humidity and magnitude of monthly rainfall for L. cuprina. A clear geographical bias was shown in museum records and supports the need for focused surveys. There was no correlation between the predicted distribution of L. cuprina and sheep farming in South Africa, nor between the predicted distribution of L. sericata and human population density.

All the species are listed, the localities in which they have been found are grouped according to a system of climatic regions, and the distribution data are summarized in table form. There is a commentary on the nature and composition of the tabanid fauna, and data are presented for each climatic region detailing the number of species present, degree of endemism and extent to which the different tribes are represented. The geographical source of Wahlberg's material and the course of his travels are discussed, and it is shown that he did not collect in the south-eastern part of the Cape Province once called 'Kaffraria'. Conclusions are drawn regarding species density, areas of endemism, geographical features associated with endemic taxa, discontinuities in the tabanid fauna, and the thoroughness of collecting. The following new synonymies are established: Philoliche (Buplex) leucomelas (Wied.) 1828 = Buplex albicinctus Austen 1937; Philoliche (Ommatiosteres) caffra (Macq.) 1847 = Pangonia ramulifera Loew 1863; Braunsiomyia cinerea (Surcouf) 1921 = B. tigrina Dias & Sousa Junior 1957; Haematopota albihirta Karsch 1877 = H. diasi Dias 1956, and H. tropai Dias 1956.",

Gengis Fennah, 1949, Gengidae, is made a synonym of Acrometopum StA¥l, 1853, formerly assigned to Issidae. The genera Camerunilla Haglund, Eucameruna Melichar, Durium StA¥l, Heinsenia Melichar, Obedas Jacobi, Gergithomorphus Haglund and Spathocranus Muir, are transferred from Issidae to Tropiduchidae, and Mahanorona Distant is transferred from Issidae to Dictyopharidae.

Supplementary descriptionptions are given of Afrachilus mirabilis Fennah (Achilidae), Risius spurcus StA¥l and Strongylodemas circulare StA¥l (Dictyopharidae), and Microeurybrachys vitrifrons Muir (Gengidae). New records are given for species of Delphacidae, Achilidae, Dictyopharidae, Tropiduchidae and lssidae. Many of the species in the various families show strongly convergent features involving the nature ofthe integument and tegmina, body shape, brachypterism or apterism, and coloration. A high proportion of such species is associated with the distinctive macchia vegetation of the Cape fold mountains and the Eastern Highlands of South Africa; a few species have become adapted along with elements of the macchia to arid karoo conditions. The convergent features apparently can be attributed to the environmental conditions in which the macchia has evolved and which it offers to its inhabitants.",

    "abstract": "This essay has grown out of some detailed observations on the chaetotaxy of the legs in the genus Geckobia, undertaken originally with a view to providing diagnostic characters to the many species of that genus. Extension of the observations to the other genera of the Pterygosomidae has afforded me so much of interest and delight that the temptation to discuss the preliminary observations has proved irresistible. The study has also provided much food for thought and speculation, some of which is included as foci for discussion rather than as confident hypotheses. Relatively few observations have been made, especially of males and immature stages and no detailed analysis of infra-specific variation has been attempted. The work of Goksu, Wharton and Yunker (1960) on such variation in laboratory-reared populations of Trombicula (Leptotrombidium) akamushi amply demonstrates the folly of too-easy acceptance of setation patterns. Certainly such variation does occur often as loss or duplication of one or more setae. However, it commonly affects only one leg and is easily recognized in the majority of cases. While much of the material discussed here is directly relevant to taxonomy, this is not the primary object of the essay. Important taxonomic data have been intentionally omitted as such is readily obtainable from the works listed in the bibliography. Especial mention must be made however of the fine studies by Dr R. F. Lawrence himself on the Pterygosomidae of South Africa which, together with the work of Mr A. S. Hirst and Mr F. Cunliffe, have supplied invaluable information on the habit of these parasites. References to important work on chaetotaxy have been omitted in the main as a useful list has been given already by Dr R. V. Southcott (1961).",

The following new genus groups are defined: Setomima subgenus Ophryosetomima subg. n. and Mormia Enderlein subgenus Afromormia subg. n. These taxa are placed in tribes, as named by Enderlein, that differ in composition from those recognised by other authors. Setomima is redefined, using a series of new characters. The African species are revised, a key is provided, and the genealogical relationships of the genus are analysed. It is shown that this is a relatively primitive (cladistically basal) genus of Maruinini, outstanding for its structural diversity, and by virtue of its primitive characteristics, linked morphologically with Alepia Enderlein, Neoarisemus and ParatelÂ­matoscopus Satchell, but not necessarily close to them genealogically. Gerobrunettia Quate & Quate is annectant between Setomima and Brunettia Annandale, and Gerobrunettia, Brunettia and Mormia (the Tribe Mormiini) form the apomorph sister group of Setomima and its immediate relatives in the Tribe Maruinini. It appears that the furca of Paramormiini evolved from a 'ball-and-socket' articulation between gonocoxal apodemes and aedeagal apodeme, as seen in Maruinini. The following taxonomic changes are included: Satchelliella Vaillant is a new subjective synonym of Pneumia Enderlein, Krekiella Vaillant and Seoda Enderlein are new Subjective synonyms of Telmatoscopus subg.

The variability of the 88 studied specimens of the dominant Lower Toarcian cockroach Blattula langfeldti (Geinitz, 1880) (Blattulidae) is found to be much greater than the variability of Lower Cretaceous Blattulidae of the same size.

    "abstract": "Natalina sensu lato includes some of the largest carnivorous snails in the world and represents an important African radiation of the Gondwanan land snail family Rhytididae. It comprises the taxa Natalina, Afrorhytida and Capitina, all three of which we treat as full genera. We provide a comprehensive revision of each genus, and update the species-level taxonomy extensively in the light of new molecular and morphological data. Detailed comparative morphological observations are provided for the distal reproductive tract (including spermatophores for the first time in this family), pulmonary cavity, mantle edge, radula and suprapedal gland. In addition, we present a summary of biological and ecological data including information on habitat preferences, feeding, prey and mating behaviour. Although the genera are well circumscribed in terms of both morphological and molecular data, morphology is usually highly conserved within genera. Yet surprising cryptic diversity is evident within the described species and restricted-range endemism is more frequent than was previously thought, with significant implications for conservation. The widespread common cannibal snail, Natalina cafra (Férussac, 1821), is shown to comprise four cryptic, allopatric lineages. For the most part, we recognise this cryptic diversity at the level of subspecies. In some cases where populations from disjunct, lime-rich habitats exhibit a significantly different shell morphology, it is difficult to evaluate whether and to what extent this is genetically or environmentally determined. Spermatophores exhibit considerable phylogenetically consistent morphological variation and may eventually prove to be an important source of new taxonomic characters. The geographic distributions of the respective lineages are interpreted in the light of phylogenetic data, current regional vegetation patterns, and historical environmental phenomena, so as to identify biogeographic trends. Some lineages are clearly forest-associated specialists and have fragmented, narrowly-endemic distributions resulting from cyclical changes in forest cover during the Plio-Pleistocene, but there is also strong evidence for regional endemism associated with other vegetation types, notably Albany Thicket. Observations on the conservation status of all taxa are provided.New subgenus: Natalina (Tongalina). New species: Afrorhytida burseyae, Capitina calcicola. New subspecies: Afrorhytida kraussi oraria, Natalina cafra amathole, Natalina cafra natalensis, Natalina quekettiana dracomontana, Natalina quekettiana lucaris, Natalina quekettiana montistempli.

Following a detailed comparison of the somatic and genitalic morphology of the Afrotropical C. martini (Simon, 1897) with the European type species, C. laticeps (Canestrini, 1868), Afroceto gen. n. is established to include the transfer of two Afrotropical species previously described in Cetonana, namely A. martini (Simon, 1897) comb. n.

Three species are proposed as junior synonyms of A. martini, namely C. curvipes (Tucker, 1920) syn. n., C. tridentata (Lessert, 1923) syn. n. and C. simoni (Lawrence, 1942) syn. n.

This finding adds to the sparse record of Late Devonian scorpion taxa and provides the first evidence of Palaeozoic scorpions from Gondwana. Material includes a complete chela with associated patella as well as a telson with associated metasomal segment V, resembling those of the Mesoscorpionina. This is the first record of a scorpion occurring at high latitudes. Its close resemblance to contemporary taxa from Laurasia and China is consistent with evidence from the type locality for increasingly uniform terrestrial ecosystems by the end of the Devonian, characterised by cosmopolitan plant genera such as the progymnosperm tree Archaeopteris. In part, this may reflect increasing proximity between Laurasia and Gondwana towards the end of the Devonian. These specimens also provide the earliest record of terrestrial animals in Gondwana.",

    "abstract": "Because many of this group of molluscs possess shells they have had relatively more attention from conchologists than most other opisthobranchiate molluscs yet they are not so well known as they deserve to be. Many of the records already published from the area apply to shells only and since these are light and buoyant they may be carried far from the haunt of the living animal. Hence a record, based on the finding of the shell alone may not be a valid one. This applies to many of the records resulting from the collections of Col. W.H. Turton who collected shells on the beaches of Port Alfred and district. In this paper will be found records and short descriptionptions of sixteen species most of which are widely distributed in the Indo-west-Pacific biogeographic region. Some, however, are strangely local in their distribution: in particular the species of Haminea of which four appear to replace one another successively round the coast with only a slight overlap between species. The coast line from which specimens have been studied extends from the vicinity of Cape Town to Inhaca island in southern MoA§ambique. Collections examined originated from the Ecological Survey of University of Cape Town (U.C.T. in the records which follow) the Zoological Department of the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg (U.W.) and from the author's own collection (W.

This classification is tested by means of a transect. Virtually the whole area is included in the ranges of five species, while 24 species and subÂ­species are endemic, mostly localised on the eastern uplands. These uplands have the greatest species diversity (total of 79 species and subspecies), receiving subtraction margins of the eastern and the western plains faunas in addition to the upland complex.

    "abstract": "The structure of the male gonopods of millipedes has been considered to be species-specific. As such, gonopods—which aid in copulation and sperm transfer—are used in the taxonomic diagnosis and description of species. However, it was recently demonstrated that gonopod morphology is not always characteristic of species. Diagnoses based on gonopod morphology can therefore result in underestimation of taxonomic diversity amongst millipedes. On the basis of this observation, we examined genetic variation in two populations (approximately 250 km apart) of a widely distributed and colour-polymorphic southern African millipede, namely Bicoxidens flavicollis Attems, 1928. An analysis of genetic divergence based on 520 nucleotides of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 gene, and 684 nucleotides of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene, demonstrated high levels of divergence (19.09% for cytochrome oxidase 1 and 6.66% for 16S rRNA) between the two populations. These results suggest the presence of cryptic species in B. flavicollis and, furthermore, corroborate observations that taxonomy based on gonopod morphology may be too inclusive.",

    "abstract": "Solen cylindraceus (Hanley, 1843) is an infaunal bivalve that in the St Lucia Estuary is currently restricted to the southern part of its South Lake, having disappeared from the northern reaches due to persisting hypersaline conditions (>70 ‰) and air exposure at low water levels. The system experiences marked fluctuations in salinity due to quasi-decadal changes from wet to dry periods. In this study, the salinity tolerance of S. cylindraceus is determined using both shock and gradual change tests. Animals were collected at Catalina Bay (eastern shores of South Lake) and acclimated under laboratory conditions to naturally occurring salinities of 50 ‰ and 45 ‰ for the shock and gradual test, respectively. Mortalities were recorded for animals exposed to a sudden change in salinity, using eight different treatments ranging from 0 to 80 ‰. The second test involved exposing bivalves to a gradual change in salinity, using eight different treatments from 0 to 85 ‰. In the shock test, the lower salinity tolerance limit for S. cylindraceus was 30 ‰ and the upper 60 ‰, while in the gradual test, these limits were 15 and 65 ‰, respectively. The time it took for 50 % of animals to die increased from the shock to the gradual test for 10, 20 and 70 ‰, and decreased for 0 and 80 ‰. This knowledge may be useful towards predicting major crises in the S. cylindraceus populations, as drought and flood events alternate in the region. Major losses will be expected when salinities exceed 65 ‰ during dry phases or drop below 15 ‰ during flood events.",

    "abstract": "Eleven species of flesh fly were identified in a sample of 737 specimens captured during fortnightly trapping at three sites in Grahamstown, South Africa, over a year. Sarcophaga africa Wiedemann, 1824, S. inaequalis Austen, 1909, S. exuberans Pandellé, 1896 and S. tibialis Macquart, 1851 showed well-defined peaks between early October 2001 and late April 2002, and only S. africa was trapped at other times of year. These peaks occurred when average minimum and maximum ambient air temperatures were above 12°C and 22°C, respectively, and showed no obvious relationship to rainfall. There were indications of population cycles in all of these species. Sarcophaga hera Zumpt, 1972, S. arno Curran, 1934, S. inzi Curran, 1934, S. langi Curran, 1934, S. freyi Zumpt, 1953, S. nodosa Engel, 1925 and S. samia Curran, 1934 were too scarce to assess their patterns of occurrence rigorously. Insects attending a corpse are reputed to assist forensic entomologists in estimating the time of year when the body died. Some flesh flies provide more precise estimates than others, so several species should be used for cross-validation. Insect activity at a corpse depends on the weather, so that presence of a species indicates particular environmental conditions and not simply calendar dates (particularly if climate changes). Absence of a species is not necessarily evidence of specific conditions because species may not be present at all sites simultaneously, populations cycle even when their members are active, and low population densities may hamper detection of a species.",

    "abstract": "The St Lucia Estuary is part of the iSimangaliso Wetland Park, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is characterised by instability and experiences ongoing anthropomorphic change, both of which have a significant impact on the biodiversity of the estuary and surrounding area. Brachyurans (true crabs) play an integral role in the functioning and maintenance of this ecosystem. They are a food source for organisms at higher trophic levels, maintain nutrient balance, regulate trophic flow and aerate dense mud through the construction of burrows. However, since the early survey of Millard and Broekhuysen (1970), no study has focussed on this taxon, the identification of which is confounded by the existence of cryptic and pseudocryptic species. This study provides a census of the brachyuran species inhabiting the St Lucia estuarine lake, highlighting the changes in diversity that have occurred in this region between 1948 and 2012. A total of thirty species were found in the area during this period, five of which have not been recorded in previous literature. The extent to which regional endemic species, such as Paratylodiplax blephariskios, have been affected by the dynamics of the system is discussed. The distribution and abundance of three key species, namely P. blephariskios, Neosarmatium africanum and Hymenosoma projectum, are outlined; and possible reasons for observed changes are discussed. Future scenarios regarding the state of the estuary mouth and the stability of physico-chemical variables are also considered. Lastly, an annotated checklist illustrated by photographs is included to aid in identification of species for research and management purposes.",

Since that time, very little taxonomic research has been undertaken on this group and only seven additional species have been added to the regional fauna. In this study we document the history of taxonomic research and of species discovery for the South African anemone fauna, report on further additions to the fauna, and document expanded distributional ranges of known species. This study presents data from our own collections, as well as from the examination of historical data and museum collections, and from photographic records and specimens collected by SCUBA divers. Based on these data, two newly-discovered, but still un-described species, along with 12 new records, are added to the list of South African sea anemones. In addition, the ranges of 39 previously-known species are expanded. These new discoveries raise the total number of Actiniaria and Corallimorpharia species recognised from South African waters to 63.",

    "abstract": "Considering the precarious conservation status of the grassland biome in South Africa, effective assessment and monitoring is imperative. The potential use of terrestrial arthropods in ecological assessment has received much attention, but little headway has been made in formulating standardised bioassessment protocols. A suggested reason for this lack of progress is the high diversity of terrestrial arthropods and the high taxonomic expertise required. Sampling was carried out across 12 months in the Bloemfontein Dry Grassland vegetation type and the potential of using functional feeding groups (FFG) as taxonomic surrogates for family level arthropods was investigated. An F-test associated with an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) found a significant correlation between FFG and families for measures of richness, Shannon and Simpson diversity. Accumulation curves indicated that a higher proportion of FFG than families could be assessed with the same sampling intensity. Both families and FFG best fitted the stochastic normal and geometric series relative abundance distribution models, implying that there is no distinction between the taxonomic units with regard to abundance distributions. The reality remains that information does become lost when using surrogacy, so there will continue to be a need for specialist ecological proficiency for the highest risk assessments. It was concluded that for rapid monitoring and snap-shot assessments, FFG could be used as a valuable and reliable taxonomic surrogate.",

The St Lucia estuarine lake exhibits sub-decadal changes from wet to dry periods, resulting in fluctuating physico-chemical conditions. This paper represents a census of the diversity of bivalve molluscs in this estuary, emphasising changes associated with climate-induced hydrological states. Twenty-four bivalve species were recorded within St Lucia between 1925 and 2011. Twelve that had not been reported previously from St Lucia in the literature were encountered during the present study. These are Anadara natalensis, Anomia achaeus, Arcuatula capensis, Chambardia wahlbergi, Corbicula fluminalis, Dendostrea sandvichensis, Fulvia fragilis, Mactra cuneata, Martesia striata, Meretrix meretrix, Saccostrea forskahlii and Tellina s.l. bertini. Single shells of another two previously unrecorded species, Anodontia edentula and Timoclea lavrani, were also found, although these may have been introduced dead from the ocean through tidal exchange. Meretrix meretrix, an unexpected yet abundant species, represents a new record for South African waters, but the timing and mode of its introduction into the estuary remain unresolved. Extremely large numbers (>100 ind.m-2)of dead specimens of Barnea manilensis were observed in 2011 along the western shoreline of the estuarine lake, which indicates that the species was a major role-player in the settling of suspended silt within the system. Currently, this function appears to be fulfilled only by Solen cylindraceus. Apart from this species, Brachidontes virgiliae, Dosinia hepatica, Macomopsis moluccensis, Salmacoma litoralis and an undescribed Tellina sp. (reported here as T. cf. rousi) are the only bivalves that were found alive in St Lucia during the latest survey, in March 2011.",

It is a keystone species along the west coast of South Africa, where it pollinates, partly or exclusively, the long-tubed flowers of at least 20 species of Iridaceae, Geraniaceae and Orchidaceae. M. longirostris has been widely discussed in the pollination biology literature and has a suggested co-evolutionary arms race between it and the long-tubed flowers it pollinates.A current taxonomic revision has presented new biogeographical and morphometric data. Available records suggest that the species is widely distributed along the west coast of South Africa between about 29°30′S and 34°15′S, a distance of almost 500 km. It is restricted to sandy, lowland coastal plains at less than 300 m, where it occurs in nine different vegetation types across seven bioregions and is consequently not a habitat specialist.Proboscis length from 13 localities ranged from 32 to 83 mm, and mean proboscis length at these localities from 32 to 71 mm. There was a decline in proboscis length with increasing latitude south. Research investigating a possible allometric relationship between body size and proboscis length, and between latitude and proboscis length, is required.",

    "abstract": "Earthworms are an important component of southern African invertebrate diversity, due both to their influential roles in soil ecosystems, and the relatively large number of species. As of 2010, there were 282 indigenous earthworm species (most endemic) known to South Africa belonging to three families: Microchaetidae, Tritogeniidae and Acanthodrilidae. In addition, 44 introduced species from six families had been recorded. However, earthworms are rarely included in environmental monitoring or conservation programmes—partly because sampling and species identification are difficult and many sampling methods are destructive and/or toxic. In this paper we review the earthworm sampling techniques most commonly used by screening data from a digitised literature collection on South African earthworms and on-line global searches. By examining a case study sampling of three vegetation types, this paper highlights taxonomic challenges and the effort required to properly curate specimens. The study provides recommendations for future sampling and highlights some key priorities for future work on the group.From the literature review in early 2012, it is clear that collection techniques are often insufficiently recorded in published work. A total of 10 938 publications from the period 1950 to 2012 were found from the literature search and digitised collection and from these only 32 papers recorded the sampling methodology (mainly hand sorting) for South African research, pointing to the need to adopt standard sampling and reporting protocols. We also tested two of the most popular methodologies in the field. Sampling was conducted in January and February 2012 at four sites, with 24 plots at each site (12 digging and 12 using mustard extraction). A total of 2 094 earthworms collected could be assigned a species name, with introduced species predominating at both disturbed and natural sites. It took a team of three to five people digging and hand collecting all earthworm specimens encountered in a plot of 50 cm × 50 cm × 20 cm deep around 45 to 60 minutes. However, much more time was spent curating and identifying samples. While we recommend following the ISO (ISO11268-3, ISO23611-1) protocol for collecting introduced taxa, to get a complete inventory of South African earthworms a range of sampling techniques will be required; in particular, a large 1 m × 1 m × 20 cm plot is required for many large bodied native taxa, and the collection of giant earthworms will require different approaches. The identification of specimens requires skills that are scarce in the country and so there is an urgent need for training and funding for fundamental work on earthworm taxonomy. An atlasing project could serve as a focal point for future research. In providing some general recommendations based on the long and fruitful history of research on earthworms in South Africa, we are optimistic that a better understanding of the group will help us to both improve our usage of natural resources and provide insights into this vitally important edaphic group.",

    "abstract": "Forest restoration often involves monitoring programmes to determine whether biodiversity levels and ecosystem services have changed over time. This study investigated changes in ground-hunting spider communities (families Ctenidae, Lycosidae and Zodariidae) in an actively restored forest, an unrestored gravel mine, and two alternative land-use types (agroforestry system and an arable field) to assess whether a two-decade post-mine restoration programme has been successful in restoring biodiversity to levels of a reference natural forest. The overall activity density of ground-hunting spiders (based on both juveniles and adult specimens) was highest in the natural and the restored forest in the dry season and lowest in the arable field and agroforestry system in the wet season. The inverse Simpson index was highest at the gravel site in the wet season, followed by natural forest in both seasons and lower values in the restored forest. The community composition of spiders differed significantly between land-use types (open versus forest habitats) and the interaction between land use and season also differed significantly. The species Pardosa injucunda and Trochosa gentilis dominated the communities in the restored forest, but Africactenus monitor dominated the natural forest and Hogna gratiosa dominated communities in the gravel site. Surprisingly, active forest restoration promoted the activity density of ground-hunting spiders displaced by mining activities to levels even higher than in the reference natural forest after two decades. However, the community composition of the restored forest was more similar to the agroforestry system than to the natural forest. These results highlight the benefits of restoring former mining sites but also show the trade-offs in terms of restoration goals, as natural forest biodiversity of spiders was not achieved after 20 years.",

Understanding these responses is important for the conservation of Lepidoptera species, especially those that are not widely distributed. Individuals of Dira clytus clytus , a South African endemic butterfly with a distribution in the southern parts of the country, were reared in captivity from the egg phase to the adult phase, to observe behaviour and phenology in the various life stages. Life history stages concurred with previous observations made on this subspecies, but additional photographs are presented for the various phases. There are clearly two pupal, and thus adult emergence, phases in spring and early summer. Four batches of eggs resulted from these adults, and the larvae from these eggs were also reared although none of them survived to the pupation phase. The timing of the two pupal phases was compared to climatic variables (temperature and rainfall) and it was found that pupation followed soon after cold temperature. This is indicative that D. c. clytus can change its phenology and voltinism in response to climatic conditions, which may allow for plasticity in responding to climate change. However, more research is required to understand how climate change would impact this endemic species.",

    "abstract": "A Rapid Assessment Protocol (RAP) for non-canopy spiders was used to collect replicate samples from four lowland rainforest sites for a proof-of-concept comparison of spider assemblages from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (hereafter, Congo) and Panama. Collecting was done at two 0.25 ha sites in Panama and two 0.25 ha sites in Congo. At each site, three 0.01 ha plots were randomly located, and within each we did 1 person-hour of aerial sampling (sweeping and beating/brushing) and two person-hours of ground sampling (field sieving of leaf litter). The samples yielded 350 adult spiders belonging to 29 spider families. The Panama samples yielded more adult spiders (235 vs. 115) and more spider families (24 vs. 14) than the Congo samples. Overall, the dominant five spider families in these non-canopy samples were Theridiidae (24%), Salticidae (15%), Linyphiidae (11%), Oonopidae (10%), and Pholcidae (7%), with the 20 remaining families each making up less than 5% of the total adults. The three most abundant families in Congo were Theridiidae, Oonopidae, and Thomisidae, while the top three in Panama were Salticidae, Theridiidae, and Linyphiidae. An NMDS ordination analysis of the four plots failed to show significant differences between any of the four assemblages, but when the plots were analyzed by region, there was a significant difference in the family-level assemblages between the continents. This paper shows proof-of-concept that this RAP can produce statistically valid data from brief sampling trips by teams with inexperienced collectors and simple, inexpensive sampling equipment.",

    "abstract": "Stegopterus Burmeister &amp; Schaum, 1840 is a Trichiini genus endemic to the Western Cape Province of South Africa. Until now, it has been regarded as comprising only four species, namely S. vittatus (Fabricius, 1775), S. suturalis (Gory &amp; Percheron, 1833), S. septus Burmeister &amp; Schaum, 1840 and S. obesus Burmeister, 1842. Our study of historical specimens housed in museums and private collections, along with new specimens collected recently, has revealed that there are at least 15 species in this genus of which 11 are new, with S. obesus relegated to incertae sedis (see updated species list below). What is most interesting is that the genus has radiated within a rather restricted region, between the South and West coasts and the Cape Fold Mountains (CFM). This reflects a typical Fynbos distribution, similar to that already described for other insect groups. On the basis of synapomorphy, Stegopterus has now been subdivided into two species groups, namely “ vittatus ” and “ septus .” In this work, 11 new species are described, diagnosed and illustrated, and their geographic distributions are mapped: Stegopterus agulhas sp. nov. , S. cochraneae sp. nov. , S. endroedyi sp. nov. , S. fuscus sp. nov. , S. hexrivieri sp. nov. , S. kromrivieri sp. nov. , S. lamellus sp. nov. , S. langebergicus sp. nov. , S. pallidulus sp. nov. , S. paardebergi sp. nov. , S. rotundiceps sp. nov .

    "abstract": "A contribution to the knowledge of Afrotropical Dryinidae (Hymenoptera : Chrysidoidea) is presented. A new subfamily, Apoaphelopinae, is proposed for Apoaphelopus, a new genus including two new species - A. mostovskii from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, and A. niassensis from Niassa, Mozambique. The following new Afrotropical species are described: from South Africa : Conganteon kolyadai, C. walkerense; Deinodryinus capensis, D. umtamvunensis; Anteon kwazuluense, A. simoni; Bocchus whiteleyi, B. kogelbergensis; Dryinus irwini ; Adryinus mostovskii; Gonatopus kolyadai; from Madagascar and South Africa : Anteon terminale; from Kenya: Thaumatodryinus sokokensis; from Cameroon : Gonatopus camposensis ; from Namibia and South Africa : Gonatopus maritimus; from Namibia : Gonatopus fortis, G. karibibensis; from Burkina Faso : Gonatopus savanensis. A new synonymy is proposed for the following genus : Prioranteon Olmi, 1984, under Deinodryinus R. Perkins, 1907. A new synonymy is proposed for the following species : Deinodryinus nigerensis Olmi, 1990, under Deinodryinus paulyi (Olmi, 1987). The following new combinations are proposed : Deinodryinus paulyi (Olmi, 1987) from Prioranteon; Gonatopus cornutus (Benoit, 1951) from Pseudogonatopus.",

Macrobiotus richtersi, Minibiotus intermedius, Hypsibius convergens, Ramazzottius theroni, Milnesium tardigradum, and Echiniscus duboisi were previously known to be part of the southern African fauna, Macrobiotus iharosi has not been reported before from this region. One species, Macrobiotus cf. echinogenitus, could be identified only to species complex because eggs were not found. One South African species, Minibiotus harrylewisi sp. n., is new to science and is described and illustrated. It differs from other Minibiotus species in its adult cuticle and its egg ornamentation. It most closely resembles M. furcatus, from which it differs in having smooth lunules on leg IV, smaller eyes, smaller and more rounded posterior cuticular pores, and eggs with a smooth shell and much longer, non-bifurcate processes. These new records bring to 61 the number of tardigrade species reported from southern African mosses, lichens and soil.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to use cytochrome c oxidase 1 (CO1) sequences to recover a phylogeny for seven morphologically described spirostreptid millipede taxa from southern Africa, and to evaluate the correspondence between morphological and molecular phylogenies. Genetic p-distance generally increased with taxonomic divergence: inter-specific mean 15.33 % (14.09 % –17.02 %), inter-generic mean 18.43 % (6.83 %–26.81 %) and inter-order mean 24.16 % (range 18.56 %–30.77 %). Congruent Bayesian, maximum parsimony and neighbour-joining analyses of 520 nucleotides of the CO1 gene resolved the orders Spirostreptida, Julida and Callipodida. Members of genera within the Spirostreptidae (Archispirostreptus, Bicoxidens, Cacuminostreptus, Doratogonus, Orthoporoides, Plagiotaphrus and Spirostreptus) formed a single clade within which a sample of Thyropygus (family Harpagophoridae) was paraphyletically nested. Phylogenetic analyses failed to recover support for the genera Doratogonus, Bicoxidens, Archispirostreptus and Spirostreptus, as representatives of these genera were not monophyletic. Samples morphologically identified as the same species (Bicoxidens flavicollis) were part of two different clades, one of which was well supported and otherwise contained members of Doratogonus. This high level of divergence (mean 12.64 %) between morphologically identified spirostreptid millipede sister species could indicate that changes in genital morphology occur rather slowly relative to CO1 sequence substitution, and may underestimate species diversity.",

    "abstract": "Leishmaniasis, an anthropozoonotic infection transmitted to humans and animals through female sandfly bite, is endemic in the far north region of Cameroon, which currently lacks a control programme. This study aimed to assess the occurrence and monthly distribution of sandflies in Kousseri County, a region with reported cases of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), to provide data needed for combatting the disease. Sandfly occurrence was evaluated by monthly deployment of six CDC light traps over a twelve-month period (from September 2020 to August 2021) in urban, peri-urban and rural ecotopes. Our survey collected 4,214 sandflies, including 51.02% females. The highest abundance of sandflies was recorded in the rural areas (43.43%, n = 1830) and in January during the dry season (16.22%, n = 679). Ten sand fly species from the Sergentomyia genus Franca and Parrot 1920 and one species of the Phlebotomus genus Rondani and Berté 1840 were identified. The monthly dynamics of the collected female sandflies varied markedly: Se. antennata Newstead, 1912, the most prevalent species and Se. squamipleuris Newstead, 1912 showed unimodal peaks in January and February, respectively; Se. schwetzi Adler, Theodor &amp; Parrot, 1929 exhibited a trimodal pattern with a major peak in September; Se. distincta followed a bimodal trend with peaks in January and May. The aforementioned sandfly species were present throughout the study period, while other species displayed variable and intermittent presence. Ph. duboscqi , the sole known vector of leishmaniasis in this study, was absent in January and July, but peaked in September, representing only 1.07% of the total catch. The Shannon–Wiener index was high ( H &amp;gt; 1) in all the collected ecotopes and months, indicating high evenness and Simpson indices. Overall, the findings suggest that sandflies are active year-round in Kousseri, with elevated abundance during the dry season, particularly in January and March. The presence of animal shelters surrounding houses, vegetation (primarily rice paddies) and building conditions with unplastered, fissured mud walls likely favour a high abundance of sandflies in rural areas in Kousseri. These findings highlight the need of optimising surveillance and intervention strategies, especially in rural settings and during months when sandflies are more active. Further studies on climatic and environmental factors affecting sandfly distribution, as well as investigations into their feeding habits and Leishmania infection rates, are crucial for enhancing disease control in the region.",

An ecological classification of genera, based on field-observed surveillance positions adopted by adults, is proposed. Six major categories, each usually subdivided into secondary categories, are employed viz. I. Ground (a. Beaches, b. River banks, c. General); 2. Stones (a. Riparian, b. General); 3. Rocks; 4. Grass (a. Within, b. Tips); 5. Shrubs & bushes (a. Within, b. Tips); 6. Trees (a. Within, b. Tips). Based on ovipositor structure, asilid genera are further analysed in terms of their oviposition behaviour within the identified ecological categories. Three oviposition strategies are identified viz. 1. Random egg-dropping; 2. Oviposition in sand or soil; 3. Oviposition on or in vegetation. Finally, based on an analysis of 1608 accumulated prey records, the importance of prey choice within the suggested ecological classification is briefly discussed. An important point arising from this work, is that field-experienced taxonomists are best placed to promote the much-needed ecological work still required to be undertaken on the vast majority of insect taxa.",

    "abstract": "Current support for myriapod monophyly is revised based on a comparative study of the head morphology in Tetramerocerata (Pauropoda) and Pselaphognatha (Diplopoda). New data on the cephalic endoskeleton permit a reconstruction of the common pattern of the myriapod 'tentorium'. Polyxenus lagurus (Pselaphognatha) shows no principle difference to the original state in the Chilognatha (Diplopoda). The state in Pauropus sp. (Tetramerocerata) also corresponds to the common pattern employed in this study. The composite nature of the 'fulturae' is emphasised, which renders this term inappropriate for outgroup comparisons. The homology of the tentorial components in myriapods is confirmed. The mobility of the tentorium is specified to be mainly based on the presence of its 'transverse bar' serving as an attachment site for the muscles that effect the forward swing of the tentorium. The manner of how the tentorial swing is translated into movements of the primarily moveably separated gnathal lobe of the mandibles, differs in the Dignatha (Pauropoda + Diplopoda) from the state in the Symphyla and Chilopoda. Tentorial mobility seems to be maintained in the Tetramerocerata, despite the fact that the mandibular gnathal lobe is no longer moveably separated from the mandible base in this group. Available data tend to favour myriapod monophyly, not only under the Pancrustacea, but also under the Tracheata hypothesis. Reserve, however, is justified due to corresponding character states in Geophilomorpha (Chilopoda) and 'Entognatha' (Hexapoda). Collembola in particular indicate that the mandibular gnathal lobe in hexapods may be secondarily fused with the mandible base. Final decisions require clarification of the origin and homology of the mandibular and tentorial muscles.",

A second New Zealand species is also descriptionbed which, like the first, has no sharp long hook and whose affinities are unknown. After discussing the genealogical relationships of the African species it is concluded that they cannot be precisely placed, but that their discovery has the effect of transforming an apparent A-S distribution into a Gondwanian distribution. It is pointed out that because in the southern hemisphere many existing species and higher level taxa are still unknown, groups descriptionbed as monophyletic may often be polyphyletic or paraphyletic in reality, and that this defect is as serious as if it had resulted from a failure to recognise affinities. Clades that possibly involve undetected polyphyly or paraphyly resulting from a lack of thorough collecting are defined as metaphyletic, and the consequences of metaphyly are discussed.",

The variability among the diverse populations was studied by statistical treatment of data through the analysis of variance. This analysis did not unveil any particular similarity among the Artemia populations studied, apart from the width of the head of male specimens (F=1.088, P=0.360). Biometrical analysis of these data was performed via multivariate discriminant analysis, and using the origin of each population as a separation factor. Results revealed that all the Tunisian Artemia populations studied can be classified as Artemia salina, with the exception of the Artemia population from Sabkhet Halk El Menzel, which belongs to Artemia franciscana.",

    "abstract": "Sixty-two years since last observed alive, Mormotomyia hirsuta Austen, the “terrible hairy fly”, was found inside and outside a large, cave-like cleft boulder at the summit of Ukasi Hill in eastern Kenya, the type locality of the species. Adults were observed climbing the walls of the boulder and walking on thick layers of bat guano, in which larvae and puparia were also discovered. Large numbers of M. hirsuta were observed on and at the base of the northern side of the boulder, which at the time of capture experienced continuous shade during daylight hours. Only three individuals were observed at the southern opening, exposed to direct sunlight and hot, dry conditions. A collection of vertebrate bones and skulls from layers of guano both inside and outside the cleft revealed several vertebrate associates, including two species of Chiroptera, Chaerephon cf. bivittatus (Heuglin) and Tadarida aegyptiaca (E. Geoffroy), which are probably the two major guano-producing species responsible for the larval breeding medium. Male-biased sexual size dimorphism was pronounced in adult M. hirsuta, with seven body-part measurements, including legs, larger by 33–61 % in males than females. Males demonstrated isometric growth while female growth was allometric. In contrast to males, female head and thorax lengths did not increase proportionally with leg length. Estimates of genetic diversity in the Ukasi population show higher than expected allelic diversity and indicate possible gene flow and frequent population bottlenecks. To promote the conservation of this endangered species, a joint effort has been initiated between the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology, Nairobi and the National Museums of Kenya, Nairobi, to gazette the Ukasi hill area as a protected site.",

Each species has its own characteristic song, usually associated with a song-flight over the territory. The nest in most, if not all, species is built by the female alone, usually within four to seven days. Eggs are laid at 24-hour intervals. To judge from the difference between mean egg measurements in summer and in winter, it is possible that two different subspecies of Eremopterix verticalis breed at different times in the Gemsbok Park. Incubation takes 12 days in all species and the chicks leave the nest at about 10 days, well before they can fly. Chicks are led away from the nest by the female parent, although both parents feed the chicks. In the genus Eremopterix both parents incubate the eggs. All species of sandveld larks have characteristic alarm- and intruder-reactions at the nest; some of them have distraction displays of the injury-feigning type, others apparently do not.",

    "abstract": "Species distribution datasets are fundamental for macroecological studies, although there is an overarching need to ensure that these datasets are representative of the entire community. Shortfalls, or knowledge gaps, within biodiversity datasets originate for a range of reasons, and can lead to incorrect conclusions or recommendations being drawn. Spatial scale influences the interpretations of diversity patterns and thus is an important aspect to consider. South Africa has a rich history of spider sampling and as such, it is possible to investigate the influence that scale, both spatial and taxonomic, has on the overall interpretations of how complete the spider knowledge base is in the country. To do this, we draw on curated natural history spider collections and determine how complete the spider assemblages are across twelve unique combinations of taxonomic and spatial scales. Overall, we received 121 605 usable records from seven collections, with spider records and diversity, being concentrated along the eastern and coastal regions of South Africa. We show that assemblage completeness increases with both increasing taxonomic and spatial scales, and as such, knowledge of the distribution of spider families at the biome level is largely complete. Moreover, we show that our fine-scale knowledge of spider assemblages in South Africa is relatively poor, yet we do identify, even at fine scales, assemblages in South Africa that can be considered complete. We identify under-sampled regions of the country, which in turn are congruent with the distribution of under-sampled regions found in other South African invertebrate groups. We show that the scaling of completeness can only be interpreted in one direction: as scale increases so does completeness. These findings will have important implications for spider research and conservation in South Africa, given that regions where completeness is highest correspond strongly to areas in South Africa with the highest threats to biodiversity.",

Phylogenetic analysis of these characters, in combination with results available from other diopsids, resolves generic but not species relationships. It confirms that this character system can be valuable for phylogenetic analysis, as suggested by previous authors. The vast enlargement of the multi-chambered ventral receptacle in Chaetodiopsis and Diasemopsis has various implications on the possibilities of sperm competition and spermatozoa selection, that deserve further investigation. The ventral receptacle possibly acquires part of the sperm storage function from the spermathecae, that are concurrently reduced in number and size. Furthermore, the parallel arrangement of several hundred chambers, housing individual spermatozoa, provides an arena for spermatozoa competition. The elongation of the chambers, coinciding with the elongation of the spermatozoa, constitutes a new example for the coevolution of spermatozoa and female sperm receptacles.",

The course taken by the bulbus and embolus in expansion of the genital bulb is descriptionbed step by step. Histological investigations of the tarsal organs of P. castaneus yielded the following hitherto unreported data: (i) The proximal and median portions of the receptaculum seminis are surrounded by two kinds of glands, namely the vesicular and syncytial glands respectively; (ii) blood vessels going to the above glandular tissue of the bulbus via the umbilical tissue (new terminology) of the retractor ligament; (iii) the absence of connections between the bulbus lacuna and the glands in the spongy tissue of the bulbus, the bulbus lacuna thus being a vascular 'cul-de-sac'; (iv) an organized arrangement of non-elastic and elastic chitinous fibres in the basal hematodocha which is responsible for the swivelling motion of the bulbus in a definite direction; (v) each spermatozoon is encapsulated. Sperm induction is probably achieved by capillary force or resorption of secretions in the lumen of the receptaculum seminis or even more possibly a combination of both factors. The mechanism operating ejaculation of sperm in P. castaneus is shown to be probably by the secretion of a colloidal substance from the vesicular glands into the fundus of the receptaculum seminis via small pores in its walls. The force pushing this secretory mass is probably the combination of hydrostatic pressure togeÂ­ther with release of turgor pressure from the glands supplying this secretion. Stimulation of the glands is brought about by an endocrine factor probably released by a neurosecretory mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Autochthonous aquatic arthropods are only rarely found in the sediments of the Eocene Lake Messel. This has led to the assumption that certain abiotic conditions prevented a stable colonisation of aquatic groups. In recent years, the analysis of small fossil fish coprolites has shown that aquatic life was present in the former Lake Messel. A food web of different taxa of aquatic insect larvae and crustaceans was traced. Very abundant among the remains in the coprolites are larvae and pupae of phantom midges (Diptera : Chaoboridae). This article focuses on the survey of identified remains of immature chaoborids in the coprolites. In addition, it gives an outline of the major role that large populations of phantom midges can play in the pelagic ecosystem of a lake. Chaoborids are important both as prey for planktivorous fish and as predators of the smaller zooplankton. Via comparison with extant meromictic lakes, one can infer that the older phantom midge larvae displayed a vertical diurnal migration behaviour. They probably remained during the day within the anoxic water layers of the monimolimnion of the former Lake Messel to minimise the effect of predation by planktivorous fish. Lakes with large chaoborid populations are known to exist since the Jurassic.",

Erongo Region), is updated, based on a survey of the Massif and surrounding areas (the region delimited by 21°00′S–21°30′S and 14°00′–15°00′E) conducted during three separate expeditions, and augmented by an examination of material in museum collections. More than 1000 specimens, representing more than 100 point-locality records, were examined for the study. Notes on the ecology and distribution of the scorpions on the Massif and surrounding areas are provided. Excluding one dubious record, 20 scorpion species in seven genera (Brandbergia, Lisposoma, Hottentotta, Parabuthus, Uroplectes, Hadogenes, and Opistophthalmus) of four families (Bothriuridae, Buthidae, Liochelidae, Scorpionidae) are recorded from the area, which presently has the richest scorpion fauna in Namibia, if not southern Africa, and ranks among those with the richest scorpion faunas in the world. The high diversity of scorpions on the Brandberg Massif and vicinity is attributed to the heterogeneity of landforms, substrata and habitats in the area. The scorpions of the Massif and surrounding areas may be classified into seven ecomorphotypes, using every available niche. The species richness of the scorpion fauna is inversely correlated with altitude. The greatest diversity of genera and species occurs at the base of the Massif and in the surrounding areas, and decreases towards the summit. Five species occur in the area surrounding the Massif but not at its base, five at its base (below 500 m) but not on its slopes, two on its lower slopes (500–1000 m), but not on its middle slope (1000–1500 m), upper slope (1500–2000 m) or summit (above 2000 m), and two on its summit, upper and middle slopes only. Only five species occur from the base to the summit of the Massif.",

The family is, however, known to be widespread in Africa, with current records being South Africa (Western Cape, Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, Limpopo), Zimbabwe, Kenya and Nigeria. Natalimyzidae are mainly found in grassland, and in South Africa the family is most often collected during the dry, winter months in the eastern summer rainfall region. The larvae appear to be microflora grazers on decaying grass. Numerous additional new species of these small flies (approx. 2.5-4.5 mm long) await description ; a likely total of more than 30 species could be expected. The Natalimyzidae is the first widespread new family of Diptera described entirely from new African taxa. The relationships of Natalimyza with other schizophoran superfamilies are discussed, and the genus is referred to the Sciomyzoidea. A detailed review of all families of Sciomyzoidea suggests no definite sister group relationship with Natalimyza, and the new family is provisionally treated as incertae sedis within the superfamily.",

This group of pollinating flies is of particular interest to botanists and pollination biologists. This paper reviews its taxonomy and redescribes its species with the aid of new morphological and molecular data. Molecular evidence supports the group's monophyly, with two sister-clades, the \"aethiopica\" clade (= P. aethiopica) and the \"rondani\" clade (= P. elegans (Bigot), P. rondani (Bertoloni, P. rubiginosa Dias, and P. umbratipennis (Ricardo) stat. rev.). These clades correspond to two species groups defined by male morphology (\"aethiopica\" group = P. aethiopica and P. formosa (Austen); \"rondani\" group = P. elegans, P. rondani, P. rubiginosa, and P. umbratipennis stat. rev.). Molecular evidence also reveals a new character, the index of frons divergence, which is diagnostic for the two clades, and is thus a tool for separating previously indistinguishable females of P. aethiopica from P. rondani. Additionally, I show that some of the longest proboscid specimens, previously confused with P. rondani and P. aethiopica, are actually P. umbratipennis (Ricardo) stat. rev. P. rubiginosa, previously known only from Mozambique, is shown to occur in South Africa, and the male of this species is described for the first time. Furthermore, I show that the distribution of morphotypes within species with differing proboscis lengths is geographically structured, with long-proboscid species occurring only in the Albany Centre of Endemism.",

    "abstract": "Mormotomyia hirsuta Austen, 1936 is one of the most extraordinary and unusual looking Diptera and was placed by E.E. Austen into a family of its own, the Mormotomyiidae, upon its discovery in 1933. Adults superficially resemble small solifugids (sun spiders), having extremely long legs that are clothed, especially in males, in very long, closely-packed brown hair-like setae. The wings are reduced to dysfunctional straps, the halteres to small nodular processes, and the eyes are greatly reduced. M. hirsuta is cavernicolous in all life stages and guanobious at least in the larval stages. The phylogenetic position of the family has long been a subject of much speculation and disagreement. Until recently M. hirsuta had only been collected on two occasions: in May 1933 and December 1948, although there have been numerous unsuccessful rediscovery attempts. The species is apparently confined to the type locality and is, therefore, widely regarded as the “rarest fly in the world”. Here we report the rediscovery of adults, larvae and puparia at the type locality, a cave-like rock fissure at Ukasi Hill, Eastern Province, Kenya, in December 2010. This rediscovery has facilitated a more thorough examination and study of the immature stages using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This has revealed numerous microstructures not previously described by van Emden in 1950, and the larva and puparium are therefore re-described. An SEM study was conducted of the leg features of adults, specifically the form and structure of the tarsal claw and pulvillus, and these were compared to the same structures in examples of the true bat fly ectoparasitic families Nycteribiidae and Streblidae, and to the phoretic Mystacinobiidae. The basal sclerites of the wing are interpreted for the first time using SEM, the functional morphology of the larva, puparium and adult is discussed and notes are provided on the biology, development and cavernicolous habits of the species. The cuticular parts of the internal female reproductive tract are further described. They comprise a tubular vagina, two sclerotized spermathecae, paired accessory glands, and a small one-chambered sclerotized ventral receptacle. These are compared to species in the Mystacinobiidae, Sphaeroceroidea and Ephydroidea, and it is concluded that the structure of the female reproductive tract lends support to the inclusion of the Mormotomyiidae in the Ephydroidea.",

    "abstract": "This paper, the first on the Drosophilidae of Malawi, records 76 species from the northern, central and southern parts of the country. These species belong to 11 genera comprising 14 subgenera, and 26 species groups (including 29 species subgroups). Keys are provided for Amiota, Apenthecia, the Drosophila fima group, Liodrosophila and Mycodrosophila species from Malawi. Sixteen new species are descriptionbed: Amiota bandai, Apenthecia argyrea, A. obscura, Drosophila adamisa, D. brachytarsa, D. seyanii, D. curta, D. dimitroides, D. neomitra, D. seguyiana, Lissocephala bergi, L. kamundii, L. sosefi, Mycodrosophila dudleyi, M. nigrans, and Scaptodrosophila melaena. Five species are suspected to be new, but are left undescriptionbed because of lack of material. Five of the fifteen species from Nyika are new. Thus, in spite of extensive Brachystegia woodland - not much suitable to Drosophilidae - it appears that the Malawian fauna is unexpectedly speciose. Although Apenthecia capitata was not found in Malawi, we redescriptionbe it and include it in the key presented below; drawings are also given for Lissocephala ambigua, which was hitherto unfigured. New combination: Drosophila lucida SA©guy, 1938 = Liodrosophila lucida (SA©guy). Some montane species of the dentissima group have non-overlapping geographical ranges in Malawi, between the Nyika and Viphya Plateau. The Nyika highlands would have more connections with the Western Border Range to the northwest of Lake Tanganyika, while the Viphya highlands would have more affinities with southern mountain ranges. Drosophilidae of the Nyika Plateau reveal also Madagascan and oriental links, and provide some interesting indices supporting the antiquity of the evergreen forest on the plateau. Most notably, a new species of the robusta group, Drosophila seyanii, represents the first afrotropical record of this mainly oriental (but also holarctic) species group. A striking feature of the ecological relationships of African drosophilids is the consistency with which members of particular taxa (Mycodrosophila on fungus, Apenthecia on Aloe, Lissocephala on green figs, the Drosophila fima species group on red-black figs, or the Scaptodrosophila aterrima species group on Tubiflorales) use the same breeding substrate. Many such associations are documented in Malawi, and these are discussed.",

Yeates & Irwin (1996) concluded that the subfamilies Rhaphiomidinae and Megascelinae, both formerly placed within the Apioceridae, were separate basal lineages of the family Mydidae. The 28S rDNA evidence presented here confirms the sister group relationship of Tongamya and Megascelus, their retention in the subfamily Megascelinae, the removal of that subfamily from the Apioceridae and its placement within the family Mydidae. New material and field observations of flies belonging to the genus Tongamya enable us to expand the known range of Tongamya miranda, describe a second species, Tongamya stuckenbergi sp. n., better diagnose Tongamya and its two included species, and expand on the habitat and flight behaviour of this remarkable and rarely encountered genus of flies.",

A comparison is made between the vertical distribution of Mollusca in submerged weed beds in sheltered and exposed situations in Lake Sibaya.

Bulinus (Physopsis) globosus (intermediate host of S. haematobium and S. mattheei) did not extend beyond 1,4 m at which depth it was also most abundant. In the latter situation B. pfeifferi was found to 0,4 m and B.(Ph.)globosus to 0,3 m. The diversity of Mollusca in detached waterbodies adjacent to Lake Sibaya decreased with increasing distance from the present lake shore.

This severely restricts our understanding of the composition and distribution of the gastropod and bivalve communities in this region.

We here report on species obtained in the Eastern Congo in 2010. In total, 20 gastropod and bivalve taxa were collected from 24 freshwater habitats of the Nile and the Congo drainage system. By compiling faunal and taxonomic data we also aim to provide information of relevance to conservation efforts.",

    "abstract": "DNA barcoding was used to investigate laboratory and commercial stocks of Eisenia species from four provinces of South Africa. The COI gene was partially amplified and sequenced in selected earthworms from eight local populations (focal groups) and two European laboratory stocks (non-focal groups). Only nine COI haplotypes were identified from the 224 sequences generated. One of these haplotypes was found to belong to the megascolecid Perionyx excavatus. The remaining eight haplotypes belonged to the genus Eisenia, although only a single E. fetida haplotype, represented by six specimens, was found in one of the European populations. The other seven haplotypes, all occurring in South Africa, were E. andrei. One of the commercial stocks from South Africa and a laboratory culture from Europe were mixtures of E. andrei-P. excavatus and E. andrei-E. fetida, respectively. Previous allozyme studies have helped to suggest that some of the populations included in this study may be suffering from inbreeding depression, which could result in adverse consequences for both the vermiculture industry and ecotoxicological research in South Africa.",

The first three species fit into the Z. coquerelianum species-group, where Z. tigrioculatum seems to be closely related to Z. isalo Wesener, 2009 and Z. bilobum Wesener, 2009. Z. tigrioculatum is also the giant pill-millipede species currently known from the highest elevation, up 2000 m on Mt Andringitra. Z. muscorum and Z. darthvaderi were both collected in mossy forest at over 1000 m (albeit at distant localities), obviously a previously undersampled ecosystem. Z. darthvaderi and Z. heleios both possess very unusual characters, not permitting their placement in any existing species-group, putting them in an isolated position.

Its salinity tolerance varies in the range of 12–65 ‰, with the highest jellyfish concentrations often observed at hypersaline levels of 40–65 ‰. Considering that the species has persisted in the system under the present closed mouth conditions, it is suggested that it is capable of completing its life cycle within the estuarine lake.

A detailed description is provided along with habitus photographs, line drawings and SEM micrographs of relevant diagnostic characters. The new genus possesses the tribal synapomorphies of Megasternini but bears several unique morphological characters which are discussed in detail. The morphology of the remaining three species classified in the subgenus Acycreon d’Orchymont, 1942 (i.e. C. punctiger Knisch, 1921, C. collarti d’Orchymont, 1942 and C. apiciflavus Hebauer, 2002), is illustrated in order to provide evidence that Acycreon is an assemblage of morphologically dissimilar and likely not related species. An identification key to the Megasternini genera and subgenera known from the Republic of South Africa is presented.",

This work represents an updated analysis and interpretation of the fossil based on character comparison and phylogenetic analysis. The new genus and species, Ceafornotensis archratiras, are described in Melolonthinaeincertae sedis. Phylogenetic analysis suggests a sister group relationship with the tribe Phaenognathini (Melolonthinaeincertae sedis). Although phytophagy in the adult beetle cannot be confirmed, it is proposed that angiosperms could have contributed to a proportion of its diet (larval or adult). This beetle may belong to a stem lineage of pleurostict scarabaeids which later experienced major radiation in response to widespread environmental changes brought about by continuing radiation of the angiosperms.",

The S. inornatus group consists of three large species with restricted ranges, S. guentheri and S. bourquilli sp. n. with small hindlimb buds from Durban and the Natal Midlands respectively, and the limbless S. inornatus from the Durban area. The three species of the S. arenicola group have only three supraoculars and are restricted to coastal alluvium. S. vestigifer sp. n. retains vestigial hindlimb buds and has a relict distribution on the southern margin of the range of S. arenicola. S. insularis inhabits the Bazaruto Archipelago.",

    "abstract": "Scanning and transmission electron microscopic investigations of the maxillipedes of adult centipedes and the first anamorphic larval stage of Lithobiomorpha show the presence of sensilla coeloconica on the surface of the poison claw. In maxillipedes of larval stages only a single type of sensillum is present. In the adult centipedes three types of sensilla coeloconica were observed : (I) thick conical sensilla, (II) thin slender sensilla, and (III) long and tapered sensilla. The distribution of these types on the surface of the poison claw of the maxillipede is shown. Each sensillum coeloconicum consists of a short peg in a round or oval cuticular pit. A terminal pore on the tip of each peg suggests that all these sensilla coeloconica have a chemoreceptive function. Tubular bodies in the type II sensilla of Lithobius forficatus (Linnaeus, 1758) point to a mechanoreceptive function which means that the thin sensilla coeloconica may function as contact chemoreceptors. The two different types of dendritic outer segments in the type I sensilla of Necrophloeophagus longicornis (Leach, 1815) and L. forficatus point to a double function, perhaps to hygro- or thermoreception. The phylogenetic significance of the presence of three types of sensilla coeloconica in the five orders of centipedes is discussed.",

Previous checklists of polyxenid genera have been provided in several books, but these works were devoted to genus and family group-names, including the types of all published names. A new, comprehensive and updated checklist of Penicillata species is proposed as the catalogue for a relational database and taxonomic system of reference for the Penicillata of the world. This review of the currently known world Penicillata comprises 159 valid species and / or subspecies, including one parthenogenetic form, and seven fossil taxa documented from amber. They belong to four accepted families: Hypogexenidae (1 genus), Lophoproctidae (5 genera), Polyxenidae (19 genera), and Synxenidae (1 genus). Three taxa remain incertae sedis. The checklist is documented at the family, genus and species level, and taxa are listed alphabetically. The type-genus of each family and typespecies of each genus are preceded by a bold asterisk. Main synonymies or particular observations are detailed for each valid taxa. The checklist is valid up to May 2003. Penicillata Mundi is a also a relational database maintained at the MNHN (Paris), which aims to provide a tool for monitoring and mapping the biodiversity of Penicillata. In future, the list will be published on a CIM-webpage and then progressively updated.

Three new species - kaltenbachi, microcephala and starmuhlneri - are descriptionbed in Austrocurupira Dumbleton, a taxon originally designated a subgenus of Neocurupira Lamb and now elevated to generic status. A new subgenus, Curupirina, is erected for these three species. A fourth new species, the type of a new genus, is named Nesocurupira curtirostris; it is remarkable for the extreme reduction of its mouthparts. These four species belong in the Apistomyinae. A fifth species is represented by a single larva very different from those of the other species; its affinities cannot be ascertained, but it may belong to the Paltostominae. The relationships of the New Caledonia blepharocerids reflect the position and isolation of the island. The distinctive kaltenbachi group of species is related to Austrocurupira nicholsoni (Tillyard) of Australia, and the strongly apomorph Nesocurupira curtirostris may be related to Nothohoraia Craig of New Zealand.",

The larvae lack a functional circumanal ring and do not produce wax, a feature unusual for psyllids. The lack of wax deprives them of the protection common in various free-living psyllids.

In contrast to all previously described physoderine species, the new species is apterous, which is probably a result of neoteny; the neotenous aptery and its morphological consequences are discussed. The diagnosis of Physoderinae is extended in order to make it applicable to apterous taxa. In all examined specimens including larvae, the body surface is covered by a firm incrustation of soil, deposited between the long setigerous tubercles. This is the first record in the subfamily Physoderinae of camouflaging by application of material on the body, and the first report of such behaviour in the adult stage in Reduviidae.",

(Madagascar); (3) No. microtheres sp. n. (Madagascar); (4) No. miltothorax sp. n. (Madagascar); (5) No. rufitibia (Oldroyd, 1960) comb. n. (Madagascar); (6) No. stuckenbergi (Oldroyd, 1960) comb. n. (Madagascar). The species are well illustrated and a key for their separation is provided along with distribution maps.Ericomyia gen. n. is described and illustrated based on Madagascan material previously assigned to Laphria atomentosa Oldroyd, 1960.The considerable variation in size of No. coerulescens specimens and the species' wide distribution, presently involving five Indian Ocean islands and a number of African countries, is discussed. It is suggested that oceanic currents are responsible for the distribution, while deforestation may have resulted in a decreased size of individuals.",

The monophyly of Scrapter is not supported by unambiguous apomorphies, but is defensible by the congruence of various qualitative characters (e.g. premental fovea, hindleg and sternal scopa in female, T2 fovea, two submarginal cells).\nThe new species are : Scrapter pruinosus Davies, sp. n. (both sexes), S. pyretus Davies, sp. n. (both sexes) and S. viciniger Davies, sp. n. (male only). The taxonomic status of five species described by Cockerell in 1944, and subsequently overlooked, is addressed. They are all found to be synonyms of other Scrapter species, except one, which is found to be a Ctenoplectrina species (Apidae : Apinae : Ctenoplectrini). The new synonymies are: S. subincertus Cockerell (= S. niger Lepeletier de Saint-Fargeau & Audinet-Serville), S. brunneipennis Cockerell (= S. niger); S. merescens Cockerell (= S. leonis Cockerell); S. sinophilus Cockerell (= S. algoensis (Friese)).

Two main morphotypes were identified in the set: the nominate form eberti, and the one comprising specimens with a red patch, form rubromaculata. However, both forms had similar genitalic structures and shared some specific wing marks, in addition to displaying the same COI (i.e., barcode region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene) haplotype, strongly suggesting that the two morphologically distinct forms belong to the same species, E. eberti .

While most populations of M. alberti conform to the typical black morph of the species, a red morph is also reported here, providing the first case of colour polymorphism in an Afrotropical ant-like castianeirine spider. Spiders were collected by hand, and ants by pitfall trapping in the Ndumo Game Reserve in northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, to identify the potential models of the two colour morphs of M alberti. The ants collected at 20 sites in the reserve suggest that the black morph is a generalised mimic of black ground-dwelling ants, most likely Camponotus cinctellus (Gerstäcker, 1859), Streblognathus peetersi Robertson, 2002 and Polyrhachis gagates F. Smith, 1858, while the red morph is a mimic of Anoplolepis custodiens (F. Smith, 1858) ants.",

Centipedes were extracted from soil samples and trapped by pitfall traps.\nIn the first year, densities, epigeic activity and numbers of species were low. Over the study period, endogeic densities of centipedes increased significantly at all sites, and the number of species was highest in the fourth year. Dominant species were Lithobius mutabilis, Lithobius forficatus, Geophilus flavus, Schendyla nemorensis and Strigamia acuminata. Three uncommon species appeared in the last year : Lithobius austriacus, Strigamia crassipes and Geophilus electricus.

This multicellular complex gland is located at the dorsal side of the maxillary organ and is therefore called the 'maxillary organ gland'. This gland is composed of numerous secretory units, each of which is made up of four different cell types : Two secretory cells are attached to a single intermediary cell that mediates between the secretory cells and two different canal cells (a proximal and a distal canal cell). The distal canal cell passes through the cuticle. The cuticular wall of the whole gland enclose a large secretion reservoir. A common cuticular duct drains the secretion into the maxillary organ. Similar complex epidermal glands are hitherto not described in Chilopoda. \nThe function of the maxillary organ gland in relation to the maxillary organ is discussed. The secretions of the maxillary organ gland support the function of the maxillary organ as a cleaning organ. The secretion of this gland is assumed to spread over the trichoma of the maxillary organ by capillary forces. Legs and antennae that pass along the trichoma will be moistened by the secretory material of the gland. Additionally, the secretion of the gland may contain antibacterial or antifungal substances to protect the numerous annulations of the antennal flagellum and the tarsal articles.",

This taxon, which was described from a unique intermediate valve from South Africa, is re-evaluated and recognized as a valid species, differing from C. crosslandi in several significant characters. We also present an unusual feature detected in almost all the specimens of Cryptoplax dupuisi Ashby, 1931, which are characterized by the absence of dorsal girdle spicules on the first four valves, a feature never reported in other chiton species.

However, we have established that current use of the name is inconsistent with both the original description and first figure of the species. The name-bearing type is lost, and purported paratypes in the Museum für Naturkunde der Humboldt-Universität, Berlin, on which Connolly's widely-followed redescription was based, are not authentic. They have no type status and are instead specimens of Gulella albersi (Pfeiffer, 1855). Recently collected specimens conforming to Pfeiffer's description and figure of G. menkeana have been identified and a neotype is designated. This material also corresponds with the current broad interpretation of G. adamsiana (Pfeiffer, 1859), which, with its several established synonyms, we include in the synonymy of G. menkeana. There is also considerable resemblance to G. wahlbergi (Krauss, 1848), a name based on composite material and for which the lectotype is lost. We also designate a neotype for this species so as to preserve current application of the name. The possible synonymy of G. menkeana and G. wahlbergi, an older name, is of nomenclatural concern, but is not critical to the issue of defining Gulella s.s.",

    "abstract": "The issue investigated was whether a distinction can be made between centipede communities from different development phases of an unevenly-aged beech forest stand. The influence of stand structure on centipede diversity, resulting from a particular forest management practice, was evaluated. Soil samples were taken three times during 2000 from a beech stand with patches of different development phases near Ljubljana in Slovenia. Using the quadrat counts method, soil samples were taken with a sampling corer from adjoining selected patches in understorey re-initiation (gap-patch), juvenile, pole and timber phases of a forest. The characteristics of centipede communities and the similarities between them were then estimated by use of statistical methods (Jackknife estimate of species richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Pielou's index of evenness, index of dominance, Renkonen index). The collection comprised 2075 centipedes representing 36 species. In a single patch, 24-28 species were found. Average centipede density was between 109 and 892 individuals per square metre. None of the common species was found exclusively in one development phase. The responses to forest development phases differed among species. Some species were considerably more abundant in older forest development phases, but most species did not show preference for a certain development phase. Differences between patches lay mostly in the distribution and abundance of species. Some samples from different patches are more similar than seasonal samples taken from the same patch. It was discovered that the centipede community structure in patches of an unevenly aged stand does not only depend on a forest development phase. The inference was made that centipedes migrate between patches with different environmental conditions. Such an unevenly-aged stand can offer favourable conditions for more centipede species, so it was predicted that both alpha diversity and density are higher than they would be in an evenly-aged stand in the same area. Since small-scale heterogeneity within a forest stand enhances local species richness and supports viable populations of specialised species, maintenance of this heterogeneity should be the key focus in management operations within a forest stand.",

The most abundant species was Lithobius calcaratus. By applying a combination of the criteria dominance, constancy and representativity, 'characteristic species' and 'companion species' were defined. For seven of the 20 recorded centipede species, it was possible to delineate biotope-characteristic assemblages. Mesoxeric meadows are characterised by L. calcaratus and L. forficatus, mesoxeric meadows with shrub and pioneer forest (advanced succession sites) by L. crassipes, L. mutabilis and L. forficatus and Schendyla nemorensis. In grassland contaminated by heavy metals, a typical group consisting of L. melanops and L. forficatus with Cryptops parisi was found. Dwarf-shrub heaths (L. calcaratus) and sandy xeric-meadows (Lamyctes emarginatus and Lithobius e. erythrocephalus) were only characterised by companion species. The results show that some centipede species and characteristic species assemblages are very good indicators for minor habitat differences.",

A new species, Sergentomyia (Sintonius) hriani n.sp•• is described and figured, and a description with figures is given of a species of Sergenlolllyia represented by males only and not determinable. Records are given for Sergentomyia sqllIJmipleur;s (Newstead) and S. bedjordi Newstead). The sand-flies on which this study is based have been collected by Mr. B. R. Stucken­ berg of the Natal Museum, to whom I am grateful for the opportunity of examining them. Specimens are described below according to the system used by Lewis (1957). When anterior 'vertical' teeth are present in the cibarium, they are designated 'fore teeth' in distinction from the 'hind' 'horizontal' teeth normally present in Sergentomyia. The length oC one ascoid on antennal segment 4 was measured along an axis parallel to the segment. The length of palpal segments I + 2 was measured from the junction of segment I with the maxilla. Schmidt and Schmidt (1963) suggested that, for calculating palpal ratios, the length of each segment should be expressed to three decimal places. In the present work three places were used for several ratios used in calculating averages. With regard to wing veins, RI apex is to be regarded as positive unless indicated as negative in the ratio of RI apex to R 2• The 'knob' of the spermatheca (Fairchild and Hertig, 1951; Theodor, 1965) is the part into which the hair-like gland-ducts lead.",

    "abstract": "The colonial explorer image was about exploration and conquering exotic lands. Specimens of everything that was encountered were collected and often later donated or sold to museums. This approach became unpopular because it encouraged overcollecting of natural areas to make money selling specimens to museums. The reason for collections and collecting needed re-inventing, and a resource / conservation / heritage approach was adopted. There are problems with the heritage approach as it is primarily static when collections need to grow. The modern trend in museums is to collect only voucher specimens or specimens that fill taxonomic gaps in collections (Oberholzer 1988). This is to protect local biodiversity and is also often because of space and human capacity constraints in museums caused by lack of sufficient funding for taxonomic research; the latter is evident over the last decades on the national (Herbert 2001; Smith et al. 2008), as well as on the global scale (e.g., Boero 2010; Pyke & Ehrlich 2010). There has also been a tendency for South African museums to specialise in certain groups, rather than to curate specimens from all orders. Although this makes sense in the light of space and capacity limits, it creates the real possibility that certain areas of the country will be undersampled because a museum that collects a particular order lies in another part of the country. There are thus reasons to revisit this approach to museum collections.",

The emergence of R. mopani coincides with the dry winter period in South Africa, when other trees are leafless. The nymphal stages secrete a scutcheon-like protective covering called lerp. The position of lerps on the leaflets depended on the stage of development of the nymphs. First and second instar nymph lerps were placed along the smaller secondary veins, whereas third, fourth and fifth instars placed their lerps along the main veins on either surface of the leaflet. Nymphs were more common on the adaxial surface than on the abaxial surface of the leaves, suggesting that the lerp offers some form of protection against predators and desiccation. Nymphs do not co-habit the same lerp. Visible damage caused by nymphs and lerps on the host plant includes discolouration of leaflets around feeding sites and occasional curled leaflets.",

Using Physa acuta as a model, this musculature was shown to be anatomically complex and associated in places with the columellar muscle. The physid musculature has two main components, the physid muscle sensu stricto and the fan muscle, both of which have previously been named but not examined in detail. The physid muscle s.s. is branched with the larger branches running to the neck, head and foot, and the smaller ones to the lung floor and mantle. The fan muscle is not branched. We propose that the physid musculature is responsible for a unique ability of physids to rapidly flick their shells from side to side—a reaction that frequently enables them to escape predation. We suggest that during this movement the lung floor, which is strengthened by several bands of muscle from both the physid musculature and the columellar muscle, serves as a pivot for the rotating visceral hump and shell, while the main trunk of the physid muscle s.s. and its main branches provide a broad anchorage in the foot.",

Eggs were deposited mostly on the abaxial surface and most eggs (76%) were found along veins. Contrary to the literature, eggs were not attached to the leaflet surface by a pedicel but were glued to the surface. Eggs were laid mostly in clusters and were often camouflaged by black fungal spots that were common on the leaflets.

Hickman pointed out in this paper that the spider possessed characters found in several widely separated families but could not be placed satisfactorily in anyone of them. Up till now the family Toxopidae has remained based on this single species. In the present paper four further genera and twenty-six species are brought into the family and the majority of the family characteristics suggested by Hickman are confirmed. Three of the genera, Cycloctenus, Plectophanes and Laestrygones, have been known for many years but because of their anomalous characters have been placed in an extraordinary range of families. Cycloctenus L. Koch (1878) was originally placed by Koch in the Ctenidae, but subsequent authors have considered the genus better situated in the Lycosidae. Plectophanes Bryant (1935) was originally descriptionbed as a genus in the Sicariidae. Laestrygones Urquhart (1893) was placed by Urquhart in the Oxyopidae although he descriptionbed the same species subsequently (Urquhart, 1885) as a species of Lycosa. The presence of an unusual spined plate in front of the spinnerets of this species led Hogg (1909) to consider the spider cribellate and he descriptionbed it as a new species of Stiphidion Simon (1902), a genus belonging to the family Psechridae. The present author (Forster, 1955), revising Hogg's species, realised that the spider was not cribellate, and also that it should be placed in Laestrygones, but followed Bryant (1933) in placing the genus in the family Perissoblemmidae.",

    "abstract": "The first overview of the jumping spiders (Araneae: Salticidae) of Lesotho is presented. Twenty-eight species are recorded for the first time, to add to three recently described species of Euophryinae. Among these, six species are described as new to science: Belippo attenuata sp. n., Dendryphantes acutus sp. n., Heliophanus furvus sp. n., H. maluti sp. n., H. transversus sp. n. and Massagris mohale sp. n., all known from both sexes. The Lesotho fauna shows considerable overlap with the grassland fauna of the adjacent Free State Province of South Africa (15 of 31 species), indicating the importance of vegetation in shaping salti­cid assemblages, but highlighting the role of the considerable differences in altitude and geology in the two areas.

The general behaviour of this species is revealed to be comparable to that of other theraphosids, with field and captive observations establishing that they are a generalist and opportunistic species. The defensive behaviour of the species is determined to be based primarily on the avoidance of conflict situations, with overt aggressive behaviour seldom displayed. Although the opportunistic existence that this species has developed is probably obligatory due to their sedentary lifestyle and limited availability of resources, this behaviour nonetheless allows the species to occupy diverse habitats and exploit niches unavailable to more specialized species.",

    "abstract": "The hermatypic coral fauna of the Western Indian Ocean is one of the least known globally. This is true of the East African Coast and especially Mozambique, where taxonomic studies are scarce and date mostly from decades ago. The morphology of coral species is subjected to a high level of geographical and environmental variability, which leads to difficulties in field identification and may limit the level of taxonomic resolution at which coral studies can be conducted. Thorough examination of collected specimens can provide more reliable identification of species and more importantly provide a physical record that can be studied further. We collected and identified 32 species of corals from the genus Acropora (Anthozoa: Scleractinia: Acroporidae) of Vamizi Island, northern Mozambique, and present an annotated and illustrated checklist of species. These species records illustrate the high diversity of Acropora in Vamizi, which is comparable to the diversity of this genus in the region. This study can help assess the biodiversity of the region and provides a baseline against which changes can be closely monitored.",

Recent collecting in South Africa, and taxonomic revisions, have provided new insights facilitating a biogeographical study. The family is widely distributed within the subregion, and at altitudes up to 1600 m. The distribution of Harpagophora and Zinophora is non-overlapping and is strongly linked to rainfall seasonality and biome, with Harpagophora being confined to winter rainfall, and to Succulent Karoo and Fynbos biomes, while Zinophora mainly occurs in the summer rainfall Savannah and Grassland biomes, with a few species in Thicket and Nama Karoo. Both of these genera can be divided into distinct species-groups based on gonopod morphology, and these groupings also have a clear geographic basis. The distribution of individual species appears to be linked to biomes, and more widespread species occur in extensive biomes such as Savannah. Barriers which have isolated or separated genera, species-groups, and individual species, are difficult to determine, but rivers and altitude may be important factors limiting distribution and promoting vicariance.",

The remaining specimens were passed to me for study, prior to donation to the Museum. A survey of the beds in April and October 2006 yielded another 28 specimens, as well as numerous examples of insect-plant interactions in a form of damages to Pentoxylon australica.",

We characterised three eras of bee taxonomy. The highest rate of species description per annum occurred during the first half of the 20 th Century, before generic revisions were prevalent, and when the focus was on consolidating knowledge and developing identification keys. We also researched the locations of type specimens, which included all primary types and syntypes. Most types are housed in western Europe. We describe the Catalogue of Afrotropical Bees (CAB), a biodiversity information system and related GBIF checklist that is the system’s standardised, published output.

    "abstract": "Bivalves play a vital role in estuarine ecosystems, but are vulnerable to rapid or prolonged changes in the physico-chemical environment. The St Lucia estuarine lake exhibits sub-decadal changes from wet to dry periods, resulting in fluctuating physico-chemical conditions. This paper represents a census of the diversity of bivalve molluscs in this estuary, emphasising changes associated with climate-induced hydrological states. Twenty-four bivalve species were recorded within St Lucia between 1925 and 2011. Twelve that had not been reported previously from St Lucia in the literature were encountered during the present study. These are Anadara natalensis, Anomia achaeus, Arcuatula capensis, Chambardia wahlbergi, Corbicula fluminalis, Dendostrea sandvichensis, Fulvia fragilis, Mactra cuneata, Martesia striata, Meretrix meretrix, Saccostrea forskahlii and Tellina s.l. bertini. Single shells of another two previously unrecorded species, Anodontia edentula and Timoclea lavrani, were also found, although these may have been introduced dead from the ocean through tidal exchange. Meretrix meretrix, an unexpected yet abundant species, represents a new record for South African waters, but the timing and mode of its introduction into the estuary remain unresolved. Extremely large numbers (>100 ind.m-2)of dead specimens of Barnea manilensis were observed in 2011 along the western shoreline of the estuarine lake, which indicates that the species was a major role-player in the settling of suspended silt within the system. Currently, this function appears to be fulfilled only by Solen cylindraceus. Apart from this species, Brachidontes virgiliae, Dosinia hepatica, Macomopsis moluccensis, Salmacoma litoralis and an undescribed Tellina sp. (reported here as T. cf. rousi) are the only bivalves that were found alive in St Lucia during the latest survey, in March 2011.",

A key to these species is presented, and lindneri is redescriptionbed on all available material. The first-instar larva of lindneri is descriptionbed and compared to those known for Ctenostylidae and Pyrgotidae; both Afrotropical species of Ramuliseta appear to be larviparous. The first-instar of lindneri differs markedly from that of Pyrgotidae in having well-developed mouthhooks and nine anteroventral bands of short spinules. No males of Lindneri are known, and it is suggested that this species and congeners may reproduce parthenogenetically.",

    "abstract": "The significance of the Gariep Centre of Endemicity is noted; this region includes the Richtersveld south of the Orange River in north-western South Africa and the adjacent parts of southern Namibia, where a rich succulent flora exists. A small but distinctive fauna of vennileonid flies is endemic in the Gariep. The new species and member of the Gariep fauna, Leptynoma (Leptynoma) kirkspriggsi sp. n., is descriptionbed from southern Namibia. New records are given of vermileonid species in western South Africa. Cladistic analysis of Leptynoma Westwood s. str. reveals a basal dichotomy, with L. sericea Westwood as sister-species of the other four which form a stepwise clade, with L. appendiculata (Bezzi) basal to L. hessei (Stuckenberg), L. namaquaensis (Stuckenberg) and L. kirkspriggsi sp. n. The two older species (sericea and appendiculata) inhabit the Fynbos Biome, whereas the three younger species occur in the Succulent Karoo Biome. The distribution of Leptynoma s. str. is mapped and its biogeography discussed. Cladogenesis accords with botanical evidence that Fynbos is the older biome and Succulent Karoo a younger biome with many fynbos affinities. It is proposed that the constraints limiting the distribution of these vermileonids relate to selective anthophily and nectarivory, for which the flies show strong morphological adaptations. Studies by other workers are cited, of guild associations between fynbos plant taxa and large species of Nemestrinidae and Tabanidae with an extremely long proboscis. Several striking examples are cited of mouthpart elongation for nectarivory in fynbos representatives of other, unrelated families of Diptera. Less extreme cases of labial elongation often occur among fynbos flies. Cladogenesis in the Succulent Karoo would have been coeval with the evolution of that biome in response to extreme summer aridity which began to develop in the Pliocene.",

Glomeris connexa and Polydesmus complanatus are dominant species in most types of forest. The mean number of species trapped per study site increase with increasing humidity and fertility of the habitat; a positive effect of these two factors for an increase of mean of individuals trapped per study site was also found. The species diversity and the evenness of community structure rose with increasing fertility in moist, wet and swampy forest. They also increased with increasing humidity, but in coniferous forests only. The diplopod communities were similar in species composition but they differed in dominance structure depending on site humidity and fertility. Three main types of community were distinguished : communities of very humid forests with extreme (low and high) fertilities, communities of average humid forests with low fertilities, and communities of average humid forests with higher fertilities.",

    "abstract": "Published studies of mouthparts of adult Blephariceridae have assumed that the labial morphology accords with that of other Diptera, especially that the stem of the labium is constituted by the prementum (theca). The present study shows this assumption to be incorrect : the prementum in this family is present only as a reduced basal component of the labium, and the labial stem is formed by the basal labial palp segments. In the tribes Paltostomatini and Apistomyiini the basal labial palp segments are joined longitudinally and form the main part of the labial stem, with a dorsal channel on the anterior aspect in which the syntrophium reposes, equivalent to the labial gutter normally constituted only by the prementum in other Diptera. Apistomyiini are apomorphically characterised by elongation of the apical labial palp segments into slender tubular forms supported internally by pseudotrachea-like sclerotisations. Monophyly of Paltostomatini is demonstrated by the presence of a small, setose lobe at the base of the inner face of each apical labial palp segment. Fusion of the basal labial palp segments to form the labial stem is a synapomorphy indicating a sister-group relationship between Paltostomatini and Apistomyiini. Evolution of the colocephalous head form in these two tribes is discussed. The condition appears to be associated with obligate autogeny ; its adaptive significance may be an advantage gained of abbreviated life of the female flies, which could enhance reproductive success.",

The following new species are described: albipunctata, cod, frontalis, fuscipennis, minor, pallipes, philippinensis, and sflIckenbergi. The genus is known only from tropical Africa and Asia. The apparently myrmecophilous habits seem to have caused the flies to undergo several structural modifications. The genus Rhynchopsilopa Hendel is one of the more interesting in the ephydrid subfamily Psilopinae because the adults have undergone several curious structural modi­ fications that partially obscure their true relationships, for example, the long pendant an­ tennae borne on an elevation at the anterior end of the shortened frons, the depressed face with a sharp epistoma, the long proboscis and modified palpi, and the convex, bril­ liantly shining thorax and abdomen. These modifications are probably related to the habits of the flies, which are reportedly myrmecophilous. Students of ant behaviour are urged to watch for these active, metallic-coloured flies and to determine what relationship exists between them and the ants they follow. After studying a large accumulation of recently collected specimens, I am taking this opportunity to review the six known species of the genus, to add descriptions of eight new species, and to give a key for their separation. The genus is known to occur only in tropical Africa and Asia. I am greatly indebted to the following persons for the opportunity to study material in their respective museums and collections: P.

    "abstract": "Material collected between 2017 and 2019 in Ethiopia in the Awash River catchment substantially increased our knowledge of Labiobaetis Novikova &amp;amp; Kluge in this country. Four species were previously reported based on ecological investigations of Ethiopian rivers: L. glaucus (Agnew, 1961), L. latus (Agnew, 1961), L. vinosus (Barnard, 1932) and L. bellus (Barnard, 1932). We have identified six different species using a combination of morphology and genetic distance (COI, Kimura 2-parameter). Two of them, L. alahmadii Gattolliat &amp;amp; Al Dhafer, 2018 and L. potamoticus Gattolliat &amp;amp; Al Dhafer, 2018 were previously assumed to be endemic to the Arabian Peninsula. The status of L. bellus is discussed and remains unresolved. One species is new to science; it is described and illustrated based on its nymphs. A key to the nymphs of all Ethiopian species is provided. The interspecific K2P distances in Ethiopia are between 17% and 23%, the intraspecific distances are usually between 0% and 1%. The total number of Labiobaetis species worldwide is augmented to 145. The Afrotropical species of Labiobaetis are discussed in comparison to the species of other realms.",

    "abstract": "The nineteenth century was an era of international rivalry in the establishment of great showpiece museums, whose size, palatial appearance, growing collections and reputation for research were sources of national pride. Such iconic museums had resources and funding enabling them to despatch collecting expeditions abroad, often taking advantage of expanding control and development of large colonial territories in the tropics. This enthusiasm for natural history and museums was brought to South Africa by successive groups of British settlers. The first museum was established in Cape Town in 1825, and later officially instituted as the South African Museum. Remarkably quickly, under the influence of the 1820 Settlers who became established around Algoa Bay and in the adjacent countryside, museums were formed in the communities of Grahamstown (1855), Port Elizabeth (1856) and King William's Town (1884). In colonial Natal, a museum was considered to be desirable as early as 1854, and was initiated in 1879 by some members of the literary society in the young city of Pietermaritzburg. In Durban also, a municipal museum was set up, and its first director, Mr John Quekett, was appointed in 1895. As Pietermaritzburg had the status of administrative capital of the Natal Colony, the original Natal Society museum was eventually taken over to become the nucleus of the official Natal Government Museum in 1903. Museums with similar official status also appeared in the Transvaal and Orange Free State Republics.",

We introduce data on aspects of the soft anatomy in the hope that these groupings may be tested when other taxa are investigated more thoroughly.",

Two samples of foliose lichen collected in 2010 contained nine tardigrade specimens and one egg belonging to five genera and seven species: Echiniscuscf.quadrispinosus, Milnesium sp., Milnesiumcf.bohleberi, Hypsibiuscf.convergens, Ramazzottius sp., Macrobiotuscf.pallarii and Minibiotusharrylewisi. Milnesium sp. resembles Milnesiumlagniappe , a species from southeastern USA, in its cuticle, and possibly in the number of peribuccal lamellae. Specimens from Lesotho and South Africa previously identified as Milnesiumtardigradum are in fact Milnesiumcf.bohleberi. The habitus of Ramazzottius sp. is consistent with R.theroni , a southern African species, but due to the condition of the specimen the presence of cuticular sculpture cannot be definitively ruled out. Macrobiotuscf.pallarii differs from M.pallarii sensu stricto in some structural details of the egg processes. This is the first record of Minibiotusharrylewisi outside of its type location in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.",

    "abstract": "Public understanding of the goals of applied biology and conservation is promoted by showcasing charismatic or significant organisms using vernacular names. Conservation activities in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, are prioritising taxa that have high rates of provincial endemism, such as snails, earthworms, millipedes and cicadas. To assist wider public engagement in these activities, an assessment of endemism of the cicadas of KwaZulu-Natal is presented along with a dichotomous, 37-couplet key for the identification of males, based mainly on externally visible morphology and colouration. Standardised English vernacular names coined following a simple naming convention are proposed. Forty-two percent (16 out of 38) of the cicada species known from KwaZulu-Natal are endemic to the province. Photographs of some of the species are included to facilitate their identification. Photographs can be used for identification of various species providing that the diagnostic characters are visible in the photographs. For this purpose, photographs may have to be taken of hand-held individuals. Some of the endemic species are of particular concern for conservation because they are not known to occur in statutory protected areas or are only known from relatively small protected areas. The latter may not be able to ensure the long-term survival of the species. The rate and extent of loss of habitat outside protected areas is likely to be a grave threat to species that are not protected or that are inadequately conserved in statutory protected areas. The standardised vernacular names proposed here provide a tool for communicating provincial conservation plans and concerns with stakeholders in KwaZulu-Natal and for stimulating interest in cicadas amongst land users, environmental impact assessment practitioners, biologists, naturalists and citizen scientists.",

The use of molecular DNA technology, such as the use of conserved regions in mtDNA and nuclear DNA has unravelled the phylogenetic background of several earthworm species. The current study utilised the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) mitochondrial marker to reconstruct the phylogeny of Kazimierzus Plisko, 2006 species from the Western and Northern Cape provinces of South Africa. Phylogenetic reconstructions were implemented using Bayesian Inference, as well as Maximum Likelihood. Both tree building methods adhered to the monophyly of the majority of the taxa. Results showed that species fell into two clades and validated eleven currently known Kazimierzus species ( K. circulatus (Plisko, 1998), K. franciscus (Pickford, 1975), K. guntheri (Pickford, 1975), K. hamerae (Plisko, 1998), K. kleinoodi Nxele &amp;amp; Plisko, 2017, K. nietvoorbiji Nxele &amp;amp; Plisko, 2017, K. nieuwoudtvillensis Nxele &amp;amp; Plisko, 2017, K. occidualis (Plisko, 1998), K. pearsonianus (Pickford, 1975), K. phumlani Nxele &amp;amp; Plisko, 2017, K. sophieae (Plisko, 2002)). Cryptic diversity is evident in K. occidualis with genetic divergence greater than 12% amongst populations. Kazimierzus franciscus and K. ljungstroemi (Pickford, 1975) have a low genetic variability suggesting close relatedness or probably conspecificity. A group of specimens from Clanwilliam are morphologically identical to K. sophieae , but are genetically distinct and may belong to undescribed species. This study demonstrates the importance of integrative taxonomy in earthworms in order to present reliable taxonomic and biogeographic data.",

The species of Isomerocera are re-examined, based on 524 specimens (including four types) from 15 institutions, and two species were distinguished. The rare species I. heteraspis James, 1949 is characterised by some unusual autapomorphic characters. The common I. quadrilineata varies remarkably in colour characters, and the extent and density of hair patches. Isomerocera maculiventris (Macquart, 1850) is considered to be a junior synonym of I. quadrilineata (Fabricius, 1787) as is I. natalensis (Gerstaecker, 1857). Isomerocera quadrilineata var. melecta, as originally described by Speiser (1908), is identical with the nominal form. Generic characters are compared with the related genus Ptilocera from the Oriental and Australasian regions. Distribution data are summarised on the basis of the reliable published records and/or extensive material that we examined and collected in Angola, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo (Kinshasa), Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Republic of the Congo (Brazzaville), Sierra Leone, South Africa, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda and Zimbabwe. I. heteraspis is known only from two localities in Burundi and Uganda. The known distribution of I. quadrilineata essentially covers the vast area of savannahs and the zone of lowland tropical moist broadleaf forests in Africa.",

In the absence of sufficient mollusc-prey, however, the fly larvae show alternative predation at the expense of the freshwater snail Aulophorus furcatus.

The previously known species Arge mirabilipes Pasteels, 1955, A. tibialis Pasteels, 1963 and A. intermedia Pasteels, 1963 from South Africa, are redescribed. Two additional species from Namibia and Kenya are described: Arge kungveldensis sp. n. and A. taitaensis sp. n. The species of this group are characterized by the medially slightly widened hind tibia, a very short hind basitarsomere, and the sawsheath is broadly and obtusely pincer-shaped apically. According to these characters, Arge tibialis (= A. bisignata Konow, 1907) and A. intermedia are removed from this group. A. tibialis is synonymised under A. bisignata. A key to the three valid species is provided. The genitalia of all species are illustrated, and geographic distribution and taxonomic relationships are discussed.",

Six of the seven species described by Tsacas are endemic to Madagascar; unpublished records indicate, however, that C. pauliani, occurs in Namibia and South Africa on the African continental mainland. Six additional endemic species are described as new: C. coronaeformis sp. n., C. gladiiformis sp. n., C. griveaudi sp. n., C. irwini sp. n., C. parkeri sp. n., and C. rinhatinana sp. n. The head and thorax, frons, wing, sixth sternite and hypandrium of the male of the 13 species are illustrated for the first time, as well as the highly diagnostic male phallus, both laterally and dorsally at the junction of the basiphallus and distiphallus. A key to species based on male characters is provided, and species distributions are mapped and interpreted. The biogeographical significance of the Madagascan species is discussed.

    "abstract": "This paper presents the results of investigations conducted between 2011 and 2013 to discover additional populations of Mormotomyia hirsuta Austen. These investigations were conducted primarily in the relatively dry savanna of eastern Kenya, focusing on small hills and rocky outcrops resembling that of Ukasi Hill, the type locality of the “terrible hairy fly”. Investigations were conducted at 144 caves and at ground level, directly below 104 above-ground, narrow, horizontally-oriented fissures, often on near-vertical rock faces. Evidence of Mormotomyia was not found in any of the caves investigated. During the dry season, however, desiccated corpses of Mormotomyia were discovered embedded in a matrix of dried bat guano adhering to the rock face directly below fissures at Ngauluka and Makilu Hills, also located in the Ukasi area. Later, rainy season visits to these two hills revealed populations of living Mormotomyia while, contemporaneously, flies were absent from the type locality. Like the type locality, the rock face directly below the fissures on Ngauluka and Makilu was discolored with pink and purple vertical streaking, presumably stained by bat urine and guano. Using the characteristically stained rock face as a search image, expeditions were expanded to include areas further afield and living flies were found at a third site 187 km to the south. Formerly considered “the rarest fly in the world”, the conservation status of Mormotomyia appears robust. Mormotomyia was actively preyed upon in the field by two species of lizards and remains of the fly were found in a jumping-spider nest. During laboratory observations of five live flies, the single male exhibited lengthy periods of female-guarding, with females being enclosed within the span of the much longer and setulose legs of males for more than 10 minutes.",

The factors involved in the origin of this unusual arboreal feeding behavior are unknown, but we discuss three possible, not mutually exclusive, hypotheses that require testing: (1) Umhlanga beach, South Africa (our study site), provides insufficient detrital food to support the dense populations of T. capensis found in this area, thus causing these animals to seek out other food sources, (2) the relatively palatable and abundant C. monilifera leaves provide an easily accessible and digestible food source, and (3) few competing insect herbivores feed on C. monilifera leaves at Umhlanga beach, thus locally freeing up this resource for T. capensis.",

Recent observations have led to the conclusion that all members of the genus, with the exception of O. krigei Schein, 1950, complete their larval development under dense shrubs, utilizing mainly leaf litter as food source and the shade provided by the host plant as protection against heat and desiccation. O. krigei makes use of termite hills to achieve the same, while feeding on detrital matter produced by termites. The coastal O. pubescens s. str. appears to be the only member that has feeding adults, which are able to ingest sap of Melianthus spp. shrubs after cutting the bark of the softest branches in the upper part of the plant canopy.",

Male and female terminalia are similar across species (e.g. structure of male hypandrium, aedeagus and surstylus) and the new genus is notable for the large body size (body length ca 5.5–6 mm), robust habitus, pointed head-shape, ornate body patterning, stump vein on M1 2, massive aedeagus, and large surstyli. In terms of prevailing suprageneric lauxaniid taxonomy, Proteaphila is placed in the subfamily Lauxaniinae because it has a sapromyziform costa, 1 mesotibial spur and lacks a profemoral ctenidium. The elongated frons of Proteaphila is similar to morphological modifications of the head in Trigonometopus Macquart and related genera of Trigonometopini, but without formal analysis, it must be assumed that this resemblance could have arisen convergently, with Proteaphila not being phylogenetically close to these genera. The bulk of specimens have been collected from Protea trees (Proteaceae), and the genus obviously has some as yet unelucidated biological relationship with proteas. Proteaphila is endemic to South Africa, being restricted to Protea-rich montane grassland in the Drakensberg Mountains of KwaZulu-Natal and fynbos (macchia) of the Western Cape. Three new species are described in the genus: Proteaphila maculosa Davies & Miller, sp. n., P. pajori Davies, Miller & Muller, sp. n. and P. stuckenbergorum Davies & Miller, sp. n.

A key to the species is provided. Palystes occurs in eastern and southern Africa. Patterns of biogeography and relationships in a redefined Palystinae, compared with sequences of hypothesised vicariance events during the evolution of the African landscape, suggest a southern African, minimum late Miocene-Pliocene origin for the genus. Three species groups, defined by markings and forms of male and female genitalia, are recognised: castaneus group (western Cape Province of South Africa - 3 species), lunafus group (eastern and interior western Cape Province of South Africa, Lesotho and Transkei - 6 species); superciliosus group (eastern and southern Africa - 6 species). Seventeen nominal species previously attributed to Palystes, including 11 from the Indo-Australasian region, are transferred to other genera, including a new genus, Parapalystes, which is also descriptionbed. These genera are discussed; annotated lists are provided for the African genera and for a resurrected Oceanian genus, Gnathopalystes Rainbow, 1899. Definitions of the family Heteropodidae and three subfamilies (Palystinae, Heteropodinae and Staianinae) affected by the revision, are reviewed. New genus: Parapalystes (type species: Parapalystes euphorbiae sp. n. from the north-western Cape, South Africa).

The collection of an exceptionally large female Triops (total length 57.7mm) from the northern Cape in 1988 prompted a re-examination of Triops material. Much variation (both intra- and inter-population) in the key taxonomic character of telsonic spine arrangement, was evident. Examination of the type material of Apus (T.) ovamboensis Barnard, conformed that ovamboensis is a synonym of T. cancriformis (Bosc), establishing that both T. granarius and T. cancriformis occur in southern Africa. The large specimen shares some characters with Apus (T.) trachyaspis Sars (a synonym of T. granarius). A number of samples from north-eastern Natal could not be identified, even if the criteria for T. granarius were broadened. The exceptional size of the northern Cape specimen could be a result of episodic flooding in March 1988, which may have influenced the hatching of a genetically distinct population of Triops or simply provided a habitat conducive to exceptional growth in T. granarius. There is a need for more detailed studies on the systematics of Triops,and on the morphological variation in key taxonomic characters. Habitat data and specimen measurements are presented for seventeen new localities.",

    "abstract": "A. T. Wilson proposed that the Last Interglacial ended with an ice-surge in Antarctica which would have raised ocean-level to about 15 m above present, and J. T. Hollin has collected evidence for a transgression higher than the peak of the interglacial under cold conditions, especially indicated by pollen, between Latitude 40Â° and 55Â° N. The surge was at first thought to have occurred at the end of Eem I about 120000 B.P., but Hollin now proposes the end of Eem II about 95000 B.P. This paper first discusses the sequence and chronology of the Last Interglacial, and then investigates geological and biological evidence for a marine transgression in the later part of the Eemian Interglacial in the South Cape, which faces Antarctica and so should be noticeably affected by ice-movements there. Around Port Elizabeth there was a transgression to + 18 m, leaving gravels which contain Late Acheulian artefacts, which according to recent evidence must be older than the Last Interglacial. After a regression, there was a second transgression to about +9 m, which has left estuarine beds with abundant warm-water and tropical molluscs, now extinct so far south; in places there are Middle Stone Age artefacts. Two sites have yielded specimens of this fauna at more than + 12 m. Racemisation-tests on molluscs from the +6-9 and the 12+ m beds show that the latter were considerably younger than the former, though it is not at present possible to obtain absolute dates by this method. The geological evidence is then reviewed for a transgression to + 12-+ 15 m around South Africa; molluscs are not indicative elsewhere. There is no sign of this transgression elsewhere in the South Cape and in Natal, little evidence at Langebaan Lagoon, a few doubtful sites in South West Africa (Namibia) and rather better evidence in Zululand. In general, the indications of such a transgression are poor; but it is not easy to explain the racemisation-figures from Port Elizabeth, and detailed investigation may reveal further sites where a short transgression took place, followed by a regression as expanding ice-sheets increased the albedo of the earth.",

Although the mammalian and floral components of this biome have been extensively studied, the invertebrate components have not. Conservation agencies have recognized the importance of biodiversity and many have shifted the management focus away from large mammals to biodiversity in general. This has led to the need for information on the invertebrate fauna of protected areas. This study formed part of a broader investigation of the factors affecting millipede, centipede and scorpion diversity in a savanna environment. Millipedes, centipedes and scorpions were sampled in the Greater Makalali Conservancy, Limpopo province, at 45 sites during two seasons, late summer (February / March 1999 and February / March 2000) and early summer (October / November 1999). Pitfall traps, active searching of random and nested quadrats, cryptozoan traps and wet cloths were used in sampling five different habitat types. In addition, some material was collected outside of the 45 sites in 1998 or during the sampling period, and records from another study in the Conservancy in 2000 and 2001 have also been included. Fourteen millipede species representing nine genera, within six families and three orders were sampled; 88 centipede specimens were sampled, representing six species (one undescribed), five genera and two orders; 76 scorpion specimens were collected, which included nine species belonging to six genera and three families. The high number of specimens, local specialists and restricted distribution species, indicate the importance of the savanna biome for the conservation of these three invertebrate groups.",

The parastomal bar is long, thin and dorsally curved at its middle; the intermediate sclerite consists of three parts (the posteroventral one clearly divided into an anterior ventral and a posterior longish section); there is an additional long sclerite, of an intricate form, between the intermediate sclerite and mandible.

    "abstract": "An annotated key to the genera of afrotropical Asilinae is provided. The key is provisional as some genera, not examined in this paper, still require revision, and the occurrence of others in the region require confirmation. \nThe afrotropical species of Neomochtherus Osten Sacken, 1878 sensu Tsacas (1969) are reviewed in view of Lehr's (1969) action of splitting the genus into five separate genera (i.e. Afromochtherus Lehr, Aneomochtherus Lehr, Neomochtherus, Pashtshenkoa Lehr and Tsacasiella Lehr). Research supports the validity of Afromochtherus, Aneomochtherus and Tsacasiella, but suggests that there are no afrotropical species that should be placed in Neomochtherus or Pashtshenkoa. New genera are erected for the species placed in the latter two genera by Lehr (i.e. Caenoura and Melouromyia). Five additional genera (Dikowmyia, Gongromyia, Notomochtherus, Sphagomyia and Valiraptor) are described to accommodate a number of previously undescribed southern African species. Tables and maps are provided that summarise the findings of this paper. In all, 37 species placed in 10 genera are recognised. \nNew genera: Caenoura (Type-species: Mochtherus annulitarsis Loew, 1858); Dikowmyia (Type-species: Dikowmyia mediorus sp. n.); Gongromyia (Type-species: Gongromyia bulla sp. n.); Melouromyia (Typespecies: Heligmonevra natalensis Ricardo, 1919); Notomochtherus (Type-species: Notomochtherus brevicauda sp. n.); Sphagomyia (Type-species: Sphagomyia botswana sp. n.); Valiraptor (Type-species: Valiraptor silvestris sp. n.). \nNew species: Afromochtherus - anatolicus (South Africa); astiptus (Namibia); kolodrillus (South Africa); malawi (Malawi); megastylus (Namibia); melanurus (South Africa); mkomazi (Tanzania); peri (South Africa, Botswana); sathus (Zimbabwe, Zambia); zoropegus (South Africa). Dikowmyia - mediorus (South Africa). Gongromyia - bulla (South Africa). Melouromyia - diaphorus (South Africa). Notomochtherus - brevicauda (South Africa). Sphagomyia - botswana (Botswana, South Africa); kenya (Kenya). Tsacasiella - inornata (Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Zimbabwe). Valiraptor - montanus (South Africa); namibiensis (Namibia); silvestris (South Africa); vittatus (South Africa). \nNew synonyms: Dinozabrus Hull, 1962 = Machimus Loew, 1849; Neomochtherus callipygus Tsacas, 1969 = Tsacasiella blanda (Tsacas, 1969); Neomochtherus genialis Tsacas, 1969 = Afromochtherus unctus (Oldroyd, 1939); Neomochtherus notatus Tsacas, 1969 = Tsacasiella futilis (Tsacas, 1969); Neomochtherus ochrapes Hull, 1967 = Caenoura annulitarsis (Loew, 1858); Neomochtherus signatipes Lindner, 1955 = Aneomochtherus africanus (Ricardo, 1919). Although previously suggested, Cobalomyia Hull, 1962 is here confirmed to be a synonym of Heligmonevra Bigot, 1858. \nNew combinations: Caenoura annulitarsis (Loew, 1858) and Caenoura sinuatus (Loew, 1858), both transferred from Neomochtherus; Melouromyia natalensis (Ricardo, 1919) transferred from Pashtshenkoa (originally Heligmonevra). \nType-locality designations: Mochtherus annulitarsis Loew, 1858; Mochtherus sinuatus Loew, 1858; Heligmonevra natalensis Ricardo, 1919.",

This discord has resulted in the lack of secure foundations within entomological theory. However, several recent articles provide key information which may help to resolve some of the long-standing disputes. Some biologists have argued that the first winged insects might have been amphibiotic rather than terrestrial and that metamorphosis might have originated as an adaptation to amphibiotic life. Thus entomological theory may now be passing through a paradigm shift where, for the first time, the phylogenetic tree for all insects may be firmly rooted.",

A comparative examination of these two species using both morphological assessment and molecular sequence data from the COI barcode region supported the recognition of S. peringueyi as a valid species, which we accordingly resurrect as the second species of the Scrapter heterodoxus species group. We provide high resolution images of the type specimens for both species and updated diagnoses to enable their separation from all other species of Scrapter .",

    "abstract": "Male gonopods are useful in taxonomic diagnoses and descriptions of millipedes, although they may vary intraspecifically in shape and size. To assess this intraspecific variation, we used geometric morphometric analysis to compare gonopod morphology among eight isolated populations of the colour-polymorphic southern African millipede Bicoxidens flavicollis . Our results showed that gonopod shapes vary significantly across the examined populations, and elucidated subtle variations. CVA cross-validation test indicates an average classification rate of 75% for the five populations for which we had more than one specimen. Although we had a small number of replicates for three populations, our results still illustrate the importance of applying quantitative approaches to what would otherwise be qualitative and subjective gonopod shape categories in millipedes. As such, the taxonomic assignment of the populations of B. flavicollis may require further investigation, and further revisions would be required with an integrative approach, including molecular data, in order to re-evaluate the taxonomic diversity and distribution data of this species. Finally, we highlight the conservation potential of divergent populations as evolutionary insurance against a dynamic and unpredictable climate, whether or not they undergo full speciation.",

Behavioural observations on a population of Afrocamilla stuckenbergi at Jackson's Falls in the Assagay/Shongweni area of Natal, have shown that adults there were restricted to faecal pellets in a latrine of the rock hyrax Procavia capensis (Pallas). Adults were laboratory reared from a sample of this dung. Copulation is descriptionbed, as are characteristic abdominal and wing movement. The upward flexure of the elongate bristles on tergum 2 beneath the surface of the folded wings, produces a striking up-and-down wing movement which probably has a signalling function.",

Unidentified sciomyzid puparia found in the shells of the invasive Grey Snail, Theba pisana (MA¼ller), first reported by Miller (1993 1994), probably belong to Ethiolimnia species.

A reassessment of relationships suggests that irwini and umbraticola are sister-groups. Grounds for the original inclusion of umbraticola in the genus Lampromyia Macquart, 1835 are now known to be invalid, and a new genus, Alhajarmyia, is erected for this species. Biogeographical implications of the relationship between these Arabian and Madagascan taxa are discussed.

    "abstract": "A revision of the world-wide available material of the Afrotropical streptaxid subgenus Avakubia Pilsbry, 1919, prompted the change in status to independent genus and the detection of undescribed species. In addition to the two earlier described species, A. avakubiensis (Pilsbry, 1919) and A. acuminata (Thiele, 1933), the genus Avakubia is found to embrace at least seven new species, viz., A. crystallum de Winter, sp.n. from Gabon; A. fruticicola de Winter & Vastenhout, sp. n., A. semenguei de Winter & Vastenhout, sp. n. and A. subacuminata de Winter & Vastenhout, sp. n. from Cameroon; A. ortizdezarateorum de Winter & Vastenhout, sp. n. and A. biokoensis de Winter & Vastenhout, sp. n. from Bioko I., Equatorial Guinea, and A. occidentalis de Winter, sp. n. from Ghana. Of some other potentially new Avakubia species insufficient material is available to allow a formal description. For a West African radiation with remarkably similar shells, but differing from true Avakubia in protoconch and teleoconch characters, a new genus Pseudavakubia de Winter & Vastenhout, gen. n. is erected with four new species, viz., P. atewaensis de Winter, sp. n., P. majus de Winter & Vastenhout, sp. n. (type species), P. ghanaensis de Winter, sp. n., and P. liberiana de Winter, sp. n. Avakubia avakubiensis has been reported in the literature from Uganda to Liberia, a range of 4750 km. Study of this material restricts the range of this species to the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda, the remaining records were found to refer to five other species of Avakubia or Pseudavakubia described in this paper, each with a much more restricted range. The genital anatomy of both Avakubia and Pseudavakubia is found to deviate from most other members of the family Streptaxidae in the absence of chitinous spines in the penis. Both genera are ovoviviparous. In the penis of a specimen of A. acuminata a spermatophore-like structure was found. Some aspects of the ecology of these rainforest-dwelling snails are described. An identification key to the species of Avakubia and Pseudavakubia is provided.",

A new junior synonym of D. chubbi is Blennocampa bensoni Forsius, 1931 (syn. n. ).

Kivua Forsius, 1934 is transferred from the Blennocampinae to the Allantinae. New junior synonyms of Kivua are Bicrista Pasteels, 1949 (syn. n.), Tumura Pasteels, 1949 (syn. n.) and Urocerca Pasteels, 1949 (syn. n.).

Although much can be said about the merits (or lack thereof) of our study, we limit our rebuttal to the four points specifically raised by Mlambo.\nThe first point, that assigning functional feeding groups (FFG) is simpler than assigning family level, is rightfully contested by Mlambo and our paper did not provide quantitative evidence of this. Certain FFG cannot be assigned without traditional taxonomic efforts but many others can. For example, although large families such as Scarabaeidae and Muscidae cannot easily be assigned to FFG without further identification, many orders, such as adult Odonata, Neuroptera and Orthoptera, and superfamilies, such as parasitoid Ichneumonoidea and the piercing/sucking Pentatomoidea, share broad feeding styles. Based on our experience, we believe that on average it is simpler to assign FFG than other taxonomic levels. Mlambo's assertion that Kaiser et al. (2009) provide empirical evidence against the use of FFG is unfounded: their study also lacked quantitative evidence of taxonomic difficulties and their judgements were as subjective as ours.",

Thanks to protection of the type material at the Natural History Museum, University of Oslo, Norway, this species can be redescribed and illustrated, and its lectotype and paralectotype are designated. Types of Microchaetus zulu Michaelsen, 1907, a junior synonym of Tritogenia zuluensis, safely stored for more than a hundred years in the Göteborg Natural History Museum, Sweden, was most helpful in the process of re-description. The significant role played by museums and similar organizations in protecting past and present natural resource treasures for the future, is highlighted. The crucial function of natural history collections in supporting traditional taxonomy, the key to understanding biodiversity, is clearly demonstrated.",

In 1931 Lawrence created another monotypic genus, Oonopsopilio, and in 1935 synonymised it with Caddella and described one more species with a colour variety. Kauri (1961) redescribed C. capensis and C. africana but left the genus in Acropsopilionidae. In 1975 Shear, when revising the American forms of Caddidae, included the African species and assigned them to this family, recognising Acropsopilioninae as a subfamily.

A. stuckenbergi Barraclough, 1992, is newly recorded from the Eastern Cape. Both armata and stuckenbergi are redescriptionbed. An illustrated key to the seven named species is presented. The biology and ecology of the South African fauna is discussed, particularly its association with excrement of the rock hyrax Procavia capensis (Pallas). All species except artopenna sp. n. and sineseta sp. n. have been collected from hyrax excrement and occur sympatrically with other species. Species relationships are briefly discussed, and the fauna is provisionally divided into four groups. One of these groups, the armata-complex, contains four closely related species (armata (Hackman, 1960), elongata sp. n., adusta Barraclough, 1997 (Tanzania) and stuckenbergi Barraclough, 1992) which are reliably distinguished only by structures of the male terminalia.

Nonetheless, traditional taxonomy has often been marginalised among biological sciences by policy- and decision-makers, and left for old-fashioned museum eccentrics. Moreover, few high-profile scholarly journals these days accept long taxonomic revisions unless based on 'cutting edge' DNA sequencing or/and computer-generated phylogenetic trees.

All male Afrotropical Pachycerina have the protandrium partially fused to tergite 6 and possess simplified genitalia lacking an aedeagus and hypandrium. The absence of the aedeagus is an apparently unusual condition for lauxaniids, only otherwise recorded in Minettia Robineau-Desvoidy (Lauxaniinae) and beetle fly genera (Celyphinae). The male sternite 5 shows notable variability across species and is a useful aid to identification. A generic diagnosis and species identification key to Pachycerina males are provided.

    "abstract": "Invertebrates are often not considered when reviewing conservation and biodiversity issues in southern Africa. This paper reviews the conservation status of 11 rarely encountered Diptera families in the subregion, and presents data on their distribution, biology and habitat requirements (if known) and all other pertinent, published information. As six of the families (Marginidae, Aulacigastridae, Campichoetidae, Neurochaetidae, Tachiniscidae and Corethrellidae) occur in Afromontane forest or its margins, atmospheric warming is briefly discussed, as this could impact on biodiversity at higher altitudes. The conservation of Afromontane forest patches (and associated grassland) in southern Africa is discussed, most notably those in the southeastern highlands of Zimbabwe (source of all known southern African Marginidae, Neurochaetidae, Tachiniscidae) and the central Natal Drakensberg (source of the only named southern African Thaumaleidae, Aulacigastridae, Campichoetidae). The 11 rarely encountered families are provisionally divided into three groups based on habitat specificity and geographical range. The first group of families is comprised of eurytopic species with widespread geographical ranges (Odiniidae, Ctenostylidae). We predict that informed collecting will show that neither family is particularly uncommon in southern Africa. The second group (Tanyderidae, Thaumaleidae, Marginidae, Aulacigastridae, Neminidae, Campichoetidae, Neurochaetidae) are stenotopic species with restricted geographical ranges. Tanyderidae and Thaumaleidae are considered to be families requiring conservation priority. The third group of families (Tachiniscidae and possibly Corethrellidae) are thought to have species with widespread geographical ranges, but are stenotopic.",

The respiratory organs of P. ingens (subgenus Paulianina s.s.) have a primitive anatomy and resemble in some respects the gills of the neotropic Edwardsina chilota, whereas the species of the subgenus Eupaulianina are unique among Blephariceridae not only because of the peculiar shape of their respiratory processes, but also because of the special structure of the plastron. An additional apomorphic character of this subgenus is a blister at the terminal end of the dorsal granules on the pupal tergites. P. umbra (Paulianina s.s.) seems to be an intermediate form with regard to gill structure. Based on the morphological findings, a phylogeny of Paulianina is proposed that includes, contrary to current systematics, the subgenus Paulianina s.s. as a paraphyletic taxon. The adaptive value of the transformation of respiratory lamellae into broad swellings is obscure, because all Paulianina species develop in fast-flowing streams and therefore live in the same type of habitat as other blepharicerids. The complex pattern of arrangement of the dorsal granules of Eupaulianina agrees well with the flow pattern around blepharicerid pupae.",

A new genus of this group, Afraustraloxenodes, is erected for three new species: namibiensis (the type-species), from Namibia; coineaui, from Namibia and Angola ; and hulleyi, from South Africa. A fourth member, Monographis schultzei Attems, 1909, from South Africa, formerly placed in Chilexenus, is now also added to Afraustraloxenodes, based upon a re-examination of a syntype of C. rosendinus showing, as in Macroxenus, a spine on tarsus II, which was not mentioned by Silvestri (1948). The new genus Afraustraloxenodes resembles Macroxenodes in lacking tarsal spines, but it differs in the number, shape and arrangement of the antennal sensilla. All four Southern African species belonging to this new genus differ from each other chiefly in their antennal sensilla and in their labral ornamentation.",

    "abstract": "It has been speculated that the unusual loss of the ptilinum and ptilinal suture in species of the Sepedon lineage is an apomorphy, which correlates with the development of labellar hooks in the proboscis (well developed hooks are typically absent in other Sciomyzidae). To test this theory, the labellum of four South African species of Sepedon was studied using scanning electron microscopy. It was confirmed that all four species have well-developed labellar hooks of various sizes (number of hooks per labellar lobe in parentheses) : S. neavei Steyskal (7-9), S. pleuritica Loew (6), S. scapularis Adams (17) and S. testacea Loew (17). The labellar hooks are strongly curved and sclerotised, inwardly directed and of similar size and form in all four species. However, in S. pleuritica, a remarkable, short, rod-like structure is present at the anteroventral base of each hook. Labellar hooks never arise from the pseudotracheal ring tips, although they are often inserted immediately adjacent to pseudotracheal rows. The apparent form and development of the pseudotracheal rings, and the nature of the interpseudotracheal membrane, are described for all four species. It was estimated that S. pleuritica, S. scapularis and S. testacea each have 15 to 16 pseudotracheae per labellar lobe. Species of Ditaeniella Sack and Ethiolimnia geniculata Loew, both with the ptilinal suture present, lack labellar hooks, have inconspicuous pseudotracheal rings and a largely undifferentiated interpseudotracheal membrane.",

    "abstract": "On October 13, 1961, Mr. R. D. McLean found a large Cephalopod on the beach near the lighthouse at Cape Recife, Algoa Bay, south-east of Port Elizabeth. It appeared to be dying, the suckers on the arms still showing reflex movements. The next morning it was taken to the Port Elizabeth Museum where it was deepfrozen after external measurements had been taken. The whole body was more or less uniformly coloured in exactly the same shade of brownish brick-red as Loligo vulgaris, the skin clearly showing the macrochromatophores. On arrival the body was still liberally covered with quantities of black ink from the ink gland. The specimen was subsequently identified as a male of Thysanoteuthis rhombus Troschel 1857, having the left ventral arm hectocotylized. Unfortunately it was impossible to weigh the specimen when fresh, but it has been estimated to have weighed between 40 and 45 lbs. (roughly 18-20 kg).",

As part of the South African National Survey of Arachnida (SANSA), the spider diversity of the Soutpansberg Mountain was determined over 27 years: 58 families, 293 genera, and 585 species were recorded. The Salticidae with 85 species, followed by Thomisidae (81 species), Araneidae, and Gnaphosidae, with 45 species each, are the most species-rich, while 11 families are represented by single species. Global distributions, endemicity, and conservation assessment are provided for each species using IUCN criteria. Most species (516, 88.1%) are widely distributed with no known threats and are of Least Concern, whereas eight species (1.4%) are of special concern. Of these, five species are Rare and one each is Critically Rare, Vulnerable, and Near Threatened. Twenty-five new species have been described from the SM since 1997, but 17 species (2.9%) are still Data Deficient, and 44 species were not evaluated due to unresolved taxonomy. The SM represents a spider biodiversity hotspot in the Limpopo Province, representing 25.4% of the total spider fauna of South Africa and 64.3% of the known spider fauna of the Limpopo Province.",

    "abstract": "The snouted harvester termite ( Trinervitermes trinervoides (Sjöstedt, 1911)) is a widespread grass-eating termite species that constructs thermoregulated dome-shaped mounds. However, little is known about the influence of these mounds on the arthropod assemblage structure in the surrounding grassland matrix, and whether the mounds represent ecological islands. Spiders and springtails are two ecologically important arthropod groups often associated with termites or their mounds. We investigated their assemblage composition inside and around active and abandoned T. trinervoides mounds in a central South African grassland. In total, 838 spiders (59 spp., 22 families) and 217 857 springtails (24 spp., 9 families) were collected from 96 pitfall traps, placed at four microhabitats in and around each of 12 active and 12 abandoned mounds during March 2019. The most abundant and species-rich spider families include the Gnaphosidae (n = 270, 10 spp.), Zodariidae (n = 86, 7 spp.), Lycosidae (n = 86, 6 spp.) and Salticidae (n = 77, 5 spp.), whereas the springtail fauna was dominated by Brachystomellidae (n = 56 521, 1 species), Bourletiellidae (n = 49 573, 7 species), Sminthurididae (n = 44 491, 3 species), Isotomidae (n = 32 288, 1 species) and Entomobryidae (n = 26 216, 7 species). Indicator analysis showed that the spiders Zelotes sclateri Tucker, 1923, Heliocapensis termitophagus (Wesołowska &amp; Haddad, 2002) and Scytodes elizabethae Purcell, 1904 are associated with abandoned mounds, but no springtails showed an association based on the IndVal analysis of the eight microhabitats (lumped data), even though the undescribed Cyphoderus sp. were mostly collected inside active mounds. The mounds thus had a negligible influence on the spatial distribution of springtails in the surrounding grassland. The different spider and springtail assemblages sampled indicate that both active and abandoned mounds function as ecological islands in grasslands, but that mound size does not affect their abundance or species richness in the different microhabitats sampled.",

The world fauna, distribution of Diastata Meigen and Campichoeta Macquart, and the relationships of these genera are briefly discussed. Support is given for the refutation by McAlpine (1989) of the concept that Diastata is more closely related to the Ephydridae than to Campichoeta and Euthychaeta Loew, although the subfamily concepts Diastatinae and Campichoetinae are adopted. Detailed keys to the Afrotropical genera and subfamilies are provided. The boreal distribution of African Diastata species is reviewed and compared to that of the South American fauna. The distribution pattern of southern African species is assessed separately. An illustrated key to the eight Afrotropical species is presented. Three new species are descriptionbed from Natal, South Africa: falcata; interrupta; whittingtoni. The female of D. carolinae Cogan is descriptionbed, and D. tsacasi Cogan is recorded from the Transvaal and eastern Cape Provinces of South Africa, both for the first time. Species are diagnosed based predominantly on wing patterning and features of the male terminalia; the affinities of all species are covered in detail. The subfamily Campichoetinae (Campichoeta) is recorded from the Afrotropical Region for the first time. Two closely allied montane species are descriptionbed: edwardsi (Ethiopia and Kenya) and natalensis (Natal, South Africa). A key to the two species is presented. The distribution patterns of African Diastatidae are discussed relative to those of other boreal and/or montane invertebrates, including particular Opomyzidae and Chloropidae. Tentative theories explaining the current disjunct distributions of Campichoeta and Diastata are suggested.",

Two new species of Aulacigaster are descriptionbed: africana (Royal Natal National Park, Natal, South Africa) and perata (Bamenda highlands, Cameroon). A third species, based on a single damaged male from Cathedral Peak (Natal, South Africa) is left undescriptionbed and is considered to have closer affinity with the Palaearctic species A. leucopeza (Meigen, 1830) than with the former two species. All three African species of Aulacigaster were taken at relatively high altitude (1500 m).

Species of Group I are confined to the winter-rainfall area in the South-West Cape, those in Group 2 are from the Southern Cape coastal strip, those in Groups 3 and 4 are from montane forests in Natal, Swaziland and the Eastern Transvaal escarpment. All the species are flightless and humicolous. It is considered that these species originated from perhaps four closely allied ancestral species dimorphic in respect of wing development, and that loss of wings, halteres and other modifications evolved polyphyletically. In 1960, I received from Mr. B. R. Stuckenberg and described a wingless fly from Eastern Cape Province (Storms River Pass). This was a new species of a new genus of Sphaeroceri­ dae, Scutelliseta Richards, 1960, distinguished especially by the situation of the posterior",

This forest is made up mainly of Quercus ilex and Pinus halepensis trees and the most important bush species is Arbutus unedo. The litter is of leptomoder type, with an average pH of 5.88. Field sampling was performed for 24 months in order to quantify the density of edaphic arthropods. In the experimental plot (40 x 40 m), three horizons were sampled : L/F, H, and A (leaf litter fall, humus, and the first five cm of the mineral layer). A cylindrical corer with a diameter of 0.36 m was used as a sampling device. Five replicate samples were taken at each sampling.\nA remarkably dense population of Lithobius tricuspis, comprising males, females and larvae, was recorded. Density fluctuations of this species, as well as horizon preferences, were analysed during the study. Mean density in the whole profile was 73.35 individuals / m2 with a notable value of 39.17 individuals / m2 in horizon H. Values of Usher index also indicated a preference for this horizon. In the whole of the soil profile, 36.84 % of the individuals were males ]and females (adults and immature specimens) and 63.15 % corresponded to larvae (stadia L1, L2, L3 and L4). The sex ratio was 1.84. Finally, there was an attempt to interpret phenology of L. tricuspis through the correlation between mean density values and climatic parameters. Neither temperature, nor rainfall, nor water content had inluenced the monthly density distribution of adults. On the contrary, average monthly density in larvae, especially LIII and LIV, is positively correlated with the soil water content and negatively correlated with temperature.",

The grana contain an electron-dense area in their centre, from which the fibrous material detaches. The grana transform themselves to vacuoles. The tubules may be released from the vacuoles of the plasmatocytes, either individually or in compact clusters into the hemolymph, where they probably support coagulation. Hemolymph coagulation observed in S. coleoptrata is remarkably strong. This special coagulation behaviour correlates functionally with the special leg-autotomy capabilities of these animals. S. coleoptrata lives predominantly in dry habitats, where fast wound healing would appear to have a selective advantage in securing survival.",

However, apart from various minor differences, the suture of G. perspicua is always excavated, so that shells of both taxa normally can be differentiated without undue trouble.",

RodneyCarrington Wood was clearly a man with a passion for Africa and its biota. He was also an unusual character, on the one hand flighty and unable to stick to a task for any length of time, yet on the other a dedicated and talented natural historian. In this latter mould, he built up a formidable knowledge of the countryside in which he lived (mostly Malawi), based on first hand observations and experience, such that those who knew him regarded him with esteem. He was also a person happy to share this knowledge with others, and in so doing entertain and inspire them.",

    "abstract": "Considering the precarious conservation status of the grassland biome in South Africa, effective assessment and monitoring is imperative.The potential use of terrestrial arthropods in ecological assessment has re ceived much attention, but little headway has been made in formulating standardised bioassessment protocols.A suggested reason for this lack of progress is the high diversity of terrestrial arthropods and the high taxonomic expertise required.Sampling was carried out across 12 months in the Bloemfontein Dry Grassland vegetation type and the potential of using functional feeding groups (FFG) as taxonomic surrogates for family level arthropods was investigated.An F-test associated with an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) found a significant correlation between FFG and families for measures of richness, Shannon and Simpson diversity.Accumulation curves indicated that a higher proportion of FFG than families could be assessed with the same sampling intensity.Both families and FFG best fitted the stochastic normal and geometric series relative abundance distribution models, implying that there is no distinction between the taxonomic units with regard to abundance distributions.The reality remains that information does become lost when using surrogacy, so there will continue to be a need for specialist ecological proficiency for the highest risk assessments.It was concluded that for rapid monitoring and snap-shot assessments, FFG could be used as a valuable and reliable taxonomic surrogate.",

    "abstract": "Three years ago our esteemed colleague Brian Stuckenberg, the doyen of Afrotropical dipterology, left his professional fraternity and this world. Time flies like an arrow, yet our memories of Brian do not fade. This is best attested by the present issue of African Invertebrates that commemorates Brian's life and scientific career with contributions made by 37 fellow dipterists from 15 countries. The Gedenkschrift opens with a dedication article by A.H. Kirk-Spriggs, who provides a biography and summary of Brian's major achievements. The article is supplemented by Brian's previously unpublished reports on his two Madagascan expeditions and includes a full list of his publications. The following 20 articles deal with the taxonomy, nomenclature, systematics and biogeography of representatives of 19 families of nematoceran and brachyceran Diptera. In total, four new genera and 58 new species are described, with one genus and 16 species named after Brian. Most papers include identification keys. All articles are of a high standard and make a substantial addition to our knowledge of Afrotropical Diptera, still I would like to highlight several contributions. T. Dikow's detailed review of the Mydidae tribe Halterorchini is the first cybertaxonomic article in the history of African Invertebrates . By providing hyperlinks to ZooBank, Morphbank and GBIF, it sets a new standard for future taxonomic publications in the journal. J.-H. Stuke's revision of Stylogaster (Conopidae) is the most comprehensive and richly illustrated study done on this genus in the Afrotropics, and is directly linked to Brian's interest in this genus back in 1960s. Brian also had a particular interest in the bruchomyiine moth flies (Psychodidae) and himself contributed to the study of fossil and modern representatives of the genus Nemopalpus in the article prepared by R. Wagner. The Afrotropical Diptera fauna is still far from being exhaustively known, and Brian's legacy for the present and upcoming generations of dipterists is to study it in its entirety. I wish to thank all contributors to this Gedenkschrift and numerous reviewers, who critically evaluated all the manuscripts. Dr A.H. Kirk-Spriggs solicited contributions, co-ordinated the peer-review process and handled correspondence with the authors; this project would not have succeeded without him. I am grateful to Prof. D.J. Brothers, who expertly commented on numerous manuscripts and generously undertook the laborious task of language editing; copy-editing was also done by Prof. M.B. Markus. I sincerely appreciate meticulous work of Mr B. Muller, our graphics editor, and Dr M. Ovechkina, who did the proof-reading of each article and the entire issue. Last but not least, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the Deputy Director of the KwaZulu-Natal Museum Mr S. Miya and the Chief Financial Manager Mr M. Mazibuko for their overall and financial support of the journal. I regret that some manuscripts could not be included in this Gedenkschrift due to technical reasons; they will be published in the next issue of African Invertebrates , thus continuing to commemorate Brian.

A distribution map based on the Natal Museum material shows that the family is widely distributed in the eastern summer rainfall region ; it is suggested that natalimyzids may prove to be absent from the arid north-west of the country (Northern Cape). Natalimyzidae have been collected from a variety of habitats, ranging from coastal dune vegetation to grassland at about 2800 m in the KwaZulu-Natal Drakensberg; although grassland is the predominant habitat, some species occur in forested areas. Grassland species sometimes occur sympatrically, and at a particular habitat there may be a succession of species through the seasons. Highest abundance during the dry winter months in the eastern provinces is confirmed; only 13% of the 420 specimens studied was collected during the five-month summer rainfall period from September to February.",

One new species, Anypodetus londti sp. nov. from Mozambique and Zimbabwe, is described for a total of nine species in the genus. Study of the secondary type specimens of A. unicolor from Namibia revealed that these specimens do not represent this species, reducing the number of species recorded from Namibia to six. Anypodetus leucothrix is recorded with several additional collecting events in central and northern Namibia extending its range significantly. Distribution, biology, occurrence in biodiversity hotspots sensu Conservation International, and seasonal imago flight activity are discussed.

A sixth species, Aristobatina principalis (Frey, 1929), currently recorded from Malawi, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, may also occur in Northern Province, and is provisionally included in an illustrated key to the South African species of Micropezidae. Each species is diagnosed, and the male terminalia and sternite 5 are illustrated where pertinent. Micropeza corrigiolata, a holarctic species and presumed introduction from Europe, is newly recorded from the Afrotropical Region; this is also the first record of Micropeza Meigen, 1803 and the Micropezinae in the Afrotropics. The endemic south-east African genus Aristobatina Verbeke, 1951, is briefly reviewed, and a key to the two species provided. Cephalosphen conifrons is redescriptionbed and sexual dimorphism of the wing apex is noted; this silvicolous species is commonly collected from trunks of Albizia adianthifolia in coastal KwaZulu-Natal. Behavioural observations of three species are recorded, particularly the ichneumonid-like posturing and movement of the pale fore tarsi in the species of Mimegralla Rondani, 1850. Paired, convex structures are strikingly present in the pleural membrane below abdominal tergite 2 in both Mimegralla species; this structure is illustrated and its possible glandular function discussed. Lectotypes are designated for the following nominal species: Tanypoda rufithorax Enderlein, 1922 (a Tanzanian species of Aristobatina), Taeniaptera conifrons Bigot, 1886, Tanypoda fuelleborni Enderlein, 1922, and Hybobata tessmanni Enderlein, 1922.",

Dann befasste Grouvelle sich wieder mit diesen KA¤fern und beschrieb zwanzig neue Spezies, doch kam seine Studie erst 1927 posthum heraus, nachdem ich bereits die weitere Arbeit an dieser Gattung auf Anregung von Dr. Walther Horn A¼bernommen hatte. Inzwischen gab Erichson 1845 in einer Fussnote zu den Cerylini die Gattung Discoloma (Amerika) bekannt, welche spA¤ter auf G. Horns Vorschlag den Familiennamen stellte. G. Horn hatte in den Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc. 17, 1878, S. 556 nach einem Exemplar die Gattung Hyberis aufgestellt, die synonym zu Notiophygus ist.

Centr.-Amer. 2, S. 495, 1895). Anatomische Untersuchungen veranlassten mich aber, die Discolomidae wieder als eigene Familie anzusehen (Fam.-Diagn., Ent.

This flood washed away floodplain forest litter and most of epigeic soil invertebrates. Three adjoining floodplain forests were investigated to examine the effect of the flood on the population of Leptoiulus proximus (Nĕmec, 1896) between January 1998 and February 2002. The animals were collected by pitfall trapping and heat-extraction from soil samples.\nThis study initially showed a negative impact of flooding on the population of L. proximus. The number of individuals of L. proximus was very low in 1999, increased substantially in 2000 and decreased in 2001. The life span of L. proximus is estimated to be three years. The proportion of individual developmental stages of the population was unbalanced during the first three years, and seemed to approach the natural state in the last year of the study. The post-flood structure of the millipede community of the study site was markedly different in comparison with those in undisturbed localities. It illustrated a fluctuating proportion of L. proximus over the entire observation period. Neither community nor population structure had been fully restored by the end of the study period.",

Morphs of the 'P. novaezealandiae-complex' were observed in culture, and on the basis of live specimens, a preliminary key was developed for the identification of six different morpho types. These can be distinguished by the following characters : colour and shape of the genital aperture, converging or nonconverging ventral anal papillae, presence or absence of two orange-coloured 'ocular' papillae, and the shape of the nephropore on the 4th and the 5th legs. Data from adults of six morphs and from 41 offspring of four morphs were recorded and illustrated in order to facilitate future taxonomic research. Supplementary information on juveniles was due to observations of 27 individuals from two additional morphs. The females, probably iteroparous seasonal breeders, gave birth after 17 to 24 months in captivity. They appeared to be able to defer release of embryos or to fertilise eggs with stored sperm. Morphs could be distinguished by the different duration of their reproductive periods. Based on changes in pigmentation and on the brightness of the integument in new born animals, three stages were distinguished : stage I, glistening neonates with varying degrees of pigmentation; stage II, juveniles with stronger pigmentation, but without lustre; stage III, fully pigmented juveniles. The degree of pigmentation is found to correlate with the morpho type. Moreover, the shape and the morphology of the anal cone in morphs aged two and five months can be used to distinguish gender.",

    "abstract": "The cicada genus Tugelana Distant, 1912 is monotypic and endemic to south-eastern Africa. Material was not available for a recent molecular phylogeny of its tribe, so its precise phylogenetic placement is unestablished. Consequently, a 627 bp sequence of the cytochrome oxidase gene was obtained and its candidate relatives identified as several species of Platypleura Amyot &amp;amp; Audinet-Serville, 1843 using the BOLD Identification System and NCBI Genbank’s BLAST. Bayesian inference analyses indicated that the type species, the Maputaland Orangewing Cicada Tugelana butleri Distant, 1912, is closely related to the Dune Koko Orangewing Cicada Platypleura zuluensis Villet, 1989, which has a geographical distribution that is parapatric with T. butleri and which has aberrant genitalia for a member of Platypleura . This pair of species is placed fairly deep within the African clade of Platypleura . We therefore formally recognized Platypleura Amyot &amp;amp; Audinet-Serville, 1843 as a senior synonym of Tugelana Distant, 1912, syn. nov. , and assign T. butleri Distant, 1912 to Platypleura as Platypleura butleri (Distant 1912), comb. nov. The species occurs on the wooded grasslands of the Maputaland coastal plateau east of Lebombo Mountains and south of Maputo Bay. Its Extent of Occurrence is about 6360 km 2 , which would qualify it as Vulnerable under the IUCN’s classification criteria for conservation status.",

Given the land use and management impact biodiversity, the aim of this study was to document earthworm species that occur under cultivated land in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands. A survey of nine farms that practise conservation agriculture was carried out between 2018 and 2020. Twelve earthworm species belonging to four introduced families: Acanthodrilidae ( Dichogaster bolaui ), Rhinodrilidae ( Pontoscolex corenthrurus ), Lumbricidae ( Aporrectodea caliginosa , Aporrectodea rosea , Aporrectodea trapezoides , Lumbricus rubellus , Octolasion cyaneum , Octolasion lacteum ), Megascolecidae ( Amynthas aeruginosus , Amynthas corticis , Amynthas gracilis , Amynthas rodericensis ) and juveniles from an indigenous family Tritogeniidae were recorded from cultivated fields. The type of crop (habitat) affected both species richness and abundance of earthworms significantly. However, post hoc results showed differences in species richness between the soya and the maize only, with greater species richness in the maize. Our results demonstrate that habitat type has a major influence on communities of earthworms in agroecosystems.",

These three species clarify relationships and enable a new cladistic analysis of Vermipardus to be made. The previously defined promontorii species-group erected for two Cape Peninsula species is shown to be composite; V. promontorii (Stuckenberg) and barracloughi prove to be sister-species constituting a clade at subgeneric level, while V. brincki (Stuckenberg) is associated with trisignatus and whiteheadi in the newly-recognised brincki subgroup.
