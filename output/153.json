    "abstract": "Most agronomic soils contain large reserves of total phosphorus [P], but the fixation and precipitation of P cause P deficiency, and in turn, restrict the growth of crops severely. Phosphorus replenishment, especially in sustainable production systems, remains a major challenge as it is mainly fertilizer-dependent. Though the use of chemical P fertilizers is obviously the best means to circumvent P deficiency in different agro-ecosystems, their use is always limited due to its spiralling cost. A greater interest has, therefore, been generated to find an alternative yet inexpensive technology that could provide sufficient P to plants while reducing the dependence on expensive chemical P fertilizers. Among the heterogeneous and naturally abundant microbes inhabiting the rhizosphere, the phosphate solubilizing microorganisms (PSM) including bacteria have provided an alternative biotechnological solution in sustainable agriculture to meet the P demands of plants. These organisms in addition to providing P to plants also facilitate plant growth by other mechanisms. Despite their different ecological niches and multiple functional properties, P-solubilizing bacteria have yet to fulfil their promise as commercial bio-inoculants. Current developments in our understanding of the functional diversity, rhizosphere colonizing ability, mode of actions and judicious application are likely to facilitate their use as reliable components in the management of sustainable agricultural systems.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenic yeasts from the genus Candida can cause serious infection in humans particularly, in immunocompromised patients and are now recognized as major agents of hospital acquired (nosocomial) infections. In the recent years, there has been a marked increase in the incidence of treatment failures in candidiasis patients receiving long-term antifungal therapy, which has posed a serious problem in its successful use in chemotherapy. Candida cells acquire drug resistance (MDR) during the course of the treatment. The mechanisms of resistance to azole antifungal agents have been elucidated in Candida species and can be mainly categorized as (i) changes in the cell wall or plasma membrane, which lead to impaired drug (azole) uptake; (ii) alterations in the affinity of the drug target Erg11p (lanosterol 14alpha-demethylase) especially to azoles or in the cellular content of Erg11p due to target site mutation or overexpression of the ERG11 gene; and (iii) the efflux of drugs mediated by membrane transport proteins belonging to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, namely CDR1 and CDR2 or to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter, CaMDR1. Many such manifestations are associated with the formation of Candida biofilms including those occurring on devices like indwelling intravascular catheters. Biofilm-associated Candida show uniform resistance to a wide spectrum of antifungal drugs. A combination of different resistance mechanisms is responsible for drug resistance in clinical isolates of Candida species.",

It is currently a worldwide issue that metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) as carbapenem-hydrolyzing enzymes are one of the major drug resistance mechanisms. This investigation is thus aimed to assess the prevalence and characterize the MBL-producing strains of A. baumannii both by phenotypic assays and by genotypic characterization. A total of 73 isolates of A. baumannii were phenotypically and genotypically characterized from patients (N = 1,000) with severe urinary tract infection. Tested strains were subjected to double disc synergy testing (DDST) by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method with imipenem (IMP) and IMP/EDTA combination discs. Plasmid DNA was molecularly screened for MBL-encoding blaIMP, blaVIM, blaGIM, and blaNDM genes by PCR for the genetic relatedness of the MBL genes with carbapenem resistance. Carbapenem resistance profile showed 100%, 45%, and 49% non-susceptibility against imipenem, doripenem, and meropenem, respectively. Altogether 42.46% (n = 31) of the isolates showed MBL production upon double disc phenotypic test with IMP and IMP/EDTA discs. The blaVIM and blaGIM were detected in 34.24% (n = 25) and 16.43% (n = 12) of the isolates, respectively, while the co-occurrence of blaVIM and blaGIM was 2.73% among the isolates. DDST-positive isolates showed 21.19% and 9.58% strains positive for blaVIM and blaGIM, respectively, whereas 1.36% of the strains for both genes. None of the strains yielded blaIMP and blaNDM genes. The findings of this study showed prevalence of carbapenem resistance among A. baumannii from urine samples and the frequency of blaVIM and blaGIM.",

Because of the importance of IL-12 heterodimeric cytokines in microbial infections, autoimmune diseases, and cancers, the authors of this literature discuss about the general characteristics of IL-12 family members, the interactions between IL-12 cytokines and pathogenic microorganisms, the interleukins receptors and their strategies for selecting different signalling pathways. IL-12 and IL-23 are similar in p40 subunits and both are involved in proinflammatory responses while, IL-27 and IL-35 contribute to anti-inflammatory activities; however, IL-27 is also involved in pro-inflammatory responses. There are some similarities and dissimilarities among IL-12 family members which make them a unique bridge between innate and adaptive immune systems. The bioactivities of IL-12 family indicate a brilliant promise for their applications in different fields of medicine. The members of IL-12 family are candidate for several therapeutics including gene therapy, cancer therapy, tumour therapy, and vaccination. To have an accurate diagnostic technique and definite treatment regarding to infectious diseases, the playmakers of IL-12 family as effective criteria together with microarray technology are the best choices for current and future applications.",

Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) has been frequently reported and its spread in Europe is indisputable and poses an enormous threat to hospitalized patients which is of growing concern. This review aims to record prevalence of CRKP in the Balkan region and to review the current knowledge about this life-threatening pathogen. In this review, we summarize data about clinical isolates of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae from Greece, Croatia, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Slovenia, Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Albania from published reports between 2000 and 2023. Among Balkan countries, Greece and Romania are the ones with the most reports about CRKP. Since 2007, KPCs are the dominant carbapenemases in both countries. KPC-2 and NDM-1-producing K. pneumoniae strains have been identified as the most frequent CRKP in Croatia, Bulgaria, Serbia, and Slovenia. OXA-48 enzyme has been identified in most Balkan countries. In addition, since 2018, CRKP sequence type 11 (ST11) seems to have replaced ST258 in Balkan Peninsula, while ST15 continues to thrive throughout the years. Not only efficacy of colistin against CRKP has decreased dramatically during the last ten years but colistin resistance mechanism is based on alterations of chromosomal mgrB gene, rather than the already known mcr genes.Moreover, ceftazidime-avibactam-resistant CRKP were detected mostly in Greece. Emergence of CRKP poses a severe threat to the Balkan countries. Due to the narrow therapeutic window, it is essential to prevent the spread of multiresistant K. pneumoniae strains.",

In this study the whole-genome sequence (WGS) of a carbapenem- and colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae 838Gr strain is presented. This strain was isolated from a urine sample of a patient in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Volos Hospital, Greece. The initial assembly produced 224 contigs with a combined genome size of 5,561,803 bp and a GC content of 57.21%. The K. pneumoniae strain carried IncR, IncFIA, IncC, and repB (R1701) replicons. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis revealed that the isolate belonged to the sequence type 11 (ST11) and serogroup KL24 and O2a. The WGS analysis identified several beta-lactamase genes ( bla TEM-1B , bla CTX-M-15 , bla NDM-1 , bla OXA-1 , bla VEB-1 , bla OXA-10 , and bla SHV-11 ) alongside resistance genes for other antibiotic classes, including floR2, cmlA1, cmlA5, catB3, arr-3, aph(6)-Id, aadA2 . Colistin resistance was attributed to specific point mutations in pmrB (R256G, T140P). This is the first report of a carbapenem- and colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae ST11 strain in Greece. The findings of this study highlight the urgent need for increased surveillance and stringent infection control.",

These compounds are composed of 5-20 amino acids and are generally produced in microheterogeneous mixtures. Peptaibols and peptaibiotics with unusual amino acid content are the result of non-ribosomal biosynthesis. Large multifunctional enzymes known as peptide synthetases assemble these molecules by the multiple carrier thiotemplate mechanism from a remarkable range of precursors, which can be N-methylated, acylated or reduced. Peptaibols and peptaibiotics show interesting physico-chemical and biological properties including the formation of pores in bilayer lipid membranes, as well as antibacterial, antifungal, occasionally antiviral activities, and may elicit plant resistance. The three-dimensional structure of peptaibols and peptaibiotics is characterized predominantly by one type of the helical motifs alpha-helix, 3(10)-helix and beta-bend ribbon spiral. The aim of this review is to summarize the data available about the biosynthesis, biological activity and conformational properties of peptaibols and peptaibiotics described from Trichoderma species.",

In this review a summary will be given about epidemiology, detection and antibiotic resistance of hypervirulent K. pneumoniae. A common feature of hypervirulent K. pneumoniae is a combined expression of several virulence factors. A mucoviscosus phenotype, certain capsulare serotypes (e.g.: K1, K2, K28, K47, K63) together with additional genetic markers namely, magA, rmpA or iucABCD, are needed in combinations to achieve the hypervirulent pathotype. Plasmid coded virulence determinants are also detected, that indicates horizontal gene transfer of hypervirulence factors in K. pneumoniae.Interestingly, infections caused by hypervirulent K. pneumoniae occur usually in the community in otherwise healthy people, and during these infections multiple infection sites are detected. Clinical pictures include both invasive infections and local abscess formation. Pyogenic liver abscess is the most frequently reported clinical manifestation and abscess formation in brain, spleen and lung are also diagnosed. Additionally, meningitis, endophthalmitis, trombophlebitis, pneumonia can also develop.In the early reports, hypervirulent K. pneumoniae strains exhibited enhanced virulence but these were susceptible to commonly used antibiotics. However, recently KPC, VIM, NDM and OXA-48 carbapenemase producing hypervirulent K. pneumoniae strains are increasingly reported, furthermore, well-known high-risk K. pneumoniae clones (e.g.: ST11, ST147, ST307) can develop hypervirulent pathotype, that poses an even more alarming challenge.",

This study reports on the first detection of a pandrug-resistant (PDR) high-risk ST15 K . pneumoniae strain co-producing NDM-1 and VIM-1 in Greece. The isolate was recovered from a blood culture of a male patient admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of Volos Hospital in July 2024. Next generation Sequencing (NGS) confirmed the presence of bla NDM-1 and bla VIM-1 genes. Other beta-lactamase type (CTX-M-15) was detected in association with NDM and VIM enzymes. Furthermore, this isolate was resistant to other antimicrobial agents, including aminoglycosides [ aac(3)-II, aac(3)-IIe, aac(6′)-Ib, aadA1, aph(3″)-Ib, aph(6)-Id, aph(3′)-Ia), chloramphenicol ( catB3 ), fluoroquinolones ( qnrS1 ) and sulfonamides ( sul1 and sul2 ). The Multilocus Sequence Typing revealed that the strain belonged to ST15. According to Kaptive the strain belonged to KL48. Our study provides new data about MBL producing K. pneumoniae in Greece. Thus, we report for the first time the co-expression of bla NDM-1 and bla VIM-1 in our country in ST15 K. pneumoniae . This study provides crucial epidemiological data on MBL-producing K. pneumoniae in Greece and highlights the urgent need for enhanced surveillance, infection control strategies, and access to last-resort antibiotics such as aztreonam-avibactam.",

    "abstract": "It is well documented that the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genomes of certain viruses and the proviral genomes of retroviruses are regularly targeted by epigenetic regulatory mechanisms (DNA methylation, histone modifications, binding of regulatory proteins) in infected cells. In parallel, proteins encoded by viral genomes may affect the activity of a set of cellular promoters by interacting with the very same epigenetic regulatory machinery. This may result in epigenetic dysregulation and subsequent cellular dysfunctions that may manifest in or contribute to the development of pathological changes (e.g. initiation and progression of malignant neoplasms; immunodeficiency). Bacteria infecting mammals may cause diseases in a similar manner, by causing hypermethylation of key cellular promoters at CpG dinucleotides (promoter silencing, e.g. by Campylobacter rectus in the placenta or by Helicobacter pylori in gastric mucosa). I suggest that in addition to viruses and bacteria, other microparasites (protozoa) as well as macroparasites (helminths, arthropods, fungi) may induce pathological changes by epigenetic reprogramming of host cells they are interacting with. Elucidation of the epigenetic consequences of microbe-host interactions (the emerging new field of patho-epigenetics) may have important therapeutic implications because epigenetic processes can be reverted and elimination of microbes inducing patho-epigenetic changes may prevent disease development.",

Except for diet diversity, the breastfeeding status at the enrollment, the exclusive breastfeeding duration, and the introduction of complementary foods did not differ between groups. Distinct microbial signatures were found in IDA patients, with increased relative abundance of Enterobacteriaceae (mean relative abundance, patients vs. controls, 4.4% vs. 3.0%) and Veillonellaceae (13.7% vs. 3.6%), and reduced abundance of Coriobacteriaceae (3.5% vs. 8.8%) compared to healthy controls. A decreased Bifidobacteriaceae/Enterobacteriaceae ratio was observed in IDA patients. Notwithstanding the low sample size, our data highlight microbiota dysbalance in IDA worth for further investigations, aimed at unraveling the ID impact on the microbiome trajectory in early life, and the possible long-term consequences.",

Microbial lipases are the 'working horses' in biocatalysis and have been extensively studied when their exceptionally high stability in non-aqueous media has been discovered. Stability of lipases in organic solvents makes them commercially feasibile in the enzymatic esterification reactions. Their stability is affected by temperature, reaction medium, water concentration and by the biocatalyst's preparation. An optimization process for ester synthesis from pilot scale to industrial scale in the reaction medium is discussed. The water released during the esterification process can be controlled over a wide range and has a profound effect on the activity of the lipases. Approaches to lipase catalysis like protein engineering, directed evolution and metagenome approach were studied. This review reports the recent development in the field of non-aqueous microbial lipase catalysis and factors controlling the esterification/transesterification processes in organic media.",

    "abstract": "Immune cells synthesize, store and secrete hormones, which are identical with the hormones of the endocrine glands. These are: the POMC hormones (ACTH, endorphin), the thyroid system hormones (TRH, TSH, T3), growth hormone (GH), prolactin, melatonin, histamine, serotonin, catecholamines, GnRH, LHRH, hCG, renin, VIP, ANG II. This means that the immune cells contain all of the hormones, which were searched at all and they also have receptors for these hormones. From this point of view the immune cells are similar to the unicells (Tetrahymena), so it can be supposed that these cells retained the properties characteristic at a low level of phylogeny while other cells during the evolution accumulated to form endocrine glands. In contrast to the glandular endocrine cells, immune cells are polyproducers and polyreceivers. As they are mobile cells, they are able to transport the stored hormone to different places (packed transport) or attracted by local factors, accumulate in the neighborhood of the target, synthesizing and secreting hormones locally. This is taking place, e.g. in the case of endorphin, where the accumulating immune cells calms pain caused by the inflammation. The targeted packed transport is more economical than the hormone-pouring to the blood circulation of glandular endocrines and the targeting also cares the other receptor-bearing cells timely not needed the effect. Mostly the immune-effects of immune-cell derived hormones were studied (except endorphin), however, it is not exactly cleared, while the system could have scarcely studied important roles in other cases. The evolutionary aspects and the known as well, as possible roles of immune-endocrine system and their hormones are listed and discussed.",

These components are chemically and functionally very similar to that of mammalian ones. The exogenously given hormones regulate different functions, as movement, phagocytosis, chemotaxis, cell growth, secretion, excretion and the cells’ own hormone production. The receptors are extremely sensitive, certain hormones are sensed (and response is provoked) at 10 −21 M concentration, which makes likely that the function could work by the effect of hormones produced by the Tetrahymena itself. The signal reception is selective, it can differentiate between closely related hormones. The review is listing the hormones produced by the Tetrahymena , the receptors which can receive signals and the signal pathways and second messengers as well, as the known effects of mammalian hormones to the life functions of Tetrahymena . The possible and justified role of hormonal system in the Tetrahymena as a single cell and inside the Tetrahymena population, as a community is discussed.

However, later it is populated by bone marrow originated lymphatic elements and forms a combined organ, which is a central part of the immune system as well as an influential element of the endocrine orchestra. Thymus produces self-hormones (thymulin, thymosin, thymopentin, and thymus humoral factor), which are participating in the regulation of immune cell transformation and selection, and also synthesizes hormones similar to that of the other endocrine glands such as melatonin, neuropeptides, and insulin, which are transported by the immune cells to the sites of requests (packed transport). Thymic (epithelial and immune) cells also have receptors for hormones which regulate them. This combined organ, which is continuously changing from birth to senescence seems to be a pacemaker of life. This function is basically regulated by the selection of self-responsive thymocytes as their complete destruction helps the development (up to puberty) and their gradual release in case of weakened control (after puberty) causes the erosion of cells and intercellular material, named aging. This means that during aging, self-destructive and non-protective immune activities are manifested under the guidance of the involuting thymus, causing the continuous irritation of cells and organs. Possibly the pineal body is the main regulator of the pacemaker, the neonatal removal of which results in atrophy of thymus and wasting disease and its later corrosion causes the insufficiency of thymus. The co-involution of pineal and thymus could determine the aging and the time of death without external intervention; however, external factors can negatively influence both of them.",

    "abstract": "Quorum sensing (QS) is the chemical communication processes between bacteria, which may be inter-genus or intra-genus. In general, several physiological functions, such as nutrient uptake, competence development, biofilm formation, sporulation, and toxin secretion, are accomplished through QS process. The QS (cell density-dependent process) circuit in Gram-positive bacteria consists mainly of two parts: an inducer molecule and a receptor protein. The binding of inducer molecule to receptor activates the target gene, which then performs the necessary function in bacteria. In the past few years, several investigations have been conducted to explore the QS circuit in various bacteria, but still this information is insufficient to fully understand the bacterial gene expression cascade. In the present review, we summarize the QS architecture and their associated gene regulation in four Gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus , and Streptococcus pneumoniae . It is well established that S. aureus, B. cereus , and S. pneumoniae are potent human pathogen. A detailed understanding of QS circuit in these bacteria would be useful in preparation of customized medicine in future. Whereas, B. subtilis is an industrially important candidate and has been used in several biotechnology sectors. Understanding of QS circuit in B. subtilis will definitely enrich the antibiotics and enzyme industries.",

In response to challenge with microbes or microbial-derived substances the activation and nuclear translocation of NF-kB, the production of nitric oxide (NO) and inflammatory cytokines occur in keratinocytes, in a TLR-dependent manner. Blocking of NF-kB activation or NO production inhibit the Candida albicans-killing activity of keratinocytes. This Candida killing activity could be inhibited by blocking of KcMR. Recognition of invading pathogens in the epidermis triggers cytokine production in keratinocytes leading to elimination of pathogens and the activation of the adaptive immune system. These findings stress the importance of the role of keratinocytes in innate immunity.",

Therefore, an exhaustive microbial analysis of honey, adult honey-bee gastrointestinal tract, and pollen from different Slovakian regions and different seasons, was conducted. Microbial screening revealed that the primary sources of microbial community present in Slovakian honey are pollen and the honey-bees' digestive tract microflora, containing microorganisms normally present in dust, air and flowers. We found that the digestive tract of Slovakian adult honey-bees is highly populated by anaerobic, rather than aerobic bacteria, where coliforms, enterococci, staphylococci, Bacillus sp., Pseudomonas sp., microscopic fungi and yeast were found. Interestingly, statistical differences were found between the microflora of the gastrointestinal tract of summer and winter bees. Pollen revealed the presence of mesophil anaerobic and aerobic microorganisms, coliforms and microscopic fungi. Among these, the most representative genera were Alternaria, Cladosporium and Penicillium . In honey the counts of total anaerobic and total aerobic bacteria, that of coliforms, enterococci, bacilli, microscopic fungi and yeasts were monitored. Most frequently microscopic fungi belonging to genera Penicillium, Cladosporium and Alternaria were found.",

    "abstract": "Anti-microbial peptides (AMPs) were originally thought to exert protecting actions against bacterial infection by disintegrating bacterial membranes. Upon identification of internal bacterial targets, the view changed and moved toward inhibition of prokaryote-specific biochemical processes. However, the level of none of these activities can explain the robust efficacy of some of these peptides in animal models of systemic and cutaneous infections. A rapidly growing panel of reports suggests that AMPs, now called host-defense peptides (HDPs), act through activating the immune system of the host. This includes recruitment and activation of macrophages and mast cells, inducing chemokine production and altering NF-κB signaling processes. As a result, both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses are elevated together with activation of innate and adaptive immunity mechanisms, wound healing, and apoptosis. HDPs sterilize the systemic circulation and local injury sites significantly more efficiently than pure single-endpoint in vitro microbiological or biochemical data would suggest and actively aid recovering from tissue damage after or even without bacterial infections. However, the multiple and, often opposing, immunomodulatory functions of HDPs require exceptional care in therapeutic considerations.",

A total of 88 consecutive, non-duplicated E. coli ( n = 65) and K. pneumoniae ( n = 23) isolates showing resistance or intermediate resistance to amikacin and/or gentamicin were collected between October 2013 and May 2015 from clinical samples received at Gaziantep Dr. Ersin Arslan Training and Research Hospital. Seventeen isolates were obtained from Syrian patients. Isolates resistant to any of the two aminoglycosides were tested by PCR for seven AME genes, and 22 isolates with amikacin MIC ≥16 mg/L were also tested for 16S rRNA methylase genes. In E. coli isolates, the most frequent genes were aac(6′)-Ib (50 strains; 76.9%) and aac(3)-IIa (40 strains; 70.7%), followed by aph(3′)-Ia (5 strains; 7.6%) and ant(2″)-Ia (2 strains; 3.1%).

Identification of the isolated strains was performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of seven antibiotics was determined by agar dilution method. The presence of cfiA, ermF, and nim genes was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Correlations between the presence of resistance genes and the MIC values of antibiotics were determined using the Pearson correlation coefficient. In the identification process, 214 isolates (67.7%) were identified as B. fragilis, 52 (16.4%) as Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, 17 (5.4%) as Bacteroides ovatus, 12 (3.8%) as Bacteroides uniformis, 10 (3.2%) as Phocaeicola vulgatus (=Bacteroides vulgatus), 7 (2.2%) as Bacteroides stercoris, and 4 (1.3%) as Parabacteroides distasonis. The presence of cfiA gene moderately correlated with the MIC of imipenem and meropenem (r = 0.34 and r = 0.42, respectively), while resistance to clindamycin and the presence of ermF gene exhibited a very strong correlation (r = 0.72). In the current study, the most active antimicrobial agents against B. fragilis group bacteria were found to be meropenem, imipenem, metronidazole, and piperacillin/tazobactam; however, resistance to clindamycin renders its empirical use inappropriate.",

This study endeavors to suggest the importance of early diagnosis and treatment related to central nervous system (CNS) aspergillosis. Recognizing the typical and atypical imaging characteristics of CNS aspergillosis enables the early and aggressive treatment of an otherwise rapidly fatal infection. We reported a case of an elderly patient with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and prostate cancer who underwent repeated chemotherapy and subsequently experienced a sudden disturbance of consciousness. The diagnosis was affirmed through metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of sputum and cerebrospinal fluid. The treatment encompassed systemic antifungal agents and intrathecal injection of amphotericin B. Metagenomic sequencing of sputum and cerebrospinal fluid detected Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus flavus , leading to a diagnosis of invasive pulmonary and CNS aspergillosis. Although the patient actively received combined systemic antifungal drugs (voriconazole and amphoteric B liposome) and intrathecal injection of amphotericin B, he ultimately succumbed to the infection. A review of similar cases from PubMed and Medline from 2014 to 2024, encompassing 64 patients, showed that while early diagnosis and combination therapy have improved survival rates, outcomes remain suboptimal. Invasive aspergillosis has a high mortality rate and requires early diagnosis and treatment. Metagenomic sequencing of pathogenic microorganisms constitutes a convenient approach to facilitate the early diagnosis of aspergillosis. Voriconazole is the preferred treatment for invasive aspergillosis. When CNS aspergillosis emerges, it might be necessary to combine other systemic antifungal agents with intrathecal injection of amphotericin B.",

This situation has been further aggravated by the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains, with some notable examples such as extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC), due to their impact on the healthcare sector, causing difficult-to-treat infections. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of ESBL-EC and their antibiotic resistance patterns in chicken meat sold in Tamaulipas, Mexico. A total of 130 chicken meat samples from 17 municipalities in Tamaulipas were analyzed during 2024. An average prevalence of 20.7% of ESBL-EC was detected. Thirty-eight different antibiotic resistance patterns were identified, and 85.1% were multidrug-resistant (MDR). When classifying the strains into phylogroups, 63.8% were considered commensal (groups A and B1) and 36.1% pathogenic (groups B2 and D). The results of this study demonstrate the presence of pathogenic MDR ESBL-EC strains in chicken meat sold in Tamaulipas, suggesting possible improper handling of this meat, which may pose a risk to consumers. These results also emphasize the need to monitor the presence of antibiotic resistant strains in chicken meat and other foods sold in Mexico.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Stenotrophomonas maltophilia has emerged as an opportunistic pathogen originating from the environments, causing nosocomial infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals and patients with cystic fibrosis. Although this microorganism exhibits low virulence, its infections are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. S. maltophilia is intrinsically resistant to many antimicrobial agents used in clinical practices, therefore, posing significant treatment challenges. The multidrug resistance in S. maltophilia results from a combination of intrinsic, adaptive, and acquired mechanisms. S. maltophilia genome carries an array of genes encoding multidrug efflux pumps, which are key contributors to its broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance by expelling a wide range of drugs and reducing their intracellular concentrations to nontoxic levels. The majority of these efflux pumps belong to the resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) family, while a lesser fraction is classified under the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) and the adenosine triphosphate binding cassette (ABC) family. In terms of function, substrate specificity, and complex gene regulation, these multidrug efflux pumps contribute not only to the survival of S. maltophilia under antibiotic stress but also to its resilience against other chemical challenges, including oxidative stress-generating substances and biocides. The roles of certain efflux pump systems in acquired and adaptive antibiotic resistance, as well as their potential applications as drug targets to enhance the efficacy of routinely used antibiotics through the use of small molecules capable of functioning as efflux pump inhibitors, are also discussed. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms can contribute to the more effective management against antibiotic-resistant S. maltophilia .",

The dominant carbapenemase genes were bla NDM-1 (45.9%), bla KPC-2 (18.9%), and bla VIM-1 (27.0%), with co-expression of multiple carbapenemases in 30% of the isolates. MLST revealed the high-risk clones ST11, ST15, and ST323, and three intra-intensive care unit (ICU) transmission clusters. The emergence of dual-carbapenemase and colistin-resistant clones underscores the need for local genomic surveillance, improved infection control, and access to newer antimicrobials in non-tertiary settings.",

    "abstract": "Cellulolytic, xylanolytic, chitinolytic and beta-1,3-glucanolytic enzyme systems of species belonging to the filamentous fungal genus Trichoderma have been investigated in details and are well characterised. The ability of Trichoderma strains to produce extracellular proteases has also been known for a long time, however, the proteolytic enzyme system is relatively unknown in this genus. Fortunately, in the recent years more and more attention is focused on the research in this field. The role of Trichoderma proteases in the biological control of plant pathogenic fungi and nematodes has been demonstrated, and it is also suspected that they may be important for the competitive saprophytic ability of green mould isolates and may represent potential virulence factors of Trichoderma strains as emerging fungal pathogens of clinical importance. The aim of this review is to summarize the information available about the extracellular proteases of Trichoderma. Numerous studies are available about the extracellular proteolytic enzyme profiles of Trichoderma strains and about the effect of abiotic environmental factors on protease activities. A number of protease enzymes have been purified to homogeneity and some protease encoding genes have been cloned and characterized. These results will be reviewed and the role of Trichoderma proteases in biological control as well as their advantages and disadvantages in biotechnology will be discussed.",

    "abstract": "Ten different strains of Thermomyces lanuginosus , isolated from composting soils were found to produce phytase when grown on PSM medium. The wild type strain CM was found to produce maximum amount of phytase (4.33 units/g DW substrate). Culturing T. lanuginosus strain CM on medium containing wheat bran and optimizing other culture conditions (carbon source, media type, nitrogen source, level of nitrogen, temperature, pH, inoculum age, inoculum level and moisture), increased the phytase yield to 13.26 units/g substrate. This culture was further subjected to UV mutagenesis for developing phytase hyperproducing mutants. The mutant (TL-7) showed 2.29-fold increase in phytase activity as compared to the parental strain. Employing Box-Behnken factor factorial design of response surface methodology resulted in optimized phytase production (32.19 units/g of substrate) by mutant TL-7. A simple two-step purification (40.75-folds) of phytase from mutant TL-7 was achieved by anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. The purified phytase (∼54 kDa) was characterized to be optimally active at pH 5.0 and temperature 70 °C, though the enzyme showed ∼70% activity over a wide pH and temperature range (2.0–10.0 and 30–90 °C, respectively). The phytase showed broad substrate specificity with activity against sodium phytate, ADP and riboflavin phosphate. The phytase from T. lanuginosus was thermoacidstable as it showed up to 70% residual activity after exposure to 70 °C at pH 3.0 for 120 min. The enzyme showed K m 4.55 μM and V max 0.833 μM/min/mg against sodium phytate as substrate.",

The Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method and the phenotypic disk confirmatory test were performed for each isolate. The total of 206 isolates including 106 E. coli and 100 K. pneumoniae were collected of which 122 isolates (59.2%) were ESBL positive. The prevalence of ESBL-producing strains was 59.2% (122/206). All the isolates were susceptible to imipenem. Among the ESBL-producing isolates, the sensitivity was from 3.3% to 61.5% for ampicillin to aztreonam. From female isolates (136), 59.5% and from male isolates (70), 58.6% were ESBL-producers. Ratios of isolates from hospitalized patients to out-patients were 94/28 in the ESBL-producing group. The number of ESBL-producing isolates according to the isolation sites showed a significant difference between ESBL-producers and non-producers in blood samples ( P <0.05). This study shows that the prevalence of ESBL strains in Iran is high. It seems necessary for clinicians and medical community personnel to be fully aware of ESBL-producing microorganisms.",

    "abstract": "Hormonal imprinting is an epigenetic process which is taking place perinatally at the first encounter between the developing hormone receptors and their target hormones. The hormonal imprinting influences the binding capacity of receptors, the hormone synthesis of the cells, and other hormonally regulated functions, as sexual behavior, aggressivity, empathy, etc. However, during the critical period, when the window for imprinting is open, molecules similar to the physiological imprinters as synthetic hormone analogs, other members of the hormone families, environmental pollutants, etc. can cause faulty imprinting with life-long consequences. The developing immune system, the cells of which also have receptors for hormones, is very sensitive to faulty imprinting, which causes alterations in the antibody and cytokine production, in the ratio of immune cells, in the defense against bacterial and viral infections as well as against malginant tumors. Immune cells (lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes and mast cells) are also producing hormones which are secreted into the blood circulation as well as are transported locally (packed transport). This process is also disturbed by faulty imprinting. As immune cells are differentiating during the whole life, faulty imprinting could develop any time, however, the most decisive is the perinatal imprinting. The faulty imprinting is inherited to the progenies in general and especially in the case of immune system. In our modern world the number and amount of arteficial imprinters (e.g. endocrine disruptors and drugs) are enormously increasing. The effects of the faulty imprinters most dangerous to the immune system are shown in the paper. The present and future consequences of the flood of faulty imprintings are unpredictable however, it is discussed.",

After neonatal pinealectomy the thymus has been destroyed and wasting disease developed. Since that time a flood of experiments justified the observation and pointed to the prominent role of pineal in the regulation of the immune system. Melatonin, the hormone of the pineal gland stimulates immune processes acting to the immune cells' cytokine production, the haemopoiesis, and immune cell-target cell interactions. Melatonin receptors have been demonstrated and their localization and function were justified. Melatonin production by and melatonin receptors on (and in) the immune cells was proved. Melatonin agonists have been synthesized and the use of melatonin as adjuvant in the therapy of diseases connected to the immune system (cancers included) has been started. The paper summarizes the most important studies and discusses the interrelations of the data. The discussion points to the possibility of packed transport of the pineal hormone by the immune cells and to the adventages of local regulation by this transport.",

These affect mostly immunocompromised hosts and generally lead to soft tissue, and urinary tract infections. Bacteremia most commonly develop secondary to soft tissue or catheter related infections and may lead rarely to mortality. Myroides spp. are generally suscetible to fluoroquinolones, piperacillin/tazobactam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, carbapenems or tetracyclines however, pan-resistant isolates and multiple resistance genes have been reported in clinical isolates of Myroides spp. We report a pan-resistant Myroides odoratimimus bacteremia in a patient with severe COVID-19 ending with fatality and in this context a review of reported Myroides bacteremias are also described. In this study, a 64-year old male patient with history of coronary artery bypass was admitted to ICU with severe COVID-19 pneumonia accompanied by pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium. Continous renal replacement therapy and extracorporeal membraneous-oxygenation were initiated due to acute renal failure and persistent hypercarbia/hypoxia, respectively. Within four weeks of hospitalization various episodes of bacteremia developed and multiple antibiotics were used. On the 5 th week of follow-up, acute phase reactants increased and empirical broad spectrum antibiotics were initiated. Blood culture revealed Gram-negative rods. The patient became hypotensive and despite maximum medical care he was lost due to cardiac arrest. M. odoratimimus was identified by MALDI-TOF and the bacterium was pan-resistant. According to Center for Genomic Epidemiology results the strain was identified as M. odoratimimus PR63039 and the genome analysis revealed antibiotic resistance genes associated with resistance to beta-lactams ( bla OXA-347 , bla MUS-1 , bla EBR-1 ), tetracyclines ( tetX ), sulfonamides ( sul2 ), macrolides ( ereD ), ( ermF ).",

Antibiotic resistance was determined by disk diffusion and broth dilution methods. Detection of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) and AmpCs was performed using phenotypic tests. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was applied to detect the ESBL, AmpC, and integron genes. Analysis of AmpC and cassette arrays of integron genes was performed using DNA sequencing. Plasmids were analyzed by PCR-based replicon typing and conjugation. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were applied to explore the genomic relatedness among the isolates. The highest levels of resistance were observed against ampicillin (100%), followed by piperacillin (57.5%), ceftazidime (46%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (44%), ciprofloxacin (32.5%), and imipenem (19%). Approximately, 66.5% of isolates harbored at least one of the beta-lactamase genes (blaTEM, blaSHV, blaCTX-M, and blaOXA-1). In addition, 22.5% of isolates carried at least one of the AmpC genes including blaDHA and blaCIT. Integron class I was the most prevalent integron among resistant isolates.

All selected isolates were able to transfer blaCTX-M, also two isolates transferred the blaDHA-1 gene to Escherichia coli K12 through conjugation. Finally, 21 isolates were categorized into 4 pulsotypes and 11 unique clusters in PFGE. MLST identified ST147 and ST11 sequence types but ST147 was the most prevalent in the current study.",

    "abstract": "Liver fibrosis (LF), where the chronic HCV infection is a major cause, is a characteristic of chronic liver diseases. LF results from chronic damage to the liver in conjunction with the accumulation of ECM proteins. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their specific inhibitors (TIMPs) are thought to play an essential role in the hepatic lesions. The available data concerning the circulating levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) in chronic hepatitis C are not conclusive. Therefore, the present study was designed to seek the relationship between serum MMP-9, and TIMP-1 to liver status in chronic liver disease in fifty patients divided into three groups (chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma). MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were analyzed by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results showed that the lowest serum level of MMP-9 was found in chronic hepatitis patients compared to the control ( P < 0.05). Serum MMP-9 is decreasing during progression of chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis showing the least level in the cirrhotic group. Serum TIMP-1 was significantly higher in the cirrhotic group compared to chronic hepatitis ( P < 0.05) and controls ( P < 0.001). MMP-9 was negatively correlated to both TIMP-1 and the histological severity in chronic hepatitis. There was a positive correlation between TIMP-1 and the degree of fibrosis (r = 0.73, P < 0.001). Lastly, there was a statistically significant increase of MMP-9 ( P < 0.001) and TIMP-1 ( P < 0.05) in HCC patients compared with the other groups. In conclusion, these findings raise the possibility of using serum TIMP-1 as a non-invasive assay in liver fibrosis. Further, the altered balance between circulating MMP-9 and TIMP-1 during HCV infection may play an important role in aggravating liver injury progression in chronic liver diseases.",

Susceptibility of these isolates to antimicrobial agents including gentamicin and amikacin was determined by E-test. Aminoglycoside resistant isolates were then tested by PCR for AME genes, including aphA6, aacC1, aacC2, aacA4, aadB, aadA1 , classes 1 integron, 5′-CS-3′ and typed by RAPD PCR.The rate of resistance to imipenem, meropenem, gentamicin and amikacin were 39%, 39%, 38% and 32%, respectively. Intermediate resistance phenotype to gentamicin and amikacin was observed in 2% and 5% of all the isolates, respectively. After aph 6 with 90% (n = 36/40), aad A1, aac C1 and aad B with 82.5% (n = 33/40), 65% (n = 26/40) and 20% (n = 8/40) were the most prevalent AME genes among aminoglycosides resistant A. baumannii isolates. A combination of two to four different resistance genes was observed in 39 of 40 strains (97.5%), with a total of 7 different combinations. PCR of integrase genes revealed that AME gene was associated with 67% of class 1 integrons. RAPD analysis showed three predominant genotypes A (n = 20), B (n = 10) and 10 unrelated genotypes.The occurrence of identical resistance genes, gene combinations and class 1 integrons associated with these genes in clonally distinct strains indicates that horizontal gene transfer plays a major role in the dissemination of aminoglycoside resistance in A. baumannii .",

We comparatively investigated the in vitro antibacterial effect of S53P4 bioactive glass (BAG) and gentamicin impregnated PMMA beads. Bacterial viability was assessed hourly by Standard Plate Count during 24 hours of incubation, by determining the number of colony forming units (CFU) of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae . Both tested materials showed an antibacterial effect on all studied bacteria. In case of S. aureus , BAG granules were almost as effective as gentamicin impregnated PMMA beads, with no statistically significant differences. In contrast, PMMA beads had a superior antibacterial effect on S. epidermidis and K. pneumoniae . The antibacterial effect of BAG was greatly influenced by granule size and contact time. There was a statistically significant correlation between pH values and the number of CFU in the case of S53P4 BAG granules. As a biocompatible and biodegradable bone substitute, S53P4 bioactive glass can be a good alternative in the local management of osteomyelitis.",

Cervical and blood samples were collected from 176 infertile women and 45 pregnant women in the third trimester. Classical methods and real time PCR were applied to each cervical sample to detect the presence of these sexually transmitted microorganisms; the ELISA method was applied to blood samples to detect C. trachomatis antibodies (IgA, IgM and IgG). The proportion of C. trachomatis IgG was significantly higher in the infertile group (23.8%) than in the pregnant group (4.4%), p < 0.05. For C. trachomatis antigen (Ag) and N. gonorrhoeae Ag no differences were observed between the two groups. The prevalence of mycoplasma genital infections was higher in the pregnant group (U. urealyticum — 53.3% and M. hominis — 20%) than in the infertile group (U. urealyticum — 39.7% and M. hominis — 7.3%). Higher rate of co-infection with C. trachomatis and mycoplasma were observed among the infertile women (25.7%) than among the pregnant women (7.7%). This combination could be involved in the appearance of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and its sequela, including infertility. C. trachomatis IgG determination still remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of PID and should be used as a screening test for the prediction of tubal damage in infertile women. In view of the large number of cases involving the co-existence of genital infections with C. trachomatis, M. hominis and U. urealyticum, it is clearly necessary to perform screening for all three microorganisms among all women of reproductive age but especially those who are infertile.",

There are interhormone actions between the amines, and between the amines and other hormones produced by Tetrahymena. The critical review discusses the role of amines in the early stages of evolution and compares this to their functions in mammals.

Stilbenes are polyphenol compounds of plant origin known to possess a variety of pharmacological properties, such as antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal effects. This study reports the in vitro growth-inhibitory potential of eight naturally occurring stilbenes against six standard strains and two clinical isolates of S. aureus , using a broth microdilution method, and expressing the results as minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Pterostilbene (MICs = 32–128 μg/ml), piceatannol (MICs = 64–256 μg/ml), and pinostilbene (MICs = 128 μg/ml) are among the active compounds that possess the strongest activity against all microorganisms tested, followed by 3′-hydroxypterostilbene, isorhapontigenin, oxyresveratrol, and rhapontigenin with MICs 128–256 μg/ml. Resveratrol (MIC = 256 μg/ml) exhibited only weak inhibitory effect. Furthermore, structure–activity relationships were studied. Hydroxyl groups at ortho-position (B-3′ and -4′) played crucial roles for the inhibitory effect of hydroxystilbene piceatannol. Compounds with methoxy groups at ring A (3′-hydroxypterostilbene, pinostilbene, and pterostilbene) produced stronger effect against S. aureus than their analogues (isorhapontigenin and rhapontigenin) with methoxy groups at ring B. These findings provide arguments for further investigation of stilbenes as prospective leading structures for development of novel antistaphylococcal agents for topical treatment of skin infections.",

In this review, we summarized the current knowledge of POAG and commensal microbiota, combined with several lines of evidence in PD and AD to propose a possible hypothesis for POAG pathogenesis: microorganisms cause glaucoma via gut–retina axis, resulting in autoantibodies and autoreactive T cells that lead to autoimmunity. Furthermore, dual-hit hypothesis, an example of a commensal pathogen that causes PD, was partially exported in POAG. Finally, future perspectives are suggested to expand understanding of POAG.",

    "abstract": "Endocrine disruptors (EDs) are bound by steroid receptors, have steroid-like effects, and by this, negatively influence hormone-regulated processes. Phytoestrogens, which are consumed in enormously high amount by man, are also EDs; however, in contrast to industrial or communal EDs, in some cases have beneficial effects. As immune cells have steroid (first of all, estrogen) nuclear and plasma membrane receptors, which bind phytostrogens (genistein, daidzein, etc.), the development, lifespan, and function of them are deeply influenced by phytoestrogens. They can provoke perinatal faulty hormonal imprinting with lifelong consequences. However, faulty imprinting can be developed not only perinatally but also in other critical periods of life, as weaning, adolescence, and even in continuously dividing cells (e.g., hemopoietic cells) during the whole life. This means that the phytoestrogens could cause direct – instant or long-lasting – steroid effects and durable imprinting effects. As the effect of hormonal imprinting is epigenetically inherited, the phytoestrogen’s effects appear in the progeny generations, and the generationally repeated disruptor effects will be different from the present ones. This could also be manifested in the amount, type, and appearance of autoimmune diseases. The consumption of soy is enormously growing, and its immune effect is extended. As the immune system influences basic physiological processes, it seems likely that evolutionary alterations will be observed. In this case, some phytoestrogens will be needed for the normal life of man, as it happened in the case of vitamins A and D, which are already life-important exohormones. However, quantitatively or qualitatively enormous amount of phytoestrogens will cause pathological and epigenetically inherited alterations.",

The presence of efflux pump-encoding genes, i.e. mexA , mexC , mexE , and mexY , was assessed using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique in 48 carbapenem-resistant and MDR P. aeruginosa strains. Real-time reverse transcription PCR was employed to evaluate the expression levels of mexA , mexC , mexE , and mexY genes. All 48 carbapenem-resistant and MDR P. aeruginosa strains harbored efflux pump-encoding genes including mexA , mexC , mexE , and mexY according to the PCR results. Overexpression of the MexAB-OprM, MexCD-OprJ, MexEF-OprN, and MexXY-OprM efflux pumps was detected in 75% ( n = 36), 83.3% ( n = 40), 10.4% ( n = 5) and 41.6% ( n = 20) of the clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa, respectively. This study revealed that the presence and overexpression of efflux pumps are associated with the emergence of carbapenem-resistant and MDR P. aeruginosa strains. Therefore, research on efflux pump inhibitors of P. aeruginosa will be a worthwhile endeavor to increase the clinical efficiency of available antibiotics and prevent ensuing treatment failure.",

    "abstract": "Globally, the spread of carbapenem-resistant strains has limited treatment options for multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. This study aimed to determine the role of point mutations as well as the expression level of the oprD gene in the emergence of imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa strains isolated from patients referred to Ardabil hospitals. A total of 48 imipenem-resistant clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa collected between June 2019 and January 2022 were used in this study. Detection of the oprD gene and its amino acid alterations was performed using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing techniques. The expression level of the oprD gene in imipenem-resistant strains was determined using the real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) method. All imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa strains were positive for the oprD gene based on the PCR results, and also five selected isolates indicated one or more amino acid alterations. Detected amino acid alterations in the OprD porin were Ala210Ile, Gln202Glu, Ala189Val, Ala186Pro, Leu170Phe, Leu127Val, Thr115Lys, and Ser103Thr. Based on the RT-PCR results, the oprD gene was downregulated in 79.1% of imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa strains. However, 20.9% of strains showed overexpression of the oprD gene. Probably, resistance to imipenem in these strains is associated with the presence of carbapenemases, AmpC cephalosporinase, or efflux pumps. Owing to the high prevalence of imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa strains due to various resistance mechanisms in Ardabil hospitals, the implementation of surveillance programs to reduce the spread of these resistant microorganisms along with rational selection and prescription of antibiotics is recommended.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The intestinal microbiota is a microenvironment that has been the subject of studies for several decades. Over time, it has been reconsidered as a possible cofactor of multiple acute and chronic human diseases. In fact, alterations of the intestinal bacterial flora have been found in various neurological diseases. There are three modes of interaction between the intestinal microbiota and the gut-brain-axis: chemical signals, neural pathways and immune system. Even at the gastrointestinal level, the gut microbiota plays certainly an important role in the etiopathogenesis of chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases but also in irritable bowel syndrome. An important correlation has also been demonstrated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, as well as in other metabolic, cardiovascular and oncological diseases. Bacteria, viruses, fungi and various microorganisms that normally reside in our intestines can also be called into question as protective factors against these diseases. All this evidence leads researchers to consider the gut microbiota as a key element in the determination of aforementioned diseases. Therefore, it would be foreseeable in the future to associate the use of probiotics with the therapies used in the treatment of all these diseases. In this review we have condensed the main current knowledge regarding the link between the most frequent diseases and the gut microbiota.",

Microsporum sp. — AP 1 and T. mentagrophytes — AP 5 survived heat treatment at 90 °C but exhibited best mycelial growth at 30 °C (with 53.41 mg/50 ml biomass dry weight) and 40 °C (with 61.32 mg/50 ml biomass dry weight) respectively, after incubation for 2 weeks. Trichophyton rubrum — AP 4 and Epidermophyton sp. — AP 2 could not survive heat treatment at 90 °C but grew better at 40 °C (with 38.52 mg/50 ml biomass dry weight) and 30 °C (with 48.32 mg/50 ml biomass dry weight) respectively, over the same incubation period, while C. albicans — AP 3 grew better at 30 °C with 38.7 mg/50 ml biomass dry weight after 2 weeks, but failed to survive at 70 °C. All the isolates except Candida albicans — AP 3 survived at 80 °C and exhibited great potential to elaborate keratinolytic enzymes, with T. mentagrophytes demonstrating the best potential at 30 °C and 40 °C. Higher temperatures tended to reduce keratinolytic activities and there were significant (P <0.05) relationships between biomass weight and enzyme productivities of all the isolates except T. mentagrophytes . This indicates that in some dermatophytes keratinolytic proteinase activity is not a function of cell multiplicity. This plus the high thermostability of the enzymes are important attributes in the consideration of preventive and therapeutic methods against dermatophytes in the tropics.",

    "abstract": "In yeast the Protein Kinase A (PKA) pathway can be activated by a variety of nutrients. Fermentable sugars, like glucose and sucrose, trigger a spike in the cAMP level, followed by activation of PKA and phosphorylation of target proteins causing a.o. mobilization of reserve carbohydrates, repression of stress-related genes and induction of growth-related genes. Glucose and sucrose are sensed by a G-protein coupled receptor system that activates adenylate cyclase and also activates a bypass pathway causing direct activation of PKA. Addition of other essential nutrients, like nitrogen sources or phosphate, to glucose-repressed nitrogen-or phosphate-starved cells, also triggers rapid activation of the PKA pathway. In these cases cAMP is not involved as a second messenger. Amino acids are sensed by the Gap1 transceptor, previously considered only as an amino acid transporter. Recent results indicate that the amino acid ligand has to induce a specific conformational change for signaling. The same amino acid binding site is involved in transport and signaling. Similar results have been obtained for Pho84 which acts as a transceptor for phosphate activation of the PKA pathway. Ammonium activation of the PKA pathway in nitrogen-starved cells is mediated mainly by the Mep2 transceptor, which belongs to a different class of transporter proteins. Hence, different types of sensing systems are involved in control of the yeast PKA pathway by nutrients.",

    "abstract": "Azospirillum bioinoculant is well known for its high nitrogen fixing and plant growth promoting characters. The carrier based bioinoculants generally suffer from shorter shelf life, poor quality, high contamination and low field performance. Therefore, it is necessary to develop alternative new formulation of inoculants where cyst based inoculants can play significant role. The cyst based liquid formulation was developed by inoculating Azospirillum into the cyst inducing minimal salts medium (MSM). One hundred per cent conversion of vegetative cells into cyst cells was noticed in 96 h. The survival of cyst cells in the MSM was observed up to one year and two months and interestingly, the population level of 10 8 was maintained till the final observation. The cyst cells of Azospirillum accumulated poly- β -hydroxybutyrate (PHB) granules and exhibited desiccation tolerance up to 20 days and temperature tolerance up to 40 °C. Thus the cyst based liquid formulation has twin advantage of longer shelf life and tolerance to harmful environmental conditions. Regeneration of cyst cells into vegetative cells in different media viz., tap water, sterile water, rice gruel and nutrient broth was studied. The changes started within 3 h and complete return of vegetative cells was observed at 24 h. Although all the media tested favoured regeneration, comparatively quicker regeneration was observed in nutrient broth and followed by rice gruel. Thus, cyst based liquid formulation of Azospirillum has all the survival advantages and can be used as a potential bioinoculant.",

    "abstract": "The sharp increase of life expectancy and the increasing ratio of ageing population pose new challenges for the public health system. The elderly suffer from more frequent and severe infections than young people. Theoretically, vaccination could protect the elderly against several infectious diseases, but due to their age-related immune impairment, vaccination might fail in many cases. Instead of ineffective vaccination campaigns, exploration and restoration of age-dependent dysregulation of their immune functions have to be placed into the focus of recent research. Frequent comorbidities in these people augment immune defects. Immunosenescence affects both the innate and adaptive immunity. Disturbances in macrophage-derived cytokine release and reduction of the natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity lead to increased frequency of respiratory, gastrointestinal and skin infections. Although the humoral immunity retains most of its original activity through life span, ageing dampens the ability of B cells to produce antibodies against novel antigens. Age-related declination of the cellular immunity is the consequence of thymic atrophy, reduced output of new T lymphocytes, accumulation of anergic memory cells, deficiencies in the cytokine production and uncertain antigen presentation. Persistent infection by different herpesviruses and other parasites contribute to the loss of immunosurveillance and premature exhaustion of T cells.",

However, the antibacterial activities against skin pathogens and anti-inflammatory effects of the essential oils of Citrus sunki (JinGyul) and Fortunella japonica var. margarita (GumGyul) have not yet been described. Therefore, in this study, the essential oils of the citrus species C. sunki (CSE) and F. japonica var. margarita (FJE), both native to the island of Jeju, Korea, were examined for their anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities against skin pathogens. Four human skin pathogenic microorganisms, Staphylococcus epidermidis CCARM 3709, Propionibacterium acnes CCARM 0081, Malassezia furfur KCCM 12679, and Candida albicans KCCM 11282, were studied. CSE and FJE exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against most of the pathogenic bacteria and yeast strains that were tested. Interestingly, CSE and FJE even showed antimicrobial activity against antibiotic-resistant S. epidermidis CCARM 3710, S. epidermidis CCARM 3711, P. acnes CCARM9009, and P. acnes CCARM9010 strains. In addition, CSE and FJE reduced the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced secretion of nitric oxide (NO) in RAW 264.7 cells, indicating that they have anti-inflammatory effects. We also analysed the chemical composition of the oils by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and identified several major components, including dl-limonene (68.18%) and β-myrcene (4.36%) for CSE, and dl-limonene (61.58%) and carvone (6.36%) for FJE. Taken together, these findings indicate that CSE and FJE have great potential to be used in human skin health applications.",

The average incidence rate of MRSA in Tehran was found to be over 40%. A total of 140 MRSA isolates obtained from patients attending a teaching hospital in Tehran, from May 2009 to December 2009, were included in this study. The antimicrobial susceptibility profile of MRSA isolates was determined by the agar disk diffusion method. Molecular analysis of MRSA strains was accomplished by Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) and Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). Detection of mecA gene was used to confirm resistance to methicillin among the MRSA isolates. All the MRSA isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol, teicoplanin, tigecycline and vancomycin. All MRSAisolates were resistant to oxacillin, whilst 139 strains showed resistance against ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tetracycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. PFGE analysis of all the 140 MRSA isolates produced five distinct pulsotypes designated as pulsotypes A-E. Most of the isolates (n=132) were clustered into pulsotype A. The most prevalent sequence type (ST) was ST 239 (pulsotype A) found in 82% (37/45) of the tested isolates. The second most prevalent type was ST 1238 (pulsotypes B, C and D) found in 15% (7/45) of the isolates. The remaining type, ST 8 (pulsotype E) was found in a single isolate. The results of this study indicated that the MRSA clone ST 239 was a major clone in the selected university hospital of Tehran and that it was widely spread among the different wards as well as all the age groups of patients.",

Two hundred and thirty-two non-duplicate Staphylococcus spp. isolated from different clinical specimens were tested for mupirocin susceptibility using disk diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Resistance genes and clone relatedness was studied using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus primers (Eric-PCR) for the latter. Plasmid curing was performed to determine the genetic location of MupA gene. Among the 232 strains, 144 (62%) were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 33 (14.2%) methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and 55 (23.7%) were of other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (CoNS). Of all strains tested, only 6 (2.6%) were mupirocin resistant. MecA gene was detected in both MupL and MupH strains but MupA gene was only detected in MupH. Plasmid curing improved the plasmidic location of MupA gene. Molecular typing by Eric-PCR method revealed heterogenicity of the genetic make up of our MupL and MupH strains. Staphylococci with MupA-carrying genes are present in Jordanian hospitals, but thank to the limited use of mupirocin, they remain rare.",

The specimens were cultured for isolation of S. aureus by standard methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. For evaluation of the frequency of erythromycin induced clindamycin resistance, disk approximation test (D-test) was applied.Totally, 148 (29.6%) children were colonized by S. aureus. Out of 260 male, 94 (36.2%) and of 240 female, 54 (22.5%) cases were nasal carriers of S. aureus (P value = 0.001). Six (4.1%) of the 148 S. aureus isolated from children were MRSA strains. None of MRSA and methicillin susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) was resistant to vancomycin and clindamycin. Three of the 6 strains of MRSA and 7 (4.9%) of the 142 MSSA strains were resistant to erythromycin, and D-test was positive in all of them.We conclude that the rate of colonization by S. aureus is high in children attending day-care centers but colonization with MRSA is not common in our areas. Clindamycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazol could be used in mild to moderataly severe diseases caused by CA-MRSA. However, if the CA-MRSA isolates are erythromycin resistant, D-test should be carried out for detection of inducible clindamycin resistance.",

Vancomycin has been the most reliable therapeutic agent against infections caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The main objective of this study was to examine the occurrence of S. aureus species in dental caries specimens. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of S. aureus to four antibiotics namely vancomycin, linezolid, teicoplanin, and daptomycin was performed. Detection of vancomycin resistance was conducted using polymerase chain reaction. Among the tested 150 strains, 98 were MRSA and of that 54 were vancomycin sensitive and 27 were resistant. All 98 MRSA strains were positive for mecA and 36 yielded pvl, whereas 13 carried vanA and only 2 were positive for vanB. Majority of the isolates showed sensitivity toward daptomycin and linezolid. Strains of S. aureus exhibiting decreased susceptibility to different antibiotics like vancomycin, daptomycin, and linezolid severely compromise the therapeutic alternatives and require a considerable amount of time, public awareness, and integrative health-care strategies to prevent the emergence of resistance to these compounds.",

    "abstract": "Petroleum hydrocarbons and derivatives are widespread contaminants in both aquifers and soil, their elimination is in the primary focus of environmental studies. Microorganisms are key components in biological removal of pollutants. Strains capable to utilize hydrocarbons usually appear at the contaminated sites, but their metabolic activities are often restricted by the lack of nutrients and/or they can only utilize one or two components of a mixture. We isolated a novel Rhodococcus sp. MK1 strain capable to degrade the components of diesel oil simultaneously. The draft genome of the strain was determined and besides the chromosome, the presence of one plasmid could be revealed. Numerous routes for oxidation of aliphatic and aromatic compounds were identified. The strain was tested in ex situ applications aiming to compare alternative solutions for microbial degradation of hydrocarbons. The results of bioaugmentation and biostimulation experiments clearly demonstrated that - in certain cases - the indigenous microbial community could be exploited for bioremediation of oil-contaminated soils. Biostimulation seems to be efficient for removal of aged contaminations at lower concentration range, whereas bioaugmentation is necessary for the treatment of freshly and highly polluted sites.",

    "abstract": "The role of immune system is to protect the organism from the not built-in program-like alterations inside and against the agents penetrating from outside (bacteria, viruses, and protozoa). These functions were developed and formed during the evolution. Considering these functions, the immune system promotes the lengthening of lifespan and helps longevity. However, some immune functions have been conveyed by men to medical tools (e.g., pharmaceuticals, antibiotics, and prevention), especially in our modern age, which help the struggle against microbes, but evolutionarily weaken the immune system. Aging is a gradual slow attrition by autoimmunity, directed by the thymus and regulated by the central nervous system and pineal gland. Considering this, thymus could be a pacemaker of aging. The remodeling of the immune system, which can be observed in elderly people and centenarians, is probably not a cause of aging, but a consequence of it, which helps to suit immunity to the requirements. Oxidative stress also helps the attrition of the immune cells and antioxidants help to prolong lifespan. There are gender differences in the aging of the immune system as well as in the longevity. There is an advantage for women in both cases. This can be explained by hormonal differences (estrogens positively influences both processes); however, social factors are also not excluded. The endocrine disruptor chemicals act similar to estrogens, like stimulating or suppressing immunity and provoking autoimmunity; however, their role in longevity is controversial. There are some drugs (rapamycin, metformin, and selegiline) and antioxidants (as vitamins C and E) that prolong lifespan and also improve immunity. It is difficult to declare that longevity is exclusively dependent on the state of the immune system; however, there is a parallelism between the state of immune system and lifespan. It seems likely that there is not a real decline of immunity during aging, but there is a remodeling of the system according to the claims of senescence. This is manifested in the remaining (sometimes stronger) function of memory cells in contrast to the production and number of the new antigen-reactive naive T-cells.",

The biofilm bacterial community proved to be somewhat more diverse than that of the water sample and the distribution of the dominant bacterial clones was different between biofilm and water samples. The majority of biofilm clones was affiliated with Deltaproteobacteria and Nitrospirae while the largest group of water clones was related to Betaproteobacteria.

Eighty non-repetitive clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae were obtained from different clinical specimens. Antibiotic resistance pattern of isolates was determined by disk diffusion method and production of carbapenemases and MBLs was confirmed using modified Hodge test and E-test, respectively. Molecular detection of the antibiotic resistance genes was performed using PCR. Fifty-one (63.8%) isolates have decreased susceptibility to carbapenems, of which 46 (90.2%) isolates were as carbapenemase producer and four (7.8%) isolates were positive for MBLs, phenotypically. The results of PCR showed that the prevalence of blaOXA-48, blaNDM, blaSHV, blaCTX-M, and blaTEM genes among CRKP isolates were 90.2%, 15.7%, 98%, 96.1%, and 90.2%, respectively.

The aim of this study was to determine colistin resistance and heteroresistance rates in A. baumannii from clinical samples in Hacettepe University clinical microbiology laboratory between June 2016 and January 2017. A total of 200 isolates were included in the study. In vitro susceptibility to amikacin, gentamicin, ceftazidime, piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, and tigecycline were determined by disk diffusion test. Most isolates were multiresistant as they exhibited resistance to aminoglycosides, β-lactams, and fluoroquinolones. Colistin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution (BMD) test (EUCAST standards) and was compared with E-test (bioMérieux, France) in 120 isolates. In 14 blood isolates that were susceptible to colistin (MIC ≤ 2 mg/L), heteroresistance was investigated with the population analysis profile (PAP) method. Overall resistance (n = 200) to colistin was 28% by BMD. Among the 120 isolates where the two tests were compared, resistance to colistin was 25.8% versus 4.2% with BMD and E-test, respectively. Three blood isolates (21.4%) were heteroresistant to colistin. With E-test, a majority of the resistant isolates are overlooked and in vitro susceptibility to colistin should be determined with broth dilution method. This is the first study in Turkey reporting heteroresistance in A. baumannii isolates by the PAP method and emphasizes the need to test for heteroresistance in relation to clinical outcome in serious infections due to A. baumannii.",

In the present study, the immuno-modulatory and gut microbiota-reshaping effects of ginsenoside Rg1 were evaluated. Ginsenoside Rg1 acts as an immune-enhancing agent to increase spleen index and the number of T, B and dendritic cells in dexamethasone (Dex)-treated mice. Ginsenoside Rg1 also increased the production of sIgA and regulated the expression of interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-γ. Meanwhile, Rg1 administration regulated the structure of intestinal microbiota. The relative abundance of mouse intestinal microbial groups, such as Alistipes, Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Roseburia were increased by Rg1 administration, whereas a decrease in the potential pathogens like Helicobacteraceae, Dubosiella, Mycoplasma, Alloprevotella, Allobaculum was observed. Moreover, Rg1 metabolites of Lachnospiraceae bacterium enhanced the proliferation of CD4+ T cells and T regulatory (Treg) cells. Ginsenoside Rg1 improved the inflammatory condition of the colonic tissue and repaired the destructed mucosal barrier.

It is one of the primary causes of heart disease and stroke. Periodontal diseases encompass conditions like gingivitis and periodontitis, which are multifactorial diseases associated with dysbiotic plaque biofilms that trigger an immune-inflammatory host response, eventually resulting in the destruction of periodontal tissues. Links between periodontal disease and atherosclerosis may be based on direct invasion of periodontal pathogens or inflammatory mechanisms triggered by bacteria related to periodontal lesions, locally or systemically, that may impact the initiation of the atherosclerotic lesion. The presence of periodontal pathogens within an atheromatous lesion implies hematogenous dissemination. The invasion of atheroma by periodontal pathogens results in changes in the proatherogenic and proinflammatory properties of endothelial cells, leading to endothelial dysfunction, which is a hallmark of atherosclerosis. Clinical and epidemiological studies have offered sufficient evidence of periodontitis having an adverse effect on systemic health, including atherosclerosis; however, a direct causal effect has not yet been proved. This review aims to analyse scientific results regarding the mechanism by which periodontal pathogens may cause atherosclerosis as well as to describe the role of Porphyromonas gingivalis in atherosclerotic plaque development and progression.",

Methods We report the prevalence, genetic diversity, and antimicrobial resistance pattern of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from dogs and cats with eye discharges. Results A total of 12 (6.0%) coagulase-positives staphylococci were identified as (6/200, 3%) S. aureus and (6/200, 3%) S. pseudintermedius . The phenotypic methicillin resistance of S. aureus and S. pseudintermedius were 50.0% (3/6) and 16.7% (1/6), respectively. None of the isolates showed biofilm formation in the microtiter plate assay. The highest resistance (50.0%) for S. pseudintermedius strains was detected against clindamycin and tetracycline. 67.0% of S. aureus isolates were resistant to penicillin-G. The PCR analysis conducted for detection of mecA gene indicated that only one S. aureus isolated from a cat was mecA gene positive. Phylogenetic analysis based on repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) showed that all strains were typable and generated PCR products ranging from 800 bp to 4,400 bp. The lineages ST241 and the novel ST2361 in multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analysis were detected in one methicillin-susceptible S. pseudintermedius and methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius of dogs, respectively. In addition, the lineages ST4155 and ST7217 of two methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains of cats were connected epidemiologically to previously reported cases. Conclusions These results indicate epidemiologically related strains (ST241, ST4155, and ST7217) transferring between animals and humans. Therefore, the strategies to combat the widespread MRS should be based on collaboration between human and veterinary medicine under the One Health concept.",

    "abstract": "Fungi, in particular Aspergilli, are well known for their potential to overproduce a variety of organic acids. These microorganisms have an intrinsic ability to accumulate these substances and it is generally believed that this provides the fungi with an ecological advantage, since they grow rather well at pH 3 to 5, while some species even tolerate pH values as low as 1. 5. Organic acid production can be stimulated and in a number of cases conditions have been found that result in almost quantitative conversion of carbon substrate into acid. This is exploited in large-scale production of a number of organic acids like citric-, gluconic- and itaconic acid. Both in production volume as well as in knowledge available, citrate is by far the major organic acid. Citric acid (2-hydroxy-propane-1, 2, 3-tricarboxylic acid) is a true bulk product with an estimated global production of over 900 thousand tons in the year 2000. Till the beginning of the 20th century, it was exclusively extracted from lemons. Since the global market was dominated by an Italian cartel, other means of production were sought. Chemical synthesis was possible, but not suitable due to expensive raw materials and a complicated process with low yield. The discovery of citrate accumulation by Aspergillus niger led to a rapid development of a fermentation process, which only a decade later accounted for a large part of the global production. The application of citric acid is based on three of its properties: (1) acidity and buffer capacity, (2) taste and flavour, and (3) chelation of metal ions. Because of its three acid groups with pKa values of 3. 1, 4. 7 and 6. 4, citrate is able to produce a very low pH in solution, but is also useful as a buffer over a broad range of pH values (2 to 7). Citric acid has a pleasant acid taste which leaves little aftertaste. It sometimes enhances flavour, but is also able to mask sweetness, such as the aspartame taste in diet beverages. Chelation of metal ions is a very important property that has led to applications such as antioxidant and preservative. Moreover, it is a \"natural\" substance and fully biodegradable.",

Only one P. aeruginosa isolate with strain number 722 proved MBL-positive that harboured a novel class 1 integron with a blaVIM-2 -like cassette in the first position, followed by orfD , a putative gene with unknown function. Our data indicate that MBL-producing strains occur at a prevalence of less than 1% among imipenemnonsusceptible P. aeruginosa clinical isolates in this Belgrade hospital. The newly identified VIM MBL-producing P. aeruginosa strain 722 could be assigned to serotype O11, and it was panresistant to all antimicrobials tested. The isolate displayed sequence type ST235 by multilocus sequence typing which is the founder sequence type of the previously identified international clonal complex CC11 that already contains blaVIM -positive isolates from Italy, Greece, Sweden, Hungary and Poland. In conclusion, this is the first report of VIM MBL-producing P. aeruginosa from Serbia and also of the occurrence of such isolates belonging to the international clonal complex CC11 in this country.",

However, despite the quantitative variations, each strain had a similar pattern of enzyme accumulation in fermentation of both substrates. Laccase and MnP activities were high during substrate colonization and declined rapidly during fruiting body development. On the contrary, in substrate colonization P. ostreatus expressed comparatively low activity of hydrolases. When primordia appeared, the activity of these enzymes sharply increased. Both cellulase and xylanase activity peaked at the mature fruiting body stage. When mushrooms shifted to the vegetative growth, the activity of ligninolytic enzymes again gradually increased, whereas the activity of hydrolases decreased.",

Immature host defense mechanisms support early-onset sepsis, which can be very serious with very high mortality. While the past decade has been marked by a significant decline in early-onset group B streptococcal (GBS) sepsis in both term and preterm neonates, the overall incidence of early-onset sepsis has not decreased in many centers, and several studies have found an increase in sepsis due to gram-negative organisms. With increasing survival of these more fastidious preterm infants, late-onset sepsis or specially nosocomial bloodstream infection (BSI) will continue to be a challenging complication that affects other morbidities, length of hospitalization, cost of care, and mortality rates. Especially the very low birthweight (VLBW) infants sensitive to serious systemic infection during their initial hospital stay. Sepsis caused by multiresistant organisms and Candida spp. are also increasing in incidence, has become the most common cause of death among preterm infants.

Two and five days later bacterial samples were collected and streaked onto Columbia agar. CFU/mL were counted. The canal walls were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The gas phase was investigated in an upside down Petri dish where E. faecalis was inoculated onto blood agar. The irrigants were placed on absorbent paper into the cover. Bacteria were detectable in the control group, but not in any of the irrigants groups. There was a massive reinfection 2 or 5 days after irrigation in the control group. The lowest reinfection was found after the ClO2 treatment. These findings were confirmed by SEM images. We observed an antibacterial effect of ClO2 and NaOCl gas phases on E. faecalis growth, but not of CHX. ClO2 eliminates intracanal biofilm and keeps canal nearly free from bacteria. We suggest the use of high purity ClO2 as a root canal irrigant in clinical practice.",

Composition of the new media tends to reproduce the nutrient deficient conditions of the investigated water, therefore media were highly oligotrophic. Altogether 122 bacterial strains were isolated from the 5 different media. Based on ARDRA grouping 27 strains were chosen for the partial 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The results showed that the applied media strongly influence the composition of the cultivable bacterial community. A larger scale of α-Proteobacteria (Mesorhizobium spp., Ancylobacter sp., Methylobacterium sp.) and many Actinobacteria (Leifsonia sp., Microbacterium spp., Mycobacterium spp.) could be isolated from the same ultrapure water system than with any other cultivation methods or media applied before.

To elucidate the functional state of T cells in guttate psoriasis, we analysed mRNA expression levels of T-bet and GATA-3 for Th1 and Th2 differentiation, respectively together with Th1 (IFN-γ) and Th2 (IL-4) cytokine mRNA expression. Relative quantification of T-bet, GATA-3, IFN-γ and Th2, and IL-4 transcripts in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) was conducted by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Serum levels of IFN-γ and Th2 and IL-4 were also determined by ELISA. GATA-3 and IL-4 mRNA expression levels were lower in psoriatic patients as compared to normal healthy controls. The expression levels of T-bet and IFN-γ and Th2 genes were relatively similar in the patients and controls. In addition, a marked decrease in plasma IL-4 levels was observed in the psoriasis group, while no differences were observed with regard to levels of IFN-γ and Th2 between patients and normal subjects. Furthermore, a clear correlation between decreased IL-4 mRNA expression and IL-4 (P < 0.05) was revealed. These results suggested that altered balance between Th1 and Th2 cells transcription factor genes and they products may be implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.",

    "abstract": "Growth and metabolic activity of several new, human origin isolates of Bifidobacterium strains were investigated. All tested bifidobacteria strains were grown well on the native soymilk medium without any additional nutrients. The fermentation processes cultured with initial cell concentrations in 10⁵ -10⁷ cfu/ml resulted in 10⁸ cfu/ml after 8-12 h of incubation in soymilk, and were kept viable up to the end of fermentation (48 h). Volumetric productivities of B. bifidum B3.2, B. bifidum B7.1 and B. breve B9.14 were 1.6 × 10¹⁰ cfu/L.h, 4.5 × 10¹⁰ cfu/L.h and 7.6 × 10⁹ cfu/L.h, respectively, whereas these values of B. lactis Bb-12 and B. longum Bb-46 probiotic strains were 2.7 × 10⁹ cfu/L.h and 1.0 x 10¹⁰ cfu/L.h. The α-galactosidase activities were also detected in the intracellular fraction of the disrupted cells. Productions of lactic and acetic acids were in the range of 23-60 mmol/L and 2.4-5.6 mmol/L, respectively. Molar ratios of acetate to lactate in all tested strains varied from 0.05-0.1 that are very promising for further technological development of probiotic fermented soy-based food products.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to objectively assess the hand hygiene performance of medical students. Hand rubbing technique was evaluated by employing innovative UV-light-based imaging technology, identifying patterns and trends in missed areas after applying WHO’s six-step protocol. This specially designed hand hygiene education and assessment program targeted 1,344 medical students at two distant sites in Central Europe. Students were introduced to a short video, presenting the basics of hand hygiene, and then received further demonstration from professional trainers, focusing on the correct execution of WHO’s six-step technique. To verify the acquired skill, participants rubbed their hands with UV-marked alcohol-based solution. Digital images of the hands were recorded under UV light, followed by computer evaluation and assessment. Immediate objective visual feedback was given to the participants showing missed areas on their hands. The statistical analysis of missed spots was based on retrospective expert-driven manual evaluation. Significant difference in rubbing quality was found between female and male participants [35.3% (CI 95%: 33–38%) versus 29.0% (CI 95%: 27–31%), p &lt; 0.001], dominant and non-dominant hands [43.4% (CI 95%: 39–48%) versus 34.9% (CI 95%: 32–38%), p = 0.002], and various zones of the hands’ dorsal side. Based on the participants’ feedback and the evaluation of the infection control specialists, it can be stated that the identification of typically missed patterns and the instant visual feedback have a vital role in improving the hand hygiene technique of prospective medical staff.",

Survival of many waterborne pathogens within free-living amoeba (FLA) is well documented; however, the role of amoebae in the environmental persistence of F. tularensis is unclear. In this study, axenic FLA cultures of Acanthamoeba castellanii , Acanthamoeba polyphaga , and Vermamoeba vermiformis were each inoculated with virulent strains of F. tularensis (Types A and B), the attenuated live vaccine strain, and Francisella novicida . Experimental parameters included low and high multiplicity of infection and incubation temperatures of 25 and 30 ° C for 0–10 days. Francisella spp. survival was enhanced by the presence of FLA; however, bacterial growth and protozoa infectivity were not observed. In contrast, co-infections of A. polyphaga and Legionella pneumophila , used as an amoeba pathogen control, resulted in bacterial proliferation, cytopathic effects, and amoebal lysis. Collectively, even though short-term incubation with FLA was beneficial, the long-term effects on Francisella survival are unknown, especially given the expenditure of available amoebal derived nutrients and the fastidious nature of Francisella spp. These factors have clear implications for the role of FLA in Francisella environmental persistence.",

Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse colitis model has been used in understanding the mechanism of IBD. This study was conducted to examine selected Lactobacillus spp. as potential IBD treatment in the DSS-induced animal model. Balb/c mice were used and colitis was induced by adding 5% dextran sodium sulfate into the drinking water for 8 days. Colon length, disease activity index (DAI) and histological analysis were measured as markers of inflammation in DSS colitis mice. The majority of the Lactobacillus species significantly prevented the shortening of the colon length compared with the DSS group. The DAI scores of mice were significantly reduced following usage of four Lactobacillus strains included: Lactobacillus plantarum 03 and 06, Lactobacillus brevis 02 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus 01. The histological analysis exhibited that oral administration of Lactobacillus strains had therapeutic effects on mice colitis. L. plantarum and L. brevis showed better therapeutic effect against DSS-induced acute colitis mice. The probiotic activities of these three isolates indicated that the probiotic effects were strain specific and none of these useful bacteria could exhibit all of the valued probiotic properties simultaneously.",

The gluteraldahyde or formaldehyde (at 1% and 2% concentration, v/v) activated matrix was exposed to the Tris buffered lipase. The enzyme was adsorbed/entrapped more rapidly on to the activated silica than on the activated celite. The immobilized lipase showed optimal activity at 50 degrees C following one-hour incubation. The lipase was specifically more hydrolytic to the medium C-length ester (p-nitro phenyl caprylate than p-nitro phenyl laurate). The immobilization/entrapment enhanced the stability of the lipase at a relatively higher temperature (50 degrees C) and also promoted enzyme activity at an acidic pH (pH 5.5). Moreover, the immobilized lipase was quite resistant to the denaturing effect of SDS.",

    "abstract": "Anaerobic infections are common and can cause diseases associated with severe morbidity, but are easily overlooked in clinical settings. Both the relatively small number of infections due to exogenous anaerobes and the much larger number of infections involving anaerobic species that are originally members of the normal flora, may lead to a life-threatening situation unless appropriate treatment is instituted. Special laboratory procedures are needed for the isolation, identification and susceptibility testing of this diverse group of bacteria. Since many anaerobes grow more slowly than the facultative or aerobic bacteria, and particularly since clinical specimens yielding anaerobic bacteria commonly contain several organisms and often very complex mixtures of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, considerable time may elapse before the laboratory is able to provide a final report. Species definition based on phenotypic features is often time-consuming and is not always easy to carry out. Molecular genetic methods may help in the everyday clinical microbiological practice in laboratories dealing with the diagnostics of anaerobic infections. Methods have been introduced for species diagnostics, such as 16S rRNA PCR-RFLP profile determination, which can help to distinguish species of Bacteroides, Prevotella, Actinomyces, etc. that are otherwise difficult to differentiate. The use of DNA-DNA hybridization and the sequencing of special regions of the 16S rRNA have revealed fundamental taxonomic changes among anaerobic bacteria. Some anaerobic bacteria are extremely slow growing or not cultivatable at all. To detect them in special infections involving flora changes due to oral malignancy or periodontitis, for instance, a PCR-based hybridization technique is used. Molecular methods have demonstrated the spread of specific resistance genes among the most important anaerobic bacteria, the members of the Bacteroides genus. Their detection and investigation of the IS elements involved in their expression may facilitate following of the spread of antibiotic resistance among anaerobic bacteria involved in infections and in the normal flora members. Molecular methods (a search for toxin genes and ribotyping) may promote a better understanding of the pathogenic features of some anaerobic infections, such as the nosocomial diarrhoea caused by C. difficile and its spread in the hospital environment and the community. The investigation of toxin production at a molecular level helps in the detection of new toxin types. This mini-review surveys some of the results obtained by our group and others using molecular genetic methods in anaerobic diagnostics.",

However, malathion has the potential to produce toxic effects in mammalian systems. In this study, Pseudomonas aeruginosa AA 112 which was isolated from soil using enrichment technique could utilize the malathion as a sole carbon source and a source of energy. Pseudomonas aeruginosa AA112 was able to grow in MSMPY medium containing 42.75 mg/ml malathion. However, the optimum concentration of malathion which supported the maximum bacterial growth was found to be 22. 8 mg/ml. Malathion was used as an initial source of energy and carbon when it was found without additional carbon sources (in MSM medium) while it was utilized as second source of energy and carbon in a nutrient-supplemented medium (in MSMPY medium). Moreover, lead acetate test indicated that malathion was first attacked at a sulphur site 1-2 hours after the start of incubation. TLC and IR analysis indicated that malathion was completely degraded into diethyl succinate, hydrogen sulphide and phosphates. Therefore a malathion degradation pathway was proporsed. The degradation of malathion is attributed to the genes located on the chromosome and at least three proteins of high molecular size might be involved in malathion utilization. Bacteria able to use malathion as a food source or metabolize its residues in the environment to inactive, less toxic, and harmless compounds, could be used in bioremediation of an environmental pollution caused by the pesticide.",

B. cereus lipase was deposited on celite (77% protein binding efficiency) by direct binding from aqueous solution. Immobilized lipase was used to synthesis of ethyl acetate from vinyl acetate and ethanol in n -nonane.

A significant subgroup of MDS may develop from subclinical HLH. In that case, HLH-like disease would chronically proceed with little disease activity or under occasional flares only, until it first becomes clinically apparent at the MDS stage. At the MDS stage, however, HLH activity may be easily overlooked by histological or cytogenetic means, since hemophagocytosis has fallen already largely silent. Current treatment options for HLH, like high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), may turn out to be helpful in MDS patients as well. In rare and extreme cases, Leptospira infection causes severe and life-threatening HLH. Thus, this proposal also implies that an insufficient, dysfunctional or misdirected immunological response to Leptospira infection may lead to MDS in the long run in a significant number of cases, which have not been recognized as Leptospira -triggered events in the first place. Infections by agents other than Leptospira may lead to subclinical HLH-like disease with MDS as a late stage as well.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the antibacterial properties of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX), Listerine®, and high purity chlorine dioxide (Solumium, ClO2) on selected common oral pathogen microorganisms and on dental biofilm in vitro. Antimicrobial activity of oral antiseptics was compared to the gold standard phenol. We investigated Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Veillonella alcalescens, Eikenella corrodens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Candida albicans as some important representatives of the oral pathogens. Furthermore, we collected dental plaque from the upper first molars of healthy young students. Massive biofilm was formed in vitro and its reduction was measured after treating it with mouthrinses: CHX, Listerine® or hyper pure ClO2. Their biofilm disrupting effect was measured after dissolving the crystal violet stain from biofilm by photometer. The results have showed that hyper pure ClO2 solution is more effective than other currently used disinfectants in case of aerobic bacteria and Candida yeast. In case of anaerobes its efficiency is similar to CHX solution. The biofilm dissolving effect of hyper pure ClO2 is significantly stronger compared to CHX and Listerine® after 5 min treatment. In conclusion, hyper pure ClO2 has a potent disinfectant efficacy on oral pathogenic microorganisms and a powerful biofilm dissolving effect compared to the current antiseptics, therefore high purity ClO2 may be a new promising preventive and therapeutic adjuvant in home oral care and in dental or oral surgery practice.",

Altogether, four methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains were detected by mecA polymerase chain reaction, which means 0.8% community-acquired MRSA prevalence among the S. aureus isolates. All MRSA strains harbored the SCCmec type IV cassette (typical for CA-MRSA) and belonged to ST45 by multilocus sequence typing. During antibiotic susceptibility testing, we measured the following resistance rates: 0.0% for mupirocin, 0.2% for ciprofloxacin, 0.6% for gentamicin and oxacillin, 3.4% for tetracycline, 9.5% for clindamycin, 10.3% for erythromycin, and 91.4% for penicillin, which are generally lower compared with Hungarian clinical isolates.",

By this effect, it is an important factor of (human) evolution protecting man from harmful impacts, similarly to the role of immunity. However, immunity is also continuously influenced by hormetic effects of environmental [chemical (pollutions), physical (background irradiations and heat), etc.] and medical (drugs and therapeutic irradiations) and food interactions. In contrast to earlier beliefs, the no-threshold irradiation dogma is not valid in low-dose domains and here the hormesis concept is valid. Low-dose therapeutic irradiation, as well as background irradiations (by radon spas or moderately far from the epicenter of atomic bomb or nuclear facilities), is rather beneficial than destructive and the fear from them seems to be unreasonable from immunological point of view. Practically, all immune parameters are beneficially influenced by all forms of low-dose radiations.",

However, it contains, synthesizes, stores and secretes lots of substances, which initiates other reactions or participates in them. These are in connection with the deterioration of tissue correlation, as malignant tumors, angiogenesis, wound healing, pregnancy and different pathological conditions. In addition — as other members of the immune system — mast cells can synthesize, store and secrete hormones characteristic to the endocrine glands and can transport them to the site of requirement (packed transport), or produce and employ them locally. The effect of mast cells is controversial and frequently dual, stimulatory or inhibitory to the same organ or process. This is likely due to the heterogeneity of the mast cells, in morphology and cell content alike and dependent on the actual condition of the targeted tissue. The cells are transported in an unmatured form by the blood circulation and are exposed to microenvironmental effects, which influence their maturation. Their enrichment around tumors suggested using them as targets for tumor therapy more than fifty years ago (by the author), however, this idea lives its renaissance now.

Molecular typing, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, detection of common β-lactamase genes ( bla CTX-M , bla TEM and bla SHV ) and virulence associated traits (hypermucoviscosity, magA , k2a , rmpA , siderophores, type 1 and 3 fimbria, biofilm formation, serum resistance) were performed for 102 isolates. The results showed the presence of three major ciprofloxacin resistant CTX-M-15 producing clones (ST15 n = 69, ST101 n = 10, and ST147 n = 9), of which ST15 was predominant and universally widespread. Considering distribution in time and place, ST101 and ST147 were detected at fewer inpatient units and within a narrower time frame, as compared to ST15. Beside major clones, eleven minor clones were identified, and were shown to harbour the following β-lactamase genes: six clones carried bla CTX-M , four clones harboured bla SHV-5 and one clone possessed both bla CTX-M and ESBL type bla SHV . Among the SHV-5 producing K. pneumoniae clones a novel sequence type was found, namely ST1193, which harboured a unique infB allele. Different virulence factor content and peculiar antimicrobial susceptibility profile were characteristic for each clone. In contrast to major clone isolates, which showed high level resistance to ciprofloxacin, minor clone isolates displayed significantly lower MIC values for ciprofloxacin suggesting a role for fluoroquinolones in the dissemination of the major K. pneumoniae clones. This is the first description of the CTX-M-15 producing K. pneumoniae clone ST101 in Hungary.",

There is limited information on the microbiology of thermal baths in their complexity, tracking community shifts from the thermal wells to the pools. In the present study, the natural microbial community of well and pool waters in Gellért bath was studied in detail by cultivation-based techniques. To isolate bacteria, 10% R2A and minimal synthetic media (with \"bath water\") with agar-agar and gellan gum were used after prolonged incubation time; moreover, polyurethane blocks covered with media were also applied. Strains were identified by sequencing their 16S rRNA gene after grouping them by amplified rDNA restriction analysis. From each sample, the dominance of Alphaproteobacteria was characteristic though their diversity differed among samples. Members of Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Beta- and Gamma-proteobacteria, Deinococcus-Thermus, and Bacteroidetes were also identified. Representatives of Deinococcus-Thermus phylum appeared only in the pool water. The largest groups in the pool water belonged to the Tistrella and Chelatococcus genera. The most dominant member in the well water was a new taxon, its similarity to Hartmannibacter diazotrophicus as closest relative was 93.93%.",

    "abstract": "Klebsiella spp. are among the most frequently isolated bacteria from burn wounds. These organisms are among the most important opportunistic pathogens, causing hospital-acquired and healthcare-associated infections worldwide. Limited information is available about prevalence of AmpC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae from burn patients. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the characterization of AmpC beta-lactamase among K. pneumoniae isolated from burn patients. Samples were collected from wound specimens of patients with burn injury from a burn hospital in Tehran during 18 months (March 2015 to August 2016). For phenotypic detection of AmpC beta-lactamase, disk diffusion method with cefoxitin was used for screening, AmpC disk test and boronic acid inhibitor-based method were used as confirmatory tests. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to screen all isolates with AmpC genes including ACCM, DHAM, EBCM, FOXM, MOXM, and CITM. Finally, PCR products were validated using sequencing. During this study, 102 isolates of K. pneumoniae were collected. Among these isolates, 52.9% suspected as AmpC producer by disk agar diffusion cefoxitin screening method. By confirmatory phenotypic methods, 19.6% of isolates considered as AmpC producer. Molecular analysis revealed 43.1% of cefoxitin-resistant isolates harbored at least one of the AmpC genes including CITM (22.5%), EBCM (21.5%), DHAM (7.8%), and FOXM (0.98%). In addition, 5.8% of isolates harbored two AmpC genes and 2.9% harbored three AmpC genes. In conclusion, K. pneumoniae is becoming a serious problem in burn patients. Accurate and precise methods and guidelines should be designed for detection of antibiotic-resistant mechanisms. Our data showed the high rate of AmpC beta-lactamase among K. pneumoniae isolated from burn patients, which limit the treatment options. Therefore, the results of this study can provide evidence to help for appropriate treatment of burn patients.",

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing for ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and imipenem was performed by broth microdilution method. All strains were screened for PMQR genes by PCR. Virulence determinants, namely afa, pap, pil, sfa/foc, and kpsMT of eight Escherichia coli strains proven positive for at least one qnr gene, were investigated by PCR. All of the eight investigated strains carried the pil gene, showing that P fimbria is a common virulence determinant among qnr positive E. coli. Out of 214 tested strains, 38 yielded any PMQR determinant, altogether 45 genes were detected namely, 6 qnrA, 1 qnrB, 2 qnrD and 8 qnrS, 9 aac(6')-Ib-cr, and 19 oqxAB; however, neither qepA nor qnrC were detected.

In this study, we demonstrated 17.7% prevalence of PMQR-positive Enterobacteriaceae and first reported qnrD-resistance determinant in Hungary. Altogether, 25 PMQR-positive strains were susceptible or low-level resistant to ciprofloxacin with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) between 0.06 and 1 mg/L, suggesting that prevalence of PMQR determinants is underestimated and screening among clinical isolates exhibiting reduced susceptibility is necessary.

This study was conducted on 80 isolates of E. faecalis isolated from outpatients with urinary tract infection during a period of 1 year from April 2014 to April 2015. The antibiotic susceptibility patterns of isolates were determined by the disk diffusion method and presence of efrA and efrB genes was detected by PCR and sequencing. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to ciprofloxacin (CIP) were measured with and without carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) by broth microdilution. The highest resistance rate was observed to erythromycin (83.3%) and the prevalence of efrA and efrB genes in all E. faecalis isolates was 100%. This study showed that 9 out of 13 (69.2%) ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates became less resistant at least fourfolds to CIP in the presence of efflux pump inhibitor. Our result showed that CCCP as an efflux inhibitor can increase effect of CIP as an efficient antibiotic and it is suggested that efrAB efflux pumps are involved in resistance to fluoroquinolone.",

Pathogenicity of this microorganism is mainly linked to its capability to form biofilm structures. Biofilm formation vastly depends on several factors including different proteins. We studied the expression levels of three proteins including SdrH, Bap, AtlE, and MazF at different time intervals during the course of biofilm formation. In this study, a catheter-derived S. epidermidis isolate with strong ability of biofilm formation was selected. PCR assay was used to detect sdrH , bap , atlE , and mazF genes in this isolate. Real-time PCR was used to determine the expression levels of these genes after 4, 8, and 20 h during the course of biofilm formation. The studied genes showed different expression levels at different time intervals during biofilm formation by real-time PCR method. Expression levels of atlE and sdrH genes were the highest at 4 h, whereas bap gene showed the highest expression level at 8 h during the course of biofilm formation. In addition, the expression level of mazF gene peaked at 4 h and then progressively decreased at 8 and 20 h. Our results suggest the importance of AtlE, SdrH, and MazF proteins in the establishment and development of the biofilm structure. In addition, our results showed the important role of protein Bap in the accumulation of biofilm structure. Future studies are required to understand the exact role of MazF in the process of biofilm formation.",

There has been an increase in resistance to SXT of S. maltophilia over recent years. In this study 30 S. maltophilia clinical isolates resistant to SXT were investigated. Antibiotic susceptibilities for ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, doxycycline, tigecycline, ceftazidime, colistin and chloramphenicol were determined by broth microdilution method. None of the strains were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, tigecycline, ceftazidime or colistin. Only 37% of the isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin or moxifloxacin. Two isolates resistant to all tested antibiotic agents and two others susceptible only to doxycycline were further investigated: susceptibility for combinations of antibiotics was analyzed by checkerboard technique. According to the fractional inhibitory concentration indices calculated, moxifloxacin plus ceftazidime combination was found to be synergistic in each case. Genetic testing revealed the predominance of sul1 gene. Our study concluded that the range of effective antibiotic agents is even more limited in infections caused by SXT-resistant S. maltophilia . In these cases, in vitro synergistic antibiotic combinations could be potential therapeutic options.",

A total of 103 isolates were tested for quinolone susceptibility by microdilution method and PMQR genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction. About 40 ESBL-producing E. coli (39%) and 50 ESBL-producing Klebsiella spp. strains (48%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin; 40 ESBL-producing E. coli (39%) and 47 ESBL-producing Klebsiella spp. strains (45%) were resistant to levofloxacin; and 88 strains including 40 ESBL-producing E. coli (39%) and 48 (47%) ESBL-producing Klebsiella spp. were resistant to moxifloxacin. Among the 103 ESBL-producing isolates, 77 (75%) isolates (30 E. coli and 47 Klebsiella spp.) harbored PMQR genes. The most commonly detected gene was aac(6′)-Ib-cr (65%).

The faecal samples from parvovirus suspected dogs were collected from various states of India for screening by PCR assay and 66.29% of samples were found positive. Six CPV-2a, three CPV-2b, and one CPV-2c types were identified by sequence analysis. Several unique and existing mutations have been noticed in CPV types analyzed indicating emergence of newer variants of CPV in India. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that all the field CPV types were grouped in different subclades within two main clades, but away from the commercial vaccine strains. CPV-2b and CPV-2c types with unique mutations were found to be establishing in India apart from the prevailing CPV-2a type. Mutations and the positive selection of the mutants were found to be the major mechanism of emergence and evolution of parvovirus. Therefore, the incorporation of local strain in the vaccine formulation may be considered for effective control of CPV infections in India.",

The aim of this study was to report the prevalence of quinolone resistance genes among E. coli and K. pneumoniae clinical strains isolated from three educational hospitals of Tehran, Iran. Materials and methods: A total of 100 strains of E. coli from Labbafinejad and Taleghani Hospitals and 100 strains of K. pneumoniae from Mofid Children and Taleghani Hospitals were collected between January 2013 and May 2014. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were done by disk diffusion method based on Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Detection of qepA , aac(6′)-Ib-cr , acrA , and acrB genes was done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: In this study, fosfomycin and imipenem against E. coli and fosfomycin and tigecycline against K. pneumoniae had the best effect in antimicrobial susceptibility tests. PCR assay using specific primers demonstrated that the prevalence of qepA , aac(6′)-Ib-cr , acrA , and acrB genes among the 100 E. coli isolates was 0 (0%), 87 (87%), 92 (92%), and 84 (84%), respectively.

Conclusion: The distribution of qepA , aac(6′)-Ib-cr , acrA , and acrB resistance determinants in E. coli and K. pneumoniae is a great concern. Therefore, infection control and prevention of spread of drug-resistant bacteria need careful management of medication and identification of resistant isolates.",

It is therefore important to collect and to analyze data related to the infection caused by different variants. We have obtained more than 3,700 COVID-19 patients between April 2020 and March 2021 from Tokat, Turkey (roughly 3,100 outpatients and close to 600 inpatients) where about 30% were infected with Alpha variant (B.1.1.7). Descriptive statistics was used to characterize different subgroups. Both logistic regression and cause-specific Cox survival analysis of competing-risk was run on inpatients, to examine the impact of Alpha variant on hospitalization, on mortality and on other factors. We observed that the Alpha variant is over-represented in inpatients than outpatients so infection by Alpha variant increases the chance for hospitalization. The impact of Alpha variant on mortality seems to depend on the patient's age. For patients under age of 70, the case-fatality-rate was 0.84% (5.3%) for patients without (with) Alpha variant (Fisher's test P -value = 2.4 × 10 −10 ). For patients above age of 70, the trend is opposite: the case-fatality-rate is 31.5% (13.6%) for patients without (with) Alpha variant (Fisher's test P -value = 0.0016). The two opposite trends would cancel each other, making other analyses such as cause-specific Cox regression and logistic regression non-significant. The Alpha variant increases the risk for hospitalization, increases the case-fatality-rate for lower age group, and decreases the case-fatality-rate for the upper age group. If the increase of case-fatality-rate in not the most senior group holds true, it should provide useful information for a vaccination planning to counter the impact of Alpha variants.",

Our aim was to analyze the resistance patterns of these bacteria over ten years in clinical samples of our department. We examined the sample types from which these pathogens were most frequently isolated. The incidence of tests with resistant results for each pathogen in aggregate and the most important subgroups of each was also analyzed. We have also intended to predict the local priorities amongst these pathogens. The results of 1,268,126 antibiotic susceptibility tests performed on a total of 70,099 isolates over this period were examined. Most strains were derived from urine, blood culture, trachea, vagina, wounds, and abscesses. Prevalence of ESKAPE bacteria increased between 2011 and 2020 however, the steepest intensifications were seen in the cases of K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa . The number of antibiotic susceptibility tests with resistant results has also increased over the decade but the most notable increase was detected in E. faecium and A. baumannii . Based on the calculation of antimicrobial resistance index for each pathogen, the most serious challenges for us at present are A. baumannii , P. aeruginosa , and E. faecium and their multi-resistant forms. The theoretical prediction of proportion of resistant tests between 2020 and 2030 in our care area draws attention to a worrying trend in the cases of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii strains.",

Anti-HAV total immunoglobulin was tested by using a microparticle EIA (Axsym-Abbott Lab). Anti-HEV IgG was assayed by a micro ELISA method (Genelabs-Singapore). Of the 338 sera tested, 112 (33.1%) were positive for anti-HAV total antibody. Anti-HEV IgG was detected in three (0.89%) of the serum samples. Seropositivity rates of HAV in preschool and school children were 19.9% and 43.9% respectively (p < 0.001). No antibody to HEV was detected in preschool children, while the prevalence of anti-HEV IgG was 1.6% in children attending school.

    "abstract": "Iron is an essential nutrient for most organisms because it serves as a catalytic cofactor in oxidation-reduction reactions. Iron is rather unavailable because it occurs in its insoluble ferric form in oxides and hydroxides, while in serum of mammalian hosts is highly bound to carrier proteins such as transferrin, so the free iron concentration is extremely low insufficient for microbial growth. Therefore, many organisms have developed different iron-scavenging systems for solubilizing ferric iron and transporting it into cells across the fungal membrane. There are three major mechanisms by which fungi can obtain iron from the host: (a) utilization of a high affinity iron permease to transport iron intracellularly, (b) production and secretion of low molecular weight iron-specific chelators (siderophores), (c) utilization of a hem oxygenase to acquire iron from hemin. Patients with elevated levels of available serum iron treated with iron chelator, deferoxamine to remedy iron overload conditions have an increased susceptibility of invasive zygomycosis. Presumably deferoxamine predisposes patients to Zygomycetes infections by acting as a siderophore]. The frequency of zygomycosis is increasing in recent years and these infections respond very poorly to currently available antifungal agents, so new approaches to develop strategies to prevent and treat zygomycosis are urgently needed. Siderophores and iron-transport proteins have been suggested to function as virulence factors because the acquisition of iron is a crucial pathogenetic event. Biosynthesis and uptake of siderophores represent possible targets for antifungal therapy.",

Several data were published in the last decade also about the clinical importance of this genus, indicating that Trichoderma strains may be potential opportunistic pathogens in immunocompromised patients. However, there is a lack of information about the potential virulence factors of clinical Trichoderma strains. This study was designed to examine the extracellular proteolytic enzymes of six clinical T. longibrachiatum isolates. Supernatants from induced liquid cultures of the examined strains were screened for proteolytic enzyme activities with 11 different chromogenic p-nitroaniline substrates. The production of trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like and chymoelastase-like protease activities cleaving N-Benzoyl-L-Phe-L-Val-L-Arg-p-nitroanilide, N-Succinyl-L-Ala-L-Ala-L-Pro-L-Phe-p-nitroanilide,and N-Succinyl-L- Ala-L-Ala-L-Pro-L-Leu-p-nitroanilide, respectively, was common among the strains examined. Separation of trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like activities by column chromatography revealed, that both systems are complex consisting of several isoenzymes. The pH-dependence of these two protease systems was also studied. Based on the results, the different isoenzymes seem to have different optimal pH values. Extracellular proteolytic enzymes may be involved in the pathogenecity of Trichoderma strains as facultative human pathogens.",

Pheromones and pheromone receptor genes have been identified, however, in members of all true fungal lineages, and even for mycelia forming organisms of plant and amoeba lineages, like oomycetes and myxomycetes. The mating systems and genes governing the mating type are different in fungi, ranging from bipolar with two opposite mating types to tetrapolar mating systems (with four possible mating outcomes, only one of which leads to fertile sexual development) in homobasidioymcetes with more than 23,000 mating types occurring in nature. Pheromones and receptors specifically recognizing these pheromones have evolved with slightly different functions in these different systems. This review is dedicated to follow the evolution of pheromone/receptor systems from simple, biallelic bipolar systems to multiallelic, tetrapolar versions and to explain the slightly different functions the pheromone recognition and subsequent signal transduction cascades within the fungal kingdom. The biotechnological implications of a detailed understanding of mating systems for biological control and plant protection, in medicine, and in mushroom breeding are discussed.",

Hence, purified polygalacturonase from Mucor circinelloides was used to study its effect on the improvement of tea leaves fermentation. The partially purified polygalacturonase from Mucor circinelloides was found to be most effective in tea fermentation, whereas pectin lyase from Byssochlamys fulva had little role in improvement of tea quality.",

    "abstract": "Human enterovirus 109 (EV109) is a recently identified recombinant enterovirus in family Picornaviridae from acute paediatric respiratory illness in Nicaragua. EV109 have not been reported elsewhere. Our aims were the molecular detection and genetic analysis of EV109 from acute childhood respiratory infections in Hungary. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from children under age of 10 years with acute respiratory infections treated in Department of Pulmonology, Kaposi Mór Teaching Hospital, Mosdós, Hungary. Samples were taken from 15 October to 15 May in two respiratory seasons 2005/2006 and 2006/2007. Samples were tested using EV109 specific VP1 primers by RT-PCR method. One (1.1%) of the 92 nasopharyngeal aspirates was positive for EV109 collected from a 2.5-year-old child in January, 2007. The main symptoms were dropping nose, fever (38.1°C), hard cough and wheezing associated with bronchitis and pneumonia. Based upon the VP1 gene region EV109 (L87/HUN/2007, JN900470) has 93% nucleotide identity and identical recombinant pattern to the prototype EV109. This is the first detection of the novel recombinant enterovirus, EV109, in Hungary (in Europe). This study supports the possibility that EV109 is able to cause acute respiratory infections, in addition, it might be plays a part in lower respiratory disease with hospitalization in children.",

    "abstract": "Lipases catalyze the hydrolysis and the synthesis of esters formed from glycerol and long chain fatty acids. Lipases occur widely in nature, but only microbial lipases are commercially significant. In the present study, thirty-two bacterial strains, isolated from soil sample of a hot spring were screened for lipase production. The strain TS-4, which gave maximum activity, was identified as Geobacillus sp. at MTCC, IMTECH, Chandigarh. The isolated lipase producing bacteria were grown on minimal salt medium containing olive oil. Maximal quantities of lipase were produced when 30 h old inoculum was used at 10% (v/v) in production medium and incubated in shaking conditions (150 rpm) for 72 h. The optimal temperature and pH for the bacterial growth and lipase production were found to be 60°C and 9.5, respectively. Maximal enzyme production resulted when mustard oil was used as carbon source and yeast extract as sole nitrogen source at a concentration of 1% (v/v) and 0.15% (w/v), respectively. The different optimized reaction parameters were temperature 65°C, pH 8.5, incubation time 10 min and substrate p-nitrophenyl palmitate. The Km and Vmax values of enzyme were found to be 14 mM and 17.86 μmol ml-1min-1, respectively, with p-nitrophenyl palmitate as substrate. All metal ions studied (1 mM) increased the lipase activity.",

Although first-line antimicrobial agents have been demonstrated to be predominantly successful in the treatment of C. trachomatis infection, treatment failures have been observed in some cases. Rich source of antimicrobial peptides was recently discovered in Medicago species, which act in plants as differentiation factors of the endosymbiotic bacterium partner. Several of these symbiotic plant peptides have proved to be potent killers of various bacteria in vitro . We show here that 7 of 11 peptides tested exhibited antimicrobial activity against C. trachomatis D, and that the killing activity of these peptides is most likely due to their interaction with specific bacterial targets.",

    "abstract": "The unicellular ciliate, Tetrahymena has a complete hormonal system. It has receptors for receiving hormones, produces, stores and secretes hormones, similar to mammalian ones and has signal transduction pathways, for transmitting the information given by the hormones. The first encounter with a hormone provokes the hormonal imprinting under the effect of which the further encounters with the same hormone induces altered (usually enhanced) reaction (hormone binding, hormone synthesis, chemoattraction, movement, growth etc.). The effect of imprinting is durable, it can be observed also after 1000 generations, or after one year in non-dividing cells. Receptors of the nuclear envelope also can be imprinted. The plasma membrane receptors provoked by imprinting are similar to the receptors of mammals. Although steroid hormones are not present in Tetrahymena , the production of them and their receptors can be induced by imprinting. The hormonal imprinting is an epigenetic process and inhibition of DNA-methylation alters the imprinting. Hormonal imprinting in Tetrahymena was likely the first epigenetic phenomenon which was justified at cellular level. It is very useful for the unicells, as it helps to avoid dangerous molecules more easily or to find useful ones and by this contributes to the permanence of the population’s life.",

The study included 83 carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates producing oxacillinase-48 (OXA-48) and 30 carbapenem-sensitive Enterobacteriaceae isolates. Out of the total isolates studied, 77 isolates (92.77%) were identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae and six isolates (7.23%) were identified as Escherichia coli by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method used to detect resistance genes found that 74 isolates (89.16%) produced OXA-48 carbapenemase, whereas nine isolates (10.84%) produced both OXA-48 and New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1). The isolates producing both OXA-48 and NDM-1 were found to be positive by both phenotypic tests. Among isolates carrying only blaOXA-48 gene alone, nine isolates (13.04%) for CarbaNP test and two isolates for CIM test (2.90%) displayed false negative results, respectively. The sensitivity of CarbaNP and CIM tests was found to be 89.16% and 97.59%, respectively, whereas the specificity was determined to be 100% for both tests. These findings suggest that CarbaNP and CIM tests are useful tools to identify the carbapenemase producers. Molecular methods like PCR are recommended to verify false negative tests predicted to have OXA-48 activity.",

The anti-biofilm activity of EOs was determined by Microtiter-Plate Test (MtP) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The QS and CS inhibitory activities were determined on the pre-grown biofilm by gene expression analysis using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis, the major components of the tested EOs were detected. The MtP and SEM detected a significant inhibitory effect of the three EOs on biofilm formation at sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). The most anti-biofilm activity was seen for T. daenensis. LuxS and pfs genes (genes involved in QS) downregulated the following treatment with MIC/2 of Thymus and Satureja EOs. Thymol, carvacrol, p-cymene, pulegone, and 1,8-cineole were the major components of the tested EOs. The used EOs seem to be good candidates for preventing biofilm formation and subsequent colonization of S. pneumoniae .

Twenty-one A. baumannii isolates were collected, most of them (76.2%) were extensively drug-resistant (XDR) and only one isolate (4.8%) was pandrug-resistant (PDR). All isolates showed high level of resistance to ciprofloxacin, while qnrA , qnrB and qnrS were absent among our isolates. This is the first report of A. baumannii isolates co-harboring Ser81Leu in gyrA and Ser84Leu in parC together with the novel abaQ gene. Interestingly, a new mutation in gyrA quinolone resistance-determining region Arg89Cys was detected among two of our isolates. The emergence of XDR and PDR isolates among A. baumannii causing VAP is an alarming threat.",

The aim of this study was the detection of circoviruses in neglected host species, including honey bees, exotic reptiles and free-living amoebae by widely used broad-spectrum polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays specific for the replication initiation protein coding gene of these viruses. The majority of sequences obtained from honey bees were highly similar to canine and porcine circoviruses, or, were distantly related to dragonfly cycloviruses. Other rep sequences detected in some honey bees, reptiles and amoebae showed similarities to various rep sequences deposited in the GenBank. Back-to-back PCR primers designed for the amplification of whole viral genomes failed to work that suggested the existence of integrated rep -like elements in many samples. Rolling circle amplification and exonuclease treatment confirmed the absence of small circular DNA genomes in the specimens analysed. In case of honey bees Varroa mite DNA contamination might be a source of the identified endogenous rep -like elements. The reptile and amoebae rep -like sequences were nearly identical with each other and with sequences detected in chimpanzee feces raising the possibility that detection of novel or unusual rep -like elements in some host species might originate from the microbial community of the host.

However, there was a significant difference between the TB patient and controls for –611 alleles of IFN-γR1 (P = 0.01). Additionally, the frequency of P2X7 gene polymorphisms (SNP-762 and 1513) between patients and controls was statistically significant.

Bacterial colonization of the infant gut is influenced by several factors, of which the most important are the mode of delivery and breast-feeding. Breast-fed infants ingest several grams of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) per day, which can become receptor decoys for intestinal bacteria. The most abundant intestinal bacteria in vaginally delivered infants are bifidobacteria, whereas infants born by cesarean section are colonized by clostridia. The influence of HMOs on the adhesion of five strains of intestinal bacteria (three bifidobacterial strains and two clostridial strains) to mucus-secreting and non-mucus-secreting human epithelial cells was investigated. Bifidobacterium bifidum 1 and Bifidobacterium longum displayed almost the same level of adhesion in the presence and absence of HMOs. By contrast, adhesion of Clostridium butyricum 1 and 2 decreased from 14.41% to 6.72% and from 41.54% to 30.91%, respectively, in the presence of HMOs. The results of this study indicate that HMOs affect bacterial adhesion and are an important factor influencing bacterial colonization of the gut.

    "abstract": "Silver is used extensively in both hospitals and outpatient clinics as a disinfectant coating agent on various devices. Resistance to silver was recently reported as an emerging problem in Enterobacteriaceae. Multidrug-resistant high-risk clones of Klebsiella pneumoniae are common causes of serious healthcare-associated infections worldwide posing a serious threat to patients. In this study, we investigated the capacity of both high-risk (CG14/15 and CG258) and minor clone strains of K. pneumoniae to develop resistance to silver. Resistance was induced in vitro in silver-susceptible but otherwise multidrug-resistant clinical isolates. Genetic alterations in the silver-resistant derivative strains with regard to the silver-susceptible isolates were investigated by whole-genome sequencing. The transferability of high-level resistance to silver was also tested. We demonstrated that the high-level resistance to silver can quickly evolve as a consequence of a single-point mutation either in the cusS gene of the chromosomally encoded CusCFBARS efflux system and/or in the silS gene of the plasmid-encoded Copper Homeostasis and Silver Resistance Island (CHASRI) coding also for a metallic efflux. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the strains increased from 4 mg/L (23.5 μM) AgNO3 to >8,500 mg/L (>50,000 μM) AgNO3 during induction. Harboring the CHASRI proved an important selective asset for K. pneumoniae when exposed to silver. Successful conjugation experiments using Escherichia coli K12 J5-3Rif as recipient showed that high-level silver resistance can transmit between strains of high-risk clones of K. pneumoniae (ST15 and ST11) and isolates from additional species of Enterobacteriaceae. The lack of fitness cost associated with the carriage of the CHASRI in a silver-free environment and the presence of the RelEB toxin-antitoxin system on the conjugative plasmids could advance the dissemination of silver resistance. Our results show that multidrug-resistant high-risk clones of K. pneumoniae are capable of evolving and transmitting high-level resistance to silver. This observation should warrant a more judicious use of silver coated-devices to prevent the extensive dissemination of silver resistance.",

This study aimed at delineating the prevalence, antimicrobial resistance, and biofilm-forming potentials of nasally colonized MRSA among HIV patients in the Arba Minch province of Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was performed in HIV patients who visit anti-retroviral therapy clinic of the Arba Minch Hospital between February and April 2017. Nasal samples were collected and inspected for Staphylococcus following standard procedures. MRSA was identified using cefoxitin disk and antibiotics sensitivity test was performed as per Kirby–Baur disk diffusion method. The formation of biofilm was inspected using both qualitative and quantitative methods. A total of 307 HIV patients were examined. The overall prevalence of S. aureus was found to be 39.7%. The prevalence of MRSA was 20.8%. The rate of nasal colonization of MRSA was relatively higher among females. In bivariate analysis, MRSA colonization was statistically significant in patients with CD 4 count ≤350 ( p value = 0.002) and co-trimoxazole prophylaxis ( p value = 0.003). Concomitant resistance to erythromycin, tetracycline, and co-trimoxazole were 48.4%, 45.3%, and 39.0%, respectively. Invariably, all MRSA isolates were 100% sensitive to vancomycin. Of the 64 MRSA isolates, 18.7% were considered as multidrug-resistant. The rate of biofilm formation was 34.3%. The results revealed a high prevalence rate in the nasal colonization of MRSA in HIV patients.",

    "abstract": "Implants have been considered the treatment of choice to replace missing teeth, unfortunately, peri-implant disease is still an unresolved issue. Contaminated implants may be decontaminated by physical debridement and chemical disinfectants; however, there is a lack of consensus regarding the ideal techniques/agents to be used for the decontamination. The objective of our study was to compare the decontaminating efficacy of different chemical agents on a titanium surface contaminated with Porphyromonas gingivalis, a typical representative of the bacterial flora associated with peri-implantitis. Commercially pure Ti grade 4 discs with a polished surface were treated with a mouthwash containing chlorhexidine digluconate (0.1%), povidone-iodine (PVP-iodine) solution (10%) or citric acid monohydrate (40%). Qualitative and quantitative assessment of cellular growth and survival were assessed by a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Significant differences in the quantity of P. gingivalis could be observed after 6 days of incubation. A numerical, but not statistically significant (P = 0.066) decrease in the amount of living bacteria was observed in the group treated with the PVP-iodine solution as compared to the control group. The chlorhexidine (CHX)-treated group presented with significantly higher cell counts, as compared to the PVP-iodine-treated group (P = 0.032), while this was not observed compared to the control group and citric acid-treated group. Our results have also been verified by SEM measurements. Our results suggest that for P. gingivalis contamination on a titanium surface in vitro, PVP-iodine is a superior decontaminant, compared to citric acid and chlorhexidine-digulconate solution.",

Detection of bla OXA-48 , bla KPC , bla NDM-1 , bla IMP , bla VIM-1 and mcr-1 , -2, -3 , -4, -5 , -6, -7, and -8 genes was performed by PCR. The bacterial isolates were assigned to clonal lineages by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). All isolates harbored bla OXA-48 and only two isolates harbored bla OXA-48 , and bla NDM-1 genes together. In colistin resistant K. pneumoniae , mcr - 1 was detected in two (2.1%) isolates. Ninety three isolates of K. pneumoniae were categorized into three clusters and five pulsotypes. MLST revealed two different sequence types, ST101 (89/93) and ST147 (4/93). In our study ST101 was found to be a significantly dominant clone carrying bla OXA-48 and among our strains a low frequency of mcr-1 gene was determined. The emergence of colistin resistance was observed in K. pneumoniae ST101 isolates. ST101 may become a global threat in the dissemination of carbapenem and colistin resistance.",

Our aim was to screen the presence of aflatoxigenic fungi in maize fields throughout the seven geographic regions of Hungary. Fungi belonging to Aspergillus section Flavi were isolated in the ratio of 26.9% and 42.3% from soil and maize samples in 2013, and these ratios decreased to 16.1% and 34.7% in 2014. Based on morphological characteristics and the sequence analysis of the partial calmodulin gene, all isolates proved to be Aspergillus flavus, except four strains, which were identified as Aspergillus parasiticus. About half of the A. flavus strains and all the A. parasiticus strains were able to synthesize aflatoxins. Aflatoxigenic Aspergillus strains were isolated from all the seven regions of Hungary. A. parasiticus strains were found in the soil of the regions Southern Great Plain and Southern Transdanubia and in a maize sample of the region Western Transdanubia. In spite of the fact that aflatoxins have rarely been detected in feeds and foods in Hungary, aflatoxigenic A. flavus and A. parasiticus strains are present in the maize culture throughout Hungary posing a potential threat to food safety.",

    "abstract": "Escherichia coli has developed sophisticated means to sense, respond, and adapt in stressed environment. It has served as a model organism for studies in molecular genetics and physiology since the 1960s. Stress response genes are induced whenever a cell needs to adapt and survive under unfavorable growth conditions. Two of the possible important genes are rpoS and bolA. The rpoS gene has been known as the alternative sigma (σ) factor, which controls the expression of a large number of genes, which are involved in responses to various stress factors as well as transition to stationary phase from exponential form of growth. Morphogene bolA response to stressed environment leads to round morphology of E. coli cells, but little is known about its involvement in biofilms and its development or maintenance. This study has been undertaken to address the adherence pattern and formation of biofilms by E. coli on stainless steel, polypropylene, and silicone surfaces after 24 h of growth at 37 °C. Scanning electron microscopy was used for direct examination of the cell attachment and biofilm formation on various surfaces and it was found that, in the presence of bolA, E. coli cells were able to attach to the stainless steel and silicone very well. By contrast, polypropylene surface was not found to be attractive for E. coli cells. This indicates that bolA responded and can play a major role in the presence and absence of rpoS in cell attachment.",

Minimal inhibitory concentration values of ceftazidime, cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam, C/A and C/T were determined by broth microdilution method and gradient diffusion test. Carbapenem inactivation method (CIM) test was performed on all isolates. Carbapenemase-encoding bla VIM , bla IMP , bla KPC , bla OXA-48-like and bla NDM genes were identified by multiplex PCR. Of the isolates tested, 33.6% and 32.4% showed resistance to C/A and C/T, respectively. According to the CIM test results, 26% of the isolates were classified as carbapenemase producers. The susceptibility of P. aeruginosa isolates to C/A and C/T without carbapenemase production was 89% and 91%, respectively. Of the CIM-positive isolates, 80% were positive for bla VIM and 11% for bla NDM . The prevalence of Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase (VIM)-type carbapenemase was 20.8%. NDM was present in 2.8% of the isolates. Although the rate of carbapenemase-producing P. aeruginosa strains is high, a negative CIM result indicates that either C/A or C/T could be effective even if carbapenem resistance has been observed.",

In the current study, we investigated molecular mechanisms involved in colistin resistance in A. baumannii isolates from different clinical samples. A total of 110 clinical A. baumannii isolates were collected from two hospitals in Tehran. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by broth microdilution according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. For the ColR isolates, mutation was detected in pmrA , pmrB , lpxA , lpxC , and lpxD genes using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Moreover, the relative expression of the pmrC gene was calculated using quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Three colistin resistant isolates were identified with MIC between 8 and 16 μg/mL and were resistant to all the tested antimicrobial agents. All the three isolates had a mutation in the pmrB , pmrA , lpxA , lpxD , and lpxC genes. Moreover, the overexpression of pmrC gene was observed in all isolates. Our results showed that the upregulation of the PmrAB two component system was the primary mechanism linked to colistin resistance among the studied colistin resistant A. baumannii isolates.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Bacteria can enhance their survival by attaching to inanimate surfaces or tissues, and presenting as multicellular communities encased in a protective extracellular matrix called biofilm. There has been pronounced interest in assessing the relationship between the antibiotic resistant phenotype and biofilm-production in clinically-relevant pathogens. The aim of the present paper was to provide additional experimental results on the topic, testing the biofilm-forming capacity of Escherichia coli isolates using in vitro methods in the context of their antibiotic resistance in the form of a laboratory case study, in addition to provide a comprehensive review of the subject. In our case study, a total of two hundred and fifty ( n = 250) E. coli isolates, originating from either clean-catch urine samples ( n = 125) or invasive samples ( n = 125) were included. The colony morphology of isolates were recorded after 24h, while antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Biofilm-formation of the isolates was assessed with the crystal violet tube-adherence method. Altogether 57 isolates (22.8%) isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR), 89 isolates (35.6%) produced large colonies (&gt;3 mm), mucoid variant colonies were produced in 131 cases (52.4%), and 108 (43.2%) were positive for biofilm formation. Biofilm-producers were less common among isolates resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole ( P = 0.043 and P = 0.023, respectively). Biofilms facilitate a protective growth strategy in bacteria, ensuring safety against environmental stressors, components of the immune system and noxious chemical agents. Being an integral part of bacterial physiology, biofilm-formation is interdependent with the expression of other virulence factors (especially adhesins) and quorum sensing signal molecules. More research is required to allow for the full understanding of the interplay between the MDR phenotype and biofilm-production, which will facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",

Carbapenem-resistant hvKP (CR-hvKP), multidrug-resistant hvKP (MDR-hvKP), extensively drug-resistant hvKP (XDR-hvKP), and pandrug-resistant hvKP (PDR-hvKP) were determined by disc diffusion method, Carba-NP test and PCR method. XDR-hvKP isolates were typed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Among all K. pneumoniae isolates 14 (26.9%) were identified as hvKP and 78.6% (11/14) of them were hmKP however, none of the classic K. pneumoniae (cKP) isolates were hmKP. The predominant capsular serotype of hvKP was K2 (42.85%) followed by K1 (35.71%). The prevalence of MDR-hvKP, XDR-hvKP and PDR-hvKP isolates were 6 (42.9%), 5 (35.7%) and 1 (7.1%), respectively. ESBL production was found in 85.7% of hvKP isolates and most of them carried bla TEM gene (78.6%) and 6 isolates (42.9%) were CR-hvKP. Among hvKP isolates, 1 (7.1%), 2 (14.3%), 3 (21.4%), 8 (28.6%), and 11 (78.6%) carried bla NDM-6, bla OXA-48, bla CTX-M, bla SHV, and bla TEM genes, respectively. According to MLST analysis, 2, 1, 1, and 1 XDR-hvKP isolates belonged to ST15, ST377, ST442, and ST147, respectively. The occurrence of such isolates is deeply concerning due to the combination of hypervirulence and extensively drug-resistance or pandrug-resistance.",

A single-centre, prospective, observational cohort study was carried out among consecutive adult (≥18 years of age) in-patients with COVID-19 between April 1 and December 31, 2020. The primary endpoint was 28-day all-cause mortality. The changes in laboratory parameters from baseline on day 7 and 14 after administration of tocilizumab were analysed.In total, 1801 patients were admitted to our centre during the study period. One hundred and six patients received tocilizumab, and among them 62 (58.5%) required intensive care unit admittance while 25 (23.6%) deceased. At day 7 after tocilizumab administration, inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6, ferritin) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) values were significantly lower among survivors. Subsequently, at day 14, differences of IL-6 and LDH levels has become more pronounced between subgroups. Restoration of absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) by day 7 and 14 was insufficient among patients who died.In our cohort, administration of high-dose tocilizumab for COVID-19 patients with CRS demonstrated clinical and sustained biochemical parameter improvement in 76.4%. In this patient population high and increasing LDH, IL-6, and low ALC levels had a predictive role for mortality.",

However, the recent emergence of colistin resistance (ColR) worldwide that severely restricts therapeutic options is a serious threat to global public health. In this study we have investigated the molecular determinants in ColR K. pneumoniae isolates collected from clinical specimens. A total of 98 E. coli and 195 K. pneumoniae clinical isolates were collected from two hospitals from August 2018 to December 2019 in Tehran, Iran. Colistin susceptibility and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute by disk diffusion method, and microdilution method, respectively. For isolates with colistin MIC ≥4 μg mL-1, PCR was performed for the detection of mcr-1 to mcr-4 genes. Moreover, nucleotide sequences of mgrB, phoP, phoQ, pmrA, and pmrB genes were determined by sequencing. Finally, the transcriptional level of pmrK and pmrC genes was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). None of the E. coli isolates were resistant to colistin while 21 out 195 K. pneumoniae isolates were identified as resistant, 19 of which carried mutation in the mgrB gene. Three different mutations were observed in the pmrB gene in 3 K. pneumoniae isolates. None of the ColR isolates showed alternations in pmrA, phoP, and phoQ genes. Furthermore, none of the plasmid-encoding genes were detected. Transcriptional level of the pmrK gene increased in all ColR isolates meanwhile, pmrC overexpression was detected in 16 out 21 (76.19%) isolates. Eventually, all ColR isolates were susceptible to tigecycline. Our results demonstrated that the alternation of mgrB gene is the main mechanism related to colistin resistance among ColR K. pneumoniae isolates in this study.",

The methodology included: PCR amplification, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and crystal violet microtiter plate assay for biofilm quantification. The overall incidence of BAG was: spgM 98.6%, rmlA 86%, and rpfF 66.5%. The most prevalent genotype was spgM+/rmlA+/rpfF+ (56.1%), followed by spgM+/rmlA+/rpfF- (28.5%), and spgM+/rmlA-/rpfF+ (9.5%), with their significant predominance in lower respiratory tract isolates compared to those with other origin (P < 0.001). All strains examined were characterized as strong biofilm producers (OD550 from 0.224 ± 0.049 to 2.065 ± 0.023) with a single exception that showed a weak biofilm-forming ability (0.177 ± 0.024). No significant differences were observed in the biofilm formation according to the isolation source, as well as among COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 isolates (1.256 ± 0.028 vs. 1.348 ± 0.128, respectively). Also, no correlation was found between the biofilm amounts and the corresponding genotypes. WGS showed that the rmlA accumulated a larger number of variants (0.0086 per base) compared to the other BAG, suggesting no critical role of its product to the biofilm formation. Additionally, two of the isolates were found to harbour class 1 integrons (7-kb and 2.6-kb sized, respectively) containing sul1 in their 3' conservative ends, which confers sulfonamide resistance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on S. maltophilia biofilm formation in Bulgaria, which also identifies novel sequence types (ST819, ST820 and ST826). It demonstrates the complex nature of this adaptive mechanism in the multifactorial pathogenesis of biofilm-associated infections.",

    "abstract": "Klebsiella pneumoniae is a major human pathogen, because it causes both community- and hospital-acquired infections. Several multidrug-resistant high-risk clones of K. pneumoniae have been reported worldwide, and these are responsible for high numbers of difficult-to-treat infections. In Greece, a K. pneumoniae ST39 high-risk clone was detected in 2019 in a survey of carbapenem- and/or colistin-resistant Enterobacteriacae. The present study included nine carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) isolates collected during a retrospective analysis from October 2020 to December 2020. They were isolated from nine different patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a hospital in Volos, Greece, and they were selected for analysis due to their phenotypic profile. In this study, we analyzed A165 strain K. pneumoniae ST39 isolated from a blood culture in November 2020. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed using Ion Torrent Platform, and resistance genes, virulence determinants, capsular types, insertion sequences, phage regions, and clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR) regions were detected by bioinformatic analysis. The molecular characterization revealed antimicrobial resistance genes, including sul2 for sulfamethoxazole; dfrA1 for trimethoprim; blaVIM-1 and blaKPC-2 for carbapenems; aac(6')-II for aminoglycosides; fosA for fosfomycin and aad1 for streptomycin, blaSHV-40, blaSHV-85, blaSHV-79, blaSHV-56, and blaSHV-89 for beta-lactams. Point mutations were identified in ompK36, and ompK37 and in acrR, gyrA, parC. Several replicons were found, including CoIRNA, IncC, IncFIB(K), IncFIB(pQiL), and IncFII(K). The capsular typing revealed that the strain was KL23, O2afg. The genome sequence of A165 was submitted to NCBI under PRJNA1074377 and have been assigned to Genbank accession number JAZIBV000000000.",

The aim of this study was to investigate efficacy of ceftazidime/avibactam and plazomicin on carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli isolates. Susceptibility of imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem, ceftazidime/avibactam and plazomicin was investigated by broth-microdilution method. Major carbapenemases NDM, VIM, IMP, KPC, OXA-48 as well as other β-lactamases namely, TEM, SHV, OXA-1-like, CTX-M, ACC, FOX, MOX, DHA, CIT, EBC, VEB, GES, PER were investigated by PCR. A total of 120 carbapenem-resistant isolates (60 E. coli and 60 K. pneumoniae) were included in this study and blaOXA-48-like was found in 78.33%, blaNDM in 26.66%, blaKPC in 7.5%, blaIMP in 5.83%, and blaVIM in 5%. Among 94 isolates with the blaOXA-48-like gene, 22.3% were resistant to ceftazidime/avibactam and 51.1% were resistant to plazomicin. Of 32 isolates with blaNDM, 31 (96.9%) were resistant to ceftazidime/avibactam and 30 (93.75%) were resistant to plazomicin, and both antibiotics had limited effects against blaNDM carriers (P < 0.001).

The effect of both antibiotics was significantly lower in strains with blaNDM+OXA-48 combination (P < 0.005).The most common carbapenemase genes in this study were blaOXA-48-like and blaNDM. Ceftazidime/avibactam demonstrated a good efficacy among OXA-48 producing K. pneumoniae and E. coli, however, plazomicin had a significantly lower antibacterial effect in our study.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, phenotypic assays for carbapenemase activity, PCR screening, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and phylogenomic analysis were performed. Seven of the CRPA isolates investigated (Minimum inhibitory concentration values of imipenem and meropenem >32 mg L-1) were also resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, ceftazidime-avibactam, cefepime, ceftolozane-tazobactam, amikacin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin, but were susceptible to colistin (0.5-2 mg L-1) and cefiderocol (0.25-1 mg L-1). The P. aeruginosa Pae57 isolate (designated Pae57) remained susceptible to aminoglycosides as well. WGS uncovered the co-existence of blaNDM-1 and blaGES-1. The isolates belonged to the ST654 high-risk clone, except for Pae57 (ST611). Alignment against reference sequences revealed the presence of a Tn21 transposon harboring bleMBL-blaNDM-1-ISAba125. It was similar to that found in the P. aeruginosa ST654 NDM1_1 strain (GCA_020404785.1) from Serbia. Phylogenomic analysis of our isolates indicated that seven of them (ST654) differed from each other in no more than 44 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Pae57 (ST611) was strikingly different (>21,700 SNPs) compared to all Balkan strains. In conclusion, to our knowledge this is the first report of blaNDM-1-positive P. aeruginosa ST611 isolation, which indicates the transmission dynamics of this determinant between high-risk and potentially high-risk P. aeruginosa clones. Obtained results unveil the dissemination of clonally related NDM-1-producing P. aeruginosa strains in the monitored hospital for approximately a 2-year period.",

    "abstract": "Oral Squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the 14th most frequent cancer with 300,000 new cases and 100,000 deaths reported annually. Even with advanced therapy, the treatment outcomes are poor at advanced stages of the disease. The diagnosis of early OSCC is of paramount clinical value given the high mortality rate associated with the late stages of the disease. Recently, the role of microbiome in the disease manifestation, including oral cancer, has garnered considerable attention. But, to establish the role of bacteria in oral cancer, it is important to determine the differences in the colonization pattern in non-tumour and tumour tissues. In this study, 16S rRNA based metagenomic analyses of 13 tumorous and contralateral anatomically matched normal tissue biopsies, obtained from patients with advanced stage of OSCC were evaluated to understand the correlation between OSCC and oral microbiome. In this study we identified Fusobacterium, Prevotella, Capnocytophaga, Leptotrichia, Peptostreptococcus, Parvimonas and Bacteroidetes as the most significantly enriched taxa in OSCC lesions compared to the non-cancerous tissues. Further, PICRUSt2 analysis unveiled enhanced expression of metabolic pathways associated with L-lysine fermentation, pyruvate fermentation, and isoleucine biosynthesis in those microbes associated with OSCC tissues. These findings provide valuable insights into the distinctive microbial signatures associated with OSCC, offering potential biomarkers and metabolic pathways underlying OSCC pathogenesis. While our focus has primarily centred on microbial signatures, it is essential to recognize the pivotal role of host factors such as immune responses, genetic predisposition, and the oral microenvironment in shaping OSCC development and microbiome composition.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Urinary tract infections are becoming difficult to treat every year due to antibiotic resistance. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) isolates pose a threat with a combined expression of multidrug-resistance and biofilm formation. ST131 clone is a high-risk pandemic clone due to its strong association with antimicrobial resistance, which has been reported frequently in recent years. This study aims to define risk factors, clinical outcomes, and bacterial genetics associated with ST131/O25b UPEC. In this study, antibiotic susceptibility and species-level identification of 61 clinical E. coli strains were determined by automated systems. Detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases was assessed by double-disk synergy test. Biofilm formation was quantified by spectrophotometric method. Virulence genes ( iutA, sfa cnf-1, iroN, afa, papA, fimA ), antibiotic resistance genes ( bla CTX-M , bla TEM , bla SHV , bla OXA , qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, ant(2′)-Ia, ant(3)-Ia, aac(3)-IIa, mcr-1, mcr-2, mcr-3, mcr-4 ) were investigated by PCR. The following beta-lactamase genes were identified, bla TEM ( n = 53, 86.8%), bla CTX-M ( n = 59, 96.7%), bla SHV ( n = 47, 77.0%), and bla OXA-1 ( n = 27, 44.2%). Our data revealed that 93.4% of (57/61) E. coli isolates were biofilm-producers. O25pabBspe and trpA2 were investigated for the presence of ST131/O25b clone. Among multidrug resistant isolates, co-existence of O25pabBspe and trpA2 was detected in 29 isolates (47.5%). The fimH30 and H30Rx subclones were detected in four isolates that are strong biofilm-producers. These results suggest that clinical E. coli strains may become reservoirs of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. This study demonstrates a significant difference in biofilm formation between E. coli ST131 and non-ST131 isolates. Moreover, 86.21% ( n = 25) of ST131 isolates produced strong to moderate biofilms, while only 43.75% ( n = 14) of non-ST131 isolates showed the ability to form strong biofilms. Presence of iutA and fimA genes in the majority of ST131 strains showed an important role in biofilm formation. These findings suggest application of iutA and fimA gene suppressors in treatment of infections caused by biofilm-producing drug-resistant ST131 strains.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Klebsiella pneumoniae is a major pathogen associated with hospital-acquired infections, particularly those involving multidrug-resistant strains. Carbapenem resistance, often driven by carbapenemases such as KPC, VIM, OXA-48, and NDM, poses a significant challenge in clinical settings. This study reports on K. pneumoniae strain A165, isolated from a blood culture of a 51-year-old female patient hospitalized for respiratory distress post-SARS-CoV-2 infection. This K. pneumoniae strain exhibited resistance to several antibiotics, including carbapenems, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones, but remained susceptible to gentamicin, colistin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Next-generation sequencing was performed on Ion torrent platform, that revealed a genome size of 5,676,404 bp, including a chromosome and six plasmids. The strain was classified as sequence type 11 (ST11), a high-risk lineage associated with carbapenem resistance. The resistome of A165 included multiple β-lactamase genes, such as bla NDM-1 and bla OXA-48 , as well as genes conferring resistance to other antibiotic classes. The virulome analysis identified genes involved in iron acquisition (yersiniabactin operon genes: ybtE , ybtT , irp1 , irp2 ; aerobactin receptor: iutA ), adhesion ( mrkA-J , fimA-K ), capsule and biofilm formation ( rcsA , rcsB , ompA ) and resistance to complement ( traT ) contributing to its pathogenic potential. The mobilome analysis revealed nine insertion sequences, including IS Kpn1, IS Kpn18, IS Kpn43, IS Kpn28, IS Kpn14, IS Ecp1, and IS 6100. The strain also harbored six replicons: Col440II, ColRNAI, IncFIA(HI1), IncFIB(K), IncFII(K), and IncR, which are associated with the horizontal transfer of resistance and virulence genes. Comparative analysis with global isolates demonstrated the widespread dissemination of carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae , with notable occurrences in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. This study highlights the growing concern of multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae in hospital settings and emphasizes the need for robust surveillance and infection control measures.",

    "abstract": "The identification of Ganoderma species is usually based on classical morphological criteria. The objectives of this review were to collect available information on Ganoderma lucidum and to utilize them in exact identification of Ganoderma lucidum (Fr.) Karst. sensu stricto. A lot of taxonomical confusion has always been associated with G. lucidum and allied species. Species circumscription, phylogenetic relationships, host range and distribution of species of the G. lucidum complex are unclear even among the few taxa living in temperate climate. Several methods have been proposed to identify the species as examination of cultural characteristics, isozymes, secondary metabolites, DNA sequences and interfertility. Although G. lucidum sensu stricto has been reported world-wide accumulated evidence supported the suggestion that it seems restricted to Europe. The strains used in the medicine are usually collected in Asia. There is little likelihood that any one belongs to the G. lucidum sensu stricto. The strains labelled as G. lucidum in the medicinal and pharmacological literature encompass a broad range of species which produce different medicinally active compounds and have significantly different pharmacological effects.",

    "abstract": "Various bacterial plasmids can be eliminated from bacterial species cultured as pure or mixed bacterial cultures by non-mutagenic heterocyclic compounds at subinhibitory concentrations. For plasmid curing, the replication should be inhibited at three different levels simultaneously: the intracellular replication of plasmid DNA, partition and intercellular transconjugal transfer. The antiplasmid action of the compounds depends on the chemical structure. The targets for antiplasmid compounds were analysed in detail. It was found that amplified extrachromosomal DNA in the superhelical state binds more drug molecules than does the linear or open-circular form of the plasmid or the chromosome, without stereospecificity which leads to functional inactivation of the extrachromosomal genetic code. Plasmid elimination also occurs in ecosystems containing numerous bacterial species simultaneously, but the elimination of antibiotic resistance-encoding plasmids from all individual cells of the population is never complete. The medical significance of plasmid elimination in vitro is, it provides a method to isolate plasmid-free bacteria for biotechnology without any risk of mutations, and it opens up a new perspective in rational drug design against bacterial plasmids. Hypothetically, the combination of antiplasmid drugs and antibiotics may improve the effectivity of antibiotics against resistant bacteria; therefore, the results cannot be exploited until the curing efficiency reaches 100%. Inhibition of the conjugational transfer of antibiotic resistance plasmids can be exploited to reduce the spreading of these plasmids in ecosystems.",

Carbon and nitrogen source utilization experiments revealed that all of the strains were able to utilize a series of basic amino acids both as sole carbon and nitrogen sources. The MIC values of the tested antifungal drugs were found to be 0.016-8 µg/ml for amphotericin B, 64-256 µg/ml for fluconazole, 0.5-32 µg/ml for itraconazole and 0.008-1 µg/ml for ketoconazole in the case of the examinedis olates. Metabolites of the strains inhibited the growth of different bacteria, furthermore, compounds produced by three clinical isolates reduced the motility of boar spermatozoa, indicating their toxicity to mammalian cells as well. On the whole, there were no significant differences in the examined features between strains derived from clinical or soil samples. The question, however, whether all environmental Trichoderma longibrachiatum strains have the capacity to cause infections or not, remains still unanswered.",

Accordingly, we tested by means of PCR and immunohistochemistry the presence of these pathogens in the same atherosclerotic carotid specimen. The histology of the samples and the patients' antibodies against these pathogens were evaluated. Further, we examined the impact of C. pneumoniae and HCMV infection on the gene expression of the human monocytic cell line U937. Six of the 22 samples contained only C. pneumoniae, 4 contained only HCMV, 7 contained both C. pneumoniae DNA and/or antigens of both pathogens, and 5 samples were negative. No correlation was found between the presence of these microbes and either the cellular structure of the plaques, or the serostatus of the patients. The infection of U937 cells with HCMV and especially C. pneumoniae induced inflammation and atherosclerosis-related genes. Furthermore, the doubly-infected cells produced higher levels of the mRNA of pro-platelet basic protein and fatty acid binding protein 4. In conclusion, C. pneumoniae is often present in combination with HCMV in atherosclerotic carotid lesions. The in vitro coinfection model reveals that the doubly-infected monocytes are potent expressors of proatherosclerotic genes, suggesting that this coinfected population may accelerate the process of atherosclerosis.",

Lactobacillus acidophilus AA11 produced higher antimicrobial activity with a wide range of inhibition. The agent AA11 was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and retained full activity after 30 min at 100 degrees C. Activity against sensitive cells was bactericidal but not bacteriolytic. The compound was produced during growth phase and could be extracted from the culture supernatant fluids with n-butanol. 12% SDS-PAGE analysis of 40% ammonium sulphate precipitated agent showed two peptides with molecular weights of approximately 36 kDa and approximately 29 kDa. No plasmid was identified in Lactobacillus acidophilus AA11 indicating that the genes encoding the inhibitory agent were located on the chromosome. These characteristics identify the inhibitory substance as a bacteriocin, designated acidocin AA11 and confer the agent an application potential as a biopreservative.",

Immobilization of polygalacturonase on activated polyethylene and its use in apple juice clarification was not reported so far. Aspergillus niger Van Tieghem (MTCC 3323) produced polygalacturonase when grown in modified Riviere’s medium containing pectin as single carbon source by fed-batch culture. The enzyme was precipitated with ethanol and purified by gel filtration chromatography (Sephacryl S-100) and immobilized onto glutaraldehyde-activated polyethylene. The method is very simple and time saving for enzyme immobilization. Various characteristics of immobilized enzyme such as optimum reaction temperature and pH, temperature and pH stability, binding kinetics, efficiency of binding, reusability and metal ion effect on immobilized enzymes were evaluated in comparison to the free enzyme. Both the free and immobilized enzyme showed maximum activity at a temperature of 45 °C and pH 4.8. Maximum binding efficiency was 38%. The immobilized enzyme was reusable for 3 cycles with 50% loss of activity after the third cycle. Twenty-four U of immobilized enzyme at 45 °C and 1 h incubation time increased the transmittance of the apple juice by about 55% at 650 nm. The immobilized enzyme can be of industrial advantage in terms of sturdiness, availability, inertness, low price, reusability and temperature stability.",

In Egypt, infectious intestinal diseases are the major cause of hospitalization in almost all regions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the microbiological quality of treated and untreated water samples from urban and rural communities. Thirty-five samples of treated (chlorinated) water from taps, 25 samples of bottled water and 15 samples of hand pump (untreated) water collected from different cities alongside the River Nile during the winter of 2007 were bacteriologically tested for safety as drinking water. This study indicated good quality of tap water and bottled water. The untreated water samples (hand pumps) were, however, slightly contaminated by faecal coliforms, faecal enterococci, Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella and Shigella. Consequently, the consumers in the villages receiving water through hand pumps are often exposed to the risk of water-borne diseases due to inadequate treatment of the raw water. Therefore, there are guidelines necessary to protect groundwater quality. Moreover, PCR-amplified by some functional gene fragments such as dctA, dcuB, frdA, dcuS and dcuR genes of the E. coli was adapted for use as a non-cultivation-based molecular approach for detection of E. coli populations from water samples without the need for pure and identified cultures.",

Cefepime, imipenem and meropenem had the lowest MIC90 values. Piperacillin/tazobactam and clarithromycin had the highest MIC90 values. Imipenem, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam and clarithromycin had the lowest MBIC90 values.For biofilm-forming P. aeruginosa strains 2-fold to 128-fold higher MBIC values than MIC values were obtained for ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, amikacin and netilmicin. The MBIC was 2-fold to 512-fold lower then the MIC values in the case of piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and clarithromycin.Synergy was generally demonstrated for clarithromycin in combination with aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones or ceftazidime. However, surprisingly it was found that combinations of clarithromycin with carbapenems or cefepime led to an antagonistic interaction: combination of clarithromycin with imipenem, meropenem or ertapenem showed antagonism in 37.5%, 50% and 62.5% of the strains tested whereas its combination with cefepime expressed antagonism in 75% of the strains, respectively.

PCR amplification is a good tool for this purpose, but choosing proper target is of a great concern. We describe a PCR assay for fast detection of M. tuberculosis and M. bovis.As a BLAST and BLASTP search we selected regulatory gene whiB7 that encodes multi-drug resistance in this bacterium. Thirty clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis were sequenced and all the mutations in gene whiB7 were detected. The best set of several pairs of primers was selected and used in comparison by rpoB gene for differentiation of M. bovis, M. avium, M. kansasii, M. phlei, M. fortuitum, M. terrae, seven non-pathogenic Mycobacterium isolates and 30 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis.It was proved that only clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis and M. bovis have positive bands of 667 bp whiB7. Other non-tuberculous and non-pathogenic isolates did not show any positive sign. Furthermore, 667-bp PCR products of whiB7 gene were observed for ten positive sputum samples (preliminarily approved to be positive for M. tuberculosis by commercially real-time based method), but no bands were detected in 5 negative sputum samples. RpoB gene could not differentiate non-tuberculous strains and non-pathogenic isolates from pathogenic clinical isolates. We concluded that PCR amplification of the gene coding for the WhiB7 protein could be successfully used as a good tool for rapid identification of M. tuberculosis and M. bovis. We propose application of this method as a rapid and simple approach in mycobacteriological laboratories.",

In this study, we performed an oligonucleotide microarray screening of 780 inflammation-associated genes in HCMV-infected aortic SMC (AoSMC). The expression of 31 genes was stimulated and 24 genes were down-regulated following infection with HCMV strain DC-134. Following infection with HCMV strain AD-169 infection, we found 24 genes to be stimulated and 32 genes to be down-regulated. Among these were primarily genes encoding for CC and CXC chemokines, adhesion molecules, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily members, apoptosis-related factors, signal transduction molecules and transcription regulators. The up-regulated genes included matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and MMP-3 in HCMV infected cells. Using RT-PCR and enzyme immunoassay we found stimulated expression of MMP-1 (3.2-fold expression) and MMP-3 (334-fold expression) in HCMV strain DC-134-infected AoSMC at 72 h following infection.The findings of our study suggest that HCMV infection of AoSMC cause an activation of atherosclerosis-relevant factors in SMC. The increased expression of MMPs which have been shown to be involved in atherosclerotic plaque rupture and myocardial infarction is in agreement with the hypothesis that this pathogen might contribute to plaque inflammation in atherosclerotic disease.",

In our study, refined saltless water (UPW) produced for the boiler of a Hungarian power plant was examined before and after storage (sampling the inlet [TKE] and outlet [TKU] waters of a storage tank) with cultivation and culture independent methods. Our results showed increased CFU and direct cell counts after the storage. Cultivation results showed the dominance of aerobic, chemoorganotrophic α -Proteobacteria in both samples. In case of TKU sample, a more complex bacterial community structure could be detected. The applied molecular method (T-RFLP) indicated the presence of a complex microbial community structure with changes in the taxon composition: while in the inlet water sample (TKE) α -Proteobacteria ( Sphingomonas sp., Novosphingobium hassiacum ) dominated, in the outlet water sample (TKU) the bacterial community shifted towards the dominance of α -Proteobacteria ( Rhodoferax sp., Polynucleobacter sp., Sterolibacter sp.), CFB (Bacteroidetes, formerly Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides group) and Firmicutes. This shift to the direction of fermentative communities suggests that storage could help the development of communities with an increased tendency toward corrosion.",

    "abstract": "Legionella pneumophila is an important etiological agent in both hospital and community acquired pneumonia. The sensitivity of culture for isolation of L. pneumophila from clinical specimens is low and time consuming. Similar problem also exists when the method of direct immunofluorescence is used. To detect this organism quantitatively from respiratory specimens, a Taq Man based real-time PCR targeting the mip sequence was developed. Both real-time PCR and culture methods were applied on 262 respiratory specimens from 262 ICU patients with pneumonia admitted to 5 different hospitals in Tehran. The results of real-time PCR were compared with those obtained by culture. Real-time PCR and culture found 12 and 4 specimens, respectively, as positive for L. pneumophila . Its technical specificity (100%) was checked against a panel of microorganisms consisting of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Our real-time PCR assay showed high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (96.9%) and could detect 200 organisms per ml from respiratory specimens. Using real-time PCR as a screening method, the frequency of nosocomial pneumonia with L. pneumophila at Tehran hospitals was estimated as 4.58%.",

In wet laboratory experiments, two key genes of GSH metabolism, gcsA, and glrA, encoding γ-l-glutamyl-l-cysteine synthetase and glutathione reductase, respectively, were deleted. The gene gcsA was essential, and the ΔgcsA mutant required GSH supplementation at considerably higher concentration than the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gsh1 mutant (8-10 mmol l-1 vs. 0.5 μmol l-1). In addition to some functions known previously, both genes were important in the germination of conidiospores, and both gene deletion strains required the addition of extra GSH to reach wild-type germination rates in liquid cultures. Nevertheless, the supplementation of cultures with 10 mmol l-1 GSH was toxic for the control and ΔglrA strains especially during vegetative growth, which should be considered in future development of high GSH-producer fungal strains. Importantly, the ΔglrA strain was characterized by increased sensitivity toward a wide spectrum of osmotic, cell wall integrity and antimycotic stress conditions in addition to previously reported temperature and oxidative stress sensitivities. These novel phenotypes underline the distinguished functions of GSH and GSH metabolic enzymes in the stress responses of fungi.",

Recent studies have claimed that similar phenomenon was observed in humans, but no relevant studies have been performed to validate this finding.

To provide a more precise estimation of the association and a more reliable conclusion on this subject, we performed this meta-analysis. Relevant literatures were identified in multiple databases and selected based on strict screening. T. gondii-type proportions among different severities of infection were calculated and compared using Fisher's exact test. Pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated. Our results showed that the difference among T. gondii-type proportions was significant (p < 0.0001). In addition, significant associations were detected between Type I strains infection and congenital toxoplasmosis (OR: 1.91, p = 0.0009), Type III strains infection and pulmonary toxoplasmosis (OR: 5.15, p = 0.04). In our subgroup analysis, Type I strains were significantly associated with cerebral toxoplasmosis in offspring (OR: 1.81, p = 0.02). This result indicated that different types of T. gondii exhibited different virulence and caused different outcomes in humans.",

A total of 250 samples were taken from different surfaces and medical devices of three hospitals in Isfahan, Iran. All samples were cultured and K. pneumoniae strains were identified by conventional microbiological methods and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Antibiogram of isolates was performed by disk diffusion method and production of carbapenemases and metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) was confirmed using modified Hodge test and E-test, respectively. Molecular detection of the related genes was carried out by PCR. Overall, 37 (14.8%) K. pneumoniae strains were isolated, of which 34 (91.9%) strains were resistant to carbapenems. Twenty-eight (82.4%) isolates were positive for carbapenemases and seven (20.6%) isolates were phenotypically MBL producers. The results of PCR showed that the prevalence of bla OXA-48 , bla NDM , bla IMP , bla SHV , bla CTX-M , bla TEM , and class 1 integron among CRKP isolates was 70.6%, 52.9%, 2.9%, 100%, 82.4%, 55.9%, and 76.5%, respectively.

This study focused on the optimization of DFO-E production by Streptomyces parvulus CBS548.68. Different combinations of various carbon and nitrogen sources as well as the addition of 3-morpholinopropane-1-sulfonic acid (MOPS) markedly affected DFO-E yields, which were attributed, at least in part, to the higher biomass productions found in MOPS-supplemented cultures. In MOPS-supplemented glucose and sodium glutamate medium, DFO-E productions as high as 2,009 ± 90 mg/l of culture medium were reached. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis demonstrated that a simple two-step purification process yielded DFO-E preparations with purities of ∼97%. Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry analysis showed that purified DFO-E always contained traces of desferrioxamine D2.",

    "abstract": "Phagocytosis is an ancient cell function, which is similar at unicellular and multicellular levels. Unicells synthesize, store, and secrete multicellular (mammalian) hormones, which influence their phagocytosis. Amino acid hormones, such as histamine, serotonin, epinephrine, and melatonin stimulate phagocytosis, whereas peptide hormones, such as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), insulin, opioids, arginine vasopressin, and atrial natriuretic peptide decreased it, independently on their chemical structure or function in multicellulars. Macrophage phagocytosis of multicellulars is also stimulated by amino acid hormones, such as histamine, epinephrine, melatonin, and thyroid hormones, however, the effect of peptide hormones is not uniform: prolactin, insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and leptin have positive effects, whereas ACTH, human chorionic gonadotropin, opioids, and ghrelin have negative ones. Steroid hormones, such as estrogen, hydrocortisone, and dexamethasone are stimulating macrophage phagocytosis, whereas progesterone, aldosterone, and testosterone are depressing it. Considering the data and observations there is not a specific phagocytosis hormone, or a hormonal regulation of phagocytosis neither unicellular, nor multicellular level, however, hormones having specific functions in multicellulars also influence phagocytosis at both levels universally (in unicellulars) or individually (in macrophages). Nevertheless, the hormonal influence cannot be neglected, as phagocytosis (as a function) is rather sensitive to minute dose of hormones and endocrine disruptors. The hormonal influence of phagocytosis by macrophages can be deduced to the events at unicellular level.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The spread of multi-drug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, constitutes a global threat. The most frequent mechanism of acquired carbapenem resistance is the production of carbapenemases, especially KPC, NDM, VIM, IMP and OXA-48. We analyzed the epidemiological trend of carbapenem resistance genes of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) strains isolated from critically ill patients in a Greek tertiary hospital. The study included 150 CRKP isolates collected from 116 (77.4%) patients hospitalized in the adult ICU and 17 (11.3%) each in the pediatric and the two neonatal ICUs between March 2018 and March 2021. Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed using VITEK-2. A multiplex lateral flow immunoassay was used for the detection of carbapenemases, while the detection of bla VIM , bla KPC , bla NDM , bla IMP and bla OXA-48-like genes was achieved by multiplex PCR. The bla NDM was mainly detected in adults (54/116, 46.9%), while in children the most often detected gene was bla KPC (24/34, 70.6%). The predominant carbapenem resistance gene during 2018–2019 was bla KPC alone or in combination with bla VIM , reaching 44.4% in 2019, while during 2020–2021 the detection of bla NDM prevailed significantly, reaching 45.5 and 60.7% for 2020 and 2021, respectively. A shift in the molecular epidemiology of CRKP was seen during 2018–2021, which is probably associated with the recent excessive empiric use of newer antimicrobials. Surveillance studies and proper and strict implementation of infection control measures are highly needed to decrease the spread of MDR bacteria, including CRKP.",

However, there have been only few studies about this infection in Thailand. In this study, we characterized 53 Trichosporon spp. isolated from urine samples from patients admitted to a single hospital in Bangkok, Thailand over a one-year period from 2019 to 2020. The strains were identified using colony morphology, microscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and nucleotide sequence analysis of intergenic spacer 1 (IGS1). Fifty-one isolates were Trichosporon asahii, and the remaining isolates were Trichosporon inkin and other Trichosporon species. Three genotypes of IGS1-1, 3, and 7 were observed among T. asahii. The sensitivity of the yeasts to the antifungal drugs amphotericin B, fluconazole, and voriconazole ranged from 0.25 to >16 μg ml-1, 0.5-8 μg ml-1, and 0.01-0.25 μg ml-1, respectively. We investigated biofilm formation by the isolates, and no biofilm production was found in one isolate, low biofilm production in forty-four isolates, and medium biofilm production in six isolates. T. inkin produced biofilms at low levels, and Trichosporon spp. produced biofilms at medium levels. This research increases our understanding of the molecular epidemiology of Trichosporon spp. isolated from one university hospital in Bangkok, Thailand, and reveals their genetic diversity, antifungal susceptibility profiles, and capacity for in vitro biofilm production.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study aimed the identification of anaerobic bacteria isolated from blood cultures and the determination of antibacterial susceptibility of the isolates. The study material comprised of 5,282 blood samples taken between 2018 and 2020. The samples were incubated in a BacT/ALERT system. The species identification of the isolates was performed by three methods namely, BBL Crystal Anaerobe system, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Antibacterial susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion method with benzylpenicillin, clindamycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, and metronidazole disks. In the BacT/ALERT system, 45 anaerobic bacterial isolates were recovered from 39 (0.74%) of the samples that showed growth signs in blood culture bottles. The BBL Crystal Anaerobe system and 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses enabled the genus and species identification of all 45 isolates (100%), whereas with MALDI-TOF MS, only 37 (82.2%) of the isolates were able to be identified. Antibacterial resistance rates of the isolates to piperacillin/tazobactam, clindamycin, benzylpenicillin, meropenem, and metronidazole were detected as 100%, 73.8%, 40%, 9.8%, and 5.5%, respectively. MALDI-TOF MS showed a higher level of compatibility with 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses, compared to the BBL Crystal Anaerobe system. The high rates of susceptibility to meropenem and metronidazole suggested that these antibiotics are options for the empirical treatment of anaerobic bacterial infections.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this study, we evaluated the performance of modified rapid antimicrobial susceptibility test (mRAST) with 150 mm Mueller Hinton Agar (MHA) plates which was earlier standardized for 90 mm MHA by EUCAST. Blood culture bottles spiked with ATCC quality control strains were prepared. For quality control Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 strains were used. By calculating and proportioning the surface areas of the plates comparing with 90 mm plates, 350 ± 50 µL undiluted blood culture samples were inoculated in 150 mm MHA, and 12 disks were placed. This process was repeated independently for three days and three times on each day for reproducibility. The mRAST test was performed on 50 samples with positive signals and gram-negative bacilli on Gram-stained samples (20 Klebsiella pneumoniae , 15 E. coli , 10 Acinetobacter baumannii , and five P. aeruginosa) . Comparison of 90 mm MHA and 150 mm MHA showed that the categorical agreement of ATCC strains and 50 gram negative isolates was 100% and &gt;95%, respectively, for all antibiotics. For K. pneumoniae , only 0.4 major error (ME) was detected at 4 h. For E. coli , 3.2, 1.6, and 1.5 ME were detected at 4, 8, and 20 h, respectively, whereas 1.6 very major error (VME) was detected at 4 h and 1.0 VME was detected at both 8, and 20 h, respectively. No errors were detected for P. aeruginosa or A. baumannii . These results indicated that 350 ± 50 µL of undiluted blood culture in 150 mm MHA was suitable for the mRAST test in vitro .",

Increased incidence of hypervirulent and drug-resistant Klebsiella causing life-threatening infections in young healthy individuals and asymptomatic carriage in the community has been largely reported in the Asian-Pacific Rim. This study conducted a molecular analysis of two morphologically distinct variants of K. pneumoniae that caused bacteremia and sepsis in a patient. Colony morphology of the isolates was characterized in various growth media, and the morphological variants differed in their mucoviscosity. The isolates were found to be serotype K2 (highly associated with hypervirulent Klebsiella ) by molecular serotyping using specific PCR primers. The multidrug-resistant nature of the colony variants was evaluated by antibiotic susceptibility testing and it was found to have a similar antibiogram pattern in in vitro . An increased minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of colistin (&gt;64 μg mL −1 ) was detected in both isolates using broth microdilution, and they were found to be highly resistant to colistin. Molecular analysis revealed that the isolates possessed a chromosomal mutation in mgrB , which causes colistin resistance. The increased incidence of infection caused by colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae requires continuous monitoring, and appropriate measures are necessary to control its adaptive evolution in healthcare settings.",

However, only few studies have been published in Mexico reporting the prevalence of this pathogen in food. Therefore, the objective of this current study is to evaluate the prevalence of L. monocytogenes in cheese sold in Tamaulipas, Mexico, and its potential risk to the population. For this purpose, samples were taken in 100 stores during the months of February, June and October 2023, and a total of 300 cheese products in 10 municipalities of Tamaulipas, Mexico were collected. Identification was performed by culture and PCR. Ten virulence factors were also analyzed and susceptibility testing to 14 antibiotics was performed. As a result, a prevalence of L. monocytogenes was detected in 12%. The most frequently detected virulence factors were act A (83.3%, 30/36) and hly (83.3%, 30/36). The strains were resistant to only 9 of the 14 antibiotics tested. The strains showed resistance in higher percentage to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (STX/TMP: 38.8%, 14/36), penicillin (PE: 16.6%, 6/36), tetracycline (TE: 13.8%, 5/36) and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (AMC: 13.8%, 5/36). The results of the current study show the presence of L. monocytogenes in cheese products sold in Tamaulipas, Mexico. The low prevalence of L. monocytogenes and low resistance to antibiotics could imply a low risk for public health. However, it is necessary to implement monitoring of L. monocytogenes in food, to monitor its potential risk for the consumer.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause infections especially in hospital settings and in immunocompromised individuals. Due to its resistance to many broad-spectrum antibiotics, treatment options that can be used in clinical practice are limited. This study aims to evaluate the susceptibility profiles of S. maltophilia isolates to antimicrobial agents commonly used in treatment and to investigate the presence of different classes of integrons and sul genes responsible for resistance. The study included 100 S. maltophilia isolates from various clinical samples sent to Balıkesir University Health Practice and Research Hospital Medical Microbiology Laboratory between 2017 and 2023. The BD Phoenix™ M50 Automated System was used for bacterial identification and antibiotic sensitivity testing. The susceptibility of isolates to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was also studied by disk diffusion method. All isolates were investigated for sul1, sul2 genes and integron-associated integrase genes by polymerase chain reaction. The susceptibility rates of isolates to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, levofloxacin and ceftazidime were determined as 96%, 66% and 38%, respectively. Polymerase chain reaction results showed, intI1 and sul1 genes were found to be positive together in two isolates resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, while sul1 and sul2 genes were found in two separate isolates sensitive to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The intI2 gene was not detected in any isolate. This study addresses the clinically important problems of S. maltophilia infections, which are increasingly difficult to treat due to intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms. By providing valuable information on antimicrobial susceptibility and resistance profiles of S. maltophilia isolates, it contributes to national data and guides efforts to control resistance and promote rational antibiotic use.",

    "abstract": "Products of avian origin are one of the major Salmonella reservoirs, responsible for serious public health concerns. Transmission and pathogenicity are mainly caused by molecular mechanisms, including chromosomal and plasmid-encoded virulence factors. This study aimed to perform phenotypic identification, antibiotic resistance profiling against 15 antibiotics, and characterization of virulence factors of 80 Salmonella strains (30 from human and 50 from poultry), collected in Annaba and Constantine regions in Algeria.Antibiogram analysis and simplex PCR revealed complete resistance to four antibiotics: Ampicillin, Penicillin, Cephalotin and Cephoxetin. In addition, four virulence genes (spvA, spiC, spvC and pefA) were detected. These genes were identified in isolates from both avian and human origins, with variations in their distrubition frequencies. This study highlights the significant role of avian-derived Salmonella as a reservoir of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes, posing a serious threat to public health.Antibiotic resistance profiling revealed that avian isolates exhibited complete resistance (100%) to ampicillin, penicillin and cephalothin, followed by a high resistance rate of 98% to cefalexin and ceftriaxone. Moderate resistance levels, ranging from 76% to 46%, were observed against streptomycin, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, kanamycin and nalidixic acid. In contrast, low resistance rates were reported for gentamicin, amikacin, and chloramphenicol, at 20%, 18%, and 16%, respectively.On the other hand, human isolates showed complete resistance (100%) to ampicillin, penicillin, cephalothin and cefalexin. Moderate resistance (76%-46%) was observed against ceftriaxone, kanamycin, cefotaxime, gentamicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol. Low resistance levels were detected for tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and amikacin, at 26%, 20%, and 6.6%, respectively.These findings along with the widespread presence of virulence genes (spvA, spiC, spvC, and pefA) in both human and poultry isolates, underscore the potential for cross-species transmission and the urgent need for enhanced surveillance. The regional findings from Annaba and Constantine emphasize the importance of stricter antibiotic use policies in poultry farming.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Bordetella pertussis , the pathogen responsible for a highly contagious respiratory disease, utilizes a broad spectrum of virulence factors that results in subacute or chronic cough. We conducted an analysis of pertussis incidence and reported cases in the European region from 2000 to 2024. We analyzed the potential factors contributing to the rise in pertussis incidence despite high vaccination rates. In 2024, the Slovak Republic and surrounding Central European countries (the Czech Republic, Austria, Hungary, Poland, and Ukraine) have seen a significant increase in pertussis incidence. The results of this study suggest that the resurgence of pertussis was likely due to multiple interacting factors including waning immunity in adults, the genomic changes of B. pertussis , the “immune debt” phenomenon following the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, the lower vaccination rate against pertussis due to refusal to be vaccinated, a shorter duration of protection offered by acellular vaccines, the transmission of B. pertussis from asymptomatic individuals or patients with mild infection to pertussis-susceptible individuals, as well as improved diagnostics and surveillance. Unimmunised or partially immunised infants are at the highest risk of severe pertussis. The most common sources of infection are family members with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic disease. All patients with chronic cough should be tested for B. pertussis as part of a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation. To protect newborns, booster vaccination of parents, close family contacts and certain healthcare professionals carrying for the youngest children is recommended. This strategy helps to create a protective environment around infants in the period of pertussis resurgence.",

A prospective cohort study was conducted on 450 participants: 300 adult patients with allergic rhinitis, who were eligible for AIT, and 150 healthy controls. The Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) and the Rhinitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) were used to assess symptom severity and the impact of AR on daily life. Blood and stool samples were collected at baseline and after six months of AIT for microbiome analysis. The stool samples were analyzed with the 16S rRNA gene V4 region, followed by sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. The microbial composition and diversity were assessed using the QIIME2 pipeline, and taxonomic assignments were made using the SILVA reference database. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were quantified using Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Flow cytometry was used to quantify T-regulatory cells (Tregs). Cytokine levels (IL-10, IL-4, IFN-γ) were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Allergic rhinitis patients and healthy controls were matched for age and weight; however, AR patients had a significantly higher BMI ( P = 0.0006). Baseline TNSS and RQLQ scores were significantly worse in AR patients compared to controls ( P &lt; 0.001), but both improved significantly after six months of AIT ( P &lt; 0.001). AR patients demonstrated reduced gut microbial diversity ( P = 0.028), distinct microbial profiles, and lower levels of SCFAs, indicative of dysbiosis. Immune markers in AR patients revealed lower levels of IL-10 and T-regulatory cells ( P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.001) and higher levels of IL-4 and Th2 cells ( P &lt; 0.001). Proteobacteria were associated with a decrease in TNSS and an improvement in RQLQ scores ( P &lt; 0.05). Allergen immunotherapy improves symptoms and quality of life in AR patients. This may potentially influence immune and microbial imbalances. Proteobacteria may have a protective role in allergic rhinitis, suggesting their potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target in the management of AR.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a wide range of cognitive, behavioural and communication impairments. Children with autism have a distinctive and underdeveloped range and volume of gut bacteria (microbiome) which is often not related to their diet. Evidence gathered throughout years of research suggests that the pathway between gut bacteria and the central nervous system, referred to as the gut-brain axis (GBA), has a profound effect on the social behaviours of autistic children. The gut microbiome has been shown to play a vital role in the manifestation of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms as gut dysbiosis - an imbalance in the gut microbiome - affects brain development through processes regulated by the neuroendocrine, neuroimmune and autonomic nervous systems. Although dysregulation of the gut microbiome and subsequent disruption of GBA are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of autism, the underlying mechanisms and the extent to which the microbiome contributes to neurodevelopmental disorders remain unclear. In this review, we focus on understanding the complex and multidirectional interplay between gut microbiota and ASD based on evidence mounted over the years. Furthermore, we examine how genomics, metabolomics and microbiome components can be integrated to unravel this multifactorial disorder. The ability to understand the underlying mechanisms involved in ASD will pave the way for future advancements in therapy and treatment.",

    "abstract": "Stenotrophomonas maltophilia has emerged as an opportunistic pathogen that causes life-threatening hospital-acquired infections. This microorganism possesses a diverse array of chromosome-encoded antimicrobial resistance genes, which render it inherently multidrug-resistant (MDR). Its ability to acquire additional antimicrobial resistance via mutations and the horizontal transfer of resistome elements from neighboring microbial communities has further contributed to the development of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) and even pandrug-resistant (PDR) strains. These strains are resistant to routinely used antibiotics, including the first-line drug trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole as well as levofloxacin and minocycline. Recently, cefiderocol - a siderophore-conjugated cephalosporin - was developed for clinical use. This antibiotic has shown high in vitro efficacy against clinically relevant MDR gram-negative pathogens. Cefiderocol efficiently transverses the outer membrane of bacteria via iron transport systems and exhibits high stability against β-lactamases. An injectable form of cefiderocol has received Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia, and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia caused by drug-resistant gram-negative bacteria. Clinical data on the use of cefiderocol for S. maltophilia infections remain limited, however, some in vitro, in vivo, and case studies have demonstrated its efficacy and successful treatment of MDR S. maltophilia infections. Given the narrow range of therapeutic options currently available, cefiderocol presents a promising alternative for the effective management of severe S. maltophilia infections. Nevertheless, the potential for the emergence of resistance remains a significant concern, as emerging evidence suggests that S. maltophilia may acquire resistance following exposure to this antibiotic.",

Resistance of Campylobacter to fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines, previously recommended for treatment of prolonged or complicated disease, has been emerging. We examined phenotypic resistance to erythromycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and imipenem in 150 Campylobacter isolates from human stool during 2010–2011 and the same number of strains during 2023–2024, using the antimicrobial gradient method in both periods, to determine minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Comparing the two periods, resistance rate of C. jejuni increased by 35% and 38.43% to tetracyclin and ciprofloxacin, respectively and decreased by 0.83% to erythromycin. Prevalence of resistance in C. coli increased by 42.59% and 42.01% against tetracyclin and ciprofloxacin, respectively and all isolates were sensitive to erythromycin. Resistance of C. jejuni to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid decreased by 0.96% and increased by 3.70% in C. coli . All isolates showed sensitivity for imipenem in both periods, while only 2% of C. jejuni strains were resistant to gentamicin in 2023–2024. The difference of mean MICs for all antibiotics was statistically significant in two examined periods, with exception of those for erythromycin both in C. jejuni and C. coli. In 2023–2024, 79 isolates of C. jejuni and 22 isolates of C. coli were resistant against two and more antibiotics, most frequently tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. The present study provides evidence that in Campylobacter spp. the antimicrobial resistance to ciprofloxacin and tetracycline is on rise in Serbia.

Among its lineages, Sequence Type 131 (ST131) has emerged as a globally disseminated, multidrug-resistant, high-risk clone with remarkable capacity for systemic infections. This study provides a comprehensive molecular epidemiological characterization of 160 clinical E. coli isolates, collected between 15.09.2021 and 28.02.2022, assessing antimicrobial resistance profiles, virulence gene carriage, phylogenetic group distribution, prevalence of ST131 and H30Rx subclone, and biofilm-forming capacity. Isolates were identified by conventional and automated methods, with molecular analyses performed via in-house PCR assays. Our results reveal a striking 69.38% prevalence of ST131, with 95.5% harboring virulence genes and 81.99% exhibiting biofilm formation. Notably, ST131-positive isolates demonstrated extensive resistance to multiple antimicrobial classes, including ESBL production, and were dominated by the H30Rx subclone. Specifically, 73.87% of ST131 isolates were ESBL-positive, fluoroquinolone resistance was observed in 81.37%, while aminoglycoside resistance rate remained very low. The H30Rx subclone was strongly associated with ESBL positivity and multidrug resistance. Moreover, integron carriage diversity and strong association with fimA virulence gene further highlight the adaptive versatility of this clone. Given that ST131 and its H30Rx subclone are recognized as global pandemic lineages associated with multidrug resistance and severe infections, their detection in our cohort emphasizes both the clinical relevance and the public health risk posed by these clones. Our findings underscore the urgent need for targeted surveillance and control strategies, offering novel epidemiological insights into the molecular diversity and clinical threat posed by E. coli ST131 in Turkey.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a malignant disease associated with substantial morbidity and mortality rates, and the implementation of early screening has been shown to greatly enhance survival outcomes. Currently, early screening methods for CRC rely on stool-based tests and colonoscopy; however, the limited adherence of patients to these screening protocols hinders their widespread adoption. The utilization of innovative microbiological sequencing technique known as 2bRAD-M holds promise for the detection of low biomass samples. In this study, the 2bRAD-M technique was employed to ascertain a diverse microbiota consisting of different microorganisms in the serum of patients diagnosed with CRC, as well as in the serum of healthy control individuals. This study included 3 patients with non-metastatic CRC and 3 healthy individuals. Additionally, the microbiota present in CRC tumor tissues and paraneoplastic tissues were also examined. Furthermore, the metabolic pathways of these microorganisms were predicted. The findings indicated that the microbiota community structures in serum and tissues were distinct, while the microbiota composition in tumor tissues and adjacent tissues was largely similar. Microbiota in serum such as Enterobacteriaceae and tissue-associated RC9、Ralstonia may serve as novel biomarkers for CRC screening. Our results suggest that both serum microbiota and cancer tissue microbiota can serve as a valuable basis for conducting early in vitro screening for CRC.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study evaluates the impact of psychosomatic interventions on the immune system and microbiome composition of pregnant women diagnosed with gestational hypertension. A case-control study on 200 pregnant women diagnosed with gestational hypertension was conducted between June 2021 and December 2024. The control group ( n = 100) included pregnant women diagnosed with gestational hypertension and under only pharmacological treatment with antihypertensive drugs such as labetalol. The case group ( n = 100) received standard care for hypertensive disorders in pregnancy like control group, but in addition to it, we incorporated evidence based psychosomatic medicine to this group. Psychosomatic medicine included stress management, relaxation techniques, and counseling for the study group. Primary outcomes included blood pressure levels, psychological state (SAS and SDS scores), mode of delivery, incidence of complications, neonatal outcomes, patient satisfaction, reductions in inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TNF-alpha), and improvements in microbiome diversity. Psychosomatic intervention led to a significant increase in microbiome diversity (Shannon Index, P &lt; 0.05). Beta-diversity analysis revealed a distinct separation in microbial community composition between the study and control groups ( P = 0.02). The case group also showed a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 decreased from 40.0 to 28.0 pg mL −1 ( P = 0.008) and TNF-alpha from 25.0 to 18.0 pg mL −1 ( P = 0.004). The case group demonstrated significant improvements in systolic ( P = 0.020) and diastolic ( P = 0.003) blood pressures, psychological well-being (SAS, P = 0.006; SDS: P = 0.026), and delivery outcomes ( P = 0.032). Complications were significantly lower in the case group ( P = 0.013), with better neonatal outcomes, including lower rates of intrauterine distress ( P = 0.011), premature birth ( P = 0.003), and asphyxia ( P = 0.013). Emotional resilience, coping confidence, and patient satisfaction were significantly higher in the case group ( P &lt; 0.05). These findings suggest that psychosomatic medicine may offer a novel approach for managing gestational hypertension through microbiome modulation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite the clinical importance of the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections especially in pregnant women and immunocompromised patients, there are only a few CMV seroprevalence studies in certain risk groups from Hungary. In this study, the results of CMV-specific IgG antibody tests were analysed by calendar year, gender, and 5-year age groups (from 0 to 97) among the population of South Transdanubia, Hungary from blood samples ( N = 13,777), between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2024, covering 15-years. The average CMV-specific IgG seropositivity was 69.2% (9,522/13,761 patients), which increased with age between 31 and 50 years (+∼1%/year). Seroprevalence was lowest (37.8%) in the 1–5 age group, reached 50% in the 21–25 age group, and exceeded 80% in those over 50 years. In certain age groups (16–20, 26–30, 46–50, 51–55, and 66–70 years old), CMV seroprevalence was significantly higher among women. Women of child-bearing age between 16 and 45 years showed 61.2% seroprevalence. Between 2020 and 2023, the yearly CMV seroprevalence decreased (from 70.8 to 64.7%) by ∼6%. This summary of CMV IgG seroprevalence fills gaps in terms of both the number of elements, the size of the studied population, and its age diversity in Hungary. The average CMV seropositivity in South Transdanubia follows the level of socio-economic development of the countries. Basic knowledge of CMV seroepidemiological data helps physicians with CMV risk assessment and find the optimal infection prevention strategies in different age and sex groups.",

The study was performed between December 2023 and June 2024 at the University Hospital “Saint Marina”, Varna, Bulgaria. A total of 180 HM patients were screened for intestinal colonization by 3rd generation cephalosporin-resistant (3rdGCephR) and carbapenem-resistant (CR) Enterobacterales , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Stenotrophomonas maltophilia , Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE) and Candida sp. according to our own protocol. Blood cultures were taken according to clinical indications. Multiplex PCR was used to detect beta-lactamase genes in all invasive Enterobacterales isolates. A total of 100 patients (55.6%) were colonized by one or more of the screened agents. Among these, 88 patients were MDR carriers (48.9%, 88/180) and the highest colonization rates were found for CR Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) (42%), Candida sp. (34%), VRE (25%) and 3rdGCephR Escherichia coli (23%). A total of 29 patients (16.1%; 29/180) developed BSIs, with K. pneumoniae responsible for 44.8%. Of these, 76.9% (10/13) were CR and bla NDM positive isolates. Related BSIs were diagnosed in 57.9% of the MDR carriers with BSIs (11/19). The related BSIs percentage according to the colonizing agent was 21.4% for CRKP (9/42), 7.1% for 3rdGCephR K. pneumoniae (1/14) and 25% for P. aeruginosa (1/4). CRKP colonization was significantly higher among patients with CRKP BSIs than those with non-CRKP BSIs ( P &lt; 0.001). The MDR intestinal colonization, specifically by CRKP is an important source for subsequent BSIs in this high-risk patient population.",

Five of the members with RA were diagnosed by using the revised 1987 ACR criteria, and 1 member suffered from SLE.The variations in the TNF-alpha and the HSP70-2 genotypes were analyzed by PCR-RFLP, using NcoI and PstI restriction enzymes.Two of the 29 members were homozygotes for allele A, 18 were heterozygotes (TNF A/G) and 9 of them were homozygotes for allele G. Nineteen of the 29 were heterozygotes for HSP70-2 (A/G), 10 of them were homozygotes for the G allele, and none were homozygotes for allele A. Four of the 5 the RA patients carried the A allele for TNF-alpha all 5 were heterozygotes for HSP70-2 genotypes.The carriage of the A allele for TNF-alpha of -308 SNP in 4 of the 5 RA patients, and the high prevalence (68.0%) of TNF A allele carriers in this family confirms the important role of this candidate gene in the pathomechanism of RA, and might be of prognostic value for future clinical observations. Further, to test for association a much larger set of genetically independent patients and controls is needed.",

    "abstract": "Murine herpes virus (MHV), a natural pathogen originally isolated from free-living rodents, constitutes the most amenable animal model for human gamma herpesviruses. Based on DNA sequence homology, this virus was classified as Murid Herpesvirus 4 to subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae. Pilot studies in our laboratory, using mice inoculated by the intranasal route, showed that MHV infects macrophages, B lymphocytes, lung alveolar as well as endothelial cells. From the lungs the virus spreads via the bloodstream to spleen and bone marrow and via the lymphatics to the mediastinal lymph nodes. Similarly to other gamma herpesviruses, MHV established life-long latency maintained in host B lymphocytes and macrophages. An IM-like syndrome (per analogy to EBV) may develop during acute MHV infection, in which the atypical T/CD8+ lymphocytes eliminate viral DNA carrying B cells expressing the M2 latency associated protein. During latency, the MHV LANA (a KSHV LANA homologue) maintains the latent viral genome, assuring its copying and partition to new carrier cells in the course of division of the maternal cell. The nonproductive latency is turned onto virus replication by means of Rta protein. The chronic lymphoproliferative syndrome of unclear pathogenesis, which occurs in a certain part of latent MHV carriers, is related to the expression of gamma herpesvirus common latency-associated genes such as v-cyclin and/or to that of a virus-specific (M11/bcl-2) gene. This review attempts to summarize our knowledge concerning the function of MHV genes (either gamma herpesvirus common or MHV specific) related to immune evasion, latency and lymphoproliferation when highlighting the unsolved problems and/or controversial opinions.",

Because it is not simply distinguished from normal flora by simple laboratory methods, modern molecular diagnostic assays are necessary. Although it is neither necessary nor applicable to perform PCR for all patients, it is of many advantages to verify the prevalence of DEC in different areas by this method. Knowing the prevalence of DEC in an area, we can focus on few pathogens and narrow our antimicrobial treatment. The aim of this study is to evaluate the contribution of the different DEC categories in children diarrhoea in the west of Iran.The stool specimens of 251 children with diarrhoea were collected from June to September 2007. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to determine the presence of enteropathogenic (EPEC), enterotoxigenic (ETEC), entero-invasive (EIEC), Shiga toxin-producing (STEC) and entero-aggregative (EAEC) strains. ETEC strains were isolated from 13 and EAEC strains from 16 children. STEC was detected in 7 children, and no EIEC was isolated. Finally, EPEC strains were isolated in 41 cases. EAEC and EPEC are the most frequent DECs in children less than 10 years of age in West of Iran.",

    "abstract": "Thirty-three Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, resistant to one or more β-lactams, were included in this study. Identification of tested strains was confirmed using MALDI-TOF/MS. Phenotypic and genotypic β-lactamase patterns were investigated. Most of the isolates were resistant to carbapenems (32 out of 33) and to the extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESC) (30 out of 33). Phenotypically, the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), metallo-β-lactamases (MBL), and carbapenemases was detected in 10, 23, and 9 isolates, respectively. However, AmpC hyperproduction was not phenotypically detected among all isolates. Genotypically, ESBL and MBL encoding genes were detected in 23 and 27 isolates, respectively. Altogether 27 strains were detected as blaVIM positive and 16 strains carried blaOXA-10 gene. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of P. aeruginosa clinical isolates harboring blaVEB together with blaGES in Egypt, where 5 of our 30 ESC-resistant isolates showed this genotype. Our results confirmed that resistance of P. aeruginosa isolates to β-lactam antibiotics is mediated via multiple β-lactamases belonging to different molecular classes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of blaVEB among P. aeruginosa clinical isolates from Egypt. Ten isolates harbored blaVEB and five of them co-harbored blaVEB together with blaGES, blaVIM, and blaOXA-10.",

    "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori positivity was assessed among 656 symptomatic children in 2010–2017. Overall infection prevalence was 24.5% and a significantly higher rate was detected in girls (28.5%) compared to boys (20.0%). Moreover, in children with duodenal ulcer, H. pylori prevalence was higher (47.4%) compared with the rest (23.9%). On the contrary, the infection was detected 1.9-fold less frequently in patients with GERD (14.5%) compared with the other (27.0%) patients and 2.1-fold less often in the presence of duodenogastric reflux (bile) reflux (13.0%) compared with the absence of the reflux (27.0%). No significant difference was observed between the younger (aged ≤7 years, 20.0%) and the older (aged 8–18 years, 25.5%) patients. H. pylori infection rate in Bulgarian pediatric patients between 2010 and 2017 was 2.5-fold lower than that in 1996–2006. In conclusion, H. pylori infection is still an important concern for Bulgarian children, although having decreased by about 1.8%/yearly over 21 years. This study reveals the importance of H. pylori diagnostics even in the youngest symptomatic children and demonstrates an inverse association between either GERD or bile reflux and H. pylori infection.",

According to sequencing analysis, the isolates related to T4 (77.7%) and T2 (22.3%) genotypes were reported. It was revealed by thermo- and osmotolerance tests in which six strains are extremely pathogenic. To our knowledge, the pathogenic Acanthamoeba was potentially isolated initially from dust phenomenon in Ilam Province.

In our laboratory, three isolates were identified as N. meningitidis by Bruker MALDI Biotyper (BD, USA) between April 2018 and March 2019 from clinical specimens of blood, sputum, and urine. 16S rRNA sequencing was performed for further investigation. Two of the isolates were identified as Neisseria subflava and only one was confirmed as N. meningitidis by sequencing. These results show that MALDI-TOF MS is not always reliable in the diagnosis of N. meningitidis and clinical microbiologists should confirm these results with additional tests. Also, clinical correlations should be determined. Accurate identification of this microorganism is very important because of the necessity of prophylactic antimicrobial usage and biosafety precautions. Enlarged databases of Neisseria species are needed to overcome this problem.",

The goals of this study were to determine the pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility, blaOXA and carO genes among burn-isolated A. baumannii strains. In this study, 100 A. baumannii strains were isolated from burn patients and their susceptibilities to different antibiotics were determined using disc diffusion testing and broth microdilution. Presence of carO gene and OXA-type carbapenemase genes was tested by PCR and sequencing. SDS-PAGE was done to survey CarO porin and the expression level of carO gene was evaluated by Real-Time PCR. A high rate of resistance to meropenem (98%), imipenem (98%) and doripenem (98%) was detected. All tested A. baumannii strains were susceptible to colistin. The results indicated that 84.9% were XDR and 97.9% of strains were MDR. In addition, all strains bore blaOXA-51 like and blaOXA-23 like and carO genes. Nonetheless, blaOXA-58 like and blaOXA-24 like genes were harbored by 0 percent and 76 percent of strains, respectively. The relative expression levels of the carO gene ranged from 0.06 to 35.01 fold lower than that of carbapenem-susceptible A. baumannii ATCC19606 and SDS - PAGE analysis of the outer membrane protein showed that all 100 isolates produced CarO. The results of current study revealed prevalence of blaOXA genes and changes in carO gene expression in carbapenem resistant A.baumannii.",

In 130 cases neurological symptoms were recorded, in 123 cases the infection presented in skin related signs including hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), herpangina and rash. In 2010 EV-A71 was found to cause the majority of diagnosed EV infections while in 2011 and from 2014-2018, Coxsackievirus (CV)-A6 was identified most often. Echovirus E6 accounted for the most cases in 2012 and Echovirus 30 dominated in 2013. EV-D68 was identified only in 2010 and 2013.Widespread circulation of several EV-A and EV-B viruses with occasional occurrence of EV-C and EV-D was detected. The ability of EVs to cause severe infections in sporadic cases and regular outbreaks highlight the importance of continued monitoring of circulating EV types.",

This study examines whether the presence of dentin powder influences the antibacterial efficacy of ClO 2.In an in vitro dentin powder model the following irrigants were tested against planktonic E. faecalis: 2% chlorhexidine (CHX), 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), 0.12%ClO2 (Solumium) and one local root canal medicament: saturated Ca(OH)2. Survival of bacteria exposed to agents without and with human dentin powder or preincubated with dentin powder was investigated. The effect of the dentin powder on ClO2 concentration was investigated by titrations.Without dentin powder ClO 2 killed all E. faecalis and delivered the best result already after 1 minute; however, after longer contact time with dentin the difference between the disinfectants disappeared. The presence of dentin powder decreased the concentration of ClO 2 and attenuated the antibacterial efficiency of ClO2 and Ca(OH)2, but did not decrease of CHX and NaOCl.Preincubation with dentin powder caused significant loss of antibacterial activity of all investigated agents, ClO2 and Ca(OH)2 having the highest reduction.As the presence of dentin powder had a negative effect on the efficacy of disinfectants, the importance of elimination of dentin scrapings and smear layer from the root canal system during endodontic treatments is highly recommended. ClO 2 can be effective for a final rinse.",

    "abstract": "Nosocomial legionellosis is a growing concern worldwide. In Hungary, about 20% of the reported cases are health-care associated, but in the absence of legal regulation, environmental monitoring of Legionella is not routinely performed in hospitals. In the present study, 23 hospitals were investigated. The hot water distribution system was colonized by Legionella in over 90%; counts generally exceeded the public health limit value. Hot water temperature was critically low in all systems (&lt;45 °C), and large differences (3–38 °C temperature drop) were observed within buildings, indicating insufficient circulation. Most facilities were older than 30 years (77%); however, new systems (n = 3) were also shown to be rapidly colonized at low hot water temperature. Vulnerable source of drinking water, complex distribution system, and large volume hot water storage increased the risk of Legionella prevalence (OR = 28.0, 27.3, 27.7, respectively). Risk management interventions (including thermal or chemical disinfection) were only efficient if the system operation was optimized. Though the risk factors were similar, in those hospitals where nosocomial legionellosis was reported, Legionella counts and the proportion of L. pneumophila sg 1 isolates were significantly higher. The results of environmental prevalence of legionellae in hospitals suggest that the incidence of nosocomial legionellosis is likely to be underreported. The observed colonization rates call for the introduction of a mandatory environmental monitoring scheme.",

In Iran, there are only few reports on the prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance genes among A. baumannii isolates. The aim of this study was to investigate the existence of aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme (AME) genes from A. baumannii strains collected at a university teaching hospital in Iran. One hundred A. baumannii strains were collected between 2014 and 2015 from hospitalized patients at Loghman Hakim Hospital, Tehran, Iran. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recommendations. The DNA was extracted using a kit obtained from Bioneer Co. (Korea) and was used as a template for polymerase chain reaction. The most active antimicrobial agent against these strains was colistin. The rate of extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance was 97%. The aadA1, aadB, aac(6')-Ib, and aac(3)-IIa genes were found in 85%, 77%, 72%, and 68% of A. baumannii isolates, respectively. This study showed a high prevalence rate of AME genes in A. baumannii. This prevalence rate has explained that further aminoglycoside resistance genes may have role in the resistance of clinical isolates of A. baumannii. Therefore, control and treatment of serious infections caused by this opportunistic pathogen should be given more consideration.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus saprophyticus is a well-known urinary pathogen in acute cystitis in young females. We completed a retrospective overview of the distribution of urinary tract infections (UTIs) occurring in 2014, at Semmelweis University hospitals and at Heim Pál Children's Hospital. Six age-groups (ages 0-100) were examined, with the frequency of S. saprophyticus in females being: 0.1% (0-4), 0.7%, (5-15), 7.4% (16-24), 1.2% (25-39), 0.4% (40-59) and 0.1% (60-100), and S. saprophyticus being the 3(rd) most common pathogen in females aged 16-24. In males, S. saprophyticus was only isolated from those aged 5-15. Seasonal distribution of UTIs caused by S. saprophyticus showed that most infections occurred during the months of January, June, August and November. Antibiotic-resistance rates of amoxicillin, clindamycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, gentamicin and sulfamethoxazole- trimethoprim varied as follows: 0.9%, 32.7%, 19.6%, 34.6%, 0.9% and 0.9%, respectively. Thirty randomly selected samples were analysed by pulsed-field gelelectrophoresis, and 28 different genotypes were identified. S. saprophyticus is involved in the pathogenesis of acute cystitis not only in young females, but also in other age-groups, and in young males as well. We did not find any significant seasonal occurrence in S. saprophyticus-caused UTIs. The infective strains were genetically diverse. Antibiotic-resistance does not pose any issue as of yet.",

    "abstract": "Cluster analysis plays a foremost role in identifying groups of genes that show similar behavior under a set of experimental conditions. Several clustering algorithms have been proposed for identifying gene behaviors and to understand their significance. The principal aim of this work is to develop an intelligent rough clustering technique, which will efficiently remove the irrelevant dimensions in a high-dimensional space and obtain appropriate meaningful clusters. This paper proposes a novel biclustering technique that is based on rough set theory. The proposed algorithm uses correlation coefficient as a similarity measure to simultaneously cluster both the rows and columns of a gene expression data matrix and mean squared residue to generate the initial biclusters. Furthermore, the biclusters are refined to form the lower and upper boundaries by determining the membership of the genes in the clusters using mean squared residue. The algorithm is illustrated with yeast gene expression data and the experiment proves the effectiveness of the method. The main advantage is that it overcomes the problem of selection of initial clusters and also the restriction of one object belonging to only one cluster by allowing overlapping of biclusters.",

Among them, IcaA and IcaB are critical proteins for synthesizing extracellular polysaccharides and biofilms in S. aureus . To investigate whether the formation of S. aureus biofilms can be inhibited through the IcaA and IcaB proteins by the presence of linezolid. Methods The icaA and icaB genes of S. aureus ATCC 25923 were silenced by homologous recombination. The critical roles of icaA and icaB in S. aureus were analysed by observing the growth curve and biofilm formation after linezolid treatment. Then, the effect of linezolid on the morphology of S. aureus was observed by scanning electron microscopy. Finally, the potential binding ability of linezolid to Ica proteins was predicted by molecular docking. Results The icaA- and icaB -silenced strains were successfully constructed, and the sensitivity of S. aureus to linezolid was decreased after icaA and icaB silencing. Scanning electron microscopy showed that linezolid caused invagination of the S. aureus surface and reduced the production of biofilms. Molecular docking results showed that linezolid could bind to IcaA and IcaB proteins. Conclusion IcaA and IcaB are potential targets of linezolid in inhibiting the biofilm formation of S. aureus (ATCC 25923).",

This study evaluated the distribution and expression of virulence genes and genotyping of E. coli O25b/ST131 by Multi-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) method among UTI in patients at Tehran hospitals, Iran.A total of 107 E. coli isolates were collected from UTI patients. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the pabB gene was used to identify E. coli O25b/ST131 and the prevalence of sat and hlyA virulence genes was also analyzed. The microtiter method quantified biofilm formation ability in E. coli O25b/ST131. The Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to evaluate the expression of sat and hlyA genes. Finally, MLVA was performed for E. coli O25b/ST131 genotyping by targeting seven tandem repeats. SPSS-16 software was used for statistical analysis. Molecular study showed that 71% of isolates carried the pabB gene and were considered E. coli O25b/ST131 strains. Also, 45.8% and 17.8% of isolates carried sat and hlyA genes, respectively. The 57.9% isolates had biofilm formation ability. Expression of the studied virulence genes showed an increase in strong biofilm producing E. coli O25b/ST131 strains. A total of 76 (100%) E. coli O25b/ST131 strains were typed by the MLVA method.High prevalence of E. coli O25b/ST131 isolates in UTI patients can be a serious warning to the treatment due to the high antibiotic resistance rate, expression of virulence genes, and biofilm formation.",

This phenotype is known in the literature as one of the virulence factors of this species together with the production of biofilm and other hypervirulence factor genes such as: rmpA, rmpA2, iucA, iroB, peg-344. We also investigated presence of magA gene that correlates with the hyper-production of capsule of K1 serotype. Of the strains under study, 13 out of 19 harboured at least one virulence factor.Sequence type (ST) was determined in order to identify known high-risk clones or new emerging high-risk clones and their variability in a single clinical setting. Important STs found among these strains were ST65 and ST29. Carbapenem resistance was also investigated and 4 out of 19 strains harboured at least a carbapenemase: one strain harboured a KPC enzyme alone, one strain carried a KPC and an OXA-48 like, one strain produced OXA-48-like alone, and the last strain harboured two metallo-β-lactamases (VIM-1 and NDM-5) plus OXA-48-like. In particular, this latter strain belongs to ST383, which was recently reported in Northern Italy as a hypervirulent and XDR strain.The global spread of hypervirulent K. pneumoniae is an important epidemiological issue that should be considered in diagnostic and therapeutic managements of patients with K. pneumoniae infections.",

    "abstract": "Prevalence of antibiotic resistant Helicobacter pylori was compared between 50 patients living outside the capital city and 50 matched pairs of capital city residents (CCRs). H. pylori isolates from 2018 to 2022 were included. Resistance rates in CCRs and those living elsewhere were 4.0 and 6.0% to amoxicillin, 48.0 and 42.0% to metronidazole, 30 and 30% to clarithromycin, and 4.0 and 4.0% to tetracycline, respectively. Levofloxacin resistance was higher (38.0%) in the capital city vs 20.0% (P = 0.047) in the country. Odd ratio for levofloxacin resistance between pair-matched groups was 2.45 (95% CI, OR 1.0-6.02, P value = 0.05) and relative risk for fluoroquinolone resistance was 1.90 (95% CI for RR 0.98-3.67) for CCRs vs residents in other regions. Resistance rates to levofloxacin and clarithromycin were worryingly high in our study, most probably due to the high quinolone consumption (2.86 DDD/day in 2017) in Bulgaria and the increase in macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin consumption, especially of azithromycin, by >42% with the start of COVID-19 pandemic. Briefly, antibiotic resistance of H. pylori has a dynamic change, and it can display different patterns in certain geographic regions. The results imply that antibiotic consumption should be carefully controlled and unjustified use of levofloxacin should be restricted, especially in some large cities. Antibiotic policy should be further strengthened and regular monitoring of resistance in various geographic regions is needed for treatment optimization.",

This study evaluated carbapenem resistance and clonal relatedness of A. baumannii isolated from burn patients and healthcare workers (HCWs).The study was performed in 100 non-duplicated A. baumannii isolates from nasal and hand samples of hospitalized burn patients and HCWs in two hospitals of Iran from June 2020 to August 2021. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed and carbapenemase genes were detected by PCR. Clonal relatedness of A. baumannii isolates was determined by two single-locus sequence-based typing of blaOXA-51-like and ampC and by multilocus sequence typing (MLST).All A. baumannii isolates were found to be MDR while susceptible to colistin. The intI1, conserved segments of class 1 integron (intI1 CS), blaIMP, blaVIM, blaOXA-51-like, and blaOXA-23-like, genes were detected in 32.5%, 29.1%, 36%, 95.3%, 100%, 100%; and 14.3%, 14.3%, 21.4%, 92.9%, 100%, and 85.7% of isolates from patients and from healthcare workers, respectively.

Most isolates were multidrug-resistant, with ESBL production primarily encoded by blaCTX-M-15 (n = 8) and blaCTX-M-1 (n = 4) followed by blaCTX-M-55 (n = 1) and blaTEM-26 (n = 1). One K. pneumoniae isolate co-harbored blaKPC and blaCTX-M-15 genes. Class 1 integrons were detected in 4 isolates, however, sul1, sul2, and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes were detected in eleven, two, and four isolates, respectively.

Prolonged exposure to bacteria could promote resistance to antimicrobial disinfectants. This study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of four commonly used disinfectants; triclosan, chlorhexidine digluconate, benzalkonium chloride, and formaldehyde against Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates. This study also determined the prevalence and association of efflux pumps encoding genes qacE, qacED1, emrA, and aceI with tolerance to disinfectants. A total of 100 A. baumannii isolates were included in the current study. The antimicrobial disinfectants' minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using an agar dilution method. Genes involved in resistance to disinfectants were investigated by PCR method. The benzalkonium chloride MICs ranged between 32 and 128 μg mL-1, chlorhexidine digluconate 8-64 μg mL-1, triclosan 1-32 μg mL-1, and formaldehyde 128 μg mL-1.

From January 2018 to February 2019, 866 Gram-negative bacilli were isolated, and among them 775 were identified as Enterobacterales . Out of the tested Enterobacterales , phenotypic testing revealed potential carbapenemase production in 95 isolates. A total of 56 clinically significant isolates were selected for molecular analysis. Species identification and antimicrobial susceptibility for conventional antibiotics was done using the VITEK 2 system, while carbapenemase genes were detected via Multiplex PCR. Antimicrobial susceptibility for newer antibiotics was determined by the MIC test strips. The predominant genotypes were bla NDM (39.3%) and bla OXA-48 (37.5%), with Klebsiella pneumoniae as the most prevalent producer (71.42%). Cefiderocol showed 100% effectiveness against all isolates. Ceftazidime-avibactam demonstrated high activity against OXA-48 and KPC producers (95.5% and 100% susceptibility, respectively). Meropenem-vaborbactam significantly improved susceptibility among NDM-. OXA-48/NDM-, and OXA-48-producing isolates, and imipenem-relebactam among OXA-48 CPE. Statistically significant differences in susceptibility were observed for OXA-48 and NDM producers to imipenem ( P &lt; 0.01), imipenem-relebactam ( P &lt; 0.001), and ceftazidime-avibactam ( P &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, the high prevalence of NDM-producing CPE strains significantly reduces the effectiveness of newer antibiotics. Cefiderocol appears to be the most effective therapeutic option, particularly for NDM producers, where it often represents the only viable treatment choice, while ceftazidime-avibactam is an effective option for OXA-48 producers. Statistically significant differences in susceptibility highlight the need for early detection of carbapenemases in clinical practice.",

This study aims to investigate the clonal relationships of A. baumannii isolates from diverse clinical samples, identify the sequence types of MDR isolates, and examine biofilm formation activity and biofilm-associated genes that contribute to persistence in hospital settings. A total of 90 A. baumannii isolates were analyzed. Bacterial identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing were conducted with MALDI-TOF MS and Vitek-2. REP-PCR was utilized to evaluate clonal connections, MLST was employed for specific isolates. Biofilm formation activity was assessed using the XTT reduction assay, and biofilm-associated genes were identified by PCR. REP-PCR revealed 29 genotypes, with Genotype A being identified as the endemic clone in 59% of isolates. Two isolates representing this genotype were found to belong to the ST2 clone. The majority of A. baumannii isolates possess biofilm-related genes and exhibit strong biofilm activity. In MDR isolates, ompA and csuE positivity were significantly higher than those non-MDR isolates ( P = 0.003, P = 0.001). The c suE positive isolates were found to have significantly stronger biofilm activity than negative ones ( P = 0.009). This study emphasizes the prevalence of a hospital-endemic, MDR A. baumannii genotype A, ST2 clone, and the genetic variability across isolates. No direct correlation was noted between MDR status and biofilm formation; however, some biofilm-related genes, notably csuE , were linked to stronger biofilm activity. These findings underscore the necessity for ongoing molecular surveillance and infection control measures to avert the dissemination of MDR A. baumannii in healthcare environments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is one of the major Gram-negative bacteria in human infections, which can cause pneumonia, sepsis, meningitis, and abscess. However, the current therapy for CRKP infection is polymyxin and tigecycline. The aim of this study is to analyze the in vitro antibacterial effects of cefoperazone/sulbactam (SCF) combined with ceftazidime (CAZ), imipenem/cilastatin (IMI), and meropenem (MEM) against CRKP harbouring different antibiotic resistance genes. In this study, fifteen clinical isolates of CRKP from January to December 2023 were taken from our hospital for bacterial identification and confirmation of carbapenemase genotypes, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of SCF, CAZ, IMI, and MEM were determined by broth microdilution method. The results of combined drug sensitivity test were determined by checkerboard method and characterized with fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC). The combined antibacterial activity was determined by time-kill curve. The results showed that among the 15 CRKP strains, 9 carried bla KPC gene, 3 carried bla NDM gene and 3 carried bla OXA-48-like gene. The MIC values determined by broth microdilution method showed better sensitivity of KPC-producing CRKP to four antimicrobial drugs including SCF. However, bla NDM as well as bla OXA-48-like genotypes showed strong resistance to all four antimicrobial drugs. The FIC values of SCF combined with CAZ, IMI and MEM showed that all tested antibacterial agents had the best effect on KPC-producing CRKP, and had no obvious additive effect on other CRKP. The results of time-kill curve showed that SCF combined with IMI had good antibacterial effect. This study found that SCF combined with IMI has a synergistic antibacterial effect on KPC producing carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae , which could provide reference for clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Abstract To identify antibiotic resistant genes and assess the clonality of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacter cloacae (CRECL) isolates from a hospital setting, altogether fifty-two clinical CRECL isolates were collected from 2012 to 2023. Antibiotic resistance genes including bla NDM , bla VIM , bla IMP , bla OXA-48 , bla CTX-M-1 and bla TEM , were analyzed by PCR and nucleic acid sequencing. Sequence data were compared with those in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database. Clonality analysis was performed by ERIC-PCR. Among the 52 isolates, urine samples (23.1%) were the most common source, followed by puncture fluid (13.5%). The isolates were predominately obtained from urology (15.4%), followed by hepatobiliary surgery (11.5%). All isolates exhibited carbapenem resistance, with resistance rates of 88.5%, 84.6%, and 94.2% to imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem, respectively. This was frequently accompanied by co-resistance to fluoroquinolones (67.2% to ciprofloxacin) and aminoglycosides (61.5% to tobramycin), likely due to the co-existence of multiple resistance genes on mobile genetic elements such as plasmids. However, all isolates remained sensitive to polymyxins, 67.2% to tigecycline and 50% to amikacin. Several carbapenem resistance genes were detected in isolates, with bla NDM-1 being the most abundant (40.4%), followed by bla NDM-5 (21.2%). Additionally, bla OXA-48 (3.8%), bla IMP-6 (1.9%) and bla VIM-1 gene (1.9%) have also been found in a few isolates. Among β-lactam resistance genes, bla TEM-1 (42.3%) is the most prevalent, followed by bla CTX-M-1 gene (23.1%). Clonality analysis classified the isolates into five clusters (A-E). Multiple strains exhibited &gt;86% similarity, indicating clonal spread. In conclusion, CRECL isolates demonstrated extensive antimicrobial resistance, primarily mediated by bla NDM-1 and bla TEM . Clonality analysis revealed the presence of clonally related strains across different hospital departments, suggesting potential nosocomial transmission. Enhanced surveillance, strict disinfection and isolation measures are necessary to prevent the spread of CRECL and mitigate nosocomial infections and dissemination of epidemics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Helicobacter pylori is a major pathogen infecting over half of the global population, causing conditions like gastritis, ulcers, gastric cancer, and lymphoid tissue lymphoma. This study investigated the prevalence of H. pylori in 100 gastric biopsy samples from patients with dyspepsia and analyzed antibiotic resistance and virulence genes (cagA, vacA, iceA, and babA) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Diagnosis was performed via PCR, culture, rapid urease test, and histopathological examination, with antibiotic susceptibility assessed through the E-test method. The study was conducted between September 2022 and February 2023. The study found that 34% of samples were PCR-positive for H. pylori , while culture, histology examination, and rapid urease test showed positivity rates of 23%, 53%, and 63%, respectively. Alarmingly, antibiotic resistance was prevalent, with 100% resistance to clarithromycin and metronidazole, 39.1% to tetracycline, and 34.8% to levofloxacin. Virulence gene analysis revealed high positivity rates: cagA (53%), babA (29%), iceA1 (20.6%), iceA2 (41.2%), and vacA (97.1%), with the vacA s1m2 allele variant being most common (55.8%). These findings underscore the significant role of virulence factors like cagA and vacA in H. pylori pathogenesis and the severity of related diseases. The study highlights the urgent need for routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing to guide treatment amidst escalating antibiotic resistance. It also emphasizes the value of molecular diagnostics, such as PCR, for accurate and rapid detection of H. pylori and its virulence determinants. These insights are critical for improving the management of H. pylori -associated diseases and combating antibiotic resistance globally.",

Strict infection control is critical to control its spread; however, it is challenging and requires a special approach. This study aims to investigate the colonization and infection of C. auris in intensive care units (ICUs), analyses its susceptibility, and mortality rates, and contributes to an effective infection control. An infection control study was planned, and a C. auris infection control bundle and checklist were developed. During the study's pre-intervention, intervention, and post-intervention periods, C. auris candidemia cases and colonized patients were identified. Until the infection control intervention, all the candidemia cases, antifungal resistance, and mortality were investigated retrospectively. Clinical isolates were identified by phenotypic and genotypic characterization using MALDI-TOF MS Biotyper (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) and sequencing. During the pre-intervention, intervention, and post-intervention periods, 26 C. auris cases were identified. Pan-resistant C. auris isolates were 3.84%, and the multidrug resistance was 65.38%. With the infection control intervention, the number of colonized patients decreased (pre-intervention 9.61‰, intervention 6.19‰, post-intervention 5.20‰). Candidemia incidence decreased from 4.09 to 2.3‰. No new cases of candidemia were observed at the end of the study. The risk of new cases is elevated in the rooms where multiple C. auris cases have been previously isolated. Mortality rate was high; namely, 76.92% of patients died, and 19.23% of strains were resistant to anidulofungin, one of the most commonly used antifungals. Despite the short implementation period, the infection control bundle and checklist have been demonstrated to be effective in controlling C. auris spread in the ICU.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Herein we present a case of a 12-year-old child with acute symptoms (abdominal pain, fever). Preliminary imaging suggested pyogenic liver abscess. Despite the broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, which was started after hospital admission, no improvement was perceived. Rising eosinophilia and multiplex focal lesions detected by ultrasound and MRI forced serological investigation by which Echinococcus granulosus s.l. seropositivity was detected. Antihelminthic therapy was initiated and upon multidisciplinary consultation surgical intervention was performed with the removal of a cystic lesion which ruptured to the peritoneal cavity. Histopathological and parasitological analysis finally verified alveolar echinococcosis (AE) caused by Echinococcus multilocularis. As the evacuation of one lesion cannot be regarded as curative intervention in this form of echinococcosis, albendazole was administered continuously until patient's medical condition improved and no progression was detected during imaging follow-up. In Hungary both cystic and alveolar echinococcosis are present therefore differential diagnosis of these two forms can be a clinical challenge. Slow rate of progression, long lasting asymptomatic period and relatively low incidence of AE disease can explain that cases during childhood are rarely identified. After reviewing all relevant literature in this topic, we present here the first pediatric AE case in Hungary.",

The results showed an average prevalence of 17.5% (28/160) ESBL-EC strains in poultry. All strains (28/28) were resistant to ampicillin and ceftriaxone. On the contrary, all strains were sensitive to amikacin, netilmicin, and nitrofurantoin. A total of 64.2% (18/28) of strains were MDR. The 32.1% (9/28) of the strains belonged to the B2 and D phylogroups, which are considered pathogenic groups, with 33.3% (3/9) MDR.

These VISA isolates were further characterized using biofilm formation, antimicrobial susceptibility tests, SCCmec typing, spa typing, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and PCR analysis for detecting resistance ( erm(B), tet(M), mecC, msr(B), mecA, mupA, vanA, aac(6′)-Ie/aph(2˝), mupB, msr(A), erm(C), erm(A), vanB, ant(4′)-Ia, and aph(3′)-IIIa ), biofilm ( clfA, clfB, fnbA, fnbB, ebp, cna and bap ) and virulence (eta , etb, pvl , and tst ) genes. Our results indicated that the 42 VISA isolates belonged to three clonal complexes, including CC8 (78.6%), CC22 (11.9%), and CC5 (9.5%).

A retrospective case-control study was conducted on 306 pediatric patients hospitalized with pertussis at Wuxue First People's Hospital between May 2023 and June 2024. Patients were stratified into three age groups: infants (2–12 months, n = 82), preschool children (1–6 years, n = 127), and school-aged children (7–13 years, n = 97). Age-matched healthy controls ( n = 306) were included for hematological comparisons. Data were analyzed using SPSS 22.0 and GraphPad Prism 9.5.0. Infants exhibited the most severe clinical profiles, with significantly elevated leukocyte and lymphocyte parameters compared to older groups ( P &lt; 0.001). The incidence of pneumonia was the highest in infants (82.93% vs. 33.07% in preschool and 22.68% in school-aged children, P &lt; 0.001). ROC analysis highlighted lymphocyte percentage as a reliable diagnostic marker in infants (AUC = 0.7620). Seasonal peaks occurred in spring (61.44%) and winter (20.91%). Notably, 84.32% of infected children were fully vaccinated, indicating waning immunity. Macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis strains were identified in 7.19% of cases however, co-trimoxazole was effective against these resistant strains. Severe pertussis occurred in 14.05% of cases, predominantly in infants (81.40%, P &lt; 0.001). Age is a critical factor in pertussis presentation. The high vaccination rate among cases underscores issues of waning immunity, necessitating updated immunization strategies. Emerging macrolide resistance warrants vigilance, with co-trimoxazole serving as an effective alternative for therapy. Infants require prioritized surveillance and prompt management.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is a prevalent iatrogenic complication of antibiotic therapy, primarily triggered by dysbiosis and loss of intestinal homeostasis. The traditional interventions, such as empirical probiotic use, have shown a modest and a heterogeneous efficacy. This review integrates the current mechanistic understanding of AAD through the lens of the microbiota–mucosal–immune axis and provides a comprehensive overview of emerging therapeutic strategies. By integrating evidence from metagenomics, metabolomics, and immunology, we highlight next-generation approaches, including rationally engineered probiotics, standardized fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and synthetic-biology-derived interventions. Recent progress in multi-omics technologies and machine learning has enabled patient-stratified modulation of the gut microbiota, moving beyond empirical supplementation toward precision ecological reprogramming. These advanced therapies demonstrate superior outcomes in restoring microbial diversity, strengthening epithelial barrier function, and re-establishing immunological homeostasis. Ultimately, the management of AAD requires a systems-biology strategy that leverages real-time microbiome analytics for targeted, accurate, and sustainable restoration of gut health.",

Of all these isolates a Streptomyces sp. that had the highest potential for xylanolytic activity was chosen. From various morphological, physiological and antagonistic properties, this isolate was found to belong to Streptomyces lividans. Factors affecting xylanase production by this organism in a basal salt medium containing purified sugar-cane bagasse xylan as a sole carbon source were examined. A noticeable increase in enzyme activity was observed in the presence of peptone or soyabean meal. However, a slight increase was noticed with ammonium sulphate. Optimum production for xylanase was achieved after five days incubation on a rotary shaker (180 rpm) at 30 degrees C. The initial pH values were around neutrality. In addition, this organism has high potential for xylanolytic activity when grown on lignocellulosic wastes including corn cobs, wheat bran, peanut shells, sawdust, wheat straw and sugar-cane-bagasse. Partial purification of the enzyme in the culture supernatant was achieved by salting out at 50-80% ammonium sulphate saturation with a purification of 9.03-fold and 57.9% recovery.",

    "abstract": "Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a family of clonal disorders characterized by dyshematopoiesis and susceptibility to acute myelogenous leukemia. Tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-alpha) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) are cytokines that play key roles in the pathogenesis of MDS. There have been several reports on the presence of genetic polymorphisms in the DNA sequence encoding the leader sequence of the TGF-beta protein, and in the -308 promoter region of TNF-alpha. The association between TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 gene polymorphism and the susceptibility to MDS and the progression of the disease was investigated. As compared with healthy control subjects (n = 74), patients with MDS (n = 55) showed no significant deviations in genotype or allele frequencies of TNF-alpha. Similarly, there were no differences in the distribution of TNF-alpha genotypes between the MDS patients with only anemia (mild group) and those with bi- or pancytopenia (severe group). On the other hand the TT homozygosity at codon 10 in exon 1 of TGF-beta1 gene was associated with a severe degree of cytopenia [95% CI OR = 4.889, p = 0.0071]. These findings suggest that the investigated genetic polymorphisms do not predispose to the development of MDS, but that TGF-beta1 gene polymorphism may affect the disease progression.",

This study was designed to evaluate the serum levels of interleukin-18 (IL-18), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and soluble Fas (sFas) in cases with pulmonary tuberculosis due to confirmed M. tuberculosis infection. The study comprised 50 patients with M. tuberculosis classified to 13 complicated cases and 37 uncomplicated patients. A significant (P<0.05) increase was found in the serum levels of IL-18, IFN-gamma and sFas in patients compared to controls and also in complicated cases compared to uncomplicated ones. Moreover, a positive significant correlation was found between serum levels of sFas with IL-18 (r=0.532, P<0.001), and with IFN-gamma (r=0.37, P=0.008) and lastly between serum levels of IL-18 with IFN-gamma (r=-0.612, P<0.001). It is concluded from these results with the recent observations that IFN-gamma levels are elevated after successful MTB treatment, suggest the possibility of enhanced Fas expression and then stimulating the infected macrophages to show an increased FasL-induced apoptosis. Modulation of FasL system by M. tuberculosis might represent an escape mechanism to evade the effect of apoptosis. Moreover, the elevated serum levels of IL-18, IFN-gamma and sFas can be considered as pathognomonic markers suggesting pulmonary tuberculosis especially in complicated cases.",

Microbial counts including Standard Plate Count (SPC), LAB, yeasts, coliforms, Salmonella , staphylococci and Clostridium were followed during two weeks of storage at 30 °C. Determinations of chemical parameters including pH, dry matter, fat, ash, total nitrogen (NT), total volatile basic nitrogen (TVBN) and trimethylamine (TMA) were carried out under the same conditions. Chemical determinations showed a net pH decrease from an initial value of 6.05 in raw sardine fillets to 4.3 after 16 days of fermentation. Increases in TMA content and TBVN were observed. Microbiological control showed that LAB counts reached a level up to 3.10 9 cfu/g after 4 days of fermentation. After two weeks, fermented fish was free of coliforms and Salmonella . The inhibition of pathogenic microflora including staphylococci and Clostridium was also observed. The results indicated that controlled LAB fermentation could be used as a successful process for biopreservation of sardines produced in huge quantities in Morocco.",

A total of 138 isoniazid (INH)-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis consisting of 108 MDR (multidrug resistant) and 30 XDR (extensively drug resistant) isolated from patients in different regions of Belarus from 2007 to 2008 were screened by a PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay and sequencing. As a result, 97.8% prevalence of the KatG315 mutation was detected in all isolates from patients either actually or previously treated with tuberculosis. This mutation was not found in any of 9 INH-susceptible isolates and 2 standard strains of H37Rv and Academia included in the study. All isolates that contained the mutation in KatG315 were classified as MDR and XDR by a culture-based susceptibility testing method. Among the 30 XDR isolates, 15 (50%), 12 (40%), and 3 (10%) were classified into principal genetic groups (PGG) 1, 2, and 3, respectively. It is concluded that INH-resistant MTB were associated with the mutated KatG315 phenotype. The simplicity of the assay, with 100% specificity, permits its implementation in routine practice at clinical microbiology laboratories for first and fast screening of cultures. This method has potential application for rapid diagnosis of INH resistance due to KatG315 mutation.",

One hundred ESBL-positive and one hundred ESBL-negative patients were included as cases and controls. Investigated risk factors were related to demographics, comorbid conditions, treatments, invasive procedures, surgery prior bacteremia, presence of additional nosocomial infections and preceding hospital admission within a year. Measured outcomes were crude mortality, mortality related to infection and delay in introducing appropriate therapy (DAT). Though some risk factors for infection (admission to intensive care units, having central venous and/or urinary catheter, mechanical ventilation) were shared by both groups, in other respects cases and controls were found to differ substantially. The 36 percent of patients with BSIs with ESBL-producing Klebsiella died versus 23 percent of controls (odds ratio [OR]: 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0-5.4; p = 0.02). The 18 percent of deaths in cases versus 9% in controls could be attributed to infection (OR: 5.0; 95% CI: 1.5-16.2; p = 0.006). Cases more often received previous antibiotic therapy than controls (OR: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.1-6.7; p = 0.02) and delay in the introduction of appropriate antibiotic treatment was observed in 44% of cases versus 19% of controls (OR: 3.4; 95% CI: 1.6-7.3; p = 0.001). The results demonstrate that BSIs caused by ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae are related to previous antibiotic therapy and are associated with a high rate of mortality that is often linked to delay in the introduction of appropriate antibiotic therapy. This confirms that besides infection control measures the early identification and antibiotic resistance profiling of the infecting pathogen is salient in the control of BSIs caused by ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae .",

NaOCl, iodine and Neomagnol were the most effective, whilst CHXand Solumium appeared to be less effective against these specific biofilms. The efficacy of the most effective agents differed according to biofilm and application time. All irrigants were efficient to some extent, but NaOCl proved to be the most efficient, while chlorine dioxide (ClO(2)) yielded the poorest results in these circumstances. The efficacy of NaOCl was already well-known, but our results also point out that iodine could have an important role in endodontic irrigation.",

It is recommended to enhance enterovirus surveillance in the region of European countries, since the exchange of the oral poliovirus vaccine to the enhanced inactivated polio vaccine might result in enhanced circulation of non-polio enteroviruses leading to the increase in the number of type I (juvenile) diabetes patients.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage rate in healthy children all over Hungary and to specify some risk factors, the antibiotic resistance patterns of the bacteria, and their genetic relatedness. In total, 878 children (aged 3-6 years) were screened at 21 day-care centers in 16 different cities in Hungary, between February 2009 and December 2011. Samples taken from both nostrils were cultured on blood agar, and suspected S. aureus isolates were identified by β-hemolysis, catalase positivity, clump test, and nucA PCR. Methicillin-resistant strains were screened by mecA and mecC PCR. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by agar dilution or gradient test strips. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used for genotyping. S. aureus carriage rate was found to be 21.3%, which correlates well with international data. We found no statistically significant correlation between the gender or the sibling status and S. aureus carriage. All isolates were sensitive to oxacillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and mupirocin. The resistance rates for erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, gentamicin, and tetracycline were 7.5%, 0.5%, 1.1%, 3.7%, and 4.3%, respectively. The isolates showed very high genetic diversity. In summary, carried S. aureus isolates are more sensitive to antibiotics compared with clinical isolates in Hungary, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus carriage rate is very low yet.",

The MALDI-TOF/MS analysis of OMPs in the colistin-susceptible K. pneumoniae found 16 kDa proteins belonging to the LysM domain/BON superfamily, as well as DNA starvation proteins, whereas OmpX and OmpW were detected in the colistin-resistant counterpart strains. OmpC and OmpW were detected in the colistin-susceptible E. asburiae , whereas OmpA and OmpX were identified in the colistin-resistant counterpart. This study demonstrated that OMP differences were between colistin-susceptible and -resistant counterpart strains.

The samples originated from the first case, an aborted cattle fetus without malformation collected in 2012, and from the blood samples of six adult cattle in 2014. The Hungarian SBV sequences shared ≥99.3% nucleotide (nt) and ≥97.8% amino acid (aa) identity with each other, and ≥98.9 nt and ≥96.7% aa identity with reference strains. Although phylogenetic analyses showed low resolution in general, the M sequences of cattle and sheep origin SBV strains seemed to cluster on different branches.

The autoimmune reaction, which ultimately leads to the destruction of pancreatic beta cells, causing insulin deficiency and T1D, is a result of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors. Precisely, what are these environmental factors? Current popular opinion implies these pathogens, such as viruses, especially human enteroviruses, are a triggering factor. On the other hand, the hygiene hypotheses states in which the increase of autoimmune diseases, such as T1D, can, in fact, be explained by the decrease of infections, and infectious agents, more like viruses, actually serve as a defense mechanism, therefore, protect us from developing certain autoimmune diseases. Additionally, the relationship between the gut microbiota and autoimmune diseases is currently gaining increased interest including relative research now demonstrating how the guts immune system plays a crucial role in the development of autoimmune diseases. This literature review aims to evaluate these three popular suspects: Viral infections, hygiene and gut microbiota, in relation to their potential triggering effect on T1D and their close relationship to one another.",

In this research, LPAIV H9N2 strain, A/Chicken/IRN/Ghazvin/2001, was multiplied on SPF eggs and irradiated by a Nordian gamma cell instrument. Irradiated and non-irradiated AI virus (AIV) samples were titrated by EID50 method and hemagglutinin (HA) antigen was analyzed by HA test as the WHO pattern method. Infectivity of irradiated virus was determined by egg inoculation method during four blind cultures. The results showed that after increasing the dose of gamma radiation, virus titer gradually decreased. D10 value and optimum dose for complete virus inactivation were calculated by dose/response curve, 3.36 and 29.52 kGy, respectively. In addition, HA antigenicity of gamma-irradiated virus samples from 0 to 30 kGy was not changed. The results of safety test for gamma-irradiated AIV samples showed complete inactivation with gamma ray doses 30 and 35 kGy, without any multiplication on eggs after four blind cultures. According to the results of HA antigen assay and safety test, the gamma-irradiated and complete inactivated AIV subtype H9N2 is a good candidate as an inactivated immunogenic agent for poultry vaccination.",

Penicillin reduced adherence and biofilm production in TPh strains, whereas ceftriaxone diminished adherence and biofilm formation in CA group. On the contrary, clindamycin enhanced adherence and biofilm production in both groups of strains. Erythromycin did not significantly alter adherence, but triggered biofilm production in both groups of isolates. Hydrophobicity of both groups of strains was significantly reduced after exposure to all antibiotics. Beta-lactams displayed anti-biofilm activity; penicillin diminished both adherence and biofilm production in TPh strains, whereas ceftriaxone reduced it in strains isolated from CA.",

The proportion of severe cases is significantly elevating and clinicians now have to contend with the problem of additional and more frequent episodes of recurrences including an upward trend in the mortality rate. This situation led us to investigate the possibility of the fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). An amount of 100 ml of fecal microbiota solution was instilled into a nasojejunal (NJ) tube in 16 cases and into a nasogastric (NG) tube in 44 cases. In all of the cases, where the solution was instilled via nasojejunal tubes, the symptoms resolved within 24 h. We did not note any recurrences in this group. When the material was flushed in through nasogastric tubes, the symptoms resolved in 39 (88.64%) cases within 24 h. In this group, we have experienced a recurrent episode of C. difficile infection in five (11.36%) cases. Three of them were cured with a second transplantation. We have found that in our practice the upper gastrointestinal tract methods had the primary cure rate of 91.67%, whereas the secondary cure rate is 96.67%. When we compared the NJ and NG methods, we have found that the differences in the outcomes are not significant statistically (p = 0.3113 using Fisher's exact probability test). In conclusion, FMT proved to be very effective, particularly in recurrent infections and in cases where conventional treatment had failed.",

The major reasons for nosocomial spread of these species are their abilities to develop and transfer drug resistance against various classes of antibiotics. Considering that Acinetobacter spp. are ubiquitous in nature, can utilize several carbon sources, and reach humans via various pathways, our aim was to obtain information about the environmental strains of this genus. Our first step was to develop and test a multistep isolation procedure based on traditional scientific methods. Antibiotic resistance patterns of the isolated strains were determined, as susceptibility to 12 antibiotics of 7 classes was tested by MIC Test Strip method. Altogether 366 samples (groundwater, surface water, and soil) of 24 sites were investigated and a collection of 37 Acinetobacter isolates was obtained. Among others, clinically important human pathogen Acinetobacter spp., such as A. baumannii, A. johnsonii, and A. gyllenbergii were identified. Three environmental strains were determined as multidrug-resistant including a carbapenem-resistant, hemolytic Acinetobacter beijerinckii strain isolated from a hydrocarbon-contaminated groundwater sample. In summary, it has been found that the applied multistep isolation procedure is applicable to isolate various species of Acinetobacter genus. Based on the antibiotic resistance assay, we can conclude that environmental representatives of Acinetobacter spp. are able to develop multidrug resistance, but at a lower rate than their clinical counterparts.",

During the time period 2016–2017, altogether 75 respiratory samples from children hospitalized with acute respiratory infection were collected. The samples were first screened for RSV by direct immunofluorescence method and then subjected to detect HBoV DNA by PCR. Genotyping of HBoV-positive samples was conducted by direct sequencing of PCR products using NP and VP1/VP2 genes. Out of 75 respiratory samples, 20 (26.7%) and 10 (13.3%) were positive for RSV and HBoV, respectively. The coinfection rate was 40% ( p = 0.048). Considering the seasonal distribution, winter has the highest extent outbreak ( p = 0.036). Sequence analysis of positive samples exhibits that all of the isolated HBoV were related to genotype 1 (HBoV-1) with minimal sequence variations. Increasing frequency of HBoV suggests that the virus is related to acute respiratory infection in children. A single genetic lineage of HBoV1 seems to be the major genotype in Iran.",

In respect to high GC content of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, nonsynonymous mutations are dominant in this group. In this study a collection of 145 M. tuberculosis isolates was used to evaluate the conferring mutations in nucleotide 1388 of katG gene (KatG463) in resistance to isoniazid. A PCR-RFLP method was applied in comparison with DNA sequencing and anti-mycobacterial susceptibility testing. From all studied patients, 98 (67.6%) were men, 47 (32.4%) were women, 3% were <15 and 9% were >65 years old; male to female ratio was 1:2.4. PCR result of katG for a 620-bp amplicon was successful for all purified M. tuberculosis isolates and there was no positive M. tuberculosis culture with PCR negative results (100% specificity). Subsequent PCR RFLP of the katG identified mutation at KatG463 in 33.3%, 57.8% and 59.2% of our clinically susceptible, multidrug resistant TB (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) isolates, respectively. Strains of H37Rv and Academic had no any mutations in this codon. M. bovis was used as a positive control for mutation in KatG463. Automated DNA sequencing of the katG amplicon from randomly selected INH-susceptible and resistant isolates verified 100% sequence accuracy of the point mutations detected by PCR-RFLP. We concluded that codon 463 was a polymorphic site that is associated to INH resistance (a missense or \"quiet\" mutation). RFLP results of katG amplicons were identical to those of sequence method. Our PCR-RFLP method has a potential application for rapid diagnosis of M. tuberculosis with a high specificity.",

The 3912 cardio-thoracic surgery patients from all age groups were admitted to the study at the Gottsegen György Hungarian Institute of Cardiology between January 1999 and December 2000. In each patient with BSI demographic, epidemiological and clinical variables were recorded along with potential risk factors. Incidence of associated pathogens and their possible sources were evaluated and outcome and mortality risk factors were assessed. There were a total of 134 episodes of BSI. The incidence was 34.25 per 1000 admissions. The leading microorganisms were staphylococci (37.7%). Bacteremic episodes developed secondary to an identifiable source in 27.6% of the cases, or were catheter-related (16.4%). In 56% of the cases the source was not identified.

Outbreaks were detected in European countries and caused economic losses for goose keepers. Domestic ducks may be infected with GHPV without any signs typical for geese. The genomic organisation of some isolates was described but the gene functions and the pathomechanisms of the virus was not precisely defined. Here we describe the genome sequence and structure of GHPV of a goose from a Hungarian goose flock showing characteristics of the haemorrhagic nephritis and enteritis. The GHPV genome investigated in this study was 5252 bp long and was very similar (99% nucleotide identity) to sequences deposited in the GenBank. All the whole GHPV genomes possess the same ORFs in length, including the VP1, VP2, VP3, ORF-X, t and T tumour antigens. Amino acid changes are detected mainly in the putative ORF-X region. Data about the GHPV genome imply a conserved genomic structure among isolates from different countries. Genomic and epidemiological studies may help vaccine development efforts and identify potential heterologous reservoirs of GHPV.",

The examined thermal wells located nearby Szarvas are used for heating industrial and agricultural facilities because of their relatively high hydrocarbon content. The aim of this study was to reveal the prokaryotic community structure of the water of SZR18, K87 and SZR21 geothermal wells using molecular cloning methods and Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE). Water samples from the outflow pipes were collected in 2012 and 2013. The phylogenetic distribution of archaeal molecular clones was very similar in each sample, the most abundant groups belonged to the genera Methanosaeta, Methanothermobacter and Thermofilum . In contrast, the distribution of bacterial molecular clones was very diverse. Many of them showed the closest sequence similarities to uncultured clone sequences from similar thermal environments. From the water of the SZR18 well, phylotypes closely related to genera Fictibacillus and Alicyclobacillus (Firmicutes) were only revealed, while the bacterial diversity of the K87 well water was much higher. Here, the members of the phyla Thermodesulfobacteria, Proteobacteria, Nitrospira, Chlorobi, OP1 and OPB7 were also detected besides Firmicutes.",

An investigation was performed to characterize the genetic background of the pathogens to ascertain if the recurrent invasive meningococcal disease was caused by the same strain and to find out the reason for reinfection. Both meningococci belonged to the fine type Y:P1.5-2,10-1:F4-1:ST-23. This is the first description of the Europe-wide prevalent N. meningitidis serogroup Y in Hungary. In the first episode, we found wild-type rpoB allele in the non-culturable sample implying the susceptibility to rifampicin. The culturable isolate from the second episode proved resistant to rifampicin and had a point mutation in the rpoB gene. The rifampicin resistance might have evolved during the prophylactic treatment of contacts. Previous immunization of the patient with polysaccharide vaccine was ineffective due to his immunodeficiency, thus immunization with conjugate vaccine was proposed. We have proposed the implementation of centralized rifampicin susceptibility testing of N. meningitidis strains within a defined time frame to intervene and administer appropriate prophylaxis to close contacts.",

    "abstract": "Biofilm structures are the most resistant form of active microorganisms against sanitation, disinfection, and sterilization processes. One of the specific properties of biofilm is the development of antibiotic resistance that can be up to 1,000-fold greater than planktonic cells. Enterococcus faecium is a human pathogen that causes nosocomial bacteremia and at the present time, it is well known that most of the chronic infections are biofilm-based. Recent evidence suggested that subinhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) of antibiotics have an important role in the evolution of antibiotic resistance and induction on biofilm formation. Based on this information, we aimed to determine the effect of subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations on biofilm formation and the role of the antibiotic concentrations on the enterococcal surface protein gene ( esp ). To determine the impact of clinically important antibiotics on biofilm production, crystal violet assay was used. Then, the effect of sub-MICs of antibiotics on the expression of the esp gene was investigated by quantitative real-time PCR. Biofilm production assays show that MIC/2 of erythromycin (ERT; 512 μg/ml), MIC/32 of vancomycin (VAN; 16 μg/ml), MIC/64 of streptomycin (STR; 32 μg/ml), and MIC/128 of kanamycin (KAN; 4 μg/ml) values induce maximum biofilm production compared with the control. According to q-PCR results, sub-MIC values of ERT, VAN, and STR antibiotics were found to enhance esp gene expression. In addition, despite the increasing biofilm production after KAN treatment, the antibiotic was not effective on the esp expression.",

Overall, 62 BSIs were diagnosed in 406 patients, of which 13 were catheter-related BSI (3.0/1,000 CVC-days) and 30 BSIs of unknown origin, while 15% were attributed to ED CVC exposure. Lactate ≥2 mmol/L and SOFA score were independent ED-related predictors of BSI, while CVC in place for &gt;7 days and mechanical ventilation &gt;7 days were significant ICU-related predictors. The most common bacteria recovered were Acinetobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates were methicillin-resistant, whereas 66% of Enterococcus spp. were vancomycin-resistant. All isolates of Enterobacteriaceae were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, whereas 87.5% of P. aeruginosa and 95.8% of Acinetobacter spp. isolates were resistant to carbapenems. ED BSI contributes substantially to overall ICU incidence of BSI. Lactate level and SOFA score can help to identify patients with higher risk of developing BSI. Better overall and CVC-specific control measures in patients with trauma are needed.",

The soil physical and chemical properties were quite different at the three sampling sites. Multivariate statistics (PCA and UPGMA) revealed that Zab-szék samples could be separated according to their genetic profile from the two others which might be attributed to the geographical location and perhaps the differences in soil physical properties. Böddi-szék samples could be separated from the two others considering the metabolic activity which could be explained by their high salt and low humus contents. The number of bands in DGGE gels was related to the metabolic activity, and positively correlated with soil humus content, but negatively with soil salt content. The main finding was that geographical location, soil physical and chemical properties and the type of vegetation were all important factors influencing the metabolic activity and genetic diversity of rhizosphere microbial communities.",

This study aimed to compare phenotypic and molecular methods for detection and characterization of CRE isolates at a large tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia. This study was carried out between January 2011 and November 2013 at the King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH) in Saudi Arabia. Determination of presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) and carbapenem resistance was in accordance with Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Phenotypic classification was done by the MASTDISCS TM ID inhibitor combination disk method. Genotypic characterization of ESBL and carbapenemase genes was performed by the Check-MDR CT102. Diversilab rep-PCR was used for the determination of clonal relationship. Of the 883 ESBL-positive Enterobacteriaceae detected during the study period, 14 (1.6%) isolates were carbapenem resistant. Both the molecular genotypic characterization and phenotypic testing were in agreement in the detection of all 8 metalo-beta-lactamases (MBL) producing isolates. Of these 8 MBL-producers, 5 were positive for bla NDM gene and 3 were positive for bla VIM gene. Molecular method identified additional bla OXA gene isolates while MASTDISCS TM ID detected one AmpC producer isolate. Both methods agreed in identifying 2 carbapenem resistant isolates which were negative for carbapenemase genes. Diversilab rep-PCR analysis of the 9 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates revealed polyclonal distribution into eight clusters. MASTDISCS TM ID is a reliable simple cheap phenotypic method for detection of majority of carbapenemase genes with the exception of the bla OXA gene.

The review lists the observations on the relationship between lectins and Tetrahymena and try to construe them on the basis of the data, which are at our disposal. Considering the data, lectins can be used by Tetrahymena as materials for influencing conjugation, for stimulating hormone receptors, and by this, mimic the hormonal functions. Lectins can influence phagocytosis and movement of the cells as well as the cell division. As Tetrahymena can recognize both related and hostile cells by the help of lectins and surface sugars, it could be surmised a complex predator–prey system. This could determine the survival of the population as well as the nourishment conditions. When Tetrahymena is pathogenic, it can use lectins as virulence factors.",

The present study aimed to explore the CFDC resistance mechanisms of an extensively drug-resistant A. baumannii isolate from Bulgaria. The A. baumannii Aba52 strain (designated Aba52) was obtained in 2018 from a blood sample of a critically ill patient. The methodology included antimicrobial susceptibility testing, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), multilocus sequence typing, and phylogenomic analysis. The isolate demonstrated high-level resistance to CFDC (MIC = 64 mg L −1 ), resistance to carbapenems, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and tigecycline, as well as susceptibility only to colistin. WGS-based resistome analysis revealed the existence of bla OXA-23 , bla OXA-66 and bla ADC-73 . Seven non-conservative missense mutations affecting iron transport-related genes were detected: exbD4 (p.Ser61Pro), tonB2 (p.Ala268Val), bauA (p.Thr61Ala), ftsI (p.Ala515Val), piuA (p.Gly216Val), and feoB (p.Ser429Pro and p.Thr595Ala). A variety of virulence factors associated with adherence, biofilm formation, enzyme production, immune invasion, iron uptake, quorum sensing, and two-component regulatory systems were identified, suggesting a significant pathogenic potential of Aba52. The performed RT-qPCR analysis showed diminished (0.17) and absent expression of the pirA and piuA genes, respectively, encoding TonB-dependent siderophore receptors. Aba52 belonged to the widespread high-risk sequence type ST2 (Pasteur scheme). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented case of CFDC-resistant A. baumannii in Bulgaria even though, CFDC has never been applied in our country. The emerging resistance highlights the crucial need for nationwide surveillance targeting the implementation of novel antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae is an emerging pathogen that has gained attention due to its increased ability to cause infections even in healthy individuals. The aim of this study is to investigate virulence factors in K. pneumoniae strains isolated from clinical specimens and their association with carbapenem resistance. The study was conducted on 260 isolates identified between 2018 and 2023 at the Mohammed V Military Teaching Hospital in Rabat, Morocco. The isolates were categorized based on their susceptibility to antibiotics. The hypermucoviscosity was determined by a string test, while the presence of capsular serotypes and virulence genes were identified by PCR. Among our strains, 6.2% (n = 16) exhibited hypervirulent characteristics, 56% were resistant to carbapenem. Notably, 5.7% (n = 6) of carbapenem-resistant isolates expressed the hypermucoviscous phenotype, while 1.5% (n = 2) of carbapenem-susceptible K. pneumoniae isolates exhibited the same trait. In our study, we found that a total of 10 isolates (3.8%) had virulent capsular serotypes, with K2 being the most prevalent 40% (n = 4) and K20 in 30% (n = 3). Furthermore, we detected the presence of the Aerobactin gene in 1.5% (n = 4) of the isolates examined. Based on our findings, it appears that there was no correlation between the presence of virulence factors and carbapenem resistance. In conclusion, identifying hypervirulent K. pneumoniae in clinical specimens and assessing their antibiotic resistance profiles are crucial to ensure effective therapy and to prevent outbreaks.",

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (AHSCT) recipients are highly exposed to these type of bacteria. The aim of our study was to investigate prevalence of CRE colonization in AHSCT patients and to determine genes encoding carbapenem resistance. A retrospective study conducted between January 2015 and December 2019, involved 55 patients colonized with CRE strains. We determined the rate of antibiotic resistance according to European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) and the carbapenem resistance genes by PCR assays for genes encoding most frequent β-lactamases namely, blaGES, blaKPC, blaIMI, blaNDM, blaVIM, blaIMP and blaOXA-48. Eighty-one episodes of CRE colonization were recorded in 55 patients, mainly suffering from acute leukaemia (30%) and aplastic anemia (26%). History of hospitalization was noted in 80 episodes. Prior antibiotic treatment, severe neutropenia and corticosteroid therapy were respectively found in 94%, 76% and 58% of cases. Among the 55 patients, six patients (11%) developed a CRE infection. The CRE responsible for colonization were carbapenemase producers in 90% of cases. They belonged mostly to Klebsiella pneumoniae (61/81) and Escherichia coli species (10/81). Antibiotic resistance rates were 100% for ertapenem, 53% for imipenem, 42% for amikacin, 88% for ciprofloxacin and 27% for fosfomycin. Molecular study showed that blaOXA-48 gene was the most frequent (60.5%), followed by blaNDM (58%). Thirty-five (43%) strains were co-producers of carbapenemases. In our study, we report a high rate of CRE intestinal colonization in AHSCT recipients of our center.",

JN.1 exhibits a unique mutation (L455S) in the spike protein compared to the BA.2.86 lineage, which may affect its transmissibility and immune evasion capabilities. JN.1 has been designated as a \"variant of interest\" by the World Health Organization due to its rapidly increasing spread and is being closely monitored for its impact on the COVID-19 pandemic. This study describes the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 JN.1 sub-variant in Tunisia, and reports its mutation profiles.Nasopharyngeal samples collected over a four-month period (October 2023 to January 2024) were subjected to RNA extraction and real-time RT-PCR confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The whole-genome sequencing was performed by an iSeq 100 sequencer and COVIDSeq kit reagents (Illumina, USA).Mutation analysis, using the NextClade platform and GISAID database, revealed the presence of JN.1 in 15 out of 80 positive cases (18.75%) during the study period.The emergence of JN.1 highlights the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the need for continued surveillance and research to better understand the characteristics and impact of emerging variants.",

Our aim was to study the differences in vaginal microbiota between infertile women with repeated implantation failure (RIF) and those who achieved clinical pregnancy in their first frozen embryo transfer cycle. We compared the vaginal microbiota of patients with a history of RIF ( n = 37) with that of the control group ( n = 43). Following DNA extraction, metagenomic sequencing was employed for the analysis of alpha and beta diversities, distinctions in bacterial species, and the functional annotation of microbial genes. Furthermore, disparities between the two groups were revealed. Alpha diversity analysis revealed that the Shannon index was higher in the RIF group ( P &lt; 0.05). There were differences in the beta diversity between groups ( P = 0.16). At the bacterial family level, the relative abundance of Actinomycetaceae ( P = 0.013) and Ruminococcaceae ( P = 0.013) were significantly higher in the RIF group. At the genus level, the abundances of Actinomyces ( P = 0.028) and Subdoligranulum ( P = 0.013) were significantly higher in the RIF group. At the species level, the abundances of Prevotella timonensis ( P = 0.028), Lactobacillus jensenii ( P = 0.049), and Subdoligranulum ( P = 0.013) were significantly higher in the RIF group. Significant differences in family, genus, species, alpha and beta diversity were observed in the vaginal microbiota between groups. Notably, among these findings, the Subdoligranulum genus emerged as the most prominent correlating factor.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated a strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae, identified as GRTHES, which exhibited extensive antibiotic resistance. The strain was resistant to all beta-lactams, including combinations with newer agents such as meropenem/vaborbactam and imipenem/relebactam, as well as to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, fosfomycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and colistin. It remained susceptible to tigecycline. Whole-genome sequencing was performed by Ion Torrent platform on the K. pneumoniae strain. Genomic analysis revealed a genome length of 5,808,650 bp and a GC content of 56.9%. Advanced sequencing techniques and bioinformatic tools were used to assess resistance genes and plasmid replicons, highlighting the emergence of multidrug resistance and virulence traits. The strain carried blaNDM-1 and blaKPC-3 genes and was designated to KL107 O2afg type. Colistin resistance-associated mgrB/pmrB gene mutations were present, and the strain also harbored yersiniabactin-encoding ybt gene. Our findings provide insights into the genomic context of blaNDM-1 and blaKPC-3 carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae and emphasize the importance of continuous surveillance and novel therapeutic strategies to combat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. It is the first time that an NDM-1 and KPC-3 co-producing strain of K. pneumoniae ST512 is identified in Greece. This study highlights the essential role of genomic surveillance as a proactive strategy to control the spread of carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae isolates, particularly when key antimicrobial resistance genes, such as blaNDM-1 and blaKPC-3, are plasmid-mediated. Detailed characterization of these isolates could reveal plasmid similarities that facilitate adaptation and transmission within and between hospitals. Although data on patient movements are limited, it is plausible that carbapenem-resistant isolate was selected to co-produce KPC and NDM through plasmid acquisition.",

The side-specificity of genital HPVs led to the assumption that HPVs were primarily transmitted by sexual contact. However, since HPVs have been detected in virgins, infants/children and juvenile laryngeal papillomatosis was shown to be caused by these viruses, it became acknowledged that HPVs may be transmitted by other – non-sexual – routes as well.

The molecular mechanisms involved in the blockade of the MIE gene expression in undifferentiated NTera2 cells include covalent closure of the circular conformation of the viral genome, silencing of the viral MIE promoter by histone deacetylation, and increases in the expression of negatively regulating transcription factors responsible for the recruitment of the histone deacytylases around the viral MIE promoter (MIEP), resulting in repression of the MIEP in undifferentiated cells. The treatment of NTera2 cells with retinoic acid induces the differentiation of these cells. In HCMV-infected differentiated NTera2 cells, the MIEP becomes associated with hyperacetylated histones, which results in an open structure of chromatin, enhancing the access of DNA- binding factors which positively regulate MIE gene expression and viral replication. This model system contributes to an understanding of HCMV latency and reactivation in vivo in the cells of the myeloid lineage.",

To investigate the influence of TLR activation Pam3Cys and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) emulsified in FIA were tested in combinations with MCS-18.

    "abstract": "Recently, a PCR-derived method for serotyping Streptococcus pneumoniae has been devised to substitute the conventional antiserum phenotypic method. The method initially used a multiplex PCR reaction, dividing the isolates into 6 different groups based on the detected PCR gel pattern. In order to optimise and refine this crucial step, the Taguchi technique was employed, which can evaluate the individual effect of six parameters (in this case: primers, MgCl2, nucleotide mix, polymerase and buffer), with only 18 experiments; varying the parameter levels in an orthogonal matrix which suppresses the interactions between them. With this method, clear and sharp bands were observed in 5 experiments out of the 18, while the PCR did not work reliably in the remaining cases. In addition, the PCR-based technique could be rendered more economic by the 10-fold lowering of the quantities of two primers. The modified reaction yielded identical results to those obtained with the original method. Furthermore, we have designed serotype-specific primers for 11 new serotypes. The most important ones are those that can distinguish the very closely related, but equally important serotypes 6A and 6B.",

    "abstract": "Microorganisms such as Chlamydia pneumoniae have been shown to infect vascular cells and are believed to contribute to vascular inflammation and atherosclerotic plaque development. Plasma levels of oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) have received considerable attention as potential predictors of prognosis in atherosclerotic diseases. Lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor-1 (LOX-1) is one of the major receptors for oxidized LDL. It was investigated whether C. pneumoniae infection can stimulate expression of LOX-1 in vascular smooth muscle cells. Expression of LOX-1 in VSMC was measured by RT-PCR and immunoblotting following C. pneumoniae infection. To examine the pharmacological effect of a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor on LOX-1 expression, cells were co-incubated with fluvastatin immediately after infection. Adose and time dependent expression of LOX-1mRNAand protein was found in C. pneumoniae infected SMC. After heat and UV light treatment of the chlamydial inoculum the level of LOX-1 was reduced to that of mock-infected cultures. Furthermore, treatment of infected cells with fluvastatin decreased LOX-1 expression to baseline levels. The up-regulation of LOX-1 induced by C. pneumoniae could lead to continued lipid accumulation in atherosclerotic lesions. Together with the widespread expression of LOX-1, this might contribute to the epidemiologic link between C. pneumoniae infection and atherosclerosis. The effect of lowering the LOX-1 expression by fluvastatin may provide a pharmacological option of limiting oxLDL uptake via its scavenger receptor.",

The polymerase chain reaction-restriction enzyme analysis (PRA) method and DNA sequence analysis method were utilized to target a gene region that codes the 65-kDa heat-shock protein for typing 150 suspected NTM samples isolated from the respiratory tract. Mycobacterium abscessus, Mycobacterium xenopi, Mycobacterium fortuitum , and Mycobacterium peregrinum were most frequently found by both methods. Six isolates that could not be defined by the PRA method were defined as Nocardia cyriacigeorgica, Nocardia abscessus , and Mycobacterium intracellulare by DNA sequence analysis. Discordance between the results of the two methods was observed for only one isolate. The isolate that was defined as Mycobacterium gordonae type 6 by the PRA method was defined as Mycobacterium senegalense by sequence analysis. The PRA method is simple and gives rapid results. Compared with DNA sequence analysis, it gives consistent and reliable results up to a ratio of 90%. DNA sequence analysis is the gold standard method in which all strains can be defined. However, given our laboratory conditions, its disadvantage is that it takes longer to reach a diagnosis than through the PRA method.",

This study was conducted to analyze the association between some factors that may favor the dissemination of A. baumannii clinical isolates. A total of 47 clinical strains of A. baumannii were evaluated to carbapenem, the ability to produce biofilm, the susceptibility to some antiseptics, and the survival time on cotton fabrics. Most of the isolates were resistant to carbapenem (72.3%), produced biofilm (83%), and survived more than 7 (51%) days on fabrics. A significant association between decreased susceptibility to antiseptics containing chlorhexidine or triclosan and carbapenem resistance and survival on fabrics could be observed. The resistance to carbapenem was significantly associated with survival on fabric, but not with the ability to form biofilm. The survival of the isolates on fabric was not associated with the ability to produce biofilms. Characteristics, such as resistance to antibiotics, ability to form biofilm, and survival on dry surfaces, probably contribute to the proliferation of this organism when selected in the hospital environment and can partly explain its success as responsible for nosocomial infection.",

The sensitivity of LAMP was 100% among 39 M. pneumoniae isolates and the specificity was 100% among 9 members of other Mycoplasma and 12 common respiratory pathogens. The lowest detectable limit (LDL) of this assay was 102 copies, which detected by a series of standard M. pneumoniae DNA. To evaluate the clinical applicability of the LAMP assay, a total of 80 clinical samples were examined by conventional PCR, real-time PCR and the LAMP assays, respectively. The positive rates were 15.0%, 32.5% and 26.3%, respectively. This colorimetric LAMP assay demonstrated a high level of sensitivity comparable with that of conventional PCR for the detection of M. pneumoniae.

The intestinal tract, it is primarily colonized by various strains of commensal E. coli but it may include ExPEC as well. Here we aimed to assess possible genetic and evolutionary linkages between extraintestinal pathogenic and intestinal (commensal) E. coli of poultry. For that purpose we analysed 71 ExPEC isolates, and 40 intestinal isolates assumed to be commensal E. coli (IntEC), from dead chickens and turkey poults for 26 virulence related genes. Although the two groups shared several virulence determinants the genes pic, papC , and cdtIV were exclusively present in ExPEC and further five genes ( colV, iss, kpsM, tsh and iutA ), were significantly more frequent among ExPEC. Phylogenetic backgrounds of ExPEC and of IntEC isolates indicated significant differences. A 40% of ExPEC belonged to phylogroup A primarily containing strains of serogroup O78. Phylogroup D contained ExPEC strains of serogroups O53 (2 strains) and O115 (5 strains) characterized by the cdt -IV genes, suggesting the existence of new clones of avian ExPEC in phylogenetic group D. On the other hand, a 42.5% of IntEC belonged to phylogroup B1 with diverse serogroups. Our data provide insight into the clonal evolution of avian ExPEC especially in phylogenetic groups A and D, resulting avian ExPEC with similarities to human ExPEC.",

In salt solution TSH as well as HCG decreased the level of serotonin. The results show that at this low level of phylogeny TSH effect is not completely thyroxine-specific, however it is not general. HCG overlaps TSH effect on epinephrine and serotonin production, however its effect is broader. The experiments also demonstrate that the effect of pituitary trop-hormones can be bidirectional in Tetrahymena, as histamine level was increased and epinephrine level was decreased by HCG, in the same cells.",

To type these isolates, amplification of fragments of coa and spa genes was done and restriction enzyme digestion pattern was determined by PCR-RFLP method. Among the 250 samples, 50 isolates belonged to S. aureus and results of antibiotic sensitivity showed that 68% (34 samples) of isolates were methicillin resistant. Frequency of mec A and pvl genes among S. aureus isolates were 60% (30 samples) and 20% (10 samples). The PCR of coa gene showed three patterns whereas that of spa gene showed two patterns for enzyme digestion. Result of PCR-RFLP using Hae III enzymes for coa gene and Bsp 1431 for spa gene showed three patterns for enzyme digestion.

    "abstract": "Demodex folliculorum shows a high occurrence in the general population, however, its pathologic relevance is still controversial. In this prospective study, we evaluated the prevalence of D. folliculorum on eyelashes from 8,033 subjects of a university population (including 7,782 students, and 251 academics). Additional information on some risk factors to infection by the mites was evaluated, as well. A prevalence of 1.47% was found, where 118 individuals were positive for D. folliculorum; and, among them, 63 (53.4%) were women and 55 (46.6%) were men. Results showed a negative correlation with the age (r = −0.45), the highest prevalence was found in individuals between 19 and 22 years of age (2.1%, 84 patients). The number of D. folliculorum mites did not differ between the right and left eye; however, the use of cosmetics or facial cream, contact lens, hair removers, were factors present in patients infected with D. folliculorum. Although Demodex prevalence did not increase in line with weight, we found significantly higher prevalence in the 51–60 kg and 71–80 kg weight groups, and a particularly high prevalence in the over 81 kg weight group (2.6%). In conclusion, it was observed that the main population positive to infection consisted of young adults; this is in contrast with the international evidence reporting a high rate of infection in older adults. Besides, our results suggest that items of daily use such as cosmetics, facial cream, eyeliner, glasses, or contact lenses may be some of the main culprits of the infection by D. folliculorum.",

    "abstract": "Acinetobacter baumannii, as a nosocomial pathogen has become a worldwide concern in recent years. In the current study, the resistance to tetracyclines and colistin were assessed in the isolates from different provinces of Iran.During the timeline of this study, a number of 270 isolates of A. baumannii were collected from tracheal aspirates, wounds, urine and blood cultures. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, tigecycline and colistin were evaluated. Tetracycline resistance genes were assessed by PCR. The mean expression level of adeB, adeJ and adeG were assessed using semi quantitative Real-Time PCR. The clonal relationship of the isolates was evaluated by the repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR (REP-PCR), International Clonal (IC) Lineage Multiplex PCR and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) (Pasteur scheme) methods.The MIC by microdilution method showed that 87.5, 51.4, 28, 0.74 and 0% of the isolates were resistant to tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, tigecycline and colistin respectively. The prevalence of tetracycline resistance genes was 99.2, 99.2, 98, 86.7, 10, 3.33, 0.37, 0% for adeB, adeJ, adeG, tetB, tetA(39), tetA, tetM and tetH in tetracycline-resistant isolates. Moreover, the expression level of adeB, adeJ, adeG genes in tigecycline-nonsusceptible A. baumannii (TNAB) strain was higher compared to the tigecycline-susceptible A. baumannii (TSAB). A broad genomic diversity was revealed, but ST2 was the most prevalent ST. Our results indicated that tetracycline resistance in Iran is mediated by resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) and tetB efflux pumps.",

OXA-48 carbapenemase is the most difficult type to determine and accurate diagnosis is crucial especially in endemic areas.The CarbaNP test was described as a rapid phenotypic evaluation method of carbapenemases activity. Sensitivity and specifity of this test were high within all carbapenemases genes. In our study, we evaluated the efficacy of CarbaNP test in routine laboratories located in an endemic area of OXA-48 producing Enterobacterales.A total of 53 Enterobacterales isolates were included in this study. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates to imipenem, meropenem and ertapenem was determined. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was carried out for the detection of carbapenemases genes (blaKPC, blaNDM, blaBIC, blaIMP, blaVIM, blaSPM, blaAIM, blaDIM, blaGIM, blaSIM, and blaOXA-48). The Carba NP test was performed as in the protocol described previously.Altogether 31 isolates (58.4%) were blaOXA-48 positive (18 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 Escherichia coli, 2 Serratia marcescens, 1 Enterobacter aerogenes, 1 Pantoea agglomerans and 1 Morganella morganii). Among these isolates 3 (5.6%) and 2 (3.7%) isolates were also positive for blaVIM and blaSPM, respectively.The sensitivity and specifity of CarbaNP test were found 64.5, and 68.2% respectively. It was observed that determination of positive isolates is hard to distinguish and subjective.The CarbaNP test has suboptimal results and low of sensitivity and specifity for detection of OXA-48 producing Enterobacterales, and not suitable for detection of blaOXA-48 positive isolates in routine laboratories in endemic areas.",

This is the first report of detection of dermatophytes and their antifungal drug resistance in the Northern and Western parts of Pakistan. A total of 154 samples were collected from different hospitals of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and out of them 136 samples were found positive. Tinea corporis (35%) was the most predominant type of infection followed by Tinea capitis (22%). The fungi identified in Tinea corporis infection types were identified as Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton floccosum . The fungi identified in Tinea capitis included Trichophyton violaceum, T. mentagrophytes, Microsporum ferrugineum . The gender wise distribution showed both males (52%) and females (48%) were infected with the fungi. More cases belonged to the rural parts of the country. Age wise distribution showed that the infection was more prevalent in the children and the prevalence decreased with the increase in age. The positive samples were checked against two antifungal agents: fluconazole and nystatin. Among 136 positive samples, none of the isolates showed resistance to nystatin while 7% of the samples showed resistance to fluconazole. The resistant isolates were then identified by amplifying the 18S rRNA gene, using universal primers (ITS1, ITS4). Among the 9 resistant isolates, 5 isolates were identified as Trichophyton spp., 3 as Microsporum spp. and 1 as Epidermophyton spp.",

Moreover, the addition of PAF to the Δ paf strain resulted in a twofold increase in the apoptosis rate. PAF was also involved in the regulation of the autophagy machinery of this fungus, since several Saccharomyces cerevisiae autophagy-related ortholog genes, e.g. those of atg7, atg22 and tipA , were repressed in the deletion strain. This phenomenon was accompanied by the absence of autophagosomes in the Δ paf strain, even in old hyphae.",

Overall resistance rates were amoxicillin 7.5%, metronidazole 25.5%, clarithromycin 34.0% and ciprofloxacin 14.1%. There were no significant differences in resistance rates according to patients' age (2-6 and 7-18 years) and sex. Combined resistance rate was 19.8%, including double, triple, and quadruple resistance in 13.2% (14 strains), 5.7% (6) and 0.9% (1) of the strains, respectively. MDR was found in 5.9% (5/84) of the children with gastritis and in two of the four children with celiac disease. The MDR was present in three children aged 4-6 years and in four children aged 10-17 years. The total MDR rate (6.6%) in Bulgarian children in 2012-2021 was higher than those in other studies based on EUCAST breakpoints such as those in pediatric patients in Slovenia in 2011-2014 (3.8%), Lithuania in 2013-2015 (0%) and Spain in 2014-2019 (0%), although being lower than those (20.7% in the untreated and 47.0% in the treated children) in China in 2019. In brief, it is of concern that MDR can strongly limit the choice of H. pylori therapy of one out of fifteen Bulgarian children and that overall resistance to both metronidazole and clarithromycin can hinder the treatment of 15.1% of the pediatric patients. Susceptibility-guided tailored eradication therapy of H. pylori infection should be more frequently implemented in the symptomatic children to avoid risks of both the infection itself and multiple antibiotic treatments.",

In this study, the prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance and virulence determinants among ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates was investigated. A total of 50 third-generation cephalosporin resistant K. pneumoniae strains were collected from patients’ clinical cultures between September 1st, 2019 and February 30th, 2020. Clonal relatedness of clinical isolates was determined by multilocus sequence typing. All 50 isolates were multidrug-resistant (MDR) and carried at least one of the ESBL resistance determinants. The bla CTX-M-15 gene was the major ESBL determinant found in K. pneumoniae (88%), followed by bla SHV (86%) and bla TEM (78%). PMQR was detected in 96% of the isolates and aac(6′)-Ib-cr was the most common (78%) as well as multiple mutations in gyrA (S83I, D87G) and parC (S80I) were found. Selected isolates were assigned to seven sequence types (STs) (ST11, ST893, ST147, ST16, ST377, ST13, and ST392). Overall, hypervirulent phenotypes were identiﬁed in 26 (52%) of the isolates.

The K1 capsular type was the most prevalent (11/50; 22%) among isolates. The emergence of hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKp) ST11 and ST893, which co-carried ESBL, PMQR determinants and different virulence genes has become a threat to the treatment of inpatients in the clinical setting.",

The current study aimed to analyze antibiotic resistance genes and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of P. aeruginosa strains isolated from burn patients in Shahid Motahari hospital in Tehran, Iran.Altogether 63 P. aeruginosa isolates were characterized in this study. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by disc diffusion method. PCR was performed to determine the frequency of resistance genes. The expression rates of mexB, mexY genes were evaluated by Real-Time PCR. Genotyping of isolates was performed by MLST analysis. All isolates were MDR in this study. The highest resistance was detected against gentamicin, tobramycin, and cefoxitin (100%), while all isolates were susceptible to colistin. Altogether 14 resistance profiles were determined, and profile 1 included more than 50% of the isolates with the highest resistance. In this study blaampC, blaVIM-2, blaOXA-10, and aac(6')-Ib resistance genes were detected in all isolates. The expression levels of mexB and mexY genes were upregulated in 66.6 and 88.8% of MDR isolates, respectively. Overexpression of both genes was detected in 55.5% of the isolates.MLST analysis revealed five sequence types (STs), including ST235, ST664, ST532, ST2637, and ST230, which showed a significant relationship with antibiotic resistance profiles. The present study indicates an increase in antibiotic resistance against different antibiotic families among P. aeruginosa isolates.

    "abstract": "Following the introduction of the West Nile virus (WNV) into Hungary in 2004, it has shortly become one of the most important human arbovirus infections, with a gradually increasing number of cases. The study aimed to summarize the current epidemiological situation in Hungary and sequence the WNV PCR-positive clinical specimens and virus isolates by next-generation whole genome sequencing (NGS) to obtain a detailed phylogenetic analysis of the circulating virus strains. Whole blood and urine samples from confirmed WNV-infected patients and WNV isolates were investigated by reverse transcription PCR assays. Genome sequencing was carried out by Sanger-method, followed by NGS on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Altogether 499 human infections were diagnosed between 2004 and 2022. A particularly remarkable increase in human WNV infections was observed in 2018, while the number of reported cases significantly decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Between 2015 and 2022, 15 WNV isolates, and 10 PCR-positive clinical specimens were investigated by NGS. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the major European WNV lineage 2 clades, namely the Eastern European (or Russian) and the Central European (or Hungarian) clades, are presented in Hungary. Strains of the Balkan and other European clusters within the Central European clade are co-circulating in the country, following a characteristic geographical distribution. In Hungary, the presence and co-circulation of multiple lineage 2 WNV strains could be identified in the last few years. Therefore, in light of the 2018 WNV outbreak, sequence-based typing of the currently circulating strains could highly support outbreak investigations.",

    "abstract": "The study aimed to investigate prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) blood culture isolates and their susceptibility to two new antibiotics, imipenem/relebactam and ceftazidime/avibactam. Out of 765 isolates recovered from blood cultures in a tertiary care hospital in Serbia between 2020 and 2023, 143 non-repetitive K. pneumoniae strains were included in this study. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of the examined antimicrobial drugs was determined by VITEK 2 system, MIC test strip (imipenem/relebactam and ceftazidime/avibactam), and broth microdilution method (tigecycline and colistin). Carbapenemase-encoding genes (blaKPC, blaOXA-48-like, blaNDM, blaVIM, blaIMP) were detected using a multiplex-PCR assay, the BioFire-Blood Culture Identification 2-panel. This closed molecular assay is designed for the BioFire® FilmArray® system, enabling automated sample preparation, amplification, detection, and analysis (bioMérieux, France). Results revealed that K. pneumoniae was the most common isolate from blood cultures in 2022. The prevalence of K. pneumoniae was about 11.6% in 2020 and 2021, while in 2022 it raised to over 30%. Also, the frequency of CRKP increased from 11.76% in 2020, through 15.29% in 2021 to 72.94% in 2022. The majority of CRKP carried blaOXA-48-like (60.0%), followed by blaKPC (16.47%), and blaNDM (8.24%) genes, while 14.12% harboured both blaOXA-48-like and blaNDM genes. Only 25.88% of CRKP isolates were resistant to ceftazidime/avibactam, while 51.76% were resistant to imipenem/relebactam and colistin. The rapid spread of CRKP is particularly concerning because therapeutic options are limited to a few antibiotics. While imipenem/relebactam and colistin showed similar antimicrobial activity against CRKP clinical isolates, ceftazidime/avibactam proved to be the most effective antibiotic.",

    "abstract": "Despite of differences in replication strategy among virus families, some basic principles have remained similar. Analogous mechanisms govern virus entry into cells and the use of enzymes which direct the replication of the virus genome. The function of many cell surface receptors (such as glycosoaminoglycans, glycoproteins, proteins) which interact with viral capsid proteins or envelope glycoproteins has recently been elucidated. The list of cellular receptors (Table I) is still far from being final. The capsid components, similarly as the envelope glycoproteins, may form specific pocket like sites, which interact with the cell surface receptors. Neutralizing antibodies usually react with antigenic domains adjacent to the receptor binding site(s) and hamper the close contact inevitable for virion attachment. In the case of more complex viruses, such as herpes simplex virus, different viral glycoproteins interact with several cellular receptors. At progressed phase of adsorption the virions are engulfed into endocytic vesicles and the virion fusion domain(s) become(s) activated. The outer capsid components of reoviruses which participate in adsorption and fusion may get activated already in the lumen of digestive tract, i.e. before their engulfement by resorptive epithelium cells. Activation of the hydrophobic fusion domain(s) is a further important step allowing to pass through the lipid bilayer when penetrating the cell membrane in order to reach the cytosol. Activation of the virion fusion domain is accomplished by a conformation change, which occurs at acid pH (influenza virus hemagglutinin, s1 protein of the reovirus particle) and/or after protease treatment. The herpes simplex virus fusion factors (gD and gH) undergo conformation changes by a pH-independent mechanism triggered due to interaction with the cell surface receptor(s) and mediated by mutual interactions with the viral envelope glycoproteins. The virion capsid or envelope components participating in the entry and membrane fusion are not the only tools of virulence. The correct function of virus coded proteins, which participate in replication of the viral genome, and/or in the supply of necessary nucleotides, may be very essential. In the case of enteroviruses, which RNA ineracts with ribosomes directly, the correct configuration of the non-coding viral RNA sequence is crucial for initiation of translation occurring in the absence of the classical \"cap\" structure.",

    "abstract": "In this review, we discuss the developments of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and place them in the context of their applications in cancer research. These methods are not only very useful for the causal analysis of the development and spread of certain tumors, they are also efficient tools for tumor diagnosis. Although a review of all of the literature in this field is not possible here, many of the major contributions are summarized along with recent work from our laboratory. Our group contributes to the goal of functional identification of tumor growth antagonizing genes. FISH and molecular analyses have shown that the short arm of human chromosome 3 is frequently deleted in kidney, lung, breast, uterus, testis and ovary carcinomas. Deletion-mapping studies have outlined several separate deletion prone regions in different tumors, namely 3pter-p25, p22-p21.3, p21.1-p14 and p14-p12, which may contain putative tumor suppressor genes (TSGs). Candidate suppressor genes isolated from frequently deleted regions need to be assayed for possible tumor-antagonizing ability by functional tests. We have developed a functional test system, the microcell hybrid (MCH) based \"elimination test” (Et). The Et is based on the introduction of a single human chromosome into tumor cells of human or murine origin, via microcell fusion. The MCHs were analyzed by FISH painting and PCR for the elimination or retention of specific human chromosome 3 (chr. 3) regions after one or several passages in severe combined immune-deficient (SCID) mice. We have defined a common eliminated region (CER) on chr. 3p2I.3. CER is approximately 1 megabase (Mb) in size. We have covered this region with PACs (bacteriophage PI based artificial chromosome) and used FISH mapping for localization and ordering PACs and cosmids on the chromosome 3 and high-resolution free chromatin/DNA fiber FISH to orient the PAC contig, to measure the lengths of PACs, and to establish their order. Activation of cellular oncogene by chromosomal translocation, which brings an oncogene under the influence of a highly active chromosome region, appears to play a pivotal role in the genesis of certain hematopoetic and lymphoid tumors. We have detected specific chromosomal translocations by FISH painting in mouse plasmacytoma (MPC), human Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and other B-cell derived tumors. We have showed in a murine sarcoma derived line (SEWA) that FISH can also be used for detection of amplified oncogene (c-myc) and the linked locus (pvt-1). We have also applied the FISH technique for visualization of integrated and episomal Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genomes and EBV transcripts in EBV-carrying B-cell derived human cell lines.",

It has been standing in the focus of interest since the early 1990s, mostly because of the frequency of otitis externa and dermatitis caused by this yeast in dogs. This is the only lipid-independent species in the genus Malassezia . It can be found in very large proportion on the skin of healthy animals, but can be isolated in much greater number from diseased dogs. It often causes illness together with other pathogens (e.g. Staphylococcus intermedius ). Some breeds are predisposed. In addition to the treatment of the accidental concurrent diseases, therapy consists of systemic and/or topical antimicrobial treatment. Ketoconazole is used most frequently. Malassezia pachydermatis plays also a role in the skin disorders of other carnivores. It has little zoonotic potential, it can be dangerous to immunocompromised humans. The other Malassezia species have little veterinary importance, although M. sympodialis and M. globosa were isolated from asymptomatic animals (mostly cats) and from mixed infections.",

    "abstract": "Roots of classical yeast genetics go back to the early work of Lindegreen in the 1930s, who studied thallism, sporulation and inheritance of wine yeast strains belonging to S. cerevisiae . Consequent mutation and hybridization of heterothallic S. cerevisae strains resulted in the discovery of life cycle and mating type system, as well as construction of the genetic map. Elaboration of induced mutation and controlled hybridization of yeast strains opened up new possibilities for the genetic analysis of technologically important properties and for the production of improved industrial strains, but a big drawback was the widely different genetic properties of laboratory and industrial yeast strains. Genetic analysis and mapping of industrial strains were generally hindered because of homothallism, poor sporulation and/or low spore viability of brewing and wine yeast strains [1, 2]. In spite of this, there are a few examples of the application of sexual hybridization in the study of genetic control of important technological properties, e.g. sugar utilization, flocculation and flavor production in brewing yeast strains [3] or in the improvement of ethanol producing S. cerevisiae strains [4]. Rare mating and application of karyogamy deficient (kar − ) mutants also proved useful in strain improvement [5].Importance of yeasts in biotechnology is enormous. This includes food and beverage fermentation processes where a wide range of yeast species are playing role, but S. cerevisiae is undoubtedly the most important species among them. New biotechnology is aiming to improve these technologies, but besides this, a completely new area of yeast utilization has been emerged, especially in the pharmaceutical and medical areas. Without decreasing the importance of S. cerevisiae , numerous other yeast species, e.g. Kluyveromyces lactis, Hansenula polymorpha, Pichia pastoris, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Yarrowia lipolytica have gained increasing potentialities in the modern fermentation biotechnology [6].Developments in yeast genetics, biochemistry, physiology and process engineering provided bases of rapid development in modern biotechnology, but elaboration of the recombinant DNA technique is far the most important milestone in this field. Other molecular genetic techniques, as molecular genotyping of yeast strains proved also very beneficial in yeast fermentation technologies, because dynamics of both the natural and inoculated yeast biota could be followed by these versatile DNA-based techniques.",

Fifty-six isolates that were rifampicin-sensitive and belonged to Enterobacteriaceae family were chosen as donors for the conjugal transfer assay. Eighteen of the isolates successfully transferred conjugable plasmids to the E. coli DH5alpha recipient. Countable multiple antibiotic resistant transconjugants arose readily and conjugal transfer frequency was in the range of 3.75 x 10(-6) to 1.0 x 10(-1). The most common carriage of resistances conferred by transmissible R plasmids was against ampicillin, cefotaxim and cephalexin. The residence of class 1 integrons on conjugative R plasmids was confirmed in only six transconjugants. Gene cassettes borne on the integrons were identified to be dihydrofolate reductases (dhfrs). The major concern of this study was about the copiotrophs containing self-transmissible R plasmids which may be potential reservoirs of antibiotic-resistance genes and instrumental in dissemination of the same in the environment.",

The variability of the symptoms produced by the smut fungi on their host plants, and the great morphological diversity of the spores is illustrated by selected pictures. Trends and perspectives in the research of the taxonomy of smut fungi are discussed. On the occasion of the imminent world monograph of smut fungi the necessity for urgent measures ensuring their global conservation is stressed. If present trends of habitat destruction continue, caused in large part by the human population explosion, many of the estimated 4000 to 4500 species of smut fungi become extinct before they are even discovered.",

Statistical analysis of the electronic nose measurements were principal component analysis (PCA), and canonical discriminant analysis (CDA). Partial least squares (PLS) regression was used to model correlation between microbial loads and EN signal responses, the degree of bacteriological spoilage, independently of the temperature of the refrigerated storage. Sensor selection techniques were applied to reduce the dimensionality and more robust calibration models were computed by determining few individual sensors having the smallest cross correlations and highest correlations with the reference data. Correlations between the predicted and “real” values were given on cross-validated data from both data reduced models and for full calibrations using the 23 sensor elements. At the same time, sensorial quality of the raw cutlets was noted subjectively on faultiness of the odour and colour, and drip formation of the samples. These preliminary studies indicated that the electronic nose technique has a potential to detect bacteriological spoilage earlier or at the same time as olfactory quality deterioration.",

Canvasses with the highest incidence of dermatophytes (25 out of 34 fungal isolates) were the most contaminated kits and could serve as effective articles for the transmission of tinea pedis among athletes in Nigeria. The common etiological agents screened, produced asexual spores (conidiospores) that exhibited high resistance to heat treatment at 80 degrees C. Of the three isolates, E. floccosum, with a decimal reduction time (D-value) of D80 = 4.4 min was the most resistant followed by T. mentagrophytes with D80 = 4.0 min and then T. rubrum with D80 = 3.2 min. The spores elimination pattern indicates that increasing the heating duration would decrease the decimal reduction time and possibly denature the fungal propagules but may damage the skin during treatment with hot water compresses. The findings have shown that the use of hot water compresses is palliative but heat treatment especially vapour-heat treatment offers adequate preventive measures if applied for periodic treatment of contaminated kits. However, determining the correct condition for effective decontamination will require detailed understanding of the heat resistance of fungal spores. Otherwise treatment of kits with detergent and chaotropic agent such as urea and guanidinium salt is preferred to heat treatment.",

Recent primary infection was documented in 8.9% of the IgM positive and 3.5% of the IgM negative patients. In patients with indeterminate serology (equivocal IgM), 6.7% were classified by avidity index (AI) as acute primary infection, 10.0% as post-acute and 83.3% as past infection cases.Concerning the 32 immunocompromised patients, recent primary infection was documented in 3 of the 14 IgM positive patients. High AI was detected in 11 of these patients, indicating an IgM response due to reactivation.Determination of IgG avidity in combination with classical serologic markers seems to be a reliable method to confirm primary infection both in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. It may be especially useful to differentiate cases of primary infection in patients with undetectable VCA-IgM antibodies or indeterminate routine EBV serology.",

    "abstract": "In the recent years, it has been noted that microorganisms with acquired resistance to almost all available potent antibiotics are increasing worldwide. Hence, the use of antibiotics in every clinical setup has to be organized to avoid irrational use of antibiotics. This study was aimed to establish the pattern of antibiotic sensitivity and relevance of antimicrobial resistance in aerobic Gram-negative bacilli. A total of 103 aerobic Gram-negative bacteria namely Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter koserii, Proteus spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were collected from tertiary care centers around Chennai. Kirby-Bauer Disk Diffusion test and study for genes of cephalosporin, carbapenem, and aminoglycoside resistance were done. A descriptive analysis of the data on altogether 103 clinical urine isolates was performed. All strains showed susceptibility to colistin. The frequency of genes encoding 16S rRNA methylases armA and rmtB were 7.8% and 6.8%, respectively. Among metallo-β-lactamases, blaVIM, blaIMP, and blaNDM-1 were detected in 6.8%, 3.8%, and 3.8%, respectively. One E. coli strain harbored blaSIM-1 gene. Cumulative analysis of data suggested that 30% of the strains carried more than one resistance gene. The current research evidenced the increasing frequency of resistance mechanisms in India. Combined approach of antibiotic restriction, effective surveillance, and good infection control practices are essential to overcome antibiotic resistance.",

The aim of this study was to detect the frequency of fosA3 and fosC2 genes in extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) and blaDHA, blaCMY-2, and blaCMY-42 genes in AmpC β-lactamases-producing isolates of Escherichia coli. In total, 120 isolates of E. coli were collected from three teaching hospitals between March 2014 and February 2015. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were carried out by disk diffusion method. The presence of blaCMY-2, blaCMY-42, blaDHA, fosA3, and fosC2 genes was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Of the 120 strains, 92 (76.6%) were identified as ESBL producers, 30 (25%) were determined as AmpC β-lactamase producers, and 24 (20%) had both ESBL and AmpC β-lactamase enzymes. Imipenem, fosfomycin, and nitrofurantoin had the best effect against isolates of E. coli. PCR assay demonstrated that the frequency of blaCMY-2, blaCMY-42, and blaDHA genes among AmpC β-lactamases-producing strains were 39%, 1%, and 17.5%, respectively. This study reports the first detection of fosfomycin resistance in Iran. This study indicated the increasing prevalence of UTI isolates of E. coli-harboring ESBL and AmpC β-lactamases genes in Iran. Therefore, due to the high rate of blaDHA and blaCMY genes and emergence of fosfomycin-resistant E. coli isolates, we recommend continuous monitoring of antibiotic resistance as well as attention to guidelines of infection controls.",

This refers to the harmful genotoxic (mutagenic, teratogenic, and carcinogenic) effects of mycotoxins on the one hand, and their cytocidic and antineoplastic properties on the other hand. This \"double edged sword\" effect could be utilized against the spread of tumors in older patients when the survival is much more important than the mutagenic side effects. To decide which fungal toxins could be used as combined cytotoxic and antimetastatic agents, mycotoxins were divided into three categories: (a) highly genotoxic (mutagenic, teratogenic, and carcinogenic), (b) adversely toxic, and (c) antitumorigenic agents. Highly cytotoxic mycotoxins with tolerable side effects, combined with an antineoplastic character, could be potential candidates against metastasis. From the structure-function relationship of antimetastatic mycotoxins, only general conclusions have been drawn. The presence of ring structures containing heteroatoms, functional groups, and the cumulative presence of oxygen atoms contributed to the oxidative stress and cytotoxicity of mycotoxins.

    "abstract": "As an important global health challenge, diarrhea kills nearly two million people each year. Postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) usually manifests itself as the diarrhea-predominant subtype. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth has been observed more frequently in patients with IBS compared to healthy controls. However, the pathophysiology of IBS is not fully understood, and based on recent evidences, altered gut microbiota is involved in the pathogenesis of IBS. Therefore, we aimed to compare the microbiome in hospitalized patients with diarrhea and healthy individuals. Thirty patients and 10 healthy controls were included into this case–control study. Microbial count was performed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction method using bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Clostridium cluster IV and Bacteroides were significantly more frequent in the patients compared with the healthy individuals ( p = 0.02 and 0.023, respectively). However, the quantity of Enterococcus and Bifidobacterium groups were significantly higher in healthy controls than in diarrheal group ( p = 0.000076 and 0.001, respectively). The results showed that the number of bacteria in all bacterial groups was significantly different between healthy individuals and diabetic group, whereas the difference between the healthy group and IBS was not significant for Bifidobacterium group. The findings of this study outlined the relationship between diarrhea, IBS, and diabetes disease and bacterial composition. It could be concluded that modifying the bacterial composition by probiotics can be helpful in the control and management of the mentioned disease.",

In this study, 65 multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from different clinical samples were included. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of colistin was detected by broth microdilution method in three different ways. For selected K. pneumoniae strains, eazyplex SuperBug mcr-1 test was performed. This test detects mcr-1 gene, which encodes a colistin-resistance determinant. Most of the analyzed K. pneumoniae strains were resistant to colistin in all applied methods. The exception was two strains, where MIC of colistin was 2 mg/L in SensiTest Colistin and MIC-Strip Colistin tests. In MIC COL test, MIC for these strains was 4 mg/L. All analyzed strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and 11 (16.9%) metallo-beta-lactamases. Eleven (16.9%) K. pneumoniae strains were resistant to all antibiotics, whereas 17 (26.1%) were susceptible to only one drug. Colistin MIC values varied from 2 to >64 mg/L in MIC-Strip Colistin test; from 2 to >16 mg/L in SensiTest Colistin and from 4 to >16 mg/L in MIC COL test. None of the analyzed K. pneumoniae strains carried mcr-1 gene. Data of this work suggest that resistance to colistin emerged among multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae strains. The tests allowed for reliable estimation of susceptibility to colistin and could be used in microbiological diagnostics.",

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the proportion of CRAB isolates and to compare gradient test with a broth microdilution (BMD) method for tigecycline susceptibility testing of A. baumannii . This study included 349 multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter spp. collected from Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2016 and 2017. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by disk diffusion, VITEK2, gradient, ComASP Colistin. Tigecycline susceptibilities were interpreted according to breakpoints of European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Majority of the tested isolates were CRAB (92.8%). Tigecycline MIC 50 /MIC 90 values were 4/8 μg/mL by BMD and 0.5/4 μg/mL by gradient test. Essential agreement for BMD and gradient test amounted to 65.1%. With EUCAST breakpoints, categorical agreement (CA) was achieved in 38% isolates. Major discordance (MD-false susceptibility/resistance) and minor discordance (mD-false categorization involving intermediate results) were observed in 10% and 57% A. baumannii , respectively. With FDA breakpoints, CA, MD and mD were observed in 44%, 16% and 47% isolates, respectively. Colistin resistance was 2.1%. The study highlights a high proportion of CRAB and several discordances between BMD and gradient test which may lead to inappropriate therapy.",

Infusions facilitating bacterial growth may be a source of central line-associated bloodstream infections. On the other hand, medications that kill bacteria may protect against this kind of infection and may be used as a catheter lock. In this study, we examined the impact of amiodarone on bacterial growth. Amiodarone is used for controlling cardiac arrhythmias and can be administered as an infusion for weeks. Standard microbiological methods have been used to study the growth of laboratory strains and clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in amiodarone. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of amiodarone was determined. Bacterial growth from in use amiodarone syringes and giving sets was also investigated. Most examined strains were killed within 1 min in amiodarone. The other strains were killed within 1 h. The MICs of amiodarone were &lt;0.5–32 μg/mL. Amiodarone infusion is unlikely to be responsible for bloodstream infections as contaminating bacteria are killed within 1 h. Amiodarone may also protect against central line infections if used as a catheter lock.",

Whole genome sequencing was done by Illumina NovaSeq 6,000 platform and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed by Oxford and Pasteur typing schemes. Influence of imipenem and levofloxacin on biofilm formation was investigated in 96-well plates at 3 replicates. The strain was found to carry OXA-23, OXA-51-like, AmpC and TEM-1 beta-lactamases. The sequence of the blaOXA-51-like gene has been identified as a blaOXA-66. According to Pasteur MLST scheme the strain displayed ST2 allelic profile. However, based on Oxford MLST scheme this strain represents the new ST2121, as the gdhB gene has a single allelic mutation namely, the gdhB-227. It was determined that MDR isolate carried bap, basABCDFGHIJ, csuA/BABCDE, bauABCDEF, plcD, pgaABCD, entE, barAB, ompA, abaIR, piT2EAFTE/AUBl, fimADT, cvaC, bfmR, bfmS virulence genes.

Sample collection and DNA extraction were done on blood (n = 135) and lymph node (n = 135) samples collected from 135 camels (abattoir survey) from both sexes at various ages in different seasons. The real-time PCR for species differentiation was based on unique genetic loci of B. melitensis and B. abortus . The regions were chosen for the construction of primers and TaqMan® probes for species differentiation: BMEII0466 gene for B. melitensis and Bru-Ab2_0168 gene for B. abortus. Brucella spp. were identified in 18 (13.33%) blood samples and 4 (2.97%) lymph node samples. This method showed to be effective in detecting B. abortus and B. melitensis in blood and lymph samples respectively. Brucella abortus was detected in 3 (2.22%) blood samples but was however, not detected in the lymph node samples. Brucella melitensis was only observed in 4 (2.97%) lymph node samples.

The lineage-independent presence of ACTH and T3 in differentiating hematopoietic cells denotes that their expression ubiquitous during lymphocyte development. Higher ACTH and T3 content of B cells shows that these cells are the most hormonally active and suggests that the hormones may have an autocrine regulatory role in B cell development.

The present study aimed to investigate clonal spread, virulence and antimicrobial resistance rates of Bulgarian MRSA isolates in 2016-2020.Molecular identification and mecA gene detection were performed with PCR. Clonal relatedness was evaluated by RAPD PCR and MLST. MRSA epidemiology, virulence and resistance patterns were investigated by PCR.All 27 isolates were identified as S. aureus and were mecA positive, and all were susceptible to linezolid, tigecycline and vancomycin. The toxin genes hlg (in 92.6% of isolates), seb (77.8%), sei (77.8%), seh (59.3%), sej (55.6%), and seg (48.1%), were frequently found among the isolates. Epidemiological typing by RAPD identified 4 clones (16 isolates) and 11 were with a unique profile. MLST analysis of the same MRSA isolates showed five MLST clonal complexes and 11 ST types, including CC5 (33.3%) (ST5, ST221, ST4776), CC8 (22.2%) (ST8, ST239, ST72), CC15 (ST582), CC22 (14.8%) (ST217, ST5417), CC30 (ST30) CC398 (ST398), and CC59 (ST59). The isolates from CC5 showed higher virulence potential and almost all were macrolide resistant (ermB or ermC positive). CC8 isolates showed higher level of resistance.To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first describing the clonal spreading of Bulgarian MRSA and the association with their virulence and resistance determinants. Monitoring of MRSA epidemiology, resistance and virulence profile can lead to better prevention and faster therapeutic choice in cases of severe infections.",

The aim of this study was to reveal the prevalence and mechanisms of colistin resistance among multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates collected in Bulgaria. One hundred multidrug resistant K. pneumoniae isolates were collected in a period between 2017 and 2018. Among them, 29 colistin resistant and 8 heteroresistant isolates were observed and further investigated. Clonal relatedness was detected by RAPD and MLST. Сarbapenemases, two component system phoQ/phoP, pmrA/B, and mgrB were investigated by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing. Among 37 colistin nonsusceptible isolates, we detected 25 NDM-1 producers. The isolates belonged mainly to ST11 (80%), and also to ST147, ST35, ST340, ST219 (1-2 members per clone). Nine colistin resistant isolates showed changes in mgrB. IS903B-like elements truncated mgrB in five isolates. In two isolates, premature stopcodon (Q30stopcodon) was observed and another two isolates did not amplify mgrB, possibly due to bigger deletion or insertion. No isolates showed phoQ/phoP and pmrA/B mutations except for pmrB (four isolates had R256G). All isolates with IS903B insertions belonged to ST11 clone. The mgrB alterations play major role in colistin resistance in K. pneumoniae isolates studied in the current work. We report truncation of mgrB by IS903 like element in colistin resistant NDM-1 producing K. pneumoniae ST11 clone in Bulgaria.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We evaluated the activity of meropenem-vaborbactam against different beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli isolates. In our study antibiotic susceptibility testing, double disk synergy test, modified Hodge test were applied. Detection of ESBL, AmpC, and carbapenemase genes was performed by PCR. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis was done on OXA-48 producing K. pneumoniae strains. Our results showed that among E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates, 41.1% and 40% of strains produced ESBL, respectively. Additionally, the prevalence of AmpC producing K. pneumoniae and E. coli was 4% and 45.5%, respectively. Altogether 64.2% of K. pneumoniae strains and one E. coli isolate produced carbapenemase. Among OXA-48 producing K. pneumoniae strains ST3500 and ST2528 were detected by MLST. Based on the phenotypic results of this study, vaborbactam was an effective inhibitor on the third-generation cephalosporin-resistant isolates ( P &lt; 0.0001). Meropenem-vaborbactam combination had the highest efficacy on KPC producing strains, and it had limited activity on isolates producing OXA-48 type beta-lactamases, whereas no effect was observed on NDM-1 producing isolates. Our study provided valuable information regarding the vaborbactam inhibitory effect on β -lactamase-producing strains.",

The pathogens have the ability to produce aflatoxin B1 and G1, diacetoxyscirpenol, kojic acid and tenuazonic acid that reduced seedling viability. The inhibition dose for 50% reduction (LD50) was recorded by aflatoxins at 0.83 mg L-1 for barley, 1.74 mg L-1 for wheat and 2.75 mg L-1 for sorghum. Diacetoxyscirpenol produced its inhibition at 1.26 mg L-1 for barley, 3.98 mg L-1 for wheat and 10 mg L-1 for sorghum. Kojic acid induced 50% inhibition at 63 mg L-1 for barley, 105 mg L-1 for wheat and 251 mg L-1 for sorghum. However, tenuazonic acid was less toxic where, the toxicity was ranged between 79-550 mg L-1. The inhibition in germination was more pronounced in barley followed by wheat and negligible in sorghum to all tested mycotoxins. This inhibition attributed to the reduction in seedling amylase activity. Amylase was also reduced in the same trend: barley > wheat > sorghum. Grain treatment with carboxin-captan and thiophanatemethyl-thiram at 1 g kg-1 grain increased seedlings vigour of wheat in sterilized soil by 45 and 22%, barley by 24 and 33% and sorghum by 15 and 30%, respectively. These fungicides have also a positive effect on cereal when soil was inoculated with A. flavus, A. alternata and F. oxysporum.",

    "abstract": "The interaction between the bacteria and the host is a key factor determining the clinical consequences of H. pylori infection. The immune system plays an important role in either promoting or preventing the disease. The mucosal production of TNF-a, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 and the CagA status were investigated in H. pylori-positive patients with duodenal ulcer (DU). The concentrations of these cytokines in gastric antral mucosal specimens from patients infected with H. pylori (n = 40) were determined by ELISA and compared with data on mucosal specimens from H. pylori-negative patients (n = 12). The local TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations in the antral biopsy samples were significantly higher (p < 0.001) in the patients infected with H. pylori than in the samples from the H. pylori-negative subjects. CagA positivity was demonstrated in 39 (97.5%) of the 40 patients with DU, and in 41 (70.7%) of H. pylori-positive (58 of 100) healthy blood donors. In complementary studies focusing on extragastric disease, it was found that 57% of patients with ischaemic heart disease were seropositive as concerns H. pylori, and 91% of them had antibodies against human heat shock protein 60, too. This study suggests that, besides the bacterial virulence factor, the host response of an increased mucosal production of inflammatory cytokines can be relevant to the gastric pathophysiology in H. pylori-induced DU. At the same time, in ischaemic heart diseases the role of autoimmune processes induced by H. pylori cannot be excluded.",

    "abstract": "The author of the monograph \"Cytolytic Immune Lymphocytes ...\" (published in 2008 by Schenk Buchverlag Campus Dialog, Budapest, Passau, Pécs) proposed several research projects and described certain clinical events that require further elaboration and documentation. In this article the author provides what is required and has since become available. The first subject matter in question concerns the fusogenic viruses. The ancient fusogenic viruses might have created the first eukaryotic cell(s) by uniting archaeabacterial and prokaryotic/protobacterial protospheroplasts. Extant fusogenic viruses either produce tumor cell syncytia and lyse them, thus practicing viral oncolysis. Or, create chimaeric fusion products, the socalled \"natural hybridomas\", of lymphoma cells exhibiting transmembrane budding of retrovirus particles or envelope proteins, and anti-viral specific antibody-producing plasma cells. The second topic concerns the horizontal-lateral mode of acquisition of those genes, which were \"present in the waiting\" in the amphioxus, sea urchin, and the agnathans, and met in the primitive gnatostomata sharks to encode in unison the entire adaptive immune system. The consensus of opinion is such that these genes derived from newly acquired transposons/retrotransposons. The author points out that the extant Epstein-Barr virus harbors genes displaying sequence homology with those genes from the sharks up to mammals that regulate the somatic hypermutation of specific antibody production. The author proposes that an ancient herpesvirus might have propagated the V(D)J and RAG genes from sea urchins to sharks. The third area is that of lymphocytes cytotoxic/cytolytic to virally infected or malignantly transformed host cells. This discovery led to the adoptive immune lymphocyte therapy of tumors. Installed in the adaptive immune system are regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells for he protection of \"self\". Tumor cells masquerading as \"self\" are protected by these cells from attacks launched by immune T cells. The author supports the replacement of IL-2 by IL-15, inasmuch as IL-2 stimulates not only immune T cells, but also regulatory T cells expressing the CD25 IL-2 receptor. The administration of low dose whole body radiotherapy prior to immune lymphocyte therapy increases the efficacy of immune lymphocyte therapy. The author observed this phenomenon in the mid-1960s. The explanation of this phenomenon revealed itself just recently. In pre-irradiated hosts the intestinal wall becomes permeable to the gut flora; the intestinal bacteria activate the entire innate immune system in the mesenteric lymph nodes and a rapid activation of the adaptive immune faculties follows.",

In this study, the occurrence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Legionella spp. was examined with taxon-specific PCRs in samples taken at ten points of a municipal drinking water supply system in three months. Sequence analysis confirmed the positivity of samples and revealed a diverse community of legionellae. The results showed that chlorination was an important and effective disinfection method against pathogenic bacteria in drinking water, but pathogenic bacteria could reoccur in the system farther away from the chlorination point. No strong correlation was found between the presence of the investigated potentially pathogenic bacteria and the measured abiotic and biotic parameters within the investigated range. It is hypothesized that instead of physicochemical parameters, the main factors influencing the presence of pathogens in the drinking water were rather the composition of the microbial community, the biotic interactions between individual non-pathogenic and pathogenic microorganisms (competition or promotion of growth) and the structure of biofilm grown on the inner surface of the supply system.",

Reactivity resided in the O-specific chain of LPS, and binding to the lipid A or core moieties of LPS could not be demonstrated by the present methods. The α -D-glucose or α -D-mannose residues of the repeating O-specific oligosaccharide units appeared to be recognized by ConA, except when blocked by steric hindrance. Specificity of the reaction was verified by inhibition with 2% D-glucose. Binding by bacterium-specific sugar-residues could not be demonstrated.For precipitation to occur, polyvalency was required both for LPS and ConA, and the resulting precipitation appeared to be promoted by hydrophobic interactions between the lipid A moieties of LPS molecules. The LPS species were differently retained by the agarose gel, which can be explained by differences in their micellar structure in aqueous solution. E. coli O83 LPS did not readily diffused in 1% agarose gel, but its precipitation with ConA could be demonstrated either at elevated temperature or mixing it previously with molten agarose (Mancini’s arrangement).",

    "abstract": "This review argues that syphilis has been underdiagnosed and undertreated, a problem that goes back to the beginning of the Wassermann era, and indeed long before. Non-treponemal tests do not detect the larger pool of persons with latent syphilis, the immunological consequences of which have not been systematically investigated in the context of HIV infection and progression to AIDS. Recent efforts to confirm the prevalence of syphilis in high-risk patients by reverse sequence screening, i.e. using a treponemal test first, as the screening test, have revealed untreated syphilis at higher rates than expected. Further testing using PCR discovered even more previously undetected cases. We suggest that latent syphilis is a chronic active immunological condition that drives the AIDS process and cannot be managed with the older Wassermann-based algorithm, and that non-treponemal tests have failed to associate syphilis with immune suppression since this screening concept was developed in 1906. In light of the overwhelming association between a past history of syphilis and HIV seroconversion, more sensitive tools, including recombinant antigen-based immunological tests and direct detection (PCR) technology, are needed to adequately assess the role of latent syphilis in persons with HIV/AIDS. Repeating older syphilis reinoculation studies may help establish a successful animal model for AIDS, and resolve many paradoxes in HIV science.",

In cell supernatants, interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-12, IL-18, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF- α ) levels were measured by ELISA. In vitro levamisole treatment accompanied by C. albicans stimulation significantly increased IL-12, IL-1 β and IL-18 production in macrophage cells (p &lt; 0.05). It was observed that when administered before C. albicans infection, levamisole significantly increased IL-12 and IL-1 β production in macrophage cells (p &lt; 0.05). Another finding was that when applied to macrophage cells simultaneously with C. albicans infection, or before infection with C. albicans , levamisole suppressed the TNF- β production stimulating effect of C. albicans (p &lt; 0.05).These results indicated that levamisole could be useful in treating patients infected with C. albicans or in protecting individuals under the risk of being infected with this pathogen. There is a need for further experimental and clinical studies on this hypothesis.",

A fragment of the preS1/preS2/S genes from all samples was amplified, the PCR products were sequenced and a rooted phylogenetic tree was constructed. All nucleotide sequences from the different patients were very similar and 6 of the 8 sequences were identical, suggesting a common origin of the infections. These sequences were closely related to those amplified from a nosocomial HBV epidemic in another hospital in Hungary. The on-scene investigation revealed several malpractices. The two hospital departments had close connections and some of the patients were treated in both institutions.

The conjugate pneumococcal vaccines (PCVs) were shown to have an impact on the colonisation, and so play an important role in inhibiting infections. In this study we compared the nasal carriage of healthy children attending DCCs in Szeged, Hungary in 2003/2004, when nobody was vaccinated, and in 2010, when already 1/5 of the children received PCV-7. Significant differences were observed in the serotype distribution, representing a marked shift from the previously widespread vaccine-types (mostly 6A or 14) to others (11A and 23F). The new serotypes showed higher antibiotic susceptibility. The bacterium exchange between children was clear from the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns, and the circulation of certain international clones plays also a role in these dynamic changes.",

Therefore, these proteins may play an important role in regulating apoptosis in normal and neoplastic cells. However, their cellular and tissue distribution has not been documented. The aim of this study was to determine the localization pattern of ASPP-2 in a variety of normal and malignant human tissues, including liver, lung, prostate, small intestine, kidney, ovary, bladder, cervix, breast, stomach, bowel, gallbladder, endometrium, pancreas, spleen and thyroid.The distribution and expression of ASPP-2 was assessed by immunohistochemistry in a range of formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded, benign and malignant human tissues, using a mouse monoclonal antibody against ASPP-2.The results showed a variable pattern of positivity of ASPP-2 within the tissues studied. ASPP-2 expression was localized in the cytoplasmic paranuclear granules in the epithelial cells of most of the organs we studied. The pattern of staining intensity of ASPP-2 correlated to the maturation state in benign tissue and to the differentiation state in the context of bladder cancer.This study indicates that ASPP-2 has a specific distribution pattern within tissues and cells in a way that appears to be related to differentiation. However, the patterns are neither simplistic nor straightforward and will require further investigation in order to appreciate fully their physiological/pathological significance.",

The phylogenetic affiliation of bacterial strains and molecular clones was determined based on their 16S rRNA gene sequences.

Besides the taxa identified by cultivation, members of the phyla Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Gemmatimonadetes were detected by the cloning. The difference in the composition of soil bacterial communities was related to geographic locations and soil types. Both the highest and the lowest bacterial diversities were detected in samples from Aggtelek National Park, characterized by Leptic Luvisol and Rendzic Leptosol soil types. The difference in the composition of bacterial communities between Rendzic Leptosol and Leptic Phaeozem soil types at Tapolca could be the result of human impacts.",

In this study, DNA was first extracted from the stool samples of infected individuals and used as DNA template to investigate the presence of glmM and 16S rRNA genes in PCR. The ELISA assay was employed to examine serum levels of TNF-α and IL-1β cytokines. According to statistical analysis, there was a significant correlation between the presence of glmM and 16S rRNA genes in the stool samples of infected persons and the serum oscillations of TNF-α and IL-1β cytokines. At the end of study and analysis of the data in case group with HPSAg+, 47.6% of the glmM gene and 23.6% of the 16S rRNA gene were positive. In addition, a significant correlation was observed between the presence of glmM and 16S rRNA genes in the stool specimens of infected individuals and the serum levels of TNF-α and IL-1β cytokines (p < 0.05). Considering the results, it can be concluded that fluctuations in the amount of HPSA, TNF-α, and IL-1β in H. pylori infection depend on the presence of glmM and 16S rRNA genes. The presence of glmM and 16S rRNA in the stool sample increases by boosting the response level to stool antigen (HPSA), IL-1β, and TNF-α, suggesting the prognosis of the disease with a bacterial virulence form using stool tests.",

Therefore, the elimination of biofilm is an essential step for the successful therapy of implant-related infections. In this work we created a basic in vitro model to evaluate the antibacterial effect of three widely used antiseptics. Commercially pure (CP4) titanium sample discs with sand blasted, acid etched, and polished surface were used. The discs were incubated with mono-cultures of Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus salivarius . The adhered bacterial biofilms were treated with different antiseptics: chlorhexidine-digluconate (CHX), povidone-iodine (PI), and chlorine dioxide (CD) for 5 min and the control discs with ultrapure water. The antibacterial effect of the antiseptics was tested by colorimetric assay. According to the results, the PI and the CD were statistically the most effective in the elimination of the two test bacteria on both titanium surfaces after 5 min treatment time. The CD showed significant effect only against S. salivarius . Based on our results we conclude that PI and CD may be promising antibacterial agents to disinfecting the peri-implant site in the dental practice.",

In conclusion, H. pylori infection was significantly associated with iron-deficiency anemia or/and weight loss in Bulgarian pediatric patients. Therefore, diagnostics and treatment of the infection as well as a proper control of the eradication success can be beneficial and thus, can be recommended for children with those conditions.",

    "abstract": "The vomeronasal organ (VNO) is the receptor structure of the vomeronasal system (VNS) in vertebrates. It is found bilaterally in the submucosa of the inferior part of the nasal septum. There are ongoing controversies regarding the functionality of this organ in humans. In this study we propose the immunohistochemical evaluation of changes in components of the human vomeronasal epithelium during foetal development. We used 45 foetuses of different age, which were included in three age groups. After VNO identification immunohistochemical reactions were performed using primary antibodies against the following: neuron specific enolase, calretinin, neurofilament, chromogranin, synaptophysin, cytokeratin 7, pan-cytokeratin and S100 protein. Digital slides were obtained and following colorimetric segmentation, surface area measurements were performed. The VNO was found in less than half of the studied specimens (42.2%). Neuron specific enolase and calretinin immunoexpression showed a decreasing trend with foetal age, while the other neural/neuroendocrine markers were negative in all specimens. Cytokeratin 7 expression increased with age, while Pan-Ctk had no significant variations. S100 protein immunoexpression also decreased around the VNO. The results of the present work uphold the theory of regression of the neuroepithelium that is present during initial stages of foetal development.",

    "abstract": "We have investigated the humoral immune response to antigens of predominant gut aerobic bacterial strains (i.e. Escherichia coli ) over the course of adjuvant arthritis and oil-induced arthritis in two inbred rat strains: Dark Agouti (DA) and Albino Oxford (AO). We report the presence of antibodies specific to proteins of E. coli in molecular weight range between 20–30 kDa in sera of diseased DA rats, and the absence of these antibodies in the sera of AO rats. In DA rats, CFA and IFA provoked a stronger antibody response to E. coli , especially of the IgG2b antibody class. Intramuscular administration of E. coli preceding the adjuvant arthritis induction had no effect on the development and course of disease, as well as on the activation of T cells in the draining inguinal lymph nodes. Higher serum levels of natural and induced IgA antibodies, combined with a higher CD3 + CD26 + cell percentage were found in AO rats. The observed correlation between the serologic response to commensal flora and rats’ genetic background as a defining factor for arthritis susceptibility may contribute to the process of creating a favorable (or less favorable) milieu for arthritis development.",

In Penicillium and Aspergillus filamentous fungi, which showed different characteristics in submerged cultures, the growth and biomass decline rates were calculated and correlated to the chitinase and N-acetyl- β -D-glucosaminidase enzyme productions. Correlation was found between the biomass decrease rate and the chitinase level at the stationary growth phase; while chitinase production covariates negatively with N-acetyl- β -D-glucosaminidase activities. The chitinase production and the intensive autolysis hindered the production of N-acetyl- β -D-glucosaminidase and, therefore, could hinder the cell death in the cultures.",

Three strains of CRRP (named WF0027, WF3597 and WF3648) were collected for clinical analysis and susceptibility of antimicrobial agents was determined. The WGS of three strains was done by Illumina platform and strain identification was performed by average nucleotide identity, and the antibiotic resistance genes carried by the three strains were detected by ABRicate software. Whole genome data of 46 CRRP strains were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, and the evolutionary tree was constructed by genomic single nucleotide polymorphism together with this study strains. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that WF3597 and WF3648 were susceptible to tigecycline and colistin, while exhibited resistance to 24 antimicrobial agents. WF0027 was resistant to 18 antimicrobial agents. A total of 25 resistance genes were identified using ABRicate software. WF0027 carried blaIMP-8, whereas WF3597 and WF3648 carried blaNDM-1 carbapenem resistance gene. As predicted by the PlasmidFinder, WF3597 and WF3648 carried one plasmid IncFII(p14)_1_p14, whereas WF0027 carried five plasmids. Evolutionary tree results show all strains are clustered into six groups, the strains WF3597 and WF3648 belonged to the same evolutionary group (E clade) and WF0027 belonged to the F clade. Three CRRP strains in our study carried carbapenem resistance genes (blaNDM-1 or blaIMP-8) and were resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents, posing a significant challenge for clinical treatment.",

Based on the molecular data obtained so far several changes have been introduced in the classification of yeasts, however, substantial restructuring of current taxonomic schemes with the consequence of numerous nomenclatural changes must await further studies.",

Dominance of C. albicans has been persistent, but a slight increase of C. glabrata and C. krusei could be observed. Distribution of different Candida species isolated from 16 body sites indicates that C. albicans seems to be still the most aggressive Candida species. Investigation of 244 urinary Candida isolates (parallel with bacterial cultures) suggests that tha aetiological role of Candida species in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infections can be hypothesized if colony forming unit (CFU) number of yeasts is higher than 10 4 /ml and bacteria are present in low CFU number or are absent. Antifungal susceptibility testing of C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis and C. krusei against Flucytosine, Amphotericin-B, Miconazole, Ketoconazole and Fluconazole suggests that Amphotericin-B is still the most effective antifungal agent. Finally, the problems in judging the aetiological role of isolated Candida species in the pathogenesis of different types of diseases are critically discussed.",

The endopeptidase encoded by adenoviruses (AVP or adenain) appears to be involved in several of these functions. Most of the literature concerns the protease of human adenovirus type 2, but there are good reasons to believe that the proteases of other adenovirus serotypes will be very similar.

    "abstract": "One of the greatest health-care challenges in the elderly is to ensure that vaccination against infections are optimally effective, but vaccination can only be effective if cells that are capable of responding are still present in the repertoire. The reversing of immunosenescence could be achieved by improving immune responses or altering vaccine formulation. Recent vaccination strategies in the elderly exert low effectiveness. Nutritional interventions and moderate exercise delay T cell senescence. Telomerase activity and expression of toll-like receptors can be improved by chemotherapy. Reversion of thymic atrophy could be achieved by thymus transplantation, depletion of accumulated dysfunctional naive T cells and herpesvirus-specific exhausted memory cells. Administration of immunostimulatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines show the best practical approach. Reduced dendritic cell activity and co-receptor expression might be increased by interleukin (IL)-2 administration. IL-7 protects both B and T lymphocytes, but IL-2, IL-10, keratinocyte growth factor, thymic stromal lymphopoietin, as well as leptin and growth hormone also have a stimulatory effect on thymopoiesis. In animals, several strategies have been explored to produce more efficacious vaccines including high dose vaccines, DNA vaccines with immunostimulatory patch, virosomal vaccines and vaccines containing new adjuvants. Hopefully, one of these approaches will be translated into human therapy in a short time.",

This research is aimed to perform phenotypic detection of β-lactamases and molecular characterization of NDM-1 positive K. pneumoniae isolates. Another objective is to investigate NDM-1 producing K. pneumoniae among children in Iran. From 2019 to 2020, altogether 60 K. pneumoniae isolates were acquired from various patients in certain Iranian hospitals. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by disk diffusion and broth microdilution methods. In addition, mCIM and eCIM were used to confirm the production of carbapenemases and metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs), respectively. Detection of resistance genes namely, bla NDM-1 , bla IMP , bla VIM , bla KPC , bla OXA-48-like , bla CTX-M , bla SHV , bla TEM , and mcr-1 was performed by PCR and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was employed to determine the molecular typing of the strains. According to the findings, the highest rate of carbapenem resistance was detected against doripenem 83.3% (50). Moreover, 31.7% (19) were resistant to colistin. Further to the above, altogether 80% (48) were carbapenemase-producing isolates and among them 46.7% (28) of the isolates were MBL and 33.3% (20) isolates were serine β-lactamase producer. According to the PCR results, 14 isolates produced bla NDM-1 . Remarkably, four bla NDM-1 positive isolates were detected in children. In addition, these isolates were clonally related as determined by MLST (ST147, ST15). Altogether ten bla NDM-1 positive isolates were ST147 and four bla NDM-1 positive isolates were ST15. Based on the results, the emergence of NDM-producing K. pneumoniae among children is worrying and hence, it is necessary to develop a comprehensive program to control antibiotic resistance in the country.",

For a long time, only the polysaccharide vaccine was available against pneumococcal infections, but in the last decade special conjugate vaccines were developed for paediatric use. These vaccines have made a deep impact on serotype distribution all over the world, by suppressing those serotypes included in the vaccines, while new, previously rare types emerged. These changes have been monitored closely in numerous publications all over the world. Nevertheless, data on pneumococcal serotypes in Hungary were mostly published in Hungarian, therefore not available in the international literature. In this meta-analysis, our aim was to collect and summarise all available data, and try to follow the changes observed after the introduction of the conjugate vaccines.",

A reverse route of transmission of RVA under natural circumstances is anticipated, although evidence is scarce. However, experimental studies indicated that animals can be infected with human RVAs. By screening the stool samples collected from 157 cattle during 2011 in two Cameroonian villages, four samples (2.5%) were found positive for RVA. Upon sequence analysis of a 410 bp fragment of the VP7 gene, the RVA strains shared up to 100% nt identity to each other and to G12 RVAs identified in human patients living in the same geographic regions. This finding provides evidence for a human-to-animal transmission of an epidemic human rotavirus strain.",

These sequences were classified by the formerly used genogroupgenotype system as well as by the newly accepted species classification by aligning with the corresponding region of the type sequences of the 29 TTV species. All sequences obtained during the study clustered together with the TTV1 type sequence; to express diversity within TTV1, genotypes and subtypes of the former classification were used.The commonest subtypes were 2c followed by 2b, 1a and 1b. Subtypes 2b and 2c were evenly distributed among cervical samples; subtype 1a was more frequent in patients with cervical atypia or cancer. Subtypes 2c was more frequent than 2b in head and neck lesions. In conclusion, genotype and even subtype distribution may be important in association with diseases, therefore using this classification for characterization of intraspecies diversity of TTV1 is proposed.",

Because these bacteria propagate intracellularly, the cellular immune response is an important factor in UTIs. Therefore, we designed a genetic construct to induce a cellular immune response. In order to develop a genetic construct that induces strong cellular immunity against this pathogen, we used the fimH synthetic gene according to mammalian codon usage, and the gene expression was compared with wild type codon usage. Initially, we designed two constructs, pVAX/ fimH mam and pVAX/ fimH wt, which contain mammalian and wild type codon usage, respectively. The Cos-7 cell line was transfected separately with a complex of pVAX/ fimH mam-ExGene 500 poly cationic polymer and pVAX/ fimH wt-ExGene 500 poly cationic polymer. Expression of the fimH gene in both constructs in COS7 cells was confirmed by RT-PCR, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting. Both of the pVAX/ fimH cassettes expressed inserted fimH genes (mam and wt) in Cos-7 cells. Our results suggest that codon optimization successfully expressed the fimH gene because the fimH gene with mammalian codon usage is compatible with the eukaryotic expression system. Therefore, mammalian codon usage could be appropriate in a pVAX/ fimH construct as a DNA vaccine.",

Fifty-two sera of 45 patients with mild clinical symptoms (fever, exanthema) were tested for anti-WNV antibodies in 2008 in a retrospective study by immunofluorescence test and ELISA. Seven patients had antibodies against WNV, serologic evidence of recent WNV infection was found in 4 out of the 7 patients. Infections could be acquired predominantly in August and in September, which seems to be a risk period for WNV in Hungary.The possibility of a recent WNV infection should be taken into consideration in the occurrence of fever and rush at late summer. Differential diagnosis of exanthematous patients should include WNV serology tests and should be done routinely.",

This study aimed to determine the frequency of β-lactamase genes and antibiotic resistance rates of 140 extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli isolates obtained from urinary tract infection in Ordu Province, Turkey. Isolates were identified by classic methods and by automated system. ESBL production was confirmed by double disk synergy test and antimicrobial susceptibility was investigated by disk diffusion method. All isolates were screened for β-lactamase coding genes from three groups (A, B, and D) by polymerase chain reaction.

The TTD values, however exhibited a significant increase in the 0.2–1.6 mg/kg doxycycline concentration range compared to the untreated samples indicating concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on microbial activity. The potency of the effect was different in the 3 soil types. To describe the combined effect of the doxycycline concentration and time on the biological activity of one type of soil a mathematical model was constructed and applied.The change of microbial metabolic rate could be measured also without (detectable) change of microbial count when the traditional microbiological methods are not applicable. The applied new redox potential measurement-based method is a simple and useful procedure for the examination of microbial activity of soil and its potential inhibition by antibiotics.",

High sensitivity of F. verticillioides strains was also detectable to an azole drug, Ketoconazole. Surprisingly, no or limited differences were observed in response to other oxidative, osmotic and cell wall stressors. These results indicate that fungal oxidative stress response and especially the response to hydrogen peroxide (this compound is involved in a wide range of plant-fungus interactions) might be modified on niche-specific manner in these phylogenetically related Fusarium species depending on their pathogenic strategy.

Species distribution is changing; an increase in the percentage of non-albicans species, mainly fluconazole non-susceptible C. glabrata was reported. Existing microbiology diagnostic methods lack sensitivity, and new methods need to be developed or further evaluation for routine application is necessary. Although reliable, standardized methods for antifungal susceptibility testing are available, the determination of clinical breakpoints remains challenging. Correct species identification is important and provides information on the intrinsic susceptibility profile of the isolate. Currently, acquired resistance in clinical Candida isolates is rare, but reports indicate that it could be an issue in the future. The role of the clinical microbiology laboratory is to isolate and correctly identify the infective agent and provide relevant and reliable susceptibility data as soon as possible to guide antifungal therapy.",

Because of the suspicion of optic neuritis (multiplex sclerosis) neurological examination was ordered. Surprisingly, computer tomography of the brain revealed incomplete empty sella, which generally results not monocular, but bilateral optic nerve swelling. Opthalmological examination (ophthalmoscopy and optical coherence tomography) indicated not only monocular optic nerve, but retinal oedema next to the temporal part of the right optic disk. Visual evoked potentials (VEP) demonstrated no P100 latency delay and mild differences between the amplitudes of the responses of the left and right eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) demonstrated the swelling of the optic nerve head and oedematous retina at the temporal part of the disk. Suspicion of an inflammatory cause of visual disturbance blood tests was ordered. Doxycycline treatment was ordered till the result of the blood test arrived. The Western blot and ELISA test were positive for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. Following one week corticosteroide and ceftriaxone treatments, the patient displayed a clinical improvement. Unilateral neuroretinitis with optic disk swelling due to neuroborreliosis is a rare complication and in many cases it is difficult to distinguish between inflammatory and ischemic lesions. Further difficulty in the diagnosis can occur when intracranial alterations such as empty sella is demonstrated by CT examination.",

The entomopathogenic activity of Bt is related to the existence of the crystal consisting of protoxins, also called delta-endotoxins. In order to optimize and explain the production of delta-endotoxins of Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki , we studied seven medium components: soybean meal, starch, KH 2 PO 4 , K 2 HPO 4 , FeSO 4 , MnSO 4 , and MgSO 4 and their relationships with the concentration of delta-endotoxins using an experimental design (Plackett—Burman design) and Bayesian networks modelling. The effects of the ingredients of the culture medium on delta-endotoxins production were estimated. The developed model showed that different medium components are important for the Bacillus thuringiensis fermentation. The most important factors influenced the production of delta-endotoxins are FeSO 4 , K 2 HPO 4 , starch and soybean meal. Indeed, it was found that soybean meal, K 2 HPO 4 , KH 2 PO 4 and starch also showed positive effect on the delta-endotoxins production. However, FeSO 4 and MnSO 4 expressed opposite effect. The developed model, based on Bayesian techniques, can automatically learn emerging models in data to serve in the prediction of delta-endotoxins concentrations. The constructed model in the present study implies that experimental design (Plackett—Burman design) joined with Bayesian networks method could be used for identification of effect variables on delta-endotoxins variation.",

    "abstract": "Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is the leading cause of significant economic losses in the intensive beef industry worldwide. Beside numerous risk factors Pasteurella multocida , which is regarded as a secondary pathogen, may play a role in the development of the disease. Previous studies of strains from swine pneumonia revealed that there are a few clones associated with clinical disease, suggesting that some strains may be more virulent than others. This linkage may be true in the BRD, however composition of P. multocida populations in the herds are slightly characterized. Thus, we decided to perform phenotypic and genotypic characterisation of strains isolated from calves with respiratory infection at 31 different herds in Hungary. The results demonstrated the presence of two dominant strain types. At the identical taxonomic background ( P. multocida subsp. multocida ) with slight phenotypic variability they could be separated by trehalose fermentation capacity, α-glucosidase activity and molecular fingerprint patterns of ERIC- and M13-PCR. Independent prevalence and geographical origin of the strain types may refer to their significance in the illness, but their comparison with strains isolated from healthy individuals is taken into consideration.",

During GAS certain organs show typical reactions and two members of the hormonal system are activated: epinephine and glucocorticoids. As the unicellular ciliate Tetrahymena also synthesize most of the mammalian-like hormones (except steroids), it can respond to stress by a hormonal reaction. The main differences, related to the mammalian GAS hormonal reaction are, that 1) in Tetrahymena the level of all of the hormones studied significantly elevates under the effect of heat, osmotic or chemical stress and 2) the single stress effect is durable. It is manifested at least to the 100th generations, which means that it is inherited epigenetically. Not only hormone synthesis but the receptorial hormone binding is also elevated, which means that the whole hormonal system is activated. The stress reaction (GAS) phylogenetically can be deduced to a unicellular (Protozoan) level however, prokaryotes — which are also stress-reactive — are using another mechanisms.",

This is provided by means of different biological processes including the regulation of apoptosis of naive T-cells. One of the potential regulators of apoptosis of T-lymphocytes is a death receptor 3 (DR3). We have studied the role of DR3 in the regulation of apoptosis of naive CD4+ (nTh) and CD8+ (nCTL) T-cells in healthy children and children with AIM. In healthy children as well as in children with AIM, the activation of DR3 is accompanied by inhibition of apoptosis of nTh. In healthy children, the stimulation of DR3 resulted in the increase in apoptosis of nCTL. On the contrary, in children with AIM, the level of apoptosis of nCTL decreased after DR3 activation, which is a positive contribution to the antiviral immune response. In children with AIM, nCTL are characterized by reduced level of apoptosis as compared with healthy children. These results indicate that DR3 can be involved in the reduction of sensitivity of nCTL to apoptosis in children with AIM.",

AK is a corneal disease that is predominantly associated with contact lens use, the epidemiology of which is related to the specific genotype of Acanthamoeba . This study reports seven (7/16; 43.75%) positive cases. Detection of Acanthamoeba in corneal scrapings is based on cultivation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined with the molecular taxonomic identification method. By PCR, seven samples were positive; cultivation was successful for five samples, probably because of the low quantity of samples. Genotype identification was carried out with a real-time fluorescence resonance energy transfer PCR assay based on sequence analysis of the 18S rRNA gene, and sensitivity and specificity were evaluated in comparison with traditional parasitological techniques. All seven detected Acanthamoeba strains belonged to the T4 genotype, the main AK-related genotype worldwide. These results confirmed the importance of a complete diagnostic protocol, including a PCR assay, for the clinical diagnosis of AK from human samples. Genotyping allowed the identification of all isolates in the T4 group, thus demonstrating the prevalence of this genotype in Hungary.",

Overall 158 family physicians took part in the study from six European countries. Results: Family doctors’ most important experience was that the official campaign was not able to compensate negative effects of the mass media. Due to the poor evidence-based information about new vaccines, it was difficult to convince the public and some health care professionals too. Lack of unified directives – under unclear circumstances – made the routine patient care more difficult and hampered the collaboration between different health care providers.

The objectives of this study were to describe R. pickettii bacteremia in a cardiac surgery patient and to evaluate its ability to grow in a saline solution and to form biofilm. The patient in this study underwent mitral and aortic valve replacement surgery with two aortocoronary bypasses. She developed signs of respiratory and renal failure, therefore hemodialysis was started. After 25 days in an intensive care unit, the patient had recurrent episodes of fever with signs of bacteremia. R. pickettii was identified from blood cultures by MALDI-TOF MS. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using disc diffusion and broth microdilution methods in accordance with EUCAST methodology and results were interpreted following clinical breakpoints for Pseudomonas spp. The isolate was susceptible to all tested antimicrobial agents except aminoglycosides and colistin. Survival of R. pickettii was analyzed in saline solution with four different starting concentrations at 25 °C and 37 °C for six days. Biofilm capacity was tested using the microtiter plate method. R. pickettii showed substantial growth in saline solution, with starting concentration of 2 CFU ml −1 reaching 10 7 CFU ml −1 after six days. There was no significant difference between growth at 25 °C and 37 °C. This indicates that storage of contaminated solutions at room temperature can enhance the count of R. pickettii . Our strain did not show the capacity to form biofilm. The patient responded well to adequate treatment with ceftazidime, and after 48 days in ICU she was discharged to convalesce.",

This study aimed to determine the susceptibility profile of extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)- producing uropathogens to selected antibiotics and their carriage of ESBL genes. Bacterial uropathogens were obtained from the urine bench of a Microbiology laboratory in a Teaching Hospital in South-West Nigeria. Susceptibility to antibiotics was tested using the disc diffusion method, while detection of ESBL production was done using the double disc synergy test (DDST). Detection of ESBL genes was performed by PCR. A total of 21 ESBL- producing uropathogens were obtained namely: Klebsiella pneumoniae (11), Klebsiella oxytoca (6), Proteus mirabilis (2), Enterobacter cloacae (1) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1). The resistance to antibiotics in the uropathogens was: imipenem (0%), gentamicin (38.1%), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (52.4%), amoxicillin-clavulanate (61.9%), aztreonam (66.7%), ceftazidime (66.7%), tetracycline (90.5%), cefpodoxime (100%) and cefotaxime (100%). Altogether, 90.5% (19/21) of the isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR).

There was co-carriage of ESBL genes in 12 uropathogens. This study showed a high prevalence of multidrug resistance and a high carriage of ESBL genes in the ESBL- producing isolates obtained over the study period. There is a need for a review of antibiotic options in the treatment of UTI to clamp down on the ever-increasing tide of antibiotic resistance in uropathogens.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to compare vaccinated and unvaccinated patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in terms of disease severity, need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death. In addition, we determined the factors affecting the COVID-19 severity in vaccinated patients. Patients aged 18-65 years who were hospitalized for COVID-19 between September and December 2021 were retrospectively analyzed in three groups: unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, and fully vaccinated.A total of 854 patients were included. Mean age was 47.9 ± 10.6 years, 474 patients (55.5%) were male. Of these, 230 patients (26.9%) were fully vaccinated, 97 (11.3%) were partially vaccinated, and 527 (61.7%) were unvaccinated. Of the fully vaccinated patients, 67% (n = 153) were vaccinated with CoronaVac and 33% (n = 77) were vaccinated with Pfizer-BioNTech. All patients (n = 97) with a single dose were vaccinated with Pfizer-BioNTech. One hundred thirteen (13.2%) patients were transferred to ICU. A hundred (11.7%) patients were intubated and 77 (9.0%) patients died. Advanced age (P = 0.028, 95% CI = 1.00-1.07, OR = 1.038) and higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) (P < 0.001, 95% CI = 1.20-1.69, OR = 1.425) were associated with increased mortality, while being fully vaccinated (P = 0.008, 95% CI = 0.23-0.80, OR = 0.435) was associated with survival in multivariate analysis. Full dose vaccination reduced the need for ICU admission by 49.7% (95% CI = 17-70) and mortality by 56.5% (95% CI = 20-77). When the fully vaccinated group was evaluated, we found that death was observed more frequent in patients with CCI>3 (19.1 vs 5.8%, P < 0.01, OR = 3.7). Therefore, the booster vaccine especially in individuals with comorbidities should not be delayed, since the survival expectation is low in patients with a high comorbidity index.",

Samples were collected from three university hospitals in Sanandaj, Iran, from December 2016 to March 2018. Antibiotic susceptibility testing, phenotypic and genotypic detection of carbapenemases were performed. Common K. pneumoniae capsular types were sought for all isolates. The genetic relatedness of isolates was investigated by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Plasmids were detected by PCR-based Replicon Typing (PBRT). During the study, 67 K. pneumoniae isolates were identified. Of which, 18 (26.9%) isolates were detected as carbapenem-resistant. The most effective antibacterial agent was tigecycline (97%, 65 isolates) followed by imipenem and ertapenem (73.13%, 49 isolates). PCR showed that 13 isolates (19.4%) had blaNDM-1 gene and 5 (7.5%) harbored blaOXA-48. Examination of common capsular types showed that 2 isolates had K2 and 2 others had K54. REP-PCR revealed 10 clones and 11 singleton strains. MLST analysis of CRKP found ST15 as the most common type (13 isolates, 72.2%), but other STs were also detected namely, ST19, ST117, ST1390, and ST1594. ColE1 and IncL/M plasmids were the carriers of blaNDM-1 and blaOXA-48, respectively. The results showed that CRKP spread in our health centers. Our results, therefore, indicate a worrying trend of resistance to carbapenems in K. pneumoniae.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the major infectious agents in burn patients. Globally, high rates of antimicrobial resistance in P. aeruginosa have been reported, which is a cause of concern. The objective of this study was to determine the rate of resistance to carbapenems in P. aeruginosa isolates recovered from burn patients in Tunisia, to search genes encoding for carbapenemases and to determine their epidemiological markers (serotypes). A retrospective study was conducted in the Burn Intensive Care Unit (BICU) of the Trauma and Burn Centre of Ben Arous, Tunisia, and P. aeruginosa isolates collected from burn patients, from January to December 2018 were investigated. Carbapenemase screening was performed by Carbapenem Inactivation Method (CIM) and by EDTA-disk test for all carbapenem resistant isolates. Genes encoding carbapenemases ( bla VIM , bla IMP , bla GES , bla NDM , and bla KPC ) were investigated by PCR and selected carbapenemase genes were sequenced. During the study period, 104 non duplicated P. aeruginosa isolates were recovered. Most of them were isolated from skin samples (45.1%) and blood culture (22.1%) and belonged to O:11 (19.2%), O:12, and O:5 (12.5%, each) serotypes. High rates of resistance were observed for carbapenems (64.4%). Among the 67 carbapenem resistant isolates, 58 (86.5%) harbored bla VIM gene and 55 (82%) bla GES gene; in addition, 48 (71.6%) co-harbored bla VIM and bla GES genes. After sequencing, the bla VIM-2 and bla GES-5 gene variants were identified in seven randomly selected isolates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of P. aeruginosa simultaneously harboring bla VIM-2 and bla GES-5 genes.",

    "abstract": "Irreversible pulpitis is an inflammation of the tooth pulp caused by an opportunity-driven invasion of the pulp space by oral microbiota typically prevalent in the oral cavity. Microbial organisms are extensively recognised to be the fundamental cause of endodontic infections and treatment failures. Previously, bacterial species responsible for these infections were largely recognised using conventional microbial culture techniques, lending credence to the widely held belief that anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria frequently enter the pulp space and trigger endodontic infections. The advent of novel technologies grants the advantage of detecting and studying microbial populations via an amalgamation of the modern \"Omics\" techniques and meticulous bioinformatics analysis, additionally detecting the metatranscriptome, metaproteome and metabolome along with the metagenome. Amongst these analytical strategies, metagenomic analyses are essentially pragmatic for investigating the oral microbiome. Metagenomics favor not only assessment of microbial composition in diseased conditions, but also contributes to detection of novel, potentially pathogenic species inclusive of non-viable bacteria. The present review describes current knowledge of root canal microbiome, including its composition and functional attributes, the novel strategies available for detection of microbiome as well as challenges associated and provides some crucial pointers for areas of future research.",

Latent viral genomes may also be affected by DNA methylation in their host cells. We calculated, therefore, frequencies of dinucleotides in 20 completely sequenced herpesvirus genomes. We found a relative deficiency of CpG dinucleotides and a surplus of TpG + CpA dinucleotides in all lymphotropic gammaherpesvirus genomes except for two strains of rhesus rhadinovirus. DNAs of two strains of human herpesvirus 7, a betaherpesvirus targeting helper T cells, and equine herpesvirus 4, an alphaherpesvirus residing in the lymphoreticular system, also had a moderate CpG deficiency and TpG + CpA surplus. In contrast, most members of Alpha-, and Betaherpesvirinae subfamilies contained a relative surplus of CpG dinucleotides in their DNAs. Our data are consistent with the idea that methylated latent genomes are involved, after reactivation and productive replication, in the natural transmission cycle of most members of Gammaherpesvirinae and certain lymphotropic members of Alpha- and Betaherpesvirinae.",

The worldwide spread of HIV has soon been recognized and AIDS has become one of the most alarming infectious diseases of our days. Its impact has been tremendous, high morbidity and mortality has caused a reversal of socioeconomic gains previously recorded in several developing countries, especially those in Sub-Saharan Africa [2]. Epidemiological data about the HIV and AIDS pandemic are updated by the Joint United Nation Programme on HIV/AIDS, UNAIDS (http://www.unaids.org). Their latest report from December 2000 states that in year 2000 approximately 5.3 million people have become newly infected with HIV, of which 2.2 were women and 600 000 children younger than 15 years of age. The estimated number of people living with HIV/AIDS globally is 36.1 million, of which 16.4 million are women and 1.4 million are children younger than 15 years of age. Approximately 25.3 million (70%) of these HIV infected people live in Sub-Saharan Africa, 5.8 million in South- and South-East Asia (15%), and 1.4 million in Latin-America (5%). During year 2000, 3 million people died of AIDS (1.3 million women and 500 000 children younger than 15 years of age). This means that an estimated total of 21.8 million persons have died of AIDS since the beginning of the epidemic, including 4.3 million children younger than 15 years of age.",

Ninety-six samples were examined from patients with CRS. In 74 cases mucus was collected non-invasively, and in 22 cases during operation. The Gram-stained direct smears of all samples were also evaluated. Bacteria and fungi colonizing in the mucus were detected by culturing method. The control group consisted of 50 healthy volunteers. Typical aerobic pathogenic bacteria could be isolated from 34 patients. Fifty-seven aerobic bacteria were isolated, i.e. 1.6 bacteria/positive patient with a maximum of 3 different bacteria/sample. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae , and Haemophilus influenzae . Yeasts and moulds could be detected from 79 patients (83%): Candida albicans, Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., Cladosporium spp, and Penicillium spp. were isolated most frequently. Altogether 237 yeasts and moulds were isolated, i.e. 3.0 different fungi/positive patient, with a maximum of 5 different fungi/sample. In the control group aerobic pathogens were not isolated, only apathogenic species. Fungi were isolated from 22 healthy patients (44%). These data indicate that fungi are frequently involved in the aetiology of CRS. IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to fungal allergens could not be proven in our patients.",

Therefore, EBV-induced malignancies occur only when the immune response is impaired, e.g. in transplant recipients. The versatility of the viral gene expression strategy secures the consistent maintainance of the virus in healthy individuals. The viral proteins required for transformation render the cell immunogenic. Expression of the transforming genes leads to rejection, but these genes are not required for the maintenance of the viral genome. EBV is an important contributor for malignant transformation, even when it does not directly induce cell proliferation. Several mechanisms have been unravelled in EBV-associated tumors whereby the virus may modify the cellular phenotype and may influence the interaction of tumor cells with their microenvironment. The virus carrier state can lead to the evasion of apoptosis and can intensify the response to growth promoting signals, too.",

We have characterized three virulence genes and correlated their presence with the severity of infection and in vitro invasiveness. We studied eight C. jejuni strains isolated from patients whose clinical data were scored to determine severity of infection. Cytolethal distending toxin (cdtB) , invasion associated marker (iam) and Campylobacter invasion antigen (ciaB) genes were detected by PCR and INT407 cells used for invasion assays. Two strains positive for all three genes were the most invasive and isolated from patients with the most severe infection. Four strains positive for two genes and two strains negative for all the three genes were identified. The two cdtB + ve / ciaB + ve strains were more invasive than the cdtB + ve / iam + ve strains. One of the cdtB − ve / ciaB − ve strains showed invasion levels similar to cdtB + ve / ciaB + ve strains, but the second strain had a non-invasive phenotype. The findings indicate a correlation between in vitro invasive capability, and the presence of all three genes. The pattern of association between invasiveness and molecular characterization suggests that the ciaB gene confers a more invasive capability.",

Two clone libraries were constructed from H3M and H4M samples, providing 288 and 192 clones which were grouped to 150 and 125 OTUs, respectively, by ARDRA. The two most abundant group of the H4M library were OP8-related. The phylum Proteobacteria was represented mostly by δ -Proteobacteria, other relevant groups were Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria and β -Proteobacteria. The H3M library was dominated by Cyanobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, β -Proteobacteria, γ -Proteobacteria and δ -Proteobacteria. Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, Spirochetes and Firmicutes were scarce. Results from the clone libraries were compared to the length-heterogeneity-PCR fingerprints of the communities.",

    "abstract": "Complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIaIs) respresent a serious cause of morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis and well-timed treatment can improve patients’ outcome, whereas the delay in management often result in rapid progression to circulatory collapse, multiple organ failure, and death. Neutrophil CD64 antigen expression has been studied for several years as infectious and sepsis biomarker and has several characteristics that make it good for clinical employment. It has been suggested to be predictive of positive bacterial cultures and a useful test for management of sepsis and other significant bacterial infections. Our review concluded that the neutrophil CD64 expression could be a promising and meaningful biomarker in patients with cIaIs. It shows good potential for evaluating the severity of the disease and could give information about the outcome. However, more large studies should be performed before using it in clinical practice.",

A pET100/D-TOPO + bla NDM-1 was used to generate the alanine mutations at different positions, such as NDM-2 (P28A), NDM-3 (D95A), NDM-4 (M154A), NDM-5 (V88A), NDM-7 (D130A), and NDM-9 (E152A). The mutant variants were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α. Changes in the activities of alanine mutation variants were determined by E-test. All samples had 32 μg/ml MIC values against ampicillin. The 28 th amino acid mutation sample had the highest MIC value against ceftazidime, whereas decreased MIC value for piperacillin. It was observed that the resistance to imipenem was increased in mutant variants D95A, M154A, D130A, and E152A, comparing with P28A and V88A.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of 16S rRNA methylases among Enterobacter cloacae strains isolated from an Ahvaz teaching hospital, Iran. A total of 68 E. cloacae clinical strains were collected between November 2017 and September 2018. The MICs of aminoglycosides were assessed using the agar dilution method. The presence of 16S rRNA methylase genes, including armA, rmtA to rmtH , and nmpA was evaluated by PCR. The transferability of 16S rRNA methylase-harboring plasmids was evaluated by conjugation assay. The genetic diversity of all isolates was evaluated by ERIC-PCR. The armA and rmtB genes were the only 16S rRNA methylase genes detected in this study (29 out of 68 isolates; 42.64%). The transferability by conjugation was observed in 23 rmtB or/and armA positive donors. HLAR phenotype was in 33 of 68 strains. Ten clonal types were obtained by ERIC-PCR and significant associations ( p &lt; 0.05) were between the clone types and aminoglycoside susceptibility, as well as with profile of the 16S rRNA methylase genes. In conclusion, both horizontal transfer and clonal spread are responsible for dissemination of the rmtB and armA genes among E. cloacae strains.",

This study determined the diversity and antibiotic resistance gene profile of Salmonella enterica serovars isolated from humans and food animals. Using standard methods, Salmonella spp. were isolated from fecal samples, profiled for antimicrobial susceptibility and resistance genes. Seventy-one Salmonella isolates were recovered from both humans and food animals comprising cattle, sheep, and chicken. Forty-four serovars were identified, with dominant Salmonella Budapest (31.8%). Rare serovars were present in chicken ( S . Alfort, S . Wichita, S . Linton, S . Ealing, and S . Ebrie) and humans ( S . Mowanjum, S . Huettwillen, S . Limete, and S . Chagoua). Sixty-eight percent of isolates were sensitive to all test antibiotics, while the highest rate of resistance was to nalidixic acid (16.9%; n = 12), followed by ciprofloxacin (11.3%; n = 8) and tetracycline (9.9%; n = 8). Five isolates (7%) were multidrug-resistant and antimicrobial resistance genes coding resistance to tetracycline ( tetA ), beta-lactam ( bla TEM ), and quinolone/fluoroquinolone ( qnrB and qnrS ) were detected. Evolutionary analysis of gyrA gene sequences of human and food animal Salmonella isolates revealed variations but are evolutionarily interconnected. Isolates were grouped into four clades with S . Budapest isolate from cattle clustering with S . Budapest isolated from chicken, whereas S . Essen isolated from sheep and chicken was grouped into a clade. Diverse S. enterica serovars with high antibiotic resistance profile are ubiquitous in food animals; hence, there is a need for surveillance and prudent use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine.",

    "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori is the most common cause of chronic infection in human and is associated with gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and adenocarcinoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue cells. Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) is a synthetic compound, which can inhibit the production of a particular gene. This study aimed to investigate the effect of PNA on inhibiting the expression of cagA. After confirmation of the desired gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the antisense sequence was designed against cagA gene. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of conjugated PNA against H. pylori was determined. The effect of the compound on the expression level of the cagA was investigated in HT29 cell culture using real-time PCR. The results showed 2 and 3 log reduction in bacterial count after 8- and 24-h treatment with 4 and 8 μM of the compound, respectively. The lowest expression level of the cagA gene was observed at a concentration of 8 μM after 6 h. The results of this study showed that cell-penetrating peptide antisense can be employed as effective tools for inhibiting the target gene mRNA for various purposes. Moreover, further research is necessary to assess the potency, safety, and pharmacokinetics of CPP-PNAs for clinical prevention and treatment of infections due to H. pylori.",

The goal of our study was to identify urinary pathogens directly by MALDI-TOF MS and to perform antibiotic susceptibility tests in order to shorten the period spent for culturing. Urine samples submitted for culture to the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory were enrolled in this study. Urine samples were screened for leukocyte and bacteria amount by flow cytometry. Samples with bacterial load of 10 6 –10 7 /mL were tested directly by MALDI-TOF MS and antibiotic susceptibility tests (AST) were performed. In total, 538 positive urine samples were evaluated in our study. MALDI-TOF MS identified the microorganism directly from the urine sample in 91.8% of these samples and the concordance rate of conventional identification and direct detection was 95.8% for Gram-negatives at the genus and species level. Escherichia coli ( n :401) was the most frequently isolated microorganism, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae ( n :57). AST results were generated for 111 of these urine samples and the concordance was 90% and 87% for E. coli and K. pneumoniae , respectively. Our results showed that screening of urine samples with flow cytometry to detect positive samples and identification of uropathogens directly by MALDI-TOF MS with an accuracy of over 90% can be a suitable method particularly for Gram-negative bacteria in clinical microbiology laboratories.",

Carbapenem resistance genes were identified by PCR. The isolates were typed by RAPD-PCR and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) methods. All isolates were resistant to imipenem and 80 isolates to meropenem. Frequency of oxacillinase genes was as follows: blaOXA-23 gene was positive in 74 (91.3%), blaOXA-24 gene in 50 (61.7%) and blaOXA-58 was not found in any isolates. On the other hand 22 (27.2%) isolates contained blaIMP-1, 3 (3.7%) isolates contained blaIMP-2 gene, 5 (6.2%) isolates contained blaVIM-1, 4 (5%) isolates had blaVIM-2 and none of the isolates had blaSIM-1 gene. RAPD-PCR typing identified 16 different patterns, with one pattern being the most frequent one in 26 isolates. In MLST 6 different sequence types were identified, the most predominant being ST2 belonging to clonal complex 2. The results of this study showed high resistance to carbapenems as well as high abundance of oxacillinase genes.",

Neisseria meningitidis represented 58.5%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 35.5%, and Haemophilus influenzae type b 6%. H. influenzae type b mainly affected 5-year-olds and unvaccinated adults. N. meningitidis serogroup B represented 90.7% followed by serogroup W135 with 6.5%. Decreased susceptibility to penicillin G (DSPG) for all isolates accounted for 15.7%, with 11.6% being resistant to penicillin G (PG) and 4.1% decreased susceptibility. Cumulative results of all strains showed 2.7% decreased susceptibility to amoxicillin and 3.3% resistant, 2.2% of isolates were resistant to third-generation cephalosporin and 2.2% were decreased susceptible, 5.5% were resistant to chloramphenicol and 2.7% were resistant to rifampin. The frequency of DSPG observed in our study is more common in S. pneumoniae than in N. meningitidis ( P &lt; 0.05). These isolates have been found to be highly susceptible to antibiotics used for treatment and prophylaxis chemotherapy and the observed resistance remains rare. The impact of introduction of conjugate vaccines against H. influenzae type b and S. pneumoniae (PCVs) is an advantage in reducing meningitis cases due to these two species.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophages play an important role in the pathogenicity of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) either by carrying accessory virulence factors or several superantigens. Despite their importance, there are not many studies showing the actual distribution of the virulence genes carried by the prophages obtained from the clinically isolated Staphylococcus. In this study, we investigated prophages obtained from methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains isolated from hospital- and community-associated (HA-CA) infections for the virulence factors. In the study, 43 phages isolated from 48 MRSA were investigated for carrying toxin genes including the sak, eta, lukF-PV, sea, selp, sek, seg, seq chp, and scn virulence genes using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blot. Restriction fragment length polymorphism was used to analyze phage genomes to investigate the relationship between the phage profiles and the toxin genes' presence. MRSA strains isolated from HA infections tended to have higher prophage presence than the MRSA strains obtained from the CA infections (97% and 67%, respectively). The study showed that all the phages with the exception of one phage contained one or more virulence genes in their genomes with different combinations. The most common toxin genes found were sea (83%) followed by sek (77%) and seq (64%). The study indicates that prophages encode a significant proportion of MRSA virulence factors.",

Recently developed technologies and therapies, involving bone marrow or solid-organ transplants and chemotherapeutic agents, have become common at many medical centers, resulting in the emergence of many immunocompromised individuals. In intensive care units (ICU) the use of invasive monitoring devices, parenteral nutrition, broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, and assisted ventilation has helped in the treatment of patients suffering from previously devastating or fatal diseases and has provided opportunities for life to premature neonates previously thought to be non-viable [1]. However, these successes have resulted in the proliferation of a severely ill, immunocompromised, long-lasting hospitalized patient population. The AIDS epidemic has also added patients at risk to this growing population of immunocompromised individuals [2]. The immunocompromised patient is highly susceptible to nosocomial infections caused by organisms such as fungi that were previously considered to be of low virulence or „non-pathogenic” [3]. Besides the well-known endemic fungal pathogens (Histoplasma capsulatumCoccidioides immitisandBlastomyces dermatitidis), opportunisticCandidaspecies have been implicated most frequently in nosocomial fungal infections.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial secretory component (SC) is thought to be essential for immunologic protection of the respiratory tract from viral and bacterial infection, since it transports polymeric IgA from the basolateral to the luminal surface of epithelial cells. We have hypothesized that recurrent infection in airways of cigarette smokers is at least partly a consequence of cigarette smoke-induced downregulation of the expression and/or release of SC from airway epithelial cells, subsequently resulting in decreased transcytosis of secretory IgA to the airway lumen. To test this hypothesis, we have cultured human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) from surgical tissues and exposed these for 20 minutes to either air or cigarette smoke. Following exposure to cigarette smoke the HBEC cultures were incubated for a further period of up to 24 h, during which time separate cultures were processed by immunocytochemistry for the presence of SC, in a time-dependent manner. The stained HBEC cultures were evaluated by colour image analysis for the percentage of total cells staining for SC. Exposure to cigarette smoke significantly decreased the percentage of total HBEC staining for secretory component from a baseline value (median and interquartile[IQ]1, IQ3) of 35.9% (26.5, 41.6) to 15.7% (8.2, 25.4; p < 0.05) 1 h after exposure, compared with exposure to air. The percentage of cells staining for secretory component were further reduced to 5.3% (3.3, 6.4; p < 0.01), 6 h after exposure, compared to exposure to air. After incubation for 24 h following exposure to cigarette smoke, there was gross cell damage and the cells were not suitable for immunocytochemical analysis. These results suggest that short-term exposure to cigarette smoke may compromise the immune barrier function of the airway mucosa by decreasing the expression and/or release of epithelial SC, thereby decreasing the transcytosis of IgA necessary for inactivating the microbial pathogens in the airway lumen.",

Activation of DC by various stimuli induces morphological and functional changes and transforms these cells to potent antigen presenting and secretory cells. A newly identified precursor subset of human DC has recently been identified as professional type I interferon producing cells (IPC) with multiple functional activities. Interferon-producing cells, also referred as pDC act as a link between innate and adaptive immunity and possess the capacity to instruct and regulate pathogen- and tumor-specific immune responses. The role of IPC/pDC - partly mediated by type I interferons - has also been demonstrated in the pathogenesis of various diseases and could be used as a target for modulating immune responses.",

The decrease was regularly correlated with the doses of the two herbicides and persisted till the end of the experiment (12 weeks). The isolated fungi were found to be able to produce hydrolytic extracellular enzymes in solid media but with variable capabilities. The ability to produce enzymes was adversily affected by the incorporation of herbicides in culture media. Lower doses of herbicides were occasionally promotive to enzyme production and mycelial growth of some fungi. Incorporation of 50 ppm of Herbizid and Touchdown significantly activated amylase production and mycelial dry weight in cultures of Fusarium oxysporum, Mucor hiemalis and Penicillium chrysogenum. There was a significant increase in C1-cellulase produced by F. oxysporum and P. aurantiogriseum when cultures weretreated with 50, 100 and 200 ppm of Herbizid which induced also more Cx-cellulase production by P.chrysogenum.

    "abstract": "In leukemic mice, the native host's explicit and well-defined immune reactions to the leukemia virus (a strong exogenous antigen) and to leukemia cells (pretending in their native hosts to be protected \"self\" elements) are extinguished and replaced in GvHD (graft-versus-host disease) by those of the immunocompetent donor cells. In many cases, the GvHD-inducer donors display genetically encoded resistance to the leukemia virus. In human patients only antileukemia and anti-tumor cell immune reactions are mobilized; thus, patients are deprived of immune reactions to a strong exogenous antigen (the elusive human leukemia-sarcoma retroviruses). The innate and adaptive immune systems of mice have to sustain the immunosuppressive effects of leukemia-inducing retroviruses. Human patients due to the lack of leukemiainducing retroviral pathogens (if they exist, they have not as yet been discovered), escape such immunological downgrading. After studying leukemogenic retroviruses in murine and feline (and other mammalian) hosts, it is very difficult to dismiss retroviral etiology for human leukemias and sarcomas. Since no characterized and thus recognized leukemogenic-sarcomagenic retroviral agents are being isolated from the vast majority of human leukemias-sarcomas, the treatment for these conditions in mice and in human patients vastly differ. It is immunological and biological modalities (alpha interferons; vaccines; adoptive lymphocyte therapy) that dominate the treatment of murine leukemias, whereas combination chemotherapy remains the main remission-inducing agent in human leukemias-lymphomas and sarcomas (as humanized monoclonal antibodies and immunotoxins move in). Yet, in this apparently different backgrounds in Mus and Homo, GvHD, as a treatment modality, appears to work well in both hosts, by replacing the hosts' anti-leukemia and anti-tumor immune faculties with those of the donor. The clinical application of GvHD in the treatment of human leukemias-lymphomas and malignant solid tumors remains a force worthy of pursuit, refinement and strengthening. Graft engineering and modifications of the inner immunological environment of the recipient host by the activation or administration of tumor memory T cells, selected Treg cells and natural killer (NKT) cell classes and cytokines, and the improved pharmacotherapy of GvHD without reducing its antitumor efficacy, will raise the value of GvHD to the higher ranks of the effective antitumor immunotherapeutical measures. Clinical interventions of HCT/HSCT (hematopoietic cell/stem cell transplants) are now applicable to an extended spectrum of malignant diseases in human patients, being available to elderly patients, who receive non-myeloablative conditioning, are re-enforced by post-transplant donor lymphocyte (NK cell and immune T cell) infusions and post-transplant vaccinations, and the donor cells may derive from engineered grafts, or from cord blood with reduced GvHD, but increased GvL/GvT-inducing capabilities (graft-versus leukemia/tumor). Post-transplant T cell transfusions are possible only if selected leukemia antigen-specific T cell clones are available. In verbatim quotation: \"Ultimately, advances in separation of GvT from GvHD will further enhance the potential of allogeneic HCT as a curative treatment for hematological malignancies\" (Rezvani, A.R. and Storb, R.F., Journal of Autoimmunity 30:172–179, 2008 (see in the text)). It may be added: for cure, a combination of the GvL/T effects with new targeted therapeutic modalities, as elaborated on in this article, will be necessary.",

To better understand the connection between the seropositivity and the mortality rate, the key factor could be the temporal and spatial analysis of the different strains. In this study, serum samples (n = 26) were selected from CCHFV RNA-positive patients and subjected to sequence analysis of the gene regions encoding the S segments. According to the neighbor-joining analysis, the obtained partial sequences were linked to the European strain. The strains were closely related to Turkey-Kelkit06, Turkey 200310849 viruses, and viruses from Russia and Kosovo. The comparison with previously analyzed isolates from the GenBank showed 95%-99% sequence similarity. The isolates in phylogenetic branches were divided into two groups. AST, platelet, and APTT levels were found significantly higher in Group 2 compared to Group 1. Nucleotide differences can be prognostic factor in CCHF disease. Increasing CCHF cases not originating from local isolates were circulating strains imported from different neighboring countries of Turkey. The results show new evidence to the emerging threat of the CCHF disease.",

They can be imprinted by hormonal or pseudo-hormonal (environmental) factors, which could provoke pathological alterations for life (by faulty perinatal hormonal imprinting).

None of the enzymatic- and dye-based viability assays tested here generated survival rates for trophozoites/cysts that were comparable with those yielded with the non-nutrient agar E. coli plate assay, suggesting that the culture-based assay is the best method to study the treatment efficacy of drugs against Acanthamoeba.",

    "abstract": "Lake Hévíz is the largest natural warm water lake of Europe. The curative mud of the lake comprises volcanic and marsh components although their species composition is hardly known yet. The aim of the present study was to gain information about the distribution and species diversity of bacterial communities inhabiting the sediment of Lake Hévíz using cultivation-based and molecular cloning methods. Samples from two depths and locations were taken in 2004 and 2007. Representatives of the altogether 255 bacterial isolates were affiliated with the phyla Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. The most abundant groups belonged to the genus Bacillus (Firmicutes). Many of Lake Hévíz isolates showed the highest sequence similarity to bacteria known to be plant associated or members of normal human microbiota as well as participating in decomposition of highly resistant organic materials. In the three clone libraries, phylotypes belonging to altogether different phyla (Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Chlorobi, Chloroflexi, Deferribacteres, Nitrospirae, Spirochaetes and Verrucomicrobia) were revealed from which members of Gammaproteobacteria and Cyanobacteria proved to be the most abundant. Regardless of the sampling times and methodology used, high spatial heterogeneities of bacterial community structures were characteristic of the sediment of Lake Hévíz.",

Our investigations were performed on 141 poultry samples sorted from supermarkets.Relative accuracy, relative specificity and relative sensitivity were determined. According to the ISO 16140:2003 criteria for validation of alternative microbiological methods, the ELFA-based method (VIDAS ICS2 + SLM), and real-time PCR methods (TaqMan, Bax) were comparable to the reference standard method for the detection of Salmonella spp. in chicken meat. The use of these methods provide results within 48 hours with high sensitivity (100%). The TaqMan real-time PCR showed a relative specificity of 98% and both of the real-time PCR methods presented 100%.The VIDAS ICS2 + SLM and the Bax real-time PCR methods showed the highest relative accuracy (100%) and 99% in case of the TaqMan method.

    "abstract": "Adenoviruses have increasingly been recognized as significant viral pathogens causing high morbidity and mortality especially among immunocompromised individuals such as transplant recipients and AIDS patients. Through the infection process, after the adenovirus fiber and penton are bonded to cell surface receptors through special amino acid moieties, secondary messengers activate protein kinases, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Serotype and species specific antibodies also are induced. Recombinant human adenoviruses have been pivotal in the development of gene therapy strategies and have shown a great promise for the treatment of genetic disorders and malignancies. Recent studies have enlightened their harmful immunological effects dependent on fiber and hexon polypeptide structure and receptor binding. Pre-existing antibodies or those elicited by vectors neutralize input recombinant adenovirus particles rendering them ineffective. Mediators induce serious even lethal side effects and cytotoxic reactions which extinguish transgene expression. To overcome these difficulties new strategies are required in the application of recombinant adenoviruses to redirect vector entry from the natural receptors to alternative binding sites or using rare human or animal adenovirus fiber molecules to modify the native fiber structure by altering amino acid structure and creating chimeric fibers. This requires searching for, isolating and characterizing new serotypes, mutants or variants for new generation vectors. Human adenovirus 1 feline isolate (feline adenovirus) might fulfil these criteria.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine antimicrobial susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains to marbofloxacin and gentamicin, and investigate the possible synergistic, additive, indifferent or antagonistic effects between the two agents. P. aeruginosa strains can develop resistance quickly against certain antibiotics if used alone, thus the need emerges to find synergistic combinations. A total of 68 P. aeruginosa strains isolated from dogs were examined. In order to describe interactions between marbofloxacin and gentamicin the checkerboard microdilution method was utilized. The MICs (minimum inhibitory concentrations) for marbofloxacin and gentamicin were in the range 0.25–64 mg/L and 0.25–32 mg/L, respectively. The combination of marbofloxacin and gentamicin was more effective with a MIC range of 0.031–8 mg/L and a MIC 90 of 1 mg/L, compared to 16 mg/L for marbofloxacin alone and 8 mg/L for gentamicin alone. The FIC (fractional inhibitory concentration) indices ranged from 0.0945 (pronounced synergy) to 1.0625 (indifference). Synergy between marbofloxacin and gentamicin was found in 33 isolates. The mean FIC index is 0.546, which represents a partial synergistic/additive effect close to the full synergy threshold. In vitro results indicate that marbofloxacin and gentamicin as partially synergistic agents may prove clinically useful in combination therapy against P. aeruginosa infections. Although marbofloxacin is not used in the human practice, the interactions between fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides may have importance outside the veterinary field.",

The modification of quorum sensing (QS) is investigated in a system involving a co-existing signal producer and sensor bacterial cells. A pure culture of merely one bacterial species is quite rare in any niche. The interactions of different bacterial species may therefore be of special importance in pathogenicity, antibiotic resistance and signal transmission.In the present study the authors investigated the QS in model experiments involving several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species isolated from human infections or laboratory strains. The effects of various compounds on QS were studied in mixed bacterial populations during the incubation period of 24–48 h. As the simplest example of co-existing cell populations, the N -acyl homoserine lactone producing Ezf 10–17 was applied with Chromobacterium violaceum 026 as sensor.The signal of QS transmission between the co-existing QS system and pathogenic bacteria isolated from various patients was found to be modified by certain bacterial cells. The bacterial-bacterial interactions in a mixed flora can change the classical signal transmission in the microbial community and should therefore be taken into consideration in rational chemotherapy.",

This study was performed to identify the microbial etiologies of meningitis among 31 children, who were admitted in the Emergency Ward of a referral pediatric hospital in Iran. Culture identification showed that Streptococcus pneumoniae (12 subjects), Haemophilus influenzae (11 subjects) were the most common bacteria, followed by Escherichia coli (7 cases) and Neisseria meningitidis (only one case). Antibiotic susceptibility tests revealed that vancomycin had the best effect on S. pneumoniae in comparison with other antibiotics, whereas H. influenzae and E. coli were more susceptible to ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and ceftizoxime than other antibiotics. In conclusion, despite the advances in antibiotic therapy and vaccine development, bacterial meningitis still is a health problem. S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and N. meningitidis are the main sources of bacterial meningitis, but other organisms such as E. coli should also be suspected, when a case is admitted to a referral pediatric hospital.",

The aim of the study was to assess the significance of PG lysinylation in the Mtb interactions with mononuclear phagocytes. Both the Mtb strain with deletion of lysX gene (Mtb-lysX) which is responsible for PG lysinylation as well as the complemented strain (Mtb-compl) was used to infect human blood monocytes or THP-1 cells. The monocytes were obtained by MACS technique, or THP-1 cells. The Mtb-lysX strain has exhibited the enhanced sensitivity to HNP 1-3. However, it was not susceptible to bactericidal action of cathepsin G. The LysX deletion did not influence the Mtb ability of monocyte induction to IL-10 secretion. The intra- and extracellular expression of MHC-II was similarly reduced after the Mtb-lysX or Mtb-Rv infections. Noticeably significant is that the Mtb strain with deleted lysX has not affected the intensity of the gene expression of cathepsin G compared to the uninfected monocytes. That is the clear contrast to what the Mtb-Rv strain has proved. The obtained results suggest that the Mtb ability to lysinylate PG is a participatory element in mycobacterial strategy of survival inside phagocytic cells. However, the extended studies are needed to determine its influence on the other immune cells and define its role in the developing of Mtb infection.",

Enterobacterales strains were tested for antimicrobial resistance by disk diffusion method and extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) production was tested by double-disc synergy test. Strains were further subjected to a molecular assessment of ESBL and AmpC β-lactamase production by PCR. Overall, 173 bacterial isolates were studied, out of which 91.3% were Enterobacterales . Escherichia coli was the dominant pathogen, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae . High to moderate resistance rates were observed, ranging from 66% to 90.7% for penicillins, from 6.7% to 18.6% for cephalosporins and from 16.2% to 25.4% for fluoroquinolones. Enterobacterales with decreased susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins (3rd GC) carried several resistance genes: bla CTX-M group 1 and group 9, and ACC and FOX AmpC β-lactamase genes. Overall, ESBLs and AmpC β-lactamases were detected in 57% and 14% of the 3rd GC-resistant isolates, respectively. This study proved the high potential of K. pneumaniae species to develop resistance against commonly used antibiotics. Thus, rigorous monitoring of the antibiotic resistance of clinical pathogens have to be implemented in Tunisia. Our results are very relevant to evaluate efficiency of the Tunisian therapeutic strategies against UTIs and adapt them to the emerging problem of antimicrobial resistance.",

    "abstract": "The study aimed to evaluate the presence of pili in non-invasive pediatric pneumococcal isolates and to elucidate possible links with genetic lineages, serotypes, and antimicrobial resistance. We examined 147 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from children with respiratory tract infections and acute otitis media. Serotyping was performed by latex agglutination and capsule swelling reaction. Serogroup 6 was subjected to PCR-serotyping. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined according to EUCAST breakpoints. PCRs for rlrA and pitB genes were performed to detect a presence of type 1 and type 2 pili. MLST was conducted to define the clonal structure of the piliated strains. Almost all children (96.5%) were vaccinated with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine PCV10. We detected 76.8% non-PCV10 - serotypes (NVTs) and 14.3% PCV10 serotypes. The predominant serotypes were NVTs: 19A (14.3%), 6C (12.2%), 3 (9.5%), 15A (7.5%) and 6A (6.8%). PI-1 was detected among 10.9% non-PCV10 serotypes 6A, 6C, and 19A and 6.1% PCV10 serotypes 19F and 23F. Type 2 pili were not found in the studied population. High levels of antimicrobial nonsusceptibility to erythromycin (58.5%), oral penicillin (55.8%), clindamycin (46.9%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (45.6%), tetracycline (39.5%) and ceftriaxone (16.3%) were revealed. The multidrug-resistant strains (MDR) were 55.1%. MLST represented 18 STs and three CCs among the piliated pneumococci: CC386, CC320, and CC81. More than half of the piliated strains (56.0%) belonged to successfully circulating international clones. PI-1 was associated mainly with MDR 6A, 6C, 19A, 19F, and 23F isolates from the widespread CC386, CC320, and CC81.",

Influenza A and B viruses, human rhinovirus and human coronaviruses, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Klebsiella pneumoniae were investigated using real-time PCR in respiratory samples obtained during travel, at the onset of symptoms. 207 participants were included. A cough, expectoration, rhinitis and a sore throat were the most frequent respiratory symptoms, followed by loss of voice and dyspnoea. 38.7% and 25.1% of pilgrims reported a fever and influenza-like symptoms, respectively. 59.4% pilgrims received antibiotics. Rhinovirus (40.6%) was the most frequent pathogen, followed by S. aureus (35.8%) and H. influenzae (30.4%). Virus and bacteria co-infections were identified in 28.5% of participants. 25.1% pilgrims who were positive for respiratory bacteria did not receive antibiotic treatment. In the context of the Hajj pilgrimage, it is important to detect infections that can be easily managed with appropriate treatment, and those that can affect prognosis, requiring hospitalisation. POC rapid molecular diagnostic tools could be used for patient management at small Hajj medical missions and to rationalise antibiotic consumption among Hajj pilgrims.",

    "abstract": "Diarrheal diseases are of great concern worldwide and are responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality. This study investigated the epidemiology and the antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial enteropathogens among diarrheal patients of all ages in Crete, Greece during 2011-2022. Stool specimens were tested by conventional cultural methods for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (EPEC, STEC), Yersinia enterocolitica, Aeromonas species and Clostridioides difficile. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the disk diffusion method for Enterobacterales, Campylobacter and Aeromonas, and by the gradient diffusion method for C. difficile. Of the 26,060 stool samples from patients of any age, 1,022 (3.9%) were positive for bacterial enteropathogens. Campylobacter spp. were the most commonly isolated bacteria (56.4%), followed by Salmonella enterica (32.3%), and E. coli (EPEC, STEC) (6.5%). Toxigenic C. difficile was isolated from 341 out of 8,848 diarrheal specimens examined (3.9%). Resistance to ampicillin was observed in 12.4% of Salmonella, 66.7% of Shigella and 34.8% of E. coli (EPEC, STEC) isolates. Resistance to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was observed in 5.8% of Salmonella, 33.3% of Shigella, and 15.1% of E. coli (EPEC, STEC) isolates. High rates of ciprofloxacin resistance (77.3%) were detected among Campylobacter isolates, while resistance to erythromycin was observed in 2.4% of them. All C. difficile isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and metronidazole. Our findings suggest declining trends in prevalence of bacterial enteropathogens, except for Campylobacter spp. and changes in the susceptibility rates to antimicrobials. Continuous surveillance of prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial enteropathogens is mandatory for implementing targeted and effective prevention and infection control measures.",

    "abstract": "In endemic regions, tuberculosis in children constitutes a bigger fraction of total cases as compared to those in low endemic regions, regardless of the implications, this phenomenon has been historically neglected. Pediatric tuberculosis has an insidious onset and quickly develops into disseminated disease and the young are at a special risk for dissemination. Some studies suggest that measures to contain adult tuberculosis are not enough to manage tuberculosis in children, meaning that pediatric tuberculosis needs dedicated attention. Children are harder to diagnose than adults, because collecting samples is difficult, and their bacterial yield is low. In endemic countries, such as Mexico, where contact with Mycobacterium tuberculosis is common, immunological tests are inconsistent, especially in immunocompromised children. With the disruption of Mexican healthcare services by the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an uncertainty of how the situation has evolved, current data about tuberculosis indicates a drop in the national report of cases: 15.4 per 100,000 persons in 2021, compared with pre-COVID 2019 17.7 per 100,000 persons, a small increase in mortality: 1.7 per 100,000 in 2021 compared with 2019 1.6 per 100,000, a drop in treatment success: 80.4% in 2021 compared with 85.4% in 2019, and a decrease in national vaccination rates: an estimate of 86.6% children between 1 and 2 years-old were vaccinated in 2021 compared with 97.3% reported national rate in 2018-2019. There is a need for new research on regions with high tuberculosis incidence, to clarify the current situation of pediatric tuberculosis and improve epidemiological surveillance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) is one of the world's neglected diseases which is caused by Leishmania spp. The aim of this study was to assess molecular profile and antimony resistance of Leishmania isolated from human and rodent hosts. Samples were collected from suspected CL patients referred to health centres and wild rodent's traps in Gonbad-e-Qabus region, north-eastern Iran. Smears were subjected to PCR-RFLP to identify Leishmania species. In addition, ITS1-PCR products were sequenced for phylogenetic analysis. Clinical isolates and rodent samples were subjected to MTT assay to determine IC50 values and in vitro susceptibilities. Expression levels of antimony resistance-related genes were determined in CL isolates. Out of 1,949 suspected patients with CL and 148 rodents, 1,704 (87.4%) and 6 (4.05%) were positive with direct smear, respectively. Digestion patterns of BusRI (HaeIII) endonuclease enzyme were similar to what expected for Leishmania major . Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the highest interspecies similarity was found between current L. major sequences with L. major obtained from Russia and Uzbekistan. Out of 20 L. major samples tested, 13 (65%) were resistant to meglumine antimoniate (MA) treatment, with an activity index (AI) exceeding 4. The remaining 7 samples (35%) responded to MA treatment and were classified as sensitive isolates, with a confirmed sensitive phenotype based on their AI values. The comparison expression analysis of three major antimony resistance-associated genes in unresponsive clinical isolates demonstrated significant fold changes for TDR1 (4.78-fold), AQP1 (1.3-fold), and γ-GCS (1.17-fold) genes ( P &lt; 0.05). Herein, we demonstrate genetic diversity and antimony resistance of L. major isolated from human and reservoir hosts in north-eastern Iran, which could be the basis for planning future control strategies.",

This study aimed to evaluate the time required for rapid detection of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) directly from blood culture bottles to optimize empirical treatment of BSI, especially in pediatric and infant patients, using a cost-effective method. This study included 419 Gram-negative bacteria, of which Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli were the most common CPE causing BSI in pediatric and neonatal patients. Phenotypic and genotypic resistance of the selected isolates (45 K. pneumoniae and 9 E. coli) were determined by VITEK-2 Compact system and PCR, respectively. BACT/ALERT bottles were spiked with isolates. Finally, colorimetric RESIST-BC assay and Vitek-2 compact system were evaluated for the rapid detection of carbapenem-resistant bacteria directly from positive blood culture bottles. All selected isolates were phenotypically resistant to carbapenems. PCR showed that blaNDM and blaOXA-48 were present in all isolates, blaVIM was present in 44.4%, while blaKPC and blaIMP were entirely absent. The RESIST-BC kit showed good agreement with PCR for blaNDM and blaOXA-48, demonstrating high sensitivity and specificity, but not with blaVIM. These findings point out that RESIST-BC assay demonstrated an exceptionally short detection time for CPE, completing all cases within the first hour after the blood culture bottles flagged positive. It is also superior in providing a clue for clinicians on antibiotic combinations that can be administered, depending on the type of β-lactamases detected, promptly and efficiently, with low expenses.",

This current research focuses on genetic diversity, and genes involved in resistance and biofilm production of Staphylococcus aureus isolates from mobile phones of medical students. Antibiotic resistance profiling and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of antibiotic resistance and biofilm-related genes were investigated and statistically analyzed. Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) types were analyzed by multiplex PCR, and S. aureus protein A gene typing (spa typing) was done using PCR and sequencing. Sixty-four S. aureus isolates (16.8%) were obtained from 380 medical students' mobile phones who were working in hospitals. The findings showed that 71.9% of the isolates were MRSA and 78.1% were classified as MDR. All isolates exhibited sensitivity to vancomycin and linezolid. Overall, 7.8% of the isolates displayed an inducible clindamycin resistance phenotype, while 26.7% showed resistance to mupirocin. The results indicated that 68.8% of the isolates were biofilm producers, with 7 isolates (15.9%) classified as strong producers, 22 isolates (50%) as moderate producers, and 15 isolates (34.1%) as weak producers. The most prevalent type was CC8-MRSA III/t030 (18.7%), followed by CC8-MRSA III/t037 (12.5%), CC/ST22-MSSA/t790 (10.9%), CC1-MRSA IV-t114 (9.4%), CC1-MRSA IV-t127 (7.8%), CC8-MRSA V/t064 (7.8%), CC/ST15-MSSA-t360 (7.8%), CC30-MSSA/t021(6.3%), MRSA V-t355 (6.3%), CC8-MRSA III/t421 (4.7%), CC1-MRSA V-t267 (4.7%), and CC/ST15-MSSA-t084 (3.1%). The genetic diversity and prevalent multidrug resistance indicate that the resistance situation of S. aureus recovered from mobile phones in Tehran is severe, posing a potential threat to patients, the community, and healthcare settings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been in the center of attention for several years as an opportunistic human pathogen implicated in many severe acute and chronic infections particularly in immunocompromised patients. Its high persistence and resistance against many antimicrobial agents are mostly attributed to biofilm formation. Biofilms are microbial communities mainly consisting of extracellular polymeric substances that encapsulate bacteria together and protect them from extracellular stresses. This cell aggregation is a stress response that P. aeruginosa employes as a survival strategy during growth with the toxic detergents. This process has shown to involve several operons such as psl, pel, and alg . Here we used P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 in control group, 40 P. aeruginosa strains from sink and 40 strains from surface of public places. Biofilm formation and gene expression were measured before and after exposure to sub minimum inhibitory concentration (sub-MIC) of biocides chlorhexidine diacetate and benzalkonium chloride. The qRT-PCR and biofilm formation results demonstrated an increase in biofilm formation ability and gene expression of pslA/B and pelA/B in two groups collected from sink and surface in contrast to the control group. A remarkable increase was observed in the biofilm formation and expression of pslA in the bacterial strain collected from the sink after exposure to biocides chlorhexidine diacetate. Both Pel and Psl appeared to have redundant functions as structural scaffolds in biofilms. Sub-MIC levels of detergents can improve biofilm formation ability of P. aeruginosa and therefore trigger resistance.",

We evaluated prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of ESKAPE pathogens in neonates and infants subjected to cardiac surgery in a tertiary hospital in Central Kazakhstan between 2019 and 2023 (2,278 patients) using routine methods of microbiological detection. ESKAPE pathogens were found in 1,899 out of 2,957 samples (Staphylococcus aureus - 35.3%, Klebsiella pneumoniae - 27.8%, Acinetobacter baumannii - 14.5%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa - 12.4%, Enterobacter sp. - 8.8%, Enterococcus faecium - 1.2%). The total prevalence of ESKAPE increased significantly from 45.1 to 76.9% (P = 0.005) during the study period. The resistance significantly increased in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA, from 13.7 to 41.9%, P = 0.041) but decreased in carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (from 64.3 to 37.7%, P = 0.037) and carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (from 48.5 to 19.1%, P = 0.039). Gradual but non-significant changes were shown in third-generation cephalosporin resistant K. pneumoniae (from 63.6 to 45.2%) and carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (from 0 to 8.3%). The relative prevalence of ESKAPE pathogens steadily increased in our pediatric cardiac surgery patients in 2019-2023. The most frequent were S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, and A. baumannii, with dramatically increasing tendencies for MRSA.

Salmonella strains were isolated from hospitalized patients from January 2018 to April 2023. Whole-genome sequencing was performed by Illumina platform. CTX-M-producing Salmonella were identified by Comprehensive Antibiotic Research Database (CARD). Strain susceptibility to six antimicrobial agents was assessed by BD Phoenix™ M50 System. MLST analysis confirmed sequence types and additionally, serotypes were determined by SeqSero2. Genetic environments of blaCTX-M genes were analyzed by Isfinder and BLASTn. Single nucleotide polymorphisms were used to construct a phylogenetic tree to analyze homology. A total of 34 CTX-M-producing Salmonella were detected. The most prevalent serotype was Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica 1,4,[5],12:i:- (14/34, 41.18%), belonging to ST34, followed by Salmonella Enteritidis (10/34, 29.41%), belonging to ST11. The highest resistance rate was detected to ampicillin (97.06%), followed by ceftriaxone (94.12%) and ceftazidime (58.83%). In CTX-M-producing Salmonella five types of blaCTX-M genes were identified, the most prevalent was blaCTX-M-55 (47.06%, 16/34), followed by blaCTX-M-14, blaCTX-M-65, blaCTX-M-125, and blaCTX-M-27 at 26.47% (9/34), 11.77% (4/34), 8.82% (3/34), and 5.88% (2/34), respectively. Apart from blaCTX-M, 40 antibiotic resistance genes were also detected, conveying resistance to multiple drugs and the most frequent genes were namely, mcr-1.1, aph(6)-Id, aph(3″)-Ib, oqxAB, qnrB6, qnrS1. According to genetic environment analysis, the insertion sequence ISEcp1 was prevalent upstream of the blaCTX-M gene. Our study demonstrates that multiple resistance genes are carried by clinical isolates of Salmonella spp. however, the dominant ESBL genotype is CTX-M-55, that is associated with ISEcp1.",

The determination of viral genotype is crucial in choosing antiviral treatment, determining the duration of therapy, and monitoring treatment respose. Since 2014, with the usage of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) in the treatment of HCV infections, a cure rate over 95% could be possible. Epidemiological data are important to combat a chronic HCV infections. Due to its geographical location, Turkey is like a bridge connecting Asia and Europe. Istanbul is the biggest and most crowded city of Turkey and has received immigration from many different countries, especially from Syria, in recent years and immigration still goes on. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has had devastating effects in our country. In this study, we determined the HCV genotypes in Health Sciences University Ümraniye Training and Research Hospital, in Istanbul between 2016 and 2022. Of the 322 patients analyzed during this 7-year period, HCV GT1b was the most prevalent GT in 65.2%, followed by GT3 in 15.5%, GT1a in 10.6%. Our data serve as a great mirror for HCV epidemiology in Turkey and contribute to global data.",

    "abstract": "Shigellosis, a diarrheal disease caused by Shigella species, is a significant public health concern, particularly in developing countries with inadequate sanitation systems. This study aimed to investigate the patterns of antibiotic resistance, ESBL and AmpC genes, integrons, and enterotoxin genes in Shigella species isolated from patients with gastroenteritis in Northeast Iran. This cross-sectional study was conducted between January 2017 and December 2019 at a tertiary care hospital in Northeast Iran. A total of 110 Shigella isolates were collected from stool samples of patients with gastroenteritis. The isolates were identified using conventional biochemical tests and confirmed by PCR. The highest resistance rates were detected for ampicillin (88.2%) and cotrimoxazole (84.5%). Altogether 64.5% of isolates exhibited multidrug resistance however, ESBL and AmpC phenotypes were detected in 34.54% and 1.81% of isolates, respectively. Interestingly, blaCTX-M-15 and blaTEM were detected in all ESBL-positive isolates but integron class 1, 2, and 3 were identified in 97.3%, 76.4%, and 59.1% of isolates, respectively. The sen gene was present in 72.7% of the isolates. In this study CTX-M-15 production was detected in 31 strains of Shigella sonnei and in 7 strains of Shigella flexneri. The high prevalence of multidrug-resistant Shigella isolates is concerning and shows the need for continuous monitoring and rational use of antibiotics.",

It is mainly related to a primary maternal infection. The placenta should be considered the most important site of both the protection of the fetus from CMV infection and the transmission of CMV from mother to fetus. The control of the passage of CMV across the placenta probably involves a cascade of regulatory events. Roles are played by factors relating to the host immune-selective pressures, such as local cytokines and maternal CMV-specific neutralizing antibodies. The presence of other pathogens at the maternal-fetal interface also influences the outcome of CMV infection. Further investigations are needed in which clinical CMV strains are applied in in vitro studies to unravel the molecular mechanism of the intrauterine transmission of CMV and to elucidate the complex regulation that leads to prevention of the in utero transmission of CMV in vivo.",

To gain deeper insight into the Th1 immune response activated by these bacteria, we have analyzed the interferon (IFN), interleukin-12 (IL-12) and IL-18-inducing activities of different Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus strains in human monocytes and murine bone marrow macrophages. A large majority of the S. aureus strains elicited the simultaneous production of IL-12 p70 and IFN-a in the human monocytes, while the S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus strains induced only a low level of production, if any, of these cytokines. Furthermore, a majority of the S. aureus strains induced significantly higher IL-12 p70 and IL-18 titers in the murine bone marrow macrophages than did the S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus strains. As IL-12, IL-18 and IFN-a stimulate Th1 differentiation synergistically, we suggest that S. aureus strains bias the immune response toward a Th1 phenotype, whereas S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus strains provide a weaker stimulus for the production of Th1-inducing cytokines, and accordingly possibly elicit a less extensive Th1-associated adaptive immunity.",

    "abstract": "The heavy metal lead is an environmental toxic material that can induce pathophysiological changes in many organ systems. Previous studies have shown the effects of lead exposure on immune cells in different experimental animals, however, the mechanism of their influence on the immune system is unclear. We reported that in vivo lead exposure inhibits phagocytosis, nitric oxide release, induces DNA fragmentation suggesting the apoptotic death of the target cell. We have also presented evidence that inhibition of macrophage functional responses implicated alteration of humoral and cell mediated immunity. In vivo exposure to lead acetate alters the phagocytic capacity of splenic macrophages as evident from the reduction of phagocytic index of control from 19,792±1385.69 to 8893 ± 893 in the treated group. The amount of nitric oxide released by the control cell 2.25 ± 0.125 µM is also reduced to 1.9375 ± 0.0625 µM upon in vivo lead treatment. Functional integrity of the target cell is also decreased after lead exposure as obtained from the percentage of DNA fragmentation. Control group shows 33.29 ± 0.11% of fragmented DNA, which is enhanced to 42.43 ± 0.725% following the lead treatment. A greater percentage of DNA fragmentation upon lead treatment probably indicating that the heavy metal induces apoptosis. The humoral immune response is also altered after lead exposure as indicated by the decrease of the antibody titre in control group from 1:2048 to1:128 in the treated group. From the DTH reaction, it was observed that the mean diameter of swollen foot pad of control mice is 0.329 ± 0.15 cm and that of lead treated mice is 0.274 ± 0.056 cm. It can, therefore, be suggested that lead inhibits normal functional activities of splenic leukocytes, particularly phagocytosis and also affects the functional integrity of cells by inducing DNA fragmentation. The study may demonstrate the usefulness of investigation of humoral immune system and leukocyte functions as sensitive parameters in detecting the effects of lead toxicity.",

    "abstract": "The tumor-inducing effects of Agrobacterium, Bartonella and Helicobacter bacterial species are compared step by step. An analogy for the existence of these individual steps is considered in connection with the development of cancer. The transformations of eukaryotic cells occur in particular in the type IV secretion system, i.e. involving the simultaneous transmission of DNA and protein from bacterial cells to eukaryotic cells. Thus, transfected cells facilitate the indefinite growth of tissue cells and additionally produce growth factors, triggering further bacterial multiplication. The higher numbers of bacteria then produce more transfection and the cycle repeats as long as the host lives. The main limiting factor is the frequency of bacterial infection, while the secondary rate-limiting factors are the levels of transforming growth factors and factors triggering bacteria growth.Analogous processes are probably responsible for the tumor induction by the three different bacterial species; however, the critical points for eradication are different. The early eradication or limitation of B. henselae or H. pylori can prevent hemangiomas, stomach cancer and malignant cell proliferation. The crown gall formation by A. tumefaciens can only be avoided by prevention of the transforming activity of a single bacterial infection. Questions arise as to what is common in the three processes, and the nature of the rate-limiting step in the three different models. The frequency of transformation is the rate-limiting step, but the co-transmission of the DNA-protein complex is common in the three systems.",

    "abstract": "Animal models greatly facilitate understanding of transmission, pathogenesis and immune responses in HIV and SIV infection and provide models for studies on the effect of candidate drugs or vaccines. However, there are several aspects that one should consider when drawing conclusions from results obtained from animal models. First, the genetic relationship of primate lentiviruses cannot be disregarded because it is known that HIV-1 is more closely related to SIV of chimpanzee origin (SIVcpz) than to SIV from sooty mangabey (SIVsm) origin. Nevertheless, SIVsm and SIVmac are the ones most often used as model systems. Second, there are differences in the biological properties, like CXCR4 use and CD4-independent coreceptor use, of HIV and SIV. These differences might be relevant in virus transmission, pathogenesis and in evoking immune responses. Third, in vivo and in vitro selection may influence the results. Neutralizing antibodies may play a role in selection of variant viruses since neutralization sensitive, CD4-independent SIVsm variants seemed to be suppressed in animals that mounted a neutralizing antibody response. It is tempting to speculate that neutralizing antibodies shape the SIV/HIV infection by selecting variants with a more “closed” envelope conformation with consequences for both receptor binding and neutralization sensitivity. The SIV/monkey model, although it has important advantages, may not answer all questions asked about HIV-1 infection in human.",

With regard to alcohol consumption habits the immunohaematological indices were investigated in the following four groups: abstinents, light alcohol users, moderate alcohol users and alcohol abusers. We determined the compensatory mechanisms of immune system functions of moderate alcohol users and alcohol abusers in comparison with abstinents in the relatively clean Sirvintos district. In the Trakai district polluted with industrial siftings such compensatory reactions where not found.

Interestingly, fluorescence polarization measurements of the clinical isolates displayed enhanced membrane fluidity in fluconazole resistant strains as compared to the sensitive ones. The increase in fluidity was reflected in the change of membrane order, which was considerably decreased (decrease in fluorescence polarization \"p\" value denotes higher membrane fluidity) in the resistant strains. The ergosterol content in azole susceptible isolates was greater, almost twice as compared to the resistant isolates. However, no significant alteration was observed in phospholipid and fatty acid composition of these isolates. Labeling experiments with fluorescamine dye revealed that the percentage of phosphatidylethanolamine exposed to the membrane's outer leaflet was higher in the resistant strains as compared to the sensitive strains, indicating increased floppase activity of the two major ABC drug efflux pumps, CDR1 and CDR2 possibly due to their overexpression in resistant strains. The results of the present study suggest that changes in the status of membrane lipid phase especially the ergosterol content and increased activity of drug efflux pumps by overexpression ofABC transporters, CDR1 and CDR2 might contribute to fluconazole resistance in C. albicans isolated from AIDS/HIV patients.",

    "abstract": "Oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) is reported to be effective in treatment of recurrent herpes simplex (RHS). According to our observation during recent years, OPV was not only effective in management of RHS but also in some patients with concomitant recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) reducing its severity and frequency. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of OPV in the management of RAS. In a longitudinal, case--control study 48 patients with RAS were recruited. Twenty patients received OPV and 28 patients received placebo. OPV was administered in a dose of 4 drops at monthly intervals for 3 months to the study group while the control group received placebo. The results were registered in 3 months after the last dose. Eight cases (40%) in the OPV group showed significant reduction in the duration of the ulcers, while no change was seen in the control group (P = 0.048). The frequency of recurrence of RAS was reduced in 13 cases (65%) in the OPV group, and in 6 cases (21.4%) of the placebo group (P = 0.006). The severity of attacks was reduced in 12 cases (60%) in the OPV group and in 4 cases (14.3%) in the placebo group (P = 0.008). In conclusion OPV appeared to be effective in the management of RAS.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is a common pathogen causing hospital infections. The increasing rate of healthcare-associated infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in developing countries has led to many public health problems. This study aimed to investigate the molecular epidemiology as well as the antibiotic resistance pattern of clinical isolates of MRSA from Southern Iran. A total of 135 S. aureus isolates were collected from the patients referred to three hospitals in South Iran. The phenotypic and genotypic diagnosis of MRSA isolates was performed by disk diffusion and PCR methods, respectively. The antibiotic resistance pattern for MRSA isolates was performed using Kirby-Bauer method. The molecular epidemiology of isolates was performed by MLST, Spa typing and SCCmec typing. From 135 S. aureus isolates, 50 (37%) MRSA strains were detected from which two different sequence types including ST239 and ST605 were identified. SCCmec type III was the most common profile (50%) and t030 was the predominant spa type (48%) among the strains. The MRSA isolates had the highest resistance to penicillin (100%), tetracycline (88%), levofloxacin (86%), ciprofloxacin (84%), erythromycin (82%), gentamicin (80%), and clindamycin (78%). The results of this study show that the most common genetic type among the MRSA isolates was ST239-SCCmec III/t030. The rapid and timely detection of MRSA and the administration of appropriate antibiotics according to the published antibiotic resistance patterns are essential. Furthermore, the continuous and nationwide MRSA surveillance studies are necessary to investigate clonal distribution and spreading of MRSA from community to hospitals.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The management of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) presents a main challenge and the drug options for treating these infections are very limited. Linezolid (LNZ) has recently been approved for the treatment of MDR and XDR-TB. But, there are narrow data on genotypic and phenotypic LNZ resistance in clinical isolates. So, we aimed to determine the prevalence of LNZ resistance and to identify the mutations associated with LNZ resistance among clinical MDR-TB isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of LNZ for 22 MDR-TB isolates were determined by broth microdilution method. All MDR-TB isolates were sequenced in the rrl and rplC genes conferring LNZ resistance. LNZ resistance was found in 3 (13.6%) of 22 MDR-TB isolates. The MICs of LNZ were 8 μg/mL for two isolates and 16 μg/mL for one isolate. The 421 (A/G) and 449 (T/A) mutations in rplC gene were detected in one of the LNZ-resistant isolates. There was no mutation in rrl gene. The results reveal that the prevalence of LNZ-resistant isolates is 13.6% among MDR-TB isolates and drug susceptibility testing (DST) against LNZ is useful in the management of complicated and drug-resistant cases. However, further studies could identify other possible genetic mechanism of resistance in TB.",

Carbapenemase genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction. CZA sensitivity of isolates was evaluated with broth microdilution (BMD) and disk diffusion methods. A total of 318 carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales isolates were included. Most of the isolates ( n = 290, 91.2%) were identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae . The most common carbapenemase type was OXA-48 ( n = 82, 27.6%). CZA susceptibility was evaluated in 84 isolates with OXA-48 and KPC carbapenemase activity. Both BMD and disk diffusion methods revealed that 95.2% of the isolates were sensitive to CZA; whereas, 4 (4.76%) isolates were resistant to CZA. Among colistin resistant isolates, 96.5% ( n = 80) of them were susceptible to CZA. Our study demonstrated high in vitro efficacy of CZA in Enterobacterales isolates producing OXA-48 carbapenemase. High susceptibility rates against colistin resistant isolates which generally are also pan drug resistant, makes CZA a promising therapeutic choice for difficult-to-treat infections. Due to its high correlation with the BMD, disk diffusion method is a suitable and more practical method in detecting CZA in vitro activity.",

This study evaluated the antibiotic susceptible phenotypes, biofilm-producing ability, and biofilm-associated genes ( mecA, ica AD, bap , cna , and fnb A). Biofilm formation was detected through Congo red agar (CRA) method and MTP method. The presence of biofilm and associated genes in MR- CoNS were detected by PCR. A total of 310 (55.95%) isolates produced the biofilm. Among these isolates, Staphylococcus haemolyticus (34.83%), Staphylococcus epidermis (31.93%), Staphylococcus capitis (16.77%), Staphylococcus cohnii (10.96%), and Staphylococcus hominis (5.48%) were identified. The antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of CoNS isolates indicated resistance to cefoxitin (100%), erythromycin (94.8%), ciprofloxacin (66.7%), sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (66.7%), gentamicin (66.12%), and clindamycin (62.9%). Resistance rate to mupirocin was 48.5% in S . epidermidis and 38.9% in S. haemolyticus isolates. All isolates were sensitive to vancomycin and linezolid. The prevalence rates of icaAD, bap, fnbA , and cna were 18.06%, 12.5%, 47.4%, and 27.4%, respectively. ica AD and bap genes were detected in 18.06% and 12.5% of MR-CoNS isolates. fnb A and cna genes were detected in 47.41% and 27.41% of MRCoNS isolates. icaAD positive strains exhibited a significant increase in the biofilm formation compared with those that lacked ica AD (0.86 (0.42, 1.39) versus 0.36 (0.14, 0.75), respectively; P &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, the majority of MR-CoNS isolates were biofilm producers, and S . capitis , which possessed icaAD genes, ranked as the great biofilm producer than other Staphylococcus . The study’s findings are important to form a strategy to control biofilm formation as an alternative strategy to counter the spread of MR-CoNS in healthcare settings.",

In order to survive in host tissues, the Pa strains are known to utilize a wide range of virulence-, and fitness factors. Many of these virulence-, and drug resistance factors have their genetic determinants on the chromosome, but some others reside on mobile genetic elements [1]. One of the most remarkable and concerning characteristics of Pa is the low antibiotic susceptibility, which under certain conditions can be enhanced by the uptake of mobile elements that may help commensal strains of Pa to develop into multidrug resistant human pathogens [2]. Phenotypic resistance can be further increased by appropriate changes in colony formation such as biofilms, or small colony variation [3].",

The DBELIA test was positive in 86.7% (56/60) and negative in 13.3% (8/60), while the immunocomb-Eliza was positive in 91.7% (55/60) and negative in 8.3% (5/60). IFAT revealed 90.0% (54/60) of DBELIA samples as positive while 10.0% (6/50) as negative, with an agreement of 83.3% (50/60). IFAT revealed 96.7% (58/60) of immunocomb-Eliza samples as positive and 3.3% (2/60) as negative, with an agreement of 91.7% (55/60). There was an overall agreement of 86.7% (52/60) among the three assays. Five (62.5%) of the 8 disagreement were of low IFAT, titre range < 1:240 attributable to false initial IFAT results from non-specific antibody binding, cross-reactivity or antigenic variations.A positive correlation was observed in the results of the 3 assays with correlation coefficients (r 2 ) of 0.8214 at P<0.0001 and 0.8984 at P<0.001 for IFAT-DBELIA and IFAT-immunocomb-Eliza, respectively. No statistically significant differences were observed in their results. The chi-square values were 0.9021, P-0.3142 and 0.04322, P-0.7624 for DBELIA and immunocomb-Eliza, respectively.

Learning is carried out in a very primitive form, and the memory is not neural but an epigenetic one. However, this epigenetic memory, which is well justified by the presence and manifestation of hormonal imprinting, is strong and permanent in the life of cell and also in its progenies. This memory is epigenetically executed by the alteration and fixation of methylation pattern of genes without changes in base sequences. The immunity of unicellulars is based on self/non-self discrimination, which leads to the destruction of non-self invaders and utilization of them as nourishment (by phagocytosis). The tools of learning, memory, and immunity of unicellulars are uniformly found in plasma membrane receptors, which formed under the effect of dynamic receptor pattern generation, suggested by Koch et al., and this is the basis of hormonal imprinting, by which the encounter between a chemical substance and the cell is specifically memorized. The receptors and imprinting are also used in the later steps of evolution up to mammals (including man) in each mentioned functions. This means that learning, memory, and immunity can be deduced to a unicellular eukaryote level.",

    "abstract": "L. pneumophila is an intracellular bacterium that replicates inside a membrane-bound vacuole called Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV), where it plentifully liberates its HtpB chaperonin. From LCV, HtpB reaches the host cell cytoplasm, where it interacts with SAMDC, a cytoplasmic protein required for synthesis of host polyamines that are important for intracellular growth of L. pneumophila. Additionally, cytoplasmic expression of HtpB in S. cerevisiae induces pseudohyphal growth, and in mammalian cells recruits mitochondria to LCV, and modifies actin microfilaments organization. This led us to hypothesize here that HtpB recruits a protein(s) from eukaryotic cells that is involved in the emergence of the aforementioned phenotypes. To identify this protein, a commercially available HeLa cDNA library was screened using a yeast two-hybrid system. Approximately 5×10(6) yeast clones carrying HeLa cDNA library plasmid were screened. Twenty-one positive clones were identified. DNA sequence analysis revealed that all of these positive clones encoded the mammalian small heat shock protein Hsp10. Based on the fact that chaperonions are required to interact with co-chaperonins to function properly in protein folding, we believe that HtpB recruits the host cell Hsp10 to appropriately interact with SAMDC and to induce the multifunction phenotypes deemed important in L. pneumophila pathogenesis.",

A molecular identification key was established for identifying those genera and species within the family Streptococcaceae which have an already known full genome sequence (24 Streptococcus and 2 Lactococcus species). Identical genome parts of the species belonging to the same genus were used for determination of genera. These are the sections surrounding the replication origin dnaA, the sequence from gene phaB to the gene accA, and the sequence of alr acpS secA.

The current study aims to determine the antimicrobial resistance in N. gonorrhoeae and associated molecular typing to enhance gonococcal antimicrobial surveillance in Hungary. In the National N. gonorrhoeae Reference Laboratory of Hungary 187 N. gonorrhoeae infections were detected in 2013, antibiograms were determined for all the isolated strains, and 52 (one index strain from every sexually contact related group) of them were also analysed by the N. gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence typing (NG-MAST) method. Twenty-two different NG-MAST sequence types (STs) were identified, of which 8 STs had not been previously described. In Hungary, the highly diversified gonococcal population displayed high resistance to penicillin, ciprofloxacin and tetracycline (the antimicrobials previously recommended for gonorrhoea treatment). Resistance to the currently recommended extended spectrum cephalosporines were rare: only two of the expected strains, an ST 1407 and an ST 210, had cefixime MIC above the resistance breakpoint. By the revision of our National Treatment Guideline, it must be considered, that the azithromycin resistance is about 60% among the four most frequently isolated STs in Hungary.",

This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on 68 fusidic acid resistant S. aureus strains to learn about the molecular characteristics and antimicrobial resistance of strains isolated from hospitalized patients. In the present study, the prevalence of resistance to fusidic acid in S. aureus isolates was 15.1%. Fusidic acid resistance determinative factors (fusB, fusC and fusD) were identified by multiplex PCR assay. To detect the existence of fusA and fusE determinants and their mutation status, amplifications and sequencing were performed. Molecular characterization of fusidic acid resistant isolates was investigated by SCCmec and spa typing methods. All strains were MRSA and multi drug resistant. Two (2.9%) and 31 (45.6%) isolates were resistant to vancomycin and mupirocin respectively. The SCCmec type IV was highly prevalent representing 50% followed by types III (51.5%), and SCCmec types II (13.2%). fusB, was the most predominant acquired gene (66.2%) followed by fusC (19.1%), and fusA (14.7%). The mutations in fusA were present in 10 isolates with 5 (50%) having L461K mutation showing fusidic acid MIC values of ≥256 μg ml-1 followed by H457Y (40%), and H457Q (10%) showing fusidic acid MIC values of 128 and 64 μg ml-1 respectively. Isolates were allocated to ten particular t030 (22.1%), t037 (14.6%), t408 (11.8%), t064 (11.8%), t008 (10.3%), t002 (8.8%), t005 (5.9%), t790 (5.9%), t318 (4.4%), and t018 (4.4%) spa types. fusA positive isolates were assigned to particular spa types t002 (60%), and t005 (40%). There may be be a spreading of fusidic acid resistance among MRSA, creating worrying public concern. This research notes the importance of adequate data of local prevalence of FA-resistant MRSA in Iran for taking appropriate measures to treat, control and reduce the incidence of these isolates.",

Our aim was to evaluate the epidemiological relationship between carbapenem-resistant (CR) Enterobacteriaceae isolates from patients in COVID-19 wards and to investigate the main mechanisms of carbapenem resistance in these isolates during the period April 2020-July 2021. A total of 45 isolates were studied: Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 37), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 2), Enterobacter cloacae complex (n = 4) and Escherichia coli (n = 2). Multiplex PCR was used for detection of genes encoding carbapenemases from different classes (blaKPC, blaIMP, blaVIM, blaNDM, blaOXA-48). For epidemiological typing and analysis, ERIC PCR was performed. Two clinical isolates of E. cloacae, previously identified as representatives of two dominant hospital clones from the period 2014-2017, were included in the study for comparison. In the CR K. pneumoniae group, 23 (62.2%) carried blaKPC, 13 (35.1%) blaNDM, 10 (27.0%) blaVIM, and 9 (24.3%) were positive for both blaKPC and blaVIM. The blaKPC was identified also in the two isolates of K. oxytoca and blaVIM in all E. cloacae complex isolates. The two CR isolates of E. coli possessed blaKPC and blaOXA-48 genes. Epidemiological typing identified 18 ERIC profiles among K. pneumoniae, some presented as clusters of identical and/or closely related isolates. The carbapenem resistance in the studied collection of isolates is mediated mainly by blaKPC. During the COVID-19 pandemic intrahospital dissemination of CR K. pneumoniae, producing carbapenemases of different molecular classes, as well as continuing circulation of dominant hospital clones of multidrug-resistant E. cloacae complex was documented.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent scientific research has indicated that the gut microbiota constitutes a nuanced, diverse ecosystem of microorganisms that have gained significant attention due to its crucial involvement in shaping human health and diseases. In particular, the gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in cancer prevention, and disturbances in its composition and function, known as dysbiosis, that have been linked to an increased risk of developing various malignancies. The gut microbiota exerts a myriad of effects on the production of anti-cancer compounds, the host's immune system and inflammation, underscoring its crucial involvement in cancer. Additionally, recent studies have shown that the gut microbiota has a role in the development of cancer, influencing cancer risk, co-infections, disease progression, and treatment response. The observation of reduced efficacy of immunotherapy in patients receiving antibiotic treatment indicates a substantial influence of the microbiota in mediating the toxicity and response of cancer therapy, notably immunotherapy, and its immune-related side effects. A growing body of research has focused on cancer treatments that target the microbiome, including probiotics, dietary modifications, and faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). The forthcoming era of personalised cancer therapies is anticipated to prioritise tumor evolution, molecular and phenotypic heterogeneity, and immunological profiling, with gut microbiota assuming a pivotal position in this domain. This review aims to offer clinicians a comprehensive perspective on the microbiota-cancer axis, including its influence on cancer prevention and therapy and highlights the importance of integrating microbiome science into the design and implementation of cancer therapies.",

PCR amplification, enzymatic assays, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and biofilm quantification on a polystyrene plate were performed. The incidence of virulence determinants was as follows: stmPr1 (encoding for the major extracellular protease StmPr1) 87.3%, stmPr2 (minor extracellular protease StmPr2) 99.1%, Smlt3773 locus (outer membrane esterase) 98.2%, plcN1 (non-hemolytic phospholipase C) 99.1%, and smf-1 (type-1 fimbriae, biofilm-related gene) 96.4%. The 1621-bp allele of stmPr1 was most frequently found (61.1%), followed by the combined allelic variant (17.6%), stmPr1 -negative genotype (12.7%), and 868-bp allele (8.6%). Protease, esterase, and lecithinase activity was observed in 95%, 98.2%, and 17.2% of the isolates, respectively. The WGS-subjected isolates ( n = 9) formed two groups. Five isolates possessed only the 1621-bp variant of stmPr1 , higher biofilm formation ability (Optical Density at λ = 550 nm (OD 550 ): 1.253–1.789), as well as a low number of mutations in the protease genes and smf-1 . Three other isolates had only the 868-bp variant, weaker biofilm production (OD 550 : 0.788–1.108), and higher number of mutations within these genes. The only weak biofilm producer (OD 550 = 0.177) had no stmPr1 alleles. In conclusion, the similar PCR detection rates did not allow differentiation of the isolates. In contrast, WGS permitted stmPr1 alleles-based differentiation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Bulgarian study presenting genotypic and phenotypic insights into virulence factors of S. maltophilia isolates.",

Aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical and microbiological characteristics of nocardiosis, antimicrobial resistance profiles, treatment, and outcomes of Nocardia infection over the last 5 years at our institution. The medical records and microbiological data of patients affected by nocardiosis and treated at the university hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, between 2018 and 2022, were retrospectively analyzed. The isolates were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and through sequencing of 16S rRNA. Antimicrobial susceptibility for 17 agents was determined by E-test and results were interpreted according to CLSI guidelines. Among the 28 Nocardia isolates, eight species were identified, with Nocardia brasiliensis being the most prevalent (32.1%), followed by Nocardia otitidiscaviarum (25%), and Nocardia farcinica (14.3%). Skin and soft tissue infections were the most common presentations, noted in 13 (50%) patients, followed by pulmonary infection presented in 10 (38.5%) patients. Fifteen patients (57.7%) had at least one underlying disease, and 11 (42.3%) were on immunosuppressive or long-term corticosteroid treatment.

Conventional PCR assays were conducted for detection of mcr-1 gene and common carbapenemase genes (blaVIM, blaNDM, blaIMP, blaKPC, blaOXA-23, blaOXA-51 and blaOXA-48). Rep-PCR assay was conducted to determine the genetic relatedness of the study isolates. Majority of the isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae (83%). Carbapenem resistant K. pneumoniae cluster was observed from ICU and surgical ward samples. Colistin resistance was observed in 13% (12/93) of the isolates namely, in 11 K. pneumoniae and one Enterobacter cloacae. The blaOXA-48 (65%) was the most prevalent gene detected followed by blaNDM (25%) and blaVIM (22%). Several K. pneumoniae isolates concomitantly carried multiple carbapenemase genes with one isolate carry up to 5 five genes blaVIM, blaNDM, blaOXA-48, blaOXA-23 and blaOXA-51. The mcr-1 gene was not detected in the isolates. Rep-PCR assay showed that most isolates matched cluster A (50%). The high prevalence of blaOXA-48, blaNDM and emerging colistin resistant isolates is of concern for patient management at this institution and needs close monitoring. Rep-PCR is a valuable tool in establishing infection clusters in resource-limited settings.",

The rate of multiresistant MRSA strains has decreased gradually from 98.1% in 1997 to 74.6% in 2000, accordingly the typability by phages showed a considerable improvement by the international basic phages. Resistance pattern of MRSA strains became narrower in the period of the examinations. With the exception of erythromycin the rate of resistance decreased probably as a consequence of the increased use of erythomycin. The typing method was completed with the phenotypic and genotypic characterization of macrolide resistance. Among 73 MRSA strains type A was the most frequent macrolide resistance group, while type B, C1 and C2 occurred rarely. Type A was frequent also among the few MSSA and CNS strains. Out of the 168 examined S. aureus strains ermA genes occurred in 81.5%; in MSSA and CNS strains ermC1 genes were frequent, both genes are responsible for the target modification. The msrA gene, encoding the increased efflux, occurred only in CNS strains. Comparing the results obtained by phenotyping (phage typing) and genotyping (AP-PCR) methods it is of note that MRSA strains which proved non-typable by phage typing gave suitable results by the AP-PCR.",

By activating resting T cells, Nef creates an optimal environment for lentivirus replication. In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected macrophages and microglial cells Nef activates the production of T-cell attracting chemokines and contributes to the development HIV infection associated brain damage. Nef also functions as an adaptor or connector protein downregulating CD4 and CCR5, the key receptor and one of the coreceptors for HIV. It also downregulates cell surface expression of a subset of class I MHC molecules which contributes to viral immune evasion. Extracellular, soluble Nef may facilitate the spread of T-cell-tropic HIV variants and mediate a switch in dominant replicating HIV strains (from macrophage- tropic to T-cell-tropic viruses) in AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) patients. Virion-bound Nef enhances infectivity. Nef is a potential target of antiretroviral therapy and nef-deleted (attenuated) retroviruses have been considered as candidate vaccines against HIV. We suggest that nef-deleted or highly mutated defective HIV (dHIV) genomes interfere with replication of “wild type” HIV in certain long-term non-progressor individuals. This implies that introduction of artificially constructed dHIV genomes (by infusion of leukocytes carrying dHIV proviruses) into HIV infected individuals could slow disease progression and could be considered as a therapeutic possibility.",

    "abstract": "After a short explanatory Introduction, an immunotherapy protocol is presented for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). GBM is considered to be an incurable tumor; tumor-free survival over 2 to 3 years is so rare that when it happens the original diagnosis is questioned. It is known that the type of the genetic mutation that a given GBM tumor harbors strongly influences the length of survival. However, most patients with GBM are receiving treatment without the preparation of a microarray gene map of their tumors. It is possible that the reason for a rare and exceptional long survival was not the treatment that the patient received, but the type of gene mutations that the tumor was exposed to. It is recognized that any therapeutic approach should ideally be evaluated against the background of all prognostic factors of each individual case, prominent among them the microarray gene map of the tumor. In practice, this is not easily achieved, while the patient is in need of, and is expecting, prompt therapy. Insurance companies do not reimburse the patient, or the clinical investigators, or their institutions for investigational diagnostic tests, or such treatment modalities. A temporary compromise is possible. The emergence of empirically administered treatment modalities with extraordinary efficacy has occasionally been recorded in the history of medical oncology. In some of these rare clinical trials, the control groups were discontinued (to the dismay of the statisticians), and the control patients were enrolled in the treatment groups so to escape doom and share the benefit of the unfolding high remission inductions experienced in the treatment group. Chemo-radiotherapy of Hodgkin's disease and cisplatin therapy of certain testicular carcinomas provided the first éclat examples. More recently, the rapidly approved and marketed imitanib mesylate for Ph-chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia and the anti-HER2/neu monoclonal antibody trastuzumab, and the not yet marketed double tyrosine kinase (ErbB1/2) inhibitor lapatinib (Tykerb, GlaxoSmithKline) for a subgroup of breast carcinoma patients excelled. Thus, a clinical trial for GBM, but without precise pre-identification of all its prognostic factors, however with a great deal of evidence-based empirical expectations of benefits, for patients with rapid advarcement toward a fatal outcome, implying an element of urgency, appears to be justified.",

Addition of NaCl (2%) to TSB medium, was involved in the protection of cells against heat inactivation, this protective effect was, however, not observed by increasing the NaCl concentration up to 8%.The combined effect of the pH and NaCl on the thermal resistance of both strains was significantly lower at pH 2.5 and NaCl 8%, the number of viable cells decreased from approximately 10 8 CFU/ml to an undetectable number within 20 min for strain EC 1 and 15 min for strain EC 2 , respectively.This study indicates that heat resistance of strain EC1 was enhanced after acid or thermal adaptation. Heat resistance of strain EC2 was, however, enhanced only after thermal adaptation. For both strains no relationship was found between salt adaptation and the ability to resist thermal stress.",

The ESBL isolates were found indistinguishable in each of these laboratory tests, one genetic clone were revealed in the background of ESBL cases by PFGE. The ESBL positive isolates were proven to harbour a approximately 62 Md plasmid and two class-1 integrons (0.9 kb, 1.875 kb). With respect to their clinical relatedness and our laboratory findings there was a small outbreak caused by the ESBL clone. PCR-sequencing were performed on the outbreak strain and has revealed a blaSHV gene that encodes for an SHV-2a type ESBL enzyme.

The five vaccine formulations, adjuvant, and BCG vaccine were subcutaneously injected into mice, and the sera were collected at days 0, 15, 30, 41, and 66. The humoral and cellular immune responses against vaccine formulations were determined by measuring serum IgG and serum interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) levels, respectively. All formulations significantly increased IgG levels post-vaccination. The highest increase in IFN-γ level was provided by MmaA4 formulation. The Erp, HspR, and LppX formulations were as effective as BCG in enhancement of IFN-γ level. The most efficient vaccine boosting the IL-12 level was HspR formulation, especially at day 66. Erp formulation also increased the IL-12 level more than BCG at days 15 and 30. The IL-12 level boosted by MmaA4 formulation was found to be similar to that by BCG.

SLE could present with broad spectrum of clinical and laboratory features that can resemble those of other diseases, such as hemopoietic malignancies, infections, or immune-mediated disorders. Its complexity and protean features overlap with many other diseases, hindering the differential diagnosis. Rarely, true overlap with other diseases may occur. Herein, we report a case series of two patients affected by infectious diseases, namely visceral leishmaniasis and Whipple’s disease (WD), intertwined with clinical or serological features of SLE. In both cases, several confounding factors have led to a delay in the diagnosis. Moreover, we first describe the persistent elevation of autoantibodies and a monoclonal gammopathy in a patient with WD. Awareness of unusual presentations of infections or other rare disorders, which may be encountered in clinical practice when taking care of SLE patients, is essential for timely diagnosis and treatment of potentially lethal diseases.",

Antibiotic susceptibility was investigated as well as Shiga-toxin production. All isolates were identified as E. coli by MALDI-TOF while the PCR showed a disparate group of 26 EIEC, 11 Shigella spp., 5 E. coli and 1 inactive E. coli . However, the sequencing of gyrB gene, which was recently described as a suitable marker for distinguishing E. coli and Shigella spp., identified all isolates as E. coli . Antibiotic resistance was noticeable against ß-lactams, rifampicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin. The most common variants of beta-lactamase genes were bla TEM-1 , bla CTX-M-15, and bla CTX-M-3 . A great discordance between the used methods in identification was revealed herein. An accurate identification technique able to distinguish E. coli from Shigella spp. in routine laboratories is a pressing need in order to select the appropriate treatment and assess the epidemiology of these bacteria.",

EfrAB is a heterodimeric multidrug ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that causes endogenous resistance to antimicrobials including fluoroquinolones in Enterococcus spp. The aim of this study was to seek the gene expression rate and role of efrAB efflux pump in ciprofloxacin resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) of multiresistant isolates. Phenotypic and genotyping identification of 80 E. faecalis isolates were performed. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to ciprofloxacin (CIP) were measured with and without carbonylcyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) by broth microdilution. After DNA extraction and sequencing for detection of efrA and efrB genes, the e frAB efflux positive isolates that were resistant to ciprofloxacin and showed decrease of ciprofloxacin MIC range were identified. Isolates that exhibited decrease in ciprofloxacin MIC range from two to ten folds were assessed for biofilm formation and finally, the expression levels of efrB, efrA genes were measured by quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR). High rates of resistance to tetracycline and minocycline and low rates of resistance to the most antibiotics used in this study were detected. The results in this study indicated that the incidence of Multiple drug resistance (MDR) was 23.7% and all isolates that were resistant to ciprofloxacin revealed several degrees of overexpression in efrA and efrB genes. Our study found two ST480 and one ST847 in E. faecalis isolates. In conclusion, despite of low frequency of resistance to the most antibiotics and MDRs in our region, we found one ST480 isolate with resistance to eight antibiotics that also exists in other parts of the world.",

Furthermore, hand hygiene perception of HCWs plays an important role in determining hand hygiene compliance.

The VZV vaccine contains a live attenuated strain, OKA.

Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) is a helpful molecular technique for the rapid identification of S. pneumoniae in positive blood cultures. There are many reports concerning the application of an enzymatic treatment with lysozyme in the FISH procedure for partial cell wall digestion of S. pneumoniae. However, this study was aimed to test the FISH procedure without enzymatic treatment for the identification of S. pneumoniae in blood culture specimens. Seventy-seven positive blood culture specimens containing Gram-positive cocci were examined by both the conventional laboratory methods and FISH. Detection of S. pneumoniae was performed by two FISH procedures: one procedure was performed with an enzymatic treatment step and the other one was done without enzymatic treatment. In addition, the specimens were tested by the FISH procedure with enzymatic treatment to detect Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus. The specificity of FISH in comparison with conventional culture methods was 100%. The sensitivity of the FISH procedure with enzymatic treatment for the detection of S. pneumoniae was 90%, whereas, the sensitivity of the FISH procedure without enzymatic treatment was 100%. In fact, by omission of enzymatic treatment, detection of S. pneumoniae was improved in 6 specimens. The results of the FISH and culture methods for the detection of S. pyogenes and Enterococcus were compatible. Altogether, FISH procedure without enzymatic treatment step seems to improve the detection of S. pneumoniae in some cases. Thus, for successful detection of S. pneumoniae, we suggest the application of both FISH procedures (the procedure with enzymatic treatment and the procedure without enzymatic treatment) for each blood culture specimen.",

Twelve plant species originated from a natural habitat of the fungus were supposed to be connected with T. terfezioides based on the anatomy of the endogenous fungal structures in their roots. Aseptic experiments were carried out on modified MMN substrates with different phosphate concentrations to study the interaction of T. terfezioides with Robinia pseudoacacia and Helianthemum ovatum. The colonization of the roots of black locust was always weaker than that of Helianthemum. The main characteristics were the intracellular coiled, branched, frequently septated hyphae in dead root cells. The intercellular hyphae formed Hartig-net with finger like structures only in Helianthemum, the interactions could not be considered unambiguously as mycorrhizae. There was no difference between the RFLP profiles of the nr DNA ITS of nineteen fruit bodies collected at the same time from the habitat and the ITS of three randomly chosen specimens were identical on sequence level, too. These invariability makes to design species specific PCR primers possible to check unambiguously the host plants.",

    "abstract": "Sensitive detection methods, such as DNA PCR and RNA PCR suggest that vertical transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) occurs at three major time periods; in utero, around the time of birth, and postpartum as a result of breastfeeding (Fig. 1). Detection of proviral DNA in infant's blood at birth suggests that transmission occurred prior to delivery. A working definition for time of infection is that HIV detection by DNA PCR in the first 48 h of life indicates in utero transmission, while peripartum transmission is considered if DNA PCR is negative the first 48 h, but then it is positive 7 or more days later [1]. Generally, in the breastfeeding population, breast milk transmission is thought to occur if virus is not detected by PCR at 3–5 months of life but is detected thereafter within the breastfeeding period [2]. Using these definitions and guidelines, studies has suggested that in developed countries the majority, or two thirds of vertical transmission occur peripartum, and one-third in utero [3–6]. The low rate of breastfeeding transmission is due to the practice of advising known HIV-positive mothers not to feed breast milk. However, since the implementation of antiretroviral treatment in prophylaxis of HIV-positive mothers, some studies have suggested that in utero infection accounts for a larger percentage of vertical transmissions [7]. In developing countries, although the majority of infections occurs also peripartum, a significant percentage, 10–17%, is thought to be due to breastfeeding [2, 8, 9].",

HSV-1 infection induced clinical signs of fever, motor hyperactivity and aggressive behavior. These manifestations were dependent on a permissive action of circulating glucocorticoids and not related to the degree of viral replication in the brain. Hyperthermia and HPA axis activation were also specifically dependent on HSV-1-induced brain IL-1 and PG-E2. The chronic neurological sequel or fatal outcome of HSV-1 encephalitis may be due to viral replication and brain tissue destruction, which are dependent on virus encoded virulence genes. In contrast, the clinical and behavioral signs in the acute phase are a result of activation of neurochemical systems, including cytokines, prostaglandinds and catecholamines. Circulating glucocorticoids play an essential role in mediating the physiologic actions of HSV-1-induced brain products and the clinical syndrome of encephalitis.",

The M2 protein from influenza A virus forms proton-selective, pH-regulated channel involved in regulating vesicular pH, a function important for the correct maturation of HA glycoprotein. The NB glycoprotein of influenza B viruses is an integral membrane protein with an ion channel activity. The CM2 protein of influenza C virus is an integral membrane glycoprotein structurally analogous to influenza A virus M2 and influenza B virus NB proteins.

Not surprisingly, GSH has been reported to inhibit the b-lactam biosynthetic machinery quite effectively and, hence, strategies to decrease the intracellular GSH concentrations without influencing negatively the physiological status of idiophasic mycelia would attract industrial interests. Here we present a detailed map of the GSH metabolic network of P. chrysogenum and show a promising way to keep the GSH pool selectively down under penicillin producing conditions. This procedure includes a well-controlled and transient lowering of pH at the beginning of the production phase, and it relies on the GSH-dependent detoxification of the protonophore penicillin side-chain precursors phenoxyacetic acid (POA) and phenylacetic acid (PA). Encouraging preliminary fed-batch fermentation experiments have been performed to test this technological proposal. Interestingly, the mechanism of the activation of POA and PA to the appropriate CoA derivatives has remained yet to be answered but the involvement of GSH seems to be rather unlikely in this case. Our data also challenge the hypothesis that the formation of different kinds of penicillins would be an alternative to GSH-dependent detoxification processes in P. chrysogenum.",

Animal gut represents one of the most complex microbial ecosystems with a large degree of microbial biodiversity present. Bacteria inhabiting the gut usually play important roles in metabolic transformations of substrates and sometimes, e.g. in ruminants, they make the basis for an obligate symbiosis with the host. Here we discuss molecular microbiology as a strategy for examination of gut bacteria, concentrating on a typical and in such environment dominant group of strictly anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria from the phylogenetic group Cytophaga/Flexibacter/Bacteroides. The bacteria from the genus Prevotella are the most abundant Gram-negative bacteria in the rumen and form a distinctive phylogenetic cluster, clearly separated from prevotellas isolated from other ecological niches. They may represent a good choice for a model organism in genetic manipulation experiments and for studies of gene transfer mechanisms taking place in the gut. The molecular tools for detection and monitoring of ruminal prevotellas are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Genomics provided biomedical scientists an inventory of all genes and sequences present in a living being. This provides an unique opportunity to the scientists to predict and study biological functions of these genes. The changes in the gene expression regulated by genomic sequences therefore reflect changes in the molecular processes working in a cell or tissue in response to external factors including exposure to toxic compounds and pathogens. Microarray offers a biotechnological revolution with the help of DNA chemistry, silicon chip technology and optics to be used to monitor gene expression for thousands of genes in one single experiment. Briefly, 20,000 to 100,000 unique DNA molecules get applied by a robot to the surface of silicon wafers (approximately the size of a microscope slide). Using a single microarray experiment, the expression level of 20,000 to 100,000 genes will be examined in one single experiment. Genomics and microarray have a significant role and impact on the design and development of modern detection and diagnostic tools in several different ways. Microarray tools are now used on regular basis for monitoring gene expression of large number of genes and also frequently applied to DNA sequence analysis, immunology, genotyping, and molecular diagnosing. For diagnostics, these tools can be used to distinguish and differentiate between different DNA fragments that differ by as little as a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). These microarrays can be divided based on the gene density spots that will be high density (≯10,000 spots) per slide, medium (<1000≯100) and low density (<100). High-density arrays have proven to be very useful in disease diagnosis especially in diagnosis and classification of different types of cancers. These microarray tools hold tremendous potential for pathogen detection, which will be comprised, of unique sets of genes (also referred to as “signatures”) able to unambiguously identify the species and strain of pathogens of interest.",

Lateral mobility of surface differentiation antigens (I2, CD19, CD20, and sIgM-kappa) were measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). The mean diffusion coefficients, D, values for two clones of IFN-alpha resistant Daudi cells were significantly higher (D = 8.1-11 x 10(-10) cm2/sec) than for parental sensitive cells (D = 4.9-7.4 x 10(-10) cm2/sec). Microviscosity of the plasma membranes were probed by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometry. These results also indicate a greater degree of molecular motional freedom in resistant cells. Treatment of sensitive lymphoblasts with IFN-alpha (100-400 U/10(6) cells) for 5-30 min consistently increased mean values of D and the degree of spin-probe motional freedom, whereas no significant differences were detected in resistant cells. The effect of IFN-alpha on the membrane potential (Em) of Daudi cells was quantitated by flow cytometry using a voltage-sensitive oxonol dye. Membrane potential of all clones was similar (-50 to -56 mV). Treatment with IFN-alpha for 8-10 min caused hyperpolarization in the sensitive cells (deltaEm up to 45 mV), but only minimal hyperpolarization in the resistant ones (deltaEm up to 7 mV). We concluded that sensitivity to IFN-alpha and treatment with IFN-alpha are related to the biophysical status of plasma membranes.",

Of 6,586 patients included, 15.8% (n = 1,041) were infected with brucellosis. The age of infected individuals ranged from five to 95 years, with an average of 35.1 ± 21.2 years. Most infected patients were male (72.3%). Young adults (26-44 years) were the most common age group with the disease (34.1%). The annual rate of infection significantly decreased (P < 0.0001) from 33.2% in 2015 to 12.5% in 2019. An escalating number of brucellosis cases was seen in the spring and peaked during the summer.

The interactive effect of four process parameters, i.e. lactose and soybean meal, inoculum size (spore concentration) and age of the spore culture, on the production of lovastatin was evaluated employing response surface methodology (RSM). The model highlighted the positive effect of soybean meal concentration and inoculum level for achieving maximal level of lovastatin (1342 mg/l). The optimal fermentation conditions improved the lovastatin titre by 7.0-folds when compared to the titres obtained under unoptimized conditions.",

    "abstract": "Until recently the etiology of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) was considered uniform. The infectious agent was thought to be a single strain of prion (posttranslationally altered form of normal prion protein: PrPSc) retaining its biochemical and biological characteristics during interspecies transmission. However, alternate PrPSc signatures through large-scale screening have recently been detected. In addition, genetic alterations governing susceptibility to prion infection and a mutation (E211K) capable of eliciting spontaneous BSE have been demonstrated. Thus, the spectrum of BSEs have broadened and three PrPSc variants (BSE-C, BSE-H and BSE-L) are now defined. Moreover, a new condition resembling BSE, idiopathic brainstem neuronal chromatolysis (IBNC), has been described that may also turn out to be a prion disease. Since one of the new BSE variants, L-type BSE, proved highly pathogenic detection and further characterization of the new conditions are essential.",

Our study investigated epidemiological characteristics, antibiotic sensitivity profile and resistance genes of imipenem resistant A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa . This was a retrospective study carried out in the bacteriology laboratory of Mohammed V military training hospital, spanning from January 2018 to April 2021. Antibiotic susceptibility was studied by Mueller Hilton agar diffusion method with OXOID® type antibiotic discs and interpreted according to the recommendations of EUCAST 2021. Carbapenemase detection was performed by CarbaNP-test®. The molecular study was performed using conventional PCR. During the study period, we collected 1,072 imipenem-resistant isolates namely, 820 A. baumannii and 252 P. aeruginosa . The molecular study showed that out of 108 A. baumannii isolates 102 carried the bla OXA-51 and 100 isolates carried the bla OXA-23 gene. The coexistence of bla OXA-23 and bla NDM genes was detected in only 4 isolates. Altogether 50% of P. aeruginosa strains carried bla VIM-2 . All investigated A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa strains were colistin susceptible in this study. Multiresistant bacterial infections are associated with longer hospitalization, higher hospital costs and higher mortality rates. Therefore, a collective action including the different actors of the healthcare system is necessary.",

Identification of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec), multilocus-sequence typing, and sequencing of S. aureus protein A (spa) gene are used for MRSA typing. The aim was to investigate the spa types of MRSA isolates in a tertiary hospital in Greece and analyse the whole genome sequences of two t127 MRSA isolates.Totally, 39 MRSA isolates collected from July 2019 to June 2020 in \"Georgios Gennimatas\" General Hospital of Thessaloniki, Greece, were included in the study. Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were performed using VITEK II automated system, and spa typing was performed. A minimum spanning tree was used to display the spa type frequencies and the genetic distances among them. Two t127-MRSA isolates (IM-MRSA and PD-MRSA) were selected for WGS.Six isolates (15.4%) were resistant to mupirocin, 18 (46.2%) to fusidic acid, three (7.7%) to vancomycin and two (5.1%) to teicoplanin. Twenty-two different spa types were detected, with t002, t003, and t422 being the most frequent (5/39, 12.8% each), followed by t1994 (4/39, 10.3%). The isolates presented high genetic diversity and, taking into account the time between hospital admission and sampling, intrahospital spread did not occur. Even the two t127 isolates were assigned to different sequence types, ST9-XII-t127 and ST1-IVa-t127. Plasmids and genes conferring antimicrobial resistance and virulence were also identified.Various spa types were identified and together with the information about the time between hospital admission and sampling supports polyclonal MRSA spread in the hospital excluding a nosocomial infection. WGS provides a more detailed analysis distinguishing even the isolates belonging to the same spa type.",

In recent years multidrug-resistant B2-ST131 E. coli clonal group has disseminated worldwide. The ST131 and its subclones H30 and H30-Rx have been identified only in a few studies from Turkey. The aim of this study is to investigate the presence of ST131 and its subclones and to analyze their adhesin virulence genes and antimicrobial resistance. A total of 250 urinary ExPEC isolates were included in the study. Resistance rates of 16 antimicrobial agents were determined by disk-diffusion. Multidrug-resistance and ESBL production were analyzed. Altogether 8 adhesin genes were investigated namely, papAH, fimH, sfa/focDE, focG, afa/draBC, iha, bmaE and gafD. A total of 39 ST131 isolate were determined and 33 (84.6%) were multidrug-resistant. ESBL production was detected in 34 (87.2%) ST131 and 61 (28.9%) of non-ST131 strains. In our study, we found a strong correlation between ST131 strains and fimH, iha, afa/draBC, papAH virulence determinants. Twenty-nine (85.3%) of 34 ST131-O25b-H30 isolates were identified as H30-Rx. All the papAH gene positive isolates were identified within ST131-O25b-H30-Rx lineage. Non-H30-Rx isolates within H30 isolates were identified as pattern 2. Almost 16% of the isolates were identified as ST131 regardless of clinical syndrome and approximately 34% of the multidrug-resistant isolates were H30-Rx subclone. We report H30-Rx as the dominant subclone of ST131 in our study. Imipenem, fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin proved to be the most effective agents according to antibiotic resistance patterns of both ST131 and non-ST131 E. coli strains.",

Eight different serotypes of Salmonella were identified: 6 S. saintpaul, 4 S. wien (1 from control), 2 S. newport, 2 S. muenchen (1 from control), 2 S. typhimurium (1 from control), 2 S. hadar (1 from control), 2 S. reading (1 from control), 1 S. kottbus. Twenty (95%) were positive in the invasiveness assay using HeLa cells, and all (100%) were negative for cytotoxin production in HT29 cells. More than 40% were resistant to ampicillin, cefalexin, cefamandole, cefoperazone, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, mezlocillin and trimethoprimsulphamethoxazole and 100% were susceptible to the new quinolones. Most (67%) of the strains harbored plasmids and 43% produced beta-lactamase. A strong association was observed between the presence of more than one plasmid, beta-lactamase activity, and multiple-resistance to antimicrobial agents and serotypes S. saintpaul and S. wien. Curing experiments with acridine orange showed that 2 plasmids (33 and 1.4 megadaltons) might be responsible for the resistance to chloramphenicol and gentamicin. The present study demonstrated that multiple-resistant salmonellae are widespread in Libya and the resistance is mainly plasmid mediated.",

Supplementing the plating medium with 5% NaCl did not influence the colony forming capacity of non-pressurised cells, however, CFU of residual populations after respective treatments of 300 MPa for 10 and 30 min were reduced by a further 2 and 3.5 log cycles in case of salt containing plates. Nisin-addition to the plating medium caused less than one log unit decrease in the CFU of the non-pressurised population. However, the CFU of 10 min-pressurised sample was 4 log cycles less in the nisin-containing plates than in the nisin-free ones, whereas no colonies were formed in the nisin-containing plates even when 1 ml was inoculated from the originally 1010 CFU/ml population after 300 MPa for 30 min. The luciferase activities (bioluminescence intensities) decreased concomitant with the reduction of the viable cell counts, however, they were approx. 0.6-0.8 log units less in the presence of 5% NaCl in the pressurised suspension than those expected from the previously established linear correlation between the logarithmic light outputs and the logarithmic viable cell counts.",

A live attenuated HSV-1 (deleted in the gE gene), and a HSV-1 (strain HSZP)-infected cell extract served as positive controls, and three non-structural recombinant HSV-1 fusion proteins (ICP27, UL9/OBP and thymidine kinase--TK) were used as presumed non-protective (negative) controls. Protection tests showed that the LD50 value of the challenging infectious virus increased 90-fold in mice immunized with ICP27, but remained unchanged in other control mice immunized with TK and OBP polypeptides. A significant protection (the LD50 value of challenging virus increased 800-fold) was noted following immunization with gD1/313, while immunization with the gE-del virus and/or the gD1 DNA vaccine resulted in a more than 4,000-fold increase of the challenging virus dose killing 50% of the animals. Using ELISA, elevated antibody titers were detected following immunizations with gD1/313, gE-del virus, and/or HSV-1-infected-cell extract. In addition, all of the three non-structural proteins elicited a good humoral response (with titres ranging from 1:16,000 to 1:128,000).

Peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) as well as splenocytes from mice immunized with gD1/313, gE-del virus, and gD1-plasmid responded in lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) to the presence of purified gD1/313 antigen. For PBLs, the most significant stimulation of thymidine incorporation was registered at a gD1/313 concentration of 5 microg/100 microl, while the splenocytes from DNA vaccine-immunized mice responded already at a concentration of 1 microg/100 microl.",

The diploid lymphoma cells released a retrovirus and were antigenic in young adult Swiss (YAS) mice. Small lymphoma cell inocula were rejected with immunity acquired against large inocula of lymphoma cells. Tissue sections revealed the \"starry sky\" configurations. In one of the tissue cultures set up from lymphoma #620, a cell line consisting of large round poly- or tetraploid cells arose and was referred to as lymphoma cell line #818. The #818 cells grew in suspension cultures and in the form of large, lethal ascitic tumors in YAS mice. Diploid #620 lymphoma cells stained for retroviral antigens; #818 cells stained both for retroviral antigens and immunoglobulins. Fluids withdrawn from #818 cultures neutralized the leukemia virus in spleen focus assays. Immunoglobulin precipitated from #818 suspension culture fluids strongly and specifically neutralized the leukemia virus. The growth of #620 or #818 cells in YAS mice treated with rabbit anti-lymphoma cell immune sera was strongly inhibited but culture fluids of #818 cells showed weak and insignificant inhibition against leukemia-lymphoma #620 (in one experiment, unpublished). In two experiments #620 lymphoma cells were co-inoculated with immune spleen cells into the peritoneal cavities of YAS mice. The immune spleen cells derived from mice that rejected #620 cell inocula or were actively immunized with a photodynamically inactivated mouse leukemia virus vaccine. In the peritoneal cavities of mice co-inoculated with #620 cells and immune spleen cells, clones of large round cells emerged with tetra- or polyploid chromosomal modes. These cells stained for leukemia viral antigens and immunoglobulins. When passaged in YAS mice these cells induced lethal ascites tumors. It was concluded as early as in 1968-69 that an immune plasma cell can fuse with a lymphoma cell, if the lymphoma cell expresses retroviral antigens against which the plasma cell is producing a specific antibody. Some human lymphoma-leukemia cells express retroviral antigens and/or budding retroviral particles, whether due to the acquisition of new env sequences by incomplete resident endogenous retroviral genomes or due to the entry of exogenous retroviruses into lymphopoietic stem cells. In the Discussion illustrations are provided for the human cell line #778 established from a patient with \"lymphosarcoma cell leukemia\" in 1966. The malignant cells released unidentified retrovirus-like particles and fused with one another and with reactive lymphoid cells of the host. It should be investigated further if human lymphoma-leukemia cells could fuse with an immune plasma cell of the host and thus alter the clinical course of the disease.",

Based on negative beta-globin results, 10 specimens were not eligible for further analysis. Oncogenic HPV types were detected in 278 specimens (39.8%). C. trachomatis was found only in six specimens (0.9%). In conclusion, concurrent C. trachomatis infection was uncommon and hence it was an improbable risk factor in cytologic atypia.",

The mechanism behind the avoidance of immune surveillance and the extent of cellular network interference achieved by adenovirus is still being uncovered and is predicted to have ramifications for the design of cancer therapeutics.",

In this study, two optimized constructs consisting of multi-epitopes DNA derived from three latency antigens Rv2029c, Rv2031c, and Rv2627c fused with or without light chain 3 (LC3) are synthetized. The immunogenicity effectiveness of two DNA constructs was evaluated in the mouse model.

The LC3-fused construct induced IFN-γ + CD8 + T cell population ( p &lt; 0.0001) compared with empty vector and BCG groups but could not induce the T cell population compared with construct without LC3. Importantly, LC3-fused DNA construct did not induce epitope-specific IL-4 and IL-10 from CD4 + and CD8 + T cell populations.

    "abstract": "Numerous reports have confirmed that increased macrolide use in the treatment of respiratory tract infection has contributed to the emergence of antibiotic resistance worldwide. Studies have also shown that pneumococcal vaccine can reduce pneumococcal resistance. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of co-resistance to penicillin and other antibiotics in macrolide-resistant (MR) non-invasive pneumococcal isolates and to evaluate serotype distribution in resistant strains in the pre-vaccine era in Serbia. About 80% of MR isolates expressed the MLS phenotype with very high resistance to both erythromycin and clindamycin. A total of 132 (84.1%) MR isolates were multiresistant, i.e., they were resistant to erythromycin, penicillin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole. Among 157 MR pneumococci, 11 different serotypes were found. Four serotypes, 19F, 14, 6B, and 23F, accounted for 77.7% of all MR pneumococcal isolates. Among isolates with the cMLS phenotype, serotypes 19F and 14 were predominant, whereas serotype 6A was the most common among those with the M phenotype, followed by 14. In conclusion, co-resistance to macrolides and penicillin in our non-invasive pneumococcal isolates is high. The majority of tested strains (∼80%) belonged to the four serotypes (19F, 14, 6B, and 23F) that are included in all conjugate vaccine formulations.",

We separated growth-affecting proteins (GEPs) from wild type of Mycobacterium bovis and ATCC strain of Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium. Our results showed that these mycobacteria-secreted GEPs are involved in biofilm formation, growth stimulatory, and inhibitory processes. Our findings suggest that GEP stimulated M. avium subsp. avium growth in vitro. Stimulation process was observed in mycobacteria affected with GEP extracted from M. avium subsp. avium. We found that both GEPs inhibited the growth of the M. bovis. Optical density measurement and visual analysis confirm that GEP plays an important role in biofilm formation process. Most of M. bovis GEP are associated with the type VII secretion and general secretion pathways. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying mycobacterial biofilm formation and growth-affecting processes and better characterization of mycobacterial proteins and their functions. It is noteworthy that this finding represents the first demonstration of GEP-mediated growth effects on a solid and liquid medium.",

Intraperitoneal cefepime was initiated but since antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed cephalosporin resistance, therapy was changed to intraperitoneal meropenem. Following the removal of peritoneal dialysis catheter, fever, abdominal distention, and vomiting were resolved. Piperacillin, aztreonam, and carbapenems can be used for empirical therapy. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing should be performed to guide the choice of treatment. Removal of peritoneal dialysis catheter is an important step of management of this infection.

S. clavata was identified by API ID20C AUX (BioMérieux, Brussels, Belgium), MALDI TOF (Bruker Daltonik, Germany), and ITS gene region sequencing. In vitro susceptibility tests were performed using Sensititre YeastOne (TREK Diagnostic System, East Grinstead, UK). During the study period, 4,736 fungi were isolated from various clinical samples and, S. clavata was identified in eight patients with underlying diseases namely, pancreatic neoplasma, acute myeloid leukaemie, follicular lymphoma, cholelithiasis. Anidulafungin and micafungin minimum inhibitory concentration values were 1–2 and 1–4 mg/L, respectively, while those of the azole group antifungals were much lower. This is the first study in Turkey reporting isolation, identification and antifungal susceptibilities of S. clavata from clinical specimens. Higher MIC values seen in some isolates suggest that continuous monitoring of sensitivity rates and observation of regional differences will thus be useful guides in determining infection control and antifungal use policies.",

Ceftaroline is a fifth generation cephalosporin binding and inhibiting penicillin binding protein (PBP2a). Methods In the present study, 228 clinical MRSA isolates were collected from four cities of Iran and their susceptibility to ceftaroline was evaluated by E-test and the disk diffusion method. Results Our results showed a high susceptibility rate (97.3%) to ceftaroline in MRSA strains from Iran. Six isolates were found to be ceftaroline non-susceptible (CPT-NS) with Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ≥2 µg/mL. All CPT-NS isolates were isolated from blood and tracheal aspirate and belonged to SCC mec type III as well as agr type I and were all susceptible to vancomycin. Out of six isolates, three, two and one belonged to spa type t030, t4864, and t969, respectively. Vancomycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, linezolid, chloramphenicol, and tigecycline were the most active agents against CPT-NS isolates. Conclusion Due to the broad-spectrum activity and low toxicity of ceftaroline as well as the increased rate of vancomycin resistance among MRSA strains in recent years, ceftaroline can be considered as a novel approach to treat MRSA-induced infections.",

    "abstract": "Despite concerted efforts, diagnosis of aspergillosis is still a great challenge to clinical microbiology laboratories. Along with the requirement for high sensitivity and specificity, species-specific identification is important. We developed rapid, sensitive and species-specific qPCR assays using the TaqMan technology for the detection and identification of Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus terreus . The assays were designed to target orthologs of the Streptomyces factor C gene that are only found in a few species of filamentous fungi. Fungi acquired this gene through horizontal gene transfer and divergence of the gene allows identification of species. The assays have potential as a molecular diagnosis tool for the early detection of fungal infection caused by Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus terreus , which merits future diagnostic studies. The assays were sensitive enough to detect a few genomic equivalents in blood samples.",

At first, the strains were cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA), then on modified Murashige and Skoog (MS*) solid agar media. A normal-growing strain was chosen for the trehalase induction experiments. During the trehalase induction treatment, mycelia were grown in liquid culture containing different concentrations of trehalose. After the induction period of trehalase enzymes, physiological state of the mycelium and the oxidative stress were monitored in the vegetative mycelia by measuring the change of the malondialdehyde content, superoxide dismutase enzyme activity, the fresh and dry weight. The examined Morchella conica strain utilized the trehalose properly. The rising amount of the trehalose triggered the increase of the mycelial trehalase enzyme activity. Our results clearly proved that both neutral and acidic trehalase isoenzyme activity of the Morchella conica mycelium are inducible and are playing important role in the utilization of external trehalose.",

Exogenous histamine markedly inhibited the ConA-induced ascites. Release of endogenous vasoactive agents from the mast cells by Compound 48/80 had a similar, but slight effect. Cromolyn, a mast cell stabilizing agent, and chloropyramine, a histamine H1 receptor antagonist was ineffective. Although histamine increases endothelial permeability, it did not enhance the formation of ascitic fluid, on the contrary, it inhibited the ConA-induced ascites, presumably due to its known hypotonic effect. It is concluded that ConA-induced ascites is not mediated by mast cell histamine.",

For species identification, as the reference method, API Candida test and species-specific PCR reactions were used. The potential of antifungal susceptibility testing by the ISYP test was compared with the Sensititre Yeast One. Whilst the reference methods confirmed that the received population (n = 65 isolates) represented only C. glabrata , identification with the ISYP system showed correct data only in the case of 18 strains tested (27.7%). Species identification of the other 47 strains with the ISYP test was not possible at all. Significant differences were also observed for drug susceptibility testing carried out by the ISYP and the Sensititre Yeast One. The highest level of disagreement in classifying strains as resistant or susceptible estimated, as 73.9% and 40.0%, was observed for itraconazole and amphotericin B, respectively. Satisfactory results were only obtained for 5-fluorocytosine with 93.8% agreement between both methods. In our opinion the idea of the ISYP system is certainly good. The combination of identification ability and drug susceptibility testing in one test is very important, especially from a clinical point of view. However, the current version of the ISYP has many disadvantages. We would like to encourage the manufacturer to make an effort and develop a new, more accurate version of the test.",

    "abstract": "Cystic hydatidosis (CH) is a worldwide distributed parasitic zoonosis. It is considered one of the 17 neglected parasitic tropical diseases, among cysticercosis and soil transmitted helminthiases. CH is caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus , a tapeworm that usually infects dogs and other carnivorous animals as definitive hosts and herbivorous animals and rarely humans as intermediate hosts. Main primary localizations are the liver and the lung. In less than 3% they can primarily be present in the spleen. Treatment is mainly surgical, in some cases resulting in reoccurrence. In this paper we present the case of a male 55 years old patient who underwent a surgical intervention on his spleen for a solitary hydatid cyst as primary localization. Fifteen years after the operation the patient presented macroscopic haematuria; routine laboratory findings presented soft eosinophilia, 5%, without any other modification. There was found no palpable tumour in the pelvis by rectal examination. Abdominal ultrasound investigation revealed a 2×1 cm formation in the urinary bladder at the base of the left bladder-wall and a retrovesical, inhomogeneous 10×10 cm tumour with multiple septa and transonic zones. Computed tomography (CT) scan strongly suggested the presence of a bladder tumour and a hydatid cyst. The symptoms caused by the bladder tumour revealed the co-existing non-symptomatic retrovesical secondary CH, which is a rare complication of splenic Echinococcus granulosus infection. Close follow-up and a proper pre- and postoperative anti-parasitic medication of the patient could have prevented reoccurrence of CH.",

All the 21 isolates were authenticated as pseudomonads by a genus-specific PCR screening. The molecular diversity of these isolates was investigated by Amplified Ribosomal DNA Restriction Analysis (ARDRA) and the dendrogram obtained from the analysis revealed that all the 21 isolates clustered into seven groups. Further, these isolates were screened for plant growth promoting activities such as diazotrophy (PCR amplification of nifH gene and acetylene reduction assay), Indole acetic acid (IAA) and siderophore production (spectrometrically), 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase for ethylene regulation (PCR screening), mineral solubilization (biochemically) and antagonistic potential against soil pathogenic fungi (dual culture assay). Based on the results, two elite Pseudomonas isolates (S9 and O3) were chosen as multi-functional plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria, paving way for potential use as bioinoculants in rice.",

The aim of this study was to determine the sequence of carD gene in drug susceptible and resistant clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis and designing of a PCR assay based on carD sequence for rapid detection of this bacterium.Specific primers for amplification of carD gene were carefully designed, so that whole sequence of gene could be amplified; therefore primers were positioned at the upstream (promoter of this gene and ispD gene) and downstream (in ispD gene). DNA from 41 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis with different pattern of drug resistance was used in the study. PCR conditions and annealing temperature were designed by means of online programs. PCR products were sequenced by ABI system.PCR product of carD gene was a 524 bp fragment. This method could detect all resistant and susceptible strains of M. tuberculosis. The size of amplified fragment was similar in all investigated samples. Sequence analysis showed that there was similar sequence in all of our isolates therefore probably this gene is considered to be conservative. Translation of nucleotide mode to amino acids was showed that TRCF domain in N-terminal of protein CarD was found to be fully conservative.This is the first study on the sequence of carD gene in clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis. This conservative gene is recommended for use as a target for designing of suitable inhibitors as anti-tuberculosis drug because its importance for life of MTB.

L-NAME, an inhibitor of NO synthesis, and atropine methylnitrate, an anticholinergic compound, were ineffective. It is concluded, that the kallikrein/kinin system contributes to the mediation of the ConA-induced ascites by increasing subperitoneal vascular permeability, independent of the eventual vasodilation produced by NO. It is known, that membrane glycoproteins are aggregated by the tetravalent ConA and the resulting distortion of membrane structure may explain the activation of the labile prekallikrein.

[1].The Fusarium spp.most frequently found associated with banana crown and fruit rot are Fusarium verticillioides and Fusarium musae [1,6].Of interest is that F. musae, i.e., a species that has been classified since 2011 as a separate species from F. verticillioides [6], was found to be not only a banana pathogen, but also an opportunistic human pathogen [7].Whereas the latter was already a long time well established for F. verticillioides, i.e., a species that has also a much broader plant host range (mostly found on maize), this was only recently reported for F. musae [7].This in itself is not surprising, since the species was only classified in 2011.However, retrospective and clinical studies showed that human pathogenic F. musae infections, both superficial and invasive, may occur more frequently than we might think [7][8][9][10].Because banana fruits are the only known natural habitat of F. musae and all",

Cell wall pillar density and width of the basidiospores also differ from that of regarded to be characteristic toG. lucidum. Although according to several authors chlamydospore formation is a characteristic feature ofG. lucidumit has not been observed in mycelial cultures of the Hungarian strains.Antagonistic reactions between the Hungarian and Far EasternG. lucidumisolates were mostly similar to the interspecific reactions between the two speciesG. lucidumandG. applanatumand corresponded only in a few cases to the interactions within one species.Our results suggest that the Hungarian strains significantly differ from the Far Eastern strains. To determine the taxonomic degree of this divergence genetical examinations should be carried out.",

The inorganic sulphur source, sulphate, is taken up by the cells via the sulphate-permease(s). After its transport, it is activated and subsequently reduced to sulphide or serves as a donor for sulphurylation reactions. Selenate anion (SeO4(2-)), which has the same metabolic pathway as sulphate, is toxic for the cells of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We isolated selenate resistant mutants which cannot utilize sulphate, therefore they need organic sulphur source for growth. One of the selenate resistant mutants was successively transformed with S. pombe genomic libraries and the gene complementing the selenate resistance was identified as that of coding for the ATP-sulphurylase enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Calcium plays an important role in the regulation of different functions of keratinocytes. In the present work we studied the effect of different extracellular calcium concentrations (0.01 mM-2.0 mM) on the proliferation and differentiation of human keratinocytes in normal human and non-lesional psoriatic skin. Using explant culture model, the proliferative and differentiated subsets of keratinocytes were detected by specific antibodies related to cell proliferation [beta-1 integrin (CD29), proliferating cell antigen (Ki67), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)] and differentiation [differentiated cell cytokeratins (K1/K10) and differentiating cell antigen (lectin Ulex europaius agglutinin, UEA-1)]. After 4 days of culturing at high Ca2+ (2.0 mM) we observed marked hyperproliferation among the normally quiescent keratinocytes of non-lesional psoriatic skin. In normal uncultured and cultured skin and in uncultured and two-day-cultured non-lesional psoriatic skin both at normal (1.2 mM) and at high (2.0 mM) Ca2+ concentration only one layer of basal CD29+/Ki67+/K1/K10-/UEA-1- cell was observed. In sections from non-lesional psoriatic skin cultured for 4 days in the presence of high Ca2+ (2.0 mM) this cell population has expanded from at least three layers above the basement membrane. This expanded cell population of the 4-day high Ca2+ cultured non-lesional skin showed clear PCNA positive staining on frozen sections with the strongest positivity among the most basal localized cells. These data suggest that (i) extracellular Ca2+ concentration can influence the proliferation of basal (\"stem\") keratinocytes, (ii) the proliferative response to high Ca2+ concentration of psoriatic non-lesional basal keratinocytes differs from that of normal basal keratinocytes, (iv) changes in the extracellular Ca2+ milieu might play a role in the induction of the hyperproliferative psoriatic lesion.",

The only measurable effect wind perse actually had on spore count, was registered when a strong wind blew after a long windless period. We observed that the count of ascospores during wet weather could surpass the total concentration of dry conidia measured on a typical, highly polluted summer day. Using selected air samples to study the effect of storms, certain aspects of long-distance spore transport were elucidated. We describe here three main strategies for long-range ascospore transport, \"splash-off\", \"secondary emission\" and \"sporematrix projectiles\".",

In syntitium inhibition assay on MT-2 human T-cell line UD29 prevented cell fusion and formation of syntitia induced by HIV-1IIIB with IC50 values of 11.7 μg/ml. In a single-cycle viral infection assay (MAGI assay) UD29 proved to have a potent inhibitory effect against HIV-1IIIB on HeLaCD4-LTR/β-gal cells, which was dose dependent with IC50 values of 4.75 μg/ml and IC90 of 39.7 μg/ml. UD29 showed a most prominent antiviral effect when administered 30 min prior HIV-1 infection. As HIV entry requires thiol/disulfide exchange process, results suggest that reactive -SH group of enol-form of the thiolated nucleotide may interfere with the function of cell surface proteins. UD29 cannot penetrate into cells and may have an interactive role in redox processes active in viral entry.",

Contradictory data were observed concerning the appearance of anti-IFN antibodies and the outcome of IFN therapy. A significantly higher number of the patients with a sustained response to rIFN-alpha2b therapy formed antibodies than the number among the non-responder patients. At the same time, in the patients treated with rIFN-alpha2a, opposite data were found. The activity of the antibodies in some sera was studied against the antiproliferative effect of IFNs on Daudi cells by measuring the [3H]thymidine incorporation. The binding antibodies without neutralization of the antiviral effect of the IFNs inhibited the antiproliferative activity of the rIFNs, similarly to antibodies having both IFN-binding and antiviral effect-neutralizing capacities. At the same time, the antiproliferative effect of the natural IFN was less affected. It is suggested that the antiproliferative assay is more sensitive than the antiviral method for demonstration of the presence of antibodies exerting an inhibitory effect on the biological activities of IFN.",

    "abstract": "Chicken embryonic cells (CEC) are nonpermissive hosts for the replication of human adenoviruses, yet they respond to infection by producing interferon (IFN). The nature of the IFN inducer moiety in these viruses has been elusive since its initial study by Ilona Béládi and colleagues some 40 years ago. We tested the hypothesis that viral dsRNA was the IFN inducer molecule - for two reasons: (i) dsRNA has been identified as a potent inducer of IFN, and (ii) developmentally mature CEC cells as cultured in vitro can develop a hyper-responsive state to dsRNA such that a single molecule of dsRNA per cell constitutes the threshold of detection. Furthermore, the number of particles in a virus population capable of inducing-IFN, irrespective of their replication capacity, can be quantified through the analysis of dose (multiplicity)-response (IFN yield) curves, thus allowing a determination of the number particles in virus populations that possess the capacity to induce IFN. This study demonstrates that type 5 wild type adenovirus (Ad5) and mutants dl312, dl334, and ts19 induce from 8,000 to 80,000 IFN U per 107 CEC. UV irradiation showed that transcription of about 20-50% of the Ad5 genome was required to produce the IFN inducer moiety. The ratio of IFN-inducing particles to plaque-forming particles (IFP: PFP) was as low as 1:6, indicating that only a small fraction of the total particles in a virus population ever function as IFP. We conclude that adenovirus dsRNA produced during symmetric transcription of some regions of the viral genome, coupled with fine-tuning of the IFN-induction pathway, account for the IFN-inducing capacity of adenoviruses in the non-permissive chicken cell.",

The aims of this study are to determine the molecular epidemiology and the simultaneous detection of bacterial meningitis in Morocco by using RT-PCR and compared this molecular approach with culture method to improve the etiological diagnosis of meningitis. The CSFs were collected over one-year period in 2018 in different hospitals covering all regions of the Kingdom of Morocco, from patients with suspected meningitis. The results showed the confirmation rate per culture recorded a rate of 33% and the RT-PCR of 70%. Molecular epidemiology is predominant of Neisseria meningitidis followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae and a dramatic reduction in meningitis due to Haemophilus influenzae following the introduction of conjugate vaccine in 2007. Also, the epidemiological profile shows a sex ratio M/F of 1.4 and a median age of 2 years. The national distribution showed a predominant of meningococcal disease followed by pneumococcal disease, especially a dominance of N. meningitidis over S. pneumoniae in two regions and a slight predominance of S. pneumoniae in the other two regions over N. meningitidis. Our research shows that culture in our country has less sensitivity and specificity than RT-PCR in diagnosis of bacterial meningitis and that molecular biology technique at bacteriology laboratories is desirable for diagnosis, early management of meningitis cases and in the context of the surveillance of meningitis in Morocco in parallel with culture.",

An increased number of metallo-β-lactamase (MBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae strains isolated in a tertiary hospital in Thessaloniki, Greece, called for further genetic investigation. The study included 29 non-repetitive carbapenem resistant K. pneumoniae isolates phenotypically characterized as MBL-producers collected in a tertiary hospital in Greece. The isolates were screened for the detection of carbapenemase genes ( K. pneumoniae carbapenemase ( bla KPC ), Verona-integron-encoded MBL-1 ( bla VIM-1 ), imipenemase ( bla IMP ), oxacillinase-48 ( bla OXA-48 ) and New Delhi MBL ( bla NDM )). The genetic relationship of the isolates was determined by Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. The whole genome sequences (WGS) from two NDM-positive K. pneumoniae isolates were further characterized. The presence of New Delhi MBL ( bla NDM ) gene was confirmed in all K. pneumoniae isolates, while bla KPC and bla VIM-1 genes were co-detected in one and two isolates, respectively. The RAPD analysis showed that the isolates were clustered into two groups. The whole genome sequence analysis of two K. pneumoniae isolates revealed that they belonged to the sequence type 11, they carried the bla NDM-1 gene, and exhibited differences in the number and type of the plasmids and the resistant genes. All MBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates of the study harbored a bla NDM gene, while WGS analysis revealed genetic diversity in resistance genes. Continuous surveillance is needed to detect the emergence of new clones in a hospital setting, while application of antimicrobial stewardship is the only way to reduce the spread of multi-resistant bacteria.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of our study was to investigate the epidemiology of coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) responsible for bacteremia in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients and to determine the prevalence and the genetic background of methicillin resistance. The prevalence of CoNS bacteremia was 7.4% (54/728), higher in allograft (10.7%) than in autograft (4.7%) recipients. A sepsis or a septic shock were observed in 9% of cases. No deaths were attributable to CoNS bacteremia. The methicillin resistance rate was 81%. All MR-CoNS, harbored mecA gene and 90% were typeable with SCCmec typing using PCR amplification. The SCCmec type IV was the most frequent (44%). Clonal dissemination of MR- Staphylococcus epidermidis strains was limited. Our study showed a low prevalence and favorable outcome of CoNS bacteremia in HSCT recipients with limited clonal diffusion. However, they were associated with a significant rate of severe infections and a high rate of methicillin resistance, mediated by SCCmec IV element in most cases.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Infection of the urinary tract ranks as one of the most common infections affecting people worldwide and its treatment is made complicated by the rising incidence of antibiotic resistance. This study aimed to detect extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes and antibiotic resistance profile of uropathogenic Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) recovered from patients attending a University Teaching hospital in Nigeria. Uropathogenic E. coli isolates were obtained from the culture collection of Department of Microbiology and Parasitology of the University Teaching hospital for a period of four months (October 2019–January, 2020). Antibiotic susceptibility testing was done using the disc diffusion method while phenotypic ESBL production was detected using double disc synergy test (DDST). Detection of β-lactamase genes was done using Real-Time PCR. Forty-nine E. coli isolates were recovered from 120 urine samples, with 24 (49%) being ESBL positive. The resistance to antibiotics in the ESBL producers was: ciprofloxacin (100%), cefotaxime (100%), cefpodoxime (100%), tetracycline (95.7%), ceftazidime (56.7%), amoxicillin-clavulanate (50%), gentamicin (33.3%), and imipenem (0%). All the ESBL producers carried bla TEM , bla CTX-M-1 and bla CTX-M-9 , 75% (18/24) carried bla SHV , while bla CTX-M-2 , bla CTX-M-8 and bla CTX-M-25 groups were detected in 20.8% (5/24) of the isolates. There was co-occurrence of CTX-M, SHV and TEM β-lactamases in 79.2% (19/24) isolates, while five isolates (20.8%) co-harbored bla CTX-M and bla TEM . This study showed a high level of multidrug resistance and ESBL gene carriage in uropathogenic E. coli obtained in this study, suggesting a likely review of therapeutic options in the treatment of UTI to clamp down on the rising cases of antibiotic resistance.",

Aim of the present study was to analyse the whole genome sequences of two MRSA strains belonging to Staphylococcus protein A (spa) type t127 isolated from humans working in two distantly located dairy production farms in Greece. MRSA strains were isolated from the nasal cavity of a food handler in a milk industry in Epirus, northwestern Greece (E-MRSA), and a person working in a cattle farm in Thrace, northeastern Greece (T-MRSA). Whole genome sequences taken using next generation sequencing were analysed for resistance and virulence genes applying various bioinformatic tools. Both isolates were assigned to ST1-IVa-t127 type, and they were transferring genes conferring resistance to tetracycline, β-lactams, and aminoglycosides; T-MRSA was carrying additional genes leading to macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin B (MLS B ) resistance. Both isolates were carrying three plasmid replicon types, rep5, rep7 and rep16, while T-MRSA harboured also rep10 and rep15. E-MRSA carried scn and sak genes which were absent from T-MRSA. In conclusion, the genetic characterization of two unrelated ST1-IVa-t127 MRSA strains isolated from humans in close contact with livestock in Greece can be used as basis for further epidemiological and evolutionary studies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection can both lead to severe cytokine release syndrome (sCRS) resulting in critical illness and death. In this single institution, preliminary comparative case-series study we compared clinical and laboratory co-variates as well as response to tocilizumab (TCZ)-based therapy of 15 allogeneic-HSCT- and 17 COVID-19-associated sCRS patients. Reaction to a TCZ plus posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCY) consolidation therapy in the allogeneic-HSCT-associated sCRS group yielded significantly inferior long-term outcome as compared to TCZ-based therapy in the COVID-19-associated group ( P = 0.003). We report that a TCZ followed by consolidation therapy with a Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) inhibitor given to 4 out of 8 critically ill COVID-19 patients resulted in their complete recovery. Non-selective JAK/STAT inhibitors influencing the action of several cytokines exhibit a broader effect than TCZ alone in calming down sCRS. Serum levels of cytokines and chemokines show similar changes in allogeneic-HSCT- and COVID-19-associated sCRS with marked elevation of interleukin-6 (IL-6), regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and interferon γ -induced protein 10 kDa (IP-10) levels. In addition, levels of IL-5, IL-10, IL-15 were also elevated in allogeneic-HSCT-associated sCRS. Our multi-cytokine expression data indicate that the pathophysiology of allogeneic-HSCT and COVID-19-associated sCRS are similar therefore the same clinical grading system and TCZ-based treatment approaches can be applied. TCZ with JAK/STAT inhibitor consolidation therapy might be highly effective in COVID-19 sCRS patients.",

    "abstract": "For many years, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) have been considered non-pathogenic bacteria. However, recently, CoNS are becoming more common bacteriological factors isolated from cases of chronic rhinosinusitis in humans. Moreover, most of them represent the multidrug-resistant or/and methicillin-resistant profile, which significantly increases the therapeutic difficulties. The aim of the study was to characterize profile of resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from cases of chronic rhinosinusitis in patients treated in a Medical Center in Warsaw in 2015-2016. The study material was derived from patients with diagnosed chronic rhinosinusitis treated at the MML Medical Center in Warsaw. The material was obtained intraoperatively from maxillary, frontal, and ethmoid sinuses. In total, 1,044 strains were isolated from the studied material. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were predominant, with the largest share of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Isolated CoNS were mainly resistant to macrolide, lincosamide, and tetracycline. Among the S. epidermidis strains, we also showed 35.6% of MDR and 34.7% of methicillin-resistant strains. The same values for other non-epidermidis species were 31.5% and 18.5%, respectively and the percentage of strains with MAR >0.2 was greater in S. epidermidis (32.6%) than S. non-epidermidis (23.9%). Although the percentage of strains resistant to tigecycline, glycopeptides, rifampicin and oxazolidinones was very small (2.3%, 1.9%, 1.4% and 0.7% respectively), single strains were reported in both groups. The study has shown a high proportion of MDR and methicillin-resistant CoNS strains, which indicates a large share of drug-resistant microorganisms in the process of persistence of chronic rhinosinusitis; therefore, isolation of this group of microorganisms from clinical cases using aseptic techniques should not be neglected.",

Variability of microbial communities was assessed by cultivation-based [nitrifying, denitrifying most probable number (MPN) heterotrophic plate count] and sequence-aided terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis. The effect of microbial community composition on nitrifying MPN values was revealed. The non-treated well water samples showed remarkable differences to their corresponding distribution systems regarding low plate count, nitrifying MPN, and the composition of microbial communities, which increased and changed, respectively, in distribution systems. Environmental factors, such as pH, total inorganic nitrogen content (ammonium and nitrite concentration), and chlorine dioxide treatment had effect on microbial community compositions. The revealed heterogeneous nitrifying population achieved remarkable nitrification, which occurred at low ammonium concentration (14-51 μM) and slightly alkaline pH 7.7-7.9 in chlorine dioxide disinfected water networks. No change was observed in nitrification-generated nitrate concentration, although nitrate-reducing (and denitrifying) bacteria were present with low MPN and characterized by sequence-aided T-RFLP. The community structures of water samples partially changed in nitrifying enrichments and had influence on the generated nitrifying, especially nitrite-oxidizing MPN regarding the facilitated growth of nitrate-reducing bacteria and even methanogenic archaea beside ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria.",

    "abstract": "In the past decade, Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs) have become a major public health challenge. Their epidemiology has radically changed with a significant rise in the number of cases and an increase in severe episodes. Recurrence and failure of conventional treatments are very common. Furthermore, a spread of CDI has emerged in general population without the usual risk factors (unexposed to antibiotic treatment, young people, etc.). The conventional treatments (metronidazole and vancomycin) are still effective and are the first-line antibiotics with new recommendations. New therapeutic strategies are now available. Recent studies show a better efficacy of vancomycin compared with metronidazole for severe episodes. Fidaxomicin is a novel antibiotic drug with an efficacy similar to vancomycin and a lower risk of recurrence. Finally, for relapsing forms, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) seems to be the best option. We determined risk factors for CDI among patients treated at the infectious diseases ward of our hospital in Pécs. The study included 886 patients with CDI from 2009 to 2014. The average number of recurrent episodes was 2.16 and the proportion of severe cases was 66%. Among our patients, 726 (82%) had taken antibiotics and 769 (86.8%) had been hospitalized in the prior 3 months before developing CDI. We have found that prior statin use could be a significant risk factor of CDI (OR: 1.7765, 95% CI: 1.3966-2.2597, p < 0.0001). Finally, we present the comparative efficacy of different types of treatment (metronidazole, vancomycin, fidaxomicin, and FMT).",

A microarray containing 59 probes for detecting mRNA of members of TGFB1-associated pathways was developed. mRNA expression of TGFB1 receptors and members of connected pathways were examined in peripheral blood leukocytes of patients during acute EBV infection and after recovery. TGFB1 and TGFBR2 mRNA expression was increased in patients with EBV infection. Similarly, mRNA expression of protein kinase C ( PRKCB ), MAP3K7, PDLIM7 , and other members of TGFB1 and NF-κB signaling pathways increased. A shift of mRNA transcript variant expression of some key members ( TGFBR2, PRKCB , and NFKBIB ) of involved signaling pathways was detected. After the patients’ recovery, most of the altered mRNA expression has been normalized. We speculate that in patients with EBV infection, members of TGFB1-associated pathways contribute to the suppression of proapoptotic and induction of pro-survival factors in leukocytes. The modulation of TGFB1-associated pathways may be considered as a potential risk factor in the development of EBV-associated tumors in patients with acute EBV infection.",

The tested antigen comprises the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins ESAT6 and CFP10 as well as modified human γ-interferon (dIFN) for boosting the immune response. Double intradermal immunization of guinea pigs with the tested fusion protein (2 × 0.5 µg) induces a protective effect against subsequent Mtb infection. The immunized guinea pigs do not develop the symptoms of acute TB and their body weight gain was five times more as compared with the non-immunized infected guinea pigs. The animal group immunized with this dose of antigen displays the minimum morphological changes in the internal organs and insignificant inflammatory lesions in the liver tissue, which complies with a decrease in the bacterial load in the spleen and average Mtb counts in macrophages.",

We introduce an appropriate stochastic variable into a mathematical model and prove that this assumption is suitable to describe the CT vs. BL graph in a wild-type fission yeast population. In a double mutant of fission yeast (namely wee1-50 cdc25 D ) this CT vs. BL plot is even more curious: cycle time splits into three different values resulting in three clusters in this coordinate system. We show here that it is possible to describe these quantized cycles by choosing the appropriate values of the key parameters of mitotic entry and exit and even more the clustered behavior may be simulated by applying a further stochastic parameter.",

In one strain the results obtained using the classical methods did not coincide with those using the API 20 Strep method. 3 strains (12.5%) could not be identified using the API 20 Strep system. However, 11 strains (45%), that remained doubtful between both species E. faecalis and E. faecium on the basis of the classical methods, were identified using the API 20 Strep system. The API 20 Strep system does not include some biochemical tests of importance in identifying of foodborne enterococci and could not identify the atypical strains of Enterococcus. Moreover, this system is adapted to the identification of enterococci of clinical origin and their database does not include some species common in foods. However, it could have an application in combination with the classical methods in order to carry out a reasonably rapid and reliable identification of enterococci related to cheese.",

Though many important wetland ecological functions are based on microbial metabolism, we have scanty knowledge on microbial diversity in wetlands. Plant rhizoplane habitats are considered to harbor highly diverse bacterial communities. Most of the floating mats on river Nile are dominated by papyrus (Cyperus papyrus). Papyrus root samples were collected from a floating mat at the \"Gold Island\" inside the Nile River at Cairo, Egypt in February 1996 and May 1997 in order to investigate the rhizoplane actinobacteria communities. The root-tip regions were cut off, repeatedly washed, macerated and plated. Using the plate-count technique with three actinobacteria media, an average of 2.1 x 10(4) CFUg-1 root actinobacteria were obtained. All actinobacteria colonies were isolated, purified and investigated by classical and molecular methods. In the papyrus rhizoplane Streptomyces anulatus, Micromonospora sp., Rhodococcus luteus, Verrucosispora gifhornensis and Aureobacterium liquefaciens dominated, moreover Actinoplanes utahensis, and Str. diastaticus were also present. The physiological traits of the members of dominant groups revealed that these bacteria might be active in the rhizoplane and can be present there is their vegetative forms.",

This work aims to compare antimicrobial-resistance results of animal isolates considering CLSI and EUCAST guidelines. The comparison shows considerable differences in the results, which include antibiotics used as primary options in hospital infections. EUCAST showed the higher number of samples with resistance profiles than CLSI that indicates a more efficient scenario to the EUCAST to screen antibiotic-resistant bacteria. EUCAST was more consonant to the expected phenotype for ESBL producers, with higher index of resistance to oxyimino-beta-lactam antibiotics. The study shows that there are differences in the interpretative results using different guidelines, where the susceptibility test results concerning Enterobacteriaceae of animal origin are not always coincident in CLSI and EUCAST. EUCAST has proved to be the most reliable alternative for profile screening of antibiotic resistance, when compared to CLSI. We might say the same with respect to the ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae , in which EUCAST has proved to be more efficient about the demonstration of expected resistance profiles for the ESBL producers. These differences show that guideline selection might influence the therapeutic option.",

C. difficile is the etiologic agent of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, pseudomembranous enterocolitis, and toxic megacolon while CDIs recur in 7.9% of patients. About 42.9 CDI cases/10,000 patient-days are diagnosed each day in Europe, whereas in Poland 5.6 CDI cases/10,000 patient-days are reported; however, the median for European countries is 2.9 CDI cases/10,000 patient-days. Epidemiology of CDIs has changed in recent years and risk of developing the disease has doubled in the past decade that is largely determined by use of antibiotics. Studies show that rate of antibiotic consumption in the non-hospital sector in Poland is much higher than the European average (27 vs. 21.8 DDD/1,000 patient-days), and this value has increased in recent years. Antibiotic consumption has also increased in the hospital sector, especially in the intensive care units – 1,520 DDD/1,000 patient-days (ranging from 620 to 3,960 DDD/1,000 patient-days) – and was significantly higher than in Germany 1,305 (ranging from 463 to 2,216 DDD/1,000 patient-days) or in Sweden 1,147 (ranging from 605 to 2,134 DDD/1,000 patient-days). The recent rise in CDI incidence has prompted a search for alternative treatments. Great hope is placed in probiotics, bacteriocins, monoclonal antibodies, bacteriophages, and developing new vaccines.",

Its first case was reported in China by the end of 2019, but its exponential spread has wrapped entire globe, suspended and is penalizing mankind. A retrospective meta-analysis study showed that outbreaks of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and SARS-Cov-1 (Coronaviridae), influenza infection H1N1 and West-African Ebola caused lower mortality than this new pandemic COVID-19. Virus has appeared as a new human pathogen so to counter COVID-19 no specific vaccine, monoclonal antibodies have been manufactured till day. The outbreak of novel Coronavirus is treated with antimicrobial drugs but they have their own mild side effects. But the drastic spread of COVID-19 compels us also to use other ways to counter pandemic. Thus, passive immunization can be opted to hold back this mysterious virus. Passive immunization has been in use since early 20th century and showed its effectiveness against all previous infectious outbreaks including MERS and SARS-Cov-1 members of Coronaviridae. The review argues that convalescent plasma is an explicit option for containment of COVID-19 disease.",

This was demonstrated using animal experiments as well, as comparative statistical methods (in human cases). However, there is no explanation for the tools of memorization (even after decades) of the early adversity and the tools of execution (manifestation) in adult age. It seems likely that immune memory is involved to the memorization of early adversity, up to the manifestation of the result (non-communicable diseases). Nevertheless, the relatively short timespan of adaptive immune memory makes this system insuitable for this function, however the newly recognized trained memory of the innate immune system seems to be theoretically suitable for the storage of the records and handling the sequalae, which is the epigenetic reprogramming in the time of provocation, without changes in base sequences (mutation). The flawed (damaged) program is manifested later, in adult age. Evidences are incomplete, so further animal experiments and human observations are needed for justifying the theory.",

The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence and clinical implications of HPV16 infection in oral squamous cell carcinoma in population of Montenegro. This study included 60 patients with OSCC (localized on the lower lip, tongue or/and floor of the mouth), surgically treated at the Clinical Centre of Montenegro from 2012 to 2018. Surgically obtained formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded specimens were used for histopathological analysis and HPV16 genome detection using standard Polymerase Chain Reaction (primers for detection of E6 gene). Each individual was further followed up for the period of three years and for different clinico-pathological characteristics, including disease free interval (DFI). The prevalence of HPV16 infection in OSCCs was 23.3% and the infection was significantly more common in female patients ( P = 0.038). No significant correlation was detectable between HPV16 infection and the patients' age ( P = 0.302), tumor site ( P = 0.125), tumor grade ( P = 0.363) and disease stage ( P = 0.995). Observing the total sample the DFI was not significantly different for HPV16-positive versus HPV16-negative patients ( P = 0.427), but a gender-based difference in DFI was observed, with the significantly shorter DFI (Log Rank test, P = 0.003) in HPV16 positive female patients compared to male patients ( P = 0.003).

In vitro effect of different antibiotic combinations against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were evaluated in this study.Meropenem-tobramycin (MER+TOB), meropenem-ciprofloxacin (MER+CIP), colistin-meropenem (COL+MER), colistin-ciprofloxacin (COL+CIP) and colistin-tobramycin (COL+TOB) combinations were tested by time kill-assays. Each antibiotic alone and in combination at their Cmax values were tested against 4 clinical K. pneumoniae isolates at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h. Effect of colistin and its associations were also assessed at 30 min. Bactericidal activity was defined as ≥3log10 CFU mL-1 decrease compared with initial inoculum. Synergy was defined as ≥2log10CFU mL-1 decrease by the combination compared with the most active single agent. Presence of blaOXA-48, blaNDM, blaVIM, blaIMP, blaKPC and blaCTX-M-1 genes was screened by PCR using specific primers.The blaOXA-48 gene was identified together with blaCTXM-1 group gene in all isolates. COL+MER demonstrated to be synergistic and bactericidal. MER+TOB showed synergistic and bactericidal effect on two strains although, regrowth was seen on other two strains at 24 h. MER+CIP exhibited indifferent effect on the strains.Combination therapy could be a potential alternative to treat MDR K. pneumoniae infections. This combination might prevent resistance development and secondary effects of colistin monotherapy. MER+TOB and MER+CIP might have an isolate-dependent effect, that may not always result in synergism.",

The present study aimed to explore the colistin resistance mechanisms of a Klebsiella aerogenes (formerly Enterobacter aerogenes) isolate (Kae1177-1bg) obtained from a Bulgarian critically ill patient with septic shock in 2020. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and whole-genome sequencing using DNA nanoball technology were performed. The resulting read pairs were used for draft genome assembly, MLST analysis and mutation screening in the pmrA/B, phoP/Q, and mgrB genes. Kae1177-1bg demonstrated high-level resistance to colistin, resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins and susceptibility to all other antibiotics tested. In our strain a CMY-2-type class C cephalosporinase was the only β-lactamase identified. No mobile colistin resistance (mcr) genes were detected. A total of three missense variants in the genes for the two-component PmrA/PmrB system were identified. Two of them were located in the pmrB (pR57K and pN275K) and one in the pmrA gene (pL162M). The pN275K variant emerged as the most likely cause for colistin resistance because it affected a highly conservative position and was the only nonconservative amino acid substitution. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented clinical case of a high-level colistin-resistant K. aerogenes in Bulgaria and the first identification of the nonconservative amino acid substitution pN275K worldwide. Colistin-resistant Gram-negative pathogens of ESKAPE group are serious threat to public health and should be subjected to infection control stewardship practices.",

Only sporadic cases have been reported so far, with Nocardia asteroides and Nocardia farcinica being the most common causative agents. Nocardia elegans is an opportunistic pathogen, accounting for only 0.3-0.6% of infections caused by Nocardia species, usually affecting the respiratory tract.In this study, a previously healthy 74-year-old man was admitted to the University Hospital of Heraklion with fever and intense pain radiating from the lumbar region to the groin and the left thigh, increasing with movement. Imaging findings revealed a large abscess in the left iliopsoas. Blood and pus aspirate cultures yielded a pure culture of Nocardia that was identified by 16S rRNA sequence as N. elegans. The patient was successfully treated with drainage of the abscess along with administration of ceftriaxone, linezolid and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. To our knowledge, this is the first report of iliopsoas abscess caused by N. elegans. Early, accurate diagnosis and timely treatment with drainage of the abscess and long-term administration of antimicrobial agents optimize the outcome.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 virus was initially identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and a global pandemic was declared in March 2020 by World Health Organization. COVID-19 disease is characterized with severe pneumonia and hypoxemia, especially in the elderly population. The elderly population was primarily vaccinated with CoronaVac, which is a whole virion inactivated vaccine (Sinovac Biotech, China) in Turkey. This study aimed to investigate the association of viral load and laboratory parameters with the severity of the disease and vaccination status in elderly (older than 60 years old) COVID-19 patients. The age range of the patients was 61-97 years old with a mean of 71.80. Vaccinated patients had a lower viral load (P = 0.253) in nasopharyngeal swabs during breakthrough COVID-19 infection compared to unvaccinated ones and were hospitalized for a shorter period of time in hospital wards (P = 0.035). A lower number of patients were vaccinated in both moderate (n = 33, 29.20%) and severe/critical group (n = 46, 34.07%) (P = 0.412). Only 17 (32.08%) vaccinated patients were hospitalized in an intensive care unit (ICU), whereas 36 (67.92%) of the ICU patients were unvaccinated (P = 0.931). Severe/critical patients had higher c-reactive protein (CRP), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), fibrinogen, ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels compared to the moderate group on the admission day (P < 0.05). Our study suggested that elderly patients vaccinated with CoronaVac had a shorter stay in hospitals and according to our results CRP, PLR, fibrinogen, ferritin, and LDH levels could be used to determine the severity of the infections.",

In a four-year retrospective analysis, the incidence, outcome, and the efficacy of PAP were evaluated in patients treated at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and Otorhinolaryngology at Kecskemét Hospital. The results were compared with data from the literature to determine if the use of PAP was adequate at the Department.During the study period (between 01/09/2007 and 31/01/2011) 108 patients were evaluated. The mean duration of prophylactic antibiotic treatment was 8.3 ± 5.2 days, with cefotaxime+metronidazole being the most commonly used combination. Surgical site infection occurred in 8 patients (7.5%) in the clean-contaminated category.Our results showed that the perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis administered at our Department was efficient and effective against the oral bacterial flora of patients. Its use is recommended in head and neck microsurgery. To avoid development of antibiotic resistance and to reduce costs, it seems that the duration of antibiotic regimen for primary surgery can be reduced from 8.3 ± 5.2 days to 3 days.",

The cdtABC genes in E. coli are either part of the genome of prophages, plasmid or pathogenicity island. In order to investigate the stability and the transfer potential of cdt-IV genes cdtB gene was replaced by chloramphenicol (Cm) resistance encoding cat gene in the avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC) strain E250. After consecutive passages in non-selective medium at 37 °C 7.6% (219/2900) of the investigated colonies of E250::cat strain became Cm-sensitive (Cm S ). To reveal deletion mechanism 177 Cm S colonies were investigated for presence of cdtA, cdtC and cdtC associated gene by PCR. One hundred and sixteen colonies of the Cm S colonies (65.5%) showed partial or complete deletion in the cdt-IV region. Progressive loss of the upstream genes of the cdt cluster in E250 compared to other CDT-IV producing APEC strains and the fact that all the potential deletion patterns were identified, suggests the presence of an unstable hitherto unknown genomic region. The failure of in vitro transfer of cdt genes into a porcine EPEC E. coli strain suggests that the deletion of cdt-IV flanking genes alone do not promote the spread of cdt-IV .",

Laboratory-based before-after study was conducted during a two-year period (January 2012 to December 2013) in Clinical Centre of Serbia. Isolation and identification of bacterial strains were done following standard microbiological procedures. During the AMR surveillance, nearly twice more bloodstream samples were collected compared to the year without surveillance (1,528 vs. 855). In total, 43 isolates of MRSA were identified. MRSA was significantly more prevalent during the AMR surveillance compared to the previous year [14 (66.7%) to 29 (76.3%); P = 0.046]. During the AMR surveillance, MRSA more frequently originated from medical departments compared to intensive care unit, surgical department, and internal medicine (P = 0.027) indicating increasing MRSA infections in patients with less severe clinical condition and no apparent risk factors. Higher prevalence of MRSA and its lower susceptibility to erythromycin were revealed by implementation of active AMR surveillance, which may reflect more thoughtful collection of bloodstream samples from patients with suspected BSI.",

NPS were tested with Liaison SARS-CoV-2 Ag test (DiaSorin, Italy) and DS Coronex COVID-19 Multiplex RT-PCR Diagnosis Kit (DS BioTechnology, Ankara, Turkey).Of 373 samples, 124 (33.2%) were found to be RT-PCR positive and 249 (66.8%) RT-PCR negative. Taking RT-PCR as a reference, the sensitivity and specificity of the Liaison SARS-CoV-2 Ag assay were found as 84.6% (95%CI 77.3%-90%) and 100% (95%CI 98.5%-100%), respectively. For samples with a cycle threshold (Ct) value <25 (high viral load), the sensitivity increased to 100%. When antigen concentration and Ct values were compared, a strong negative correlation between antigen and Ct values was determined (P < 0.001).The Liaison antigen test met the performance criteria recommended by the WHO for samples with the Omicron variant. In addition, it showed excellent sensitivity and specificity in patients with high viral load. Therefore, Liaison antigen test can be a reliable and useful alternative in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in resource-constrained laboratories.",

The study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review boards at hospitals. Samples were taken after hand washing. Bacteria on LWs wedding rings were detected with the rolling method, and further analyzed in order to determine the number of colony forming unit (CFU) per ring, species of bacteria and their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern, methicillin resistance and biofilm-producing capacity in vitro.Staphylococci were recovered from 60.8% of wedding rings. All strains produced biofilm (25% weak, 56.2% moderate and 18.8% large amount), with significant difference between species (P < 0.001). Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis formed the largest amount of biofilm and had the largest number of CFU per ring. Staphylococci were most commonly resistant to penicillin (66.7%), tetracycline (50.0%), and erythromycin (45.8%); 41.7% of isolates was multidrug resistant and mecA gene was detected in five strains. All strains were susceptible to linezolid, vancomycin, teicoplanin and tigecycline.Staphylococci colonize LWs wedding rings, form biofilm on it, have multidrug resistant phenotype and/or carry mecA gene, representing a significant reservoir for the spreading of microorganisms and resistance.

    "abstract": "Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a primarily sexually transmitted human pathogen linked with the formation of anogenital warts and several types of cancer including cervical cancer, oropharyngeal cancer, penile cancer, and anal cancer. HPV genotypes are divided into high-risk and low-risk in accordance with their potential for carcinogenesis. The most notable high-risk genotypes are HPV-16 and HPV-18. In this study we report on the PCR analysis results of the cervical smear results of 328 females, and 50 males who have presented to a tertiary care university hospital in the port city of İzmir, Türkiye between August 2019 and August 2022. HPV-DNA positivity percentage was determined as 25.3% (96/378). 5 of 378 patients were HPV-18 positive (age range 31-80) whereas 27 patients were HPV-16 positive (age range 29-66). 64 patients were positive for other high-risk HPV types (age range 27-56). The positivity for HPV-16, HPV-18 and other high-risk HPV types were determined as 7.14%, 1.3% and 16.9% respectively. Our results demonstrate a 25.3% (96/378) positivity among tested patients moreover, out of 96 positive cases at least 32 are vaccine preventable. This study indicates the need for higher coverage of HPV vaccination in Western Türkiye.",

More than 400,000 Syrian refugees live in Gaziantep. The aim of this study was to evaluate distribution of HCV genotypes among Syrian patients and in people who inject drugs. Serum samples form 1,628 individuals (786 female, 842 male) which were sent to our laboratory for genotyping between January 2013 and December 2022, were analyzed retrospectively. Three different HCV genotyping assays (Qiagen, RTA and Abbott) were used during the 10-year study period. Out of the 1,628 patients, genotype 1 was detected in 51.5%, genotype 3 in 21.4%, genotype 4 in 20%, genotype 5 in 4.6%, genotype 2 in 1.3%. Mixed genotype was found in 20 patients. Of the patients, 1,143 were Turkish patients and among those patients genotype 1 (66.8%) was the most common genotype followed by genotype 3 (29%). Among Syrian patients ( n = 477), genotype 4 (64.2%) was predominant genotype followed by genotype 1 and genotype 5. Genotype 3 was detected in 277 (79.6%) prisoners. All of them were male and probably the main source of HCV infection was intravenous drug abuse. While genotypes 1 and 4 were common in females, genotypes 1 and 3 were common in males. In the future genotype 3 may become an increasing problem due to the persons who inject drugs. Less frequent genotypes such as 4 and 5 may become more frequent due to Syrian patients.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant threat in veterinary medicine due to the excessive and inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents, compromising the effectiveness of these drugs. To combat AMR, the collection of data on the consumption of antibiotics is paramount, as there is a well-established connection between antibiotic use and AMR in both humans and food-producing animals. Hence, the current study aimed to generate measurable data concerning the sales patterns of antimicrobial drugs used in animal treatment in Montenegro over a five-year period (from 2017 to 2021). Furthermore, the study aimed to compare these sales figures with the overall sales of antimicrobial veterinary medicine products (AMVMPs) during the same period, with particular emphasis on the utilization of critically important antimicrobials (CIAs) for human use. Data on AMVMPs consumption from 2017 to 2021 were expressed in euros and were sourced from the Institute for Medicines and Medical Devices of Montenegro (CInMED) annual reports, complying with the regulatory framework of the Law on Medicines in this country. Research results indicate that the sales of AMVMPs increased from 2017 to peak in 2019, followed by a stable decline of 21.79% in 2021. However, the portion of selected CIAs AMVMPs in total sales experienced a minor decline from 2017 to 2019, followed by a noticeable 6.11% increase from 2019 to 2021. In order to address AMR challenges, these findings emphasize the importance of enhancing surveillance and monitoring of veterinary antimicrobial use, as well as CIAs for human use.",

The lesion surface areas induced by thaxtomin A were highest in treatment of the minitubers with extract of OMB inoculated with S-6 and S-7, intermediate with that inoculated with S-4 and lowest with S-3. The pathogenic isolates were identified by their colour of aerial mycelia, melanin pigment productivity (+ or -), the type of spore chains morphology and carbon utilization as either S. scabies strains S-3, S-4 and S-8, or S. acidiscabies strains S-6 and S-7. S-3 and S-4 produced 0.65 and 1.60 micrograms thaxtomin A per milliliter of OMB, respectively, whereas S-6 and S-7 produced similar amounts of thaxtomin A, 2.36 and 2.10 micrograms per ml of OMB, respectively. The optimal temperature for production of thaxtomin A by S. scabies and S. acidiscabies was 28 degrees C. Production of thaxtomin A by S. scabies strain S-4 and S. acidiscabies strain S-6 was suppressed at least 50-fold at 0.5 and 0.3% of glucose, respectively.

    "abstract": "Each of the more than 1500 polypeptide molecules of 7 different types building up the adenovirus capsid - probably even those of their amino-acids - are in symmetrical location. Every kind of polypeptide forms a separately also symmetrical network in the capsid distributed according to their functions in the inner and outer side and the inside of the facets and edges, but always in compliance with the icosahedral symmetry. Therefore, each different polypeptide also means a general symmetry motif in the capsid in its own symmetry network. Hexons can be considered as general symmetry motifs in some special association that is because of their environmental position four kinds of hexon types can be found, which are on every facet, next to one another, like three identical groups of four (GOF) according to the three-fold rotational symmetry. Two polypeptides of a peripentonal hexon of each GOF orient toward the penton and the third toward the other penton located further on the same edge. There are two versions of the arrangement of the GOFs: the hexons surround either a polypeptide IX or a polypeptide IIIa. The two versions of GOFs on 20 facets symmetrically recurring 60 times as general hexon symmetry motifs form the capsid in combination with the network of other polypeptides. Ideally, the surface of the hexon trimer shows three-fold rotational and three-fold reflexional symmetries. In the arrangement of hexons in the facets the translational, rotational, horizontal and vertical reflexional symmetry and the combination of these, as well as the glide reflexion and the antisymmetry can be found. Each hexon has six nearest neighbours and every hexon takes part in the construction of three hexon rows. Every facet and every vertex made up of five facets has an antisymmetrical pair located on the opposite side of the capsid. Every triangular facet participates in forming three vertices and every facet has three nearest neighbouring facets. In the facets, the polypeptide subunits of polypeptide IX centered GOF hexons have identical counter-clockwise orientation but the orientation of the neighbouring facets is always opposite compared to each other. On the five-fold symmetry axis, any facet can be “turned on” to the adjacent facet or “rotated” to all the others and will take the symmetry and orientation of the facet it got turned on or rotated to. Thus, every facet together with the polypeptides attached to it shows a twenty-fold symmetry and multiplicity. An other type of symmetry and multiplicity in the capsid is that perpendicular to the 6 five-fold rotation axes run a geodetic (equatorial) ribbon like motif (superfieces) altogether six made up of 10×10 triangular facets and bent ten-times with an angle of 36°. A triangular facet participates in forming three ribbon-like motifs, which intersect with each other on the given facet, but the same three motifs intersect repeatedly only on the antisymmetrically located facet.",

    "abstract": "The icosahedral adenovirus capsid has three rotational symmetry axes of different types. The six five-fold, ten three-fold and the fifteen two-fold axes have two superficial points each, altogether 62. The axes determine the number and location of the identical rotational facet groups and that during the different rotational phases which other regular facets and with what multiplicity shall be covered by them. The number of rotational facets of the five-, three- and two-fold rotational symmetry axes is 4, 6.66 and 10, respectively. In all the three cases, there are two kinds of possible arrangements of the facets. During the rotation--when the facets of the facet group placed on one by one to the neighbouring identical facet groups--at the five-fold axes, the facets of the rotational facet group get into cover position 12 times with all the 20 regular capsid facets, 20 times at the three-fold axes, and 30 times at the two-fold axes in a way that a different facet combination (facet hit) falls to every facet, and the original symmetry is not disturbed. After all, this means 240, 400 and 600 facet combinations, i.e. multiplicity in case of five-, three- and two-fold symmetry axes respectively, and these numbers correspond with that of the theoretically possible variations. The same results can be calculated by multiplying the number of real rotations of the capsid bringing the body into itself, i.e. the number 60 with the number of facets contributing to the five-, three- and two-fold rotational phases. The other way of the determination of multiplicity takes into account that all the facet groups of the capsid rotate simultaneously during all the rotational phases, and this multiplies the number of multiplicity with the number of the rotational types five-, three- and two-fold which result in one and the same multiplicity number in the case of five-, three- and two-fold symmetry, alike 1200. Perpendicular to the five-fold symmetry axes with the line of intersection drawn horizontally in the middle along the 6 geodetic ribbon like motifs a regular decagonal intersection forms and the capsid can be cut into two equal parts, in which the polypeptides show a 72 degree rotation from each other, but with a proper rotation the polypeptides get into a congruent position, which means 300 or 600 specific facet combinations. The capsid similar to the icosahedron has also 15 virtual mirror planes which divide the capsid into two, identically arranged halves, forming six right angle triangles on each facet, altogether 120 smaller rectangular so-called Mobius-triangles on the surface. In the three-fold symmetry axis of the facets, these triangles in two separate groups of three can be rotated symmetrically with 120 degrees according to the orientation of the polypeptide subunits in a way that the hexon and other polypeptides too nearly cover each other. Consequently, the adenovirus capsid is a symmetrically arranged body in which several various symmetry types and symmetry systems can be found and their structural symmetry elements exist simultaneously and covering each other. The icosahedral symmetry types and systems are valid and functional simultaneously and in parallel with great multiplicity, but the existence of more than 1500 structural elements in several depth levels, their order of location and distribution make the symmetry of the capsid richer and more complex.",

Of the phenotypic methods one, i.e. serotyping based on the heat stable antigen, is often hindered by the relatively large number of un-typable (NT) strains. Little is known, however, about the heterogeneity of the group formed by these NT strains. Therefore we serotyped 92 Hungarian, non-outbreak C. jejuni isolates and subjected the 28 NT strains to molecular analysis using PCR-RFLP of the flaAgene and to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. With both methods the NT strains were classified into several molecular types (17 and 25, respectively), while the number of subgroups based on the results of the two techniques combined was twenty- six. These results indicate that the NT group of strains is extremely heterogeneous in Hungary, and the epidemiological connection between two NT isolates cannot be established or excluded without the use of molecular typing techniques.",

TheSTs of the Belarusian strains were phylogenetically compared to the STs of 110 selected strains from 22 other European countries.Overall, eleven different genosubtypes were observed, there were seven variants of variable region of the fet Agene detected. The majority of the STs (95%) found in Belarus were novel and allthose were submitted to the Neisseria MLST database for assignment. Several newly discovered alleles of fumC (allele 451) and gdh (allele 560 and 621) appeared to be descendants of alleles which are widespread in Europe, and single aroE alleles (602 and 603) occurred as a result of separate evolution.N. meningitidis strains circulating in Belarus are heterogeneous and include sequence types, possibly, locally evolved in Belarus as well as representatives of widespread European hyperinvasive clonal complexes.",

    "abstract": "Chlamydophila pneumoniae is an obligate intracellular human pathogen, which causes acute respiratory tract infections and can also cause chronic infections. C. pneumoniae possess type III secretion system (TTSS), which allows them to secrete effector molecules into the inclusion membrane and the host cell cytosol. Low calcium response protein E (LcrE) is a part of TTSS. The gene of LcrE in a 6His-tagged form was cloned from C. pneumoniae CWL029, expressed and purified from Escherichia coli using the HIS-select TALON CellThru Resin, this gene was also cloned into a eukaryotic expression vector (pΔRC). One group of BALB/c mice received an intramuscular pΔRC inoculation then the mice were immunized with purified LcrE protein; the second group of mice was immunized two times with the recombinant plasmid (pΔRCLcrE), and the third group was primed with pΔRCLcrE inoculation then boosted with LcrE protein. LcrE-specific antibody response was induced by DNA immunization with a shift towards Th1 isotype pattern compared to protein-immunization, this shifting pattern was observed in plasmid primed then protein-boosted animals. DNA immunization given as a priming and followed by a protein booster significantly reduced the number of viable bacteria in the lungs after challenge with C. pneumoniae . These results confirm that immunization with pΔRCLcrE can be an effective part of a vaccination schedule against C. pneumoniae .",

The LPS produced a marked and dose-dependent inhibition of ConA-induced ascites and the effect of pre-treatment lasted up to almost a week. Complete inhibition could not be achieved. If administered alone, LPS did not produce ascites.It is well known that LPS enhances vascular permeability in several tissues, but the present work shows that peritoneal permeability is not enhanced by this agent.

The specific serum IgG level for aspergillus is a major diagnostic criterion in aspergillosis.Ninety-six asthmatic patients, with mean age of 5.4 ± 3.0 years who were referred to the asthma clinic of the Mofid Children's Hospital, were enrolled in this study. Serum specific IgG for aspergillus was measured and its association with severity of asthma was evaluated.Nineteen asthmatic patients (10 females and 9 males) had aspergillus IgG antibody. Among them, severe persistent asthma and moderate persistent asthma were detected in 5 and 13 cases, respectively, whereas only one patient suffered from mildpersistent asthma. A total of 36.5% of the 96 patients had a history of atopy, while 26% had allergic rhinitis. There was an association between the severity of asthma and the presence of aspergillus IgG antibody. Moreover, the positivity for aspergillus IgG antibody was higher in older patients.Our results indicated an association between aspergillus antibody level and severity of asthma. It could be recommended that the IgG titer for aspergillus is measured in pediatric patients with asthma, whereas co-morbidity of aspergillosis and asthma increases the risk of asthma exacerbation.",

Gas yield data clearly demonstrated the physiological adaptation to substrate shifts. Statistical analysis of DNA and chemotaxonomic biomarkers revealed community abundance changes. Sequences gained from DGGE bands showed the dominance of the phyla Bacteroidetes and the presence of Firmicutes (Clostridia) and Thermotogae. This was supported by the detection of large amounts of branched 15-carbon non-hydroxy fatty acids in PLFA profiles, as common PLFA markers of the Bacteroidetes group.

Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing revealed 21 strain types, comprising 7 clusters which contained at least two isolates and 14 unique PFGE patterns. Although we searched for pathogenicity factor genes (gelE, cylB, asa1, efaAfs, esp, cpd, cob) in representatives of all macro-restriction patterns, they have been confirmed in only one clone of E. faecalis. Genes esp and hyl, commonly found in E. faecium, were yilded in 10 macro-restriction patterns of this species, and their presence could not be ascribed to clonally related strains (p = 0.05). All VRE isolates were multiresistant and positive for vanA gene. Twenty strains of VRE and 6 clusters obtained from Intensive care unit (ICU) are proof of intensive transmission of these microorganisms at this department. The results of this study suggest wide genotypic variability among the clinical VRE isolates, but also intrahospital dissemination of some of them.",

The samples were examined using the conventional microbiological technique.Of 315 bacterial isolates the most common were streptococcal species, 105 (33%), of which 55 (17.3%) represented the Streptococcus milleri group. Gram-positive anaerobic cocci were detected in 56 (17.6%) isolates. Enterobacteriaceae family included 27 (8.5%) isolates and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was registered in 13 (4.1%). No statistically significant difference was registered in pathogen distribution in the examined period ( p = 0.288).The most common agents of community-acquired pleural infections are the Streptococcus milleri group and anaerobic Gram-positive cocci. They differ from the most common pathogens of pneumonia. Among the hospital-acquired pleural infections, Pseudomonas species, Staphylococcus aureus and enterobacteria prevail. The distribution of bacterial agents isolated in the 5-year period exhibits no significant differences.",

Heat-sensitization effect of pre-irradiation of spores was proven not only by colony counting but also with differential scanning calorimetry. Under a linearly programmed temperature increase, the heat destruction of spores surviving 2.5 kGy gamma irradiation resulted in at a few centigrade lower temperature than that of untreated spores. Heat denaturation endotherms in the DSC-thermogram of irradiated spores were shifted to lower temperatures as well. Comparative turbidimetric, luminometric and phase-contrast microscopic studies of untreated, heat-treated and irradiated spore populations showed that the kinetics of germination and the light emission during germination of radiation-inactivated spores were the same as those of untreated spores, revealing that the pre-formed luciferase enzyme packaged into the spores during sporulation remained intact after an irradiation dose causing 90% decrease in number of colony forming spores. Therefore, in contrast to heat-treated spores, the initial bioluminescence reading upon germination of irradiated spores does not reflect the viable count of their population.",

Treatment of ras-transformed cells with interferon-a with or without retinoic acid results in their persistent reversion to a non-transformed state that is dependent on the restoration of LO expression. When such revertant cells are treated with 5-azacytidine (5-azaC), they undergo rapid morphological retransformation. Within one passage after addition of 5-azaC, there was a down regulation of LO mRNA and proenzyme protein. These data suggest a direct relationship between the transformed state and LO expression.",

    "abstract": "Lymphomas are solid tumors consisting of lymphoid cells; they form a heterogeneous group of less or more malignant disorders. A portion of lymphomas develop due to latent herpesvirus infections established in B and/or T-lymphocytes. The basis for latency is a lifelong presence of the circularized covalently linked viral genome within nuclei of carrier lymphocytes. In certain cases, however, the essential event leading to tumor formation is the integration of a portion(s) of viral DNA into the host cell DNA. This leads to rearrangements within the host cell genome on one hand, and, on other hand, to unregulated expression of oncoproteins encoded by the integrated fragment. Our review deals with mechanisms of lymphoma formation regarding to the role of non-structural herpesvirus oncoproteins interfering with the regulation of cell division and/or exerting anti-apoptotic effects. In addition, the authors wish to highlight the common procedures, which allowed isolation and/or identification of lymphoma-associated viruses in cell cultures derived from tumors and/or proliferating lymphatic tissues.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial communities from the sulfide containing curative well waters of Harkány Spa (Hungary) were investigated by cultivation independent molecular cloning and Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) methods between 2006 and 2008. The DGGE profiles of the bacterial communities originated from the wells of lukewarm waters showed seasonal similarities and were highly different from the thermal well. From the four clone libraries 22 different eubacterial species or genera were identified by sequence analysis. The majority of the clones of the lukewarm waters belonged to unidentified Epsilon-proteobacteria, Desulfocapsa sp. and Thiothrix spp., while the dominant clones of the thermal water were affiliated with the genus Denitratisoma sp. Most of the identified species and genera were related to bacteria with obligate or facultative chemolithotrophic sulfur metabolism, so the microbes of the curative waters may participate in the sulfur-cycle of the wells.",

    "abstract": "Bactericidal effect against non-dividing bacteria is a very advantageous, but rare characteristic among antimicrobial agents, mostly possessed by those affecting the cell membrane. These kinds of agents can kill bacterial cells without lysis. We assessed these characteristics on primycin, a topical anti-staphylococcal agent highly effective against prevalent multiresistant strains, as it also acts on the cell membrane. In time-kill studies, primycin preserved its bactericidal activity against growth-arrested Staphylococcus aureus cultures. The bactericidal action was slower against growth-arrested cultures compared to the exponentially growing ones to different extents depending on the manner of arrest. The bactericidal effect was less influenced by stringent response and by protein synthesis inhibition, proving that it does not depend on metabolic activity. In contrast, uncoupling of the membrane potential predominantly slowed, and low temperature almost stopped killing of bacteria. In consideration of published data, these facts suggest that the antibacterial action of primycin involves disrupting of the membrane potential, and is predominantly influenced by the membrane fluidity. Optical density measurements and transmission electron microscopy verified that primycin kills bacterial cells without lysis. These results reveal favorable characteristics of primycin and point to, and broaden the knowledge on its membrane-targeted effect.",

    "abstract": "Comparative genomic studies enable us to better understand how genomes function and evolve.Although the sequencing processes become more and more accurate and fast, assembling of draft genomic sequences remains a serious challenge in many cases.However, this task is worth the effort, because it allows us to perform extensive and thorough comparative evolutionary studies, as more complete understanding can be obtained by comparing entire genomes.The fission yeasts (Schizosaccharomyces) provide an interesting model for genome evolution as they belong to one of the basal groups of Ascomycota (Taphrinomycotina) and have a distinct life history from other yeasts.If we compare them to the genus Saccharomyces, they are as different from each other as they are from animals.Schizosaccharomyces cryophilus is a relatively new, recently described fission yeast species so named for its preference for growth at lower temperatures compared with its other relatives.Although S. cryophilus is morphologically similar to S. octosporus, analysis of several rapidly evolving sequences revealed significant divergence from any previously characterized Schizosaccharomyces strains.The genome of the fission yeast species have been sequenced and assembled recently, except the S. cryophilus genome, as the scaffolds of its sequence was not assembled into complete chromosomes.It has been also reported that fission yeasts could have unusually stable genome structures because conservation of the gene content in their genomes is significantly high.Here we suggest a hypothetic genome assembly of S. cryophilus depending on synteny relationships and common genomic features.We created pairwise whole genome alignments with the Mauve aligner using either the sequence of S. pombe or S. octosporus as reference genomes.Furthermore, we identified the subtelomeric and centromeric contig ends of S. cryophilus and we used them as anchor points for the assembly.Thereafter we validated our hypothesis with PCR using sequence specific primers annealed to contig ends and karyotypic analysis combined with Southernhybridization.Finally, we introduced some new genome characteristics of S. cryophilus by comparing the assembled genome to the other related genomes.Our analysis clearly pointed out that S. cryophilus is more similar to S. octosporus than to S. pombe not only in sequence identity but also in gene order.We observed that the genome of S. cryophilus underwent approximately equal number of rearrangement events as S. octosporus compared with S. pombe.The alignments suggested that the main chromosomal rearrangements occurred between the species were interchromosomal translocations.Surprisingly, examples of large-scale inversions between the genomes of S. cryophilus and S. octosporus seemed to be very rare.Considering the extent/scale of the sequence divergence and the number of rearrangements found in the fission yeasts, we supposed that their structural and sequence evolution are correlated at least in the case of the above three species.",

    "abstract": "Poliomyelitis was a disease feared worldwide, striking suddenly and paralysing mainly children for life. Monitoring of suspected cases of poliomyelitis is carried out with Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) surveillance in Turkey. This study examines national data of AFP surveillance and the epidemiology of enteroviruses (EV) in Turkey from 2000 to 2019 and gives an overview of the detected serotypes of EVs. A total of 13,640 samples collected from patients with 5216 AFP pre-diagnosed cases (2 samples from each patient) and 3,208 contacts, during a 20-year period (2000-2019) were investigated. All isolated polioviruses were tested for their wild or vaccine origin according to the WHO recommended protocol by PCR and sequencing analysis were performed. Enterovirus positivity was detected in a total of 915 cases, which were identified as 204 Sabin-like polio virus (SLPV) and 711 non-polio enterovirus (NPEV). Of the 204 SLPV, 141 (69.1%) AFP were detected in patients and 63 (30.9%) were detected in samples taken from their contacts. Of the 711 NPEVs, 516 (72.5%) were from AFP cases and 195 (27.5%) were detected in samples taken from their contacts. It is concluded that the reason for the higher detection rate of NPEV in samples from AFP pre-diagnosed cases is attributed to the polio vaccination rates reaching 97% between 2008 and 2019 in Turkey. The most frequently detected NPEV serotypes were Coxackie A24, B3, and Echo 30. This retrospective study is the first comprehensive study in Turkey to evaluate the results of the AFP surveillance in the last 20 years.",

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been used as a safe and highly effective treatment option for rCDI refractory to standard antibiotic therapies. The aim of this study was to report the efficacy of FMT in Iranian rCDI patients with concurrent IBD. A total of seven consecutive patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) who had experienced 3 episodes of rCDI were enrolled in this study. All patients received at least a single FMT administered during colonoscopy by direct infusion of minimally processed donor stool. Patients were followed for a minimum of 6 months for assessment of treatment efficacy and adverse events (AEs) attributable to FMT. All 7 UC patients (100%) experienced a durable clinical response to a single FMT following 2 months after the procedure. One patient received a second FMT in which a successful resolution of rCDI was ultimately achieved. No serious AEs from FMT were noted. FMT through colonoscopy was a safe, simple and effective alternative treatment approach for rCDI in patients with underlying IBD. However, its use and efficacy should be pursued in long-term prospective controlled trials.",

Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) is considered the drug of choice for treatment of S. maltophilia infections, thus emerging resistance to TMP/SMX poses a serious threat. In the present study we aimed to investigate the frequency of TMP/SMX resistance genes (sul1, sul2, dfrA), and to evaluate their relatedness with integron 1 (int1), and insertion sequence common regions (ISCR) among 100 S. maltophilia from different clinical isolates in Egypt. Isolates were identified biochemically and confirmed by VITEK2. Detection of sul1, sul2, and dfrA genes, int1 and ISCR elements was performed by PCR. Among the 16 TMP/SMX resistant isolates, sul1 gene was detected in all of them, and it was associated with int1 gene presence in all resistant isolates. The sul2 gene was detected in 6 out of 16 resistant isolates (37.5%), and only 2 of the 16 resistant isolates (12.5%) harboured dfrA gene. ISCR was detected in 10 of the resistant isolates (62.5%) and in 4 of them it was associated with the presence of sul2 gene. Among the 84 TMP/SMX sensitive isolates, sul1 gene was detected in 15 (17.8%), int1 in 16 (19%) and ISCR in 6 (7.1%). None of the susceptible isolates had sul2 or dfrA genes. These findings point out an increasing frequency of TMP/SMX resistance genes among S. maltophilia clinical isolates in our region, so the adoption of prudent use of S. maltophilia antimicrobial agents and the establishment of a surveillance system are desperately needed.",

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the causative agent of CC however, HPV genotype distribution varies across regions. This study examined the distribution and impact of vaccine-related high-risk (HR)-HPVs on the development of cervical dysplasia in Montenegrin women. A total of 187 women who had a clinical indication for cervical biopsy were enrolled. Based on histopathological findings, women were classified into 2 groups, with and without dysplasia. HR-HPV was detected by real-time PCR. Twelve HR-HPV genotypes were detected in 40.6% of cervical samples. The 7 most prevalent HR-HPVs in order of decreasing frequency were HPV 16 (39.5%), 45 (23.7%), 31 (21.0%), 33 (17.1%), 18 (6.6%), 52 (6.6%), and 58 (6.6%), all of them are targeted by nonavalent vaccine. Vaccine-related HR-HPVs had a higher prevalence (92.1%) than the other HR-HPVs detected in HR-HPV–positive samples. Among HR-HPV–positive women, HPV 16 and 33 were more common in women with dysplasia than in those without dysplasia (HPV 16: 28.9 vs 7.2%; HPV 33: 11.8 vs 3.6%). HPV 16 was the most common HR-HPV genotype in cervical samples, followed by HPV 45, 31, 33, 18, 52, and 58. HPV 16 and 33 were shown to be associated with the development of cervical dysplasia. These results indicate that prophylactic nonavalent vaccine can potentially prevent approximately 90% of HR-HPV infections and 60% of cervical dysplasia cases in Montenegrin women.",

Box 56, H-4010 Debrecen, Hungary It is well established, that some yeast strains have antagonistic activities. They are usually able to inhibit the growth of filamentous fungi. This activity can be used as a biological control against post-harvest rotting caused by filamentous fungi. Yeast-based biological protection can be a healthier way to protect food during storage, than using antifungal chemical agents. To isolate novel antagonistic yeasts, we have isolated colored yeast strains from noble-rotted grapes and tested them for antifungal activity on agar plates, in liquid media and also on fruits. The tests identified several Metschnikowia strains with such antagonistic activity. We also investigated apple surface microbiota, because apple is one of the fruits which are often affected by post-harvest rotting. From apple surface we have isolated 700 yeasts and 40 filamentous fungi. When we tested the yeast isolates for antagonistic ability, we also found Metschnikowia strains which were able to inhibit the growth of filamentous fungi. These findings suggest that antagonistic strains are quite common among Metschnikowia yeasts colonizing fruits. Sequencing of the chromosomal region of the antagonistic isolates coding for the D1/D2 domain of the 26S ribosomal RNA revealed close taxonomic relationship with the type strains of M. fructicola and M. pulcherrima. 1217-8950/$20.00 © 2008 Akademiai Kiado, Budapest Acta Microbiologica et Immunologica Hungarica, 55 (3), p. 363 (2008) DOI: 10.1556/AMicr.55.2008.3.7 * Abstract of the Fourth Hungarian Conference of Mycology, May 29–31, 2008, Debrecen, Hungary",

    "abstract": "In Hungary among others there were some special factors, which shaped the outcome of HIV/AIDS epidemic. (1) In the early period of pandemic the \"iron curtain\" delayed and limited the importation of HIV to Hungary. (2) In 1985, at the time of detection of first HIV infected persons the etiological diagnostic tools were already commercially available and laboratory facilities have been created immediately for HIV antibody tests in networks of blood banks, public health and venereological services. (3) Laboratory facilities together with introduced health regulations resulted in (a) elimination of possibility of nosocomial HIV transmission by blood, blood products and organ transplantation; (b) efficient case finding and contact tracing in population groups potentially playing a significant role in spreading of infection; (c) opportunities for voluntary HIV testing free of charge. (4) Broad scale education and information activities have been developed from the beginning by governmental and non-governmental organizations alike. (5) Parenteral drug abuse did not play a role in spreading of HIV, so far. The above factors resulted in a slowly developing moderate epidemic. The facts are as follows. By the end of 2000 altogether 879 HIV positive (666 male, 100 female and 113 anonymous) persons have been notified, 377 (344 male and 33 female) of whom showed already the characteristic features of AIDS and 229 died. 29% of registered HIV positive persons have been foreigners originating from 56 countries. The cumulative incidence rate of AIDS was 38 per million population. 73% of Hungarian HIV positive persons and 72% of patients with AIDS belonged to transmission group of men having sex with men. The age of HIV positive persons at the time of detection was between 20 and 49 years in 81% and 72% of them resided in or around Budapest.",

    "abstract": "The first 60-min phase of inflammatory ascites formation was studied by intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered macromolecular inducers: yeast cell wall zymosan binds to specific macrophage receptors, polyethyleneimine (PEI) and concanavalin A (ConA), produces non-covalent cross-links on the surface of various cells, while λ-carrageenan may function as a contact activator. Depletion of peritoneal macrophages was performed by overnight pretreatment with diphtheria toxin in transgenic mice, resulting in a significant (p < 0.01) decrease in the induced formation of ascitic fluid. It was shown that induced ascites is mediated partly (PEI, ConA, and carrageenan) or completely (zymosan) by peritoneal macrophages. Inhibition of prostanoid synthesis with indomethacine or of the kallikrein/bradykinin system with aprotinin also produced a significant (p < 0.01) but incomplete inhibition. A slight additivity occurred between the different inhibitory effects. In another series of experiments, the i.p. administration of bradykinin (without a macromolecular inducer) also produced marked ascites, which was not affected by macrophage depletion. The origin of the macrophage-independent part of the induced ascites is best explained by the deformation of the mesothelial cell surface, resulting in signal transfer to the underlying endothelium and the passage of ascitic fluid in the opposite direction. The soluble mediators are represented by prostanoids, bradykinin and other, unidentified agonists.",

This work aimed to characterize the skin and oropharyngeal microbiota, as well as their antimicrobial resistance profiles, of East-Timor populations to identify potentially pathogenic Gram-positive cocci. In order to assess the prevalence of pathogenic bacteria in East-Timor, the oropharyngeal and skin microbiota of 74 individuals was characterized. Gram-positive cocci were evaluated and their antimicrobial resistance profiles were determined. A total of 228 oropharyngeal and 278 skin samples were obtained. The population consisted of 36.5% of asymptomatic carriers of Gram-positive cocci. Kocuria rosea (n = 7, 19.4%), Staphylococcus spp. (n = 6, 16.7%), and Micrococcus luteus (n = 6, 16.7%) were isolated, among others. Antimicrobial resistance levels ranged between 0% and 36.1%, and a multiresistance profile was observed in one third of the isolates. Gram-positive cocci colonization was associated with age group. Prevalence of multiresistant isolates was higher in males who were sampled at the refugee camp. Results show that the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance on East Timor may be underestimated. This study represents the first step toward the full characterization of potential pathogenic Gram-positive cocci present in the populations from East Timor.",

We describe the first laboratory diagnosed imported Zika-infections of Hungary, to highlight the challenges of microbiological identification of the pathogen, caused by serological cross-reactivity and short viremia. Serological examination was carried out using indirect immunofluorescent assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Plaque-reduction neutralization test was used for verification purposes. A wide range of clinical specimens: serum, whole-blood, urine, saliva, and semen were analyzed by molecular methods, and sequencing was applied in case of PCR positive results to identify the virus strain. Zika-infected patients with previous vaccination against flaviviruses or possible flavivirus infection in the past showed high serological cross-reactivity, and even cross-neutralizing antibodies were observed. Zika virus RNA could be detected in urine specimen in case of two patients, and in EDTA-anticoagulated whole-blood sample of one patient. The detected strains belong to the Asian lineage of the virus. We presume that serological investigation of imported Zika virus could be altered by infections, vaccination of endemic flaviviruses in Hungary and vice versa.",

In 2013, Serbia participated in the European Clostridium difficile Infection Surveillance Network (ECDIS-Net) who launched a pilot study to enhance laboratory capacity and standardize surveillance for CDI. Two clinics of Clinical Center of Serbia [Clinic for Infectious and Tropical Diseases (CITD) and Clinic of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology (COT)] from Belgrade and one general hospital from another metropolitan area of Serbia, Užice, participated. During a period of 3 months in 2013, all patients with diagnosed CDI were included. The CDI incidence rates in CITD, COT, and General Hospital Užice were 19.0, 12.2, and 3.9 per 10,000 patient-days, respectively. In total, 49 patients were enrolled in the study with average age of 72 years. A complicated course of CDI was found in 14.3% of all patients. Six (12.2%) of 49 patients died, but not attributable to CDI. Of 39 C. difficile isolates, available for ribotyping, 78.9% belonged to ribotype 027; other PCR ribotypes were 001, 015, 002, 005, 010, 014, and 276. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed low levels of MIC 50 and MIC 90 for metronidazole (0.5 μg/ml both) and vancomycin (0.25 and 0.5 μg/ml), while 28 strains of ribotype 027 were resistant to moxifloxacin with MIC ≥4 μg/ml. National surveillance is important to obtain more insight in the epidemiology of CDI and to compare the results with other European countries. This study by ECDIS-Net gives bases for a national surveillance of CDI in Serbia.",

Patients who underwent revision hip, knee, or shoulder arthroplasty caused by PJI (n = 20) or AL (n = 10) were enrolled in the study. 16S rRNA sequencing targeting the V3-V4 region was performed on the microbial specimens collected from synovial fluid, periprosthetic deep-tissue, and biofilm during the revision surgery. The sequenced raw data were analysed for microbial composition and ecological and differential abundance analyses using bioinformatics tools. The AL group had relatively balanced and higher diversity, with Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Veillonella being prominent. In the PJI group, Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas were predominant, especially in deep-tissue samples and biofilm samples, respectively. The differential abundance analysis identified 15 and 2 distinctive taxa in the AL and PJI groups, respectively. Our findings provided preliminary insights supporting the existence of periprosthetic microbiota in orthopedic implants and explaining the differences in microbial composition between the AL and PJI groups.",

Alterations in the lipid A or/and the two-component pmrAB were earlier detected in colistin resistance. We investigated and analyzed two strains of A. baumannii (ABRC1 and ABRC2) isolated from two patients admitted to intensive care unit with a septic shock. Both strains were resistant to all tested antibiotics including colistin with a MIC >256 mg L-1. Colistin resistance genes (pmrA, pmrB, lpxA, lpxC, lpxD, and lpsB) of two strains (ABRC1 and ABRC2) were investigated by PCR and sequencing. Obtained nucleic acid sequences were aligned with reference sequences of ATCC 19606 and 17987. In this study two amino acid mutations, N287D in the lpxC gene and E117K in the lpxD gene, were detected in both ABRC1 and ABRC2 strains. ABRC1 had an additional H200L mutation in the pmrA gene. Both colistin resistant strains harbored the same A138T mutation in the pmrB gene. The ABRC2 strain also had an alteration in the kinase domain, specifically an R263S substitution of the histidine kinase domain. Three identical mutations were found in the lpsB gene of both A. baumannii strains: Q216K + H218G + S219E. As a result, a newly deduced protein sequence in both ABRC1 and ABRC2 strains differed from those described in ATCC 17978 and 19606 strains was determined. Colistin resistance is multifactorial in A. baumannii. In our study we detected novel mutations in colistin resistant A. baumannii clinical isolates.",

Previous studies have shown that K. pneumoniae can enter or cross cells through the intestinal epithelium, but the mechanism is unknown. In this study, we treated the intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2 with KP1195, a clinically isolated strain with high adhesion and invasion of intestinal epithelial cells. The results showed that the treatment of K. pneumoniae could increase the expression of integrin gene and further disrupt the changes of cytoskeleton. Treating Caco-2 with cytoskeletal inhibitor cytorelaxin D can significantly increase the efficiency of K. pneumoniae invading Caco-2 cells. These data suggest that disruption of the cytoskeleton through integrins may be one of the mechanisms by which K. pneumoniae increases intracellular invasion. This study provides a theoretical basis for further understanding of the mechanism of K. pneumoniae entering intestinal epithelial cells.",

Whole genome sequencing was subsequently performed, that identified Acidaminococcus sp. AM33-14BH and demonstrated the following resistance genes: cfxa, tet(X) and tet(Q). An antibiogram for anaerobes was performed showing that the strain was resistant to amoxicillin but sensitive to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, piperacillin-tazobactam, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem and rifampin.

Among these reservoirs, pets are carrying antibiotic-resistant strains. The objective of this study was to assess the resistance profiles of Escherichia coli, and the prevalence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producing E. coli strains in dogs and cats from Tamaulipas, Mexico. A total of 300 stool samples (150 dogs and 150 cats) from healthy pets were subjected to analysis. Antibiotic susceptibility testing and the identification of ESBLs were carried out by disc diffusion method. The presence of resistance genes, class 1, 2, and 3 integrons (intI1, intI2, and intI3) and phylogroups was determined by PCR analysis. The findings reveal that 42.6% (128/300) of the strains exhibited resistance to at least one of the eight antibiotics assessed, and 18.6% (56/300) demonstrated multidrug resistance (MDR), that distributed across 69 distinct resistance patterns. Altogether 2.6% of E. coli strains (8/300) were confirmed as TEM and CTX-M type ESBL producers.

The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and epidemiology of CDI after the COVID-19 pandemic in hospitalized patients in a rehabilitation center in Thessaloniki, Greece. Α retrospective observational cohort study was performed in inpatients diagnosed with diarrhea of all ages (January 2023 - December 2023) who were initially screened for CDI. From the total cohort of patients with proven CDI, some patients were randomly selected based on their monthly isolation incidence throughout the study period, to investigate their epidemiological data and clinical characteristics. Laboratory diagnosis of CDI was performed by enzyme immunoassay, followed by specific anaerobic culture and molecular testing for detection of toxigenic C. difficile. The isolated C. difficile strains were further characterized by PCR ribotyping. The annual incidence of CDI during the study period was 27.1% (130/480). The linear trend of CDI incidence decreased from 32.5% to 18.2% ( P = 0.024). The all-cause mortality rate was 5.0% (3/60). A positive correlation was observed between the length of hospital stay and the number of recurrences ( r = 0.546, P &lt; 0.001), while 28 patients (46.7%) experienced recurrence of the infection. Seven different PCR ribotypes were identified in this study. C. difficile tcdA +, tcdB +, cdtA +, cdtB + PCR ribotype 181 (RT181) was the predominant (76.6%, 46/60), followed by toxin A-negative PCR RT017 (11.6%, 7/60).

T2 magnetic resonance (T2MR®) (T2 Biosystems®, Lexington, MA, USA) is an innovative technology that can rapidly identify pathogens from a sample of whole blood in a remarkably short time frame of 3–5 h. We are evaluating if the T2Bacteria Panel (T2BP) contributes to the etiological diagnosis of bloodstream infections when combined with standard blood cultures (BC). The study was performed between December 2018 and March 2019, and a total of 28 patients with suspected BSI were included. The most notable finding of our study was that the addition of T2BP to BC in a diagnostic workflow led to a statistically significant higher rate of T2BP-targeted bacteria identification in patients with suspected BSI (46.4% versus 7.1%, P = 0.001) when compared to BC alone. Considering the measures of diagnostic accuracy, T2BP showed 100.00% sensitivity, 88.24% specificity, 100% negative predictive value (NPV), and 84.62% positive predictive value (PPV).

    "abstract": "Abstract Treatment options are limited for infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) isolates due to the production of metallo-β-lactamase (MBL). The ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA)/ aztreonam (ATM) combination represents a new therapeutic approach in MBL-positive isolates. Our study aims to determine distribution of carbapenemase genes in CRKP isolates and to investigate the in vitro synergistic effect of the CZA/ATM combination. Our study included 48 CRKP strains isolated from various clinical samples. Identification was performed using MALDI-TOF MS (bioMérieux, France), and susceptibility was tested with Vitek-2 (bioMérieux). The susceptibility to CZA and ATM was determined using CZA 30/20 µg and ATM 30 µg (Oxoid™,UK) disks. Carbapenemase genes VIM, NDM, IMP, KPC, OXA-23, OXA-58, OXA-48, and OXA-51 were investigated in only 44 isolates using the Bio-Speedy Carbapenem resistance qPCR (Bioexen, Turkiye) kit. Synergy testing was evaluated with double disk diffusion, gradient strip (bioMérieux)/disk diffusion, and broth disk elution methods. Out of 48 carbapenem-resistant isolates, 40 (83.3%) isolates showed resistance to CZA and 46 (95.8%) to aztreonam. Synergy was detected with all three methods in all isolates identified as resistant to CZA, CZA-sensitive isolates were not included in this evaluation. The most frequently detected carbapenemase genes were NDM+OXA-48, found in 28 (63.6%) of the isolates. Although the NDM+OXA-48 coexistence predominates in our center, in vitro synergy between CZA and ATM was detected in all of CZA-resistant isolates. Performing the CZA+ATM synergy test and reporting the result is crucial for choosing appropriate treatment in CRKP infection.",

Presence of MRSA was ascertained using culture and/or real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR).A total of 3,795 patients were included in the study. More than half of the patients were ≤19 years of age (2,094, 55.2%), and MRSA positivity was more common among these patients. Turkish patients constituted 24.5% of the study population. International patients were most frequently referred from Iraq (55.92%), Libya (11.44%), Romania (2.69%), and Bulgaria (1.98%). MRSA positivity was significantly more common among patients referred from other countries when compared to Turkish nationals (11.5% vs. 4.4%, P = 0.00001). Countries with the highest prevalence rates of MRSA colonization were as follows with decreasing order: United Arab Emirates, 25.0%; Georgia, 23.1%; Russia, 22.7%; Iraq, 13.0%, Romania, 12.7%. Other countries with high number of admitted patients (>70 patients) had the following MRSA rates: Turkey, 4.4%; Libya, 6.0%; Bulgaria, 5.3%.Although MRSA has a low prevalence in our center, a variation in the rate of MRSA positivity was observed across patients from different countries. Absence hospital acquired contamination or outbreaks in our institution may be attributed to the screening algorithm used and underscores the importance of risk analysis for patients referred from geographical locations with unknown MRSA frequency, to reduce the risk of transmission.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cancer is a multifactorial disease that is the second leading cause of death after cardiovascular disease in the world. In recent years, microbiota’s role in the regulation and homeostasis of the immune system has been considered. Moreover, the immune system can affect the microbiota content. These interactions are critical to the functioning of the immune system. Numerous studies in animal and human models have shown the association of changes in microbiota components with the formation of an inhibitory microenvironment in the tumor and its escape from the immune system. Microbiota also plays a crucial role in the success of various anti-tumor treatments, and its modification leads to success in cancer treatment. The success of anti-tumor therapies that directly target the immune system, such as immune checkpoint blockade and T cell therapy, is also affected by the patient’s microbiota composition. It seems that in addition to examining the patient’s genetics, precision medicine should pay attention to the patient’s microbiota in choosing the appropriate treatment method, and together with usual anti-tumor therapies, microbiota may be modified. This review discusses various aspects of the relationship between microbiota and anti-tumor immunity and its successful treatment.",

This study aimed to identify mutations in 4 genes related to rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol resistance among clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis from southwestern Iran. After drug susceptibility testing of 6620 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates by proportional method, a total of 24 FLD-resistant strains were included in the study. Fragments of rpoB , pncA , embB, and ubiA genes were amplified and sequenced to mine the mutations by pairwise alignment with the corresponding M. tuberculosis H37Rv genes. Phenotypic resistance to rifampin, isoniazid, and ethambutol was detected in 67, 54, and 33% ( n = 16, 13, and 8) of the isolates, respectively. Of rifampin-resistant isolates, 31% (5/16) were mono-resistant, and 56% (9/16) were multidrug-resistant (MDR). In 100% of rifampin-resistant isolates, mutations were found in the rifampin resistance-determining region (RRDR) of the rpoB , with S450L substitution being the most common, especially in MDRs (77.8%, 7/9). Resistance-conferring mutations in pncA were present in 12.5% (3/24) of FLD-resistant isolates. The embB and ubiA mutations were found in 62.5 and 12.5% (5/8 and 1/8) of ethambutol-resistant isolates, respectively, of which the embB D354A was the most common substitution (37.5%, 3/8). Sixteen distinct mutations were identified, one of which was novel. The sequence analysis of the RRDR segment was the best way to detect rifampin resistance. The rpoB S450L substitution could be a helpful molecular marker to predict MDR. In other genes, no mutation was identified as a reliable marker.",

One virus from a patient with hand, foot, and mouth disease had two amino acid changes in the VP1 capsid protein. An amino acid difference was also detected in the non-structural 2C gene of one virus sequenced from a throat swab sample from a patient with meningitis, compared to the faecal specimen taken two days later. Two amino acid changes, one in the capsid protein, were found between faecal samples of meningitis patients of different ages.Sequencing the whole capsid genome revealed several nucleotide and amino acid differences between E9 virus strains detected in Hungary in 2018.",

Altogether 48 S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium isolates were collected from patients at certain Iranian hospitals between May 2018 and September 2021. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by disk diffusion and broth microdilution methods. The presence of antibiotic-resistance genes (blaTEM,blaSHV,blaCTX-M,blaNDM,strA, strB, aadA1, tetA, tetB, floR, sul1, sul2, dfrA), integrons (classe 1 and 2), and virulence-associated genes (invA, stn, sopB, spvC, rck, phoPQ) was investigated by PCR and sequencing. Antimicrobial agents like trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and imipenem represent highly efficient agents with 97% susceptibility. S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium exhibited high resistance to ciprofloxacin (n = 20, 71.43%) and ceftazidime (n = 9, 45%), respectively. Overall, 3 (6.25%), 13 (27.08%), and 6 (12.5%) isolates were divided into strong, moderate, and weak biofilm producers, respectively.

The most common emm genotypes were emm28 (22%), emm1 (18.6%), emm12 (13.9%), and emm3 (11.6%). Also, the most common virulence genes were speG (58.1%), speC (56.9%), sdaB (53.4%), and mac (53.4%). The rates of resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and telithromycin were 19.8%, 16.3%, 4.7%, 3.5%, and 3.5%, respectively.As a result, additional regional studies on the detection and prevalence of GAS virulence factors in Turkey are required. We believe that this study will provide valuable information for epidemiological studies on emm sequences, Sags, and other virulence factors of Streptococcus pyogenes in Turkey.",

    "abstract": "The aim of our study was to delineate an outbreak of gastroenteritis caused by Shigella flexneri and affecting sixteen persons between May and June 2014 in Bilbao, Spain. All patients exhibited symptoms after consuming kebab in the same kebab shop.The outbreak is described through the clinical cases, the microbiological and molecular genetic diagnosis, and the epidemiologic investigation. Minimum inhibitory concentrations for ampicillin, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, third and fourth generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactams, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, co-trimoxazole, colistin and tigecycline were measured. The S. flexneri strains were screened by PCR for TEM, SHV, CTX-M beta-lactamases and plasmidic AmpCs and aac(6')-Ib gene. Serotyping, pulsed field gel-electrophoresis, conjugation assay, plasmid sizing by S1 enzyme digestion and Southern blot hybridization were accomplished.All the S. flexneri isolates proved to be serotype 2 and produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). Carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, tigecycline, colistin, and co-trimoxazole remained active antibiotics. All the strains harboured blaCTX-M-15 and blaOXA-1 genes. The strains hosted two high-molecular weight plasmids of 100 and 230 kb, respectively. According to the hybridization assay blaCTX-M-15 was located on the plasmid of 230 kb. The identical pulsotype verified the presence of outbreak.Remarkable, that one of the food handlers has travelled recently to Pakistan, where ESBL-producing Shigella strains had been reported previously. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first outbreak caused by CTX-M-15-expressing S. flexneri in Spain and as well as in Europe.",

Aerobic culture was carried out for samples taken from the surface of the tonsils by swabs before tonsillectomy for all 20 patients. The squeezed detritus and the tissue samples of removed tonsils, taken separately for the right and left tonsils, were incubated aerobically and anaerobically. The microbiome composition of tissue samples of removed tonsils was also evaluated. Based on the culture results of the deep samples Staphylococcus aureus was the dominating pathogen, besides a great variety of anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria present in the oral microbiota in those patients who underwent tonsillectomy due to distant focal diseases. Microbiome study of the core tissue samples showed a great diversity on genus and species level among patients of the two groups however, S. aureus and Prevotella nigrescens were present in higher proportion in those, whose tonsils were removed due to distant focal diseases. Our results may support previous findings about the possible triggering role of S. aureus and P. nigrescens leading to distant focal diseases. Samples taken by squeezing the tonsils could give more information about the possible pathogenic/triggering bacteria than the surface samples cultured only aerobically.",

It is rarely clinically significant, most commonly affecting hospitalized or immunocompromised patients. The present study aimed to explore the genomic characteristics of a Bulgarian clinical D. acidovorans isolate (designated Dac759) in comparison to all strains of this species with available genomes in the NCBI Genome database (n = 34). Dac759 was obtained in 2021 from the sputum of a 65-year-old female immunocompetent outpatient with bronchitis. Species identification using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and phylogenomic analysis were performed. The isolate demonstrated high-level resistance to colistin (16 mg L-1); resistance to gentamicin; reduced susceptibility to piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin; and susceptibility to imipenem, meropenem, amikacin, and tobramycin. The observed genome size (6.43 Mb) and GC content (66.76%) were comparable with the accessible data from sequenced D. acidovorans genomes. A limited number of resistance determinants were identified in the assembled genome as follows: blaOXA-459, emrE, oqxB, and mexCD-oprJ. The phylogenomic analysis indicated a high heterogenicity of the included D. acidovorans genomes. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented case of a clinically relevant D. acidovorans isolate in Bulgaria. Unlike the majority of reports in the literature, Dac759 affected a patient with no malignancies or other preexisting comorbidities. With this in mind, its genome sequence is a valuable resource for the fundamental study of uncommon bacterial pathogens of public health importance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The incidence of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) caused by multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) has been high in recent years. However, traditional etiological detection methods have not been able to meet the needs for clinical diagnosis and prognosis of LRTIs. The rapid development of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) provides new insights for diagnosis and treatment of LRTIs. We conducted a retrospective study on 95 patients with lower respiratory tract infections caused by MDRO admitted to our respiratory department from January 2022 to December 2023. These patients underwent mNGS testing and conventional culture testing. Additionally, 150 patients without lower respiratory tract infections caused by MDRO during the same period were included as the non-MDRO group. General information was collected, and Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for MDRO infections in patients with lower respiratory tract infections. Our results show that the time to pathogen detection by mNGS was 50.76 ± 1.730 h, that is significantly shorter than 55.53 ± 2.782 h required for conventional culture testing. The pathogen detection rate by mNGS was 89.47% (85/95), higher than the 67.37% (64/95) identified by conventional testing. In terms of pathogen genus distribution, mNGS detected a total of 279 pathogens, while conventional testing detected 121 pathogens. Logistic multivariate regression analysis identified that the use of more than two antibiotics, invasive procedures, invasive mechanical ventilation for ≥7 days, and stay in the respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) for ≥7 days were the main influencing factors for lower respiratory tract infections caused by MDRO ( P &lt; 0.05).",

Aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical and microbiological characteristics of patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) by A. urinae and determine the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the isolates, over the last 3 years at our institution. The medical records and microbiological data of patients from whom A. urinae was isolated from urine cultures at the university hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece, between 2020 and 2022, were retrospectively analyzed. The isolates were identified by the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Susceptibilities for antimicrobial agents were determined by the disk diffusion method and results were interpreted using the 2024 EUCAST breakpoints. The minimum inhibitory concentration for fosfomycin was evaluated by the MIC Test Strip method. A. urinae was encountered in cultures of 24 patients. The median patient's age was 72 years, and females slightly outnumbered males. Underlying diseases such as urologic disease, chronic lung disease, chronic kidney disease, heart disease, diabetes mellitus and dementia were found in 79.2% of patients. Two of the patients did not meet the criteria for a UTI. Susceptibility rates to penicillin, amoxicillin, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, rifampicin, vancomycin, nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin were 100%, 100%, 100%, 83.3%, 79.2%, 100%, 100%, 95.8%, and 91.7%, respectively. Further surveillance studies and clinical trials are needed to confirm our data and to investigate the in vivo efficacy of the antimicrobial agents to treat UTIs by A. urinae .",

    "abstract": "All fungi like eukaryotes possess mitochondria, which are the sites of the oxydative phosphorylation. As eukaryote evolution depends on oxygenic atmosphere, these organisms are primarily aerobic. Except a small group of strict anaerobes (those which lost the capacity of oxydative pathways living in special milieu in association with rumen of grass-eating animals) all fungi can utilize various compounds as carbon sources via oxidative phosphorylation pathways resulting in high energy yield. Certain groups of fungi – i.e. most of the yeasts – under anaerobe conditions, are able to supply themselves with lower levels of fermentation energy, too exhibiting a slow growing capacity utilizing the same amount of carbon source. The mutation of mitochondrial genome or mitochondrial functions encoded by nuclear genes of these fungi might result in a so-calledpetitephenotype producing small colonies on solid media due to their slow growing capacity. These mutants can utilize only fermentable carbon sources. Filamentous fungi have only limited possibilities to produce such phenotypes. ExceptZygomycetes(where the shortage of oxygen induces dimorphic transitions) filamentous fungi can grow and develop their vegetative and sexual reproductive structures only in aerobe milieu. However amongNeurosporaspecies there are several mitochondrial mutations resulting in morphological phenotypes. These are due to the lower energy level provided by the reduced capacity of cytochrome-oxidase enzymes. These mutants (e.g.pokystopper) can be considered aspetiteanalogues. The complete loss of mitochondrial functions – such asrho zerocharacter in yeast – cannot be survived by filamentous fungi.Podospora anserinaand some of its close relatives exhibit a so-calledsenescencephenotype, which means that the growing hyphae in the youngest part of the colonies stop growing and start to die within a short period of time. This phenomenon – discussed below – is also connected to reduced function of mitochondria.The first part of this paper gives a short overview of the genetic organization of mitochondria of fungi, based on the most recent data of three filamentous fungi:Aspergillus nidulansNeurospora crassaandPodospora anserina. Their data are compared to those of the well-characterizedSaccharomyces cerevisiae. In the second part we summarize what we know about other extrachrosomal elements, such as DNA plasmids of various origins and structures, and dsRNAs or virus like particles (VLP). Also discussed are their roles and/or putative functions in the life of the fungi.",

By hybridization using SLT-I and SLT-II probes and PCR method using stx1-2, eae and ehx primers we could differentiate O157 strains of different serotypes into eight (stx, eae, ehxA positive; stx, eae positive; stx, ehxA positive; stx positive; eae, ehxA positive; eae positive; ehxA positive; stx, eae, ehxA negative) types. The discriminatory power of phage typing proves to be much higher than that of the plasmid profile. RAPD typing with different primers could confirm or exclude the subtypes identity of the isolated E. coli O157 serotypes. Escherichia coli O157:HNM isolates could be sorted in six different phage types and six different RAPD types with ERIC-1, in five RAPD types with ERIC-2 and in seven types with M13 primers. Escherichia coli O157:H7 showed six different phage types and three RAPD types with ERIC-1 and ERIC-2 and five types with M13 primers. According to our results the standard PFGE protocol [32] gives the opportunity to differentiate epidemiologically independent but evolutionary related or unrelated isolates, but the practical value of PFGE method for epidemiological purposes must be confirmed by other or more restriction enzymes or using an other protocol. Summarizing our results we suggest the use of phage and RAPD typing and in doubtful cases the PFGE method.",

In this study, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefditoren were determined for a special selection of S. pneumoniae isolates known to be susceptible, moderately susceptible or fully resistant to penicillin; these isolates originated from the lower respiratory tract of adults with pneumonia or the upper respiratory tract of children with or without symptoms of infection. Some of this latter group of isolates exhibited extremely high MICs to penicillin (> or = 32 mg/l), whereas the MICs of cefditoren did not exceed 2 mg/l. The MIC50 and MIC90 of cefditoren proved to be 0.25 and 1.0 mg/l, respectively, with a range of MICs < or = 0.015-2.0 mg/l for all the tested S. pneumoniae isolates. Its good activity suggests that cefditoren is expected to be a potent drug in infections caused by penicillin-resistant and multidrug-resistant S. pneumoniae.",

    "abstract": "ST2 is a member of IL-1 receptor family expressed on Th2 cells and regulates Th2 responces. The gene of ST2 encodes soluble ST2 (sST2) and the transmembrane ST2 (ST2L) isoforms through alternative mRNA splicing. The discovery of IL33/ ST2 signaling pathway, has drawn a great scientific attention to this system. sST2 has been shown to be an indacating factor in various infl ammatory conditions. This study aims to evaluate serum sST2 levels in HTLV-1 infected patients. This study included 49 HTLV-1 seropositive cases of which 14 were sympthomatic. Controls consisted of 30 healthy volunteers. sST2 level was measured using a quantitative ELISA assay and the results of the study groups were compared. Corroborating the previous reports, sST2 was lower in females ( P = 0.003). The sST2 levels was slightly increased in HTLV-1 patients, though such increase was not statistically significant ( P = 0.91), in addition sST2 level did not correlate significantly to the disease duration ( P = 0.78). Despite some other chronic viral infection, HTLV-1 seems not to induce high serum sST2. However owing to relatively high normal variation of sST2 levels and rather small sample size, we stongly recommend further reseach with preferably larger sample size to evalute sST2 in HTLV-1 infected patients.",

During the virus neutralization serological test, blood samples were titrated using permanent virus concentration. Based on the cythopathic effect observed under a light microscope, the antibody level of the patient was assessed. The 100 people examined were classified into 5 groups based on age and type of original vaccine: I. Newborns, no vaccination given; II. Immunosuppressed patients; III. Born before 1986, received only OPV vaccine; IV. Born between 1992–2005, received a combination of OPV and IPV vaccines; V. Born after 2006, received only IPV vaccine. Results show that vaccination coverage meets all the criteria. None of the immunized persons was seronegative to all three polioviruses. Both IPV and OPV vaccines are effective against poliovirus. Blood samples from newborn babies with no immunization were also examined. Results show that most newborns have maternal antibodies in their blood. Results of group II show that immunosuppression does not have a negative influence on blood antibody levels against polioviruses. In spite of the low number of samples, our results show that seroconversion after immunization in the Hungarian population is adequate. For more accurate results about vaccination coverage in the population, further trials would be necessary.",

Polymyxin B use has been commenced in Turkey, although its clinical breakpoint is not listed in the EUCAST. This study aimed to determine the correlation between the MIC values of polymyxin B and colistin. A total of 505 isolates, including 122 isolates of Escherichia coli and 383 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were included in the present study. All the isolates were assessed for colistin and polymyxin B using the broth microdilution method. The categorical agreement in the E. coli isolates was 98.4%, and the rate of very major error was 33.3%. The categorical agreement in the K. pneumoniae isolates was 99.5%, the rate of major error was 0.36%, and the rate of very major error was 0.98%. In the evaluation of the essential agreement, 1.6% error in E. coli and 2.3% error in K. pneumoniae were observed. It was concluded that polymyxin B should never be used in the treatment of the isolates reported as colistin-resistant, and if the MIC values are above 4 mg/L in E. coli and K. pneumoniae . Our results indicate importance of reporting both polymyxin B and colistin susceptibility results of clinical isolates.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We investigated the cases with Aeromonas bacteremia in terms of clinical and microbiological characteristics, underlying disease and mortality rates. Patients with positive blood cultures were included in this research. Aeromonas bacteremia was diagnosed as at least one positive blood culture for Aeromonas species. The bacteremia was defined as community origin if the onset was in the community or within 72 hours of hospital admission. The others were considered as nosocomial. All bacteria were defined as Aeromonas with conventional method. Species identification was verified by VITEK system. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were analyzed with the disc diffusion, E-test method or VITEK system. Thirty-three patients were diagnosed with bacteremia due to Aeromonas spp. Hematologic and solid tumors were the leading underlying conditions, followed by cirrhosis. Two patients (6%) had community-acquired infections. Aeromonas hydrophila was the most common isolated bacterium. The crude mortality rate was 36%. 12 patients died and 6 deaths and 4 deaths were detected in patients with bacteremia caused by A. hydrophila and Aeromonas sobria respectively. All strains were resistant to ampicillin and more than 90% of the strains were susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fluoroquinolone, third generation cephalosporins, and carbapenems. Aeromonas sp. is not a frequent cause of bacteremia however, it may lead to high mortality rates, especially in the immunocompromised hosts and patients with liver cirrhosis. Nosocomial Aeromonas bacteremia is not uncommon in these populations. Broad-spectrum cephalosporins, piperacillin-tazobactam, fluoroquinolones, and carbapenems remain as effective antimicrobial agents for therapy of Aeromonas bacteremia.",

Its coincidence with the far-reaching political and economic changes that took place at that time suggested a link between the two events.Hungary, where these infections had had low incidence before the period investigated, also experienced an increase in STD incidence.The trend in syphilis infection during the 20 years between 1985–2004, that preceded the turn of the millennium and when finally Hungary joined the European Union, have been analyzed. Due to the nature of venereological epidemiological surveillance in Hungary, syphilis prevalence data are appropriate for further analysis from socio-demographic aspects.Behavioural changes underlying the specific features of the epidemics in Hungary had developed several years earlier and cannot be linked to the political and economic changes that started in the early 90s. The only exception is the phenomenon of growing migration that appeared simultaneously with the political changes and had a decisive impact on the spread and level of infection in some areas in the country. As shown by our data, trends seen in specific demographic groups (females, rural population) preceded the suddenly occurring political changes by about 15 years.",

    "abstract": "The order Agaricales is the most species-rich group of the Basidiomycota, numbering ca.480 genera and 14,000 described species.Extremely diverse fungi belong to this order, bearing highly distinct morphologies and displaying life history traits which show considerable diversity, yet the driving forces of evolutionary diversification in these mushrooms are poorly known.Understanding why and how certain lineages became extremely species-rich, while others are only represented by a few species, determining the timing of major lineage expansions, or the impact of fruiting body morphologies on speciation rates may have an effect on fungal conservation and taxonomy, however, theoretical and experimental evidence so far remained spurious.A recently launched 4-year project, ADiv, aims to investigate patterns of speciation, extinction and variations in the rate of evolution in the Agaricales.To address these questions, we will use statistical models of lineage diversification in a phylogenetic framework.Modeling of diversification will rely on a new two-gene dataset (referred to as diversity dataset) for ca.3,000 species accepted in the Agaricales.For molecular investigations we have selected the nLSU and RPB2 loci, which are known to provide sufficient phylogenetic information for relationships at the intrageneric level.In addition to the diversity dataset, a phylogenomic dataset is also being produced, which will provide robust support for the backbone of the Agaricales to reinforce phylogenetic inference from the diversity dataset.These two datasets will allow us to examine general patterns of speciation and extinction, to identify shifts in diversification rates and whether transitions between different fruiting body types have an effect on rates of speciation and extinction in the Agaricales.In this contribution, we report an experimental workflow designed specifically for the Agaricales, progress in generating sequence data and preliminary results about adaptive radiations in the Agaricales.",

    "abstract": "Comparative genomic studies enable us to better understand how genomes function and evolve.Although the sequencing processes become more and more accurate and fast, assembling of draft genomic sequences remains a serious challenge in many cases.However, this task is worth the effort, because it allows us to perform extensive and thorough comparative evolutionary studies, as more complete understanding can be obtained by comparing entire genomes.The fission yeasts (Schizosaccharomyces) provide an interesting model for genome evolution as they belong to one of the basal groups of Ascomycota (Taphrinomycotina) and have a distinct life history from other yeasts.If we compare them to the genus Saccharomyces, they are as different from each other as they are from animals.Schizosaccharomyces cryophilus is a relatively new, recently described fission yeast species so named for its preference for growth at lower temperatures compared with its other relatives.Although S. cryophilus is morphologically similar to S. octosporus, analysis of several rapidly evolving sequences revealed significant divergence from any previously characterized Schizosaccharomyces strains.The genome of the fission yeast species have been sequenced and assembled recently, except the S. cryophilus genome, as the scaffolds of its sequence was not assembled into complete chromosomes.It has been also reported that fission yeasts could have unusually stable genome structures because conservation of the gene content in their genomes is significantly high.Here we suggest a hypothetic genome assembly of S. cryophilus depending on synteny relationships and common genomic features.We created pairwise whole genome alignments with the Mauve aligner using either the sequence of S. pombe or S. octosporus as reference genomes.Furthermore, we identified the subtelomeric and centromeric contig ends of S. cryophilus and we used them as anchor points for the assembly.Thereafter we validated our hypothesis with PCR using sequence specific primers annealed to contig ends and karyotypic analysis combined with Southernhybridization.Finally, we introduced some new genome characteristics of S. cryophilus by comparing the assembled genome to the other related genomes.Our analysis clearly pointed out that S. cryophilus is more similar to S. octosporus than to S. pombe not only in sequence identity but also in gene order.We observed that the genome of S. cryophilus underwent approximately equal number of rearrangement events as S. octosporus compared with S. pombe.The alignments suggested that the main chromosomal rearrangements occurred between the species were interchromosomal translocations.Surprisingly, examples of large-scale inversions between the genomes of S. cryophilus and S. octosporus seemed to be very rare.Considering the extent/scale of the sequence divergence and the number of rearrangements found in the fission yeasts, we supposed that their structural and sequence evolution are correlated at least in the case of the above three species.",

An observed drop in intracellular GTP and/or ATP may be an element of the signal transduction pathway leading to an increase in surface hydrophilicity in response to environmental stresses. Attachment of cells to soil particles under salt stress conditions is strongly influenced by the degS/degU two-component system, which thereby provides a mechanism for the bacteria to escape from the hostile environment.",

Fungi have been successfully employed for heterologous expression of various proteins from different origin including higher eukaryotes [2, 3]. Looking for suitable expression hosts for the production of plant derived hydroxynitrillyases (Hnl) of Hevea brasiliensis (S-selective Hnl) and of Prunus amygdalus (R-selective Hnl), we cloned the structural genes into various bacterial and fungal expression systems. E. coli hostvector systems allowed high-level Hnl protein production but mostly as inactive inclusion bodies. Expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiaecould be achieved at medium levels using a constitutive pgk promoter based autonomously replicating vector. Expression experiments in filamentous ascomycetes such as Aspergillus niger or Penicillium chysogenum using standard expression vectors resalted in rather poor levels. However, we were able to show that expression of H. brasiliensis Hnl from a regulated fungal promoter was highly dependent on proper 3 terminator elements. The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is a well-developed expression system suitable for large-scale production of proteins [4]. We were able to construct a highly",

    "abstract": "Roots of classical yeast genetics go back to the early work of Lindegreen in the 1930s, who studied thallism, sporulation and inheritance of wine yeast strains belonging to S. cerevisiae.Consequent mutation and hybridization of heterothallic S. cerevisae strains resulted in the discovery of life cycle and mating type system, as well as construction of the genetic map.Elaboration of induced mutation and controlled hybridization of yeast strains opened up new possibilities for the genetic analysis of technologically important properties and for the production of improved industrial strains, but a big drawback was the widely different genetic properties of laboratory and industrial yeast strains.Genetic analysis and mapping of industrial strains were generally hindered because of homothallism, poor sporulation and/or low spore viability of brewing and wine yeast strains [1, 2].In spite of this, there are a few examples of the application of sexual hybridization in the study of genetic control of important technological properties, e.g.sugar utilization, flocculation and flavor production in brewing yeast strains [3] or in the improvement of ethanol producing S. cerevisiae strains [4].Rare mating and application of karyogamy deficient (kar -) mutants also proved useful in strain improvement [5].Importance of yeasts in biotechnology is enormous.This includes food and beverage fermentation processes where a wide range of yeast species are playing role, but S. cerevisiae is undoubtedly the most important species among them.New biotechnology is aiming to improve these technologies, but besides this, a completely new area of yeast utilization has been emerged, especially in the pharmaceutical and medical areas.Without decreasing the importance of S. cerevisiae, numerous other yeast species, e.g.Kluyveromyces lactis, Hansenula polymorpha, Pichia pastoris, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Yarrowia lipolytica have gained increasing potentialities in the modern fermentation biotechnology [6].",

    "abstract": "Two types of actinophages, phi S and phi L, were isolated from soil samples by using Streptomyces scabies MR13, a potato scab pathogen, as an indicator strain. The phages were partially characterized according to their physicochemical properties, plaques and particles morphology and their host-range. The host-range of these phages was narrow for phi S and wide for phi L. The adsorption rate constants of the phi S and phi L were 3.44 x 10(-9) and 3.18 x 10(-9) ml/min, and their burst sizes were 1.61 and 3.75 virions, respectively. One-step growth indicated that phi S and phi L have a latent period of 30 min followed by a rise period of 30 min. The temperate character of these phages was tested in other isolates of Streptomyces. Four of the phages (phi SS3, phi SS12, phi SS13 and phi SS17) were identified as temperate phages, since they were able to lysogenize SS3, SS12, SS13 and SS17. phi SS3, phi SS12 and phi SS13 were homoimmune, and they were heteroimmune with respect to phi SS17. The restriction barriers of lysogenic isolates (SS12, SS13 and SS17) interfered with the blockage of plaques formation by phages (phi SS12, phi SS13 or phi SS17) propagated on them, about 75% of lysogenic isolates had restriction systems. The exposure of the lysogenic isolates (SS12, SS13 and SS17) to UV-irradiation prevented the possible restriction barriers of these isolates, and these barriers could be overcome.",

This study was focused on in vitro testing sensitivity of streptococci isolated from AOM to enterocins produced by 9 different origin strains of E. faecium. Enterocins (Ent) represent ribosomally synthesized proteinaceous substances with antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and/or Gram-negative bacteria which are produced mostly by strains of the species Enterococcus faecium. Str. pneumoniae were sensitive at least to 1 Ent. Str. pneumoniae SPn 754 was sensitive to 5 Ent. Five Str. pyogenes were sensitive to enterocins. Ent A (P) inhibited the growth of 3 Str. pneumoniae, and 4 Str. pyogenes (activity between 100 and 3,200 AU/ml). Most of Ent inhibited the growth of streptococci tested (100-3,200 AU/ml). Str. pyogenes were more sensitive to Ent than Str. pneumoniae. Although more detailed further studies are required, our results indicate a new possibility for enterocin use.",

This system regulates gene expression in response to external C 4 -dicarboxylates. During entry into stationary phase Gram-negative bacteria express genes that impart cellular resistance to environmental stresses. In E. coli , 50 or more genes are triggered by sigma factor ( sigma s ) during entry into stationary phase. Multi-copy dcuS-lacZ and chromosomally integrated dcuS-lacZ fusions analysis showed that the expression of dcuSR is positively regulated during growth phase. Many genes that are required for stationary-phase adaptation are controlled by RpoS, a conserved alternative sigma factor, whose expression is, in turn, controlled by many factors. To understand whether the dcuSR is dependent upon RpoS, a RpoS- dcuS-lacZ strain was generated. beta -Galactosidase assay and Western blot analysis reported that the generated RpoS- dcuS-lacZ strain and the wild type showed the same expression during stationary phase. Surprisingly, the growth phase-dependence of the expression of dcuSR is still present in RpoS- dcuS-lacZ strain suggesting that other growth-phase-dependent regulatory mechanisms (might be the DcuSR system or cAMP/CRP), in addition to RpoS, may control post-exponential dcuSR expression.",

Appendix biopsies were obtained from the patients with clinically diagnosed as acute appendicitis and subjects admitted for elective abdominal surgery. All biopsies from the patients were non-perforated and histologically divided into acute and non-acute appendicitis. Granzyme B expression was assessed immunohistochemically. The results showed that granzyme B expression in both acute and non-acute appendicitis was significantly lower than that in the control appendix tissues ( P <0.05). The expression of this cytotoxic protein in acute and non-acute appendicitis was comparable ( P >0.05). Therefore, the results of the present study suggest that reduced expression of granzyme B in non-perforated appendicitis may reflect low cytotoxic activities which may prevent tissue damage.",

    "abstract": "Disposal of used geothermal waters in Hungary often means temporary storage in reservoir lakes to reduce temperature and improve water quality. In this study, the physical and chemical properties and changes in the bacterial community structure of a reservoir lake system in southeast region of Hungary were monitored and compared through 2 years, respectively. The values of biological oxygen demand, concentrations of ammonium ion, total inorganic nitrogen, total phosphorous, and total phenol decreased, whereas oxygen saturation, total organic nitrogen, pH, and conductivity increased during the storage period. Bacterial community structure of water and sediment samples was compared by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) following the amplification of the 16S rRNA gene. According to the DGGE patterns, greater seasonal than spatial differences of bacterial communities were revealed in both water and sediment of the lakes. Representatives of the genera Arthrospira and Anabaenopsis (cyanobacteria) were identified as permanent and dominant members of the bacterial communities.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic genomes evolve through accumulation of small-scale changes like point mutations, nucleotide insertions and deletions in their sequences.On the other hand, chromosomal rearrangements (inversions, translocations, fusions and fissions) can also contribute to reshuffling of the gene order.It is widely assumed that there is correlation between nucleotide and structural evolution.However, counterexamples coming from comparative sequence analyses were also revealed.As each genome has their own uniqueness, further investigation of genome evolution can help us to better understand how the different genomes were organized and changed, when and why natural selection acted.The fission yeasts (Schizosaccharomyces) form an ancient clade within the Ascomycete fungi and have a distinct life history from other yeasts.It has been reported that conservation of the gene content within Schizosaccharomyces is significantly higher than that within Saccharomyces or Kluyveromyces.Moreover, gene order and gene structure of the fission yeasts are also more conserved than expected from levels of their amino acid divergences.These observations suggest that fission yeast amino acid sequences evolve anomalously fast or that their genome structures are unusually stable.Thus, stable genome structures of fission yeasts could be consequences of insufficient rearrangements, and because of this the perceived genome conservation is just a remnant of the ancestral gene order.According to another scenario, genetic rearrangements could occur frequently, but the ancient gene order still was maintained by natural selection.In order to gain more information on the topic of genome evolution of the fission yeasts, a comparative study of sequences was carried out.Sequences of 30 fungal species of several different clades were compared and sequence evolution and genome rearrangements were investigated.We created global and genus level phylogenetic trees using the concatenated sequences of 18 putative orthologues.In addition to that, we performed whole genome alignments among the species and estimated the minimum number of rearrangements occurred by the help of locally collinear blocks found (chromosomal fragments, which does not contain any rearrangements).Thereafter, we compared the branch lengths of the phylogenetic trees to the number of rearrangements.Our results suggest that it was not only amino acid sequences of the fission yeasts that were evolving fast but their genomes were also undergoing numerous rearrangements.That is, observed conservation of the gene content and gene order within the fission yeasts probably does not come from incomplete genome reshuffling.We assume that stable genome structures of the Schizosaccharomyces species are likely to have been maintained by natural selection rather than as a result of the fact that there had been few chromosomal rearrangements during their evolution.",

Limited numbers of comprehensive population-based studies are available related to HEV seroepidemiology, especially from Central Europe.The aim of this study was to investigate the seroprevalence and trends of total and IgM antibodies against HEV in different age groups in the population of South Transdanubia, Hungary, within a thirteen years long period between the years 2010 and 2022.We retrospectively analysed the serological test results of HEV total and HEV IgM antibodies carried out by ELISA technique using Dia.Pro (Diagnostic Bioprobes, Italy) kit from serum samples collected from patients with or without hepatitis between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2022.The number of tested samples (∑6,996 for total antibody and ∑6,582 for IgM) increased during the study period. The average HEV total and the IgM antibody seropositivities were 33% (2,307/6,996 samples) and 9.6% (642/6,582 samples), respectively, in the study population. The HEV total antibody seropositivity varied in different age groups between 3.9% (age group 1-5 years) and 58.6% (86-90 years) and showed an increasing positivity by age. At the age groups >50 years, nearly half (43%) of the population had antibodies against HEV. The HEV IgM positivity had an increasing trend of up to 13.9% in the age group 81-85 years.High HEV total and IgM antibody seroprevalence were detected in South Transdanubia, Hungary, confirming that this region is highly endemic for HEV infections in Europe.",

HAV genomic RNA was successfully detected in 216/400 (54%) sera by RT-PCR subsequently confirmed by sequencing. The complete nucleotide sequences of VP1 region were determined in 32 representative HAV strains.

Based on the combined epidemiological and molecular data, epidemic, endemic, and imported HAV strains were also characterized. The first two registered countrywide outbreaks started among men-sex-with men (MSM) in 2011 (sub-genotype IA) and 2021 (sub-genotype IB), the continuously circulating endemic/domestic HAV strain (sub-genotype IA) in East Hungary and the travel-related sub-genotype IB strains from Egypt should be highlighted. All HAV strains are deposited in the HAVNET database (https://www.rivm.nl/en/havnet).In this 20-year-long comprehensive molecular epidemiological study, we report the genetic characterization and geographic distribution of endemic, epidemic and imported HAV strains for the first time in Hungary with continuous co-circulation of sub-genotypes IA and IB HAV strains since 2003.

The objective of this investigation was to determine the antibacterial resistance profile and genetic variability of the S. aureus isolated from adult patients with otitis externa (OE) and otitis media (OM) infections, Tehran- Iran. The disk diffusion was employed to detect the susceptibility of 45 S. aureus strains. Biofilm production was evaluated by microtiter plate assay. Genetic diversity of the isolates was determined by staphylococcal cassette SCC mec , spa , and MLST techniques. Resistance to mupirocin and vancomycin were identified in 40 and 2.2% of isolates. Out of the 45 S. aureus isolates, 41 (91.2%) strains were considered as positive biofilm strains at different levels. According to our results, S. aureus isolated from OM (44.4%, 20/45) were including CC8/ST239-SCC mec III corresponded to spa types t860, t030, t037, t234, t421 (70%, 14/20) and CC/ST30-SCC mec IV corresponded to spa types t605 and t019 (30%, 6/20) while S. aureus isolated from OE (55.6%, 25/45) were including CC/ST30-SCC mec IV corresponded to spa types t605, t345 and t1130 (52%, 13/25), CC/ST22-SCC mec IV corresponded to spa type t790 (20%, 5/25), CC8/ST8-SCC mec IV corresponded to spa type t008 (16%, 4/25), and CC/ST45-SCC mec IV corresponded to spa types t004 and t038 (12%, 3/25). This study highlighted genetic variability and strong biofilm formation ability among our isolates revealing its crucial role in enhancing the resistance of this bacteria to drugs. Thus, it is necessary to continue the epidemiological analysis to improve the control of ear infections related to S. aureus .",

VITEK 2 compact system and Kirby-Bauer (K-B) disk diffusion were used for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Whole genome sequencing was carried out using the Illumina platform NovaSeq sequencer. Abricate software was used for the prediction of antibiotic resistance genes of three CR-ROR strains. The phylogenetic tree was constructed through genome SNPs to investigate the genetic relationship of three CR-ROR strains. Three CR-ROR (WF1357, WF2441, and WF3367) strains were collected in this study. Two strains were isolated from neurosurgery (WF1357 and WF2441), and one was isolated from pulmonology department (WF3367). All strains harboured multiple antibiotic resistance genes. Two strains (WF1357, WF2441) carried the blaNDM-1 gene, one of the strains (WF3367) carried the blaKPC-2 gene. Three CR-RORs were resistant to different antimicrobial agents including carbapenems. The three CR-ROR strains collected in this study and 51 CR-ROR strain genomes downloaded from NCBI, were divided into six evolutionary groups (A-F). In this study, three CR-ROR strains were found to have a higher level of resistance to antibacterial agents and carried multiple antibiotic resistance genes. The CR-ROR strains carrying multiple antibacterial resistant genes require the stringent monitoring to avoid the spread of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains.",

In this study, 49 streptococcal isolates that were considered as atypical S. pneumoniae were analyzed by: optochin susceptibility in ambient and 5% CO2 atmosphere, oxgall disk sensitivity, PCR targeting several genes and antimicrobial susceptibility.The combined results of biochemical and molecular methods showed the presence of 23 S. pneumoniae, 7 S. pseudopneumoniae, and 19 other mitis group. Among S. pseudopneumoniae, all isolates were collected from respiratory tract samples and showed a high level of resistance to β-lactams with a MIC90 of 32 mg L-1. Two isolates of S. pseudopneumoniae showed the typical phenotype of optochin resistance described in the literature. All isolates could be identified only by molecular tests. Among Streptococcus pneumonaie, all strains harbored the lytA gene and the Spn9802 fragment. But only 14 strains were encapsulated.This study describes several assays for the identification of atypical pneumococci in order to gain insights on the nature of isolate and raise alert about the presence of these strains in the pediatric Tunisian community.",

    "abstract": "Hormones, characteristic to higher ranked animals, are synthesized, stored, and secreted by unicellular eukaryote animals. The unicells also have receptors for recognizing these materials and transmit the message into the cells for provoking response. The hormones are effective in very low concentrations (down to 10–21 M) and opposite effects of lower and higher concentrations can be observed. However, sometimes linear concentration effects can be found, which means that hormesis exists, nevertheless uncertain, as it is in the phase of formation (evolutionary experimentation). Hormesis, by transformation (fixation) of cytoplasmic receptor-like membrane components to receptors in the presence of the given hormone, likely helps the development of unicellular endocrine character and by this the evolution of endocrine system. The effect by extremely low concentrations of hormones had been forced by the watery way of unicellular life, which could establish the physiological concentrations of hormones in the blood of higher ranked animals. This means that hormetic low doses are the normal, effective concentrations and the high concentrations are artificial, consequently could be dangerous.",

    "abstract": "Chronic granulomatous disease is a non-prevalent genetic disorder due to different structural gene mutations encoding components of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase complex. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase is a complex made by a group of five proteins (subunit) and plays an important role in the innate immune system. Five structural genes are responsible for encoding each subunit, in which cytochrome b-245 alpha chain (also known as p22-phox) is encoded by CYBA gene. CYBA gene mutation leads to a group of autosomal dominant chronic granulomatous disease. Decreased level or lack of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase leaves affected individuals vulnerable to many types of infections and excessive inflammation. In this study, a family affected by BCGitis caused by a novel intronic autosomal recessive CYBA mutation (88,713,158 C > T) has been described. The proband is a 5-year-old girl with chronic granulomatous disease who was referred to the clinic due to BCGitis. The culprit mutation was detected following whole genome sequencing and was confirmed among the family members by Sanger sequencing. Being symptom-free at the time of diagnosis, despite the proband's mother homozygosity, was a characteristic feature of this report. Remarkably, none of the CYBA-mutated members, as a known chronic granulomatous disease causing gene, has expressed symptoms other than regional lymph node enlargements. This might explain the gene mutation site importance in demonstrating different manifestations.",

    "abstract": "Comparative genomic studies enable us to better understand how genomes function and evolve.Although the sequencing processes become more and more accurate and fast, assembling of draft genomic sequences remains a serious challenge in many cases.However, this task is worth the effort, because it allows us to perform extensive and thorough comparative evolutionary studies, as more complete understanding can be obtained by comparing entire genomes.The fission yeasts (Schizosaccharomyces) provide an interesting model for genome evolution as they belong to one of the basal groups of Ascomycota (Taphrinomycotina) and have a distinct life history from other yeasts.If we compare them to the genus Saccharomyces, they are as different from each other as they are from animals.Schizosaccharomyces cryophilus is a relatively new, recently described fission yeast species so named for its preference for growth at lower temperatures compared with its other relatives.Although S. cryophilus is morphologically similar to S. octosporus, analysis of several rapidly evolving sequences revealed significant divergence from any previously characterized Schizosaccharomyces strains.The genome of the fission yeast species have been sequenced and assembled recently, except the S. cryophilus genome, as the scaffolds of its sequence was not assembled into complete chromosomes.It has been also reported that fission yeasts could have unusually stable genome structures because conservation of the gene content in their genomes is significantly high.Here we suggest a hypothetic genome assembly of S. cryophilus depending on synteny relationships and common genomic features.We created pairwise whole genome alignments with the Mauve aligner using either the sequence of S. pombe or S. octosporus as reference genomes.Furthermore, we identified the subtelomeric and centromeric contig ends of S. cryophilus and we used them as anchor points for the assembly.Thereafter we validated our hypothesis with PCR using sequence specific primers annealed to contig ends and karyotypic analysis combined with Southernhybridization.Finally, we introduced some new genome characteristics of S. cryophilus by comparing the assembled genome to the other related genomes.Our analysis clearly pointed out that S. cryophilus is more similar to S. octosporus than to S. pombe not only in sequence identity but also in gene order.We observed that the genome of S. cryophilus underwent approximately equal number of rearrangement events as S. octosporus compared with S. pombe.The alignments suggested that the main chromosomal rearrangements occurred between the species were interchromosomal translocations.Surprisingly, examples of large-scale inversions between the genomes of S. cryophilus and S. octosporus seemed to be very rare.Considering the extent/scale of the sequence divergence and the number of rearrangements found in the fission yeasts, we supposed that their structural and sequence evolution are correlated at least in the case of the above three species.",

The protective effect of the recombinant fusion protein ESAT6-CFP10-dIFN produced in a prokaryotic expression system (Escherichia coli) has been assessed in a guinea pig model of acute tuberculosis. The tested antigen comprises the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins ESAT6 and CFP10 as well as modified human γ-interferon (dIFN) for boosting the immune response. Double intradermal immunization of animals with the tested fusion protein (2 × 0.5 μg) induces a protective effect against subsequent Mtb infection. The immunized animals do not develop the symptoms of acute tuberculosis and their body weight gain was five times more as compared with the non-immunized-infected animals. The animal group immunized with this dose of antigen displays the minimum morphological changes in the internal organs and insignificant inflammatory lesions in the liver tissue, which complies with a decrease in the bacterial load in the spleen and average Mtb counts in macrophages.",

This cross-sectional study from January to September 2018 was performed on 59 A. baumannii strains isolated from clinical samples in the north of Iran. Isolates were identified by standard microbiologic tests and molecular method. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out by disk diffusion and broth microdilution methods. The presence of carbapenem resistance genes was detected by PCR method. All isolates were resistant to cefepime, meropenem, imipenem and ceftazidime. The lowest resistance rate was observed against doxycycline with 33.9%. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) results showed that all carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) isolates were susceptible to colistin with MIC50 and MIC90 values of 1/2 µg/mL. Among 59 CRAB, bla OXA-23-like was the most prevalent gene (86.4%) followed by bla OXA-24-like (69.5%). Meanwhile, none of the clinical isolates harbored bla OXA-58-like gene. We found a high prevalence of CRAB strains harboring OXA-type carbapenemases in the north of Iran. Our results suggests that the presence of OXA-type genes was not directly correlated with the increase of imipenem MIC level, but can be clinically important as they contribute to the selection of CRAB strains.",

In this institution--as in all organizations affiliated with the Rockefeller Institute--the state of art diagnostic work together with research focusing on problems derived from everyday medical and public health practice was considered as to be of primary importance. Stimulated by this scientific environment Rauss's interest turned towards enteric pathogens. In cooperation with Lovrekovics he developed a typhoid vaccine containing a trichloracetic acid extract of the pathogen adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide. This vaccine was introduced in 1938 when ca. 6-8000 enteric fever cases were registered in Hungary annually. The vaccination, supported by the public health work concerning carriers, eventually lead to the eradication of the disease in Hungary.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Helicobacter pylori is a common pathogen causing gastric inflammation and malignancy. Fetuin-A is a multifunctional protein that is involved in the regulation of calcification, insulin resistance and inflammation. Reports on serum levels of fetuin-A in acute H. pylori infection are contradictory. We intended to see whether H. pylori post-infection status has a long-term effect on serum fetuin-A levels in a well-characterized series of systemic lupus erythematosus cases. In this cross-sectional study 117 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus were enrolled. Helicobacter infection status and serum fetuin-A concentration were determined by ELISA and radial immunodiffusion, respectively. H. pylori positive patients had higher serum fetuin-A concentration than negative ones: 517 (456–603) vs. 476 (408–544) mg L −1 , median (25–75% percentiles), P = 0.020. No other parameters differed between these groups. During univariate regression analysis fetuin-A levels were associated with Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), White blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), serum total protein, albumin, and the SLEDAI index at the time of diagnosis but only serum albumin remained a significant determinant in multivariate regression study.",

The sequenced genome of C. fetus subsp. fetus MMM01 along with reference genomes retrieved from NCBI was subjected to various in-silico analysis including JSpecies, MLST server, PATRIC server, VFanalyzer, CARD, PHASTER to understand their phylogenetic relation, virulence and antimicrobial resistance profile. The genome had a size of 1,788,790 bp, with a GC content of 33.09%, nearly identical to the reference strain C. fetus subsp. fetus 82-40. The MLST based phylogenetic tree constructed revealed the polyphyletic branching and MMM01 (ST25) was found to be closely related to ST11, both belong to the sap-A serotype which are more common in human infections. VFanalyzer identified 88 protein-coding genes coding for several virulence factors including Campylobacter adhesion to fibronectin, flagellar apparatus, cytolethal distending toxin operons and Campylobacter invasion antigen proteins which enhance the virulence of bacteria along with resistance genes against antibiotics including fluoroquinolone, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and aminoglycoside in MMM01, which points to enhanced survival and pathogenicity of this zoonotic pathogen. It was interesting to find that MMM01 lacked FGI-II island found in most of the clinical isolates, which encoded CRISPR Cas and prophage II regions. More details about the complexity and evolution of this zoonotic pathogen could be learned from future studies that concentrate on comparative genome analysis using larger genome datasets.",

The aim of this study was to assess the extent of dissemination of MRSA isolated from burn patients in Burn Intensive Care Unit in Tunisia and to evaluate the frequency of virulence and antibiotics resistance genes. Among the 72 S. aureus isolates analyzed in the study, 54% were MRSA. The majority of MRSA (94.8%) were multidrug resistant and they had a high resistance rates to kanamycin (94.8%), tobramycin (90%), tetracycline (94.8%) and ciprofloxacin and rifampicin (87%, each). The gene aac(6')-Ie-aph(2″)-Ia conferring resistance to kanamycine and tobtamycin were detected in all isolates and the aph(3')-Ia gene conferring resistance to gentamicin were detected in 2.8% of resistant isolates. Tetracycline resistance genes tet(M), tet(K) and tet(L) were detected in 100%, 10.8% and 2.8% of the isolates, respectively. The SCCmec type III and the agr type I were the most predominant (69.2% and 90%, respectively). The 27 SCCmecIII-agrI isolates were clustered into two PFGE types A and B. The two representative isolates of PFGE clusters A and B belonged to ST239-t037 and ST241-t037 respectively. As conclusion, our results showed a high prevalence of MRSA in trauma burn intensive care unit belonging to two multidrug resistant clones ST239/ST241-agrI-t037-SCCmecIII MRSA. We also demonstrated that MRSA was disseminated between burn patients.",

Three years later its activity was broadened--on ground of the experiences--to cover the total field of hygiene, thus we had to establish the \"mycologia hygienica\" (hygienic mycology), however, this has not been accepted as an independent discipline. Here a short, selected overview is given of our experiences. In the following the trends of the activity is demonstrated along the subdivisions of hygiene (epidemiology, environmental-hygiene, professional and occupational-, nutritional and food hygiene). In respect of hygiene, however, the fungi play a Janus-faced (more exactly Dr. Jekyll-Mr. Hyde) role, as they can behave not only harmful but also beneficial.",

Yet, all these plant pathogens, having different systematic positions within the livings, are of significance as far as agricultural crop production is concerned.Mycologists in the past were primarily interested in identifying fungal diseases, describing the fungi, studying their life cycle in relation to environment and looking for effective control measures. A big step forward was when investigations expanded toward the physiology of plant diseases and disease resistance. Meanwhile fungal genetics has developed providing a better understanding of plant-fungus relations. Recently, with the introduction of molecular techniques, new approaches of research, such as molecular taxonomy and molecular genetics have been established and the molecular methods were applied in other related fields of studies.For the illustration of changes in research interest worldwide, the main research topics and all the contributions (poster presentations) accepted at and published by the 7th International Congress of Plant Pathology held in Edinburgh, Scotland between 9-16 August 1998 have been scanned. Based on these, some of the most promising research trends with a few examples will be accounted here and then a short overview of what has recently been done by Hungarian mycologists on the subject will be given.",

Immunization of mice with GEP induced an antibody response one month after primary immunization, as observed by cross-reactivity. Our findings suggest that MAGEP is related to a latent hypersensitivity reaction and an increased risk of mycobacterial infection susceptibility.

    "abstract": "Abstract Staphylococcus aureus as an opportunistic bacterial pathogen with intrinsic and acquired resistance to many antibiotics is a worldwide problem. The current study was undertaken to evaluate the resistance pattern, and determine the genetic types of multidrug-resistant S. aureus isolated from wound. This cross-sectional study was conducted over the period of two years (from December 2018 to November 2020) at the hospitals affiliated to Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. In present study, 75 multidrug-resistant S. aureus isolates collected from wound infections were investigated. Phenotypic resistance was assessed by Kirby–Bauer disk diffusion method. Conventional PCR was performed for the detection of virulence encoding genes. Genotyping of strains was performed based on coa gene polymorphism using multiplex-PCR assay. SCC mec typing, spa typing and MLST were also used to characterize the genotype of the mupirocin, tigecycline and vancomycin resistant multidrug-resistant S. aureus isolates. All 75 multidrug-resistant S. aureus isolates in the study were confirmed as MRSA. Coagulase typing distinguished isolates into five genotypic patterns including III (40%), I (24%), IVb (16%), V (10.7%) and type X (9.3%). Resistance to tigecycline was detected in 4% of MDR-MRSA isolates and all belonged to CC8/ST239- SCC mec III/t421 lineage. According to our analysis, one VRSA strain was identified that belonged to coa type V and CC/ST22-SCC mec IV/t790 lineage. Resistance to mupirocin was detected in 9.3% of strains. All 7 mupirocin resistant MDR-MRSA isolates exhibited resistance to mupirocin in high level. Of these, 4 isolates belonged to CC/ST8-SCC mec IV/t008 (57.1%), 2 isolates belonged to CC/ST8-SCC mec IV/t064 (28.6%) and one isolate to CC/ST22-SCC mec IV/t790 (14.3%). Altogether, current survey provides a snapshot of the characteristics of S. aureus strains isolated from patients. Our observations highlighted type III as predominant coa type among multidrug-resistant MDR strains indicating low heterogeneity of these isolates. Our study also indicates the importance of continuous monitoring of the genotypes of MDR-MRSA isolates to prevent nosocomial outbreaks and the spread of MDR isolates.",
