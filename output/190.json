    "abstract": "Plants living under natural conditions are exposed to many adverse factors that interfere with the photosynthetic process, leading to declines in growth, development, and yield. The recent development of Chlorophyll a fluorescence (ChlF) represents a potentially valuable new approach to study the photochemical efficiency of leaves. Specifically, the analysis of fluorescence signals provides detailed information on the status and function of Photosystem II (PSII) reaction centers, light-harvesting antenna complexes, and both the donor and acceptor sides of PSII. Here, we review the results of fast ChlF analyses of photosynthetic responses to environmental stresses, and discuss the potential scientific and practical applications of this innovative methodology. The recent availability of portable devices has significantly expanded the potential utilization of ChlF techniques, especially for the purposes of crop phenotyping and monitoring.",

    "abstract": "This review paper is focused predominantly on the role of the cell wall in the defense response of plants to trace metals. It is generally known that this compartment accumulates toxic divalent and trivalent metal cations both during their uptake by the cell from the environment and at the final stage of their sequestration from the protoplast. However, from results obtained in recent years, our understanding of the role played by the cell wall in plant defense response to toxic metals has markedly altered. It has been shown that this compartment may function not only as a sink for toxic trace metal accumulation, but that it is also actively modified under trace metal stress. These modifications lead to an increase in the capacity of the cell wall to accumulate trace metals and a decrease of its permeability for trace metal migration into the protoplast. One of the most striking alterations is the enhancement of the level of low-methylesterified pectins: the polysaccharides able to bind divalent and trivalent metal ions. This review paper will present the most recent results, especially those that are concerned with polysaccharide level, composition and distribution under trace metal stress, and describe in detail the polysaccharides responsible for metal binding and immobilization in different groups of plants (algae and higher plants). The review also contains information related to the entry pathways of trace metals into the cell wall and their detection methods.",

    "abstract": "Plant responses to abiotic stresses are very complex phenomena with individual characteristics for various species. Abiotic stresses (e.g. drought, salinity, flooding, cold, heat, UV radiation, heavy metals, etc.) strongly affect plant growth and development. It is estimated that they are the cause of more than 50 % of crop yield losses. Abiotic stresses are known to activate a multigene response resulting in the changes in various proteins and primary and secondary metabolite accumulation. Therefore, proteomic and metabolomic approaches are becoming very important and powerful tools used in studying plants' reaction to various stimuli. Precise analysis of proteome and metabolome is essential for understanding the fundamentals of stress physiology and biochemistry. In this review, we focus on recent reports concerned to the influence of abiotic stresses on changes in the level of different protein groups and metabolite classes. Basic information about physicochemical methods applied to qualitative and quantitative analyses of biopolymers and natural products is also briefly presented.",

Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the mechanisms of \"high-sugar resistance\". Sugars constitute the primary substrate providing energy and structural material for defense responses in plants, while they may also act as signal molecules interacting with the hormonal signaling network regulating the plant immune system. Sugars enhance oxidative burst at early stages of infection, increasing lignification of cell walls, stimulate the synthesis of flavonoids and induce certain PR proteins. Some sugars act as priming agents inducing higher plant resistance to pathogens.",

Drought stress caused reduction in total phenolic compounds in grapevine leaves and roots, where were identified tree phenolic acids: caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and ferulic acid. All acids found in leaves and roots occurred in the ester-bound form. Only caffeic acid in leaves appeared in the free and ester-bound form. Caffeic acid was present in the highest concentrations. The content of ferulic acid was the lowest in both tissues. The levels of all phenolic acids in leaves and roots decreased significantly under the drought stress. All the extracts from grapevine leaves and roots had antioxidative properties, but the antiradical activity of the extracts obtained from roots subjected to drought stress was lower to the control. The results of the analysis revealed that long-term drought stress caused a decrease in selected elements of secondary metabolism in such a different plant tissues that are the leaves and roots of the grapevine.",

Their main function is to carry out the photosynthesis process involving a conversion of light energy into the energy of chemical bonds used for the synthesis of organic compounds. The Chloroplasts’ proteome consists of several thousand proteins that, besides photosynthesis, participate in the biosynthesis of fatty acids, amino acids, hormones, vitamins, nucleotides and secondary metabolites. Most of the chloroplast proteins are nuclear-encoded. During the course of evolution, many genes of the ancestral chloroplasts have been transferred from the chloroplast genome into the cell nucleus. However, these proteins which are essential for the photosynthesis have been retained in the chloroplast genome. This review aims to provide a relatively comprehensive summary of the knowledge in the field of the chloroplast genome arrangement and the chloroplast genes expression process based on a widely used model in plant genetic research, namely Arabidopsis thaliana .",

    "abstract": "The boundary between beneficial and phytotoxic levels of selenium (Se) is narrow, and both induce alteration in plant growth and their physiology. In this study, the influence of two Se forms (selenite or selenate) with different concentrations (2–80 µM) on cucumber plants was investigated. The toxicity threshold for selenate and selenite was determined at the concentrations of 80 and 20 µM, respectively. In the Se-exposed plants, the growth-promoting effect was found at 6 µM of selenite and at 6–20 µM of selenate. The root activity considerably increased with increasing selenite concentrations suggesting the upregulation of mitochondrial dehydrogenases activity. Selenite treatment also impaired photosynthetic pigments accumulation and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters. Moreover, Se exerted a dual effect on lipid peroxidation in roots: at low concentrations it inhibited this process, whereas at high concentrations it enhanced the accumulation of harmful lipid peroxides. Under low Se concentrations (<10 µM), the accumulation of Se in shoots was similar in the presence of selenate and selenite. When Se concentration was >10 µM, the accumulation of Se in shoots was greater in selenate-exposed than selenite-exposed plants. However, in the roots the Se concentrations were always higher after selenite exposure comparing to selenate. The N level in plants was generally maintained constant, while the remaining macronutrients (especially K, P, and S) concentrations were significantly changed depending on the form and concentrations of Se. These results imply that an application of either selenate or selenite at concentrations <10 µM may be potentially used for biofortification of cucumber with Se and changes in plant macronutrient contents are not expected under these conditions.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the seedlings of two wheat cultivars were used: drought-resistant Chinese Spring (CS) and drought-susceptible (SQ1). Seedlings were subjected to osmotic stress in order to assess the differences in response to drought stress between resistant and susceptible genotype. The aim of the experiment was to evaluate the changes in physiological and biochemical characteristics and to establish the optimum osmotic stress level in which differences in drought resistance between the genotypes could be revealed. Plants were subjected to osmotic stress by supplementing the root medium with three concentrations of PEG 6000. Seedlings were grown for 21 days in control conditions and then the plants were subjected to osmotic stress for 7 days by supplementing the root medium with three concentrations of PEG 6000 (D1, D2, D3) applied in two steps: during the first 3 days of treatment −0.50, −0.75 and −1.00 and next −0.75, −1.25 and −1.5 MPa, respectively. Measurements of gas exchange parameters, chlorophyll content, height of seedlings, length of root, leaf and root water content, leaf osmotic potential, lipid peroxidation, and contents of soluble carbohydrates and proline were taken. The results highlighted statistically significant differences in most traits for treatment D2 and emphasized that these conditions were optimum for expressing differences in the responses to osmotic stress between SQ1 and CS wheat genotypes. The level of osmotic stress defined in this study as most suitable for differentiating drought resistance of wheat genotypes will be used in further research for genetic characterization of this trait in wheat through QTL analysis of mapping population of doubled haploid lines derived from CS and SQ1.",

    "abstract": "Aphid feeding induces various defense signaling mechanisms in plants. The recognition of feeding activities by plants occurs through the use of transmembrane pattern recognition receptors (PRRS) or, acting largely inside the cell, polymorphic nucleotide-binding leucine-rich-repeat (NB-LRR) protein products, encoded by most R genes. Activation may induce defensive reactions which are the result of highly coordinated sequential changes at the cellular level comprising, among other changes, the synthesis of signaling molecules. The ensuing plant responses are followed by the transmission of defense response signal cascades. Signals are mediated by bioactive endogenous molecules, i.e. phytohormones, such as jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), ethylene (ET), abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellic acid (GA) and free radicals such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nitric oxide (NO) which independently provide direct chemical resistance. Plant-induced defenses are also regulated by a network of inter-connecting signaling pathways, in which JA, SA, and ET play dominant roles. Both synergistic and inhibitory aspects of the cross-talk among these pathways have been reported. This paper presents molecular mechanisms of plant response to aphid feeding, the precise activation of various endogenous bioactive molecules signaling in the response of many plant species and their participation in the regulation of numerous defense genes, which lead to a specific metabolic effect. Selected important points in signal transduction pathways were also discussed in studies on plant response to aphid feeding.",

    "abstract": "Maize seedlings grown in a nutrient solution were treated with Cd (50, 100 µM) or Cu (50, 100 µM). Roots and separated leaf sections (from the youngest––basal, through the middle––mature, to the oldest––apical) were analysed. Shoot and root fresh weight, and root net growth rates were reduced significantly after Cu application in comparison to Cd. Copper (50, 100 µM) and cadmium (100 µM) decreased the sum of chlorophyll and total carotenoid pools mostly in mature and old leaf sections. The concentration of Cu and Cd increased in the old and mature leaf sections. Analysis of organic acids showed that both metals differently influenced the low-molecular-weight organic acids (LMWOAs) content in maize leaf sections. In mature sections, the excess Cu increased the succinate and tartrate contents, whereas in the young ones mainly the tartrate level was elevated. Cadmium elevated citrate accumulation in mature and old sections, compared to the control plants. Malate, the main LMWOA in maize leaves, increased only after addition of 100 µM of Cd (mature and old sections) or 50 µM of Cu (old sections). Analysis of LMWOAs in roots showed that the excess of Cd or Cu induced higher accumulation of tartrate and malate and, additionally, copper increased the citrate content.",

Henta) plants grown in saline soil. Under saline condition, mycorrhizal inoculation significantly increased growth responses, nutrient contents, acid and alkaline phosphatases, proline and total soluble protein of wheat plants compared to non-mycorrhizal ones. Those stimulations were related to the metabolic activity of the each mycorrhizal fungus. The localization of succinate dehydrogenase \"SDH\" (as a vital stain for the metabolically active fungus) in the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi was variable. In general, mycorrhizal shoot plant tissues had significantly higher concentrations of P, N, K and Mg but lower Na concentration than those of non-mycorrhizal plants. In saline soil, growth and nutrition of wheat plants showed a high degree of dependency on mycorrhizal fungi (especially G. mosseae). The use of the nitroblue tetrazolium chloride method as a vital stain for SDH activity showed that all the structures of mycorrhizal infections in the wheat plant estimated by the trypan blue staining (non-vital stain) were not metabolically active. Interestingly, the reduction in Na uptake along with associated increases in P, N and Mg absorption and high proline, phosphatase activities and chlorophyll content in the mycorrhizal plants could be important for salt alleviation in plants growing in saline soils.",

    "abstract": "Melatonin (MEL) was thought to be only a neurotransmitter found in vertebrates until its detection in other organisms including plants. Although the number of publications on MEL function in plants is expanding, the knowledge of this subject is still insufficient. Among many functions which MEL performs in plants, its role as an antioxidant and a growth promoter is most supported by experimental evidence. This compound is an independent plant growth regulator and it may mediate the activities of other plant growth regulators. Due to its antioxidant properties MEL may also stabilize cell redox status and protect tissues against reactive oxygen and nitrogen species which accumulated under stressful environment. Some researchers propose that MEL could be used to improve the phytoremediation efficiency of plants against different pollutants. In this paper we show that exogenous MEL applied into the seeds could be a good biostimulator improving not only seed germination, seedling/plant growth but also crop production especially under stress conditions. We also believe that this compound can increase food quality (the aspect of functional food) and may improve human health. Since MEL is inexpensive and safe for animals and humans its application as a biostimulator could be a good, feasible and cost-effective method useful in agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Ethylene, a gaseous plant hormone regulates essentially all physiological processes during the plant's life cycle. The practical implications of ethylene biosynthesis regulation for plant improvement have supported the continuous basic research on dissecting the structure of genes encoding ethylene biosynthetic enzymes, their differential expression patterns, and mechanisms underlying their transcriptional activity. ACC oxidase (ACO) is involved in the final step of ethylene production in plant tissues. In various plants several ACO isoforms have been isolated which are encoded by a multigenic family. There is a strong evidence that ACO gene expression is positively correlated to the ethylene production rates and its multiple isoforms are under development and environmental control. Thus, the regulation of ACO gene activity may act either as an additional or in several cases also as a main level for controlling ethylene biosynthesis in higher plants. This review summarizes in detail the knowledge about organization and gene structure, and transcriptional expression of ACO genes from different plant species. The perspectives of manipulating ACO gene as a method in biotechnological modification of ethylene synthesis are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Calcium ions (Ca 2+ ) are absorbed from the soil by the root cells before being distributed throughout the plant. The transport of Ca 2+ to aboveground parts relies on the movement of xylem, which is influenced by the transpiration rate of individual organs. The final distribution of Ca 2+ in tissues and cells depends on the effective function of channels and transporters that facilitate Ca 2+ movement through plasma and specific intracellular membranes. Local fluctuations in free Ca 2+ concentrations serve as a mechanism to elicit cellular responses, characterized by distinct calcium signatures, or to enable long-distance signaling in a cell-to-cell network. The specificity of individual Ca 2+ transport proteins is primarily determined through studies in plants with induced changes in the expression of these proteins. Concurrently, it is recognized that plant cells contain significant reserves of Ca 2+ both in the labile and in the permanently bound states, which influences various aspects such as biomechanical properties or the defensive capabilities of the cells. The diverse roles of Ca 2+ in plant cells highlight the importance of a thorough understanding of Ca 2+ metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Nanoparticle applications have recently become a popular method due to increase the tolerance levels of plants to environmental stresses. In this study, changes induced by exogenous application of green synthesized and commercially purchased zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) (100, 500, 1000 mg/L) to drought-stressed Capsicum annuum plants were studied through comprehensive morphologic, anatomic, physiological and biochemical analyzes. While drought decreased relative water content (RWC) and leaf water potential (LWP), it increased proline, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) content and antioxidant enzyme activities. Exogenous ZnO NPs increased RWC and LWP but they decreased TBARS and proline contents in drought-stressed plants. Furthermore, the data obtained in this study revealed that the response of the antioxidant enzyme varies depending on the concentration of the nanoparticles and the type of synthesis. However, green synthesized ZnO NPs applications (100 and 500 mg/L) were found to be much more effective in reducing the adverse effects of drought stress than those synthesized chemically. The results of this study indicated that although the response of Capsicum annuum plants to ZnO NPs applications varied according to the type and concentration under drought conditions, nanoparticle applications did not lead to a consistent stress response.",

    "abstract": "The comparative responses of ten spring wheat cultivars to water stress were investigated. Wheat plants were cultured under hydroponics conditions (Hoagland nutrient) to the stage of three-leaf seedlings. Then, the water medium was supplemented with PEG (drought) or NaCl (salinity) to obtain a water status equal to −1.5 MPa. After a 2-day treatment, the changes in the following parameters were determined: fresh and dry weight, macro- and microelement accumulation, membrane injury (electrolyte leakage, lipid peroxidation) and fatty acid content of the phospholipid fraction of plasmalemma (in comparison to plants not stressed, taken as a control). Generally, the plants were more significantly influenced by water stress stimulated by PEG than by NaCl treatment, as compared to the plants cultivated in the control media. The results of the decrease in water content in leaves and electrolyte leakage from cells corresponded well with the intensity of lipid peroxidation (determined by malondialdehyde—MDA-content) and were chosen for the selection of investigated genotypes for tolerance to both stresses. The more tolerant genotypes exhibited the opposite changes in phospholipid fatty acid unsaturation for two applied stresses i.e. NaCl treatment caused a decrease in unsaturation whereas in PEG-treated plants an increase in unsaturation was observed. These changes were reversed for less tolerant plants, i.e. NaCl treatment influenced an increase in fatty acid unsaturation whereas in PEG-treated plants a decrease in unsaturation was measured. The ratio of U/S (unsaturated to saturated fatty acids) correlated with the total amount of accumulated macroelements. The content of Mg, Ca and S in leaves of plants undergoing both stress factors (NaCl and PEG) dropped whereas the K and P content increased in leaves of wheat seedlings cultured on media containing NaCl only. For microelements, a decrease in the accumulation of these nutrients was detected in all investigated seedlings.

    "abstract": "Hairy roots of Dracocephalum moldavica L. were induced using Agrobacterium rhizogenes strain A4. Transformed roots were obtained from shoot explants with low transformation frequency of up to 3 %. The effects of different liquid media: Murashige and Skoog (MS), Gamborg et al. (B5) and Woody Plant (WP) with full- and half-strength (½MS, ½B5, ½WP), on biomass accumulation and rosmarinic acid (RA) content were investigated. The hairy roots were cultured in photoperiod (16 h light/8 h dark) and darkness. Biomass of D. moldavica hairy roots was the highest (7.23 g flask−1 of fresh weight and 0.89 g flask−1 of dry weight) in the cultures grown in WP medium under periodic light. Ultra performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed the highest RA content (78 mg g−1 dry wt) in roots cultured in ½B5 medium under photoperiod conditions. It was about tenfold higher compared to roots of field-grown mother plants. Antioxidant activities and total phenolic contents of methanolic extracts of D. moldavica hairy roots cultured in ½B5 and WP media under photoperiod and darkness and roots of field grown plants were compared. All extracts were investigated using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging and phosphomolybdenum reduction assays. Total phenolic contents were estimated by the Folin–Ciocalteu method. The methanolic extract of D. moldavica hairy roots grown in ½B5 medium under photoperiod possessed the strongest effects on reducing Mo and DPPH radical scavenging. The activities were significantly higher (p ≤ 0.05) than those of methanolic extract of roots of intact plants grown in the field. The most active methanolic extract of hairy roots was characterized by the highest level of rosmarinic acid and total content of phenolic compounds.",

    "abstract": "Drought is the most significant abiotic stress in agriculture; thus, this area of studies seems to be one of the most important challenges in plant biology. Data about gene expression under drought are crucial to study drought response mechanisms and to select the genes for a transgenic approach. Quantitative RT-PCR is a powerful method for gene expression analysis; however, obtaining proper data normalization requires internal reference genes with stable level of expression. In the present paper ten potential reference genes were examined in two developmental stages of barley for their expression stability during leaf growth and increasing drought level. The results indicated that leaf growth per se affects the expression of studied genes to the similar extent as the drought and showed that different genes were most stably expressed in the seedling and the heading stage. As a result, different sets of reference genes were selected for different applications. For instance, ADP-ribozylation factor 1 and ubiquitin encoding genes were most suitable to study drought-induced changes in gene expression at the seedling stage, whereas actin and GAPDH genes were useful during heading, and ADP-ribozylation factor 1 and HSP90 allowed for the comparison between these two stages. Our data proved the necessity for validation of commonly used reference genes. The results indicate that expression of ADP seems to be the least affected by all the factors studied in the present experiment. However, when the effect of only one factor among those investigated in this work will be studied, different genes should be considered to be used as the references due to the higher stability of their expression.",

    "abstract": "Higher plants evolved mechanisms of uptake, distribution and accumulation of trace metals essential for the proper functioning of the organism (e.g., copper, zinc). Non-essential metals (e.g., cadmium, arsenic, lead) can also enter plant cells using the routes dedicated to the essential ones, because of the shared similar chemical and physical properties. Generally, trace elements are very reactive, able to generate reactive oxygen species and to interact or bind various organic ligands composed of C, H, O, N, P or S. Thus, after entering to the cells, metals are transported and sequestered mainly in a complex form, bound with amino acids, organic acids, peptides or specific metal-binding ligands. Considering diverse properties (e.g., pH value, abundancy of ions, redox state) characterizing cells, tissues and phloem or xylem sap, plants use various ligands to form stable complexes in different conditions. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview on the role of low-molecular weight acids and peptides in trace metals translocation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Alfalfa ( Medicago sativa L.) plant growth decreases when cultivated under salinity or irrigated with salty water. Inoculation with plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) is a method for mitigating the harmful effects of salinity on plants growth. To investigate salt-tolerant PGPB with salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive alfalfa cultivar interactions under salinity, some physiological and agronomical aspects were investigated. The inoculated plants of alfalfa cultivars with Hartmannibacter. diazotrophicus and Pseudomonas sp. bacteria were compared with non-inoculated plants. Plants were grown in growth room and irrigated with tap water until 6–7 weeks, and then, salinity stress imposed by irrigating with tap water (control), 10 dS m −1 and 20 dS m −1 NaCl. Salinity reduced relative water content (RWC), membrane stability index (MSI), K + , photosynthesis rate (Pn) and stomatal conductance (gs), leaf number, height, and dry weight, and increased sodium in all cultivars. Inoculation of cultivars with both PGPB mitigated the negative effects of salinity on plants growth by increasing the root length and weight, nodule number, chlorophyll pigments, RWC, MSI, Pn, and gs. Chlorophyll pigments, plant height and leaf number, Na + , K + /Na + , and nodule number improved more pronounced through inoculating with Pseudomonas sp., whereas K + , carotenoids, and RWC improved more pronounced through H. diazotrophicus under salinity. The results showed inoculation with two bacteria improved growth performance in salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive cultivars under 10 dS m −1 , but at high salinity (20 dS m −1 ), inoculation was successful only in salt-tolerant alfalfa cultivars.",

In the present study, the toxic effects of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and silver ions were studied on callus cells of two varieties of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.): stress tolerant—Parabola; stress sensitive—Raweta. Stress induced by silver particles or ions (0, 20, 40, 60 ppm) was investigated using different parameters such as morphological characteristics, lipid peroxidation and mobilization of defense system which was determined by analyzing the activity of antioxidant enzymes, glutathione (GSH) and proline contents. Microscopic observations revealed deformation of cells after treatment by sol of higher silver concentrations. An increase in malondialdehyde content in both studied varieties was observed. Tested varieties showed an increased proline content in the silver-treated cells. There was no effect of silver on the superoxide dismutases activity, while the activity of catalase was significantly decreased. The changes in the activity of peroxidases in both varieties were opposite. The highest content of intracellular GSH was noticed at a concentration of 20 ppm of both AgNPs and silver ions. The presented results demonstrate a significant similarity of the effects caused by the studied stressors: silver nanoparticles and silver ions. The results characterized the mechanism of action of nanosilver on wheat callus: morphology disorder, damage to cell membranes, severe oxidative stress and in consequence intensification of production of non-enzymatic antioxidants.",

    "abstract": "Somatic embryogenesis (SE) in the tree fern Cyathea delgadii was first described in 2015 and since then has been used to exploration of this phenomenon in cryptogamic plants. To deepen the knowledge about the hormonal control of SE, stipe explants were cultured on media supplemented with hormone biosynthesis and transport inhibitors (HBTIs). In the presence of 30 µM 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA), or 40 µM fluridone or 125 µM salicylic acid (SA), somatic embryo production was totally inhibited. The quantitative analysis of the changes in endogenous hormone and sugar contents was conducted every 2 days within 10-day-long initial culture. The results showed that the concentrations of endogenous indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA), cytokinins (CKs) and soluble sugars were strongly modified either by TIBA and fluridone. Under their influence, the contents of cytokinins such as c-Z, c-ZR, t-Z, t-ZR, KinR were reduced to barely detectable levels. Treatment with SA results in the changes in endogenous IAA and sugar contents. It also modifies the IAA/CKs ratio; however, excluding the first 2 days of culture, the concentrations of ABA and cytokinins were kept on the control level. All HBTIs significantly increased the kinetin (Kin) content. Our work sheds new light on the relationships between the biosynthetic inhibitors and phytohormones and sugars in the process of early SE. It can be helpful to study the role of hormones in acquisition of embryogenic competence.",

    "abstract": "Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) make a large class of biodegradable biopolymers that are naturally synthesized by numerous microorganisms. These biopolymers could be an alternative to commonly used plastics based on petroleum. Production of PHAs in bioreactors using microorganisms is not widely applied due to its unprofitability. Using transgenic plants for this purpose may be cheaper and more environmental friendly because the biosynthesis of PHAs in plants is based only on water, mineral salts, CO2 and light. Additionally, plants are not capable of degrading PHAs as bacteria do, and extraction of PHAs from plant tissues is not always necessary. The main objective of this work is a review of possibilities of PHA biosynthesis in transgenic plants and presentation of general information on properties and potential application possibilities of these biopolymers. The possibility of syntheses and accumulation of PHA in several transgenic plants has been studied for some years. Many experiments were performed on model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, however, the research has also revealed a great potential of transgenic crop plants such as camelina (Camelina sativa), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) or sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) as a good sources of PHAs. The highest level of PHAs accumulation in plants was achieved in transgenic A. thaliana (up to 40% of the dry weight of the leaf), and among crop plants in C. sativa (up to 20% of the dry weight of the seed). Increasing knowledge on PHAs permits expansion of the possibilities of these biopolymers use even at a low level of their accumulation in plant tissues.",

To select for the most sensitive indicators of drought or salt stress, three independent pot experiments with diverse setups were analysed with 20–20 measured parameters. Parameters of plant growth, phenology and symbiotic interactions, visual stress symptoms, photosynthetic activity, nutrient composition and vitality were studied and the result matrices were evaluated with principal component analysis (PCA). Stress effects manifested in PC1 of two experiments and in PC2 of the third one. Traits assumed to be adequate for stress indication were characterized by high PC1 or PC2 loading values. Beside parameters of biomass production, growth and visible stress symptoms, less evident traits e.g. root electrical capacitance, membrane stability index in roots and leaves, relative water content of leaves and SPAD units were identified.",

    "abstract": "Crop performance and yield are the results of genotypic expression as modulated by continuous interaction with the environment. Among the environmental factors, water is one of the most important, which limits the crop production on a global basis. Water resources in the world are steadily diminishing, and in many areas, including Poland, more frequent periods of drought are observed. There are many problems that are specifically related to water scarcity: an extremely dynamic nature of plant water status, relationship to the severity of the effects of water, time stress during ontogeny of plants, and the interaction of water stress with other environmental variables. The paper presents a review of recent literature on the effect of the grasses to drought stress at the level of physiological processes and the possibility of yielding. A better understanding of how long-term growth and yield are affected by water stress should aid in improving irrigation efficiency and practices, in modifying plants for more efficient water use, and in developing effective dry-land agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Variation in root system architecture (RSA) and morphology are important for improving phosphorus use efficiency (PUE) in wheat. This work aims to analyze the root system architecture and morphology of wheat genotypes to explain their variation in PUE. Two genotypes differing in PUE, RAC875 (P efficient) and Wyalkatchem (P inefficient) were grown in a sandy soil amended with adequate basal nutrients and two P rates (10 and 30 mg P kg−1). RSA traits were measured by freely available software, GiA roots and DIRT, and root hair features were measured using a microscope with an attached camera and LAS v3.6 software. Under low P supply, RAC875 produced greater shoot dry matter (DM) at 24, 27 and 48 days after sowing (DAS), and at maturity, RAC875 also had a higher grain yield at maturity. Enhanced P efficiency (biomass and seed yield at inadequate P supply relative to adequate P supply) was observed more so in RAC875 at all harvest times. P supply affected most RSA traits, with low P leading to reductions in convex hull area (CHA), root surface area, root volume, total root length and root tip number. RAC875 produced significantly greater CHA than Wyalkatchem at low P supply while Wyalkatchem had significantly larger CHA than RAC875 when P was non-limiting. RAC875 also had greater root hair density (RHD) than Wyalkatchem at low P level, but no difference was observed at adequate P. When grown under low P supply, a greater CHA and RHD in RAC875 were likely to contribute to improved P uptake, resulting in its higher shoot biomass and grain yield.",

    "abstract": "Eryngium planum L. cell and organ cultures were maintained on Murashige and Skoog media (MS), supplemented with exogenous hormones of different types and various concentrations for high biomass growth. The callus and cell suspension cultures were treated with increased sucrose concentration and/or elicited by methyl jasmonate for the enhancement of selected phenolic acids accumulation. Three phenolic acids, rosmarinic acid (RA), chlorogenic acid (CGA) and caffeic acid (CA), were detected by HPLC-DAD in those cultures. The sum of their content in the dry material was found to be higher in the shoot culture (3.95 mg g−1), root culture (7.05 mg g−1), callus (6.20 mg g−1) and cell suspension (2.04 mg g−1) than in the leaves (1.87 mg g−1) and roots (0.76 mg g−1) of intact plants. The major compound of in vitro cultures was always rosmarinic acid. The content of RA could be increased approximately threefold (16.24 mg g−1) in the callus culture and approximately twofold (3.91 mg g−1) in the cell suspension culture by elicitation with 100 μM methyl jasmonate (MeJA). The higher concentration of sucrose (S) in the medium (5, 6 %) led to over a twofold increase of CGA content in the callus culture (2.54 mg g−1). The three mentioned phenolic acids have been found in E. planum undifferentiated and differentiated in vitro cultures for the first time.",

BXs are found in monocot plants and in a few species of dicots. Over 50 years of study have led to the characterization of the chromosomal locations and coding sequences of almost all the genes involved in BX biosynthesis in a number of cereal species: ZmBx1–ZmBx10a÷c in maize, TaBx1–TaBx5, TaGT and Taglu in wheat, ScBx1÷ScBx5, ScBx6-like, ScGT and Scglu in rye. So far, the ortholog of the maize Bx7 gene has not been identified in the other investigated species. This review aims to summarize the available data on the genetic basis of BXs biosynthesis in cereals.",

    "abstract": "Postharvest physiological deterioration (PPD) of cassava (Manihot esculenta) storage roots is a complex physiological and biochemical process which involve many regulatory networks linked with specific proteins modulation and signaling transduction pathways. However, it is poorly understood regarding biological regulation, and the interactions among protein groups and signals to determine PPD syndrome in cassava storage roots. This review sheds some light on the possible molecular mechanisms involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS), calcium signaling transduction, and programmed cell death (PCD) in cassava PPD syndrome. A model for predicting crosstalk among calcium signaling, ROS and PCD is suggested to fine-tune PPD syndrome. This would clues to cassava molecular breeding to alleviate the PPD effects on the shelf-life.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Abiotic stresses such as herbicides can affect plant growth and yield. Using herbicide-resistant plant growth-promoting bacteria is a new approach to mitigate these side effects. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of three native plant growth-promoting bacteria isolated from the Medicago sativa rhizosphere, including Serratia rubidaea (A) and Pseudomonas putida (B), Serratia sp. (C) plus Synorhizobium meliloti (R) and their combinations (AB, AC, BC, ABC, AR, BR, CR, ABR, ACR, BCR, and ABCR) on microbial population, plant biomass, antioxidant enzymes (CAT, APX, and GPX) activities, and hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde contents at the presence and absence of imazethapyr herbicide. The results indicated that herbicide application decreased plant biomass but increased microbial population, antioxidant enzymes activities, and the concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde of all inoculated and non-inoculated plants. Bacterial inoculation in most cases increased microbial population, plant biomass, and antioxidant activities. These increases were more evident under herbicide application. The highest increase in these attributes was achieved by AB, AR, and ABR inoculums in the presence and absence of the herbicide. The microbial population, plant biomass and antioxidant activities were decreased under BC, CR, BCR, and ABCR inoculations. It can be concluded that in addition to growth promotion, these bacteria increase resistance against herbicide stress by controlling free-radical induced oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation through antioxidant enzymes. These findings create new visions in biofertilizer preparation for reducing environmental stresses.",

    "abstract": "Embryonic dormancy is defined as a set of blocks imposed upon a process(es) cardinal for growth. In apple seeds, all these blocks are removed as a result of cold treatment (stratification), but some of them are also affected by light and/or hormonal treatments. This review summarizes published data related to the modes of action of above factors on the changes in the levels of endogenous hormones and some other plant growth regulators (e.g., hydrogen cyanide), and on certain enzymes involved in mobilization of seed reserves and catabolism of their hydrolysis products. Phytochrome and activities of acid lipase and a protease have been indicated as receptors of light and low temperature, respectively. Several chains of events initiated by these two environmental factors and leading to dormancy removal are proposed, and the sites of their control by hormones and HCN are indicated. These chains are postulated to contribute to the elimination of particular blocks that hinder germination and therefore to be involved in the mechanisms of dormancy breakage.",

    "abstract": "Responses of barley seedlings to water deficit (WD) induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000) and ultraviolet (UV-B; 280–320 nm) radiation and their interaction (UV-B + WD) were examined. A decrease in dry matter yield and water content of leaves and roots was observed following application of WD and UV-B + WD, while no changes were found after treating barley plants with UV-B. Proline content was increased in leaves under WD conditions and UV-B + WD. In contrast, UV-B treatment had no effect on the accumulation of proline in leaves of barley plants. Changes in root proline content showed a varied response: WD induced an increase in the level of this amino acid, while UV-B as well as UV-B + WD suppressed root proline content. The lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA) was increased in leaves under WD and UV-B + WD stresses. Root MDA content increased in WD-stressed plants, but it decreased in the case of combined application of both stresses. The applied stress factors operated in a variable manner on phenylpropanoid metabolism. Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) activity in leaves and roots was stimulated after exposure to WD and application of UV-B + WD stresses, while UV-B stress did not affect its activity. On the other hand, UV-B treatment enhanced the activity of 4:coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL) in leaves and this enhancement was positively correlated with the accumulation of anthocyanins and flavonols. However, the combined application of WD and UV-B reduced the positive effect of UV-B on the accumulation of these compounds and the activity of 4CL. Surprisingly, anthocyanins and flavonols were not detected in roots of examined barley seedlings despite increased 4CL activity. The results suggest that UV-B-induced activation of 4CL as well as accumulation of anthocyanin and flavonols in leaves is beneficial for the response to this stress factor. On the other hand, WD-induced reduction of the effect of UV-B on 4CL activity and the contents of anthocyanin and flavonol might be a cause of membrane damage in UV-B- and WD-stressed plants. In addition, conversely to what could be expected, the UV-B effect was perceived by the water-stressed roots, which exhibited reduced lipid peroxidation (MDA) and proline accumulation in WD-stressed plants exposed to UV-B.",

Every variety grown in greenhouse demonstrated higher light-saturated photosynthetic capacity than in the open field. The diurnal net photosynthesis (A) curve in the open field also displayed dual peaks with lower daily average A compared to the greenhouse. Varieties Alata and Pumila were found to acclimatize better under both growing conditions. The diurnal patterns of F v/F m indicated that plants grown under greenhouse encountered less photoinhibition than in open field condition. A decrease in chlorophyll (chl) a/b ratio in leaves of greenhouse plants with significant increase in chl b was observed. This study indicates that var. Alata and var.

Two days of water-logging caused about 40–50% decline in superoxide radical (O2 ·−) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) contents in all the genotypes, however, further water-logging to 8 days caused significant increase in O2 ·− and H2O2 contents, and the values were 80–90% of the control values. In control and revived plants O2 ·− and H2O2 contents were higher in Pusa Baisakhi, while under water-logging stress T 44 and V. luteola showed greater increases in the O2 ·− and H2O2 contents. Hypoxia induced increase in superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione reductase activities were higher in T 44 and V. luteola compared with Pusa Baisakhi; and the increases in T 44 and V. luteola continued up to 8th day of water-logging, while in case of Pusa Baisakhi, the maximum increase was observed only on the 2nd day of water-logging. Gene expression studies showed enhanced expression of cytosolic-Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) and cytosolic-ascorbate peroxidase (APX) in the roots of waterlogged V. luteola and T 44, while little expression was observed in control or treated plants of Pusa Baisakhi. PCR band products were cloned and sequenced, and partial cDNAs of Cu/Zn-SOD and APX, respectively, were obtained. Results suggest that increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes is to scavenge reactive oxygen species produced both during and after relief from water-logging stress.",

    "abstract": "Members of the aldo–keto reductase family including aldose reductases are involved in antioxidant defense by metabolizing a wide range of lipid peroxidation-derived cytotoxic compounds. Therefore, we produced transgenic wheat genotypes over-expressing the cDNA of alfalfa aldose reductase gene. These plants consequently exhibit 1.5–4.3 times higher detoxification activity for the aldehyde substrate. Permanent drought stress was generated in the greenhouse by growing wheat plants in soil with 20 % water capacity. The control and stressed plants were monitored by a semi automatic phenotyping platform providing computer-controlled watering, digital and thermal imaging. Calculation of biomass values was based on the correlation (R 2 = 0.7556) between fresh weight and green pixel-based shoot surface area. The green biomass production by plants of the three transgenic lines was 12–26–41 % higher than the non-transgenic plants' grown under water limitation. Thermal imaging of stressed non-transgenic plants indicated an elevation in the leaf temperature. The thermal status of transformants was similar at both normal and suboptimal water regime. In drought, the transgenic plants used more water during the growing season. The described phenotyping platform provided a comprehensive data set demonstrating the improved physiological condition of the drought stressed transgenic wheat plants in the vegetative growth phase. In soil with reduced water capacity two transgenic genotypes showed higher seed weight per plant than the control non-transgenic one. Limitation of greenhouse-based phenotyping in analysis of yield potential is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Environmental stresses (soil compaction, drought, waterlogging) cause changes in plants’ root system structure, also affecting the growth of above-ground parts. The aim of this study was to estimate phenotypic variation among maize and triticale genotypes in root penetration ability through petrolatum-wax-layer (RPA). Also, the effect of shortage or excess of soil water on dry matter of shoots and roots and morphological changes in root system structure in sensitive and resistant maize and triticale genotypes grown in low or high soil compaction level was evaluated. To estimate RPA index, the petrolatum-wax-layer method (PWL) was used. The strength of three petrolatum-wax concentrations 60, 50 and 40 % was 0.52, 1.07 and 1.58 MPa, respectively. High coefficients of variation (CV) were observed in 0.52 and 1.07 MPa and for maize were 19.2 and 21.7 %, and for triticale, 12.5 and 18.3 %, respectively. The data indicate that the use of PWL technique is an effective screening method, and makes it possible to divide the genotypes into resistant and sensitive groups. The second part of this study investigated a multistress effect of soil compaction combined with drought or waterlogging on root and shoot growth and morphological changes in root system structure of maize and triticale genotypes differing in susceptibility to environmental stresses. Seedlings were grown for 4 weeks in root-boxes under conditions of low (LSC 1.1 g cm−3) or severe (SSC 1.6 g cm−3) soil compaction. Drought or waterlogging stresses were applied for 2 weeks from 14th to 28th day. In comparison to LSC treatment, in SSC treatment the decrease in dry matter of shoots and roots was greater for sensitive genotypes of maize and triticale (Ancora, CHD-147). Soil drought or waterlogging caused greater decrease of dry matter of shoots and roots in seedlings grown in SSC in comparison to LSC. The root penetration index (RPI) was estimated as a ratio of root dry matter in 15–40 cm root-box layer to total root dry matter. On the basis of RPI it was possible to group the genotypes according to their ability to distribute roots in soil profile. In comparison to LSC, SSC exerted a strong influence on the length of seminal and seminal adventitious roots, as well as the number and length of L- and S-type lateral roots developed on seminal and nodal roots. In both species the restriction effect of soil compaction on number and length of roots was more severe in sensitive (Ankora, CHD-147) than in resistant (Tina, CHD-247) genotypes. The restriction in roots propagation was greater in triticale than in maize. Exposure to drought or waterlogging in the case of genotypes grown in LSC and SSC treatments caused a decrease in number and length of particular components of root system structure. In both species the decrease of root number and length in plants grown under waterlogging was greater than under drought. The observed changes in root system were greater in sensitive (Ankora, CHD147) than in resistant (Tina, CHD-247) genotypes. Statistically significant correlations were found between RPA and RPI and also between these indexes and soil compaction, drought and waterlogging susceptibility indexes. This indicates that genotypes resistant to soil compaction were resistant to drought or waterlogging and also that genotypes resistant to drought were resistant to waterlogging.",

Shoot multiplication was performed in glass tubes and in a nutrient sprinkle bioreactor. A mixture of 0.1 mg L−1 indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and 1.0 mg L−1 of 6-benzylaminopurine in Murashige and Skoog (MS) agar-solidified medium proved the best combination for multiple shoot induction, yielding 8.2 shoots per explant after 4 weeks of culture in glass tubes. The number of shoots increased to 21 per explant when the same combination of growth regulators was used in a nutrient sprinkle bioreactor. The shoots rooted with a frequency of 93 % after 6 weeks of culture on MS agar medium supplemented with IAA (0.1 mg L−1) before being acclimatized in the greenhouse. The antioxidant activities of methanolic extracts from the leaves and roots of the in vitro-regenerated plants of R. glutinosa cultivated in the greenhouse were evaluated using four in vitro assays: scavenging of free radicals (DPPH and ABTS), transition metal reduction and total antioxidant activity phosphomolybdenum test. In all cases, the methanolic extract from leaves demonstrated better antioxidant activity than those taken from roots. A strong correlation was found between total phenolic and flavonoid content, and the antioxidant capacity of the studied extracts.",

The research was conducted under hydroponic conditions. The experimental design comprised ten objects differing with nickel concentrations in the solution (ranging from 0.0 to 10.0 mg Ni dm−3 of the nutrient solution). The parameters, assumed as the basis on which nickel bioretention by selected plant species was determined were: the yield, nickel content in various plant parts, uptake and utilization of this element by the plant, tolerance index (TI) and translocation factor (TF), the metal concentrations in the aboveground parts index (CI) and bioacummulation factor (BAF). On the basis of the obtained results it was found that, due to low tolerance of nickel, maize could be used as the indicator plant for the environment quality assessment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The current research was carried out to evaluate the stress tolerance potential of durum wheat plants, in response to the inoculation of native plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB), through assessing PSII photochemistry and photosynthetic traits, as well as grain yield and plant height, and to investigate the possibility of using PGPB as a sustainable alternative or in combination with traditional fertilization plans. A greenhouse experiment included chemical/microbiological fertilization and stress (salinity and drought) treatments. The results indicated that the application of bacterial consortium of four PGPB markedly augmented some biochemical and functional traits in photosystem II, such as effective quantum yield of PSII photochemistry (Y(II)), electron transport rate of PSII (ETR), photosynthesis capacity, transpiration rate and stomatal conductance in unstressed plants, and prevented severe changes in the mentioned traits under drought and salinity conditions. The application of PGPB contributed to enhanced grain yield, too. Furthermore, a better performance of the PGPB inoculation was found in combination with half-dose of the recommended chemical fertilizers. In conclusion, PGPB inoculants maintain or improve the photosynthesis efficiency of durum wheat, grain yield and plant height, particularly under stress conditions, and can help to minimize the consumption of chemical fertilizers.",

    "abstract": "Three varieties of oil palm seedlings (Deli Yangambi, Deli Urt, Deli AVROS) were exposed to three levels of CO2 (400, 800, 1,200 μmol/mol) in split plot design to determine growth (net assimilation rate, NAR; relative growth rate, RGR) and photosynthetic patterns of the seedlings under short-term CO2 exposure of 15 weeks. Increasing CO2 from 400 to 800 and 1,200 μmol/mol significantly enhanced total biomass and leaf area, net photosynthesis (A) and water use efficiency (WUE) especially from weeks 9 to 15. By the end of week 15, total biomass increased by 113%, and A and WUE by one- and fivefold, respectively, while specific leaf area decreased by 37%. Both enhanced biomass and A under elevated CO2 were effective in modifying NAR and RGR as shown by high correlation coefficient values (r 2 = 0.68 and 0.72; r 2 = 0.63 and 0.67, respectively), although WUE seemed to have more influence over the NAR (r 2 = 0.97) and RGR (r 2 = 0.93). Neither interspecific preference nor its interaction with CO2 imposed any significant effect on parameters observed. Growth improvement with CO2 seemed able to produce healthy, bigger and vigorous oil palm seedlings, and the technique may have potential to be developed for use to reduce nursery period.",

We demonstrated that enhanced NO emission by apple embryos during early phase of germination \"sensu stricto\" is required for seed transition from dormant into non-dormant state, and may be described by the model of \"nitrosative door\", analogous to \"oxidative window\". Cellular ROS concentration, resulting from NO or HCN embryo pre-treatment, seems to be under severe control of antioxidant system. Activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and total peroxidases (Prxs) was determined during NO and HCN-mediated germination \"sensu stricto\" of embryos. CAT and SOD activity increased transiently 24 h after embryos pre-treatment, while GR and Prx activity was stimulated mainly after 96 h. The most evident alterations were detected in GPX activity, being more than threefold stimulated by NO or HCN. Based on this results, we conclude that these reactive molecules act simultaneously crossing their signaling pathways and we propose that ROS, reactive nitrogen species, HCN at accurate level are essential during seed germination as signaling factors.",

The level of secondary metabolites was found to be strongly affected by the age and type of plant organ. A comparative analysis of S. altissima plants propagated in vitro and from seeds revealed no differences in the level of secondary metabolites when plants of the same age were studied. The antioxidant potential of methanolic extracts from shoot cultures, and the shoots and roots of S. altissima plants propagated in vitro, were evaluated using ABTS radical scavenging, FRAP metal reduction power and the lipid peroxidation test, in relation to the content of baicalin, wogonoside, verbascoside, total phenolic and total flavonoid compounds. Extracts from the roots of field-grown regenerated plants at the flowering stage were found to possess the strongest antioxidant activity. Correlation analysis revealed that the antioxidant activity of extracts correlated most closely with their total phenolic content estimated by the Folin-Ciocalteu method.",

The procedure led to the isolation of a substantial amount of 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (3,5-DCQA)—a potent free radical scavenger. An analytical RP-HPLC separation of the hydroalcoholic extract from the hairy roots allowed identification of further hydroxycinnamates: caftaric acid (CTA), chlorogenic acid (5-CQA) and cichoric acid (DCTA), as well as small amounts of unbound phenolic acids. A time course of growth and caffeic acid derivatives accumulation in the hairy root culture was also investigated. The highest contents of the compounds in the examined roots were detected at the logarithmic phase of growth. The average content of 3,5-DCQA in the roots (ca. 2.5% DW) was at least one order of magnitude higher than that found in roots of Lactuca species and callus culture of L. virosa.",

In this study the effects of drought stress on the growth and selected physiological traits were examined in the seedlings of 13 single cross maize (C4 plant) hybrids and 11 spring triticale (C3 plant) breeding lines and varieties differing in drought sensitivity. For plants in the seedling stage the results demonstrated a genetic variation in dry matter accumulation of shoots and roots (DWS, DWR), number (N) and length (L) of particular components (seminal, seminal adventitious, nodal) of the root system, membrane injury by soil drought (LID), osmotic and high temperature stress (LIOS, LIHT), water potential (ψ), water loss (WL), grain germination in osmotic stress (FG, PI), and seedling survival (SS). Seedlings grown under moderate soil drought showed a decrease in dry matter of the top parts and roots and a decrease in the length of seminal, seminal adventitious and nodal roots in comparison to seedlings grown in control conditions. The observed harmful effects of drought stress were more distinct in drought sensitive genotypes. Used in this paper drought susceptibility indexes (DSIGY) were calculated in other experiment by determining the changes in grain yield (GY) under two soil moisture levels (irrigated and drought). The variation of DSIGY for maize ranges from 0.381 to 0.650 and for triticale from 0.354 to 0.578. The correlations between DSIGY and laboratory tests (LI, FG, SS) confirmed that they are good indicators of drought tolerance in plants. The highest values of genetic variation were observed in LI, DWS, SS and WL and the lowest in the measurements of ψ FG, PI, LS, LSA and LN. The correlation coefficients between LIOS and LIHT tests were, in most of the considered cases, statistically significant, which indicates that in maize and triticale the mechanisms of membrane injury caused by simulated drought or high temperature are physiologically similar. It can be concluded that an approach to the breeding of maize and triticale for drought tolerance using these tests can be implemented on the basis of separate selection for each trait or for all of them simultaneously. In that case, it would be necessary to determine the importance of the trait in relation to growth phase, drought timing and level, as well as its associations with morphological traits contributing to drought tolerance. The obtained values of the correlation coefficient between laboratory tests suggest that the same physiological traits may be applied as selection criteria in drought tolerance of maize and triticale genotypes.",

    "abstract": "The main storage compound in lupin seeds is protein, whose content can reach up to 45–50 % of dry matter. However, seeds of some lupin species can also contain quite a large amount of storage lipid. The range of lipid content in lupin seeds is from about 6 to about 20 % of dry matter. Storage lipid in developing seeds is synthesized mainly from sugars delivered by mother plants. During seed germination, one of the main end-products of storage lipid breakdown is also sugars. Thus, the sugar level in tissues is considered an important regulatory agent, during both lipid accumulation and lipid breakdown. Generally, in developing legume seeds, there is a strong negative relation between accumulation of storage protein and storage lipid. Results obtained in developing lupin cotyledons cultured in vitro pointed to the possibility of a positive relation between protein and lipid accumulation. Such a positive effect could be caused by nitrate. During lupin seed germination and seedling development, the utilization of storage lipid is enhanced under sugar deficiency conditions in tissues and is controlled at the gene expression level. However, under sugar starvation conditions, autophagy is significantly enhanced, and it can cause disturbances in storage lipid breakdown. The hypothesis of pexophagy, i.e., autophagic degradation of peroxisomes under sugar starvation conditions during lupin seed germination, has been taken into consideration. The flow of lipid-derived carbon skeletons to amino acids was discovered in germinating lupin seeds, and this process is clearly more intense in sucrose-fed embryo axes. At least four alternative or mutually complementary pathways of carbon flow from storage lipid to amino acids in germinating lupin seeds are postulated. The different strategies of storage compound breakdown during lupin seed germination are also discussed.",

The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of various Zn application levels on some physiological, morphological and biochemical parameters of a hybrid Salix purpurea × triandra × viminalis 2. Plants were cultivated under control conditions with application of Zn in the range 0–5 mM. The effects on net photosynthesis rate (P N), stomatal conductance (g s), transpiration rate (E), intercellular CO2 (C i), chlorophyll a and b, carotenoids, growth, sugars and phenols were analysed. Our investigations confirmed a dual role of Zn, with benefits at the level 1–2.5 mM, and a decrease of measured photosynthesis activity, carbohydrates and chlorophyll below and above this range. Moreover, the decrease of these parameters at the highest Zn application did not reach the level of control plants. This means that this species may have further potential as an accumulator in polluted areas. However, phenols revealed a continuous increase together with Zn increase in the medium.",

Korona plants were inoculated with the bacteria Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola (Psp), necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea (Bc) or with both pathogens sequentially. The aim of the experiment was to determine how plants cope with multiple infection with pathogens having different attack strategy. Possible suppression of the non-specific infection with the necrotrophic fungus Bc by earlier Psp inoculation was examined. Concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide anion (O2 −) and H2O2 and activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) were determined 6, 12, 24 and 48 h after inoculation. The measurements were done for ROS cytosolic fraction and enzymatic cytosolic or apoplastic fraction. Infection with Psp caused significant increase in ROS levels since the beginning of experiment. Activity of the apoplastic enzymes also increased remarkably at the beginning of experiment in contrast to the cytosolic ones. Cytosolic SOD and guaiacol peroxidase (GPOD) activities achieved the maximum values 48 h after treatment. Additional forms of the examined enzymes after specific Psp infection were identified; however, they were not present after single Bc inoculation. Subsequent Bc infection resulted only in changes of H2O2 and SOD that occurred to be especially important during plant–pathogen interaction. Cultivar Korona of common bean is considered to be resistant to Psp and mobilises its system upon infection with these bacteria. We put forward a hypothesis that the extent of defence reaction was so great that subsequent infection did not trigger significant additional response.",

    "abstract": "In field conditions plants undergo combinations of stresses like soil compaction combined with soil drought or flooding. In maize there exists an intraspecific variation in responses to environmental stresses, e.g. drought, flooding and soil compaction. In this study seedlings of two maize hybrids (sensitive and resistant to soil compaction) were grown under low, moderate and high soil compaction levels and drought or flooding. Water potential, electrolyte leakage, chlorophyll a content, gas exchange, ABA and antioxidant activity were measured. In seedlings exposed to different soil compaction levels differences between soil, leaf and root water potentials were observed at noon and later in the day. Significant differences between hybrids grown in low and severe soil compactions and exposed to drought or flooding were noticed in membrane injury, leaf water potential, chlorophyll a content and gas exchange parameters. Statistically significant differences between hybrids were observed in ABA content in the stem under severe and in the root under low soil compaction and exposed to drought and flooding, and in antioxidant activity in leaf under severe soil compaction and under low soil compaction with drought or flooding stresses. Further studies on physiological responses of genotypes contrasting in tolerance to different stresses would help us explore stress tolerance mechanisms.",

There are also plants, the seeds of which can respond only to smoke, but not to KAR1, and vice versa. Smoke and/or KAR1 can be applied in horticulture, agriculture, and revegetation. This review describes effects of smoke and KAR1 on weed seed germination and focuses mainly on the recent knowledge about the physiological role of these factors in dormancy release and germination of Avena fatua caryopses. The involvement of gibberellins, ethylene, and abscisic acid (ABA) in the response to smoke or KAR1 is discussed. Effects of smoke or KAR1 on the contents of reactive oxygen species (ROS), non-enzymatic antioxidants, and activity of the enzymes participating in ROS removal are presented. Cell cycle activity in the response to SW and KAR1 is also considered. Effects of KAR1 on thermodormancy release in A. fatua caryopses are highlighted, as well.",

    "abstract": "Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) has a great potential for plant biostimulation. Its role in plant physiology is intensively explored, and its important function in plant stress defence frequently underlined. Melatonin is particularly effective when applied as an additional factor of seed priming. In the presented research, hydroconditioning was chosen experimentally as optimal for maize (Zea mays L.) seeds. The following seed variants were compared: controlled non-treated, hydroprimed with water and hydroprimed with melatonin solutions 50 and 500 μM. To identify modifications in proteome of maize seeds caused by the applied hydroconditioning techniques, protein extracts of germinated seed embryos (24 h, 25 °C) were separated by 2D-PAGE. Next, obtained maps of proteomes were compared (statistically and graphically) using PDQuest software, and characteristic spots of proteins were analysed qualitatively by mass-spectrometric techniques and identified in the Mascot protein databases. Research helped to identify hydropriming-associated proteins, and for the first time those which were expressed only in the presence of melatonin. Study confirmed that suitably selected pre-sowing treatment with melatonin, by embryo proteome modification, effectively prepares plants to adverse environmental conditions. In melatonin treated seeds during the initial state of embryos growth, even under optimal conditions, additional antioxidative, detoxifying, anti-stresses proteins were synthesized. Moreover, the supply of energy from seed storage substances was pretty intensified. The presented results partially explain how melatonin acts in plant stress defence, and why plants with higher melatonin content have exhibited increased capacity for stress tolerance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Silicon, a quasi-essential element that is often associated with rigidity and hardiness is an alleviator of biotic and abiotic stresses. Lodging affects the ability of plants especially cereal plants such as rice, Oryza sativa to grow upright, thus reducing yield and increasing harvesting costs. Bending or lodging resistance could be increased by strengthening the rice culm. Here, we tested stage and method of silicon application, each with three levels of treatments to find the right combination to enhance yield and lodging resistance in MR219, a popular rice variety in Malaysia. Application of silicon at the onset of reproductive stage via topdressing improved agronomic and physiological parameters. Plants applied with Si at the reproductive stage by means of topdressing showed a significantly higher leaf area. Number of tillers, weight per panicle and weight of 100 grains were significantly higher when silicon was applied as topdressing at the reproductive stage. Number of spikelets per panicle was significantly higher when silicon was supplied as topdressing or soil incorporation. Percentage of filled spikelets was significantly higher when silicon supplementation was done as topdressing at either reproductive or maturity stages. Mode of application which favoured the increase in soluble lignin and neutral detergent fiber was topdressing and soil incorporation. Meanwhile, cellulose and acid detergent lignin was highest when silicon was applied at the reproductive and maturity stages. Application of silicon at the reproductive stage by means of topdressing was effective in improving growth, yield and stem strength of the rice plant since the method has higher retention time and has residual effect. Foliar application was deemed unsuitable as it can only be applied in minimal amount while showing a temporary effect.",

However, there is little known about the underlying mechanism of their combination treatments' mediating effect on salt stress tolerance. In this investigation, the potential impact of 100 mg L −1 SA and/or 30 mg L −1 SPM in avoiding salt damage at saline environments of 6.0 and 12.0 dS m –1 in wheat was examined. Results showed that by increasing mineral acquisition, chlorophyll a and b contents, antioxidant enzymes activity, osmolytes accumulation, leaf water content, grains carbohydrate and protein content as well as reducing Na + accumulation, membrane electrolyte leakage, malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide contents, exogenously applied SA and/or SPM significantly reduced the detrimental impacts of soil salinization and increased wheat growth and productivity. The best outcomes came from combining the SA and SPM treatments. Overall, this combined treatment enhanced mineral homeostasis, osmolytes accumulation, and antioxidant response, pointing to a potential role for it in minimizing the negative consequences of salt stress. Therefore, combining SA and SPM in a sustainable agricultural system can be viewed as a successful technique for reducing salt damage.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Salt stress is a worldwide major threat to agricultural production. The aim was to investigate the effects of exogenous dopamine (DA) treatments on physiological, morphological and biochemical characteristics of tomato seedlings under salinity stress. Salt stress was created using a 100 mM NaCl solution. Dopamine solutions (0, 50, 100 and 200 µM) were applied with 7-day intervals. Salt stress significantly suppressed plant growth and DA treatments alleviated the negative effects of salt stress on the growth of tomato seedlings. 100 µM DA treatment increased plant and root dry weights, plant stem diameter, plant height and, leaf area by 286.84%, 150.00%, 108.37%, 160.89%, and 158.28%, respectively, compared to the control. Under salinity LRWC, SPAD, chl-a, chl-b, and total chlorophyll contents decreased; membrane permeability (MP), H 2 O 2 , MDA, proline and sucrose contents, CAT, POD and SOD activities increased. Under salt stress, when 100 µM DA was applied, LRWC, SPAD, chl-a, chl-b, and total chlorophyll contents of plants increased by 13.64%, 18.62%, 43.08%, 64.90%, and 50.00%, while MP reduced by 21.08% compared to the control. When 200 µM DA was applied under salt stress, H 2 O 2 , MDA, proline and sucrose contents, and CAT, POD and SOD activities were reduced by 31.86%, 18.66%, 56.00%, 38.24%, 11.16%, 17.81% and 10.80%, respectively, compared to non-DA-treated plants. Exogenous application of DA increased IAA content, decreased ABA content and increased ratio of K + /Na + and Ca 2+ /Na + under salt stress as well. In conclusion, exogenous dopamine treatments effectively prevent cellular damage in tomato seedlings and improve plant tolerance to salt stress.",

    "abstract": "We have successfully established the co-culture of ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer) and echinacea [Echiancea purpurea (L.) Moench.] adventitious roots for the production secondary metabolites. Adventitious roots of ginseng and echinacea were cultured in different proportions (5 g L−1; 4:1, 3:2 and 2:1 ginseng and echinacea, respectively) in 5-L capacity airlift bioreactors containing 4 L Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 25 μM indole-3-butyric acid and 50 g sucrose L−1 and maintained at 25°C in the dark for 40 days. Results showed the negative effect of echinacea adventitious roots on the growth of ginseng roots, however, by limiting the inoculum density of echinacea, it was possible to establish the co-cultures. To enhance the accumulation of secondary metabolites, co-cultures were treated with 200 μM methyl jasmonate after 30 days of culture initiation. Methyl jasmonate elicitation promoted the accumulation of ginsenosides in the co-cultures. It was possible to produce ginsenosides and caffeic acid derivatives in higher amounts by establishing co-cultures with higher inoculum proportion of ginseng to echinacea (4:1 and 3:2) followed by elicitation treatment. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of interspecies adventitious root co-cultures for the production of plant secondary metabolites.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the effects of β-amino-butyric acid (BABA) on root-knot nematode(Meloidogyne javanica) infection of cucumber and accumulation of total phenolic compounds, hydrogen peroxide and activity of some enzymes related to plant defense mechanisms, i.e., guaiacol peroxidase (GPOX), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), catalase (CAT) in cucumber roots infected with nematode were investigated. Results of this study show that treating the cucumber seedlings with the above elicitor significantly reduces the nematode infection level (the nematode galls, number of egg masses per plant and number of eggs per individual egg mass) compared to control. Additionally, treatment of cucumber roots by BABA and BABA + nematode, significantly increased peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase and catalase activities in root tissues, 1 day after nematode inoculation in comparison to nematode inoculated plants as control and sterile water-treated plants. Enzyme activities reached to a maximum level at 4, 4 and 3 days after nematode inoculation, respectively. Additionally, the amount of H2O2, a product of oxidative stress, was significantly increased in the BABA and BABA + nematode treatments in comparison to control. Such increases have occurred in two phases and maximum levels of it were observed at 5 days after inoculation. Inoculation of cucumber plants by BABA also significantly increased accumulation of total phenol in comparison to control and maximum level of it was observed at 7 days after nematode inoculation. The results suggest that the inhibitory effect of BABA on the root-knot nematode (M. javanica) may be related to its ability to enhance defense responses in the cucumber roots.",

Control plants were grown in soil without the addition of NaCl and treated plants were grown in soil with 50 mM of NaCl for 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks. In parenchyma cells from Populus tremula × tremuloides petioles with an increased level of NaCl in the soil: (a) turgor pressure was reduced after 1 week of treatment but afterward it was similar to untreated plants, (b) the value of elastic modulus of the cell walls increased, and (c) hydraulic conductivity of the plasma membrane of treated plants decreased in comparison to untreated ones. No histological differences and distribution of JIM5 antibody between the petioles of plants grown under salinity and the untreated were found. In cell walls of parenchyma and collenchyma from plants grown under salinity, the presence of pectic epitopes recognized by JIM7 antibodies was increased in comparison to the control plants. The obtained results indicate that under salt stress the permeability of water through plasma membrane is disturbed, cell walls became more rigid but the turgor pressure did not change.",

    "abstract": "Carbon assimilated during photosynthesis is allocated to basic needs, such as growth, defense, and storage of nutrients. The aim of this study was to explore potential relationships between carbon allocation and light conditions during growth, including shade tolerance of species. We studied species that represent light-demanding (Sorbus aucuparia, Betula pendula), intermediate (Carpinus betulus, Quercus robur), and shade-tolerant (Acer platanoides, Fagus sylvatica) trees. We exposed seedlings to two light treatments (full sunlight and shade), and explored how these conditions affect plant growth and biomass allocation, as well as the levels of phenolic compounds, nonstructural carbohydrates, carbon, and nitrogen. We hypothesized that light-demanding species invest less carbon in chemical defenses against pathogens and/or herbivores compared to shade-tolerant species. On the other hand, light-demanding species showed the greater part of assimilated carbon allocate to growth processes. As a result, the stem diameter above the root collar, the mass of leaves, stems, coarse, and fine roots were larger under full-sunlight conditions in all species, except for greater height of A. platanoides and Q. robur under shade conditions. Leaves from full light were characterized by lower nitrogen content, higher carbon and phenolic contents, and a higher carbon/nitrogen ratio compared with leaves from seedlings grown in shade. In the case of shade-tolerant species, a trade-off mechanism can be proposed that such species restrict their usual allocation of carbon to defense and radial growth, while instead of investing it in increasing their heights and storage capacities. According to the light-demanding species, it was not possible to identify a trade-off mechanism and how carbon allocation is restricted upon exposure to shade conditions, except for the reduced allocation to the root mass.",

The shoots were grown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) agar medium with 1 µM indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and different content of 6-benzyloaminopurine (BAP), zeatin, kinetin (1, 2, 4, 8, 18 µM) or thidiazuron (TDZ) (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 µM). The highest multiplication rate (about seven shoots and/or buds per explant) was obtained after 4 weeks of culture on MS medium with 1 µM IAA and 8 or 16 µM BAP. Optimal biomass of plant material was also received on the same media. The identity of the compounds present in the hydromethanolic extracts from D. forrestii shoots grown on cytokinin-supplemented media was confirmed using UPLC–PDA–ESI–MS method. The analysis revealed the presence of nine metabolites recognized as caffeic acid derivatives. The content of the predominant phenolic acids in the extracts, i.e. rosmarinic acid (RA) and salvianolic acid B (SAB), was determined with UHPLC. The highest yield of RA was found in shoots cultivated in the medium containing 1 µM IAA and 2 µM BAP (18.7 mg/g DW). The highest level of SAB (5.3–5.9 mg/g DW) was identified in multiple shoots grown in the presence of 1 µM IAA and 0.5–1 µM TDZ or 2 µM BAP.",

    "abstract": "Plants have developed different strategies to adapt to various stress conditions including drought. In the present study the drought-induced changes in the actin filament (AFs) network was studied, for the first time, in two barley cultivars of contrasting drought tolerance level. Detached leaves of drought-tolerant (cv. 'CAM/B1/CI') and drought-susceptible (cv. 'Maresi') cultivars were dried under controlled conditions. The water relations as well as the transcript accumulation of actin (ACT11), actin depolymerization factor (ADF1) and dehydrine (HVA1) encoding genes were studied using qRT-PCR. Quantitative (the relative fluorescence index; RFI) and qualitative drought-induced changes in AF cytoskeleton were observed following staining with phalloidin. It was noticed that tolerant cultivar was characterized with relative water content decreased during drought treatment which was accompanied by increase in HVA1 expression together with decrease in ACT11 and ADF1 transcripts accumulation induced by drought. In drought-susceptible cultivar the expressions of both ACT11 and ADF1 were slightly lower than those in the control. Drought triggered an extensive AF cytoskeleton reorganization within different types of leaf-blade cells. Remarkable changes in AF configuration and its increased amount (fluorescence intensity) were observed mainly in drought-tolerant cultivar. In addition, drought-induced changes in AFs were closely associated with chloroplasts. Those AFs probably controlled drought-induced intracellular chloroplast positioning in mesophyll. Based on the results obtained in the present study, the possible role of AF rearrangements in drought response is discussed.",

The subcellular distribution of ascorbate, glutathione, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy and correlated with the activity of antioxidative enzymes in wildtype plants and the ascorbate- and glutathione-deficient mutants vtc2-1 and pad2-1, respectively. Both mutants showed earlier and stronger senescence than the wildtype indicating the importance of a functioning ascorbate and glutathione cycle in the induction and regulation of senescence. Glutathione levels dropped drastically and up to 93 % in all cell compartments of wildtype plants and the vtc2-1 mutant within the first day of dark-induced senescence while ascorbate contents remained unchanged until the very end. Glutathione contents in mitochondria of pad2-1 mutants decreased more slowly over the first 7 days than compared to the other plants indicating an important role of glutathione in mitochondria in this mutant during senescence. The strongest decrease (84 %) of glutathione contents in wildtype plants at this time point was found in mitochondria indicating an important role of mitochondria for the induction of senescence and cell death events. Due to the general decrease of the antioxidative capacity, a strong accumulation of H2O2 was observed in cell walls, plastids, and the cytosol in all plants. Activities of glutathione reductase, dehydroascorbate reductase and catalase were strongly reduced while ascorbate peroxidase and monodehydroascorbate reductase were increased. The initial rapid drop of glutathione levels seemed to be the trigger for senescence, while ascorbate appeared to be the key factor in regulating senescence through controlling H2O2 levels by the oxidation of reduced ascorbate to monodehydroascorbate and the subsequent reduction to ascorbate by monodehydroascorbate reductase.",

This report demonstrates nitrogen source impact on growth, saponin accumulation, and secretion in hairy root and suspension cultures of marigold. Hairy roots preferred nitrate as a mineral source of nitrogen, but its impact on growth, OA glycosides accumulation, and secretion were line-dependent. The best productivity of OA glycosides was found in CC16 line (74.86 mg flask−1) in ½ MS medium modified by 2.5× KNO3 and ammonium elimination with 2.5 g l−1 peptone. Organic nitrogen source at 27.5-g l−1 impairs the growth rate of hairy roots. Its effect on saponin accumulation and secretion to the surrounding medium depended on line and media composition. Nitrate:ammonium ratio of 4:2 for CC16 resulted in 5.7-fold increment of saponin secretion comparing to the standard medium. Embryo roots, apical bud, and hypocotyls explants were crucial for induction of suspension culture synthesizing saponins; however, effect of mineral form of nitrogen in cultivating medium had to be considered. The highest OA glycosides level (171.97 μg g−1 of dry weight) was recorded in the root derived culture with nitrate as a sole mineral form of nitrogen. Peptone from lactalbumin decidedly inhibited the saponin formation; however, it was essential for culture initiation, proliferation, and organ differentiation.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate whether ABA, sucrose or Phytagel applied to the maturation medium at different concentrations affected the growth, development and starch content of somatic embryos of Picea abies and Picea omorika. Embryogenic tissues of both spruce species were placed on maturation medium supplemented with various doses of ABA (10, 20, 40 and 80 µM), sucrose (17, 34 and 68 g/L) or Phytagel (4, 6 and 8 g/L). Our results showed that ABA and the osmoticum had a significant effect on the production and maturation of somatic embryos of both spruce species. Supplementing the medium with low concentrations of ABA (10 µM) or sucrose (17 g/L) resulted in the precocious germination of embryos. Adding sucrose to the maturation medium at the highest tested concentration (68 g/L) improved the growth of the radicles of the embryos of both spruce species during the germination stage. Moreover, the intensity of the growth of the hypocotyls and radicles of P. omorika germinating embryos depended on the Phytagel concentration applied to the maturation medium. The starch content and the starch accumulation pattern of Picea abies and P. omorika somatic embryos were dependent on the concentration of ABA, sucrose or Phytagel in the maturation medium. In general, during development, the P. abies somatic embryos accumulated a much greater amount of starch than P. omorika embryos did. The effects of ABA and osmoticum on the starch accumulation pattern of Picea abies and P. omorika somatic embryos are first reported in this paper.",

    "abstract": "We have investigated the influence of mechanical wounding of Arabidopsis rosette leaves on photochemical activity of photosystem II, gas exchange, sugar content and sucrose metabolism in wild-type plants and mutants impaired in hormonal balance. The aos (jasmonate deficiency), rcd1 (reduced sensitivity to ABA, ethylene, and methyl-jasmonate), and ein4 (ethylene insensitivity) mutants have been used. Generally, mechanical injury led to dynamic changes in metabolism, especially in sugar and carotenoid contents. Whereas all mutants showed lower photosynthesis and respiration in comparison to the wild-type plants, leaf wounding caused a decrease in respiration in aos and ein4, and an increase in respiration in wild type. The mechanical injury triggered an increase of the activities of sucrose hydrolysing enzymes, such as sucrose synthase (SuSy) and several types of invertases, which was most evident in case of rcd1 and aos plants. This was correlated with injury-related changes in soluble sugars in the mutants, but not in wild-type plants where sugar content was not significantly affected by wounding. The results confirm the key role of stress hormones, such as jasmonate and ethylene, in mediating stress responses after wounding. The outcome of the experiments also underlines important roles of SuSy and invertase in regeneration of injured tissues, most probably by providing precursors for cell wall biosynthesis and by modulating sugar-signalling in plant cells.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Crop production and growth are severely affected by salt stress. Nevertheless, the bio-fertilizer vermicompost (VC) can be participated as a potent inhibitor of salinity on plant growth and crop production by regulating photosynthetic efficiency. We investigated the effect of VC on photosynthetic performance of salt-stressed broad bean ( Vicia faba L. Aspani cultivar). Seeds were grown in soil mixture; clay and sand in ratio 1:2 by volume with five different volumetric ratios of VC; 0, 2.5, 5, 10 and 15% irrigated with either water and/or 200 mM NaCl. Leaf area, Na and K contents, chlorophylls, photosystem II efficiency, Rubisco content, soluble sugars, chloroplasts’ organization and proteomics were analyzed. The imposed stress decrease leaf area, chlorophyll contents, maximum quantum efficiency (Fv/Fm), Rubisco content, increase soluble sugars and damage chloroplasts organization. Salinity upregulated glucose-1-phosphate adenylyl transferase, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase large subunit and chloroplastic peptidyl-prolyl cis–trans isomerase. The increased leaf area, chlorophyll a , b and carotenoids, maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II, Rubisco content, improving the degeneration of thylakoid lamellae and lessening plastoglobuli number in thylakoid membranes are the major benefits attained with vermicompost treatments under salt stress. Analysis of proteomic revealed that VC upregulated chloroplastic ferredoxin–NADP reductase, plastocyanin, polyphenol oxidase, peptidyl-prolyl cis–trans isomerase, alpha-glucan phosphorylase H isozyme and maturase expression under salt stress. The results suggest that VC controls protein expression at the level of transcriptional and translational which may conserve photosynthetic components and prevent salt-induced harmful effects in broad bean plants.",

In this paper we present a study focused on recognizing the relationship between psbO gene activity and acclimation of the photosynthetic apparatus under abiotic stresses in the grasses Festuca arundinacea and F. pratensis. PsbO expression was compared between two distinct genotypes within each species which differed in their levels of stress tolerance (drought and frost, respectively) during drought treatment (F. arundinacea) and cold acclimation (F. pratensis). The research involved: (1) the analyses of psbO gene expression profiles using real-time PCR, and (2) the analyses of PsbO protein accumulation profiles using protein gel blot hybridization. The results indicate that PsbO plays a protective function with respect to the photosynthetic apparatus during abiotic stresses. In cold-treated F. pratensis plants the accumulation of PsbO seems to be responsible for differences in the PSII photochemical efficiency. Higher stability of PSII during drought, observed in the high-drought tolerant F. arundinacea genotype, is not associated with PsbO accumulation, although the degradation of this protein affects destabilization of the oxygen-evolving complex in drought.",

    "abstract": "On the cross-roads of main carbon and nitrogen metabolic pathways, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH, E.C. 1.4.1.2) carries out the reaction of reductive amination of 2-oxoglutarate to glutamate (the anabolic activity; NAD(P)H–GDH), and the reverse reaction of oxidative deamination of glutamic acid (the catabolic activity; NAD(P)+–GDH). To date, there have been no reports on identification of GDH genes in cereals. Here, we report cloning and biochemical characterization of the GDH from germinating triticale seeds, a common Polish cereal. A single TsGDH1 gene is 1,620 bp long, while its 1,236 bp long open reading frame encodes a protein of 411 amino acids of high homology with the published GDH protein sequences from other plants. Phylogenetic analyses locate the TsGDH1 among other monocotyledonous proteins and among the sequences of the β-type subunit of plant GDHs. Changes in TsGDH1 expression and the dynamics of enzyme activity in germinating seeds confirm the existence of one TsGDH isoform with varying expression and activity patterns, depending on the tissue localization and stage of germination. The four-step purification method (including the anionite chromatography using HPLC) resulted in a protein preparation with a high-specific activity and purification factor of approx. 230. The purified enzyme exhibited an absolute specificity towards 2-oxoglutarate (NAD(P)H–GDH), or towards l-glutamate in the reverse reaction (NAD(P)+–GDH), while its low K m constants towards all substrates and co-enzymes may suggest its aminating activity during germination, or, alternatively, its capability to adjust the direction of the catalyzed reaction according to the metabolic necessity.",

    "abstract": "Vernalization-induced flowering is an effect of the epigenetic regulation of gene expression through DNA methylation and histone modifications. Vernalization-mediated silencing of a floral repressor through histone modifications was shown in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, for Brassica napus L., the mechanism underlying vernalization is unclear, and the roles of DNA methylation and histone modifications have not been established. This study revealed the profiles of changes in the DNA methylation state during vernalization (after 14, 35, 56 days) and the subsequent growth in long- or short-day photoperiods (after 2, 7, 14 days) in the winter and spring rapeseed using TLC and MSAP techniques. TLC analysis showed a significant decrease in the amount of 5-methylcytosine (m5C) in genomic DNA in both cultivars at the beginning of vernalization, but upon its termination, the winter rape showed a reduced level of m5C contrary to a significantly increased level in the spring rape. MSAP analysis revealed that winter and spring rapeseed differed in the MSAP loci which were demethylated/methylated in the course of the experiment and presented diverse profiles of changes in the methylation state. The winter rape showed permanent demethylations at 69.2 % of MSAP loci in the course of vernalization that were mostly preserved upon its termination. The spring rape showed similar numbers of demethylations and methylations that were mainly transient. The study provides evidence of the role of DNA methylation in vernalization for rapeseed and for the significant prevalence of demethylations at the beginning of vernalization, which is necessary for the transition to reproductive growth.",

    "abstract": "In some regions of the world, low annual precipitation necessitates irrigation of crop plants which usually leads to soil salinity. Due to climatic changes this effect is also expected in the countries of Central Europe, and so in Poland. The aim of the study was (1) to compare tolerance to salt stress of Polish Triticum aestivum cvs. 'Bogatka' and 'Banderola' with T. durum cv. 'Komnata' and breeding line 121, and (2) to indicate the physiological parameter/parameters most suitable for such comparison. The investigation was performed in two experiments. In the first one, the germination ability of caryopses and coleoptiles' growth were estimated at 0–250 mM of NaCl. The second experiment was conducted on plants grown in a glasshouse in saline soil at 0–150 mM of NaCl for 6 weeks. Salt tolerance was evaluated on the basis of following parameters: chlorophyll fluorescence, net photosynthesis rate (P N), transpiration rate (E), stomatal conductance (g s), cell membrane permeability (EL), proline content, fresh weight (FW), dry weight (DW), and relative water content (RWC). Highest germination of caryopses of durum cultivars was recorded at all the salinity levels; however, their coleoptiles were shorter than coleoptiles of bread wheat cultivars. Analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence showed that applied salt doses did not disturb the light phase of photosynthesis in all cultivars under study. Plants of durum wheat showed the higher dissipation of energy excess at the level of the antenna chlorophyll (DIo/CSm) under salinity as compared to plants of bread wheat. Both 'Komnata' and line 121 showed stronger P N reduction as an effect of salinity. A decline of P N was closely connected with a decrease in g s. The P N correlated with a decrease in DW in all studied cultivars except 'Bogatka'. Control plants of 'Komnata' and line 121 were characterized by higher EL and proline level than bread wheat cultivars. An increasing cell membrane permeability correlated with a decrease of RWC in 'Banderola' and 'Komnata'. The content of proline under the increasing salinity correlated with changes of RWC in 'Banderola', 'Komnata' and line 121, which indicate protectoral role of proline against dehydration of tissue. Dry weight and RWC seem to be the parameters most useful in the salt-tolerance estimation of wheat plants. Taking into account the studied parameters 'Banderola' could be recognized as more salt tolerant, the degree of salinity tolerance of 'Bogatka' is the same as line 121, while 'Komnata' seems to be the most salt sensitive. The salt tolerance of T. aestivum and T. durum depends on the cultivar rather than the wheat species.",

    "abstract": "The morphological and physiological responses of barley to moderate Pi deficiency and the ability of barley to grow on phytate were investigated. Barley cultivars (Hordeum vulgare L., Promyk, Skald and Stratus) were grown for 1–3 weeks on different nutrient media with contrasting phosphorus source: KH2PO4 (control), phytic acid (PA) and without phosphate (−P). The growth on −P medium strongly decreased Pi concentration in the tissues; culture on PA medium generally had no effect on Pi level. Decreased content of Pi reduced shoot and root mass but root elongation was not affected; Pi deficit had slightly greater impact on growth of barley cv. Promyk than other varieties. Barley varieties cultured on PA medium showed similar growth to control. Extracellular acid phosphatase activities (APases) in −P roots were similar to control, but in PA plants were lower. Histochemical visualization indicated for high APases activity mainly in the vascular tissues of roots and in rhizodermis. Pi deficiency increased internal APase activities mainly in shoot of barley cv. Stratus and roots of cv Promyk; growth on PA medium had no effect or decreased APase activity. Protein extracts from roots and shoots were run on native discontinuous PAGE to determine which isoforms may be affected by Pi deficiency or growth on PA medium; two of four isoforms in roots were strongly induced by conditions of Pi deficit, especially in barley cv. Promyk. In conclusion, barley cultivars grew equally well both on medium with Pi and where the Pi was replaced with phytate and only slightly differed in terms of acclimation to moderate deficiency of phosphate; they generally used similar pools of acid phosphatases to acquire Pi from external or internal sources.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to analyze the mechanism of some physiological processes accompanying acquisition of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) chilling resistance due to seeds hydropriming in the presence of salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, 24-epibrassinolide followed exposition of seeds to short-term heat shock treatment. The seeds were hydroprimed at 25 °C in limited amounts of water or solution of salicylic or jasmonic acid at 10−2, 10−3 and 10−4 M concentration, 24-epibrassinolide at 10−6, 10−8 and 10−10 M concentration. The seeds were incubated for 2 days, subjected to short-term heat shock (45 °C, 2 h) and chilled for 21 days at 0 °C. Sunflower chilling susceptibility and physiological responses were evaluated according to the inhibition of radicle growth, the inhibition of the number of lateral roots formation, the activity of catalase and changes in soluble carbohydrates in seedlings developing for 72 h at 25 °C. Hydropriming and short-term heat shock application explicitly reduced inhibition of roots as well as lateral roots development by allowing the germinating seeds to recover from the growth-inhibiting effects of chilling. Seeds hydropriming in solutions containing salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and 24-epibrassinolide followed heat shock treatment additionally promoted the activity of catalase and sugars metabolism, which stimulated seedlings development and alleviated the decrease of F v/F m caused by chilling conditions. These beneficial effects contributed to increased resistance of sunflower seedlings to chilling stress. The present study demonstrated that the most profitable effect on reducing negative effect of chilling may be achieved by short-term heat shock applied during hydropriming in water supplemented with 24-epiBL (10−8 and 10−10 M) or salicylic acid (10−3 and 10−4 M).",

    "abstract": "The great agronomic potential of Lupinus luteus, species widely cultivated in many European countries as well as Australia, is strongly affected by premature and excessive generative organ abscission, mainly flowers. The unwanted process takes place in a specialized group of cells, called abscission zone (AZ). During their development they become competent to respond to external and internal factors, including phytohormones. Recently it was shown that the formation of AZ cells in Arabidopsis thaliana is coordinated by transcription factors, BLADE-ON-PETIOLE (BOPs). There is no such data, excluding tobacco plants, about BOP-dependent regulation of organ abscission in crop plants. In this work, we examined LlBOP mRNA content during generative organs AZ development and functioning. The high accumulation of LlBOP transcript was accompanied by the differentiation of morphologically distinct cells at the base of the mature flower pedicel. Moreover, enhanced LlBOP expression was observed in the active AZ, and was regulated by factors, which can strongly affect generative organ abscission. All these data indicate that LlBOP is involved in the abscission zone formation and functioning in L. luteus.",

The best response in terms of shoot proliferation (about seven shoots/explant) and shoot length (3.2 ± 0.4 cm) was obtained when explants pretreated with 25 µmol L−1 TDZ for 6 h were cultured on Schenk and Hildebrandt medium containing indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) (0.57 µmol L−1) and 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) (8 µmol L−1). Under these conditions, a 330 % increase in shoot multiplication over TDZ non-pretreatment culture was achieved and TDZ pretreatment shoots were longer compared to those in control culture (2.6 ± 0.3 cm). The TDZ pretreatment did not affect the percentage of rooted shoots, length of roots and number of roots formed per shoot. The rooted plantlets were transplanted from in vitro to pots with soil and grown during 1 year in the greenhouse. The hardening process was difficult and time-consuming. We found that the plants developed from the TDZ pretreated culture were superior to plants from non-pretreated culture in terms of survival rate and morphological features, such as shoot length, leaf size, flowering and earlier root tuberisation. Random amplified polymorphic DNA and inter-simple sequence repeat analyses of pretreatment with TDZ plants showed genetic similarity to non-pretreatment plants. We conclude that applying the strategy of initial explant pretreatment with TDZ may be valuable for the improvement in H. procumbens in vitro propagation.",

Shoot multiplication obtained on Murashige and Skoog medium containing 0.05 mg L−1 2,4-dichloro-phenoxyacetic acid and 1 mg L−1 6-benzyladenine (BA), was about twice higher in light-grown cultures than those in darkness. Light-grown explants showed also higher rate of roots regeneration (in medium containing 1 mg L−1 α-naphtaleneacetic acid and 0.05 mg L-1 BA) than dark-grown ones. The cyanogenic potential (expressed both as linamarin and lotaustralin content and linamarase activity) of flax cultured in vitro was tissue-specific and generally was higher under light conditions than in darkness. The highest concentration of linamarin and lotaustralin was detected in light-regenerated shoots, and its amount was twice as high as in roots, and about threefold higher than in callus tissue. The activities of linamarase and β-cyanoalanine synthase in light-regenerated organs were also higher than those in darkness. Thus, higher frequency of regeneration of light-grown cultures than dark-grown ones seems to be correlated with higher HCN-p of these tissues. We suggest that free HCN, released from cyanoglucosides potentially at higher level under light conditions, may be involved in some organogenetic processes which improve regeneration efficiency.",

Hicksii transgenic root lines (ATMA and ATM) carrying the taxadiene synthase transgene was investigated. SNP addition, when applied together with MJ and/or PHEN, resulted in paclitaxel production only in ATMA cultures. The application of the NO donor gave the highest paclitaxel content (7.56 mg l−1) in the combination of SNP+S+MJ+PHEN, after 2 weeks of treatment in the ATMA root line. In ATM cultures, taxane production was not affected by SNP. In both ATMA and ATM lines the highest total (intra+extracellular) paclitaxel yield was determined when elicited with MJ+PHEN, and amounted to 10.78 mg l−1 at 1 week and 1.63 mg l−1 at 2 weeks of treatment, in cultures of ATMA and ATM lines, respectively. The excretion of paclitaxel was observed only in ATMA cultures, with the highest level (2.34 mg l−1) obtained after elicitation with S+MJ+PHEN. The comparison of PAL activity in the two root lines revealed that this enzyme was almost 3-times more active in ATM than ATMA roots. An increase in both PAL activity and paclitaxel production was only observed in ATMA cultures growing in medium supplemented with S+MJ+PHEN.",

    "abstract": "Callus, cell suspension, and shoot cultures as well as in vitro-derived plants of Scutellaria alpina grown under greenhouse (for 3 months) and field conditions (for 2 years) were established, and their flavonoid (baicalin, wogonoside, luteolin) and phenylethanoid glycoside (verbascoside) contents were determined by ultra performance liquid chromatography. The quantities of individual compounds were influenced by the type of analyzed plant material, its age, and day of culture passage. Undifferentiated callus and cell suspension cultures of S. alpina showed higher amounts of metabolites than the proliferating shoot cultures. The highest baicalin (26.25 mg g−1 dry wt) and wogonoside (15.60 mg g−1 dry wt) levels were found in callus cultured for 1.5–2 years on MS agar medium supplemented with NAA (0.1 mg l−1) and TDZ (0.2 mg l−1), which were similar to these yielded by 3-month-old and 2-year-old plant roots of S. alpina. The maximum level of verbascoside (27.21 mg g−1 dry wt) was achieved in cell suspension culture maintained for 1 year in MS liquid medium with NAA (0.1 mg l−1) and TDZ (0.2 mg l−1). The amount was found to be about 3–4-fold higher than in shoots and roots of S. alpina micropropagated plants grown in field condition (7.2–9.7 mg g−1 dry wt). Our results suggest that in vitro cultures of S. alpina represent effective system for the production of the bioactive compounds with different pharmacological activity during long-term subculturing.",

    "abstract": "A simple and reliable technique for in vitro multiplication and long-term preservation using liquid nitrogen was developed for gametophytes of Osmunda regalis. The effect of Knop's medium and various concentrations (1/2, 1/4, 1/8) of mineral salts provided in Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal medium, together in the presence or absence of both ammonium nitrate and a full complement of vitamins on gametophyte proliferation and sporophyte production was determined. Moreover, the effectiveness of gametophyte cryopreservation by vitrification and encapsulation–vitrification techniques was assessed. Maximum gametophyte proliferation (89 %) occurred on the ammonium nitrate- and vitamin-free [(-NH4NO3)(-vit)] MS medium with 1/2 or 1/4 strength mineral salts. The maximum production of sporophytes (30 plantlets per gametophyte clump) required 1/8MS (-NH4NO3)(-vit) medium. The flow cytometric analysis revealed that the sporophytes contained twofold more pg DNA than gametophytes. This confirmed that the sporophytes were obtained by sexual reproduction. The vitrification protocol and PVS2 solution were ineffective for cryopreservation. The greatest survival rate (81.6 %) following cryo-exposure occurred following treatment of encapsulated gametophytes with PVS3 solution for 3 h. This protocol allowed the recovery of gametophyte cultures following 6 weeks after rewarming. Finally, 100 % of sporophytes produced in vitro were successfully acclimated to ex vitro conditions. Application of the in vitro and cryopreservation methods made it possible to improve the number and time of O. regalis sporophyte production. Whole system of micropropagation can be completed in approximately 1 year. The protocols open new avenues for the mass propagation, germplasm conservation and resource management of the species.",

    "abstract": "Four species of flowering plants comprising Arctic populations of Cerastium alpinum and Poa arctica var. vivipara and indigenous Antarctic species Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica were investigated. Plants derived from natural origins were grown in an experimental greenhouse in Poland (53°47′N and 20°30′E latitude). Plants for experiment were collected during spring of 2010. Soluble carbohydrates in the intact shoots of C. alpinum and C. quitensis, polar plants of the family Caryophyllaceae, and D. antarctica and P. arctica var. vivipara, representatives of the family Poaceae, were analyzed by gas chromatography, and their involvement in the plants' response to chilling stress was examined. Plant tissues of the examined families growing in a greenhouse conditions (18–20 °C, short day 10/14 h light/darkness) differed in the content and composition of soluble carbohydrates. In addition to common monosaccharides, myo-inositol and sucrose, Caryophyllaceae plants contained raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs), d-pinitol and mono-galactosyl pinitols. RFOs and d-pinitol were not detected in plants of the family Poaceae which contain 1-kestose, a specific tri-saccharide. The accumulation of significant quantities of sucrose in all investigated plants, RFOs in Caryophyllaceae plants and 1-kestose in Poaceae plants in response to chilling stress (4 °C for 48 h with a long day photoperiod, 20/4 h) indicates that those compounds participate in the stress response. The common sugar accumulating in cold stress response and probably most important for chilling tolerance of four investigated plants species seems to be sucrose. On the other hand, the accumulation of above-mentioned carbohydrates during chilling stress can be a return to sugars metabolism, occurring in natural environmental conditions. No changes in d-pinitol concentrations were observed in the tissues of C. alpinum and C. quitensis plants subjected to both low and elevated temperatures, which probably rules out the protective effects of d-pinitol in response to cold stress.",

However, in chlorophyllous spores in particular, the problem is not yet fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of moisture content (MC; 6.6 and 4.6 %) and storage temperature (15 and −196 °C) on spore germination and gametophyte development in Osmunda regalis. The MC (fresh weight basis) in freshly released spores was 7.5 %, and decreased to 6.6 and 4.6 % during 2 weeks of spore storage at 42 and 18 % relative humidity, respectively. Those spores germinated at 99.9 % within 28 h. The spores with 6.6 and 4.6 % MC were used for the storage at 15 and −196 °C. The deterioration of spores, maintained with 6.6 % MC, proceeds within 1.5 years of storage at 15 °C, starting with month 8. For the spores with 4.6 % MC serious disturbances in germination and capacity to gametophyte development were postponed for more than 6 months. The time required for spore germination increased with the age of the spores, ranging from 28 h in fresh spores to 10 days in spores stored for more than 11 months. Following 7-year-long cryostorage, spore viability remained at 99.9 %, the time taken for germination remained unaltered and gametophyte development was normal. The viability and vigor of spores were directly correlated with their age, the moisture content and storage temperature.",

The present study describes in vitro conservation of Senecio macrophyllus by slow-growth storage. Various sugar treatments, concentration of abscisic acid (ABA), light intensity and type of containers were tested. Viability and proliferation rate of shoots were evaluated 4 weeks after regrowth. The results obtained showed that polycarbonate boxes were a better type of containers for storage of S. macrophyllus shoots than glass vessels. Light negatively affected culture viability, multiplication rate and rooting response. In the case of Senecio macrophyllus the addition of ABA to storage medium stimulated survival and higher proliferation of shoots during regrowth in optimal conditions in comparison to shoots stored on medium without ABA. Shoots of S. macrophyllus were effectively stored for 6 months. All rooted shoots survived adaptation to field conditions and were able to flower in the second year after acclimatization.",

    "abstract": "For over 20 years, trees of Aesculus spp. have been attacked by the larvae of Cameraria ohridella, which causes damage to the leaves. It has been observed that members of the genus Aesculus are characterized by diverse susceptibility to C. ohridella. Four specimens of the Aesculus genus which differ in susceptibility to this leaf miner—Aesculus turbinata (susceptible), Aesculus × neglecta (resistant) and two specimens of Aesculus hippocastanum (relatively susceptible and relatively resistant)—were examined. The levels of substances which may function as attractants (chloroplast pigments, anthocyanins), deterrents or repellents (flavonols, phenols), or a source of nutrients (free α-amino acids and carbohydrates) were determined in leaves of these four trees during two growing seasons. The results showed that the more pest-susceptible A. turbinata had, in both growing seasons, significantly higher levels of leaf carbohydrates and anthocyanins than the resistant Ae. × neglecta. Thus, anthocyanins and carbohydrates may be the traits which affect oviposition preference and favor the feeding of C. ohridella in the susceptible Ae. turbinata. The relatively susceptible specimen of Ae. hippocastanum contained slightly higher carbohydrate and anthocyanin levels than the relatively resistant one, but only in one growing season. Therefore, it does not explain the causes of their different susceptibility to the pest. The concentration of phenolics in the susceptible Ae. turbinata tree and the relatively susceptible Ae. hippocastanum individual was higher than in the resistant Ae. × neglecta and relatively resistant Ae. hippocastanum, respectively. This may suggest that leaf phenolic composition, but not overall concentration, is responsible for different susceptibility of examined trees of Aesculus spp. to the horse-chestnut leaf miner. The present results also demonstrate that the determined chemical compounds do not constitute a complete description of the biochemical relationships between C. ohridella and the examined horse-chestnut trees.",

Such action of this element is not fully recognized and is currently being intensively studied. The influence of manganese, at high (1, 2 and 3 mM) concentrations, on the induction of oxidative stress in wheat cells was studied under in vitro conditions. Calli of two wheat cultivars, different in terms of stress tolerance, were cultured for 7 days on Murashige–Skoog media with or without auxin (2,4-D) and with additional Mn supplementation. Changes of malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration and the activity of enzymes (SOD, CAT and POX) involved in oxidative response as well as the accumulation of Mn and elements essential for plant development (Mn, Mg, S, Ca, K, P, Na, Zn, Mo, Cu, Fe) were detected. Moreover, proline and carbohydrate contents were determined to check the induction of osmotic stress. An increase of lipid peroxidation (expressed by MDA content), induced by ROS generation, was smaller in the tolerant ('Parabola') cultivar than in the sensitive one ('Raweta'). The activation of antioxidative enzymes was more effective in the cells of tolerant wheat, where a lower quantity of Mn was accumulated. Mn uptake was correlated with a decrease of an amount of almost all the investigated elements. Auxin presence in the culture media accelerated the stressogenic effect of Mn.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The cereal aphids Rhopalosiphum padi L. are serious pests on grain crops, reducing the quality and yield by direct feeding damage and virus transmission. The changes in the physiological and biochemical parameters of two wheat cultivars under aphid stress were investigated to understand aphid-resistance mechanisms. The activity levels of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), peroxidase (POD), tyrosine ammonia-lyase (TAL), Ca 2+ -ATPase and Mg 2+ -ATPase in resistant cultivar W0923 increased during aphid feeding, and most of them were significantly higher than those in the susceptible cultivar GN21. However, these enzyme activities increased and then decreased in GN21. The polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity in W0923 was maintained longer than in GN21. The total phenol contents of the two cultivars exhibited significant increases on the 15th day compared with the untreated controls, and the content in W0923 was significantly higher than in GN21 by the 30th day. Most of the POD, PPO, PAL, TAL and Ca 2+ -ATPase activities and phenolic metabolite contents were higher in W0923 than in GN21 under the untreated control conditions. The Ca 2+ -ATPase and PAL activities positively correlated with POD, PPO and Mg 2+ -ATPase activities. Ca 2+ -ATPase and PAL may be key biochemical markers for evaluating aphid resistance. W0923 had a strong ability to maintain higher enzyme activities and synthesize more phenols and tannins than GN21, which contributed to aphid resistance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Studies concerning abscisic acid (ABA) involvement in root system architecture (RSA) and the interaction of ABA with auxin have reported contrasting results. In this study, the effects of exogenous ABA application and withdrawal as well as a combined treatment of ABA with the synthetic auxin 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) were thoroughly investigated in maize. The results showed that ABA reduced both the primary root (PR) elongation and the lateral root density (LRD), whereas NAA inhibited PR elongation but increased LRD. The combined treatment involving ABA and NAA inhibited PR elongation. Regarding ABA withdrawal, PR elongation was restored when ABA was removed from the growth media, but LRD was not restored after ABA withdrawal. However, the results of the combined treatment showed that auxin can reverse the inhibitory effect of ABA on LRD. A more in-depth analysis revealed that the inhibitory effect of ABA on lateral root (LR) formation depends on the stage of development. Exogenously added ABA blocked the development of lateral root primordia (LRPs) in the early stages, but was unable to inhibit the elongation of developed LRPs. These results suggest that ABA arrests the formation of LRPs rather than the growth and emergence of LRPs and their subsequent elongation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In recent years, heat stress has become a serious threat to rice production in China. It is well documented that nitrogen forms can regulate the heat tolerance of plants. However, its effect on the rice plants has not been described before. In this study, a pot experiment was performed with two restorer lines of indica rice, heat-tolerant 996 (HT 996) and heat-sensitive 343 (HS 343), to investigate whether nitrogen forms could mitigate heat stress at flowering stage and their physiological mechanism. The experiment received five treatments: (1) NN0: natural temperature level (32 ℃) with urea-N; (2) HN0: high temperature level (38 ℃) with urea-N; (3) HN1: high temperature level with NH 4 + -N; (4) HN2: high temperature level with mixed N [NH 4 + : NO 3 − at 50: 50 (w:w)]; and (5) HN3: high temperature level with NO 3 − -N, respectively. The results showed that heat stress reduced seed setting, photosynthetic characteristics, leaf nitrogen content and antioxidant enzyme activities of rice. However, the application of mixed N significantly increased the 1000-grain weight and seed setting rate under heat stress, thus increasing yield. The increased yield was mainly caused by higher leaf N content, photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate and stomatal conductance, which led to a reduction in panicle and leaf temperatures. Meanwhile, the application of mixed N also improved the activities of antioxidant enzymes, and reduced the amount of reactive oxygen species, thereby mitigating the damage caused by exposure to high temperature. In conclusion, the application of mixed N can effectively alleviate the adverse consequences of high temperature, and could be further applied to provide strategies for the prevention and control of high temperature-prone areas during the rice flowering period.",

    "abstract": "High productive suspension cultures of Genista tinctoria were elicited (methyl jasmonate or chitosan) and permeabilised (dimethyl sulfoxide) in order to achieve a plant in vitro system rich in isoflavones, with extracellular storage profile. The maximum concentration of isoflavone aglycones (4–6 times higher than in the controlled biomass) was obtained in the suspension elicited with chitosan. All isoflavonoids were stored inside cells. In case of methyl jasmonate supplementation the total concentration of isoflavone aglycones achieved was the result of the de novo biosynthesis as well as a hydrolysis of the storage ester forms. The presence of chitosan in the medium was only associated with the production of aglycones de novo. The elicitors had no effect on the accumulation and metabolism of the basic glycoside isoflavones in the suspension. The change in the way the isoflavones were stored was achieved after supplementing the growth media with dimethyl sulfoxide. Maximum concentration of isoflavones in the medium was observed in the 7th hour of the experiment. Eventually, a plant growth system was developed, producing over 11% of isoflavones, ejected as a result of chemical permeabilisation, into the growth medium (approx. 80% of total amount of these compounds in the biomass).",

    "abstract": "Age and shade effects on needle structure and photosynthesis were determined within a lower part of Abies alba crown along a horizontal increasing gradient of branches self-shading. It was hypothesized that a decrease in net CO2 assimilation rate with increasing needles' age would be related to: (1) structural age-related changes in needles, (2) reduction of stomatal conductance, (3) nitrogen translocation from old to young needles, and (4) decrease in efficiency of photochemical processes. Leaf mass-to-area ratio increased non-linearly with needle age. In a needle cross section, distance between the vascular bundles decreased, and height of palisade parenchyma cells increased with age. The structural changes observed in our study might lead to an increase in internal resistance to CO2 with greater needle age. Total needle nitrogen concentration linearly decreased with age due to dilution and/or translocation to younger needles. When expressed per needle area, nitrogen content was reduced in 6-year-old needles compared with younger ones. Net CO2 assimilation rate per needle area decayed and was accompanied by a decrease in transpiration and water and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency. Old needles maintained high photochemical efficiency which compensated to some extent for light deficit in their micro-light environments. Our results have suggested that there is a mechanism controlling the relation between efficiency of light and dark photosynthetic processes along the needle age and shade gradient in A. alba crown.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the present study was to recognize the molecular background of the accumulation of raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs) in pea (Pisum sativum L.) seedlings under osmotic stress conditions. The exposure of 5-day-old pea seedlings to osmotic stress for 48 h created by immersing roots in PEG8000 solution (−1.5 MPa) induced synthesis of galactinol and RFOs (raffinose and stachyose) in the epicotyl and root tissues, but not in cotyledons. After 24 h of recovery, galactinol completely disappeared, raffinose decreased fourfold and stachyose decreased twofold in roots, but increased in epicotyls. The temporary accumulation of RFOs resulted from a dramatic increase in the enzymatic activity and changes in expression of galactinol synthase (PsGolS), raffinose synthase (PsRS) and stachyose synthase (PsSTS) genes. PsGolS was induced by osmotic stress in both epicotyls as well as in roots. PsRS and PsSTS were induced only in epicotyls, but repressed or remained unaffected in roots, respectively. During recovery, the expression and activity of PsGolS, PsRS and PsSTS dramatically decreased. The expression of PsGolS gene, that level of mRNA transcript significantly decreased during recovery and whose promoter region was identified to contain some stress-related regulating elements, seems to play a crucial role in the biosynthesis of RFOs under osmotic stress. Possible signals that may trigger the induction of expression of PsGolS, PsRS and PsSTS genes and accumulation of RFOs in pea seedlings are discussed.",

With the future in mind, the aim of our study was to search for physiological and biochemical parameters which could provide a basis for the identification of genes controlling rye resistance to drought stress. The experiments were carried out on three inbred lines of rye: S120, S76 and M112, a recombinant inbred line of population RIL-M; lines in the tillering phase were subjected to drought stress for 4 weeks. Selected physiological indicators of PSII photochemical system [chlorophyll a fluorescence kinetics (FC) and photosynthetic pigment contents (PPC)], biochemical indicators (proline, soluble sugars, total phenolics) and selected agronomic traits were determined. Drought did not significantly affect the majority of the measured FC and PPC parameters in any of the three lines. Due to the different reactions of the lines to drought stress, depending on the analyzed characteristics, the authors concluded that the analyzed indicators can be used to study QTL locations in response to drought stress in the RIL-M mapping population of rye.",

In this study, we investigated: (1) the response of grass pea seedlings to osmotic stress generated in vitro by polyethylene glycol (PEG); (2) potential drought acclimatization mechanisms of two polish grass pea cultivars. Grass pea seeds of two cultivars were sown on media containing different PEG concentrations (0, 5.5, 11.0 mM) and cultivated for 14 days in controlled conditions. Plants’ dry matter increased under osmotic stress (regardless of PEG concentration). In turn, the highest dose of PEG caused a reduction in seedling growth in both cultivars. Furthermore, PEG caused the peroxidase activity increase in whole seedlings and catalase (CAT) activity in roots. However, differences between cultivars were noted in: CAT activity in shoots; while phenols and anthocyanin content as well as electrolyte leakage in shoots and roots. In turn, in both tested genotypes, accumulation of proline increased in shoots under osmotic stress. Obtained results indicate that the examined plants, although belonging to the same species, differ in acclimatization processes leading to elevated tolerance to osmotic stress.",

    "abstract": "A very small percentage, below 10%, of Amaranthus retroflexus seeds were germinated at 25 °C in the light and thus the seeds were considered to be primary dormant. Nitric oxide (NO) applied for only 5 h stimulated germination of these non-deep physiologically dormant seeds. Likewise, ethephon, ethylene, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) and gibberellic acid (GA3) induced dormancy release. The stimulatory effect of NO, ACC, and GA3 on germination was associated with increased ethylene production prior to radicle protrusion. The nitric oxide scavenger, cPTIO, antagonized the stimulatory effect of GA3, ethephon, and ACC on seed germination, indicating that the presence of endogenous NO is required for dormancy release by these compounds. This scavenger inhibited both germination and ethylene production stimulated by NO and GA3. An inhibitor of ethylene binding to its receptor, 2,5-norbornadiene (NBD), antagonized the beneficial effect of ethylene and NO, indicating that ethylene action is necessary for the appearance of seed response to these gases. The ACC synthase inhibitor, aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG), and the ACC oxidase inhibitor, α-amino-isobutyric acid (AIB), strengthened the effect of NBD on the germination of NO-pretreated seeds. Induction of germination of dormant seeds by NO, ethephon or GA3 was associated with initiation of the cell cycle prior to radicle protrusion. The data presented indicate NO crosstalk with ethylene and GA3 in regulating dormancy release in A. retroflexus seeds.",

    "abstract": "The freezing tolerance of 69 accessions of field-grown, common wheat (Triticum aestivum) was assessed in three consecutive winters. To measure freezing tolerance directly, field-grown plants were subjected to a range of freezing temperatures in a controlled environment and plant regrowth was subsequently assessed. Indirect assessments of freezing tolerance, as measured by chlorophyll fluorescence transient measurements followed by a JIP-test (an in vivo measurement of the adaptive behavior of the photosynthetic apparatus), were performed on detached leaves frozen at the same time as whole plants. Both direct and indirect tests were also used on plants cold acclimated in the laboratory. These results were compared with results of a field survival study performed at seven experimental sites. An analysis of the data indicated that only some of the JIP-test parameters were suitable for the prediction of freezing tolerance and winter survival. Estimates of cold hardiness were very similar, regardless of the experimental year, but were dependent on the method of cold acclimation and time of sampling. Indirect measurements of cold hardiness were more in line with the field survival data for field-cold-acclimated plants sampled in mid-winter than for plants that were either sampled earlier or cold acclimated in the laboratory. Indirect measurements taken on leaves that had not frozen failed to provide accurate estimates of cold hardiness. Our observations, together with previously reported findings, indicate that cold acclimation under natural field conditions activates a greater array of freezing tolerance mechanisms than cold acclimation performed in under controlled environmental conditions in a laboratory.",

Achievements in plant physiology and biochemistry uncovered many metabolic pathways and defined indicators of plant resistance to environmental stresses. Genetic research contributed to discoveries of gene regulation in stress tolerance. As the result of fast development of genetics, phenomics became a hold-up of further functional research. In this paper, problems related to phenotype requirements for crops cultivation in drought threatened areas will be presented against the background of achievements in metabolomics and genomics. Theoretical speculations of Blum on crop water use efficiency will be examined against the results of Sirius simulation with HadCM3 climate projections and against practical phenological requirements for present crops.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to develop the method for increasing resistance of sunflower seedlings 'Wielkopolski' to chilling. Seeds were conditioned at 25 °C for 2 days in water to 15, 20 and 25 % moisture content or in salicylic or jasmonic acid in concentration of 10−2; 10−3 and 10−4 M or brassinolide in concentration of 10−6; 10−8 and 10−10–15 % moisture content. After 2 days of incubation the conditioned seeds were heat shocked at 45 °C for 0, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min and 5 mm seedlings were exposed to chilling at 0 °C for 21 days. The effectiveness of the methods was assessed by evaluation of roots growth in Phytotoxkit Microbiotest, changes in the activity of dehydrogenases, the integrity of the cytoplasmic membrane and formation of polysomes after seedling were returned to 25 °C for 72 h. Seeds were conditioned at 25 °C for 2 days in water to 15 % moisture content and then heat shocked at 45 °C for 2 h decreased chilling injury of seedlings expressed by subsequent growth of the roots, electrolyte leakage, dehydrogenases activity and polysomes formation. Application of heat shock of 45 °C for 2 h during seed conditioning additionally provided seedling protection against subsequent chilling conditions. Brasinolide, salicylic acid or jasmonic acid applied during seeds conditioning exhibited further beneficial effect on seedling resistance to chilling. The most pronounced effect was obtained due to seed conditioning to 15 % moisture content in solutions of brassinolide in concentration of 10−8 M. After 2 days of imbibition treated in this way seeds were exposed to heat shock at 45 °C for 2 h. The role of physiological events in improvement of sunflower chilling tolerance are discussed.",

This review presents the results of the changes in the lipid composition of native membranes of plant cells under stress conditions and during developmental processes. It also discussed the use of lipids to create model systems which allow for interpretation of specificity of reactions taking place in the membrane fragments. The spontaneous formation by lipids closed spherical structures (bi-layers) in an aqueous medium, and monolayers at the water/air interface creates a convenient model system for the native membranes. The review focuses on the techniques of electrokinetic potential (zeta potential) measurements and Langmuir monolayers' studies. The first gives the possibility to conclude about the modification of the polar part of the membranes, the second allows to determine their structural properties (fluidity, stiffness). The relatively rapid modification of the lipid composition under stress and during the course of developmental processes to ensure the optimal functions of membranes and organelles includes the changes of hydrophobic/hydrophilic character of lipid, as an important factor influencing the course of multiple reactions in cells. Understanding the physicochemical properties of lipids that accompany these processes may contribute to the correct description of the functionality of the cells under these conditions.",

The aim of this study was to investigate differences in the metabolic response of seeds, seedlings and leaves of Centaurea cyanus L., depending on the degree of resistance to tribenuron-methyl. Changes in the values of selected biochemical and physiological parameters (germination index, chemical composition, photochemical efficiency of photosystem II and the emission spectra of blue-green fluorescence) presented herein make it possible to determine the differences between cornflower biotypes with various types of resistance to the tested herbicide. Moreover, differences in the chemical composition of dry seeds between biotypes susceptible and resistant to tribenuron-methyl were observed before using the herbicide. The degree of resistance to the herbicide—resistant or susceptible, but not the types of this resistance-mutational or metabolic, can be distinguished on the basis of the presented parameters. These findings allow for early diagnosis of the resistance of cornflower to tribenuron-methyl. Additionally, we suggest that the described parameters might be used as physiochemical markers for early estimation of weed resistance to various types of herbicide. The presented conclusions are especially important for agricultural practice.",

    "abstract": "Florets of Avena fatua (wild oat) did not germinate at temperatures from 5 to 35 °C, nor did caryopses at 5 and above 15 °C. Smoke–water (SW) was found to partly or substantially induce dormant florets and caryopses to germinate at temperatures from 10 to 25 °C, whereby almost all caryopses germinated at 15 and 20 °C. When florets were dry-stored at 25 °C for 4 months, their dormancy, and that of florets was markedly or completely, respectively, removed at 20 °C. Floret and caryopsis SW demand decreased with time of dry storage. Paclobutrazol, a gibberellin biosynthesis inhibitor, completely antagonized the stimulatory effect of SW on germination of caryopses. Gibberellic acid (GA3) reversed inhibition caused by paclobutrazol applied alone or in combination with SW. SW enhanced α- and β-amylase activities in caryopses before radicle protrusion. SW increased α-amylase activity and reduced starch content more effectively in intact caryopses than in embryoless ones. SW enhanced β-tubulin accumulation and the transition from G1 to S and also from S to G2 phases before radicle protrusion. The results presented indicate that florets are more dormant than caryopses and less sensitive to SW at incubation temperatures from 20 °C. Germination induction of dormant Avena fatua caryopses by SW required gibberellin biosynthesis. SW induction of dormant caryopsis germination involves mobilization of starch and cell cycle activation.",

Oat (Avena sativa L.) doubled haploid (DH) lines obtained by pollination of F 1 oat crosses with maize were used to assess the differences in plant genotypic response to soil drought. The investigations were based on the measurements of gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence kinetics. Drought was applied to 17-day-old seedlings by withholding water for 14 days and subsequent plant recovery. Non-stressed optimally watered plants served as controls. Yield components were determined when plants reached full maturity. It was shown differences among the oat lines with respect to drought stress susceptibility (SI) and stress tolerance index mean productivity and drought susceptibility index. Sensitivity to drought of individual DH lines was significantly different, as demonstrated by the correlation between drought susceptibility index and yield components, such as dry weight (GW) or grain number (GN) of the harvested plants. GW and GN were lower in drought-sensitive genotypes exposed to drought stress compared to those resistant to drought. The principal component analysis allow to separate three groups of lines differing in their sensitivity to drought stress and indicated that tolerance to drought in oat has a common genetic background.",

    "abstract": "Wheat is the second most important food crop worldwide, and thus, it is important to protect both its yield and quality. Cadmium (Cd) is a heavy metal with strong soil–plant mobility and biological toxicity. Thus, screening low-Cd-accumulating genotypes to elucidate the underlying molecular regulatory mechanisms and gene networks related to Cd stress may be useful to reduce dietary exposure to this heavy metal. Here, the root transcriptomes of the low-Cd-accumulating genotype YM16 treated (YT) or not treated (YC) with Cd were analyzed using the Illumina Hiseq4000 data. The gene expression analysis of YT and YC revealed 1427 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; 429 upregulated and 998 downregulated). Of these, 298 upregulated DEGs were assigned to 41 gene ontology (GO) terms, whereas 537 downregulated DEGs were assigned to 61 GO terms. The pathway enrichment analysis showed that phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, glutathione metabolism, sulfur metabolism, and nitrogen metabolism were significantly enriched in upregulated DEGs, which are involved in defense and detoxification in response to Cd stress. The expression pattern of eight selected DEGs was also analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the results were consistent with those obtained by RNA-sequencing, confirming data reliability. Overall, our study might increase the understanding of complex molecular mechanisms that regulate the responses of plants to Cd stress, and help develop new improved wheat varieties with low Cd content in the grain.",

    "abstract": "The specific function of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), a new plant growth regulator, in modulating root growth of plants and the mechanisms underlying ALA-regulated root growth are largely unknown. Here, Arabidopsis seedlings were photographed and collected before and after ALA or 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) treatment for determination of root growth, fluorescence intensities of PIN1, PIN2, PIN7, and DR5, and gene expression levels of auxin synthesis, signaling, and transport. We first demonstrated that ALA significantly promoted Arabidopsis primary root elongation. We also found that TIBA, an auxin polar transport inhibitor, inhibited ALA-promoted root elongation, indicating that auxin transport is involved in ALA-regulated root growth. Then, the observations of PIN1, PIN2, and PIN7 at protein and transcript levels suggest that ALA improves auxin transport mainly through regulating auxin efflux carriers. Furthermore, the expression patterns of auxin-responsive reporter DR5rev:GFP were not correlated well with the expression of YUC2, a key biosynthetic gene of auxin, but were consistent with changes of PIN1, PIN2, and PIN7. In addition, ALA did not affect the gene expression of auxin receptor, TRANSPORT-INHIBITOR-RESISTANT1 (TIR1). Taken together, we conclude that ALA promotes primary root elongation of young Arabidopsis seedlings mainly through improving auxin transport. Our data suggest the reciprocal interaction between ALA and auxin, providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying ALA-promoted plant root growth.",

The biomass of 30-day-old plants of barnyard grass and cleavers grown in bare soil was approximately 5- and 3.5-fold higher, respectively, than in plants grown in the presence of BRR.

    "abstract": "Abstract Lipoxygenase (LOX, EC1.13.11.12) catalyzes the oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids and further generates oxylipins via enzymatic or non-enzymatic pathways, thus participating in the regulation of growth and development, stress response, and other processes. The objective of this research was to characterize the function and evaluate the mechanism of lipoxygenase gene AfLOX4 ’s role in enhancing drought tolerance. Transcriptomic data were generated and analyzed for the LOX gene, under different concentrations of drought (polyethylene glycol-6000) (PEG6000) and abscisic acid (ABA) stress treatment, to determine their effects on the expression of the AfLOX4 gene and its role in plant physiology. The localization of the AfLOX4 protein was detected through protoplast transformation. The expression of AfLOX4 in Amorpha fruticosa tissues was determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Six LOX genes of A. fruticosa that showed an upregulated pattern under different concentrations of drought (PEG6000) stress were found via transcriptomic analysis and were named AfLOX1 ~ 6. The AfLOX4 protein was localized in the cytoplasm. AfLOX4 was expressed in the stems, roots, flowers, and leaves of Amorpha fruticosa L., and its expression level was the highest in leaves. The expression of AfLOX4 increased with the prolongation of stress time under different stresses. After ABA treatment, the germination rate of tobacco lines overexpressing AfLOX4 was significantly increased, while under NaHCO 3 stress, the tolerance of tobacco plants overexpressing AfLOX4 was higher than that of wild-type tobacco. The tobacco with overexpression of the AfLOX4 gene detected by the natural drought method had a higher survival rate in the drought stress recovery experiment, and improved the drought tolerance of tobacco. This study reveals the function of the AfLOX4 gene in resisting drought stress and lays a solid theoretical foundation for the genetic improvement of Amorpha fruticosa L. plant varieties, as well as improvement of resource utilization.",

To understand the influence of the EMR on living organisms, we investigated the long-term effects of EMR of 50 Hz frequency on duckweed ( Lemna minor ) clones. Experimental groups of duckweed were treated directly and indirectly by changing EMR generating magnetic flux (MF) starting from 2 µT (0–11 weeks from the beginning of the experiment) and switching to 300 µT (12–48 weeks) MF density during the second part of the experiment. The growth parameters (plant growth, frond area, and frond number) and the point mutations appearing at the antioxidant genes DNA sequences [ascorbate peroxidase (APx), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase (Cat)] were analyzed. The significantly enhanced number of nucleotide substitutions in DNA sequences of L. minor clones directly affected by LF EMR in comparison to indirectly affected clones was revealed at the introns of APx, GPx, and Cat genes starting from the 10th week of the experiment. The results indicate that even low-dose chronic electromagnetic radiation may contribute to the changes in growth parameters and generation of point mutations in antioxidant gene sequences, especially in the intron regions.",

Rangelander on embryogenic suspension growth, embryo production, development, and ability to germinate and convert were studied. Application of SA and AVG alone or together at concentrations from 1 to 500 μM in B5g liquid medium during the proliferation phase had an inhibitory effect on ethylene production and embryogenic suspension growth. Additionally, it caused a drastic reduction in production of embryos and their development on BOi2Y solid differentiation medium. The inhibitory effect of SA was more visible than that of AVG. In addition, disturbance of ethylene biosynthesis during the proliferation phase of SE resulted in diminished lateral germination and conversion of cotyledonary embryos on MS solid medium. Moreover, blocking of ethylene receptors by 1-MCP during the proliferation phase also inhibited ethylene production and embryogenic suspension growth and reduced embryo production during differentiation. MCP almost completely inhibited development of cotyledonary embryos. At the same time, development of more embryos was arrested at the globular stage, and the number of abnormal embryos almost doubled. Similarly, addition of 1-MCP or NBD to the ambient atmosphere during the differentiation phase evidently arrested the development of embryos and, consequently, their ability to germinate and convert on MS regeneration medium. All the results presented above demonstrated that not only ethylene biosynthesis, but also ethylene action is involved in the control of individual phases of SE in Medicago sativa L. cv. Rangelander. And what is more, disturbance of these processes during distinct phases of SE adversely affects vigor of the somatic embryos obtained.",

    "abstract": "Storage lipid and protein breakdown in germinating seeds of yellow (Lupinus luteus L.), white (L. albus L.), and Andean lupine (L. mutabilis Sweet) and regulatory function of sucrose were investigated. Less oil bodies were detected in organs of yellow lupine seeds, whereas the highest content of oil bodies was noticed in the Andean lupine seeds. Mature, air-dried yellow, white and Andean lupine seeds do not contain starch. Starch grains appear the earliest in white lupine seeds during imbibition. Sucrose deficiency in tissues enhances breakdown of storage lipid, protein and temporary starch in cotyledons. In sucrose starved embryo axes of all investigated lupine species, an increased level of vacuolization was noted. Interconnections between catabolism of storage protein and storage lipid in germinating lupine seeds were identified by applying 14C-acetate. To assess the importance of key processes in storage lipid breakdown NaF (inhibitor of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis), KCN, NaN3 and SHAM (inhibitors of mitochondrial electron transport chain) and MSO (inhibitor of glutamine synthetase) were used. Radioactivity coming from 14C-acetate was released as 14CO2 but mostly was incorporated into ethanol-soluble fraction of embryo axes and cotyledons. Respiratory inhibitors caused a significant decrease in 14CO2 and ethanol fractions in all three lupine species studied. MSO stimulated release of 14CO2 and radioactivity of ethanol fractions in yellow lupine organs fed with sucrose, but in Andean lupine MSO enhanced the production of 14CO2 and radioactivity of ethanol fractions both in organs fed and not fed with sucrose. Different strategies of storage compound breakdown are proposed, depending on relative proportion in storage protein and lipid content in lupine seeds.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of four new forms of MCPA being the herbicidal ionic liquids (HILs) with MCPA as an anion and two previously known formulations (potassium–sodium salt and 2-ethylhexyl ester) on seed germination and seedling development of winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus). Rape plants are susceptible to MCPA and volunteers can be a big problem in crop rotation. Seedling fresh weight and root length were quantified, mitotic activity, as well as lipid, starch, hydrogen peroxide and polyphenol contents were assessed by light and fluorescence microscopy and the computer-aided cytophotometer. In primary roots mitotic activity was almost completely inhibited under the influence of herbicides, cell elongation zones and root hair zones were significantly reduced, and a characteristic bolded root segment formed just above a meristem. In contrast to the traditional salt formulation the new HILs were weak inducers of hydrogen peroxide synthesis, but were potent stimulators of the synthesis of phenolic compounds and storage as well as emergency substances such as lipids and starch. All tested forms of MCPA caused strong phytotoxic effect on winter rape seedlings, but the tested HILs were more effective.",

After 14 days, rhizosphere and leaf samples were analysed. Salix plants were able to release relatively high amounts of low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOAs) in a short period of time. The total amount of LMWOAs increased with increasing Cu concentrations. Oxalic and acetic acids were dominant, and act as complexing agents for Cu ions, and therefore, organic exudates should be taken into account in phytoextraction of polluted areas. The Ca/Mg ratio of the medium significantly influenced not only concentration, but also the composition of LMWOAs. Phenolics content in leaves increased with the excess of Ca and Mg and with Cu level in the medium for all Ca/Mg ratios. The accumulation of glucose, fructose and sucrose in leaves was observed for deficiency and excess of Ca and/or Mg and Cu treatment at all Ca/Mg ratios. Excess calcium (Ca/Mg = 20:1) led to strong induction of salicylic acid biosynthesis, probably resulting from enhanced oxidative stress.",

Taxanes are one of the most effective anticancer drugs. This study was undertaken to describe the levels and patterns of taxane variation in the Sudetian region (SW Poland). Paclitaxel (T) and 10-deacetylbaccatin III (10-DAB) concentrations were analysed in five populations. Needles and twigs were analysed from 60 individuals (30 males and 30 females) in each population. In addition, morphometric measurements were taken in the populations to obtain light intensity coefficients (specific leaf area, SLA). High variability in the taxane contents at both intra and interpopulational levels was found. Nevertheless, females had a significantly higher taxane content compared to males. Because taxanes are carbon-based secondary metabolites, females have higher rate of gas exchange of females compared to males. This was probably an adaptation to greater reproductive effort incurred by females. In this regard, female individuals seem to be better for selecting elite cultivars with a higher taxane production. The relationship between light intensity and taxane content was not significant. Shading, important for optimizing crop production, should not reduce the concentration of taxanes.",

Spray applications of AgNO3 on 30 days’ old female plants induced hermaphrodite flowers. Male plants were insensitive to the AgNO3 sprays. Application of 500 mg/l AgNO3 on female plants produced the maximum proportion of induced hermaphrodite flowers. Hermaphrodite flowers appeared 17–21 days after AgNO3 spray and continued up to 8–17 days, depending upon the concentration of AgNO3. Pollen grain viability of induced hermaphrodite flowers (93.5%) was similar to pollen grain viability of normal male (95.0%) flowers. Because of higher fruit weight, progenies from female homosexual cross recorded higher yield. The hybrids from such crosses produced only female plants while the hybrids between female and normal male segregated into male and female in an equal proportion, indicating that sex in sweet gourd is controlled by a single factor, male being heterozygous and female being homozygous recessive. Through this technique, elite characters of female genotypes could be combined into a single plant.",

After-ripening florets at 25 °C for 12 weeks completely removed dormancy. Caryopses (florets without lemma and palea) were able to germinate totally at 20 °C. Karrikinolide (KAR1) and gibberellic acid (GA3) applied at 10–25 °C partially or markedly induced germination of dormant florets and caryopses, respectively. Both florets and caryopses were more sensitive to KAR1 than to GA3. To obtain similar effects, 1,000 to 10,000 times lower concentrations of KAR1 than GA3 were required. After-ripening with time gradually increased sensitivity of caryopses to these regulators. Likewise, after-ripened, non-dormant caryopses were sensitive to KAR1 and GA3. Inhibitors of gibberellin biosynthesis, ancymidol, paclobutrazol and flurprimidol inhibited the effect of KAR1. This inhibition was reversed by GA3. Caryopses pre-incubated in water with ancymidol or paclobutrazol in the presence or absence of KAR1 germinated completely but with different rates after transfer to GA3. KAR1 probably requires gibberellin biosynthesis to stimulate germination of dormant Avena fatua L. caryopses. Both KAR1 and GA3 increased α-amylase, β-amylase and dehydrogenases activities during imbibition before visible germination occurred.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this research was to study the physiological and biochemical responses of pelargonium growing in saline substrate. Salt stress caused an increase of sodium and chlorine, and decrease potassium ions concentrations in pelargonium leaves depending on their level in peat substrate. About 4–16-fold increase of sodium, 4–6-fold increase of chlorine were found in leaves of plants growing in substrate treated with the lowest (452 mg dm−3) and highest (2992 mg dm−3) NaCl doses, respectively. The concentration of potassium ions decreased by 20 to 27 % in leaves of plants growing in substrate supplemented with NaCl doses from 1976 to 2992 mg dm−3, respectively. However, lower doses of sodium chloride did not affect the content of potassium ions in pelargonium leaves. The increasing salinity of substrate after the addition of 960–2992 mg NaCl dm−3 caused the reduction of plant fresh matter in the range of 25–65 %, plant height 10–37 %, and leaf area 15–55 %. There were no changes in relative water content (RWC) and no signs of damage in the form of necrotic spots for any of the used salt concentrations. The content of chlorophyll pigments decreased proportionally to salt concentration, but the content of carotenoids did not change. Maximum photochemical activity of PSII (F v/F m) was reduced only in plants growing at the highest dose of NaCl. Proline and anthocyanin levels increased in response to elevated NaCl concentration. At the highest dose of NaCl proline level increased by 30 % while the content of anthocyanins increased about 2.5-fold in relation to the control. It can be assumed that proline and anthocyanins accumulated in pelargonium leaves may be responsible for the amelioration of the adverse effects of salt stress. The results revealed that the investigated pelargonium 'Survivor Dark Red' is somewhat tolerant to salinity and it can be cultivated in substrate and soil polluted with NaCl at the level lower than 1976 mg dm−3.",

    "abstract": "Proteolysis is considered as a crucial factor determining the proper development of the plant and its efficient functioning in variable environmental conditions. The role of proteases in protein quality control and protein turnover processes is well documented. The results of studies performed in recent years reveal; however, that proteolytic enzymes also participate in signal transduction pathways by releasing membrane-anchored transcription factors in the process known as regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP). The first described intramembrane protease was identified in human cells in 1997. In turn, the first plant intramembrane protease was identified in 2005, in Arabidopsis thaliana. To date, most studies concerning the RIP process in plants have been performed on this model plant. The knowledge concerning the potential physiological role of RIP is very limited. However, continuously accumulating information concerning this issue indicates that RIP, like the other proteolytic mechanisms, has a significant effect on plant ontogenesis, acclimatization and fertility. The aim of this article is to gather and systemize the present knowledge concerning the intramembrane proteases in A. thaliana.",

Micro-Tom ABA-deficient mutants (sitiens—MTsit) and its wild type (MTwt) were characterized by continuous monitoring of electrical activity for 66 h and by application of an electrical stimulation supplied extracellularly. MTsit generated SAPs which spread along the stem, including petioles and roots with an amplitude of 44.6 ± 4.4 mV, half-time (t½) of 33.1 ± 2.9 s and velocity of 5.4 ± 1.0 cm min−1. Amplitude and velocity were 43 and 108 % higher in MTsit than in MTwt, respectively. The largest number of SAPs was registered in the early morning in both genotypes. MTsit was less responsive to electrical stimuli. The excitation threshold and the refractory period were greater in MTsit than in MTwt. After current application, APs were generated in the MTwt with 21.2 ± 2.4 mV amplitude and propagated with 5.6 ± 0.5 cm min−1 velocity. Lower intensity stimuli did not trigger APs in these plants. In MTsit APs were measured with amplitude of 26.8 ± 4.8 mV and propagated with velocity of 8.5 ± 0.1 cm min−1.",

    "abstract": "As an essential regulatory component in plants, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been intensively studied over the past decade. Although hundreds of miRNAs have been identified and analyzed in many important crops and model plants, very little is known about the function of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) miRNAs. In this study, we performed computational prediction of novel wheat miRNAs based on BLAST searches of the expressed sequence tag database. The expression profiles of all miRNAs were performed for both vegetative and reproductive tissues to identify developmentally regulated miRNAs. A total of 19 new miRNAs belonging to 12 MIR families were identified using stringent criteria for miRNA annotation. For all of the miRNAs, the secondary structures of their precursor sequences were predicted. Two pairs of distinct miRNAs were found to be located on the same precursor. The predicted miRNAs were experimentally verified by a stem-loop qRT-PCR-based assay. The expression profiles were performed in both vegetative and reproductive tissues to find the potential correlations between the developmental phase and miRNA activity. Thirteen out of 19 miRNAs were upregulated at certain phases of plant development, and three of them (miR319, miR395, and miR171) showed the greatest expression in young spikes during microsporogenesis. Our results provide useful information for future studies of miRNA-mediated regulation of flower and grain development in wheat.",

An HPLC/DAD analysis revealed the presence of numerous hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, including chlorogenic acid (5-O-CQA, 0.1 % dry weight) and 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (3,5-DCQA, 0.3 % dry weight), which were among major constituents of the examined extract. Application of a hyphenated chromatographic method—UHPLC/DAD/MSn—allowed identification of sixteen compounds, derivatives of caffeic acid. Apart from the compounds commonly found in Inula sp., the plant material contained eight conjugates of caffeic acid with aldaric acid. The aldarates constituted over 50 % of the hydroxycinnamate fraction in the examined tissue. This is the first report on the occurrence of the caffeoylaldaric acids in Inula sp. and in a plant tissue culture.",

    "abstract": "Until recently it was believed that cyanobacterial pathway of plastoquinone biosynthesis is analogical to that of higher plants. In plants, homogentisate is a precursor of the hydrophilic head group of plastoquinone. Recent experiments on Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 have shown that this organism takes advantage of another pathway that resembles ubiquinone biosynthetic pathway of α-, β- and γ-proteobacteria. In the present work, we have analysed the content of plastoquinone, tocopherol and tocopherolquinone in six strains of cyanobacteria and compared the obtained results with search for genes of homologues of enzymes participating in tocopherol and ubiquinone biosynthesis. We have shown that inhibition of homogentisate synthesis lowers tocopherol content but does not affect plastoquinone synthesis in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. Inhibitors of p-hydroxybenzoate and homogentisate prenyltransferases selectively influenced plastoquinone and tocopherol biosynthesis in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Radiolabelled 14C-p-hydroxybenzoate was incorporated into plastoquinone by three cyanobacteria species investigated. Although, when 14C-homogentisate was added to growth medium, the labelled plastoquinone was found in extracts of the cyanobacteria. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 grown in the presence of 14C-homogentisate showed also small amounts of the labelled tyrosine, suggesting that cyanobacteria are able to incorporate exogenously added homogentisate into shikimate pathway.",

    "abstract": "Effect of Cu (0.1, 1, 10, and 100 μM) on the regeneration of carrot (Daucus carota L.) androgenic embryos of var. Feria and 1014 breeding line as well as on polyamines (PAs), proline contents, lipid peroxidation and Cu accumulation after 16 and 24 weeks was studied. Generally, growth of Feria rosettes was better than that of the 1014 line. Significant increase in Cu content in tissues was observed in both cultures grown at the highest Cu concentration (100 μM). The dose-dependent increase in proline in the 16-week-old culture of Feria was observed, while in 1014 its level increased only at the highest applied Cu concentration. On the contrary, in the 24-week-old culture, significant increase in the proline content were observed at 100 and 10 μM Cu in Feria and in 1014 breeding lines, respectively. The decline in proline content and decrease in embryogenic ability in the line 1014 grown in the presence of the highest Cu concentration for 24 weeks may indicate that a certain threshold of intracellular Cu was crossed. Both in Feria and 1014 line, putrescine and spermidine were the most abundant free PAs. The increased content of proline and higher contents of the constitutive free putrescine and spermidine in Feria cultivated for 24 weeks at the highest Cu concentration point to better protection of this cultivar. Thus, it seems that the higher tolerance of Feria to oxidative stress (characterized by lower thiobarbituric acid reactive substances value) may result from higher constitutive level of PAs. These data confirm the suggestion that variations in PA levels depend not only on the concentrations of metals tested, but also on plant species and cultivars. The role of PAs and proline in the carrot cultures treated with Cu is discussed.",

    "abstract": "According to regular reports, one of the most serious diseases of winter cereal and grass varieties in moderate and cold climatic areas is pink snow mould caused by Microdochium nivale. Currently, the resistance of the economically important cereal species as triticale is not satisfactory. Moreover, there is no efficient strategy of protection against this pathogen and the understanding of plant resistance mechanisms is rather poor. Presented paper for the first time shows the cytological analysis of M. nivale infection in model triticale varieties by the use of fluorescent and light microscopy in combination with fluorescent dyes and hydrogen peroxide staining. Both, the infection level and the dynamic of the process varied for tested genotypes confirming the field and laboratory data of their different resistance to this pathogen. Moreover, our analysis showed that in both cultivars cold-hardening of seedlings delayed the mycelium growth. In both cultivars, hyphal walls and fungal penetration sites were visualized in crowns, leaf sheaths and leaves of hardened and non-hardened inoculated seedlings. For the first time the presence of the haustoria produced by M. nivale was confirmed in those tissues. Single infection hyphae usually penetrated into the host tissues via stomatal apparatuses were accompanied by the efflux of hydrogen peroxide. The data show a great potential of fluorescence techniques in studying the host plant–pathogen interactions providing a better insight into plant defence reactions that may allow elaboration of the efficient breeding strategies aimed at increasing resistance to this pathogenic fungus.",

Lack of sucrose in the medium caused significant increase in total lipid content in yellow, white and Andean lupine isolated embryo axes but in Andean lupine seedling cotyledons and excised cotyledons, lipid level was clearly lower in carbohydrates deficient conditions. Sucrose caused no significant effect on fatty acids spectra. The main fatty acid in yellow lupine seeds was linoleic acid, in white lupine oleic acid and in Andean lupine both oleic and linoleic acids. The main phospholipid in organs of three lupine species was phosphatidylcholine. In sugar-deficient conditions, content of phosphatidylcholine and some others phospholipids was decreased. The peculiar features of regulation by sugars of storage lipid breakdown in germinating lupine seeds and induction of autophagy in young carbohydrate starved embryo axes is discussed.",

    "abstract": "The effect of phosphate starvation on growth and acid phosphatases (APases) localization and activity in oat tissues was investigated. Oat cultivars (Avena sativa L.—Arab, Polar, Szakal) were grown for 1–3 weeks in complete nutrient medium (+P) and without phosphate (−P). Pi concentration in plant tissues decreased strongly after culturing on −P medium. Pi deficit reduced shoot growth, stimulated root elongation and increased ratio of root/shoot in all oat cultivars. Pi deficit had a greater impact on growth of oat cv. Polar than other varieties. A decrease in the internal Pi status led to an increase of acid phosphatase activities in extracts from shoots and roots, and in root exudates. The highest activity of secreted APases was observed for oat cv. Arab, during the third week of growth under Pi-deficient conditions. The activity of extracellular APase was high in young, growing zones of roots of −P plants. Histochemical visualization indicated high activity of APases in the epidermis and vascular tissues of −P plants. Pi deficiency increased intracellular APase activity in shoot mainly in oat cv. Polar, whereas APase activity in roots was the highest in oat cv. Szakal. Protein extracts from roots and shoots were run on native discontinuous PAGE to determine which isoform(s) may be affected by Pi deficiency. Three major APase isoforms were detected in all oat plants; one was strongly induced by Pi deficit. The studied oat cultivars differed in terms of acclimation to deficiency of phosphate—used various pools of APases to acquire Pi from external or internal sources.",

    "abstract": "In higher plants, glutamine synthetase (GS; EC 6.3.1.2) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH; EC 1.4.1.2) are the predominant enzymes in nitrogen metabolism. In this study, we cloned both the GS and GDH genes and analyzed their expression levels and variations in their activity in developing and germinating x Triticosecale (cv. Witon) kernels. The developing kernel samples were collected 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 and 45 days after flowering (DAF). The germinating kernel samples were collected after 8, 16, 24, 48 and 72 h of imbibition. There are two GS isoforms that are localized to different compartments: the cytosol (GS1) and the chloroplast (GS2). Five cDNAs encoding GS proteins in triticale plants were obtained using RT-PCR. We cloned the four genes encoding GS1, which we designated TsGS1-1, TsGS1-2, TsGS1-3 and TsGS1-4 and the only gene encoding GS2, which was designated TsGS2-1. We studied the changes in the enzymatic activity and the expression profiles of the GDH, GS1 and GS2 genes in both the developing and germinating seeds of triticale. Based on our results, there is likely cooperation between GDH and GS1 in the synthesis of glutamine and glutamate during the early stages of seed formation and in the scutella of kernels for up to 24 h of imbibition.",

The objective of this investigation was to increase the effectiveness of Avena sativa L. haploid embryo germination obtained by the distant crosses with maize. Developed embryos (obtained from 22 genotypes) were transferred on five germination media: MS (Murashige and Skoog, Physiol Plant 15:473–497, 1962) with 3% sucrose, pH 5.8 (control medium), and 190-2 supplemented with 6 and 9% maltose. The pH of 190-2 was adjusted to 5.5 and 6.0. Of all tested genotypes, 591 haploid embryos were obtained, almost half of them (279) germinated. The rate of haploid embryo germination induced on 190-2 was 6.92%, while in MS it was 3.25%. The sugar and its concentration significantly affected the germination of haploid embryos. The highest percentage of haploid embryo germination (9.11%) and DH lines production (1.64%) was achieved on 190-2 with 9% maltose and pH 6.0. All DH lines are incorporated to breeding programs for the development of new cultivars.",

    "abstract": "An insect–plant interaction induced gall formation is where gall wasps change the plant development towards formation of new units to shield and nourish the evolving larvae. The targets of the insect signals and the mechanism of gall development are unknown. To show the molecular pathways that are responsive to the gall wasp, the proteomic approach was used to compare the gall with non-gall plant tissues. We studied three oak gall species (Cynips quercusfolii, Cynips longiventris, and Neuroterus quercusbaccarum) and the host plant (Quercus robur). Among the 21 identified proteins, 18 increased and three decreased in abundance in gall tissue, in comparison to the leaf tissues. Ten proteins were C. quercusfolii responsive, two only with this gall inducer, while seven increased in abundance. Eleven proteins were C. longiventris responsive, and two only with this gall inducer. Sixteen proteins were associated with gall formation by the N. quercusbaccarum and, in this, eight only with this gall inducer. A similar effect on protein abundance occurred as galls in leaf veins (for five proteins). For leaf blades, such a relation was not found. The role of each protein is discussed according to its involvement in the gall formation. Moreover, S-adenosyl methionine synthase, flavone 3-hydroxylase, stress- and pathogenesis-related proteins, and gamma carbonic anhydrase are associated with developmental regulation of plant tissue into a gall.",

The cultures were grown on ten variants of Murashige–Skoog medium variants enriched with various concentrations of growth regulators (GRs), BA and NAA, in the concentration range 0.1–3.0 mg/L. The analysed extracts were confirmed to contain from four to six compounds (depsides—chlorogenic acid, neochlorogenic acid, and rosmarinic acid, and also protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid). The total amounts of the metabolites varied considerably, depending on the amounts of the GRs in the tested medium variants, and increased in the callus and shoot extracts, respectively, up to 1.7 and 3.2 times (A. arbutifolia), and 2.2 and 2.7 times (A. × prunifolia). Maximum total amounts were confirmed in shoot extracts of both plants (approx. 200 and 600 mg/100 g DW, respectively). The main compounds in A. arbutifolia cultures were the depsides—chlorogenic acid, rosmarinic acid, and neochlorogenic acid (max. 91.94, 77.03, 32.57 mg/100 g DW, respectively). The same depsides dominated quantitatively in the cultures of A. × prunifolia (max. 131.82, 206.62 and 257.39 mg/100 g DW, respectively).",

    "abstract": "This article presents changes in concentrations of d-pinitol (and other cyclitols as well as low molecular weight carbohydrates) in vegetative and reproductive organs of fenugreek (Trigonella foenumgraecum L.) during an entire plant growing period. d-Pinitol was the major cyclitol in all tested organs, representing 43–94% of total cyclitols and 2–77% of total soluble carbohydrates. The highest concentration of d-pinitol was found in pods (14–23 mg g−1 of dry weight, DW), lower in leaves and stems (5–20 and 9–10 mg g−1 DW, respectively), and the lowest in maturing seeds (2–5 mg g−1 DW). Although maturing seeds accumulate α-d-galactosides of d-pinitol (galactosyl pinitols, up to 6.6 mg g−1 DW), the major storage sugars were raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs, 65.37 mg g−1 DW). Both RFOs and galactosyl pinitols are hydrolyzed during seed germination, releasing sucrose and d-pinitol, respectively. Accumulation of free galactose was not detected. Owing to the high concentration of d-pinitol (up to 23.70 mg g−1 DW) and low concentration of soluble sugars, developing pods seem to be the best source of d-pinitol.",

    "abstract": "Moderate heat stress may provide protection against a subsequent severe high temperature stress in plants. However, the exact mechanisms of heat acclimation of wheat are still poorly understood. In the present work, two wheat varieties Ellvis and Soissons were exposed to a moderate elevated temperature at 30 °C, and the changes of certain protective mechanisms were investigated. Although the differences in the proline level between the genotypes were not substantial, it was approx. 2–3 times higher in the heat-treated plants than in the controls. After exposure to moderate elevated temperature, the activities of ascorbate peroxidase and catalase were also induced. Similarly, the amount of the free salicylic acid also increased after moderate heat stress, independently on the genotypes. The amount of the main polyamines, namely, putrescine, spermidine, and spermine either did not change or decreased after the same period. However, heat acclimation increased the level of 1,3-diaminopropane, in parallel with a polyamine oxidase gene, TaPAO. While the expression level of the peroxisomal polyamine oxidase gene TaperPAO hardly changed, TaPAO showed a substantial increase after 1 day, especially in Soissons, and at the end of the heat treatment was still significantly higher than in the controls. These suggest that signalling processes related to polyamine metabolisms or salicylic acid-related processes might also contribute to the higher heat tolerance induced by moderate heat stress. The variations in recorded measurements were mainly temperature dependent, and the effect of genotype was less pronounced than the effect of moderate heat treatment itself.",

Studies have shown that HD-Zip transcription factor has four subfamilies (subfamilies I–IV), and each subfamily exerts similar or diverse functions in the growth and development as well as environmental stress responses of plants. Although a genome-wide analysis of this transcription factor has been performed in some species, systematic identification of sequences and expression patterns under biotic and abiotic stress have not been carried out in pear. In this study, we identified 52 putative HD-Zip genes within the pear genome. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, HD-Zip transcription factors were classified into four subfamilies: 18, 13, 5, and 16 members were identified separately in subfamilies I, II, III, and IV, respectively. Genes in the same subfamily shared the constituent structure and conserved motifs, thereby implying that the HD-Zip genes that shared similar structures may exert similar functions. Moreover, abundant stress-related and pathogen-related cis-elements were observed in the promoter region of the pear HD-Zip I and II genes. Transcript abundance level of 20 selected HD-Zip I and II genes were analyzed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) during the infection of Alternaria alternata, and abiotic stress conditions such as drought and salinity treatment. The results confirmed that some genes display stress-inducible and pathogen-inducible expression patterns.",

The effect of NO and HCN was inhibited by cPTIO, thus the effect of HCN was NO dependent. Dry storage for 16 weeks could partially release dormancy only at 35 °C, but not at 25 °C. Dry storage increased the response to light, GA3 and ethylene. The response to GA3 and ethylene at 25 °C was enhanced with increasing storage temperature.

We tested the expression of 57 NAC genes in the presence of NaCl in young leaves of two elite rice cultivars, Cotaxtla and Tres Ríos, which display contrasting responses to salinity at the biochemical and physiological levels. Using qRT-PCR, the expression of 41 out of 57 NAC genes was validated, of which 23 showed regulation by NaCl. We identified two NAC genes (Os02g56600 and Os12g07790) induced in Cotaxtla, but repressed in Tres Ríos when plants were exposed to 100 mM NaCl in nutrient solution. In both elite cultivars, treated plants showed higher concentrations of total amino acids and proline in comparison to the controls; in all cases, Cotaxtla plants accumulated more free amino acids and proline than Tres Ríos plants. Furthermore, shoot growth was more affected in both cultivars, while root length was not reduced in treated plants in comparison to the controls. We conclude that both elite rice cultivars exhibit different expression patterns of NAC transcription factors as well as biochemical and physiological responses to salt stress, giving rise to better performance of Cotaxtla plants in comparison to Tres Ríos plants under our experimental conditions.",

Their storage problems can be circumvented only by cryopreserving meristems. This study looked at the morphogenetic response of shoot tips of periclinal chimera chrysanthemum 'Lady Orange' and 'Lady Salmon', as well as the solid mutant 'Richmond', that were cryopreserved by encapsulation-dehydration technique. By applying 10 µM ABA in the preculture medium followed by 4-day-long dehydration treatment, the explant survival reached up to 67%. Besides the stimulation of typical single shoot recovery, cryopreservation led to direct or indirect multiple shoot formation, shoot malformation, as well as inhibited their spontaneous rooting. Microscopic analysis revealed three types of structural damages of shoot tips which can correspond with their morphogenetic response in recovery culture. No influence of cryostorage on the acclimatisation efficiency of the recovered chrysanthemums was observed.",

For comparative purposes, the diaspores of two species of flowering plants growing in the area of Olsztyn (Poland), Poa annua (Poaceae) and Cerastium arvense (Caryophyllaceae) were used. A qualitative and quantitative analysis of soluble carbohydrates conducted by means of high-resolution gas chromatography showed that monosaccharides (glucose and fructose), maltose and sucrose, raffinose, myo-inositol and galactinol are ubiquitous in developing and mature diaspores among investigated species. Moreover, D. antarctica and P. annua caryopses additionally contained stachyose and 1-kestose; the seeds of Caryophyllaceae studied were found to contain d-pinitol and d-ononitol. The development and maturation of the seeds of polar Caryophyllaceae and Poaceae were accompanied by the changes in the concentration of their soluble carbohydrates. During maturation, seeds accumulated galactinol and raffinose family of oligosaccharides (RFOs), except C. quitensis. Although seeds of the studied Caryophyllaceae contained d-pinitol and lower amounts of d-ononitol, they did not accumulate α-d-galactoside derivatives of mentioned cyclitols. P. annua caryopses, occurring in the Antarctic, were found to accumulate considerably higher amounts of sucrose and 1-kestose than those developed in Olsztyn.",

    "abstract": "Classical soil science approaches have enabled us to establish basic principles of how the soil system functions and have answered numerous practical agricultural application questions. In recent years, efforts have been refocused on better understanding, managing and benefiting from this system that contains one of the most complex biological communities of the planet. Soil biology is seen as being at the center of scientific research of this century, with novel research objectives and goals being set. In addition, plant nutrition has enabled us to understand nutrient uptake, transport and mobilization mechanisms in plants, and both disciplines have converged on the area of microorganism-mediated plant nutrition. The challenge for these scientific areas is to identify microorganism communities and the roles they play in their habitats, as well as the mechanisms that plants have to make better use of nutrients. Genomics and metagenomics, along with microbiological techniques, are contributing greatly to advances in our understanding of living systems that exist in the soil and their interaction with plants. For its part, molecular plant nutrition has made significant progress in understanding the use of nutrients by plant cells, and has identified molecular mechanisms that can improve nutrient use efficiency. Together, molecular soil microbiology and molecular plant nutrition are projected to be a driving force in agriculture and sustainable food production in the coming years. Herewith, we aim to integrate recent literature on basic and applied research concerning plant and microbe genomics in terms of their potential for developing a novel molecular plant nutrition approach, with special emphasis on nitrogen, potassium and phosphorous as the major macronutrients for crop plants.",

Essential oil content and composition differed significantly depending on the type of plant material analyzed. Adventitious roots were characterized by the highest essential oil yield, reaching 1.8 % V/DW in Caryopteris × clandonensis. Limonene and cedrol were the main components of the essential oil derived from aerial parts of the intact plants (11.9–16.0 and 10.7–10.9 %, respectively), whereas the volatile fractions of the in vivo roots of all species contained large amounts of 3,5-bis(1,1-dimethyl)-phenol (12.9–26.2 %). 1,8-cineole, absent in the intact plant materials, was the dominating volatile constituent of the essential oils obtained from in vitro shoots (24.8–34.2 %). The volatile oil derived from adventitious root cultures consisted primarily of 1-octen-3-ol (19.7–31.5 %) and medicinally relevant diterpenoids: abietatriene and trans-totarol, which were accumulated in considerable quantities, especially in the adventitious roots of C. clandonensis (21.6 and 29.2 %, respectively).",

The species easily propagates vegetatively, but it also produces large amounts of wind-disseminated achenes that contribute to the colonization of new areas. A sound knowledge of the germination biology of goldenrods is required to control the spread of this invasive species. The objective of this study was to investigate selected aspects of germination of giant goldenrod achenes and to determine: the influence of temperature and humidity on seed dormancy and germination, the content of soluble carbohydrates in seeds and the sensitivity of seeds to selected phytohormones. Unlike native weed species of the same family, S. gigantea seeds did not display symptoms of innate dormancy, and high seed vigor was maintained after storage in a wide range of temperatures, in both dry and moist conditions. The physiological mechanisms behind those traits have not yet been fully explored, but they could be associated with the relatively high sucrose-to-hexose ratio in seeds and significant sensitivity to abscisic acid. More extensive research is required to explain the internal causes for the atypical behavior of goldenrod seeds during dry and moist storage, especially in the context of its invasiveness, because the species has a preference for sites located close to river banks.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Moluccella laevis L. ( Lamiaceae ) is an annual ornamental plant, naturally occurring in the areas of Western and Central Asia (Irano-Turanian area). It is a popular ornamental species, but its phytochemical profile remains poorly studied. This study presents the first report on in vitro cultures of M. laevis . The influence of two types of illumination and plant growth regulators (PGRs) supplementation on the morphogenetic response and the content of phenolic compounds were examined. Shoots were cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) solid basal medium. White light or photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) as well as three concentrations of 6-benzylaminopurine (BA) 2, 3 or 4 µM and one of the three auxins: 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) or 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram—PIC) at concentration of 0.5 µM were used for shoot proliferation. The highest number of axillary shoots per explant (3.4) was obtained for shoots grown on MS medium supplemented with 3-µM BA and 0.5-μM NAA under PAR light. However, the effect of PGRs treatment on shoot growth and development was stronger than the influence of light. The phytochemical analysis using Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry allowed identification of four hydroxycinnamic acids (caffeic, ferulic, rosmarinic, chlorogenic) and two cyanidin glycosides (cyanidin 3- O -galactoside, and cyanidin 3- O -malonylglucoside) in shoot clusters and callus tissue.",

Our literature search included all publications on drought stress related to either the biosynthetic context of volatiles, or the ecophysiology and environmental interactions of species via these compounds. In addition, we surveyed publications on practical questions, such as the optimization of cultivation techniques of essential oil bearing plants. Emphasis was placed on theories explaining regularities in the detected symptoms of test plants and discrepancies of other results. Carbon allocation from primarily metabolism to secondary one, competition of parallel terpenoid pathways and the surplus of reductive power are the main theories that are discussed around. During evaluation, the main question was: which principles have already been justified in the biosynthesis/accumulation/emission of plant volatiles due to drought stress? What are the strengths and limitations of the theories? In discussing results from different scientific fields, the intention is to reveal logical connections that are yet to be addressed in the future co-operative multidisciplinary research. The simple question—whether drought stress increases the biosynthesis/accumulation/emission of plant volatiles—is not adequate any more. According to current scientific knowledge, the fine-tuning of all related variables is the challenge of next generation studies, especially for MAP species.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Hairy root cultures are an efficient tool for the biotechnological production of plant metabolites and a convenient experimental model for analyzing the effect of various compounds on plant metabolism. In contrast to many other types of in vitro plant cultures, hairy roots do not require an external supply of phytohormones to the medium. Consequently, plant growth regulators such as auxins and cytokinins are rarely used as elicitors in hairy root in vitro cultures; however, they can strongly influence plant defense responses. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of two auxins: natural indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and synthetic 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), as well as two cytokinins: natural kinetin and synthetic 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) at a concentration of 0.75 mg/L on the metabolism of sterols and triterpenoids in Calendula officinalis hairy roots. Auxins prevented the accumulation of triterpenoid saponins (oleanolic acid glycosides), while cytokinin BAP increased their accumulation by 17% and their release into the culture medium by a factor of 10. Other cytokinins and kinetins increased the sterol levels by 17%, the level of stigmasterol by 15%, and the level of isofucosterol by 7 times.",

The present research demonstrates the participation of plant cell organelles based on ultrastructural examination of compatible and incompatible interactions in tobacco- and potato-potato virus Y (PVY) necrotic strains. In two interaction types, PVYN Wi and PVYNTN particles were documented inside cell nuclei. Virus cytoplasmic inclusions and particles were associated with nuclear envelope pore complexes. Moreover, the PVY capsid protein was immunolocalised in the cell nucleus and nucleolus. Our results for the first time show PVY particles and capsid proteins inside the mitochondrion in compatible interactions, whereas in hypersensitive responses these interactions were identified inside chloroplasts. The PVY particles attached to mitochondria caused association groups of these organelles. The ultrastructural analysis clearly demonstrated both the dynamics of the endoplasmatic reticulum in two types of PVY interactions and connections between PVY cytoplasmic inclusions and particles with its membranous structures. Moreover, we demonstrated strongly localised immunodetection of the PVY capsid protein on the surface and in the vicinity of ER in cases of hypersensitive response as well as in compatible interaction.",

    "abstract": "Drought tolerance in barley is highly correlated with the expression of two genes: Hordeum vulgare aleurone 1 (HVA1) and stress-responsive gene 6 (SRG6). Though their role in the mechanism of drought response in barley has been confirmed in transgenic plants, the regulation pathways of these genes' expression have not been sufficiently studied, especially on the level of whole plants. We used four barley genotypes of different drought tolerance to establish and compare the expression profiles of SRG6 and HVA1 and to associate them with the possible physiological and biochemical signals of water deficit. Both genes studied were expressed to a greater extent in drought tolerant genotypes. The highest level of HVA1 transcript accumulation was observed under conditions where the leaf water potential decreased significantly. In tolerant genotype this signal was partially replaced with abscisic acid (ABA) signal of soil water deficit and the final transcript accumulation was about 14 times lower than in the case of leaf water deficit. In the case of SRG6 the main signal which can triggered the transcript accumulation was ABA but in the case of tolerant genotype the direct effect of leaf water deficit was also observed. Thus, it seems to be possible that in drought tolerant barley genotypes, HVA1 and SRG6, are not only more expressed during drought, but tolerant genotypes may be also more sensitive to various internal signals confirming environmental water deficit. The putative role of hydrogen peroxide as a signal of water deficit in the regulation of both genes expression was not confirmed. The drought-induced expression of both HVA1 and SRG6 was additionally reduced in the light. Because of this powerful complexity, a true understanding of plant response to drought requires further studies integrating gene expression and cell signaling analysis in single organs or tissues with whole plant physiology and long distance signaling.",

In this part, we present the copper accumulation and changes in willow biomass. Concentration of copper in roots, rods, shoots and leaves was analyzed with flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Selected indices characterizing copper accumulation and plant biomass structure were calculated to estimate the potential of willow to remove metal from polluted solution. Our results indicate a general increase of copper accumulation by selected willow organs with increase of copper concentration in modified Knop's medium. Moreover, significant differences in copper phytoextraction between plants under different Ca/Mg ratios were affirmed (1:10 > 4:1 > 20:1 > 1:1/4).",

It corresponded with induction of additional isoform of NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME3). On the contrary, CAM-performing M. crystallinum plants exhibited decrease in malate concentration and decay in its diurnal fluctuations as a reaction to B. cinerea infection. This correlated with significant decrease in activities of NADP-malic enzyme isoforms on the 2nd dpi as well as no fluctuations in their activities on the 9th dpi. Presented results point out to differences between C3 and CAM plants in the direction of changes in primary metabolism providing energy, reducing equivalents and carbon skeletons for defense responses to halt the pathogen growth.",

    "abstract": "Plants growing under natural conditions are exposed to a variety of stresses, which can lead to undesirable changes in the physiological processes and yielding. These changes can be regulated at different levels, resulting in the synthesis of specific proteins which participate in the plant's response to stress. The purpose of this study was to determine changes in the accumulation of proteins in germinating pea (Pisum sativum L.) seeds under optimal and osmotic (short- and long-term) stress conditions as well as recovery following a short-term stress. For identification of the proteins, two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) were employed. Germination in optimal conditions increased the accumulation of several proteins involved in glycolysis, Krebs cycle, synthesis of fatty acids, cell growth, cellular transport and detoxification. Osmotic stress, in turn, depressed the accumulation of proteins involved in glycolysis, synthesis of fatty acids, detoxication, methionine conversions, cellular transport, translation, growth control and of cytoskeletal proteins, but raised the accumulation of enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle as well as proteins participating in signal transduction and protection (chaperones). One protein, 6a-hydroxymaackian-3-O-methyltransferase, which is involved in the synthesis of pisatin, was present only under osmotic stress conditions and recovery. Pisatin is synthesized mainly in response to microbiological infections and under stress conditions, indicating its key role in the acquisition of stress tolerance by plants.",

Some winter oilseed rape varieties (Brassica napus L. var. oleifera 'Bojan', 'Lisek', 'Liclassic') that differ in blackleg resistance have been chosen for the experiment. In all tested cultivars during growth on a medium with a fungal elicitor, a distinct reduction in the length of the stems, the roots and the entire length of the seedlings was observed. However, only in the case of the 'Liclassic' cultivar, fresh and dry weight were reversibly affected during elicitation. The cultivar 'Liclassic', recognized as blackleg mildly resistant, was characterized by the most efficient photosynthetic apparatus under toxin elicitation. The efficient adaptation of photosynthetic apparatus in this cultivar was accompanied by an increase in the content of phenolics, chlorophyll and carotenoids. Only for 'Liclassic', did most of the measured parameters of chlorophyll fluorescence (F v′/F m′, ΦPSII, q P and q N) exhibit a statistically significant correlation with regard to the level of carotenoids. Therefore, in'Liclassic', the observed increase in carotenoid content seems to be a significant biochemical factor which can raise the efficiency of the photosynthetic apparatus under elicitation by Phoma lingam toxins.",

An embryonic radicle protruding the seed coat is the first part of plant which has direct contact with external environment including salt-affected soil. In embryo axes, mitochondria are the main energy producer. To understand better salinity impact on mitochondria functioning, this study was focused on the effect of NaCl stress onto mitochondria proteome. Mitochondria were isolated from yellow lupine (Lupine luteus L. 'Mister') embryo axes cultured in vitro for 12 h with 250 and 500 mM NaCl. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of mitochondrial proteins isolated from NaCl-treated axes demonstrated significant changes in proteins abundances as a response to salinity treatment. Twenty-one spots showing significant changes in protein expression profiles both under 250 and 500 mM NaCl treatment were selected for tandem mass spectrometry identification. This approach revealed proteins associated with different metabolic processes that represent enzymes of tricarboxylic acid cycle, mitochondrial electron transport chain, enzymes and proteins involved in mitochondria biogenesis and stresses response. Among proteins involved in mitochondria biogenesis, mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase, subunit Tim17/22, mitochondrial-processing peptidase subunit alpha-1, mitochondrial elongation factor Tu and chaperonins CPN60 were revealed. Finally, formate dehydrogenase 1 was found to accumulate in lupine embryo axes mitochondria under salinity. The functions of identified proteins are discussed in relation to salinity stress response, including salinity-induced PCD.",

Proteomic analyses of plant responses to stressors could lead to the introduction of crops with high resistance to osmotic stress. Such plants would be characterized by high yield even under unfavorable environmental conditions. In this article we describe changes in the protein profiles occurring in response to mild and moderate osmotic stress in triticale roots. Analysis of the protein profiles of these roots showed an increased abundance of 14 and a decreased abundance of 11 proteins under mild osmotic stress conditions while a moderate osmotic stress caused an increased abundance of 18 and a decreased abundance of 33 proteins. Twenty-five proteins, whose quantity altered under stress were identified using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The identified proteins were classified into the categories of proteins associated with: defense mechanisms, metabolism, transcription, cell structure, protein synthesis, transport and signal transduction. The functions of identified proteins were discussed in relation to osmotic stress. Some of the identified proteins may be responsible for the adaptation of plants to adverse conditions.",

The caryopses were germinated in darkness at 20 °C, according to one of the three experimental setups: (a) in distilled water for 24 h, followed by 100 mM NaCl for another 24 h (salinity stress, SS); (b) in 100 µM abscisic acid for 24 h, with rinsing in distilled water to remove residual ABA, followed by 100 mM NaCl for another 24 h (pretreatment with ABA + salinity stress, ABAS); and (c) only in distilled water, for comparison with the tested samples (control, C). After 48 h, proteomes were extracted from barley sprouts in each treatment, according to the method by Gallardo et al. (2002a, b, modified). Proteins were then separated by 2DE and analyzed by MALDI–TOF/MS (Bruker). Under salinity stress, we observed changes in the pattern of proteins involved in: (a) energy metabolism, (b) one-carbon metabolism, (c) cell wall biogenesis, lignification, and adhesion, (d) response to oxidative stress, desiccation stress, and other defense responses, (e) structure and organization of the cytoskeleton, (f) signal transduction, transcription and translation processing, and (g) protein turnover. Our results revealed that ABA can alter the response of barley seedlings to salinity stress. In general, ABA pretreatment limited stress-induced proteomic changes. Alterations in energy and one-carbon metabolism indicate the importance of ABA in glycolytic/gluconeogenic pathways and the SMM cycle during salinity stress. Other observations demonstrated the role of ABA in hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin biosynthesis, ROS scavenging, actin CK formation, control of PI signaling, chromatin-mediated mechanism of stress tolerance, mRNA stability, and protection against dehydration.",

    "abstract": "The phytotoxic abilities of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), in a population consisting of wild species, potato diploid hybrids and potato cultivars, against mustard (Sinapis alba L.) were investigated. Measurements of total glycoalkaloid, phenolic and flavonoid concentrations in potato leaf extracts and their role in phytotoxicity were performed. Extracts prepared from wild potato species, particularly Solanum maglia and Solanum chacoense, had the strongest inhibitory effect on mustard growth. Most extracts significantly extended the germination time, as determined by Piepper's index, but extracts prepared from potato cultivars did not affect seedling growth/development. However, only S. maglia and S. chacoense prolonged the time of germination, corresponding to inhibition of mustard growth. The Pearson's correlation coefficient of concentrations of total glycoalkaloids, phenolics and flavonoids in potato leaf extracts and length of mustard seedlings showed a significant negative correlation for glycoalkaloids (r = − 0.51), with the strongest effect for root length of potato wild species (r = − 0.79) and potato diploid hybrids (r = − 0.86). Our data indicated that glycoalkaloids are the major phytotoxic compounds responsible for potato phytotoxicity against mustard. However, we observed phenolics and flavonoids may influence the strength of the phytotoxic effects caused by glycoalkaloids.",

Sucrose stimulated growth of yellow, white and Andean lupine isolated embryo axes and cotyledons but growth of seedlings was inhibited. Dry matter content was higher in sucrose-fed isolated organs and in seedling organs. Ultrastructure research revealed that lack of sucrose in the medium caused enhancement in storage protein breakdown. Protein deposits in cotyledons were smaller as well as soluble portion content in all studied organs was lower when there was no sucrose in the medium. In the same conditions, the activity of glutamate dehydrogenase was significantly higher. Increase in vacuolization of cells of white lupine root meristematic zone cells was observed and induction of autophagy in young carbohydrate-starved embryo axes is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Sirtuins are proteins belonging to the group of NADH-dependent deacetylase and mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase enzymes. Sirtuins have been discovered for the first time in yeasts, subsequent studies have shown their presence in bacteria, plants and animals. These enzymes are frequently called longevity enzymes due to the fact that they are part of genetic apparatus involved in aging control. In animals, sirtuins are key regulators of cell defense in response to stress caused by many metabolic processes; they are also involved in the regulation of cell division, metabolism, gene silencing and genetic material repair as well as apoptosis. Thus far, only several well-known research teams have been studying plant proteins resembling animal sirtuins. Considering the fact how essential functions sirtuins play in other organisms, it is extremely interesting to understand their role in plants, especially that the knowledge about them is still limited. It is believed that the function of sirtuins in Arabidopsis thaliana is associated with mitochondrial energy metabolism. Possibly they may also control the synthesis of auxins or proteins involved in their transport, or they may be responsible for regulating cellular response to auxin action. In rice, sirtuins are necessary for the protection against genomic instability and cell damage that guarantee their growth. They also take part in a defensive response against Pseudomonas syringae. They may also be involved in the ripening of fruits. Moreover, their functions are associated with photosynthetic activity and aging of leaves.",

In the present study, we aimed to verify whether the presence and concentration of free and cell wall-bound phenolic acids are important factors in triticale responses to M. nivale infection. Based on 3 years' testing of triticale tolerance, 2 out of 92 doubled haploid triticale lines derived from 'Hewo' × 'Magnat' F1 hybrid were selected, which are the most tolerant and the most sensitive to M. nivale infection. Plants were grown along with their parents under controlled conditions, pre-hardened and cold-hardened, while non-hardened plants served as the control. Hardened plants were covered with the artificial snow-imitating covers and inoculated with M. nivale mycelium, while the control plants were treated the same way except the infection. The aim of the study was to identify differences in the initial content and composition of phenolics under the influence of applied stresses. Conducted HPLC analysis showed that the most abundant were ferulic, rosmarinic, chlorogenic, sinapic, and trans-cinnamic acids. The contents of most of phenolics depended on genotype and growth conditions. Two cell wall-bound sinapic and trans-cinnamic acids, could be indicated as potentially related to the increased snow mould tolerance of winter triticale seedlings. A correlation between the total phenolic levels with the tolerance was not found; however, the proportion between the total levels of cell wall-bound and free phenolic compounds under low temperature could play a role prior to M. nivale infection.",

The seedlings were treated with a micro and millimolar concentration of lithium chloride (LiCl) both persistently in a hydroponic medium and acutely through Li+ injection. The length of hypocotyls, fresh weight of seedlings, intensity and period of circumnutation, and the number of action potentials (APs) after glutamate (Glu) injection were determined. It was found that the circumnutation intensity and period did not depend on hypocotyl length and fresh weight of seedlings. Under persistent Li+ treatment, the circumnutation intensity was constant at a concentration between 0.2 and 20 mM although the hypocotyls were significantly shorter in relation to the control, whereas at a concentration of 40 mM circumnutation intensity decreased without any changes in the hypocotyl length. Under persistent treatment with 0.5 and 20 mM Li+, the period of circumnutation was significantly prolonged. The number of APs in a Glu-induced series significantly increased in the seedlings exhibiting an Li+-induced decrease in circumnutation intensity (in 40 and 60 mM Li+). Additionally Li+ injection before Glu injection also augmented the series of APs in seedlings growing without Li+ in hydroponic medium. These Li+-sensitive responses demonstrated that circumnutation and growth are partly independent processes and reveal a relationship between circumnutation intensity and excitability in Helianthus annuus seedlings.",

    "abstract": "Intercellular transport in C4 plant, including maize, is particularly important due to the necessity of efficient exchange of photoassimilates between different types of cells, where specific stages of C4 photosynthesis occur. The transport on the trail: mesophyll—bundle sheath—vascular parenchyma occurs by symplast, through plasmodesmata. The next stage, phloem loading (the transport of photosynthetic products to the companion cell/sieve element complex) belongs to the apoplasmic type, without the participation of plasmodesmata. This work concerns verification of the hypothesis about the impact of low temperature on changes in expression of genes, strictly related to phloem loading process as well as intercellular (symplasmic) transport. For that purpose, in situ hybridization assay for several mRNAs and the determination of changes in the expression level of these transcripts using RT-qPCR technique were conducted. Transcripts related to phloem loading, e.g., sucrose transporters, interactor of proton pump, aquaporins and plasmodesmata-associated genes, coding: TMV-MP30 binding protein and, remorins were selected. Studies were performed on two lines of maize differing in chilling-sensitivity level. Plants were treated with low temperature (day/night): 14/12 and 8/6 °C in two periods: 4 and 28 h. Cold-treatment resulted in a diverse response of tested maize plants, mainly changes in the gene expression under exposition at shock temperature level (6–8 °C) and after prolonged chilling-treatment (28 h). The localization of sucrose transporter and aquaporin transcripts in the thick-walled sieve tubes indicates the potential role of these cells in the phloem loading process. The pronounced changes in expression of plasmodesmata-related transcripts indicate their evident participation in response to cold stress.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Soil drought is a major problem in plant cultivation. This is particularly true for thermophilic plants, such as maize, which grow in areas often affected by precipitation shortage. The problem may be alleviated using plant growth and development stimulators. Therefore, the aim of the study was to analyze the effects of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), zearalenone (ZEN), triacontanol (TRIA) and silicon (Si) on water management and photosynthetic activity of maize under soil drought. The experiments covered three developmental stages: three leaves, stem elongation and heading. The impact of these substances applied during drought stress depended on the plant development stage. 5-ALA affected chlorophyll levels, gas exchange and photochemical activity of PSII. Similar effects were observed for ZEN, which additionally induced stem elongation and limited dehydration. Beneficial effects of TRIA were visible at the stage of three leaves and involved leaf hydration and plant growth. A silicon preparation applied at the same developmental stage triggered similar effects and additionally induced changes in chlorophyll levels. All the stimulators significantly affected transpiration intensity at the heading stage.",

A pot experiment was performed to investigate the response of salt-stressed soybean plants to the foliar application using 50, 100, or 200 mg αT L –1 . The stress was applied by irrigation with three different dilutions of seawater [e.g., EC = 0.23 (tap water as a control), 3.13, or 6.25 dS m –1 ]. The gradual increase in salinity level gradually increased net carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) assimilation, relative growth rate, antioxidant capacity, secondary metabolites (total phenolic compounds, flavonoids, and tannins), enzymatic activities, and DNA fragmentation due to the gradual increase in lipid peroxidation as a result of an increase in hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). On the contrary, yield components (number and weight of seeds plant –1 ) and photosynthetic pigment (total chlorophyll and carotenoids) contents gradually decreased with increasing salinity level. However, leaf treatment with αT, especially at 200 mg αT L ‒1 , preserved the highest antioxidant activities (antioxidant capacity, secondary metabolites, and enzymes), which were associated with the preservation of soybean yield and leaf pigments. These positive results occurred due to the reduction in lipid peroxidation as a result of a significant decrease in the level of H 2 O 2 . Therefore, our results recommend the use of 200 mg αT L –1 as a commercial formula for soybeans grown under saline irrigation of no more than 6.25 dS m –1 .",

Typical of plant type 1 MTs, EhMT1 encodes a putative peptide of 74 amino acid residues containing cysteine-rich domains. Sequence comparisons with various databases revealed strong similarities at the nucleotide and amino acid levels between EhMT1 and the type 1 MT of Mimulus guttatus. EhMT1 transcription was greater in the roots than in the leaves, and was markedly increased by treatments with Cu, H2O2, and heat shock. EhMT1-GUS was localized to the cytoplasm of onion epidermal cells. Escherichia coli cells expressing pET-30a-EhMT1 were more tolerant to Cu and accumulated more Cu than control cells. Our results show that EhMT1 is involved in Cu tolerance and accumulation in E. haichowensis.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this paper has been to investigate the occurrence of health-promoting antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E as well as antioxidative enzymes, e.g. superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase in different parts of the cabbage head (the outer one green leaves, the central leaf layer and the inner layer young, etiolated leaves). Vitamin C content in both the central (209 mg/dm3) and inner (202 mg/dm3) layers of cabbage heads was higher in comparison to the outer one (163 mg/dm3), while vitamin E content (α-tocopherol) in the outer layer (4 μg/g FW) was higher by about 26 and 34% in comparison to the central and inner layers, respectively. The cooperation between vitamins and enzymatic antioxidants led to the highest H2O2 level in the outer layer, while the O 2 ·− level was the highest in the inner part of the cabbage head. We conclude that leaf layers in cabbage heads reflect the different potential of bioactive compounds accumulation, related to the stage of tissue development, as well as tissue-specific stress response.",

The incubation of wheat leaf discs in ZEN solutions strongly inhibited the energy flux per cross section (CS) for absorption (ABS/CS), trapping (TRo/CS) and electron transport (ETo/CS), while the effects of ZEN action on soybean discs were opposite and the values of those parameters significantly increased with the increase in ZEN concentration. Incubation of seeds in a ZEN solution resulted in an increase in photochemical efficiency of PSII in soybean seedlings, but did not induce any response of PSII in those of wheat at medium illuminations. Only at the stronger illumination for both species did ZEN induce an increase in efficiency of excitation energy capture by open PSII reaction centers, photochemical quenching of chlorophyll a fluorescence and quantum yield of PSII electron transport. Pre-sowing soaking of seeds in a ZEN solution decreased the photoinhibitory injuries of PSII in wheat and soybean due to safe scattering of the excess excitation energy through an increase in energy-dependent quenching (qE) and state transition quenching (qT). ZEN when added to NaCl solutions during the period of germination contributed to reduction in the growth inhibition of wheat seedlings. The incubation of wheat leaf discs in ZEN solutions strongly inhibited CS, ABS/CS, TRo/CS and ETo/CS. Possible effects of ZEN on some physiological processes in plants have been discussed especially in the context with photochemical activity of PSII and a salt stress.",

One isoform of glucan, water dikinase named GWD3 or PWD (EC 2.7.9.5) was isolated for the first time from Arabidopsis thaliana, and now we report its isolation and identification in Solanum tuberosum L. leaves and tubers. We compare StGWD3 sequence to the other GWDs sequences using bioinformatics tools and propose also structural models for the starch-binding domains in StGWD3 and StGWD1. The StGWD3 gene expression and protein were localised in different heterotrophic and autotrophic potato tissues and organs using in situ RT-PCR and immunolocalisation methods, respectively. Diurnal changes in the transcript abundance of StGWD3 in leaves were analysed using quantitative real-time PCR and they appeared to be typical for most genes involved in starch degradation in chloroplasts.",

    "abstract": "Hairy root cultures of Crambe abyssinica were obtained through infection of leaves with two wild-type agropine strains of Agrobacterium rhizogenes. The efficiency of transformation was about 16 %. The presence of T-DNA from A. rhizogenes in the hairy roots genome was confirmed by PCR using specific primers for rolB and rolC genes. Selected clones of hairy roots and non-Agrobacterium induced roots from sterile cultures were used for analyses of acyl-lipids. The total amount of acyl-lipids per mg of dry weight was similar in both the non-Agrobacterium induced roots and the hairy roots in good physiological condition, and ranged from 38 to 53 nmol. However, in the clones which showed symptoms of ageing, the lipid content was severely reduced. Also the lipid composition of hairy roots appears to be similar to the composition of non-transformed roots. Polar lipids were the dominant class of lipids in both types of roots (about 75 %). Furthermore, we found diacylglycerols, free fatty acids (FFA), triacylglycerols, sterol esters, and an unidentified lipid class. The dominant fatty acids in the lipids of both types of roots were α-linolenic acid, palmitic acid, and linoleic acid (over 12 % of total FA). Among the lipids of both hairy roots and non-Agrobacterium induced roots of C. abyssinica, an unidentified FA was found (over 16 % of total FAs). The present study is the first example of establishment of hairy roots cultures of C. abyssinica. It also includes the first analysis of the lipids in hairy roots and non-Agrobacterium induced roots of this species.",

    "abstract": "Proteolytic enzymes in wheat leaves were studied using zymographic detection of enzyme activities on one-way (1D) SDS-polyacrylamide gels and two-dimensional (2D) ones, on which protein samples were isoelectrofocused prior to PAGE separation. Gelatin of concentration 0.1 %, copolymerized into SDS-PAGE gels, digested by active proteinases enabled detection of those enzymes. On 1D gels, seven bands were seen and assigned to particular families through the use of specific inhibitors. Metalloproteinases inhibited by 20 mM EDTA were detected as 150 kDa band; aspartic proteinases were assigned to 115–118 kDa double band by using 25 mM pepstatin; 10 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride used for detection of serine proteinases pointed to band of 70 kDa and finally due to 10 μM E-64 inhibitor, cysteine proteinases of 37 and 40 kDa were detected. On 2D gels, additional separation according to protein isoelectric points enabled detection of proteinase isoforms. In the range of 4.5–6 pI, six metalloproteinases as well as ten aspartic proteinases were visible, ten serine- isoforms of pI 4.5–6.8 and four cysteine proteinases of 4.5–5.0 pI were found. Presented results were detected as reproducible results observed at least in four independent biological replications.",

    "abstract": "A pot experiment was designed to demonstrate that the parallel, single-frequency detection of electrical capacitance (CR), impedance phase angle (ΦR), and electrical conductance (GR) in root–substrate systems was an adequate method for monitoring root growth and some aspects of stress response in situ. The wheat cultivars 'Hombar' and 'TC33' were grown in a rhyolite-vermiculite mixture under control, and low, medium, and high alkaline (Na2CO3) conditions with regular measurement of electrical parameters. The photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) and SPAD chlorophyll content were recorded non-intrusively; the green leaf area (GLA), shoot dry mass (SDM), root dry mass (RDM), and root membrane stability index (MSI) were determined after harvest. CR progressively decreased with increasing alkalinity due to impeded root growth. Strong linear CR–RDM relationships (R2 = 0.883–0.940) were obtained for the cultivars. Stress reduced |ΦR|, presumably due to the altered membrane properties and anatomy of the roots, including primarily enhanced lignification. GR was not reduced by alkalinity, implying the increasing symplastic conductivity caused by the higher electrolyte leakage indicated by decreasing root MSI. Fv/Fm, SPAD value, GLA, and SDM showed decreasing trends with increasing alkalinity. Cultivar 'TC33' was comparatively sensitive to high alkalinity, as shown by the greater relative decrease in CR, SDM, and RDM under stress, and by the significantly lower MSI and higher (moderately reduced) |ΦR| compared to the values obtained for 'Hombar'. Electrical root characterization proved to be an efficient non-intrusive technique for studying root growth and stress responses, and for assessing plant stress tolerance in pot experiments.",

    "abstract": "Somatic embryo quality is still a problem for many researchers. To improve the efficiency of germination, special procedures are used, such as partial drying of somatic embryos at high relative humidity or desiccation in the presence of supersaturated solutions of salt. In this work, cotyledonary somatic embryos of Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Serbian spruce (P. omorika) were placed on culture media (ME or BM-5) to germinate. We found that after 4 weeks of incubation on these media, hypocotyl and radicle growth of control (non-dried) somatic embryos of both species was not adequate to yield seedlings able to acclimatize to greenhouse conditions. Therefore, somatic embryos were partly dried at relative humidity of 97 % or desiccated at relative humidity of 79 %, for 2 or 3 weeks, and then placed on the Margara (ME) medium. Partial drying of somatic embryos at the higher relative humidity (97 %) enabled an improvement of radicle growth of germinating somatic embryos in both species. The highest conversion rate (45 %) was obtained for embryos of Norway spruce maintained for 2 weeks at relative humidity of 97 %. This treatment contributed to the improvement of germination and conversion efficiency of somatic embryos of Norway spruce, regardless of the drying period. Improved radicle growth facilitated development of better quality seedlings of this spruce species. In Serbian spruce, we did not obtain seedlings of sufficient quality, due to poor hypocotyl growth. Desiccation at humidity of 79 % for 3 weeks proved to be lethal to somatic embryos of both species.",

We documented that a nocturnal accumulation of citrate preceded that of malate, and that the CAM-dependent increase in citric acid was about 100–times higher than that of malic acid. The induction of CAM was accompanied by an increased activity of cytosolic NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP-ICDH, E.C 1.1.1.42) and by decreased activities of mitochondrial enzymes: fumarase (E.C 4.2.1.2) and NAD-dependent ICDH (E.C 1.1.1.41). Moreover, the activity of citrate synthase (E.C 2.3.3.1) was increased during the nocturnal phase of CAM. Altogether, obtained data suggest that some part of the product of a primary carboxylation (oxaloacetic acid) may pass through the mitochondria at night for reduction and, in form of citrate and isocitrate, may leave the mitochondria to support a daytime decarboxylation.",

Some authors postulated that it is a characteristic feature of C4 plants, although it was reported from C3 species as well. It is unknown whether the occurrence of PR follows a phylogenetic (it is found in clades containing C4 species, regardless of the photosynthetic type) or functional (photosynthetic pathway dependent) pattern. Here, we present a phylogenetically controlled analysis of the occurrence, form and functional aspects of PR in grasses. The occurrence of the PR follows a functional and not a phylogenetic pattern. Its most elaborated form (PR type I) is a unique feature of C4 species. Although PR was found in some of the studied C3 grasses, it was always less developed than PR in the chloroplasts of Kranz mesophyll cells of C4 species. The size of PR in C4 plants was found to increase when the plants were grown under low light intensity. Additional observations, such as a negative correlation between PR size and chloroplast surface and PR occurrence in vicinity of mitochondria or plasmodesmata, suggest that PR may play some role in C4 metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Glyphosate is a systemic, nonselective and most widely used herbicide in the world. The introduction of glyphosate-resistant crops in the mid-1990s resulted in a dramatic increase in the use of glyphosate herbicide making it most widely used herbicide in the world. The average maize yield loss in the field caused by pests is around 20 % but in many regions it is much higher. It is now clear that glyphosate causes broader range of physiological alterations than previously assumed and some plants gain higher level of resistance to glyphosate without the need to use genetic engineering methods. To understand the mechanisms of such heightened resistance we must first know the processes mediating the plants' death in response to glyphosate treatment. Here, we show that 12 miRNAs, belonging to miR167, miR396, miR159, miR156, miR169, miR444 and miR827 families, are significantly upregulated, and one, miR166, downregulated following glyphosate treatment. These miRNAs have been previously shown to be involved in abiotic stress responses and implicated in senescence. Strikingly, two of the induced miRNAs, miR444 and miR827, have been shown to regulate phosphate transport pathways, which seem to be common for Pi and glyphosate uptake.",

    "abstract": "Effects related to the adaptation of wheat to Mn excess were determined by structural and biochemical characterization of chloroplasts obtained from three-leaf seedlings of Mn-treated wheat. Chloroplasts were isolated from two wheat genotypes: sensitive (Raweta) and tolerant (Parabola) cultivated in hydroponic conditions in Hoagland nutrient supplemented with 0 (control), 5, 10, and 20 mmol dm−3 MnSO4. Microscopic observations of the chloroplast structure revealed differences in the size and starch presence between both objects. Changes indicating the stresogenic influence of Mn on Raweta seedlings appeared already at the Mn dose of 10 mmol dm−3, whereas on Parabola, only at 20 mmol dm−3. Biochemical analysis indicated the differences in starch content. Results of measurements of lipid peroxidation, polarity, and electrokinetic potential of chloroplasts point to Mn-stimulated modifications of chloroplast membranes which occurred to be larger for Raweta. The activation of antioxidative enzymes (SOD and POX) shows that ROS are generated under Mn-excess conditions. The content of Mn and Cu, Fe, Mo, and Zn (microelements) as well as Ca, Mg, K, P, and S (macroelements) in chloroplasts was determined by mass (ICP MS) and plasma optic emission (ICP OES) spectrometry. Raweta accumulated greater amount of Mn in comparison with Parabola at all Mn doses in media. Increased concentration of Mn was accompanied with a decrease of uptake other investigated elements (except for K).",

    "abstract": "A putative gene encoding germacrene D synthase (GenBank Accession No. JQ247185) from tea plant (Camellia sinensis) was isolated by rapid amplification of cDNA ends for the first time, which was designated as tea plant gene terpene synthase 1 (Cstps1). This full-length cDNA was 2,090 nucleotides, and the open reading frame was 1,704 bp encoding polypeptides of 568 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence contained two characteristic conserved motifs of RRx8W and DDxxD, which showed high homology with sesquiterpene synthases of angiosperms, and the highest level of similarity was 73 % to germacrene D synthase from Actinidia deliciosa (Accession NO. AAX16121.1). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Cstps1 belonged to the terpene synthase-a subfamily of plant, which was the largest clade of terpene synthases and mainly composed of sesquiterpene synthases. The Cstps1 expression was detected in different organs, with high expression levels in leaf and flower, weak expression in stem and root. Real-time qRT-PCR indicated that Cstps1 could be induced by insect damage, this result suggested Cstps1 might have potential ecological function during tea plant defense response.",

The experiments included five cytokinins [kinetin, 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), 2-isopentenyladenine, and thidiazuron] and two auxins [indole-3-acetic acid and indole-3-butyric acid (IBA)] used in a different concentrations. The results were tested for statistical differences. The highest number of shoot per explant (11.5) was achieved on Murashige and Skoog's (MS) medium supplemented with IBA 0.5 mg/L and BAP 1.0 mg/L, and the optimal rooting response (87.50%) was obtained on MS medium-containing IBA 1.0 mg/L. The rooted plantlets were transferred into the soil and the survival rate was 70.0%. The differences in accumulation of particular alkaloids were revealed depending on PGRs present in harvesting medium. The highest total concentration of alkaloids was determined in the shoot culture grown in the presence of BAP 0.5 mg/L [5.82 mg/g dry weight (DW)]. In routine propagation, MS medium supplemented with IBA 0.5 mg/L and BAP 0.5 mg/L was used as a compromise between the relatively high proliferation rate (~ 8 shoots/explant) and the total content of alkaloids (4.73 mg/g DW). The antimicrobial activity of the biomass and isolated securinine was evaluated towards 12 strains of bacteria and one fungal strain. The differences in bacterial susceptibility against P. glaucus extract and securinine were showed. The MBC values range from 0.01 to 5 mg/mL and from 0.063 to 0.250 mg/mL, respectively, for extract and securinine.",

In this study, the phenomenon of PCD in petals of common lilac (Syringa vulgaris L.) was observed, aimed to compare degradation of petal cells in flowers blooming under natural conditions with those forced in November. For the early lilac forcing, a deep dormancy has to be broken by high temperatures 35–37 °C negatively affecting postharvest life of cut branches. The trials included as well the observation of the effect of two flower preservatives on the PCD in order to see if the prolongation of the lilac vase life was associated with a delay in the onset of the PCD symptoms. The vase life of cut lilacs was significantly increased by both preservatives. The first symptoms of PCD were evident in the flower bud stage. In petals from forced shrubs, the first symptoms of cell degradation were much more advanced than in lilacs blooming naturally in May. In forced flowers held in the preservatives, the degradative changes in cells occurred later than in those kept in water, but they were accelerated relative to a flower developmental stage.",

The CsSCARECROW (CsSCR) gene was previously identified among a panel of genes upregulated after the induction of SE in cucumber (Cucumis sativus). The putative CsSCR protein contains conserved GRAS family domains and is extremely similar to AtSCR from Arabidopsis thaliana. SCR proteins are transcription factors involved in root radial patterning and are required for maintenance of the quiescent centre and differentiation of the endodermis. In comparison with other GRAS proteins from cucumber, phylogenetic analyses showed that CsSCR belongs to the SCR cluster. Increased CsSCR transcript accumulation was detected in somatic embryos and roots. Southern blot analysis and screening of the draft version of the cucumber genome confirmed the lack of close homologues in this species. CsSCR transcripts were localized by in situ hybridization in undifferentiated cells in the globular and heart stages of somatic embryogenesis, and in the endodermis of torpedo and cotyledonary stage somatic embryos, and developing primary and lateral roots. This localization was supported by the pattern of reporter gene activity driven by the CsSCR promoter in transgenic cucumber organs. These results suggest that CsSCR is likely to act in tissue radial organization during somatic embryogenesis and root development.",

    "abstract": "Pisum sativum plants were treated for 3 days with an aqueous solution of 100 μM Pb(NO3)2 or with a mixture of lead nitrate and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or [S,S]-ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid (EDDS) at equimolar concentrations. Lead decline from the incubation media and its accumulation and localization at the morphological and ultrastructural levels as well as plant growth parameters (root growth, root and shoot dry weight) were estimated after 1 and 3 days of treatment. The tested chelators, especially EDTA, significantly diminished Pb uptake by plants as compared to the lead nitrate-treated material. Simultaneously, EDTA significantly enhanced Pb translocation from roots to shoots. In the presence of both chelates, plant growth parameters remained considerably higher than in the case of uncomplexed Pb. Considerable differences between the tested chelators were visible in Pb localization both at the morphological and ultrastructural level. In Pb+EDTA-treated roots, lead was mainly located in the apical parts, while in Pb+EDDS-exposed material Pb was evenly distributed along the whole root length. Transmission electron microscopy and EDS analysis revealed that in meristematic cells of the roots incubated in Pb+EDTA, large electron-dense lead deposits were located in vacuoles and small granules were rarely noticed in cell walls or cytoplasm, while after Pb+EDDS treatment metal deposits were restricted to the border between plasmalemma and cell wall. Such results imply different ways of transport of those complexed Pb forms.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to characterise bioelectrical changes in the membrane potential of Marchantia polymorpha gametophyte cells after light/dark transitions and to determine the role of the proton pump and energy status of the M. polymorpha cells in generation of these changes. Darkening caused persistent depolarisation of the resting potential (RP) and generation of short-lasting potential changes that were not uniform among different thalli. In some plants (18%), the changes evoked by darkening were typical action potentials (APsdark), whereas in 69% of the plants, the changes had a form of action potential-like responses (APsdark-like) consisting of a transient depolarisation followed by a plateau phase, whose magnitude and duration were inconstant. The illumination of the M. polymorpha always evoked action potentials (APslight) if the thallus was illuminated with light intensity of at least 120 µmol photons m−2 s−1 after 30-min darkening. To analyse the involvement of H+-ATPase in formation of the illumination/darkening-induced electrical responses in M. polymorpha, the proton pump regulators were used. The proton pump inhibitor (20 µM FCCP) significantly diminished the RP and inhibited dark-induced APdark and/or APdark-like responses and illumination-induced APslight. After application of DCMU (20 µM), the RP was strongly depolarised and no response to light/dark was observed. Fusicoccin (20 µM), i.e., an activator of the proton pump, strongly hyperpolarised the membrane potential and blocked dark-induced APdark/APdark-like responses and illumination-induced APslight.",

Neither elicitation nor in situ application of PFD significantly had an effect on root growth until enzyme addition; however, the hairy root response to the culture conditions varied depending on enzyme type and dosage. The highest paclitaxel total yield (intracellular + extracellular) was determined in the one-phase elicited culture systems without enzymes and amounted to 264.2 µg/flask (1 434.9 ± 516.6 µg/g DW) and 29.6 µg/flask in root biomass and medium phase, respectively. Although the application of cellulolytic enzymes did not enhance the total paclitaxel production, they intensified paclitaxel release in a dose-depending manner. Among two examined cellulolytic enzyme treatments, Viscozyme® L addition caused the highest paclitaxel release up to 59% of its total content when used at a concentration of 0.01%. Whereas in two-phase in situ systems, the combination of Viscozyme® L at dosage of 0.5% and PFD-aerated, resulted in the highest extracellular paclitaxel concentration up to 20%.",

    "abstract": "Abstract To develop an easy and robust method for creating genetically stable and easily detectable Arabidopsis mutants, we adopted the polycistronic tRNA–gRNA CRISPR/Cas9 (PTG/Cas9) system, a multiplex gene-editing tool in rice, with PTOX as the reporter gene. The PTG/Cas9 system has a great potential in generating large deletions detectable by PCR, which greatly simplifies the laborious work of mutant screening. We constructed a PTOX –PTG/Cas9 system with five gRNAs and introduced it into Arabidopsis . At T1 generation, 24.4% of transgenic plants were chimeric with PCR-detectable deletions in PTOX locus, but no homozygous mutant was found, indicating that gene editing occurred predominantly in somatic cells. After a self-cross propagation, 60% of T1 chimeric plants were able to produce homozygous, heterozygous, or bi-allelic ptox offsprings. Inheritable homozygous ptox mutants without Cas9 gene can be obtained earliest at T2 generation. We further targeted five other genes using the same procedure and achieved homozygous Cas9-free mutants with large deletions for all genes within three generations. We established a standard and reliable protocol to generate stable inherited deletion mutants in 2–3 generations along with simple PCR screening methods. We conclude that the rice PTG/Cas9 system is an efficient, easy, and rapid tool to edit genes in Arabidopsis . We propose that it could be applied to other genes in Arabidopsis , and it might have the potential to edit genes in other plant species as well.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The efficiency of the root capacitance method is still judged contradictorily. It was, therefore, aimed to verify that the electrical capacitance ( C R ) and impedance ( Z R ) measured between ground electrode (pushed into the soil) and plant electrode (clamped on the stem) really represented the root system present in the soil. An ‘electrode separation experiment’ and a ‘root excision experiment’ were performed on potted maize plants cultivated in arenosol. The partial electrical separation of the ground electrode (restriction of the current flow in the topsoil) caused no significant changes in the capacitance and impedance of either the soil or the plant–soil system. This suggested that the current flows through a multitude of soil solution pathways, not predominantly on the wet soil surface. The progressive excision of the main root branches caused a gradual decrease in C R (31–39% of the initial value) and an increase in Z R (4.4- to 5.2-fold that of intact plants). C R showed a much stronger correlation with root dry mass ( R 2 = 0.807) than with stem cross-sectional area ( R 2 = 0.424) in intact plants. The closeness of the latter relationship decreased further ( R 2 = 0.377) after whole root excision. The results clearly demonstrated that the root system dominated the measured capacitance and impedance, though the role of the stem base was not negligible. In conclusion, the capacitance method is worth considering in future studies as an adequate non-intrusive approach to evaluate root size in the soil.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study was conducted to determine if common buckwheat ( Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) residues affect a phenolics composition in soil, and are effective for limiting emergence, growth and metabolic changes in barnyard grass ( Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P. Beauv.), wild oat ( Avena fatua L.), yellow foxtail ( Setaria pumila Schult.), silky windgrass ( Apera spica-venti L.), catchweed bedstraw ( Galium aparine L.), scentless mayweed ( Matricaria inodora L.), and tiny vetch ( Vicia hirsuta L.). In the study, the residues of 14-day-old buckwheat plants were used (cv. Hruszowska). After removal of the above-ground parts, the buckwheat root residues (BRR) remained in the soil for an additional 7 days before the weeds were sown. For comparison, under the same cultivation conditions, the effect of entire buckwheat plant residues (BPR) in soil was assessed. BPR and BRR in the soil caused a decrease in the emergence of all weed species except the tiny vetch. The growth of barnyard grass, wild oat, yellow foxtail, catchweed bedstraw, and scentless mayweed was inhibited by BRR, but not BPR. BRR had a particularly strong inhibitory effect on the growth of scentless mayweed (SM) and catchweed bedstraw (CB). Thirty-day-old SM and CB control plants were about 4 and 3.5 times higher, respectively, than plants growing in the presence of BRR. Furthermore, chlorophyll and carotenoid contents in the barnyard grass and catchweed bedstraw were more prominently reduced by BRR than BPR. Stressful conditions caused by buckwheat residues in the soil increased the level of phenolic compounds in the tissues of weeds examined. Soil with buckwheat residues contained a low level of phenolic compounds, which may indicate their slow release from the residue or rapid utilisation by microorganisms. These phenolic compounds probably cannot be directly responsible for allelopathic inhibition of weed emergence and growth.",

    "abstract": "Responses of plants exposed to drought and rewatering have been well documented; however, little is known concerning strategies of psammophyte to drought and rewatering under different soil nutrient regimes. For this study, Pennisetum centrasiaticum under two soil nutrient regimes was subjected to progressive drought and subsequent rewatering. Soil water status, gas exchange characteristics, chlorophyll a fluorescence characteristics as well as biomass traits were measured to investigate ecophysiological responses. Net photosynthesis rate (P n), stomatal conductance (g s), water use efficiency, maximum quantum efficiency of photosynthesis system II (PSII, F V/F M), electron transport flux per cross section (ET0/CS0), and performance index on cross section basis (PICS) were suppressed during drought periods for both nutrient regimes. Meanwhile, leaf intercellular CO2 concentration (C i ), minimal fluorescence intensity (F 0), and dissipated energy flux per cross section (DI0/CS0) increased. Reversible downregulation of PSII photochemistry and enhanced thermal dissipation of excess excitation energy (DI0/CS0) contributed to enhanced photo-protection in drought-stressed plants. Thus, the results indicate that P. centrasiaticum is capable of withstanding and surviving extreme drought events, and the recovery pattern of stressed P. centrasiaticum under both nutrient regimes was similar. However, fertilization increased the biomass and the variation in gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence characteristics during drought periods. Additionally, fertilization accelerated the process of drought and aggravated stress under extreme drought events. Thus, the fertilization strategy used in P. centrasiaticum restoration should be carefully selected—fertilization may not always be beneficial.",

    "abstract": "Kunitz trypsin inhibitor (KTI) is one of the widely studied protease inhibitors (PIs) and has been reported to take part in plant defense mechanism during pathogenesis. Numerous plant-origin recombinant KTIs have been described to exhibit anti-pathogenic properties and were used to fight pathogens in the field of pharmacology and agriculture. In this study, a novel Kunitz trypsin inhibitor gene, ClKTI, was isolated from a medicinal herb plant, turmeric, Curcuma longa. The full-length ClKTI gene is 754 bp long (Accession No. KF889322.1 in NCBI database) and it was obtained using 5′/3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique. ClKTI has an open reading frame of 639 bp length which encodes for 213 amino acids and contains the Kunitz-family motif, (V-X-D-X2-G-X2-L-X5-Y-X-I) and an altered reactive site motif, (G/E-I-S). Sequence similarity search using BLASTX showed that ClKTI shared the highest similarity to KTI from Theobroma cacao with 58% max identity while conserved domains search resulted in ClKTI having specific hits with Kunitz-family soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI). Phylogenetic studies suggested that ClKTI is related to T. cacao while protein homology modeling analysis indicated that it has 12 β-sheets with three disulfide bridges. Using real-time quantitative PCR, the ClKTI gene expression pattern in five different tissues (flower, basal stem, stem, rhizome and root) treated with methyl-jasmonate (MeJA) was studied where MeJA was suggested to regulate expression of PI genes in plants. The results indicated that the expression of ClKTI generally increased in the MeJA-treated tissues with the root tissues possessing the highest expression and stem tissues showed the highest expression fold-change.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The proposed spectral control of the adaptive metabolic responses to drought was tested by the comparison of two wheat genotypes with different stress tolerance. White light was used as the reference to see the effects of the three altered ratios of blue, red, and far-red spectral components, which conditions are referred to as blue, pink, and far-red lights. Under all spectral conditions, drought greatly reduced the growth of both genotypes. However, the glutathione content decreased and the proline level increased, independently of the spectrum, only in the sensitive genotype. Far-red light greatly decreased the amount of cystine and glutathione disulphide during the stress which resulted in their lower ratios compared to the reduced forms only in the tolerant genotype. The maintained more reducing redox environment contributes to its better stress tolerance. In far-red light, drought induced a greater accumulation of several free amino acids (mHis, Val, Ile, Leu, Asn, His, Tyr, Lys, Arg) in the tolerant genotype, while a smaller one in the sensitive genotype compared to the other spectral conditions. The transcript level of the genes related to amino acid and glutathione metabolism was also different between the two genotypes under this condition. The present results indicate the adaptive adjustment of glutathione and amino acid levels by far-red light during drought which observation can serve as a basis for the spectrum-dependent modification of the protective metabolites (glutathione, proline) of crops to reduce the stress-induced damages.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to investigate subsequent effects of short-term (30 min) ozone stress acting on wheat callus cells grown on media containing hydrophobic (tocopherol) and hydrophilic (gallic acid) antioxidant supplemented to the medium separately or in mixture. 7 days after ozone treatment of in vitro culture of winter wheat cells the fresh mass of calli, the activity of antioxidant enzymes, proline concentration and proportions of the major lipid fractions of cell membranes were determined. The physicochemical parameters characterizing the mechanical properties of monolayers formed by phospholipid and monogalactoglyceride fractions (model of hydrophobic/hydrophilic membrane) were established. It has been shown that oxidative stress induced by ozone treatment caused an increase in mass of calli (relative to the control), dependent on the presence of tocopherol and gallic acid. Changes of MDA level, of activity of antioxidative enzymes and of composition of membrane lipids demonstrate cell adaptation to stressful conditions. The physicochemical parameters of lipid layers determined from model experiments performed using Langmuir trough technique pointed to the changes in the structure of phospholipids caused by ozone stress and indicated that the presence of tocopherol and gallic acid effectively reversed these changes. Galactose groups in polar part of galactolipids may be a \"trap\" for ROS, reducing their access to the interior of the membranes. The wheat callus cells use this mechanism in the process of adaptation, as ozone treatment resulted in the reconstruction of membranes by increasing the share of monogalactolipids. Cooperation between tocopherol and gallic acid in the reactions taking place in the presence of ozone was also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Although the fern Platycerium bifurcatum is popular among the producers of ornamental plants, it is a species of relatively poorly known physiology. Studies concerning the impact of the red/far-red (R/FR) ratio on photomorphogenesis refer primarily to spermatophytes. However, quite different phytochrome response mechanism functions in ferns, involving the localization of physiologically active form of phytochrome in the cytoplasm, without translocation to the nucleus. This work determined the reaction of young fern sporotrophophylls to the change of the R/FR ratio and investigated sporophyte ontogeny in various spectral light composition using non-destructive testing methods. It has been shown that the development of morphogenic sporophyte depends on the R/FR ratio. At a high R/FR ratio, sporotrophophylls showed a slower growth compared to those growing at a low value. A high R/FR value resulted in lower photochemical performance of PSII and adverse changes in the functioning of the acceptor portion of the PSII reaction center, while the PSII vitality analysis indicated the positive effect of simulated shadow. The value of the R/FR ratio did not affect the intensity of blue-green leaf fluorescence. However, the fluorescence intensity of red and far-red was significantly higher in plants growing at higher R/FR values. The analysis of leaf optical properties indicated higher concentrations of carotenoids and anthocyanins in the leaves of plants grown under the lower R/FR ratio. Determining the effect of spectral light composition on the physiology of this species may be useful for plant breeders and for the protection of these epiphytes in natural habitats.",

Both JA-Me and gaseous ethylene applied during the inductive long night caused a decrease in the number of flower buds generated by P. nil. Application of ethylene did not affected niether the level of endogenous jasmonates in the cotyledons during the 16 h long inductive night, nor the inhibitory effect of JA-Me on the flowering of P. nil accompanied by variations in ethylene production. The application of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin)—a jasmonate biosynthesis inhibitor—slightly stimulated flowering. Our results have shown that the mechanisms of P. nil flower inhibition by jasmonates and ethylene are independent.",

    "abstract": "Most of commercially important crops, including maize and common bean, are sensitive to water deficit and salinity. Polyamines are considered to be osmotic and salt tolerance modulators and biochemical indicators of these stresses. In the present study, we measured organ-specific changes in levels of free, microsome- and thylakoid-associated polyamines in leaves and roots of maize and common bean plants exposed for 24 h to osmotic and saline stresses. Putrescine levels were generally higher in the studied organs of both species and under both stresses; only in the roots of salt-treated bean it considerably decreased. In both species, salt stress (200 mM NaCl) induced a significant decrease in free spermidine in roots. We observed a significant decrease in the contents of all polyamines associated with the microsomes isolated from the roots of maize and bean growing in sorbitol and salt conditions. Also the microsomes isolated from the leaves of stressed plants were characterized by the lower contents of polyamines. Our data showed a reduction of putrescine content, with significantly decreased spermidine and spermine levels in thylakoids isolated from the chloroplasts of maize and bean plants growing under both stresses. The results indicate that the studied maize and bean cultivars are rather drought-sensitive. Additionally, microsome- and thylakoid-associated polyamines seem to be good markers of plant stress tolerance.",

    "abstract": "The study aimed to determine the usefulness of isothermal calorimetry and FT-Raman spectroscopy for the early evaluation of rigid ryegrass resistance to fenoxaprop-P ethyl (active ingredient one of aryloxyphenoxypropionate herbicides). The calorimetric measurements were done on the 4-day-old seedlings of susceptible and resistant biotypes of rigid ryegrass (Lolium rigidum Goud.) for 72 h, at 20 °C. It was observed that the specific thermal power–timecurves of the susceptible and resistant biotypes growing on water (control) were qualitatively similar. Herbicides changed the shape of the specific thermal power–time curves of both biotypes. Furthermore, the total specific thermal energy was significantly higher for the seedlings of resistant biotype, growing both on water or herbicide, as compared to the susceptible ones. The analysis of the seedlings' endosperm, conducted using FT-Raman spectroscopy, showed a weaker intensity of the bands in the spectra derived from the resistant biotype. Differences in the specific thermal power–time curves and FT-Raman spectra between susceptible and resistant biotypes growing on water indicate that the sensitive and resistant biotypes are metabolically and chemically different already in the early stages of the seedling growth. We conclude that isothermal calorimetry and FT-Raman spectroscopy are efficient tools for the early detection of rigid ryegrass resistance to fenoxaprop-P ethyl.",

    "abstract": "Changes in proteome level as a result of methyl jasmonate and cholesterol treatment were investigated. The identified proteins were often involved in response to stress caused by various treatments. Furthermore, 18 proteins were expressed in treatment-specific manner. In this study, the fenugreek plants were treated with methyl jasmonate (as an elicitor) and cholesterol (as a precursor of steroids and steroidal saponins) to check reaction at the level of the proteome to stress and to investigate steroidal saponin (diosgenin) biosynthesis. Proteins were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and identified by MALDI-ToF/ToF followed by database searches using Mascot search engine. Totally, 63 and 41 protein spots were differentially expressed after methyl jasmonate and cholesterol treatment, respectively. These proteins were classified into seven groups: photosynthesis, energy, metabolism, protein metabolism, secondary metabolism, stress and defense, and other. We found that 9 proteins were responsive to all treatments, and 18 proteins expressed in treatment-specific manner. Higher level of photosynthetic proteins sensitive to both biotic and abiotic stimuli was detected. In addition, proteins related to the stress (especially oxidative) and defense, protein, and secondary metabolism were overexpressed. The results indicate that methyl jasmonate and cholesterol elicited a defense reaction at the proteome level as a response to stress. The usefulness of 2-DE method for identification of proteins related with species-specific metabolic pathways is restricted. Integration of transcriptome data with proteomic analysis improved annotation process.",

    "abstract": "Physiological dormancy is a characteristic of the seeds of plants that are exposed to adverse harsh environmental conditions. Many tree seeds from the northern hemisphere have acquired deep dormancy as an adaptation to the winter period. Such kinds of dormancy can be removed by cold stratification. This physiological process is regulated through abscisic and gibberellic acids signal transduction, in which ABI5, 14-3-3 and RGL2 have a negative response to cold stratification and cause dormancy breaking. Our study is, to our knowledge, the first to report tissue localisation of ABI5 and RGL2 in deeply physiologically dormant seeds. Localisation of these proteins differs in time (weeks of stratification) and space (anatomy of the embryo root). Studies showed that changes occurred on three levels: (1) tissue, as the fluorescence signal throughout the weeks of stratification was localised in different regions of the embryo axes, and these changes were associated with changes in development regulation of the individual regions; (2) cell, either in nucleus or in cytoplasm, involving regulation of gene expression, and synthesis and inactivation in cytoplasm; and (3) organelle, specifically in nuclei/nucleoli, indicating transcription regulation of the specific genes. At the end of stratification, when dormancy is broken, ABI5 and RGL2 were not noticeable in the cells of the apical meristem. ABI5 likely blocked germination through inhibition of meristem activity, whereas RGL2 through blocking of procambial cell differentiation. We speculate that similar molecular and cellular mechanisms exist among other seeds characterised by physiological dormancy.",

This study aimed at evaluating the early response of two double-low cultivars of winter oilseed rape: hybrid (Nelson) and open pollinated (Digger) on the foliar fertilization with S and B in two terms: fall and spring, based on the rate of leaf greenness index (SPAD) and seven indicators of chlorophyll a fluorescence (FL). On 7th or 9th day after the application of liquid fertilizers, the selected parameters of FL and SPAD were determined on the leaves of rape. As a result, a significant effect of foliar B and S supplementation on the yield of oilseed rape was found. Principal component analysis (PCA) allowed for a separation for each of the cultivars the two parameters of FL, namely Tfm and Fv/F0, which are sensitive indicators of a physiological state of the rape plants shortly after foliar S and B dressing.",

Intercompartmental differences between cytosol and mitochondria have not been studied before. Aboveground parts of plants were treated with different pH variants of AR and oxidative damages (lipid peroxidation) as well as antioxidative enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, SOD; ascorbate peroxidase, APx; glutathione peroxidase, GSH-Px) in the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were examined. The character of changes in antioxidative enzyme activities and of oxidative damages was closely connected with the cell compartment as well as with pH and time after treatment. The activity of both APx and GSH-Px increased more intensively in cytosol. Contrastingly, strong induction of lipid peroxide formation was observed in the mitochondrial fraction. In both cell compartments SOD activity did not change significantly. The results suggest that cucumber mitochondria are more susceptible to oxidative damage caused by AR than cytosol. Antioxidative defence of cytosol appeared to provide sufficient protection against the oxidative stress imposed by AR.",

To understand better the NaCl stress response of lupine embryo axes, ultrastructural approach combined with analysis of DNA degradation was used. In this study lupine embryo axes were cultured in vitro on the medium supplemented with two salt concentrations 250 and 500 mM to differ the reaction. To assess the rate of DNA damage, alkaline electrophoresis of isolated nuclei and DNA fragmentation analysis were performed. Results of these studies suggest programmed cell death induction under salinity stress. Moreover, ultrastructure observations revealed other characteristic features of programmed cell death like endoplasmic reticulum reorganization, increased level of vacuolization, chromatin condensation and starch grains degradation. Our comparative analysis of ultrastructure changes and DNA fragmentation speak in favour of programmed cell death in lupine (Lupinus luteus L. 'Mister') embryo axes treated for 12 h with 250 and 500 mM NaCl.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The plants have developed several defense mechanisms to counteract pathogens. Among others, it includes activation of antioxidant enzymes like β -glucosidase and guaiacol peroxidase (GPX). These proteins participate in the oxidation of phenolic compounds, contributing to their increased fungitoxicity. The study aimed to analyze changes in the activity of β -glucosidase and GPX in four genotypes of winter oilseed rape (Mendel, Monolit, Polka, line L1425) inoculated with seven isolates: Alternaria brassicicola , Alternaria brassicae , Alternaria alternata (3 strains), Ulocladium chartarum (syn. A. chartarum ), and Cladosporium cladosporioides . We noted that the varieties of oilseed rape, tested fungal species, and time of the plant material collection had significant ( P &lt; 0.001) effect on the activity of β -glucosidase and GPX per protein and fresh matter content comparing to the control group. A. brassicicola caused the highest mean increase in β -glucosidase and GPX activity in all examined genotypes, while other pathogens had a lower impact. Significantly lower β -glucosidase activity inoculated by various pathogens was noted between the L 1425 line and other varieties. GPX activity was in the opposite, the lowest activity was recorded in the Mendel variety, and the highest in the L 1425 line.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the growth–temperature relationship in plants using a quantitative perspective of a recently derived growth functional. We showed that auxin-induced growth is achieved by the diffusion rate, which is almost constant or slowly ascending in temperature, while the diffusion rate of fusicoccin (FC)-induced growth increases monotonically with temperature for the entire temperature range (0–45) °C, although for some concentrations of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), “super-diffusion” takes place for unperturbed growth. We also calculated the cross-correlations and the derivative of cross-correlations for elongation growth (rate) and pH as a function of time delay (lag) parameterised by temperature for artificial pond water (APW) control conditions (endogenous growth) and exogenous IAA and FC that were introduced into the medium. Dimensionality analysis revealed that discontinuities in the cross-correlation derivative corresponded to H+ ion kinetics, which attained definite numerical values that were approximately proportional to the (logarithm of) proton secretion rates (or relative buffer acidification). Furthermore, three types of experiments were compared: for abraded coleoptiles, coleoptile segments and intact growing seedlings. From the cross-correlation analysis, it was found that the timing of IAA and FC-induced proton secretion and growth matched well. Unambiguous results concerning the canvas constituting acid growth hypothesis were obtained by cross- and auto-correlation analysis: (1) for abraded coleoptiles, because of the lowering of the cuticle potential barrier, auxin-induced cell wall pH decreased simultaneously with the change in growth rate; no advancement or retardation of pH (proton efflux rate) or growth rate took place, (2) exogenous protons were able to substitute for auxin thus causing wall loosening and growth, (3) although the underlying molecular mechanisms differ vastly, a potent stimulator of proton secretion, the fungal toxin FC, promoted growth that was similar to auxin, although of an elevated intensity; as for auxin—no advancement or retardation took place.",

    "abstract": "Huge amount of information on the plants response to drought is available throughout the literature; however, extremely rare information concerns effects of limited water availability on cation exchange capacity (CEC) and surface acidity of plant roots despite their importance for cations uptake by plants. As it is known, the CEC and acidity of barley roots markedly decrease under a low soil moisture and osmotic stresses, so we studied the behavior of the other cereal plants. Surface charge properties of roots of wheat, triticale, rye, oats and barley grown in hydroponics under osmotic stress induced at tillering stage by various mannitol concentrations were determined using a back-titration method. Roots size distributions were measured also. The osmotic stress caused down to a fivefold decrease in the CEC and a twofold decrease in the relative amount of surface functional groups of medium acidic strength, whereas no well-defined trends were observed for surface acidity. The above changes were the highest for rye and the lowest for oats. The general root's architecture remained roughly same; however,' the roots length markedly decreased under stress. The smallest decrease in roots length was observed for barley. Decrease in CEC and roots length may be the primary reasons for severe limitation in nutrient uptake by plants during drought.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The effect of short-term high (+ 40 °C, 2 h) (HT) and positive low-temperature (+ 4 C, 2 h) (LT) stresses on leaf micromorphology and ultrastructure of mesophyll cells in winter rye was investigated. After HT, leaf blade relief became reticulate, while under control conditions and after low-temperature stress, leaf blade relief was folded. The ultrastructure of the leaf mesophyll cells of control plants was nominal: in the chloroplasts of regular lenticular shape, a well-developed thylakoid system immersed in a fine-grained stroma was clearly visible. Short-term HT caused the destruction of thylakoid membranes. A wave-like packing of granal thylakoids, a significant expansion of the lumenal spaces, and a disruption of the structural connection between the granal and stroma thylakoids were noted. There was an accumulation of lipid drops in the cytoplasm. LT stress caused intensive formation of plastoglobules, a decrease in the number and size of starch grains in the chloroplasts. Destruction of thylakoid membranes was not seen. After HT stress, the mitochondria noticeably \"swelled\", and the membranes of the cristae became less contrasting. After LT stress, significant changes occurred in the morphology of organelles: some of the mitochondria kept a round shape, but some acquired a lenticular or \"dumbbell\" shape. It was found that, depending on the type of temperature exposure, various adaptive programs are implemented in plant cells, which are accompanied by a complex of ultrastructural changes, thanks to which plants are able to successfully tolerate short-term exposure to stressful temperatures during active vegetation.",

Although the related genes and loci associated with carotenoid metabolism in many species are well reported, in cassava they are poorly understood. In the present study, GWAS base on SLAF-seq was used in detecting the related genes and loci correlated to carotenoid contents in 98 accessions from a cassava F1 mapping population. The 98 accessions were divided into four subgroups. On the basis of general linear and compressed linear models, 144 genes were detected by selective sweep analysis, and 84 SNPs and 694 genes were detected by association mapping, in which Manes.04G164700 (XanDH) and Manes.11G105300 (AAO) were probably involved in the downstream pathway of carotenoid metabolism, and their expressions in six cassava genotypes were confirmed. Our results will be useful in yellow-root cassava variety improvement and provide the most effective and sustainable approach to maximize the nutritional and health benefits of carotenoid to a large number of populations.",

However, the prevalence of AS in the moso bamboo genome is still unclear. Transcriptome sequencing of four different tissues indicated that 36.17% of the genes in the moso bamboo genome undergo AS. The predominant type of AS found in moso bamboo was intron retention (38.70%), followed by alternative 5′ (31.86%) and 3′ (16.68%) splice sites and exon skipping (11.46%). The number of AS events in every gene was relevant to gene characteristics and gene expression. We also observed that the alternative 5′ and 3′ splice sites were significantly enriched in the fourth nucleotide downstream or upstream of the dominant splice sites. Furthermore, the frequency of AS types as well as the quantity of AS events significantly varied among different tissues. The findings of the present study provide a comprehensive view of AS events in moso bamboo.",

    "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generally regarded as harmful products of oxygenic metabolism causing oxidative stress and cell damage are also important for control and regulation of biological processes. ROS can be generated by various enzymatic activities and removed by an array of ROS-scavenging molecules in the cell. In plants, the generation of ROS initiated by the plasma membrane NADPH oxidase can be used for controlled polymer breakdown leading to cell wall loosening during extension growth. The mosaic (MSC16) mitochondrial mutant of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) has marked phenotypic changes, including a slower growth rate which partially may result from disturbed leaf carbon and energy metabolism and ROS/antioxidants equilibrium. Cytochemical localization of H2O2 in leaf cells showed lower total level of H2O2 particularly in the apoplast of MSC16 leaf cells as compared to WT. The activity of plasma membrane NADPH oxidase (EC 1.6.3.1) was about 30% lower in plasmalemma vesicles isolated from MSC16 leaf tissue as compared to WT. The total foliar ascorbate pool (reduced and oxidized) was about 35% higher in MSC16 compared to WT leaves due to an increased content of the oxidized form. About 3% of the whole-leaf ascorbate was localized in the apoplast but in MSC16 it was considerably more reduced. We conclude that the lower apoplastic ROS content caused by decreased activity of plasma membrane NADPH oxidase and lower amounts of H2O2 in the apoplast may also contribute to altered growth of the MSC16 cucumber mutant.",

    "abstract": "The strategy I developed by dicotyledonous plants to efficiently acquire of iron involve the action of proton-extruding H+-ATPases. These proteins are responsible for the solubilization of iron through rhizosphere acidification. Previously, it has been documented that acidification of the rhizosphere involve specific isoforms of plasma membrane proton pumps in response to Fe deficiency in dicot plants such as Arabidopsis, Cucumis sativus, Lycopersicon and Pisum sativum. In this work, we have investigated the effect of Fe nutritional status on the activity of plasma membrane H+-ATPases at the level of transcription, protein accumulation and post-translational modification. Two genes (CsHA2 and CsHA3) were isolated from different parts of cucumber and their expression analyzed under different Fe treatments (0, 25 and 80 μM Fe). Transcript level of CsHA2 was detected in both vegetative organs (roots and cotyledons), while CsHA3 expression was limited only to the roots in immature plants. These two genes were up-regulated under Fe deficiency in cucumber roots and their expression was decreased in the presence of 80 μM Fe. We have shown that the post-translational modification of protein via phosphorylation and its accumulation as a target of activation in Fe-deficient plants might not be responsible for the increase in the H+-ATPase activity.",

The expression pattern of PnACO1 was studied under different conditions (photoperiod and auxin), an adequate balance of which determines P. nil flowering. It was shown that the gene was transcribed in all the examined organs of the 5-day-old seedling and was strongly activated by auxin. Our results also revealed that PnACO1 transcript accumulation in the cotyledons showed diurnal oscillations under both LD and SD conditions. On the basis of presented and previously obtained data, we suggest that flowering inhibition evoked by IAA in P. nil results from its stimulatory effect on both ACC synthase and oxidase gene expression and, consequently, enhances ethylene production.",

The obtained enzyme preparation indicates only one band of R f 0.67 on 8% non-denaturing PAGE consisting of two polypeptides of 42 and 17 kDa in SDS/PAGE. Highly purified 1-O-IAGlc-SugAc shows maximum transferase activity with monosaccharides (mannose, glucose, and galactose), lower activity with disaccharides (melibiose, gentobiose) and trisaccharide (raffinose) and minimal enzymatic activity with oligosaccharides from the raffinose family as well. The novel acyltransferase exhibits, besides its primary indoleacetylation of sugar, minor hydrolytic and disproportionation activities producing free IAA and supposedly 1,2-di-O-(indole-3-acetyl)-β-glucose, respectively. Presumably, 1-O-IAGlc-SugAc, like 1-O-indole-3-acetyl-β-d-glucose-dependent myo-inositol acyltransferase (1-O-IAGlc-InsAc), is another member of the serine carboxypeptidase-like (SCPL) acyltransferase family.",

    "abstract": "A monoclonal antibody, JIM 20, derived against an extensin type of hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein (HRGP) from pea, showed high affinity for HRGP in pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.]. Electrophoretic separation of Tris–SDS extracted proteins from suspension cells of pearl millet revealed a range of PM-HRGP polypeptides having a glycan epitope, which reacted with JIM 20. A high molecular mass band, probably an HRGP aggregate or polymer, and a few low molecular mass polypeptides were recognized by JIM 20 during Western blot analysis. Treatment of pearl millet suspension cells with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of an endogenous peroxidase resulted in insolubilization of HRGP polypeptides with molecular weights between 45 and 33 kDa. To investigate the gene coding for an extensin type of HRGP, a fosmid-based genomic library of pearl millet having a fourfold genome coverage was constructed. A partial sequence of 378 bp of an HRGP gene was obtained by PCR amplification of pearl millet DNA with a primer pair designed from the conserved regions of monocotyledon extensin type of HRGPs. Screening the genomic library using the homologous probe developed from the 378-bp PCR product resulted in the isolation of five fosmid clones. Restriction mapping of these fosmids resulted in an 11.8-kb region around an HRGP gene in pearl millet. The newly characterized gene, PM-HRGP, had all the characteristic features of a monocotyledon extensin type of HRGP. An intron at the 3′ untranslated region of the gene was identified by cDNA cloning. Differential expression of the PM-HRGP gene was observed during compatible and incompatible interactions of pearl millet with the downy mildew pathogen Sclerospora graminicola (Sacc) Schroet. Induced expression of the gene was observed only in case of an incompatible interaction.",

Here, spontaneous APs (SAPs) in relation to endogenous stem movement named circumnutation (CN) have been investigated in Helianthus annuus in different light conditions in freely circumnutating and immobilized plants. Extracellular electrical measurements and time-lapse photography were carried out simultaneously. The parameters of CN (trajectory length, period, and direction) and the number and transmission direction of SAPs were analysed. In continuous light (25–40 μmol m−2 s−1), all plants circumnutating vigorously in a regular elliptical manner and no SAPs were observed. In light/dark conditions, the plants circumnutated in a daily pattern, most SAPs were observed in the dark and freely circumnutated sunflowers had two times more SAPs (10 SAPs/24 h/plant) than the immobilized plants (5 SAPs/24 h/plant). In continuous very low light (5 μmol m−2 s−1), the plants circumnutated weakly and irregularly and SAPs appeared without the circadian pattern. 3–5 SAPs/24/plant occurred in the freely circumnutating and immobilized plants. In light/dark and continuous very low light conditions, an ultradian rhythm of SAPs was observed and the mean spacing between SAPs was approx. 121–271 min in the freely circumnutating and immobilized plants. Under all light conditions, more SAPs were transmitted basipetally than acropetally. One-hour lasting series of 3–4 min spaced SAPs locally propagated were observed as well in very low light. Basipetal and acropetal SAPs passing along the stem motor region accompany irregularity, changes in the CN trajectory direction, and stem torsion. These results demonstrate that APs and CN changes play a role in plant adaptation to light conditions and that there is an ultradian rhythm of SAPs beside ultradian CN rhythm.",

    "abstract": "Liverworts are pioneer plants that colonized lands. They had to cope with frequent sea water flooding causing salt stress. The role of vacuoles and in particular slow-activating (SV) channels in the salt stress tolerance was addressed in the present study. A patch-clamp method was used to study sodium fluxes through the tonoplast of the liverwort Conocephalum conicum. The whole-vacuole measurements carried out in a symmetrical Na+ concentration allowed recording of slowly activated outward currents typical for SV channels. In a Na+ gradient promoting an efflux of Na+ from the vacuole, the outward rectifying properties of SV channels were reduced and inward Na+ currents with different inactivation rates were recorded. Single channel analysis proved that a decrease in cytoplasmic Na+ concentration evoked an increase in the open probability of the channels and shifted the activation voltages towards negative values. The number of SV channels recorded at negative voltages was dependent on the vacuolar calcium and decreased at the high concentration of this ion in the vacuole. In some of the tested patches, the channels exhibited a flickering type of activity and two different conductance levels. The role of SV channels in Na+ accumulation during salt stress and its removal after periods of flooding is discussed in the present paper.",

This research aimed at evaluating the autoallelopathic effect of aqueous extracts (AEs) prepared from various parts of Canadian goldenrod and giant goldenrod against vegetative growth, and biomass accumulation of both goldenrods. In the stage of 5–6 leaves, goldenrod plants, were foliar sprayed with AEs, at concentrations of 5 or 10%. The biochemical properties of AEs, i.e., total phenolic content, total antioxidant potential and selected plant hormones, were examined. Two and ten days after spraying (DAS), damages to aboveground parts of goldenrods (necrosis and wilting) were visually assessed. The fresh mass of above- and belowground parts of goldenrods were measured 21 DAS. AEs from various parts of Canadian goldenrod or giant goldenrod displayed autoallelopathic properties of inhibitory nature. The phytotoxic potential of AEs varied depending on their source. Canadian goldenrod was more susceptible to the AEs, manifested by more significant damages to aboveground parts and a greater decrease in above- and belowground biomass. The most effective against growth and development of Canadian goldenrod and giant goldenrod were AEs from rhizomes, which caused a reduction of fresh biomass of goldenrods up to 42%, compared to water-treated control.",

Overexpression of DREB genes enhances the resistance to multiple abiotic stresses, but also causes dwarfism and delayed flowering in many plant species. In this study, constitutive overexpression of AtDREB1A in soybean plants caused dwarfism and delayed-flowering phenotypes. The delayed-flowering phenotype was not affected by day length and could not be reversed by exogenous gibberellic acid. The expression levels of flowering-related genes were determined by quantitative real-time RCR. The Glyma11g13220 (designated as GmVRN1-like) expression was strongly induced in transgenic plants. GmVRN1-like was homologous to the Arabidopsis thaliana VRN1 gene (At3g18990). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that AtDREB1A could bind the dehydration-responsive element motif, ACCGAC, in a region −157 to −186 bp upstream of GmVRN1-like. The motif shared 100 % identity with the DRE sequence present in RD29A. Our results imply that the delayed-flowering of AtDREB1A-overexpressing plants might be caused by up-regulating of GmVRN1-like gene.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to estimate the endogenous abscisic acid (ABA) content in tulip 'Apeldoorn' torpedo and mature somatic embryos. Moreover, the effect of exogenous ABA and/or its inhibitor fluridone on somatic embryo maturation and conversion into plantlets was investigated. Torpedo-stage somatic embryos were subcultured on media containing 5 μM of picloram and 1 μM of 6-benzyl-aminopurine (BAP)—control, and combinations of ABA (0 or 10 μM) and/or fluridone (0 or 30 μM) for 1 week. Then, the torpedo embryos were transferred to a maturation medium containing 0.25 μM of α-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and 2.5 μM of BAP, without ABA and fluridone treatment, and cultivated under darkness or light for ten weeks. Endogenous ABA content (first time measured in tulip somatic embryos) was evaluated by ELISA test. The obtained results revealed that the highest level of endogenous ABA, at 17.45 nmol g−1 dry weight (DW), was recorded in torpedo-stage of tulip embryo development, only after 1 week of ABA treatment, and was nearly 10 times higher in comparison with the control. Simultaneous addition of ABA and fluridone to the medium resulted in the lowering of the ABA concentration to 9.58 nmol g−1 DW. During ten weeks of maturation of the embryos, the endogenous ABA content in mature tissue of tulip somatic embryo considerably decreased to an amount 0.87–1.33 nmol g−1 DW (irrespective of ABA and fluridone treatment) and did not differ significantly from control (0.59 nmol g−1 DW). Exogenous ABA and fluridone significantly decreased the growth value of fresh weight (FW) of the tulip torpedo-shaped and mature embryos under light conditions. Percentage of the DW of the torpedo embryos treated with exogenous ABA was significantly higher (15.43–17.02) in comparison with the control (10.87). Three to three and a half times more malformed mature embryos were noted under light conditions than in darkness, irrespective of ABA and fluridone treatment. The highest percentage of mature embryos forming shoots (conversion) was observed under light conditions in the control and after fluridone treatment (26 and 20%, respectively).",

    "abstract": "Abstract The role of phloem–xylem interaction via sucrose exchanges in recovery of dehydration impacts, specifically xylem embolism, has not been directly investigated thus far. Most previous studies were indirect approaches leading to suggestive conclusions. We hypothesized that a block in phloem loading and so no exchange of sucrose with xylem affect tolerance and recovery of tobacco plants ( Nicotiana tabacum ) during dehydration and after the rehydration phase. Transgenic N . tabacum ( αNtSUT1 -antisense) plants, which showed impaired phloem loading and high accumulation of soluble sugars in leaves, were compared to the wild-type (WT) plants. The water status, osmotic adjustments, leaf turgor, stomatal conductance, xylem cavitation, and stem xylem sucrose content were determined during dehydration and after the rehydration phases. Results showed that retention of sucrose outside phloem conduits highly improved water status, osmotic adjustment and turgidity of the source leaves in the transgenics during drought period. However, no impact occurred on stomata function and tolerance to xylem cavitation in α NtSUT1 . After the rehydration period, WT plants with free phloem transport and phloem–-xylem exchange of sucrose recovered better their water status, leaf turgidity, stomatal conductance and xylem functioning than αNtSUT1 plants. The accumulation of sucrose in leaves of transformants ameliorated their tolerance to water deficit by reinforcing the osmotic adjustment mechanism at the leaf level. However, lack of sucrose in phloem sieve resulted in impairment of hydraulic recovery of xylem from drought of αNtSUT1 after rehydration. This suggests a crucial role of the phloem–-xylem exchange of sucrose in refilling of embolized xylem vessels.",

    "abstract": "Abstract High molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW GS) represent an important fraction of endosperm-specific seed-storage proteins that provide elasticity to bread dough. Previously, the second cis -regulatory module (CRM2) was found to be one of the most conserved part of HMW GS promoters, which indicated its pre-eminent role in their gene regulation. Here, we observed that deletion of CRM2 from the promoters of the Bx7 and By8 HMW GS genes increased the leakage of their transient expression in wheat leaf tissue. The effect of a VP1, an Myb and an antisense bZIP transcription factor (TF)-binding site, potentially involved in endosperm-specific regulation within CRM2, was then studied. The activity of a Bx7 gene promoter containing a mutant CRM2 with altered VP1 and Myb TF-binding sites, but an intact bZIP TF-binding site, was similarly low to that of the wild type in leaves. Transactivation analysis and EMSA indicated the binding of TFs TabZIP34 and TabZIP115 to the Skn-1 motif GTCAT in CRM2 and the repression of Bx7 and By8 HMW GS gene promoter activity in leaves. TabZIP34 and TabZIP115 may be involved in the downregulation of HMW GS gene expression in vegetative tissues and early-stage endosperm as well its modulation during seed maturation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Hairy roots generated by Rhizobium rhizogenes- mediated transformation of yew ( Taxus spp.) is a promising approach to enhance production of Taxol ® (paclitaxel), which is one of the most effective anticancer drugs. As a prerequisite, it is pivotal to successfully produce Taxus seedlings for transformation. However, the deep dormancy of Taxus seeds leads to extreme difficulties in seed germination. Therefore, embryo rescue has been used to break the dormancy of Taxus baccata seeds, thereby producing seedlings for transformation. In the current study, a successful strategy of embryo rescue was to sterilize the surface of T. baccata seeds collected from the field at two different maturity stages (low and high). The strategy resulted in 100% germination rate, but it was worth noting that not all germinated embryos grew into fully developed plants. As a result, the present experiment introduced an innovative indicator—fully developed seedling index—to describe the growth of seedlings developed by germinated embryos. Collectively, the data revealed that 21 ± 4% of the seedlings eventually grew into fully developed plants. Regarding the development of the seedlings, the fully developed seedling index increased initially along with seedling growth, reaching a peak after 2 weeks. Subsequently, the fully developed seedling index from low maturity seeds and high maturity seeds began to decrease until it stabilized after 4 weeks and 7 weeks, respectively. Consequently, the new findings proved helpful to select T. baccata seeds with appropriate maturity, hence developing a reliable technique to produce viable seedlings for a transformation pipeline.",

    "abstract": "The current investigations of three genera plant virus cell-to-cell movement were presented. Viruses reveal different local transport strategies, but all of them are the results of virus factors–host components interactions. The Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) does not require capsid protein for translocation through plasmodesmata but 30 K movement protein participates in this process. It was found direct or indirect TMV movement proteins host partners in Tobamovirus movement like: pectin methylesterase, movement protein binding 2C, chaperones or cytoskeleton components and endoplasmatic reticulum membranes. The Potex- and Potyvirus cell-to-cell movement is closely related to replication network. The PVX capsid protein and triple gene block protein system are responsible for efficient local transport. Potyviruses move through the plasmodesmata by involving viral encoded proteins but not specific movement proteins. While the Potyvirus is the biggest known plant virus genus, host components participating in or regulating directly its plasmodesmata-movement are still not clear.",

Herewith, we report eight more mutants with enhanced tolerance to the AAL toxin. Phenotypic analysis showed that six of the mutants were reduced in size compared with their original background loh2. Furthermore, atr2 showed delayed flowering and senescence. The mutants were also evaluated for oxidative stress tolerance by growing them on ROS-inducing media supplemented with either aminotriazole or paraquat, generating, respectively, H2O2 or superoxide radicals. Oxidative stress, confirmed by induction of the marker genes, HIGH AFFINITY NITRATE TRANSPORTER At1G08090 and HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN 17 At3G46230, inhibited growth of all lines. However, while the original background loh2 developed necrotic lesions and died rapidly on ROS-inducing plant growth media, atr1, atr2, atr7 and atr9 remained green and viable. The tolerance against oxidative stress-induced cell death was confirmed by fresh weight and chlorophyll measurements. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that the expression of the EXTENSIN gene At5G46890, previously shown to be downregulated by aminotriazole in atr1, was repressed in all lines, consistent with the growth inhibition induced by oxidative stress. Taken together, the data indicate a complex link between growth, development and oxidative stress tolerance and indicates that growth inhibition can be uncoupled from oxidative stress-induced cell death.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate molecular basis of germination inhibition of Triticosecale under the influence of exogenous ABA. Seedlings were isolated from seeds after 48 h of germination in water (control sample) and 100 μM ABA solution. It was observed that the applied concentration of phytohormone caused a significant inhibition of germination and a suppressed contribution of polysomes in the total ribosomal fraction. To identify proteins whose expression was affected by ABA, a proteomic approach employing 2D electrophoresis was used. Proteome maps for both control and ABA-treated samples displayed over 2,200 Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained spots each. Protein spots showing either increase or decrease in spot intensity under the ABA influence were identified by mass spectrometry. Many of the identified proteins whose expression was stimulated by ABA proved to be stress-related, involved in nucleotide metabolism or playing a regulatory and signal transduction role, whereas proteins whose expression decreased are known to be involved in numerous metabolic pathways (including energy, carbohydrate or nucleotide metabolism) as well as related to genetic information processing and protein synthesis. Our results show that the germination inhibition caused by ABA is a result of multigene, diversified actions leading together to triticale growth suppression.",

    "abstract": "Plants growing under natural conditions are constantly exposed to ultraviolet (UV), primarily UV-A, radiation. Grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.) is a legume species resistant to harsh growing conditions, such as drought, salinity or periodic flooding. Due to the advantageous composition of seeds, it is used for consumption in such regions as South Asia or East Africa where high intensity of UV radiation occurs. Absorption of this spectral range causes changes in the photosynthetic apparatus of plants, including damage to the photosystem II (PSII) reaction centres. The aim of the work was to examine whether the use of the combination UV-A: red light as a source of radiation would enable quick acclimatization of the photosynthetic apparatus of grass pea to the negative effect of UV-A radiation. 14-day-old plants were exposed to UV-A:red radiation for 48 h. The plants exposed to UV-A:red radiation showed enhanced effective efficiency of PSII and increased total electron carriers, which enabled more effective photosynthesis at higher values of radiation intensity in comparison with control plants, kept under white LED light. At the same time, there were no statistically significant differences in both the photosynthetic pigment contents and the level of lipid peroxidation. The obtained results indicate that the observed increase in the efficiency of CO2 carboxylation after short-term UV-A:red radiation has resulted from the efficient linear electron transport due to maintaining the effective oxygen evolving complex (OEC) and increased total electron carriers.",

They constitute a significant element of the plant’s defence mechanism against both biotic (pests and diseases) and abiotic (elevated salinity, heavy metals) stresses. The aim of this research was to gain more information on the genetic background of BXs biosynthesis in rye ( Secale cereale L.) by isolating and sequencing the ScBx6 L318 and ScBx7 L318 genes encoding 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase and 7- O -methyltransferase, respectively. Using the modified Amplicon Express method, BAC clones containing the ScBx6 L318 and ScBx7 L318 genes were isolated and sequenced. The similarity between the ScBx6 L318 and ZmBx6 genes were, correspondingly, 78% and 68% in the coding sequence ( cds ) and the amino acid sequence (AA). A lesser similarity was found between the ScBx7 L318 and ZmBx7 genes (72% and 45% at the cds and AA levels, respectively) .",

    "abstract": "Abstract Zinc (Zn) deficiency causes serious issues to plant growth and development, negatively affecting crops in many world regions. On the other hand, Zn toxicity impairs plant growth, producing physiological alterations, and even cell death. In plants, two of the processes that most determine growth are nitrogen (N) metabolism and photosynthesis. In the last decades, several authors proved that silicon (Si) and calcium (Ca) mitigate the effects of various abiotic and biotic stresses in plants. The objective of this research is to study the effect of Si application to barley ( Hordeum vulgare cv. Nure) plants grown under Zn deficiency and Zn toxicity. Hence, barley plants were grown in hydroponics and supplied with a low Zn dose (0.01 µM ZnSO 4 ) and a high Zn dose (100 µM ZnSO 4 ) and were supplied with CaSiO 3 . Parameters related to Zn accumulation, N metabolism, and photosynthesis were measured. Zn stress affected leaf Zn concentration and reduced biomass in barley plants. Both Zn toxicity and deficiency inhibited N metabolism and enhanced photorespiration, increasing stress symptoms. CaSiO 3 mitigated Zn stress effects, probably regulating Zn levels in plant cells and enhancing N metabolism and photosynthesis. We conclude that CaSiO 3 could be beneficial to grow barley plants in soils with high or low availability of Zn.",

The beneficial effect on those processes was visible when seeds were soaked for 1 h in bacterial suspension and, especially, when the bacteria were present during Micro-Cel E conditioning. The main effect observed upon inoculation of seeds during priming was increased growth of lateral roots and more complex architecture of the branching root system. Treating seeds with A. rhizogenes simultaneously with Micro-Cel E priming as a carrier is a promising method of enhancing grass germination and seedlings growth, particularly by improving the root system development.",

Its applicability is demonstrated on selected experimental data extracted from available literature. Quantitative information about the “diffusion rate” (k 2) of the growth factors is obtained for two different model species in plant science: Arabidopsis thaliana L. belongs to the dicots and Zea mays L. belongs to the monocots. It is shown that the value of the diffusion rate may be useful in comparing different datasets and serve as a measure of reproducibility of standard measurements. Analysis of the formula and fits allows to identify and suggest a set of criteria for reporting future experiments, which would improve comparability and reproducibility of the results.",

    "abstract": "The studies focus on an ultrastructural analysis of the phenomenon of intercellular and systemic (vascular) transport of tobacco rattle virus (TRV) in tissues of the infected plants. TRV is a dangerous pathogen of cultivated and ornamental plants due to its wide range of plant hosts and continuous transmission by vectors—ectoparasitic nematodes. Two weeks after infection with the PSG strain of TRV, tobacco plants of the Samsun variety and potato plants of the Glada variety responded with spot surface necroses on inoculated leaf blades. Four weeks after the infection a typical systemic response was observed on tobacco and potato leaves, necroses on stems and lesions referred to as corky ringspot. Ultrastructural analysis revealed the presence of two types of TRV virions: capsidated and non-capsidated forms in tobacco and potato tissues. In the protoplast area, viral particles either occurred in a dispersed form or they formed organised inclusions of virions. We demonstrated for the first time the presence of non-capsidated-type TRV in the vicinity of and inside plasmodesmata. Capsidated particles of TRV were observed in intercellular spaces of the tissues of aboveground and underground organs. Expanded apoplast area was noted at the cell wall, with numerous dispersed non-capsidated-type TRV particles. These phenomena suggest active intercellular transport. Our ultrastructure studies showed for the first time that xylem can be a possible route of TRV systemic transport. We demonstrated that both capsidated and non-capsidated virions, of varied length, participate in long-distance transport. TRV virions were more often documented in xylem (tracheary elements and parenchyma) than in phloem. Non-capsidated TRV particles were observed inside tracheary elements in a dispersed form and in regular arrangements in potato and tobacco xylem. The presence of TRV virions inside the bordered pits was demonstrated in aboveground organs and in the root of the tested plants. We documented that both forms of TRV virions can be transported systemically via tracheary elements of xylem.",

It was shown that cold acclimation under a CO2 molar ratio of 800 μmol mol(air)−1 decreased the freezing tolerance of meadow fescue when compared to the ambient CO2 level. This effect was not related either to changes observed in PSII redox state or to photosynthetic acclimation to cold, which was in fact more effective at an elevated CO2 level. The decrease in freezing tolerance was linked to changes in the expression of CBF6 and LOS2 genes, whereas the protective effect on photosynthetic apparatus was connected with the activation of a non-photochemical mechanism of photoprotection as well as upregulation of FpCOR14b expression.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Modern agriculture must be subject to some adaptation processes due to unpredictable climate changes. One of the activities that enables the production of plant biomass in adverse climatic conditions is the development of ecological and innovative crop technologies using natural plant extracts. The elimination of synthetic fertilizers and their replacement with products based on organic matter will increase the plant’s resistance to negative conditions of environmental stress, will have a positive effect on the development and yielding of plants and will reduce cultivation costs. The plant material: willow ( Salix viminalis ), Jerusalem artichoke ( Helianthus tuberosus ) and Virginia mallow ( Sida hermaphrodita ). The natural extract was obtained from Navicula sp. (Bacillariophyceae) monocultures, which was applied to plants in three variants: watering, spraying (foliar application) and watering and spraying. Every 2 weeks: plant height and chlorophyll content index were determined and at the end of the growing season, an analysis was made of: fresh and dry biomass, gas exchange activity in plants (net photosynthesis, transpiration, stomatal conductivity and intercellular CO 2 concentration). The enzymatic activity of acid (pH = 6.0) and alkaline (pH = 7.5) phosphatase, RNase, dehydrogenases, as well as the integrity of cytoplasmic membranes was determined. The obtained results confirmed the positive effect of diatom monoculture extract on the growth and development of the plants. The analyzed physicochemical parameters were characterized by 15–20% higher values in comparison with the control. The use of natural extracts from Navicula sp. can be an alternative to chemical fertilizers and is considered one of the promising strategies in organic agriculture.",

In Arabidopsis thaliana six of these AMmonium Transporters (AMTs) are encoded by the genome. All of them show a unique expression pattern. While most AMTs are highly expressed in the root, AtAMT1;4 expression is limited to the pollen grains and the pollen tube. Here, we addressed the transport characteristics of AtAMT1;4 in the heterologous Xenopus laevis oocytes system. The transport saturated and showed high affinity for ammonium with a K m value lower than 10 µM. Based on our electrophysiological analysis, we classified AtAMT1;4 as a high affinity ammonium transporter.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs regulate gene expression by guiding the cleavage or attenuating the translation of target mRNAs. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the subset of class II TCP genes (plant-specific group of transcription factors) contains an miR319-binding site. One of them, AtTCP4, regulates negatively leaf growth and positively leaf senescence. In addition, miR319 targeting of TCP4 is critical for petal and stamen development and affects flowering time. The aim of this work was to identify the cDNA of InTCP4 gene and In-miR319 precursor in Ipomoea nil (Pharbitis nil). The cDNA sequence of InTCP4 shows a significant similarity to the cDNA members of the TCP family of other plant species and contains nucleotides complementary to miR319. The identified sequence In-pre-miR319 creates a long hairpin structure and mature miRNA sequence is located in a similar place as in precursors found in other plant species. Accumulation of InTCP4 mRNA and In-pre-miR319 was examined in various organs of I. nil plants. We found that the InTCP4 is strongly expressed in cotyledons of I. nil seedlings while the In-pre-miR319 accumulates mainly in the hypocotyls of seedlings. Moreover, we investigate the role of InTCP4 in the flowering induction, flower development and cotyledon senescence in I. nil. We indicate that the InTCP4 expression is controlled by both light/clock and miR319. Both InTCP4 and InMIR319 probably participate in the regulation of such processes as do their homologues in other plant species, the development of cotyledons, leaves and flower elements. The main function of InMIR319 seems to be the regulation of InTCP4 organ localization.",

The immunogold method demonstrated that microtubules and actin filaments of lipotubuloids might be connected with one another by myosin and kinesin. It was supposed that collaboration of motor proteins with actin filaments and microtubules makes autonomic high peripheral speed rotary motion of lipotubuloids in epidermis cells possible. Moreover, myosin was also detected in Golgi bodies in lipotubuloid. In lipotubuloids, the immunogold method demonstrated immunosignals after the use of an antibody to dynein light chains but spectroscopy mass analysis showed that in O. umbellatum epidermis lacked dynein heavy chains.",

    "abstract": "To identify potential candidates for acquiring stress tolerance, a new annealing control primer (ACP) system was used to identify the differentially expressed genes. Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) seedlings were exposed to various abiotic stresses such as cold (4°C for 6 h), heat (42°C for 6 h), salt (300 mM for 6 h), drought (withdrawing irrigation for 48 h), copper (500 μM for 6 h), cadmium (500 μM for 6 h), and arsenic (500 μM for 6 h). Primer sets 41 and 93 were differentially expressed and identified as same sequence, which represents a mitochondrial small heat-shock protein encoding gene, MsHsp23. This band was markedly increased or induced in alfalfa under heat, salt, and arsenic stresses. Differential expression of MsHsp23 was further evaluated by Northern blot analysis. Temporal expression analysis showed that mRNA pool was altered as early as 1 h of treatment. Thus, differential accumulation of MsHsp23 under heat, salt, and arsenic stresses suggests its potential involvement in diverse abiotic stress tolerance, and thereby making a target for further molecular analysis.",

    "abstract": "Forcing is a method that is usually used to induce flowering in plants, independent of the natural blooming period. The temperatures required to start blooming in lilac in November are ca. 37°C causing degeneration of flowers. Forcing at 15 °C in November requires 49 days to bloom as compared to 23 days for the standard 37 °C, but gives panicles of much better quality than those forced by standard method (37 °C). In this study, we have investigated the protein content, total protease activity, and cysteine protease activity at different stages of flowering (flower bud whitening and swelling, open flowers, wilted flowers) for lilac flowers (Syringa vulgaris L., fam. Oleaceae) blooming under three different conditions: natural conditions in May and forcing in a greenhouse in November at 37 °C (standard forcing) or at 15 °C (alternative forcing). The protein content was relatively constant during flowering for each of the three sets of conditions. Flowers from 15 °C had a significantly lower total protease and cysteine endoprotease activity than flowers from 37 °C at all stages. Flowers from plants blooming in May had a very time-specific cysteine protease activity, which was dramatically higher for the open flower stage than for the other stages. The partial coding sequence for a KDEL-CysEP was isolated, and its expression was determined by qRT-PCR. The gene expression did not correlate with the cysteine endoprotease activity especially in May natural flowering and November alternative forcing at 15 °C. Alternative forcing method at 15 °C affected the flowering process delaying senescence, presumably due to the low cysteine protease activity.",

In this paper, we focused on cotyledon senescence in Ipomoea nil and revealed that JAMe and darkness are the main factors stimulating the process examined. What is more, we showed that mefenamic acid (a jasmonate biosynthesis inhibitor) reverses the stimulatory effect of darkness on senescence. In plants growing under dark conditions, stimulation of JASMONIC ACID CARBOXYL METHYLTRANSFERASE (InJMT) expression and, consequently, an increase in JAMe content, have been observed. In turn, the level of jasmonic acid (JA) gradually decreased. Moreover, dark-grown seedlings demonstrated a lower PSII functional activity and a reduced chlorophyll content and autofluorescence. All of these data suggest that JAMe is a signal molecule controlling the senescence of cotyledons in I. nil.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Haloxylon ammodendron is a preferred shrub species for buffering against wind and fixing sand in arid sandy areas of northwest China. To determine whether sandstorms cause damage to H. ammodendron seedlings, we investigated the effects of wind-blown sands on the photosynthetic function of H. ammodendron by simulating sand-carrying wind in the wind tunnel. The results showed that photosystem II (PSII) non-photochemical quenching ( NPQ ) was sensitive to wind erosion, and sustained blowing of sand-carrying winds enhanced NPQ reduction. The rapidly relaxing quenching NPQ f made up the majority component of NPQ ; the NPQ f / NPQ ratio was approximately 64.4% in the sand-free wind group and nearly 56.2% in the sand-carrying wind group. The distribution of the quantum efficiency of the excitation energy indicated that the relative proportions of the quantum yield of PSII photochemistry Φ PSII , the quantum yield of quenching due to light-induced Φ NPQ , and non-light-induced Φ NO were influenced by both wind erosion and light intensity; the sand-carrying wind resulted in a relative decrease in Φ NPQ and a corresponding increase in Φ NO . The maximum quantum efficiency of PSII photochemistry F v / F m was relatively stable in the sand-free wind group, with an average value of approximately 0.81. Compared to sand-free wind, sand-carrying winds caused remarkable decreases in F v / F m . Light intensity was the main factor affecting Φ PSII , Φ NPQ , and relative electron transport rate ( rETR ); there was no interaction effect between the duration of sand-carrying wind and light intensity. Taken together, wind-blown sands cause irreversible damage to the photosynthesis of H. ammodendron seedlings, which is the main factor restricting population regeneration in shelterbelts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Organic amendments have been utilised as a source of nutrients to improve the growth and yield of many crops, including sweetpotato. However, none of the studies examined the relationship between organic amendments and the initiation of sweetpotato storage roots (SRs). A study was conducted in sweetpotato Orleans cultivar to investigate anatomical changes to roots during storage root formation aiming to elicit if organic amendment affects SR formation by changing soil available nitrogen (N) concentration. Two locally available organic amendments including poultry manure (PM) and sugarcane trash (SCT), were used in this experiment at different rates. Six treatments were included in the study: unamended soil (control), unamended soil with chemical fertiliser, PM 22 Mg/ha, PM 66 Mg/ha, SCT 10 Mg/ha and SCT 30 Mg/ha. Compared with unamended control, SCT application at both rates, 10 or 30 Mg ha −1 , significantly promoted the formation of SRs and reduced root lignification, while PM amendment from 22 to 66 Mg ha −1 significantly inhibited SR initiation and enhanced the formation of lignified roots, which appear to be associated to high soil available N caused by PM addition. During the SR initiation, all amended treatments increased N accumulation in plants compared to the control. These results indicated that excessive soil available N introduced by PM amendment could inhibit the formation of SR of sweetpotato. Thus, when applying a lower rate of PM to sweetpotato, and planting should be delayed from 2 to 3 weeks after amending to avoid the detrimental effect on SR initiation. Excessively high rates of PM soil amendment (66 Mg ha −1 ) should be avoided. A suitable rate of SCT may be applied (~ 10 Mg ha −1 in this study) to promote SR formation of sweetpotato in soil with adequate available N level, but high rates could lead to immobilisation of N and suppress crop growth.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Adventitious root formation is the key to successful propagation of olives through cuttings. Etiolation, as an eco-friendly practice, can modulate the plant’s endogenous phytohormone, which plays an important role in stimulation of rooting of cuttings. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the effect of etiolation on the rooting behavior of both ‘Manzanillo’ and ‘Picual’ olive cuttings (terminal and sub-terminal) treated with IBA (0, 4000 ppm). The results indicated that sub-terminal cuttings in both cultivars were more effective in olive propagation than terminal cuttings as they recorded increased leaves number, C/N ratio, total carbohydrates, total indoles, IAA, IAA/GA ratio, and total phenols. Etiolation of both olive cultivars for both terminal and sub-terminal cuttings significantly decreased rooting percent, roots number, IAA, and IAA/GA ratio; while, it increased GA and GA/IAA. Moreover, etiolation decreased total sugars, IAA, IAA/GA ratio, and indole/phenol ratio in both sub-terminal cuttings. Terminal ‘Manzanillo’ cuttings achieved a higher rooting percent than terminal ‘Picual’ cuttings by 5.83% and 202.2% as mean of both seasons for untreated and IBA-treated cuttings, which was accompanied by significant increase in vascular bundle%, total phenol, phenol/indole ratio, IAA, and IAA/GA ratio by 21.48%, 49.2%, 44.72%, 12.9%, and 22.9%, respectively. Also, terminal ‘Manzanillo’ cuttings recorded lower GA by 7.98% and GA/IAA ratio by 18.21% and pith by 6.13% than terminal ‘Picual’ cuttings. This study proved that olive plants need exposure to full sunlight to propagate easily by cuttings since etiolation had negative effects on IBA-treated cuttings.",

Extreme climatic conditions are becoming frequent worldwide, but despite their impact on plant productivity these weather events also modulate plants’ metabolism increasing the production of important phytocompounds. We aimed to characterize the physiological and metabolite adjustments in A. pavonina leaves induced by drought and UV-B radiation. Plants were exposed to drought (DS), UV-B radiation (UV-B), and drought + UV-B (DS + UV-B), and photosynthesis, lipophilic metabolites, and antioxidant status were evaluated. The stress conditions compromised the photosynthetic performance and induced oxidative stress (DS and UV-B plants). However, plants activated protective mechanisms (increased antioxidant activity and flavonoids in all treatments, total phenols in DS and DS + UV-B, and catechols in UV-B and DS + UV-B) and modulated their lipophilic profiles (accumulation of fatty acids and TCA cycle-related metabolites, and reduction of carbohydrates) to cope with the stress. We demonstrate for the first time that DS and UV-B radiation can enrich A. pavonina leaves with antioxidants and fatty acids increasing their medicinal value.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The thermal increase, due to the changed climatic context, is leading to marked variations in the yield and quality of the grapes and causing an increase in the use of water resources in several viticultural areas. Nevertheless, in some environments, rainfalls are scarce and there is no water availability. In this study, we compared the impact of low water irrigation volumes (DI, replacement of 70% of crop evapotranspiration) with respect to non-irrigated vines (NI), on the physiological, yield and qualitative performances of near-isohydric variety ‘Montepulciano’, trained to overhead trellis system, which requires a high-water supply. The stomatal conductance and photosynthesis values, in basal and median leaves, were higher in DI vines. All NI leaves suffered water stress, showing in the youngest leaves (position 20 and 25 along the main shoot) higher carbon isotope discrimination (δ 13 C) (− 25.38‰ and 25–25.77‰, respectively). At harvest, DI vines showed yield higher of 30% and 33% than NI vines in 2005 and 2006, respectively, and 18% in 2007. In environments with prolonged water shortage and low water resource, near-isohydric ‘Montepulciano’ vines, trained to overhead trellis system and irrigated with limited volumes, determined a significant improvement of ‘vineyard efficiency’ with a yield of 19.2 t/ha with respect to 13.4 t/ha of NI vines, ensuring also more sugar content (+ 31%), anthocyanin concentration (+ 13%) and polyphenolic substances (+ 8%) than NI vines.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Carob ( Ceratonia siliqua L.) is a relevant element of the Mediterranean spontaneous vegetation. Moreover, it is useful in reforestation, and it is currently re-valued for sustainable agriculture in dryland areas. However, the difficulties tied to carob propagation (mainly seed dormancy) hamper its large-scale cultivation. In this paper, the effects of four seed treatments (no treatment [control], soaking at 70 °C and 90 °C in water, or in 96% sulphuric acid) on five carob genotypes germination were studied. As compared to the very low germination of untreated seeds (0–13% germination), sulphuric acid (93–100% germination) and 90 °C water soaking (from 72 to &gt; 90% germination in four out the five genotypes) were effective in promoting germination. Soaking at 90 °C resulted in the leaching of a higher amount of total polyphenols from the genotypes seed coat as compared to soaking at 70 °C. A significant correlation (0.75**) was ascertained between polyphenol leaching of the different genotypes and germination. These results suggest that dormancy in this species is not primarily associated with seed coat hardness, as it is generally thought, but also with the release of polyphenols. Polyphenols determination of the dormant and the few non-dormant seeds of the different genotypes also seem to confirm this hypothesis since these last showed an almost halved total polyphenols content (on average 17.0) as compared to dormant ones (34.8 mg g −1 of seed FW). Further studies may determine the polyphenols involved, but also assess new, easier to carry out, seed treatments. The important role of the galactomannans on seed germination of carob is also discussed. Finally, similar studies may enhance the knowledge of dormancy processes in other Fabaceae species whose germination is positively affected by hot water treatments.",

The enzyme was purified 513-fold with a recovery of 8%. The molecular weight of the purified enzyme as determined by SDS-PAGE and gel filtration was approximately 60 kDa, and the enzyme appeared to be a monomer. Its pH and temperature optimum were pH 7.5 and 37°C, respectively. The enzyme prefers substrates with Phe at the N-terminus, although a high activity for substrates with N-terminal Tyr, Trp, Leu, and Met was also observed. The activity with Leu-β-naphthylamide was at least two times lower than that with Phe-β-naphthylamide (Phe-β-NA). The K m value for activity with Phe-β-NA was the lowest amongst the substrates tested, and it was 7.5 × 10−5 M. The activity of Phe-AP was not inhibited by EDTA, 1,10-phenanthroline and pepstatin A. The most effective inhibitors were pHMB and E-64, which modify sulphydryl groups; however, a significant inhibition in the presence of DFP and PMSF, both of which are serine protease inhibitors, was also observed. By applying mass spectrometry analysis, the peptides derived from the purified Phe-AP were assigned to amino acid sequences of the leucine aminopeptidases of N-type (LAPs-N).",

    "abstract": "Changes in activity of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), a key enzyme in lipid metabolism and signal network in defence mechanisms, were investigated in Solanum species and Phytophthora infestans interaction. We have compared PLA2 activity in response to an elicitor, a culture filtrate (CF) derived from P. infestans, in non-host resistant Solanum nigrum var. gigantea, field resistant S. tuberosum cv Bzura and susceptible S. tuberosum clone H-8105. To elucidate the contribution of specific forms of PLA2 to plant defence mechanism reasonably selective PLA2 inhibitors, haloenol lactone suicide substrate (HELSS) and p-bromophenacyl bromide (BPB), which discriminate between Ca+2-independent PLA2 (iPLA2) and Ca+2-dependent secretory PLA2 (sPLA2), were used. The in vivo and in vitro effects of the inhibitors on PLA2 activity and on generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by CF in the studied plants were assayed. We found that PLA2 activity increased in response to CF treatment, displaying various kinetics and intensity depending on the resistance status of a given genotype. Differences among the genotypes in the effects of each inhibitor on CF-induced PLA2 activity and on ROS production may reflect the diversity of PLA2 isoforms in plants. Contrary to BPB, the inhibitory effect of HELSS was observable mainly on CF-induced PLA2 activity, which suggests that iPLA2 participates in signal transduction in defence reactions. Various effects of the two inhibitors on PLA2 activity and ROS production suggest different contribution of sPLA2 and iPLA2 to modulation of defence reactions in the interaction between Solanum genotypes and P. infestans.",

    "abstract": "Plants growing under natural conditions are constantly exposed to various stress factors, which can restrain their productivity and limit yields. This paper deals with the effect of long- and short-term osmotic stress followed by recovery on the formation of polysomes and their stability during germination of pea (Pisum sativum L.) seeds. By isolating polysomes, it is possible to obtain an index which evidences the ability of tissues to synthesize proteins. Changes in the distribution of polysomes often precede measurable changes in amounts of proteins. Under osmotic stress, the dominant population of polysomes was the population of free polysomes (FP). The share of membrane-bound polysomes (MBP) and cytoskeleton-bound polysomes (CBP) and cytoskeleton-membrane-bound polysomes (CMBP) in the total fraction of ribosomes increased under intensive (−1.0 and −1.5 MPa) osmotic stress. These results can suggest that the bound forms of polysomes play an important role in the synthesis of stress proteins. In addition, the stability of polysomes isolated from pea early seedlings growing under unstressed control and osmotic stress conditions was tested. It turned out that polysomes formed under osmotic stress conditions (especially the CMBP) were more resistant to the activity of exogenous ribonucleases than the polysomes in the control samples. Under stress conditions it is highly likely that ribosomes become more densely packed on mRNA thus making it more resistant to ribonuclease. This is just one of the many mechanisms regulating stability of mRNA.",

Densitometric analysis of bands of respiratory chain complexes after one-dimensional blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) showed that levels and in-gel capacities of Complex I in leaf and root mitochondria were lower than those of the control. Two-dimensional BN/SDS-PAGE showed lower abundance of all Complex I subunits, but the qualitative structural composition (subunit expression and mobility) did not change. In mitochondria of S-deficient A. thaliana, impairment of Complex I could be compensated to some extent by additional type II NADH dehydrogenases that do not contain iron–sulphur clusters. The level and capacity of external NADH dehydrogenases in leaf and root mitochondria was higher under S deficiency, but that of internal NADH dehydrogenases did not differ from the control. The amount of COXII (mitochondrial-encoded subunit of cytochrome c oxidase in Complex IV; EC 1.9.3.1) and the capacity of Complex IV were lower under S deficiency, but levels of alternative oxidase, a bypass to Complex IV, did not change. We discuss S deficiency in A. thaliana in relation to the assembly and stability of Complex I and to a bypass of Complex I by external type II NADH dehydrogenases.",

    "abstract": "Starch granule size distributions in plant tissues, when determined in high resolution and specified properly as a frequency function, could provide useful information on the granule formation and growth. To better understand genetic control of physical properties of starch granules, we attempted a new approach to analyze developmental and genotypic effects on morphology and size distributions of starch granules in sweetpotato storage roots. Starch granules in sweetpotatoes exhibited low sphericity, many shapes that appeared to be independent of genotypes or developmental stages, and non-randomly distributed sizes. Granule size distributions of sweetpotato starches were determined in high resolution as differential volume-percentage distributions of volume-equivalent spherical diameters, rigorously curve-fitted to be lognormal, and specified using their geometric means $$\\bar{x}^{*}$$ and multiplicative standard deviations $$s^{*}$$ in a $$\\bar{x}^{*} \\times /({\\text{multiply/divide}})s^{*}$$ form. The scale ( $$\\bar{x}^{*}$$ ) and shape ( $$\\bar{s}^{*}$$ ) of these distributions were independently variable, ranging from 14.02 to 19.36 μm and 1.403 to 1.567, respectively, among 22 cultivars/clones. The shape ( $$s^{*}$$ ) of granule lognormal volume-size distributions of sweetpotato starch were found to be highly significantly and inversely correlated with their apparent amylose contents. More importantly, granule lognormal volume-size distributions of starches in developing sweetpotatoes displayed the same self-preserving kinetics, i.e., preserving the shape but shifting upward the scale, as those of particles undergoing agglomeration, which strongly indicated involvement of agglomeration in the formation and growth of starch granules. Furthermore, QTL analysis of a segregating null allele at one of three homoeologous starch synthase II loci in a reciprocal-cross population, which was identified through profiling starch granule-bound proteins in sweetpotatoes of diverse genotypes, showed that the locus is a QTL modulating the scale of granule volume-size distributions of starch in sweetpotatoes.",

    "abstract": "Experiments were carried out on transformation of leaf explants derived from the axenic culture of Gentiana tibetica (King) using a co-culture of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. A. tumefaciens octopine strain C58C1 carried neomycine phosphotransferase (nptII) and β-glucuronidase (uidA) genes. The influence of plasmid helper pCH32 on transformation efficiency was stressed. After co-cultivation, explant was cultured on three different regeneration media (RM1-3) at the presence of the timentin and callus formation and plants regeneration occurred. The transgenic character of the selected tissue and transformants T0 in the presence of kanamycin has been confirmed by the histo-chemical analysis of reporter enzyme activity (ß-glucuronidase), polymerase chain reaction, and southern hybridization detecting uidA and nptII genes. l-glutamine used during inoculation period had a significant influence on the transformation efficiency in relation to its concentration and time of treatment.",

    "abstract": "NB-ARC proteins are critical to effector-triggered immunity and play important roles in effector recognition and signal transduction in healthy plant growth. However, their primary protein traits, functions and roles remain incompletely understood in Rehmannia glutinosa. Here, we identified 45 NB-ARC protein sequences from the protein sequence sets and transcriptome of R. glutinosa. The CC type was the main one, accounting for 84.44% of these sequences. The most conserved motif was a 288 aa ADP-binding sequence. This motif belongs to the disease-resistance proteins. Differential expression of 36 expressed NB-ARC genes revealed that NB-ARC genes were rarely expressed 30 days after planting and were frequently expressed approximately 60 days after planting. To further understand the function of NB-ARC in replanted R. glutinosa, the genes encoding NB-ARC domains were profiled using qRT-PCR under the different stress states involved in the formation of consecutive monoculture problems. The results showed that NB-ARC genes might play a role in the formation of R. glutinosa consecutive monoculture problems. This study is the first to identify NB-ARC genes in R. glutinosa and to reveal their roles in consecutive monoculture problems in R. glutinosa. These findings provide insights into the mechanism of formation of consecutive monoculture problems.",

    "abstract": "The expression of two genes encoding xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases (XTHs), Cs-XTH1 and Cs-XTH3, was upregulated during the onset of cucumber somatic embryogenesis. As a means of characterising the developmental regulation of these genes, the activity of the respective upstream regulatory regions was investigated in seedlings and somatic embryos of Arabidopsis thaliana and Cucumis sativus. GUS assays revealed that both genes are under developmental control. In addition, elevated promoter activity was found in the tension-bearing regions of the plant and in response to touch and wounding, which is consistent with the existence of numerous stress-related cis elements in the 5′-regulatory regions. In vivo xyloglucan endotransglucosylase (XET) action assays were performed to gain an overview on the role of XTHs during somatic embryogenesis. The highest XET action was observed in the external cell layers of somatic embryos in the cotyledonary region and in the presumptive region of peg formation. Based on the results, we propose a dual mechanism (one developmental and the second adaptive) for the regulation of Cs-XTH1 and Cs-XTH3 activity wherein the developmental pattern can be modified by mechanical stimuli.",

    "abstract": "UV exposure is harmful to plants. Increasing resistance against UV light is thus of great importance to their growth. Para-Aminobenzoic acid (PABA) has major roles in many biological processes, involving nucleotide biosynthesis, DNA repair, and DNA methylation, which contributed to UV irradiation. However, no study reports the effect of PABA on UV tolerance, or details of the underlying molecular mechanisms are explored. Hence, the objective of the research is to study the protective effect of PABA on UV in Arabidopsis and explored the molecular mechanisms. We overexpressed PABA synthase gene (Pabs) from Mushroom Agaricus bisporus in Arabidopsis and observed reduced root growth and UV-C hyposensitivity exposed to 2500 J m−2 UV-C light. UV-C-induced DNA damage was significantly reduced and the expression of decreased DNA methylation 1 (DDM1) was remarkably higher in the Pabs lines, suggesting that overexpression of Pabs may protect against UV-induced DNA damage. In addition, overexpression of Pabs leads to an elevated reactive oxygen species production at root tips and enhanced catalase and superoxide dismutase activity, which may correlate with the enhanced UV tolerance of the Pabs overexpression lines. In summary, overexpression of Pabs from A. bisporus enhances UV-C tolerance of Arabidopsis, suggesting that Pabs takes an important part in defence against DNA damage.",

    "abstract": "The influence of exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) on the content of free polysomes (FP), membrane-bound polysomes (MBP), cytoskeleton-bound polysomes (CBP) and cytomatrix-bound polysomes (CMBP) in triticale germs as well as in vitro protein synthesis by these four polysomal fractions were studied. During translation, proteins were biotinylated for chemiluminescence detection. We have found that ABA changed both the content of FP, MBP, CMP and CMBP in germ tissue, and their subsequent translation activity. At 100 μM ABA, the content of FP and MBP was over fourfold lower compared to the control, whereas the amounts of CBP and CMBP were about two- and threefold higher, respectively. Moreover, the estimation of the share of polysomes in each ribosomal fraction (sub-units, monosomes, polysomes) showed that, at 100 μM ABA, cytomatrix-bound polysomes, which constituted 90% of polysomes, were the predominant class in ABA-treated germs while membrane-bound polysomes, which made up 82% of polysomes, dominated in the control. A high level of CMBP in ABA-treated tissues may indicate that this class of polysomes participates in ABA-induced synthesis of proteins. In turn, the inhibition of MBP under ABA-treatment is probably due to the delayed protein synthesis which takes place on these polysomes. We identified two lysine-containing proteins synthesized on both of the above classes of polysomes, whose synthesis was altered due to ABA application. Synthesis of a 47 kDa protein on MBP was inhibited, while synthesis of a 79 kDa protein on CMBP is strongly enhanced by ABA influence. The importance of these findings is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Genome-editing tools from Oligonucleotide-Directed Mutagenesis (ODM) to CRISPR system use synthetic oligonucleotides for targeted exchange of nucleotides. Presently, majority of genome-editing protocols are dependent on the in vitro cell or tissue culture systems with somaclonal variation, and limitations in plant regeneration. Therefore, here, we report an alternative in planta cellular test system for optimization of the ODM, based on the injection of oligonucleotide solution into the apical meristematic region of haploid maize seedlings. Using 5′-fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotides, we detected accumulation of synthetic DNA molecules in cells of the shoot apical meristem and of the vascular bundles of leaf primordia. For silencing or knocking down of the phytoene desaturase gene in somatic cells, 41-mer long single-stranded oligonucleotides with TAG stop codon were injected into maize seedlings. We detected out-growing M1 plantlets that developed leaves with white stripes or pale-green color. Confocal microscopy of white stripes showed that in addition to the chlorophyll fluorescence-deficient tissue region, chlorophyll containing cells are present in white stripes. The Ion Torrent sequencing of DNA samples from the white stripes indicated 0.13–1.50% read frequency for the TAG stop codon in the phytoene desaturase gene. Appearance of chlorotic abnormalities supports the mutagenic nature of oligonucleotide molecules after injection into the shoot apical meristem region of maize seedling. The described protocol provides basis for early seedling stage characterization of functionality of a mutagenic oligonucleotide with different chemistry and testing efficiency of various treatment combinations at plant level.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The gases used: ethylene (C 2 H 4 ), hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and nitric oxide (NO) showed a high activity as inductors of germination in primary dormant or non-dormant seeds exposed to stress or suboptimal temperatures. So far, research on the role of ethylene, hydrogen cyanide and nitric oxide has involved these gases during seed germination. This work describes gas-priming as a novel method for treating air dry seeds of the genus Amaranthus serving as a model. Effects of C 2 H 4 , HCN or NO applied to dry seeds were similar to those obtained when the gases were used during seed germination for an identical period of time. Application of the gases to air dry seeds presents a new opportunity to study the role of those gases in germination of dormant and non-dormant seeds and to constrain effects of the gases from time 0. The prolonged treatment time for dry seeds (24 h) is convenient because if the treatment is started in the morning, there is sufficient time the next day for further experiments to begin, e.g. germination test in water or in solutions of other compounds. Moreover, it is important that the gas-treated seeds can be stored or transported prior to use. The gas-priming method allows to prepare treated seed samples which can be used in experiments either immediately or after storage in open air or in a closed container. Gas-priming with C 2 H 4 , HCN and NO is a simple and useful treatment of air-dried seeds, which opens up new useful possibilities for basic research on the role of those gases in releasing dormancy and seed germination of various plant species. In addition, the method may prove very useful in horticulture and agriculture in improving germination of gas-sensitive seeds.",

    "abstract": "The enrichment with antioxidants (glutathione or ascorbate) or prooxidants (alloxan, methylviologen, hydrogen peroxide) of root inducing medium significantly decreased rhizogenesis frequency (alloxan, hydrogen peroxide) or inhibited roots regeneration (ascorbate, methylviologen) during the in vitro culture of Mesembryanthemum crystallinum L. hypocotyls. The adventitious roots morphology, root hairs length and density, was also influenced. Changes in the rhizogenesis course were related to the differences in hydrogen peroxide concentration during following days of culture between explants exhibiting morphogenic potential and those without the ability to form adventitious roots. In explants with morphogenic potential, rhizogenesis induction was always accompanied by a high level of hydrogen peroxide followed by the decrease in H2O2 content in following days. In contrast, in the explants without regeneration potential, the level of hydrogen peroxide was increasing during the culture period. Activity patterns of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and guaiacol peroxidase (POX) in the following days of culture were similar in the explants exhibiting regeneration potential cultured on different media. Total activity of SOD decreased during initial days of culture and then increased due to the activation of additional SOD isoform described as MnSODII. The activity of POX was low during the rhizogenesis induction, and then increased during following days of culture; the increase was correlated with the decrease in hydrogen peroxide content. In the explants without the ability to regenerate roots, the total activity of SOD was low throughout the whole culture period, whereas the POX activity was significantly higher than in hypocotyls with regeneration potential. It might be concluded that the increase in hydrogen peroxide during initial stages of rhizogenesis and the induction of MnSODII are prerequisites for adventitious roots formation from hypocotyls of M. crystallinum, independently in the presence of anti- or prooxidant in the culture medium.",

    "abstract": "Leaf senescence is associated with changes in proteomics. In this study, to quantitatively analyze changes in protein abundance related to leaf senescence in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), we employed a proteomic approach utilizing iTRAQ and physiological assays throughout the senescence of leaf tissue in cotton grown under typical field conditions. Physiological tests showed leaf chlorophyll content and photosynthetic rates decreased significantly throughout the aging process. A total of 195 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) throughout leaf senescence were identified by mass spectrometry. Of these, 91 (47%) proteins were upregulated, while the remaining 104 (53%) were downregulated. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses indicated that the expression of genes in several pathways potentially associated with aging changed throughout senescence, including metabolic pathways, photosynthesis, pyruvate metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, and diterpenoid biosynthesis. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of aging in plants as well as fundamental data describing leaf senescence in cotton.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this study, aqueous extracts of Calliandra haematocephala Hassk. leaves and inflorescences were tested on seeds of quinoa ( Chenopodium album L.) and rice ( Oryza sativa L.), and on some of the most noxious-associated weeds, Chenopodium album L. and Holcus lanatus L. in quinoa, and Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P. Beauv., Echinochloa colona L., Eclipta prostrata L. and Rottboellia cochinchinensis (Lou.) W.D. Clayton in rice. The objectives were to identify extract concentrations at which 50 and 90% of germination (GR $$_{[50,90]}$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:msub><mml:mrow /><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mn>50</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>90</mml:mn><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math> ) and radicle elongation (RR $$_{[50,90]}$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:msub><mml:mrow /><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mn>50</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>90</mml:mn><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math> ) were inhibited, to fractionate inflorescence extracts for facilitating identifying the chemical group causing allelopathic effects, and to evaluate the fraction showing the stronger weed suppression effects and the least crop damage. Increasing extract concentration rates (0, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 100% crude extract) were applied to seeds of target crops and weeds. Flower extracts at rates $$&lt; 0.30$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.30</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math> produced GR $$_{[50]}$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:msub><mml:mrow /><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mn>50</mml:mn><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math> and RR $$_{[50]}$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:msub><mml:mrow /><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mn>50</mml:mn><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math> on H. lanatus , and GR $$_{[90]}$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:msub><mml:mrow /><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mn>90</mml:mn><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math> and RR $$_{[90]}$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:msub><mml:mrow /><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mn>90</mml:mn><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math> in C. album , while quinoa seeds were not affected. Rice and its target weeds were minimally affected by flower extracts, whereas radicle elongation of all species was significantly reduced.

Fractions were quantitatively and qualitatively analysed to detect phytochemical groups, using specific chemical reagents and thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The fraction F3 from aqueous flower extract showed a high content of flavonoids, assumed as the potential allelochemical substance. Total flavonoid content in F3 was quantified as 2.7 mg of quercetin per g F3, i.e. , 12.8 mg of quercetin per g of inflorescence material. Additionally, field equivalent extract rates obtained from the harvested fresh inflorescence biomass could be determined. These rates ranged between 90 and 143 mL l −1 of F3 aqueous fraction, while for ethanol F3 were 131 mL l −1 . Our results are encouraging for finding sustainable and ecologically friendly alternatives for weed management in crops of high nutritional value, contributing also to counteract the growing problem of herbicide resistance.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, we have demonstrated that membrane-free extracts of etiolated shoots of Phaseolus coccineus seedlings show tocopherol oxidase activity. For this reaction, presence of membrane lipids, such as lecithin and mixture of plant lipids was required. The rate of the reaction was the highest for α-tocopherol and decreased in the order α ≫ β > γ > δ tocopherols. In the case of α-tocopherol, the main oxidation product was α-tocopherolquinone, while for the other tocopherol homologues the dominant products were other derivatives. When the enzyme activity was measured in leaves, hypocotyls and roots of etiolated seedlings of P. coccineus, the oxidase activity was the highest in extracts of leaves and decreased towards the roots where no activity was detected. The effect of hydrogen peroxide and of different inhibitors on the reaction suggest that tocopherol oxidase does not belong to peroxidases or flavin oxidases but rather to multi-copper oxidases, such as polyphenol oxidases or laccases. On the other hand, catechol, the well-known substrate of polyphenol oxidases and laccases, was not oxidized by the enzyme, indicating a high substrate specificity of the tocopherol oxidase.",

    "abstract": "Abstract An intentional or inadvertent mixing of plant materials containing ephedrine alkaloids, especially Ephedra , is illegal. In order to better detect plant materials containing ephedrine alkaloids in export and smuggling, DNA barcoding combined with a TaqMan real-time PCR-based assay were used in this study. We collected 201 samples from 18 species belonging to four genera distributed in three families to amplify two barcoding markers, internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) and psb A -trn H. 175 ITS2 sequences and 136 psb A- trn H sequences were obtained. Alignments and the neighbor-joining tree indicated that ITS2 showed a better discrimination of species than psb A -trn H. In addition, based on the sequence comparison of the ITS2 region from 18 species, three sets of primer/probes were designed using the real-time PCR assay platform. A sensitivity test showed the above primer/probe sets were specific and sensitive (as little as 0.0050 ng/μL target DNA) to identify species containing ephedrine alkaloids. Hence, the combination of novel DNA barcoding and the TaqMan real-time PCR-based technique are promising tools for the identification of plant materials containing ephedrine alkaloids. It is beneficial to standardize market circulation and detection of plant materials containing ephedrine alkaloids.",

    "abstract": "A natural feature of freshly harvested Avena fatua L. caryopses is primary dormancy which, however, was relieved partially by putrescine (Put) (10−2 M) and completely by karrikinolide (KAR1) (3 × 10−9 M) or gibberellic acid (GA3) (10−5 M). The sensitivity of A. fatua caryopses to these stimulators was adversely affected by supraoptimal temperature (SOT) (30 °C). A reduced germinability of caryopses due to high temperature even after transferring them to lower temperatures (10 or 20 °C) indicated the induction of thermodormancy. The maintenance of relatively constant levels of abscisic acid (ABA) in embryos but not surrounding tissues during SOT treatment was observed. The application of Put either during the SOT treatment or afterwards counteracted the effects of high temperature but had no significant impact on ABA content. The action of exogenous Put in alleviating the loss of responsiveness to KAR1 and GA3 imposed by SOT treatment in A. fatua PD caryopses is discussed in reference to the interconnection between ABA and GA metabolism and signaling pathways.",

    "abstract": "Gamma secretase is a multi-subunit complex with aspartic intramembrane protease activity that is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease in humans. In Arabidopsis thaliana, γ-secretase subunits are localized to endomembrane system compartments and interact with each other in a similar manner to their human counterparts. Here, we identified the protein partners of two plant γ-secretase subunits, presenilin 2 and PEN-2, by tandem affinity purification and co-immunoprecipitation, respectively. Integral membrane proteins were found to interact with presenilin 2, whereas secreted proteins were found to interact with PEN-2. Microscopy screening revealed that the reticulon family protein, RTNLB1, and two single transmembrane domain proteins, TIR-X and the phytolongin PHYL1.1, interact with presenilins. Finally, we show that RTNLB1 interacts with TIR-X. These results represent a step toward elucidating the functions of γ-secretase subunits in plant cells.",

    "abstract": "Submersed Callitriche cophocarpa is an outstanding Cr phytoremediator in water systems. The mineral elements in waters can penetrate the submersed plant surface. This has led us to the hypothesis that the absorbed Cr can alter the mechanical properties of leaves. These properties were measured by applying atomic force microscopy. C. cophocarpa shoots were immersed in 100 µM (5.2 mg/l) Cr solution for 7 days. Cr was applied independently at two distinct oxidation states as Cr(VI) and Cr(III), known from different physicochemical properties and toxic effects. The contents of elements which were proportional to the fluorescence signal in individual leaves were evaluated using micro-X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. The results obtained showed that the leaf epidermis significantly changes its elastic properties upon incubation with Cr-supplemented solution. When compared to the control, a drop in the leaf's stiffness observed for Cr(III) was ca. 42 %. In the case of Cr(VI)-treated leaves, the stiffness raised to ca. 17 %. The changes in elasticity were significantly correlated with the contents of Ca (Pearson's coefficient r = 0.87, p < 0.017). The results led us to ascertain that it is Cr(III) but not Cr(VI) that significantly influences Ca removal from leaves thus decreasing the stiffness of the leaf's epidermis.",

    "abstract": "Abiotic stress factors such as extreme temperatures or osmotic stress are among the major causes of inferior crop yields. In response to a stress, plants have evolved various defense mechanisms. In our study, we have demonstrated how cold stress, osmotic stress and a combination of both stresses retard the growth of roots and inhibit the process of ribosomes binding into polysomes. The tested stresses also limited the ability of root tissues to synthesize proteins. At the same time, most of the analyzed samples were found to contain elevated shares of the fractions of cytoskeleton-bound polysomes (CBP, CMBP) in the total population of polysomes. Using a polysome-based degradation system, it was shown that polysomes formed under stress conditions were much more resistant to the effect of exogenous ribonuclease than the control ones. The highest tolerance to digestion was demonstrated by the cytoskeleton-bound (CBP) and cytoskeleton-membrane bound polysomes (CMBP). The increasing share of CBP and their stability in roots of seeds germinating under stress conditions can be a target for physiological regulation. It seems that modifications in the stability and percentages of particular polysomal populations play an important role in the adaptation of plants to stress conditions, which may indicate that these forms of polysomes, i.e., cytoskeleton-bound ones, are involved (via selective translation) in the synthesis of stress proteins in soybean roots.",

    "abstract": "Regardless of the DNA replication stress induced by low concentration of hydroxyurea (HU), root apical meristem cells of Allium cepa keep growing, and some of them override the DNA damage checkpoint mechanisms initiating either premature or an abnormal mitotic chromosome condensation. Prolonged incubation of onion seedlings with HU results in an increased level of immunodetectable proteins sharing epitopes with SUN2, one of the highly conserved elements linking nuclear envelope (NE) to the cyto- and nucleoskeletal structures. In addition to NE, phragmoplast and cell plate, our observations extend an array of subcellular compartments at which SUN2-like proteins (SUN2-LPs) are localized. These include cortical preprophase band of microtubules, centromeric regions of ana- and telophase chromosomes, and nuclear bodies (SUN2-NBs) polarly localized in interphase nuclei according to Rabl's configuration. SUN2-NBs (distinct from fibrillarin-rich Cajal bodies) colocalize with late-replicating areas of heterochromatin and are thought to represent clustered centromeres. Three-dimensional spatial analysis of SUN2-NBs suggests their connections with NE. An enhanced expression and additional localization sites of SUN2-LPs may be correlated with a considerable reprogramming of cellular functions triggered in response to prolonged HU treatment.",

    "abstract": "The influence of short and long day length on the expression of qualitative and quantitative resistance to Phytophthora infestans in potato was studied. The incompatible interaction was tested for available set of isolates avirulent in greenhouse conditions to potato Black’s differentials possessing the genes: R2, R5, R6, R8, R9, R10, and standard potato cultivar Tarpan (no known R gene). The avirulent isolates either were completely avirulent regardless of plant growing conditions, or they infected leaflets of these differentials more frequently when plants were exposed previously to short day conditions than to long day conditions. This study highlights the importance of day length, among many other factors which are controlled, in testing the expression of the virulence of P. infestans isolates. In compatible interactions, when quantitative resistance was evaluated in differentials with gene R1, R3, R4, R7, R11, and potato cultivar Craigs Royal (no known R gene), stronger infection expressed by lesion growth rate, as well as stronger sporulation, were observed on potato leaflets of plants exposed to short day for 6–7 weeks before inoculation. The analysis of variance revealed a significant contribution to variation in lesion growth rate of day length, genotype, as well as day length by genotype interaction. Significant influence of isolate, and genotype, but not day length, on the expression of the incubation period was found. The results indicate the necessity of evaluating components of partial resistance present in potato lines used in breeding potato resistant to P. infestans in destined day length growing conditions.",

In the current study, we examined the localization of PR (L1–L6) proteins, belonging to the PR-10 class family, in the root tips of yellow lupine seedlings using histo- and cytochemical methods. Immunohistochemical localization revealed the presence of PR-proteins in all examined yellow lupine root tip tissue, and lead treatment did not change the distribution of proteins in the roots. However, the metal induced a significant increase in the accumulation of PR-proteins in the meristematic cells and procambium tissue. An immunocytochemical approach with immunogold method demonstrated the cytoplasmic nature of the PR-proteins and their increased accumulation after copper treatment. The results confirmed the affiliation of PR (L1–L6) to PR-10 class family proteins, as well as their intracellular localization.",

    "abstract": "Rumex tianschanicus × Rumex patientia is a high-biomass-yielding plant suitable for fuel and biogas production. The protocol of the hybrid sorrel micropropagation was used to study the changes in the photosystem II (PSII) activity as well as to analyse the ultrastructure of the chloroplasts. The lowest effective PSII quantum yield [Y(II)] and an apparent electron transport rate of PSII [ETR(II)] were observed for adventitious shoots that had been regenerated in vitro, before rooting. These fluorescence parameters were higher and similar for both the leaves of the same adventitious shoots that had been rooted under in vitro conditions and for the shoots that had been acclimated and grown in ex vitro conditions. The analysis indicated that the PSII activity strongly depends on the formation of properly functioning roots and that in vitro or ex vitro culture conditions are, at least to some degree, less important. TEM analysis revealed that chloroplasts from plants rooted in vitro were sufficiently mature and acclimatization processes have less impact on their development. This is the first report concerning the analysis of PSII activity and the ultrastructure of the chloroplasts at all of the stages of micropropagation, i.e. adventitious shoot formation in vitro, rooting in vitro and acclimation to ex vitro conditions. It strongly indicated that rooting under in vitro conditions, rather than the acclimation to ex vitro conditions, plays a key role in the development of a completely functional photosynthetic apparatus in hybrid sorrel.",

    "abstract": "A Monte Carlo simulation was used to determine the dependence between the thickness of the cuticle layer of coleoptiles and the spectra of the H+ ions (i.e., protons) passing through this layer, which is treated as a potential barrier. The apparently simplistic model of a walled cylinder filled with H+ ions propagating through the cuticle layer was solved in silico. We showed that the thickness of the cuticle layer clearly influences the intensity of the efflux of protons, which changes the pH of the surrounding solution. Then, diffusion and cross-correlation data for maize (Zea mays L.) coleoptile growth and H+ ion extrusion were probed in an experiment and compared with the Monte Carlo computation results. Ex vivo experiments for the control (APW), auxin (IAA) and fusicoccin (FC) were conducted. The transition from time-delayed pH—(abrasion time) cross-correlation to proton efflux that was not retarded was obtained, thus confirming the canvas that constitutes the acid growth hypothesis and the rationale that was accepted for the derivation of the ‘equation of state’ for plants.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Maturity is an important factor in regulating seed vigor, while inappropriate harvest date affects seed vigor seriously. Here we reported that the seed vigor was the highest among 25–28 days after pollination, and these days were the best harvest time for sunflower seeds. Seed moisture content increased first and then decreased, while seed dry weight increased continuously with the advancement of seed development. Oil and protein are the main nutriments in mature sunflower seeds and changes in both contents were consistent with the seed dry weight. For antioxidases, the activity of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) was decreased gradually before seed maturity. Compared to gibberellin (GA), whose content decreased, abscisic acid (ABA) accumulated first and then decreased during the seed development. Moreover, the content of spermidine (Spd) increased continually, although no regularity of variation was found in putrescine (Put) and spermine (Spm). Further analysis showed that the activities of GA3ox and GA20ox, NCED and ABA8ox, SAMDC and SPDS and corresponding genes expression resulted in changes of GA, ABA and Spd accumulation, respectively. In addition, seed moisture, soluble sugar, GA, ABA content and APX activity were significantly negatively correlated with seed vigor indexes, while seed dry weight, oil, protein and Spd content were significantly positively correlated with seed vigor indexes. These metabolic processes may be closely related to seed vigor formation, and can be used to predict seed vigor.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Biostimulants, including phytohormones, are of high agricultural importance. Thus far, several methods have been developed for phytohormone detection/determination in microalgal cultures. Most of them require expensive, state-of-the-art machinery which often has limited availability in developing, agricultural countries. The main goal of our study was to develop a cheap and straightforward method for brassinosteroid determination in microalgal cultures. We used a Klebsormidium strain whose genus members have reportedly high brassinosteroid content. Using brassinolide standard, we compared the response of four different rice cultivars in a rice lamina inclination bioassay (RLIA), and from these found the variety ‘Koshihikari’ the most suitable one. A dynamic response over a broad concentration range from 0.001 to 0.1 mg/L brassinolide concentration was observed. Attempts with commonly used mechanical methods for disrupting Klebsormidium cells resulted in only negligible brassinolide release, while methanolic extraction liberated almost all cellular brassinosteroids. To overcome the negative effect of methanol on rice lamina inclination, solid-phase extraction was applied to get rid of methanol from the assay. The estimated brassinolide concentration in Klebsormidium culture by RLIA was validated using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS).",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ethylene management and manipulating storage conditions are crucial elements that impact the postharvest quality of apple fruit. This study demonstrated the optimal approach for preserving the quality of ‘Cripps Pink’ apple fruit during storage by minimizing ethylene production and action, respiration rate, physiological loss of weight (PLW), and textural changes. Ethylene antagonist treatment had the greatest impact on suppressing ethylene and respiration peaks, while storage duration notably influenced fruit firmness and PLW. Fumigation treatment with 1-methylcyclopropene (MCP), 1 H -cyclopropabenzene (BC), and 1 H -cyclopropa[ b ]naphthalene (NC) effectively reduced ethylene and respiration peaks. Storage conditions (cold, controlled atmosphere, and photocatalytic oxidation) affected ethylene production and respiration, with ozonized storage showing higher rates. Prolonged storage led to increased PLW, ethylene production, and decreased fruit firmness. The most effective treatment combination for ethylene action antagonism and maintaining fruit quality was MCP treatment in ozonized cold storage for 120 d.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The regeneration from embryogenic callus of higher plants in tissue culture is regulated by explants types and developmental stage and also regulated by some genes. In Miscanthus lutarioriparius , five candidate genes were selected to decide the differential expression between embryogenic and non-embryogenic calli, including MlARF-GEP (guanine nucleotide-exchange protein of ADP ribosylation factor), MlKHCP (kinesin heavy chain like protein), MlSERK1 (somatic embryogenesis receptor-like kinases 1), MlSERK2 (somatic embryogenesis reportor-like kinases 2), and MlTypA (tyrosine phosphorylation protein A) with Genbank accession numbers KU640196–KU640200. Multiple sequence alignment analysis showed that five genes were highly conserved among members of their gene families respectively. Phylogenetic relationship analysis showed that five genes were closest with homologous genes of Zea mays and Sorghum . The qRT-PCR results showed significant differences of five genes expression pattern between two different callus types, the relative expression in embryogenic callus was detected to exceed in non-embryogenic callus. Furthermore, simple sequence repeats (SSR) marker statistics results via Chi-square showed a significant correlation between MlSERK1 genotype and induction of embryogenic callus in M. lutarioriparius . This study may lay the foundation of the molecular mechanism on the embryogenic callus induction of M. lutarioriparius and perhaps provide some gist for further study on genetic manipulation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this study, two poplar varieties with different resistance to sulfur dioxide were selected for a comparative experiment. SO 2 fumigation to the poplars was carried out under controlled conditions to determine the variation in the activity of enzymes, the content of metabolites and the expression of enzymes genes in pathways of sulfur metabolism in plants. The results showed that the activity of enzymes and the content of sulfur metabolites were closely related to the response of the poplars to SO 2 stress. Populus × euramericana cv. 'Purui' had two ways of detoxification: oxidation detoxification, oxidizing sulfite (SO 3 2− ) to sulfate SO 4 2− by sulfite oxidase; reductive detoxification, SO 3 2− being reduced to S 2− by sulfite reductase (SiR). Moreover, OASTL and SAT activity, and levels of cysteine (CYS) and glutathione (GSH) also increased in P. × euramericana cv. 'Purui' in response to SO 2 fumigation, and the gene expression encoding Glutathione S-transferases (GST), and some enzymes in cysteine and methionine metabolism was up-regulated. For Populus × euramericana cv. '74/76' with weaker resistance to sulfur dioxide, it only detoxified by increasing the activity of SiR, and but down-regulated the expression of gene encoding 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate synthase (PAPSS), which could affect the consumption of sulfite in the exposure to SO 2 . Thus, the SO 2 -resistant difference of the two poplar varieties is mainly attributed to variation in activity of the enzymes and content of their metabolites in pathways of sulfur metabolism, and gene expression of some enzymes in cysteine and methionine metabolism also plays a role in the resistant difference.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this work, the responses of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh to trans -aconitic acid (TAA) were investigated. A. thaliana was grown in the presence of TAA in a concentration range of 400–1200 µM for 7 or 15 days. Changes in the morphoanatomy, cellular ultrastructure, and micromorphology of the roots were evaluated by light and transmission electron (TEM) microscopy. At concentrations below 1000 µM, TAA reduced the length of the primary roots, but induced an early appearance of lateral roots and root hairs. At a concentration of 1200 µM, TAA suppressed the growth of seedlings. The images of longitudinal sections of root tips of seedlings treated with IC 50 of TAA (684 µM) revealed a reduced elongation zone with an increased differentiation zone. TEM images showed an increase in the number and volume of vacuoles, an increase in vesicles containing electron-dense material derived from plasmalemma, and electron-dense granules attached to the cell wall. Trans -aconitic acid induced an early differentiation of A. thaliana seedlings suggesting an interference in the auxin action. Changes in the cellular ultrastructure may represent vacuolar and extracellular accumulation of TAA, to remove excess TAA in the cytosol and mitochondria. An inhibition of aconitase and the chelation of intracellular cations may have contributed to cytotoxicity of TAA at 1200 µM concentration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Iron deficiency in human diet is a serious problem leading, among others, to the development of iron-dependent anaemia, which affects 1.8 billion people worldwide. Biofortification of crop plants, including edible sprouts, is a promising strategy for combating dietary deficiencies. The aim of the present study is the evaluation of the effect of seeds imbibition in FeCl 2 solution with Fe at the concentrations of 100 and 500 mgL −1 on the seeds germination, growth of the seedlings, their antioxidant activity and the level of total phenolics and flavonoids. The results show that pre-treatment of seeds with Fe leads to increased accumulation of this metal in the germinated seedlings. In addition, it affects germs antioxidant activity and the level of flavonoids. On the other hand, seeds imbibition in FeCl 2 had no effect on the germination rate, growth of seedlings or total phenolic content (TPC). The results indicate that seeds imbibition in Fe solution is a promising strategy for obtaining Fe-enriched soybean sprouts.",

In this study, we performed a deep transcriptomic sequencing in Q. liaotungensis leaves, including de novo assembly and functional annotation for screening the candidate genes involved in drought avoidance. A total of 25,593 unigenes were obtained from Illumina sequencing platform. According to Gene Ontology annotation and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, we screened a series of candidate genes encoding SOD, POD, CAT, DREB, MYB, WRKY, bZIP, and NAC from the Q. liaotungensis leaf transcriptome, all of which are potentially involved in drought resistance. The results of this study expanded the genetic resources of Q. liaotungensis and provided a theoretical basis for further exploring the functional gene information of Q. liaotungensis .",

    "abstract": "The main objective of this study was to analyze the differences in profiles of RNase activities from triticale embryos (Triticosecale, cv. Ugo) between dormant and non-dormant caryopses and to determine the influence of exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) on the activities of these enzymes. The major RNase from the examined tissue was detected following SDS-PAGE, with substrate-based gel assay, described by Yen and Green (Plant Physiol 97:1487–1493, 1991). The activities of enzymes were characterized according to their pH optima, ion dependence, EDTA sensitivity and DNase activity. In embryos with arrested growth (in a natural way by dormancy or artificially by ABA treatment), the activity of two enzymes—24 and 27 kDa—belonging to class I RNases was completely inhibited, whereas that of two other RNases of this family—23 and 25 kDa—was detectable. However, the activity of the class I ribonucleases (enzymes responsible for cellular Pi release) was very low. Moreover, in contrast with non-dormant caryopses, imbibing embryos of dormant or ABA-treated seeds contained 13- and 14-kDa enzymes. These enzymes have not been classified so far, and their specific properties are different from the generally accepted properties of ribonucleolytic enzymes. In addition to the above results, the Pi content in the analyzed samples was determined by the Ames (Methods Enzymol 8:115–118, 1966) method. The results suggest a very low and constant level of inorganic phosphate in dormant samples as well as an evidently decreasing Pi content in embryos under the influence of ABA treatment. The inhibition of the class I RNases activity induced by abscisic acid implies that one of the roles of ABA in seed dormancy may consist in arresting the catabolic release of Pi, which results in retarding the embryo’s growth.",

    "abstract": "To study the behavior of newly synthesized RNA molecules during unperturbed mitosis and after induction of aneuploid nuclei, a novel method based on the incorporation of 5-ethynyl uridine was applied. This approach allows revealing transcription in cytological specimens by omitting immunocytochemical procedures. The obtained results indicate that RNAs synthesized in the preceding cell cycle behave similarly as nucleolar proteins and participate in post-mitotic nucleolar assembly not only during unperturbed nuclear divisions. Colocalization of nucleolar proteins and RNAs seems also to occur in aneuploid nuclei devoid of functional nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) or NOR per se. This paper also shows the presence of nucleoplasmic gene expression in aberrant aneuploid nuclei and micronuclei, despite occurrence of their genetic material disorganization. Moreover, experiments showing the effect of transcription and replication inhibition on the induction of aneuploid nuclei were also performed. Presented data shed new light on nucleologenesis and co-existence of nucleolar proteins with RNAs in prenucleolar bodies formed in aneuploid nuclei devoid of functional NORs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The goal of this study was to look into growth changes and a number of metabolic events in Fe 2+ treated Lupinus albus, Triticum aestivum , Vicia faba, and Zea mays plants and assess the role of biosorption of Fe 2+ by Rhodotorula mucilaginosa YMM19 to alleviate these changes. The effect of Fe 2+ concentrations (untreated and treated with biosorbent) on seed germination was studied. T. aestivum plumule was stimulated with a low dose of Fe 2+ . However, the application of Fe 2+ reduced the elongation of plumule, and radicle of all seeds during germination. High doses of Fe 2+ treated with biosorbent significantly increased seedling weights (fresh and dry) of all plants. Also, after 20 days, the height, and weight of seedlings of L. albus , T. aestivum , and Z. mays were increased with biosorbed Fe 2+ solution. In addition, biosorption of Fe 2+ enhanced total carbohydrate and protein accumulation in both T. aestivum and Z. mays radicles. Moreover, Fe 2+ caused slight suppression of α- and β-amylase in L. albus and Z. mays seeds after 2 days, but the opposite effect was observed in T. aestivum . Thus, the biosorption by R. mucilaginosa YMM19 is an efficient system for removing the negative effect of excess Fe 2+ from water.",
