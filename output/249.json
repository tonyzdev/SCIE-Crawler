    "abstract": "Optical trapping describes the interaction between light and matter to manipulate micro-objects through momentum transfer. In the case of 3D trapping with a single beam, this is termed optical tweezers. Optical tweezers are a powerful and noninvasive tool for manipulating small objects, and have become indispensable in many fields, including physics, biology, soft condensed matter, among others. In the early days, optical trapping was typically accomplished with a single Gaussian beam. In recent years, we have witnessed rapid progress in the use of structured light beams with customized phase, amplitude, and polarization in optical trapping. Unusual beam properties, such as phase singularities on-axis and propagation invariant nature, have opened up novel capabilities to the study of micromanipulation in liquid, air, and vacuum. We summarize the recent advances in the field of optical trapping using structured light beams.",

Inthis review we provide a comprehensive discussion of the recent progress achieved with photonic metamaterials whoseproperties stem from their modulation in time. We review the basic concepts underpinning temporal switching and itsrelation with spatial scattering, and deploy the resulting insight to review photonic time-crystals and their emergentresearch avenues such as topological and non-Hermitian physics. We then extend our discussion to account for spa-tiotemporal modulation and its applications to nonreciprocity, synthetic motion, giant anisotropy, amplification andother effects. Finally, we conclude with a review of the most attractive experimental avenues recently demonstrated,and provide a few perspectives on emerging trends for future implementations of time-modulation in photonics.",

Because of the unique optically-induced electric and magnetic Mie resonances, high-index nanoscale structures are expected to complement or even replace different plasmonic components in a range of potential applications. Here we study strong coupling between modes of a single subwavelength high-index dielectric resonator and analyse the mode transformation and Fano resonances when resonator's aspect ratio varies. We demonstrate that strong mode coupling results in resonances with high quality factors, which are related to the physics of bound states in the continuum when the radiative losses are almost suppressed due to the Friedrich-Wintgen scenario of destructive interference. We explain the physics of these states in terms of multipole decomposition and show that their appearance is accompanied by drastic change of the far-field radiation pattern. We reveal a fundamental link between the formation of the high-quality resonances and peculiarities of the Fano parameter in the scattering cross-section spectra. Our theoretical findings are confirmed by microwave experiments for the scattering of a high-index cylindrical resonators with a tunable aspect ratio. The proposed mechanism of the strong mode coupling in single subwavelength high-index resonators accompanied by resonances with high quality factor helps to extend substantially functionalities of all-dielectric nanophotonics that opens new horizons for active and passive nanoscale metadevices.",

    "abstract": "Optical links are moving to higher and higher transmission speeds while shrinking to shorter and shorter ranges where optical links are envisaged even at the chip scale. The scaling in data speed and span of the optical links demands modulators to be concurrently performant and cost-effective. Silicon photonics (SiPh), a photonic integrated circuit technology that leverages the fabrication sophistication of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology, is well-positioned to deliver the performance, price, and manufacturing volume for the high-speed modulators of future optical communication links. SiPh has relied on the plasma dispersion effect, either in injection, depletion, or accumulation mode, to demonstrate efficient high-speed modulators. The high-speed plasma dispersion silicon modulators have been commercially deployed and have demonstrated excellent performance. Recent years have seen a paradigm shift where the integration of various electro-refractive and electro-absorptive materials has opened up additional routes toward performant SiPh modulators. These modulators are in the early years of their development. They promise to extend the performance beyond the limits set by the physical properties of silicon. The focus of our study is to provide a comprehensive review of contemporary (i.e., plasma dispersion modulators) and new modulator implementations that involve the integration of novel materials with SiPh.",

    "abstract": "Dynamically controlling terahertz (THz) wavefronts in a designable fashion is highly desired in practice. However, available methods working at microwave frequencies do not work well in the THz regime due to lacking suitable tunable elements with submicrometer sizes. Here, instead of locally controlling individual meta-atoms in a THz metasurface, we show that rotating different layers (each exhibiting a particular phase profile) in a cascaded metadevice at different speeds can dynamically change the effective Jones-matrix property of the whole device, thus enabling extraordinary manipulations on the wavefront and polarization characteristics of a THz beam impinging on the device. After illustrating our strategy based on model calculations, we experimentally demonstrate two proof-of-concept metadevices, each consisting of two carefully designed all-silicon transmissive metasurfaces exhibiting different phase profiles. Rotating two metasurfaces inside the fabricated devices at different speeds, we experimentally demonstrate that the first metadevice can efficiently redirect a normally incident THz beam to scan over a wide solid-angle range, while the second one can dynamically manipulate both the wavefront and polarization of a THz beam. Our results pave the way to achieving dynamic control of THz beams, which is useful in many applications, such as THz radar, and bio- and chemical sensing and imaging.",

    "abstract": "Lithium niobate (LN) has experienced significant developments during past decades due to its versatile properties, especially its large electro-optic (EO) coefficient. For example, bulk LN-based modulators with high speeds and a superior linearity are widely used in typical fiber-optic communication systems. However, with ever-increasing demands for signal transmission capacity, the high power and large size of bulk LN-based devices pose great challenges, especially when one of its counterparts, integrated silicon photonics, has experienced dramatic developments in recent decades. Not long ago, high-quality thin-film LN on insulator (LNOI) became commercially available, which has paved the way for integrated LN photonics and opened a hot research area of LN photonics devices. LNOI allows a large refractive index contrast, thus light can be confined within a more compact structure. Together with other properties of LN, such as nonlinear/acousto-optic/pyroelectric effects, various kinds of high-performance integrated LN devices can be demonstrated. A comprehensive summary of advances in LN photonics is provided. As LN photonics has experienced several decades of development, our review includes some of the typical bulk LN devices as well as recently developed thin film LN devices. In this way, readers may be inspired by a complete picture of the evolution of this technology. We first introduce the basic material properties of LN and several key processing technologies for fabricating photonics devices. After that, various kinds of functional devices based on different effects are summarized. Finally, we give a short summary and perspective of LN photonics. We hope this review can give readers more insight into recent advances in LN photonics and contribute to the further development of LN related research.",

    "abstract": "The problem of imaging through thick scattering media is encountered in many disciplines of science, ranging from mesoscopic physics to astronomy. Photons become diffusive after propagating through a scattering medium with an optical thickness of over 10 times the scattering mean free path. As a result, no image but only noise-like patterns can be directly formed. We propose a hybrid neural network for computational imaging through such thick scattering media, demonstrating the reconstruction of image information from various targets hidden behind a white polystyrene slab of 3 mm in thickness or 13.4 times the scattering mean free path. We also demonstrate that the target image can be retrieved with acceptable quality from a very small fraction of its scattered pattern, suggesting that the speckle pattern produced in this way is highly redundant. This leads to a profound question of how the information of the target being encoded into the speckle is to be addressed in future studies.",

Terahertz surface plasmonic waves that propagate at metal–dielectric interfaces deliver a potentially effective way to realize integrated terahertz devices and systems. Previous concerns regarding terahertz surface plasmonic waves have been based on their highly delocalized feature. However, recent advances in plasmonics indicate that the confinement of terahertz surface plasmonic waves, as well as their propagating behaviors, can be engineered by designing the surface environments, shapes, structures, materials, etc., enabling a unique and fascinating regime of plasmonic waves. Together with the essential spectral property of terahertz radiation, as well as the increasingly developed materials, microfabrication, and time-domain spectroscopy technologies, devices and systems based on terahertz surface plasmonic waves may pave the way toward highly integrated platforms for multifunctional operation, implementation, and processing of terahertz waves in both fundamental science and practical applications. We present a review on terahertz surface plasmonic waves on various types of supports in a sequence of properties, excitation and detection, and applications. The current research trend and outlook of possible research directions for terahertz surface plasmonic waves are also outlined.",

    "abstract": "Digital holography records the entire wavefront of an object, including amplitude and phase. To reconstruct the object numerically, we can backpropagate the hologram with Fresnel–Kirchhoff integral-based algorithms such as the angular spectrum method and the convolution method. Although effective, these techniques require prior knowledge, such as the object distance, the incident angle between the two beams, and the source wavelength. Undesirable zero-order and twin images have to be removed by an additional filtering operation, which is usually manual and consumes more time in off-axis configuration. In addition, for phase imaging, the phase aberration has to be compensated, and subsequently an unwrapping step is needed to recover the true object thickness. The former either requires additional hardware or strong assumptions, whereas the phase unwrapping algorithms are often sensitive to noise and distortion. Furthermore, for a multisectional object, an all-in-focus image and depth map are desired for many applications, but current approaches tend to be computationally demanding. We propose an end-to-end deep learning framework, called a holographic reconstruction network, to tackle these holographic reconstruction problems. Through this data-driven approach, we show that it is possible to reconstruct a noise-free image that does not require any prior knowledge and can handle phase imaging as well as depth map generation.",

However, the self-starting process of mode-locked lasers is quite sensitive to environmental perturbation, which causes the transient behaviors of lasers to deviate from the true buildup process of solitons. We optimize the laser system to improve its stability, which suppresses the Q-switched lasing induced by environmental perturbation. We, therefore, demonstrate the first observation of the entire buildup process of solitons in a mode-locked laser, revealing two possible pathways to generate the temporal solitons. One pathway includes the dynamics of raised relaxation oscillation, quasimode-locking stage, spectral beating behavior, and finally the stable single-soliton mode-locking. The other pathway contains, however, an extra transient bound-state stage before the final single-pulse mode-locking operation. Moreover, we propose a theoretical model to predict the buildup time of solitons, which agrees well with the experimental results. Our findings can bring real-time insights into ultrafast fiber laser design and optimization, as well as promote the application of fiber laser.",

Here, we present a universal approach of finding out a series of high-Q resonant modes in a single nonspherical dielectric nanocavity by exploring quasi-bound state in the continuum. Unlike conventional method relying on heavy computation (ie, frequency scanning by FDTD), our approach is built upon leaky mode engineering, through which many high-Q modes can be easily achieved by constructing avoid-crossing (or crossing) of the eigenvalue for pair leaky modes. The Q-factor can be up to 2.3*10^4 for square subwavelength nanowire (NW) (n=4), which is 64 times larger than the highest Q-factor (Q=360) reported so far in single subwavelength nanodisk. Such high-Q modes can be attributed to suppressed radiation in the corresponding eigenchannels and simultaneously quenched electric(magnetic) at momentum space. As a proof of concept, we experimentally demonstrate the emergence of the high-Q resonant modes (Q=380) in the scattering spectrum of a single silicon subwavelength nanowire.",

We propose and experimentally demonstrate high-dimensional orbital angular momentum (OAM) multiplexing nonlinear holography to overcome this problem. By dividing the wavefront of the fundamental wave into different orthogonal OAM channels, multiple OAM and polarization-dependent holographic images in both the fundamental wave and second-harmonic wave have been reconstructed independently in the spatial frequency domain through a type-II second harmonic generation process. Moreover, this method can be easily extended to cascaded χ2 nonlinear optical processes for multiplexing in more wavelength channels, leading to potential applications in multicasting in optical communications, multiwavelength display, multidimensional optical storage, anticounterfeiting, and optical encryption.",

Photonic spin angular momentum (SAM) interactions with matter have long been studied, whereas the photonic OAM has only recently been discovered, receiving attention in the past three decades. Although controlling polarization (i.e., SAM) alone can provide useful information about the media with which the light interacts, light fields carrying both OAM and SAM may provide additional information, permitting new sensing mechanisms and light–matter interactions. We summarize recent developments in controlling photonic angular momentum (AM) using complex structured optical fields. Arbitrarily oriented photonic SAM and OAM states may be generated through careful engineering of the spatial and temporal structures of optical fields. Moreover, we discuss potential applications of specifically engineered photonic AM states in optical tweezers, directional coupling, and optical information transmission and processing.",

    "abstract": "Augmented reality (AR) display, which superimposes virtual images on ambient scene, can visually blend the physical world and the digital world and thus opens a new vista for human–machine interaction. AR display is considered as one of the next-generation display technologies and has been drawing huge attention from both academia and industry. Current AR display systems operate based on a combination of various refractive, reflective, and diffractive optical elements, such as lenses, prisms, mirrors, and gratings. Constrained by the underlying physical mechanisms, these conventional elements only provide limited light-field modulation capability and suffer from issues such as bulky volume and considerable dispersion, resulting in large size, severe chromatic aberration, and narrow field of view of the composed AR display system. Recent years have witnessed the emerging of a new type of optical elements—metasurfaces, which are planar arrays of subwavelength electromagnetic structures that feature an ultracompact footprint and flexible light-field modulation capability, and are widely believed to be an enabling tool for overcoming the limitations faced by current AR displays. Here, we aim to provide a comprehensive review on the recent development of metasurface-enabled AR display technology. We first familiarize readers with the fundamentals of AR display, covering its basic working principle, existing conventional-optics-based solutions, as well as the associated pros and cons. We then introduce the concept of optical metasurfaces, emphasizing typical operating mechanisms, and representative phase modulation methods. We elaborate on three kinds of metasurface devices, namely, metalenses, metacouplers, and metaholograms, which have empowered different forms of AR displays. Their physical principles, device designs, and the performance improvement of the associated AR displays are explained in details. In the end, we discuss the existing challenges of metasurface optics for AR display applications and provide our perspective on future research endeavors.",

    "abstract": "Femtosecond laser inscription or writing has been recognized as a powerful technique to engineer various materials toward a number of applications. By efficient modification of refractive indices of dielectric crystals, optical waveguides with diverse configurations have been produced by femtosecond laser writing. The waveguiding properties depend not only on the parameters of the laser writing but also on the nature of the crystals. The mode profile tailoring and polarization engineering are realizable by selecting appropriate fabrication conditions. In addition, regardless of the complexity of crystal refractive index changes induced by ultrafast pulses, several three-dimensional geometries have been designed and implemented that are useful for the fabrication of laser-written photonic chips. Some intriguing devices, e.g., waveguide lasers, wavelength converters, and quantum memories, have been made, exhibiting potential for applications in various areas. Our work gives a concise review of the femtosecond laser-inscribed waveguides in dielectric crystals and focuses on the recent advances of this research area, including the fundamentals, fabrication, and selected photonic applications.",

Both real-world and experimentally simulated turbulence conditions have revealed that free-space structured light modes are perturbed in some manner by turbulence, resulting in both amplitude and phase distortions, and consequently, much attention has focused on whether one mode type is more robust than another, but with seemingly inconclusive and contradictory results. We present complex forms of structured light that are invariant under propagation through the atmosphere: the true eigenmodes of atmospheric turbulence. We provide a theoretical procedure for obtaining these eigenmodes and confirm their invariance both numerically and experimentally.

Design and fabrication of such light sources remain a challenge due to the difficulties in making a laser cavity that has an ultrahigh optical quality (Q) factor and supports only a single lasing frequency simultaneously. Here, we demonstrate a unique single-frequency ultranarrow linewidth lasing mechanism on an erbium ion-doped lithium niobate (LN) microdisk through simultaneous excitation of high-Q polygon modes at both pump and laser wavelengths. As the polygon modes are sparse within the optical gain bandwidth compared with the whispering gallery mode counterpart, while their Q factors (above 10 million) are even higher due to the significantly reduced scattering on their propagation paths, single-frequency lasing with a linewidth as narrow as 322 Hz is observed. The measured linewidth is three orders of magnitude narrower than the previous record in on-chip LN microlasers. Finally, enabled by the strong linear electro-optic effect of LN, real-time electro-optical tuning of the microlaser with a high tuning efficiency of ∼50 pm / 100 V is demonstrated.",

This broadband diffractive processor is composed of N_w wavelength channels, each of which is uniquely assigned to a distinct target transformation. A large set of arbitrarily-selected linear transformations can be individually performed through the same diffractive network at different illumination wavelengths, either simultaneously or sequentially (wavelength scanning). We demonstrate that such a broadband diffractive network, regardless of its material dispersion, can successfully approximate N_w unique complex-valued linear transforms with a negligible error when the number of diffractive neurons (N) in its design matches or exceeds 2 x N_w x N_i x N_o. We further report that the spectral multiplexing capability (N_w) can be increased by increasing N; our numerical analyses confirm these conclusions for N_w > 180, which can be further increased to e.g., ~2000 depending on the upper bound of the approximation error. Massively parallel, wavelength-multiplexed diffractive networks will be useful for designing high-throughput intelligent machine vision systems and hyperspectral processors that can perform statistical inference and analyze objects/scenes with unique spectral properties.",

Photonic memories employing nonvolatile phase-change materials could achieve zero static power consumption, low thermal cross talk, large-scale, and high-energy-efficient photonic neural networks. Nevertheless, the switching speed and dynamic energy consumption of phase-change material-based photonic memories make them inapplicable for in situ training. Here, by integrating a patch of phase change thin film with a PIN-diode-embedded microring resonator, a bifunctional photonic memory enabling both 5-bit storage and nanoseconds volatile modulation was demonstrated. For the first time, a concept is presented for electrically programmable phase-change material-driven photonic memory integrated with nanosecond modulation to allow fast in situ training and zero static power consumption data processing in ONNs. ONNs with an optical convolution kernel constructed by our photonic memory theoretically achieved an accuracy of predictions higher than 95% when tested by the MNIST handwritten digit database.

    "abstract": "Being invisible ad libitum has long captivated the popular imagination, particularly in terms of safeguarding modern high-end instruments from potential threats. Decades ago, the advent of metamaterials and transformation optics sparked considerable interest in invisibility cloaks, which have been mainly demonstrated in ground and waveguide modalities. However, an omnidirectional flying cloak has not been achieved, primarily due to the challenges associated with dynamic synthesis of metasurface dispersion. We demonstrate an autonomous aeroamphibious invisibility cloak that incorporates a suite of perception, decision, and execution modules, capable of maintaining invisibility amidst kaleidoscopic backgrounds and neutralizing external stimuli. The physical breakthrough lies in the spatiotemporal modulation imparted on tunable metasurfaces to sculpt the scattering field in both space and frequency domains. To intelligently control the spatiotemporal metasurfaces, we introduce a stochastic-evolution learning that automatically aligns with the optimal solution through maximum probabilistic inference. In a fully self-driving experiment, we implement this concept on an unmanned drone and showcase adaptive invisibility in three canonical landscapes—sea, land, and air—with a similarity rate of up to 95%. Our work extends the family of invisibility cloaks to flying modality and inspires other research on material discoveries and homeostatic meta-devices.",

In this work, we introduce an asynchronous structured light imaging approach based on generative deep neural networks to relax the synchronization constraint, accomplishing the challenges of fringe pattern aliasing, without relying on any a priori constraint of the projection system. To overcome this need, we propose a generative deep neural network with U-Net-like encoder–decoder architecture to learn the underlying fringe features directly by exploring the intrinsic prior principles in the fringe pattern aliasing. We train within an adversarial learning framework and supervise the network training via a statistics-informed loss function. We demonstrate that by evaluating the performance on fields of intensity, phase, and 3D reconstruction. It is shown that the trained network can separate aliased fringe patterns for producing comparable results with the synchronous one: the absolute error is no greater than 8 μm, and the standard deviation does not exceed 3 μm. Evaluation results on multiple objects and pattern types show it could be generalized for any asynchronous structured light scene.",

Herein, we report a high-performance pure-blue PeLED based on mixed-halide quasi-2D perovskites incorporated with a zwitterionic molecule of 3-(benzyldimethylammonio) propanesulfonate (3-BAS). Experimental and density functional theory analysis reveals that 3-BAS can simultaneously eliminate non-radiative recombination loss, suppress halide migration, and regulate phase distribution for smoothing energy transfer in the mixed-halide quasi-2D perovskites, leading to the final perovskites with high photoluminescence quantum yield and robust spectrum stability. Thus, the high-performance pure-blue PeLED with a recorded brightness with 1806 cd m−2 and a relative higher EQE of 9.25% is achieved, which is successfully demonstrated in a visible light communication system for voice signal transmission. We pave the way for achieving highly efficient pure-blue PeLEDs with great application potential in future optical communication networks.",

Optical frequency combs pushed measurement limits with ultrahigh-frequency accuracy and fast-measurement speed, while tunable-diode-laser spectroscopy is used in scenarios that require high power and continuous spectral coverage. Despite these advantages of tunable-diode-laser spectroscopy, it is challenging to precisely determine the instantaneous laser frequency because of fluctuations in the scan speed. Here, we demonstrate a simple spectroscopy scheme with a frequency-modulated diode laser that references the laser on-the-fly to a fiber cavity. The fiber cavity's free spectral range is on-the-fly calibrated with sub-10-Hz frequency precision. We achieve a relative precision of the laser frequency of 2×10−8 for an 11-THz frequency range at a measurement speed of 1 THz/s. This is an improvement of more than 2 orders of magnitude compared to existing diode-laser-spectroscopy methods. Our scheme provides precise frequency calibration markers, while simultaneously tracking the instantaneous scan speed of the laser. We demonstrate the versatility of our method through various applications, including dispersion measurement of a fiber, ultrahigh-Q microresonators, and spectroscopy of a hydrogen fluoride gas cell. The simplicity, robustness, and low cost of this spectroscopy scheme are valuable for out-of-the-lab applications like lidar and environmental monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Optical computing provides unique opportunities in terms of parallelization, scalability, power efficiency, and computational speed and has attracted major interest for machine learning. Diffractive deep neural networks have been introduced earlier as an optical machine learning framework that uses task-specific diffractive surfaces designed by deep learning to all-optically perform inference, achieving promising performance for object classification and imaging. We demonstrate systematic improvements in diffractive optical neural networks, based on a differential measurement technique that mitigates the strict nonnegativity constraint of light intensity. In this differential detection scheme, each class is assigned to a separate pair of detectors, behind a diffractive optical network, and the class inference is made by maximizing the normalized signal difference between the photodetector pairs. Using this differential detection scheme, involving 10 photodetector pairs behind 5 diffractive layers with a total of 0.2 million neurons, we numerically achieved blind testing accuracies of 98.54%, 90.54%, and 48.51% for MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and grayscale CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively. Moreover, by utilizing the inherent parallelization capability of optical systems, we reduced the cross-talk and optical signal coupling between the positive and negative detectors of each class by dividing the optical path into two jointly trained diffractive neural networks that work in parallel. We further made use of this parallelization approach and divided individual classes in a target dataset among multiple jointly trained diffractive neural networks. Using this class-specific differential detection in jointly optimized diffractive neural networks that operate in parallel, our simulations achieved blind testing accuracies of 98.52%, 91.48%, and 50.82% for MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and grayscale CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively, coming close to the performance of some of the earlier generations of all-electronic deep neural networks, e.g., LeNet, which achieves classification accuracies of 98.77%, 90.27%, and 55.21% corresponding to the same datasets, respectively. In addition to these jointly optimized diffractive neural networks, we also independently optimized multiple diffractive networks and utilized them in a way that is similar to ensemble methods practiced in machine learning; using 3 independently optimized differential diffractive neural networks that optically project their light onto a common output/detector plane, we numerically achieved blind testing accuracies of 98.59%, 91.06%, and 51.44% for MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and grayscale CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively. Through these systematic advances in designing diffractive neural networks, the reported classification accuracies set the state of the art for all-optical neural network design. The presented framework might be useful to bring optical neural network-based low power solutions for various machine learning applications and help us design new computational cameras that are task-specific.",

Due to the rapid development of micro/nanofabrication technology, breakthroughs in the quality factor of microresonators enable ultrahigh energy buildup inside cavities, which gives birth to microcavity-based frequency combs. In particular, the full coherent spectrum of the soliton microcomb (SMC) provides a route to low-noise ultrashort pulses with a repetition rate over two orders of magnitude higher than that of traditional mode-locking approaches. This enables lower power consumption and cost for a wide range of applications. This review summarizes recent achievements in SMCs, including the basic theory and physical model, as well as experimental techniques for single-soliton generation and various extraordinary soliton states (soliton crystals, Stokes solitons, breathers, molecules, cavity solitons, and dark solitons), with a perspective on their potential applications and remaining challenges.",

This type of oscillator is desired in various practical applications, such as communication links, signal processing, radar, metrology, radio astronomy, and reference clock distribution. Recently, new mode control and selection methods based on Fourier domain mode-locking and parity-time symmetry have been proposed and experimentally demonstrated in OEOs, which overcomes the long-existing mode building time and mode selection problems in a traditional OEO. Due to these mode control and selection methods, continuously chirped microwave waveforms can be generated directly from the OEO cavity and single-mode operation can be achieved without the need of ultranarrowband filters, which are not possible in a traditional OEO. Integrated OEOs with a compact size and low power consumption have also been demonstrated, which are key steps toward a new generation of compact and versatile OEOs for demanding applications. We review recent progress in the field of OEOs, with particular attention to new mode control and selection methods, as well as chip-scale integration of OEOs.",

Inspired by recent successes of deep learning techniques for computer vision and other applications, here, we demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that the deep neural networks can be trained to perform fringe analysis, which substantially enhances the accuracy of phase demodulation from a single fringe pattern. The effectiveness of the proposed method is experimentally verified using carrier fringe patterns under the scenario of fringe projection profilometry. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance in terms of high accuracy and edge-preserving over two representative single-frame techniques: Fourier transform profilometry and Windowed Fourier profilometry.",

    "abstract": "Overcoming chromatic aberrations is a vital concern in imaging systems in order to facilitate full-color and hyperspectral imaging. By contrast, large dispersion holds opportunities for spectroscopy and tomography. Combining both functions into a single component will significantly enhance its versatility. A strategy is proposed to delicately integrate two lenses with a static resonant phase and a switchable geometric phase separately. The former is a metasurface lens with a linear phase dispersion. The latter is composed of liquid crystals (LCs) with space-variant orientations with a phase profile that is frequency independent. By this means, a broadband achromatic focusing from 0.9 to 1.4 THz is revealed. When a saturated bias is applied on LCs, the geometric phase modulation vanishes, leaving only the resonant phase of the metalens. Correspondingly, the device changes from achromatic to dispersive. Furthermore, a metadeflector with tunable dispersion is demonstrated to verify the universality of the proposed method. Our work may pave a way toward active metaoptics, promoting various imaging applications.",

However, to adequately characterize a complex biosystem, an imaging system with a number of resolvable points, referred to as a space-bandwidth product (SBP), in excess of one billion is typically needed. Since a gigapixel-scale far exceeds the capacity of current optical imagers, compromises must be made to obtain either a low spatial resolution or a narrow field-of-view (FOV). The problem originates from constituent refractive optics-the larger the aperture, the more challenging the correction of lens aberrations. Therefore, it is impractical for a conventional optical imaging system to achieve an SBP over hundreds of millions. To address this unmet need, a variety of high-SBP imagers have emerged over the past decade, enabling an unprecedented resolution and FOV beyond the limit of conventional optics. We provide a comprehensive survey of high-SBP imaging techniques, exploring their underlying principles and applications in bioimaging.",

All-dielectric metasurfaces, supporting both electric and magnetic Mie-type resonances in their nanostructures, have appeared as a promising alternative to nonlinear plasmonics. High-index dielectric nanostructures, allowing additional magnetic resonances, can induce magnetic nonlinear effects, which along with electric nonlinearities increase the nonlinear conversion efficiency.

The phase dispersion is tuned successfully based on a multiresonant Lorentz model, and high reflection is guaranteed by the presence of the metallic ground.

An achromatic meta-mirror is proposed within 8 to 12 GHz, and another abnormal chromatic meta-mirror can tune the reflection angle as a linear function. Both meta-mirrors exhibit very high efficiencies (85% to 94% in the frequency band).

Recently, however, it was found that an unfocused light beam can also exert an optical pulling force (OPF) on an object toward the source direction; the beam is accordingly named an optical tractor beam. In recent years, this intriguing force has attracted much attention and a huge amount of progress has been made both in theory and experiment. We briefly review recent progress achieved on this topic. We classify the mechanisms to achieve an OPF into four different kinds according to the dominant factors. The first one is tailoring the incident beam. The second one is engineering the object's optical parameters. The third one is designing the structured material background, in which the light–matter interaction occurs, and the fourth one is utilizing the indirect photophoretic force, which is related to the thermal effect of light absorption. For all the methods, we analyze the basic principles and review the recent achievements. Finally, we also give a brief conclusion and an outlook on the future development of this field.",

Conventional infrared imaging technologies, however, require the use of materials like narrow-band gap semiconductors which are sensitive to thermal noise and often require cryogenic cooling. Here, we demonstrate a compact all-optical alternative to perform infrared imaging in a metasurface composed of GaAs semiconductor nanoantennas, using a nonlinear wave-mixing process. We experimentally show the up-conversion of short-wave infrared wavelengths via the coherent parametric process of sum-frequency generation. In this process, an infrared image of a target is mixed inside the metasurface with a strong pump beam, translating the image from infrared to the visible in a nanoscale ultra-thin imaging device. Our results open up new opportunities for the development of compact infrared imaging devices with applications in infrared vision and life sciences.",

First, the design strategies and photoswitching mechanisms for various kinds of organic photoresponsive materials, including small organic molecules, metal complexes, polymers, supramolecules, and cholesteric liquid crystals, are systematically summarized. These materials exhibit reversible changes of absorption and/or emission properties in response to different wavelengths of light.

Finding appropriate strategies to increase the robustness to scattering is the common requirement in developing both communication protocols and imaging systems. Recently, structured light has attracted attention due to its seeming scattering resistance in terms of transmissivity and spatial behavior. Moreover, correlation between optical polarization and orbital angular momentum (OAM), which characterizes the so-called vector vortex beam (VVB) states, seems to allow for the preservation of the polarization pattern. We extend the analysis by investigating both the spatial features and the polarization structure of vectorial optical vortexes propagating in scattering media with different concentrations. Among the observed features, we find a sudden swift decrease in contrast ratio for Gaussian, OAM, and VVB modes for concentrations of the adopted scattering media exceeding 0.09%. Our analysis provides a more general and complete study on the propagation of structured light in dispersive and scattering media.",

However, real-time observation is still out of reach for most SIM setups as conventional algorithms for image reconstruction involve a heavy computing burden. To address this limitation, an accelerated reconstruction algorithm was developed by implementing a simplified workflow for SR-SIM, termed joint space and frequency reconstruction. This algorithm results in an 80-fold improvement in reconstruction speed relative to the widely used Wiener-SIM. Critically, the increased processing speed does not come at the expense of spatial resolution or sectioning capability, as demonstrated by live imaging of microtubule dynamics and mitochondrial tubulation.",

We experimentally construct all-electric Huygens and spin metasources and demonstrate anomalous unidirectional excitation of high-k hyperbolic modes in two types of hyperbolic metasurfaces. We use a Huygens metasource to study the unidirectional excitation of hyperbolic bulk modes in a planar hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM). Specifically, unidirectional excitation is the same as that in free space in the vertical direction, but opposite to that in free space in the horizontal direction. This anomalous unidirectional excitation is determined by the anisotropic HMM dispersion. In addition, we use a spin metasource to observe the anomalous photonic spin Hall effect in a planar hyperbolic waveguide. For a near-field source with a specific spin, the guide mode with a fixed directional wave vector is excited due to spin-momentum locking. Because the directions of momentum and energy flows in the HMM waveguide are opposite, the unidirectional excitation of hyperbolic guided modes is reversed. Our results not only uncover the sophisticated electromagnetic functionalities of metasources in the near-field but may also provide novel opportunities for the development of integrated optical devices.",

    "abstract": "Fano resonances are conventionally understood as sharp spectral features with selectivity in the momentum-frequency domain, implying that they can be excited only by plane waves with specific frequencies and incident angles. We demonstrate that Fano resonances can be made generally selective in the space-frequency domain. They can be tailored to resonate only when excited by a frequency, polarization, and wavefront of choice. This generalization reveals that Fano systems are characterized by eigenwaves that scatter to their time-reversed image upon reflection. Although in conventional Fano systems this trivially occurs for normally incident plane waves, we show that, in general, the selected wavefront is locally retroreflected everywhere across the device. These results show that conventional Fano resonances are a subset of a broader dichroic phenomenon with spin, spatial, and spectral selectivity. We demonstrate these concepts with nonlocal metasurfaces whose governing principles are deeply rooted in the symmetry features of quasi-bound states in the continuum. Enhanced light–matter interactions and symmetry-protection make these phenomena uniquely suited for enriching applications in quantum optics, non-linear optics, augmented reality, and secure optical communications, laying the groundwork for a range of novel compact optical sources and devices.",

The compact all-fiber laser consists of a double-clad Pr3 + -doped fluoride fiber, two homemade fiber dichroic mirrors at visible wavelengths, and a 443-nm fiber-pigtailed pump source.

Moreover, these green all-fiber laser designs are optimized by using experiments and numerical simulations. Numerical results are in excellent agreement with our experimental results and show that the optimal gain fiber length, output mirror reflectivity, and doping level should be considered to obtain higher power and efficiency.

However, most optical-chaos-based random bit generators perform their quantization process in the electrical domain using electrical analog-to-digital converters, so their real-time rates in a single channel are severely limited at the level of Gb/s due to the electronic bottleneck. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an all-optical method for RBG where chaotic pulses are quantized into a physical random bit stream in the all-optical domain by means of a length of highly nonlinear fiber. In our proof-of-concept experiment, a 10-Gb/s random bit stream is successfully generated on-line using our method. Note that the single-channel real-time rate is limited only by the chaos bandwidth. Considering that the Kerr nonlinearity of silica fiber with an ultrafast response of few femtoseconds is exploited for composing the key part of quantizing laser chaos, this scheme thus may operate potentially at much higher real-time rates than 100 Gb/s provided that a chaotic entropy source of sufficient bandwidth is available.",

This provides a simple and universal way to effortlessly determine the properties of a metasurface scattering response, such as chirality or asymmetric transmission, and which of its effective material parameters should be taken into account in the prospect of a homogenization procedure. In contrast to existing techniques, this approach does not require any a priori knowledge of group theory or complicated numerical simulation schemes, hence making it fast, easy to use and accessible. Its working principle consists in recursively solving symmetry-invariance conditions that apply to dipolar and quadrupolar material parameters, which include nonlocal interactions, as well as the metasurface scattering matrix. The overall process thus only requires listing the spatial symmetries of the metasurface. Using the proposed framework, we demonstrate the existence of multipolar extrinsic chirality, which is a form of chiral response that is achieved in geometrically achiral structures sensitive to field gradients, even at normal incidence.",

    "abstract": "Estimation of physical quantities is at the core of most scientific research, and the use of quantum devices promises to enhance its performances. In real scenarios, it is fundamental to consider that resources are limited, and Bayesian adaptive estimation represents a powerful approach to efficiently allocate, during the estimation process, all the available resources. However, this framework relies on the precise knowledge of the system model, retrieved with a fine calibration, with results that are often computationally and experimentally demanding. We introduce a model-free and deep-learning-based approach to efficiently implement realistic Bayesian quantum metrology tasks accomplishing all the relevant challenges, without relying on any a priori knowledge of the system. To overcome this need, a neural network is trained directly on experimental data to learn the multiparameter Bayesian update. Then the system is set at its optimal working point through feedback provided by a reinforcement learning algorithm trained to reconstruct and enhance experiment heuristics of the investigated quantum sensor. Notably, we prove experimentally the achievement of higher estimation performances than standard methods, demonstrating the strength of the combination of these two black-box algorithms on an integrated photonic circuit. Our work represents an important step toward fully artificial intelligence-based quantum metrology.",

Probing TAM and tailoring beam's TAM spectrum on demand are of great significance for TAM-based scenarios. We propose both theoretically and experimentally a TAM processor enabling tunable TAM manipulation. Such a processor consists of a set of quasi-symmetric units, and each unit is composed of a couple of diffraction optical elements fabricated through polymerized liquid crystals. Forty-two single TAM states are experimentally employed to prove the concept. The favorable results illustrate good TAM state selection performance, which makes it particularly attractive for high-speed large-capacity data transmission, optical computing, and high-security photon encryption systems.",

    "abstract": "Improving the spatial resolution of a fluorescence microscope has been an ongoing challenge in the imaging community. To address this challenge, a variety of approaches have been taken, ranging from instrumentation development to image postprocessing. An example of the latter is deconvolution, where images are numerically deblurred based on a knowledge of the microscope point spread function. However, deconvolution can easily lead to noise-amplification artifacts. Deblurring by postprocessing can also lead to negativities or fail to conserve local linearity between sample and image. We describe here a simple image deblurring algorithm based on pixel reassignment that inherently avoids such artifacts and can be applied to general microscope modalities and fluorophore types. Our algorithm helps distinguish nearby fluorophores, even when these are separated by distances smaller than the conventional resolution limit, helping facilitate, for example, the application of single-molecule localization microscopy in dense samples. We demonstrate the versatility and performance of our algorithm under a variety of imaging conditions.",

Quasi-normal-mode theory reveals that the physics is governed by the spatial overlap between wave functions of resonant modes and regions inside resonators perturbed by pump laser excitation at different wavelengths. We further design/fabricate a dielectric metasurface and experimentally demonstrate that it can dynamically control the polarization state of incident THz waves, dictated by the strength and wavelength of the pumping light. We finally numerically demonstrate pump wavelength-controlled optical information encryption based on a carefully designed dielectric metasurface. Our studies reveal that pump light wavelength can be a new external knob to dynamically control THz waves, which may inspire many tunable metadevices with diversified functionalities.",

    "abstract": "Explosive growth in demand for data traffic has prompted exploration of the spatial dimension of light waves, which provides a degree of freedom to expand data transmission capacity. Various techniques based on bulky optical devices have been proposed to tailor light waves in the spatial dimension. However, their inherent large size, extra loss, and precise alignment requirements make these techniques relatively difficult to implement in a compact and flexible way. In contrast, three-dimensional (3D) photonic chips with compact size and low loss provide a promising miniaturized candidate for tailoring light in the spatial dimension. Significantly, they are attractive for chip-assisted short-distance spatial mode optical interconnects that are challenging to bulky optics. Here, we propose and fabricate femtosecond laser-inscribed 3D photonic chips to tailor orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes in the spatial dimension. Various functions on the platform of 3D photonic chips are experimentally demonstrated, including the generation, (de)multiplexing, and exchange of OAM modes. Moreover, chip-chip and chip–fiber–chip short-distance optical interconnects using OAM modes are demonstrated in the experiment with favorable performance. This work paves the way to flexibly tailor light waves on 3D photonic chips and offers a compact solution for versatile optical interconnects and other emerging applications with spatial modes.",

For a STOV pulse, its spatiotemporal profile can be significantly distorted due to unbalanced dispersive and diffractive phases. This may limit its use in many research applications, where a long interaction length and a tight confinement of the pulse are needed. The first demonstration of STOV pulse propagation through a few-mode optical fiber is presented. Both numerical and experimental analysis on the propagation of STOV pulse through a commercially available SMF-28 standard telecommunication fiber is performed. The spatiotemporal phase feature of the pulse can be well kept after the pulse propagates a few-meter length through the fiber even with bending. Further propagation of the pulse will result in a breakup of its spatiotemporal spiral phase structure due to an excessive amount of modal group delay dispersion. The stable and robust transmission of transverse photonic OAM through optical fiber may open new opportunities for transverse photonic OAM studies in telecommunications, OAM lasers, and nonlinear fiber-optical research.",

    "abstract": "The ever-increasing demand for training and inferring with larger machine-learning models requires more efficient hardware solutions due to limitations such as power dissipation and scalability. Optics is a promising contender for providing lower power computation, since light propagation through a nonabsorbing medium is a lossless operation. However, to carry out useful and efficient computations with light, generating and controlling nonlinearity optically is a necessity that is still elusive. Multimode fibers (MMFs) have been shown that they can provide nonlinear effects with microwatts of average power while maintaining parallelism and low loss. We propose an optical neural network architecture that performs nonlinear optical computation by controlling the propagation of ultrashort pulses in MMF by wavefront shaping. With a surrogate model, optimal sets of parameters are found to program this optical computer for different tasks with minimal utilization of an electronic computer. We show a remarkable decrease of 97% in the number of model parameters, which leads to an overall 99% digital operation reduction compared to an equivalently performing digital neural network. We further demonstrate that a fully optical implementation can also be performed with competitive accuracies.",

However, it is challenging to realize sub-femtometer resolution spectroscopy over broad bandwidth. Broadband and high-resolution spectroscopy with calibrated optical frequency is demonstrated by bridging the fields of speckle pattern and electro-optic frequency comb. A wavemeter based on a whispering-gallery-mode barcode is proposed to link the frequencies of a probe continuous-wave laser and an ultrastable laser. The ultrafine electro-optic comb lines are generated from the probe laser to record spectrum of sample with sub-femtometer resolution. Measurement bandwidth is a thousandfold broader than comb bandwidth, by sequentially tuning the probe laser while its wavelength is determined. This approach fully exploits the advantages of two fields to realize 0.8-fm resolution with a fiber laser and 80-nm bandwidth with an external cavity diode laser. The spectroscopic measurements of an ultrahigh Q-factor cavity and gas molecular absorption are experimentally demonstrated.

Utilizing multiple spatially engineered diffractive layers trained through deep learning, this diffractive processor can transform the phase distributions of multiple two-dimensional objects at various axial positions into intensity patterns, each encoded at a unique wavelength channel. These wavelength-multiplexed patterns are projected onto a single field of view at the output plane of the diffractive processor, enabling the capture of quantitative phase distributions of input objects located at different axial planes using an intensity-only image sensor. Based on numerical simulations, we show that our diffractive processor could simultaneously achieve all-optical QPI across several distinct axial planes at the input by scanning the illumination wavelength. A proof-of-concept experiment with a 3D-fabricated diffractive processor further validates our approach, showcasing successful imaging of two distinct phase objects at different axial positions by scanning the illumination wavelength in the terahertz spectrum.

Furthermore, we use the module to introduce a robust multispecies approach encoding the fluorophore excitation spectra in the time domain.

However, inherent diffraction in free space results in the inevitable expansion of beam size and divergence contingent upon the OAM, limiting vortex beams' applicability in areas such as spatial mode multiplexing communication, fiber-optic data transmission, and particle manipulation. These domains necessitate vortex beams with OAM-independent propagation characteristics. We introduce iso-propagation vortices (IPVs), vortex beams characterized by OAM-independent propagation behavior, achieved through precise radial index configuration of Laguerre–Gaussian beams. IPVs display notable transmission dynamics, including a reduced quality factor, resilience post-damage, and decreased and uniform modal scattering under atmospheric turbulence. Their distinctive attributes render IPVs valuable for potential applications in imaging, microscopy, optical communication, metrology, quantum information processing, and light–matter interactions. Notably, within optical communication, the case study suggests that the IPV basis, due to its OAM-independent propagation behavior, provides access to a more extensive spectrum of data channels compared with conventional spatial multiplexing techniques, consequently augmenting information capacity.",

Both photoactive material engineering and nanophotonic filtering schemes have been explored to realize wavelength-selective photodetection, while most devices have a responsive bandwidth larger than 2% of the operating wavelength, limiting sensing performance. Near-infrared photodetection with a bandwidth of less than 0.2% of the operating wavelength was demonstrated experimentally in Au/Si Schottky nanojunctions. A minimum linewidth of photoelectric response down to 2.6 nm was obtained at a wavelength of 1550 nm by carefully tailing the absorptive and radiative loss in the nanostructures. Multiple functions were achieved on chip with the corrugated Au film, including narrowband resonance, light harvesting for sensing and photodetection, and electrodes for hot electron emission. Benefiting from such a unity integration with in situ photoelectric conversion of the optical sensing signal and the ultranarrowband resonance, self-contained on-chip biosensing via simple intensity interrogation was demonstrated with a limit of detection down to 0.0047% in concentration for glucose solution and 150 ng/mL for rabbit IgG.

Herein, we successfully realize the orthogonal modal decomposition of partially coherent beams and introduce the application of coherence entropy as a global coherence characteristic of such randomly fluctuated light fields. It is demonstrated that coherence entropy remains consistent during propagation in a unitary system by unraveling complex channels. As representative examples, we study the robustness of coherence entropy for partially coherent beams as they propagate through deformed optical systems and turbulent media. Coherence entropy is anticipated to serve as a key metric for evaluating the propagation of partially coherent beams in complex channels.

Topological insulators featuring unique spin-momentum–locked surface state have already exhibited very promising prospects in terahertz emission, detection, and modulation, which may lay a foundation for future on-chip topological insulator-based terahertz systems. However, polarization-shaped terahertz emitters based on topological insulators with an arbitrarily manipulated temporal evolution of the amplitude and the electric-field vector direction have not yet been explored. We systematically investigated the terahertz radiation from topological insulator Bi2Te3 nanofilms driven by femtosecond laser pulses and successfully realized the generation of efficient chiral terahertz waves with controllable chirality, ellipticity, and principal axis. The convenient engineering of the chiral terahertz waves was interpreted by a photogalvanic effect (PGE)-induced photocurrent, while the linearly polarized terahertz waves originated from linear PGE-induced shift currents. Our work not only provides further understanding of femtosecond coherent control of ultrafast spin currents but also describes an effective way to generate spin-polarized terahertz waves at the source.",

Such endeavors, however, have focused mainly on linear topological states in real or synthetic Dirac/Weyl materials. Here, we demonstrate nonlinear valley Hall edge states (VHESs) in laser-writing anisotropic photonic lattices hosting type-II Dirac points. These self-trapped VHESs, manifested as topological gap quasi-solitons, are fundamentally distinct from their linear counterparts in type-I lattices and from all previously found topological solitons.

Compared with traditional incandescent bulbs and inorganic diodes, pure organic materials are superior in terms of better compatibility, flexibility, structural diversity, and environmental friendliness. In the past few years, polychromic emission has been obtained based on organic aggregates, which provides a platform to achieve white-light emission. Several white-light emitters are sporadically reported, but the underlying mechanistic picture is still not fully established. Based on these considerations, we will focus on the single-component and multicomponent strategies to achieve efficient white-light emission from pure organic aggregates. Thereinto, single-component strategy is introduced from four parts: dual fluorescence, fluorescence and phosphorescence, dual phosphorescence with anti-Kasha's behavior, and clusteroluminescence. Meanwhile, doping, supramolecular assembly, and cocrystallization are summarized as strategies for multicomponent systems. Beyond the construction strategies of white-light emitters, their advanced representative applications, such as organic light-emitting diodes, white luminescent dyes, circularly polarized luminescence, and encryption, are also prospected. It is expected that this review will draw a comprehensive picture of white-light emission from organic aggregates as well as their emerging applications.",

Under plane wave illumination, the resolution is increased by twofold to around 260 nm, while achieving millisecond-level temporal resolution. In HISTR-SAPM, digital micromirror devices are used to actively change the sample illumination beam angle at high speed with high stability. An off-axis interferometer is used to measure the sample scattered complex fields, which are then processed to reconstruct high-resolution phase images. Using HISTR-SAPM, we are able to map the height profiles of subwavelength photonic structures and resolve the period structures that have 198 nm linewidth and 132 nm gap (i.e., a full pitch of 330 nm). As the reconstruction averages out laser speckle noise while maintaining high temporal resolution, HISTR-SAPM further enables imaging and quantification of nanoscale dynamics of live cells, such as red blood cell membrane fluctuations and subcellular structure dynamics within nucleated cells. We envision that HISTR-SAPM will broadly benefit research in material science and biology.",

Imaging polarimetry requires determination of the Mueller matrix (MM) at every point, providing a complete description of an object's vectorial properties. Despite forming a comprehensive representation, the MM does not usually provide easily interpretable information about the object's internal structure. Certain simpler vectorial metrics are derived from subsets of the MM elements. These metrics permit extraction of signatures that provide direct indicators of hidden optical properties of complex systems, while featuring an intriguing asymmetry about what information can or cannot be inferred via these metrics. We harness such characteristics to reveal the spin Hall effect of light, infer microscopic structure within laser-written photonic waveguides, and conduct rapid pathological diagnosis through analysis of healthy and cancerous tissue. This provides new insight for the broader usage of such asymmetric inferred vectorial information.",

    "abstract": "Transport of intensity equation (TIE) is a well-established non-interferometric phase retrieval approach that enables quantitative phase imaging (QPI) by simply measuring intensity images at multiple axially displaced planes. The advantage of a TIE-based QPI system is its compatibility with partially coherent illumination, which provides speckle-free imaging with resolution beyond the coherent diffraction limit. However, TIE is generally implemented with a brightfield (BF) configuration, and the maximum achievable imaging resolution is still limited to the incoherent diffraction limit (twice the coherent diffraction limit). It is desirable that TIE-related approaches can surpass this limit and achieve high-throughput [high-resolution and wide field of view (FOV)] QPI. We propose a hybrid BF and darkfield transport of intensity (HBDTI) approach for high-throughput quantitative phase microscopy. Two through-focus intensity stacks corresponding to BF and darkfield illuminations are acquired through a low-numerical-aperture (NA) objective lens. The high-resolution and large-FOV complex amplitude (both quantitative absorption and phase distributions) can then be synthesized based on an iterative phase retrieval algorithm taking the coherence model decomposition into account. The effectiveness of the proposed method is experimentally verified by the retrieval of the USAF resolution target and different types of biological cells. The experimental results demonstrate that the half-width imaging resolution can be improved from 1230 nm to 488 nm with 2.5 × expansion across a 4 × FOV of 7.19 mm2, corresponding to a 6.25 × increase in space-bandwidth product from ∼5 to ∼30.2 megapixels. In contrast to conventional TIE-based QPI methods where only BF illumination is used, the synthetic aperture process of HBDTI further incorporates darkfield illuminations to expand the accessible object frequency, thereby significantly extending the maximum available resolution from 2NA to ∼5NA with a ∼5 × promotion of the coherent diffraction limit. Given its capability for high-throughput QPI, the proposed HBDTI approach is expected to be adopted in biomedical fields, such as personalized genomics and cancer diagnostics.",

Due to the spin-orbit coupling, the mirror symmetry will be broken, and the handedness of the near-field source will determine the direction of energy transport. Compared with well-established theories about spin-momentum locking, experimental visualization of unidirectional coupling is usually challenging due to the lack of generic chiral sources and the strict environmental requirement. In this work, we design a broadband near-field chiral source in the microwave band and discuss experimental details to visualize spin-momentum locking in three different metamaterial waveguides, including spoof surface plasmon polaritons, line waves, and valley topological insulators. The similarity of these edge waves relies on the abrupt sign change of intrinsic characteristics of two media across the interface. In addition to the development of experimental technology, the advantages and research status of interface waveguides are summarized, and perspectives on future research are presented to explore an avenue for designing controllable spin-sorting devices in the microwave band.",

The formation of defect levels could suppress TQ, but rational synthesis and deep understanding of multiple defects-regulated luminescent materials working in such a wide temperature range still remain challenging. Here, we prepare a negative thermal quenching (NTQ) phosphor LiTaO3 : Tb3 + by introducing gradient defects VTa5−, TbLi2+, and ( VTaTbLi)3 − as identified by advanced experimental and theoretical studies. Its photoluminescence significantly becomes intense with rising temperatures and then slowly increases at 373 to 473 K. The mechanism studies reveal that gradient defects with varied trapping depths could act as energy buffer layers to effectively capture the carriers. Under thermal disturbance, the stored carriers could successively migrate to the activators in consecutive and wide temperature zones, compensating for TQ to enhance luminescence emission. This study initiates the synthesis of multi-defect NTQ phosphors for temperature-dependent applications.",

Due to the flexible programmability of the metasurface, a higher-order twist in the envelope wavefront structure of time-varying OAM beams can be further designed as an additional degree of freedom. The time-varying OAM field patterns are dynamically mapped by developing a two-probe measurement technique. Our approach in combining the programmability of space-time-coding digital metasurfaces and the two-probe measurement technique provides a versatile platform for generating and observing time-varying OAM and other spatiotemporal excitations in general.

In contrast, the heavy metal-free anti-perovskite materials [ MX4 ] XA3 (A = alkali metal; M = transition metal; X = Cl, Br, I), a class of electron-inverted perovskite derivatives, exhibit robust structural and photophysical stability. Here, we design and prepare a lead-free [ MnBr4 ] BrCs3 anti-perovskite nanocrystal (NC)-embedded glass for efficient X-ray-excited luminescence with high-resolution X-ray imaging with a spatial resolution of 19.1 lp mm − 1. Due to the unique crystal structure and the protection of the glass matrix, the Cs3MnBr5 NC-embedded glass exhibits excellent X-ray irradiation stability, thermal stability, and water resistance. These merits enable the demonstration of real-time and durable X-ray radiography based on the developed glassy composite. This work could stimulate the research and development of novel metal halide anti-perovskite materials and open a new path for future development in the field of high-resolution and ultrastable X-ray imaging.",

We propose an innovative solution to address the problem of wide FoV and extended unambiguous range using an acousto-optic modulator that rapidly scans a large-area metasurface deflector. We further exploit a multiplexing illumination technique traditionally deployed in the context of telecommunication theory to extend the ambiguity range and to drastically improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the measured signal.

It is highly desirable to be able to control TES transport in photonic implementations. Enhancing the coupling between the TESs in a finite-size optical lattice is capable of exchanging light energy between the boundaries of a topological lattice, hence facilitating the flexible control of TES transport. However, existing strategies have paid little attention to enhancing the coupling effects between the TESs through the finite-size effect. Here, we establish a bridge linking the interaction between the TESs in a finite-size optical lattice using the Landau–Zener model so as to provide an alternative way to modulate/control the transport of topological modes. We experimentally demonstrate an edge-to-edge topological transport with high efficiency at telecommunication wavelengths in silicon waveguide lattices.

Despite this, very few detectors have been able to distinguish photon numbers with both high fidelity and a large dynamic range, all while maintaining high speed and high timing precision. Superconducting nanostrip-based detectors excel at counting single photons efficiently and rapidly, but face challenges in balancing dynamic range and fidelity. Here, we have pioneered the demonstration of 10 true photon-number resolution using a superconducting microstrip detector, with readout fidelity reaching an impressive 98% and 90% for 4-photon and 6-photon events, respectively. Furthermore, our proposed dual-channel timing setup drastically reduces the amount of data acquisition by 3 orders of magnitude, allowing for real-time photon-number readout. We then demonstrate the utility of our scheme by implementing a quantum random-number generator based on sampling the parity of a coherent state, which guarantees inherent unbiasedness, robustness against experimental imperfections and environmental noise, as well as invulnerability to eavesdropping. Our solution boasts high fidelity, a large dynamic range, and real-time characterization for photon-number resolution and simplicity with respect to device structure, fabrication, and readout, which may provide a promising avenue towards optical quantum information science.",

Nevertheless, the persistent challenge of overcooling in static radiative techniques has raised concerns. Although a desirable solution is suggested based on vanadium dioxide (VO2) in the form of a Fabry–Perot (F–P) resonant cavity, the inherent contradiction between desired high emissivity (ε) and low solar absorptance (αsol) remains a notable limitation. Here, we employed a simple mask-filling technique to develop a temperature-adaptive metasurface radiative cooling device (ATMRD) for dynamic thermal regulation. Simulation and experimental results substantially evidenced that multiple localized polariton resonances were induced by the VO2 metasurface, significantly enhancing the thermal emittance of the ATMRDs. The engineered ATMRD achieved an amazing switch of the atmospheric window emittance from 0.13 to 0.85 when the surface temperature exceeds a pre-set transition temperature, accompanied by a commendable αsol of 27.71%. The mechanism of multiple localized polariton resonances is discussed in detail to understand the enhanced performance based on the investigation of the relationship between the metasurface structure and multiple localized polariton resonances. We demonstrate an efficient smart radiative technique achieved by a simple micro/nanoprocess and, most importantly, contribute a valuable reference for the design of radiative devices, which is crucial in various areas such as passive cooling, smart windows, multifunctional electromagnetic response, and space application technologies.",

Existing wide FOV metalenses show great potential for ultrathin optical components, but there is a set of tricky challenges, such as chromatic aberrations correction, central bright speckle removal, and image quality improvement of wide FOV. We design a neural meta-camera by introducing a knowledge-fused data-driven paradigm equipped with transformer-based network. Such a paradigm enables the network to sequentially assimilate the physical prior and experimental data of the metalens, and thus can effectively mitigate the aforementioned challenges. An ultra-wide FOV meta-camera, integrating an off-axis monochromatic aberration-corrected metalens with a neural CMOS image sensor without any relay lenses, is employed to demonstrate the availability. High-quality reconstructed results of color images and real scene images at different distances validate that the proposed meta-camera can achieve an ultra-wide FOV (>100 deg) and full-color images with the correction of chromatic aberration, distortion, and central bright speckle, and the contrast increase up to 13.5 times. Notably, coupled with its compact size (< 0.13 cm3), portability, and full-color imaging capacity, the neural meta-camera emerges as a compelling alternative for applications, such as micro-navigation, micro-endoscopes, and various on-chip devices.",

Ultrathin planar cavities are urgently in demand for large-area and integrated optical devices. However, extremely reducing the planar cavity dimension is a critical challenge, especially at telecommunication wavelengths. Herein, we demonstrate a type of ultrathin cavities based on large-area grown Bi2Te3 topological insulator (TI) nanofilms, which present distinct optical resonance in the near-infrared region. The result shows that the Bi2Te3 TI material presents ultrahigh refractive indices of >6 at telecommunication wavelengths. The cavity thickness can approach 1/20 of the resonance wavelength, superior to those of planar cavities based on conventional Si and Ge high refractive index materials. Moreover, we observed an analog of the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) effect at telecommunication wavelengths by depositing the cavity on a photonic crystal. The EIT-like behavior is derived from the destructive interference coupling between the nanocavity resonance and Tamm plasmons. The spectral response depends on the nanocavity thickness, whose adjustment enables the generation of obvious Fano resonance. The experiments agree well with the simulations. This work will open a new door for ultrathin cavities and applications of TI materials in light control and devices.",

A four-channel LNOI photonic chip for DWDM is designed and realized with a channel spacing of 1.6 nm (which is the narrowest one reported until now for LNOI optical transmitters), exhibiting a total excess loss of 1.3 dB and high 3-dB EO bandwidths of >67 GHz for all channels. Specifically, these four 2×2 FP cavities are designed with broadened LNOI photonic waveguides in the cavity sections, and they are placed very closely on the chip so that their resonance wavelengths are aligned precisely with the desired channel-spacing of ∼1.6 nm. Finally, the generation of 4×80-Gbps on–off keying and 4×100-Gbps PAM4 signals is demonstrated successfully with four channels, and the power consumption is as low as ∼5.1 fJ/bit. The present photonic chip has a compact footprint of about 0.78 mm×0.58 mm, showing great potential to work with more than four channels and to be very useful for future large-capacity optical links.",

However, they were previously generated either in strongly confined guided waves or in paraxial beams. This has posed a significant challenge in constructing skyrmions in nonparaxial propagating waves due to the lack of symmetry-breaking in the optical field and difficulty in characterizing the full three-dimensional spin textures at the nanoscale. We theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate the generation of skyrmionic spin textures in nonparaxial light, where skyrmionic textures with a Bloch-type scheme, including isolated skyrmioniums, skyrmion, and meron lattices are generated in free space. We introduce the interplay between the Hertz potentials to break the dual symmetry of light and build well-defined domains of skyrmions. We experimentally realized the topological textures by applying a hybrid polarized optical vortex and observed the complete three-dimensional spin distributions by a dual-mode waveguide probe. By bridging the gap in the skyrmionic group, we present a topologic diagram, showing how spin–orbit coupling of light governs the spin topology. These findings offer new insights into optical quasi-particles and electron–photon correspondence, potentially facilitating advanced applications in optical metrology, sensing, and storage.",

We report a subvoxel light-sheet microscopy (SLSM) method enabling high-throughput volumetric imaging of mesoscale specimens at cellular resolution. A nonaxial, continuous scanning strategy is developed to rapidly acquire a stack of large-FOV images with three-dimensional (3-D) nanoscale shifts encoded. Then, by adopting a subvoxel-resolving procedure, the SLSM method models these low-resolution, cross-correlated images in the spatial domain and can iteratively recover a 3-D image with improved resolution throughout the sample. This technique can surpass the optical limit of a conventional light-sheet microscope by more than three times, with high acquisition speeds of gigavoxels per minute. By fast reconstruction of 3-D cultured cells, intact organs, and live embryos, SLSM method presents a convenient way to circumvent the trade-off between mapping large-scale tissue (>100 mm3) and observing single cell (∼1-μm resolution). It also eliminates the need of complicated mechanical stitching or modulated illumination, using a simple light-sheet setup and fast graphics processing unit-based computation to achieve high-throughput, high-resolution 3-D microscopy, which could be tailored for a wide range of biomedical applications in pathology, histology, neuroscience, etc.",

    "abstract": "We accurately reconstruct three-dimensional (3-D) refractive index (RI) distributions from highly ill-posed two-dimensional (2-D) measurements using a deep neural network (DNN). Strong distortions are introduced on reconstructions obtained by the Wolf transform inversion method due to the ill-posed measurements acquired from the limited numerical apertures (NAs) of the optical system. Despite the recent success of DNNs in solving ill-posed inverse problems, the application to 3-D optical imaging is particularly challenging due to the lack of the ground truth. We overcome this limitation by generating digital phantoms that serve as samples for the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) to generate multiple 2-D projection maps for a limited range of illumination angles. The presented samples are red blood cells (RBCs), which are highly affected by the ill-posed problems due to their morphology. The trained network using synthetic measurements from the digital phantoms successfully eliminates the introduced distortions. Most importantly, we obtain high fidelity reconstructions from experimentally recorded projections of real RBC sample using the network that was trained on digitally generated RBC phantoms. Finally, we confirm the reconstruction accuracy using the DDA to calculate the 2-D projections of the 3-D reconstructions and compare them to the experimentally recorded projections.",

    "abstract": "The Abbe diffraction limit, which relates the maximum optical resolution to the numerical aperture of the lenses involved and the optical wavelength, is generally considered a practical limit that cannot be overcome with conventional imaging systems. However, it does not represent a fundamental limit to optical resolution, as demonstrated by several new imaging techniques that prove the possibility of finding the subwavelength information from the far field of an optical image. These include super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, imaging systems that use new data processing algorithms to obtain dramatically improved resolution, and the use of super-oscillating metamaterial lenses. This raises the key question of whether there is in fact a fundamental limit to the optical resolution, as opposed to practical limitations due to noise and imperfections, and if so then what it is. We derive the fundamental limit to the resolution of optical imaging and demonstrate that while a limit to the resolution of a fundamental nature does exist, contrary to the conventional wisdom it is neither exactly equal to nor necessarily close to Abbe’s estimate. Furthermore, our approach to imaging resolution, which combines the tools from the physics of wave phenomena and the methods of information theory, is general and can be extended beyond optical microscopy, e.g., to geophysical and ultrasound imaging.",

Distribution of photonic entangled states using optical fiber links is a fundamental building block towards quantum networks. Among the different degrees of freedom, orbital angular momentum (OAM) is one of the most promising due to its natural capability to encode high dimensional quantum states. In this article, we experimentally demonstrate fiber distribution of hybrid polarization-vector vortex entangled photon pairs. To this end, we exploit a recently developed air-core fiber which supports OAM modes. High fidelity distribution of the entangled states is demonstrated by performing quantum state tomography in the polarization-OAM Hilbert space after fiber propagation, and by violations of Bell inequalities and multipartite entanglement tests. The present results open new scenarios for quantum applications where correlated complex states can be transmitted by exploiting the vectorial nature of light.",

Their superior material and optical properties are shared by the counterpart colloidal nanocrystals (NCs), with the additional advantage of quantum confinement that can yield size-dependent optical emission ranging from the near-UV to near-infrared wavelengths. So far, intensive research efforts have been devoted to the optical characterization of perovskite NC ensembles, revealing not only fundamental exciton relaxation and recombination dynamics but also low-threshold amplified spontaneous emission and novel superfluorescence effects. Meanwhile, the application of single-particle spectroscopy techniques to perovskite NCs has helped to resolve a variety of optical properties for which there are few equivalents in traditional colloidal NCs, mainly including nonblinking photoluminescence, suppressed spectral diffusion, stable exciton fine structures, and coherent single-photon emission. While the main purpose of ensemble optical studies is to guide the smooth development of perovskite NCs in classical optoelectronic applications, the rich observations from single-particle optical studies mark the emergence of a potential platform that can be exploited for quantum information technologies.",

    "abstract": "Integrated photonics provides a route to both miniaturization of quantum key distribution (QKD) devices and enhancing their performance. A key element for achieving discrete-variable QKD is a single-photon detector. It is highly desirable to integrate detectors onto a photonic chip to enable the realization of practical and scalable quantum networks. We realize a heterogeneously integrated, superconducting silicon-photonic chip. Harnessing the unique high-speed feature of our optical waveguide-integrated superconducting detector, we perform the first optimal Bell-state measurement (BSM) of time-bin encoded qubits generated from two independent lasers. The optimal BSM enables an increased key rate of measurement-device-independent QKD (MDI-QKD), which is immune to all attacks against the detection system and hence provides the basis for a QKD network with untrusted relays. Together with the time-multiplexed technique, we have enhanced the sifted key rate by almost one order of magnitude. With a 125-MHz clock rate, we obtain a secure key rate of 6.166 kbps over 24.0 dB loss, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art MDI-QKD experimental results with a GHz clock rate. Combined with integrated QKD transmitters, a scalable, chip-based, and cost-effective QKD network should become realizable in the near future.",

Midinfrared light has several features of utter relevance for free-space applications: low absorption when propagating in the atmosphere even under adverse conditions, robustness of the wavefront during long-distance propagation, and absence of regulations and restrictions for this range of wavelengths. A proof-of-concept of high-speed transmission taking advantage of intersubband devices has recently been demonstrated, but this effort was limited by the short-distance optical path (up to 1 m). In this work, we study the possibility of building a long-range link using unipolar quantum optoelectronics. Two different detectors are used: an uncooled quantum cascade detector and a nitrogen-cooled quantum well-infrared photodetector. We evaluate the maximum data rate of our link in a back-to-back configuration before adding a Herriott cell to increase the length of the light path up to 31 m. By using pulse shaping, pre- and post-processing, we reach a record bitrate of 30 Gbit s − 1 for both two-level (OOK) and four-level (PAM-4) modulation schemes for a 31-m propagation link and a bit error rate compatible with error-correction codes.",

We present an intracavity second harmonic generation (SHG) of laser beams in transverse mode locking (TML) states with a specially designed sandwich such as a microchip laser. The intracavity nonlinear frequency conversion process of a laser beam in a TML state to its second harmonic is theoretically and experimentally investigated, considering different relative phase and weight parameters between the basic modes in the TML beam. Comparison between the far-field SHG beam patterns of fundamental frequency transverse modes in coherently locked and incoherently superposed states demonstrates that the SHG of TML beams can carry more information. Various rarely observed far-field SHG beam patterns are obtained, and they are consistent with the theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. With the obtained SHG beams, the characteristics of the structured fundamental frequency beams can also be conversely investigated or predicted.

As demonstrated, the light-controllable time-domain digital coding metasurface is illuminated by the light signals with two designed time-coding sequences. The measured results show that the metasurface can well generate symmetrical harmonics and white-noise-like spectra, respectively, under such cases in the reflected wave.

Pure organic materials have recently emerged as promising scintillators for X-ray detection and radiography, due to their diversified design, low cost, and facile preparation. However, recent progress in efficient radioluminescence has mainly focused on small molecules, which are inevitably associated with processability and repeatability issues. Here, a concise strategy is proposed to prepare radioluminescent polymers that exhibit multiple emission colors from blue to yellow with high brightness in an amorphous state by the radical copolymerization of negatively charged polyacrylic acid and different positively charged quaternary phosphonium salts. One of the obtained polymers exhibits excellent photostability under a high X-ray irradiation dosage of 27.35 Gy and has a detection limit of 149 nGy s − 1. This performance is superior to that of conventional anthracene-based scintillators. Furthermore, by simply drop-casting a polymer methanol solution on a quartz plate, a transparent scintillator screen was successfully fabricated for X-ray imaging with a resolution of 8.7 line pairs mm − 1. The pure organic phosphorescent polymers with a highly efficient radioluminescence were demonstrated for the first time, and the strategy reported herein offers a promising pathway to expand the application range of amorphous organic scintillators.",

Experimentally, extracting such dynamics at its natural (attosecond) timescale is quite difficult. We report the first such experiment in a linear carbon-chain molecule, butadiyne (C4H2), via high-harmonic spectroscopy (HHS). By employing advanced theoretical and computational tools, we showed that the wave packet and the CM of a single molecule are reconstructed from the harmonic spectra for each fixed-in-space angle of the molecule. For this one-dimensional molecule, we calculate the center of charge ⟨ x ⟩ ( t ) to obtain vcm, to quantify the migration speed and how it depends on the orientation angle. The findings also uncover how the electron dynamics at the first few tens to hundreds of attoseconds depends on molecular structure. The method can be extended to other molecules where the HHS technique can be employed.",

    "abstract": "Microcombs are revolutionizing optoelectronics by providing parallel, mutually coherent wavelength channels for time-frequency metrology and information processing. To implement this essential function in integrated photonic systems, it is desirable to drive microcombs directly with an on-chip laser in a simple and flexible way. However, two major difficulties have prevented this goal: (1) generating mode-locked comb states usually requires a significant amount of pump power and (2) the requirement to align laser and resonator frequency significantly complicates operation and limits the tunability of the comb lines. Here, we address these problems by using microresonators on an AlGaAs on-insulator platform to generate dark-pulse microcombs. This highly nonlinear platform dramatically relaxes fabrication requirements and leads to a record-low pump power of <1 mW for coherent comb generation. Dark-pulse microcombs facilitated by thermally controlled avoided mode crossings are accessed by direct distributed feedback laser pumping. Without any feedback or control circuitries, the comb shows good coherence and stability. With around 150 mW on-chip power, this approach also leads to an unprecedentedly wide tuning range of over one free spectral range (97.5 GHz). Our work provides a route to realize power-efficient, simple, and reconfigurable microcombs that can be seamlessly integrated with a wide range of photonic systems.",

We show the feasibility of on-chip GVD engineering by introducing a gradient-index metamaterial structure, which enables a robust and fully scalable MDM process. We demonstrate a record-high-order MDM device that supports TE0–TE15 modes simultaneously. 40-GBaud 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulation signals encoded on 16 mode channels contribute to a 2.162 Tbit / s net data rate, which is the highest data rate ever reported for an on-chip single-wavelength transmission.

    "abstract": "Scattering of waves, e.g., light, due to medium inhomogeneity is ubiquitous in physics and is considered detrimental for many applications. Wavefront shaping technology is a powerful tool to defeat scattering and focus light through inhomogeneous media, which is vital for optical imaging, communication, therapy, etc. Wavefront shaping based on the scattering matrix (SM) is extremely useful in handling dynamic processes in the linear regime. However, the implementation of such a method for controlling light in nonlinear media is still a challenge and has been unexplored until now. We report a method to determine the SM of nonlinear scattering media with second-order nonlinearity. We experimentally demonstrate its feasibility in wavefront control and realize focusing of nonlinear signals through strongly scattering quadratic media. Moreover, we show that statistical properties of this SM still follow the random matrix theory. The scattering-matrix approach of nonlinear scattering medium opens a path toward nonlinear signal recovery, nonlinear imaging, microscopic object tracking, and complex environment quantum information processing.",

    "abstract": "Diverse spatial mode bases can be exploited in mode-division multiplexing (MDM) to sustain the capacity growth in fiber-optic communications, such as linearly polarized (LP) modes, vector modes, LP orbital angular momentum (LP-OAM) modes, and circularly polarized OAM (CP-OAM) modes. Nevertheless, which kind of mode bases is more appropriate to be utilized in fiber still remains unclear. Here, we aim to find the superior mode basis in MDM fiber-optic communications via a system-level comparison in air-core fiber (ACF). We first investigate the walk-off effect of four spatial mode bases over 1-km ACF, where LP and LP-OAM modes show intrinsic mode walk-off, while it is negligible for vector and CP-OAM modes. We then study the mode coupling effect of degenerate vector and CP-OAM modes over 1-km ACF under fiber perturbations, where degenerate even and odd vector modes suffer severe mode cross talk, while negligible for high-order degenerate CP-OAM modes based on the laws of angular momentum conservation. Moreover, we comprehensively evaluate the system-level performance for data-carrying single-channel and two-channel MDM transmission with different spatial mode bases under various kinds of fiber perturbations (bending, twisting, pressing, winding, and out-of-plane moving). The obtained results indicate that the CP-OAM mode basis shows superiority compared to other mode bases in MDM fiber-optic communications without using multiple-input multiple-output digital signal processing. Our findings may pave the way for robust short-reach MDM optical interconnects for data centers and high-performance computing.",

However, existing superoscillatory lenses for spatial superresolution imaging systems still confront critical performance limitations due to the lack of advanced design methods and limited design degree of freedom. Here, we propose an optical superoscillatory diffractive neural network (SODNN) that achieves spatial superresolution for imaging beyond the diffraction limit with superior optical performance. SODNN is constructed by utilizing diffractive layers for optical interconnections and imaging samples or biological sensors for nonlinearity. This modulates the incident optical field to create optical superoscillation effects in three-dimensional (3D) space and generate the superresolved focal spots. By optimizing diffractive layers with 3D optical field constraints under an incident wavelength size of λ, we achieved a superoscillatory optical spot and needle with a full width at half-maximum of 0.407λ at the far-field distance over 400λ without sidelobes over the field of view and with a long depth of field over 10λ. Furthermore, the SODNN implements a multiwavelength and multifocus spot array that effectively avoids chromatic aberrations, achieving comprehensive performance improvement that surpasses the trade-off among performance indicators of conventional superoscillatory lens design methods. Our research work will inspire the development of intelligent optical instruments to facilitate the applications of imaging, sensing, perception, etc.",

We overcame the problem of dispersion management by utilizing the huge normal dispersion generated near the absorption edge of an infrared-bandgap semiconductor and promoted MLFFL from soliton to breathing-pulse mode-locking. In the breathing-pulse regime, the accumulated nonlinear phase shift can be significantly reduced in the cavity, and the pulse-energy-limitation effect is mitigated. The breathing-pulse MLFFL directly produced a pulse energy of 9.3 nJ and pulse duration of 215 fs, with a record peak power of 43.3 kW at 2.8 μm. Our work paves the way for the pulse-energy and peak-power scaling of mid-IR fluoride fiber lasers, enabling a wide range of applications.",

    "abstract": "Ultrafast lasers generating high-repetition-rate ultrashort pulses through various mode-locking methods can benefit many important applications, including communications, materials processing, astronomical observation, etc. For decades, mode-locking based on dissipative four-wave-mixing (DFWM) has been fundamental in producing pulses with repetition rates on the order of gigahertz (GHz), where multiwavelength comb filters and long nonlinear components are elemental. Recently, this method has been improved using filter-driven DFWM, which exploits both the filtering and nonlinear features of silica microring resonators. However, the fabrication complexity and coupling loss between waveguides and fibers are problematic. We demonstrate a tens- to hundreds- of gigahertz-stable pulsed all-fiber laser based on a hybrid plasmonic microfiber knot resonator device. Unlike previously reported pulse generation mechanisms, the operation utilizes the nonlinear-polarization-rotation (NPR) effect introduced by the polarization-dependent feature of the device to increase intracavity power for boosting DFWM mode-locking, which we term NPR-stimulated DFWM. The easily fabricated versatile device acts as a polarizer, comb filter, and nonlinear component simultaneously, thereby introducing an application of microfiber resonator devices in ultrafast and nonlinear photonics. We believe that our work underpins a significant improvement in achieving practical low-cost ultrafast light sources.",

We propose and demonstrate subwavelength optical imaging in one-dimensional silicon waveguide arrays, which is implemented by cascading straight and curved waveguides in sequence. The coupling coefficient between the curved waveguides is tuned to be negative to reach a negative dispersion, which is an analog to a hyperbolic metamaterial with a negative refractive index. Therefore, it endows the waveguide array with a superlens function as it is connected with a traditional straight waveguide array with positive dispersion. With a judiciously engineered cascading silicon waveguide array, we successfully show the subwavelength self-imaging process of each input port of the waveguide array as the single point source. Our approach provides a strategy for dealing with optical signals at the subwavelength scale and indicates functional designs in high-density waveguide integrations.",

We present a method for analyzing water-rich samples via time-domain terahertz optoacoustics over a 104-fold thickness ranging from microns to centimeters. We demonstrate that adjusting the temperature to alter the terahertz optoacoustic (THz-OA) signal of water improves the sensitivity with which it can be analyzed and, conversely, can reduce or even \"silence\" its signal. Temperature-manipulated THz-OA signals of aqueous solutions allow detection of solutes such as ions with an order of magnitude greater sensitivity than terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, and potentially provide more characteristic parameters related to both terahertz absorption and ultrasonic propagation.

Here, we report quantum interference between two single photons from independent QDs separated by a 302 km optical fiber. The single photons are generated from resonantly driven single QDs deterministically coupled to microcavities. Quantum frequency conversions are used to eliminate the QD inhomogeneity and shift the emission wavelength to the telecommunication band. The observed interference visibility is 0.67 ± 0.02 (0.93 ± 0.04) without (with) temporal filtering. Feasible improvements can further extend the distance to ∼600 km.

Indeed, due to its unbounded nature, OAM is suitable for encoding qudits, allowing a single carrier to transport a large amount of information. Most of the experimental platforms employ spontaneous parametric down-conversion processes to generate single photons, even if this approach is intrinsically probabilistic, leading to scalability issues for an increasing number of qudits. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have been used to get over these limitations by producing on-demand pure and indistinguishable single-photon states, although only recently they have been exploited to create OAM modes. Our work employs a bright QD single-photon source to generate a complete set of quantum states for information processing with OAM-endowed photons. We first study hybrid intraparticle entanglement between OAM and polarization degrees of freedom of a single photon whose preparation was certified by means of Hong–Ou–Mandel visibility. Then, we investigate hybrid interparticle OAM-based entanglement by exploiting a probabilistic entangling gate. The performance of our approach is assessed by performing quantum state tomography and violating Bell inequalities. Our results pave the way for the use of deterministic sources for the on-demand generation of photonic high-dimensional quantum states.",

    "abstract": "Free-space optical information transfer through diffusive media is critical in many applications, such as biomedical devices and optical communication, but remains challenging due to random, unknown perturbations in the optical path. We demonstrate an optical diffractive decoder with electronic encoding to accurately transfer the optical information of interest, corresponding to, e.g., any arbitrary input object or message, through unknown random phase diffusers along the optical path. This hybrid electronic-optical model, trained using supervised learning, comprises a convolutional neural network-based electronic encoder and successive passive diffractive layers that are jointly optimized. After their joint training using deep learning, our hybrid model can transfer optical information through unknown phase diffusers, demonstrating generalization to new random diffusers never seen before. The resulting electronic-encoder and optical-decoder model was experimentally validated using a 3D-printed diffractive network that axially spans <70λ, where λ = 0.75 mm is the illumination wavelength in the terahertz spectrum, carrying the desired optical information through random unknown diffusers. The presented framework can be physically scaled to operate at different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, without retraining its components, and would offer low-power and compact solutions for optical information transfer in free space through unknown random diffusive media.",

Addressing the challenge of double circular polarization superposition resulting from the high refractive index contrast, we regulate the transverse spin state through a newly designed second-order grating partially etched on the waveguide's top side. The reflected wave can be received directly by a linearly polarized antenna, simplifying the process. Benefiting from the tuning feature, a joint detection method involving positive and negative topological charges identifies and detects rotational Doppler effects amid robust micro-Doppler interference signals. This emitter can be used for the rotational velocity measurement of an on-axis spinning object, achieving an impressive maximum speed error rate of ∼2 % . This approach holds promise for the future development of THz vortex beam applications in radar target detection and countermeasure systems, given its low cost and potential for mass production.",

The existing deep-learning methods for holographic imaging often depend solely on the specific condition based on the given data distributions, thus hindering their generalization across multiple scenes. One critical problem is how to guarantee the alignment between any given downstream tasks and pretrained models. We analyze the physical mechanism of image degradation caused by turbulence and innovatively propose a swin transformer-based method, termed train-with-coherence-swin (TWC-Swin) transformer, which uses spatial coherence (SC) as an adaptable physical prior information to precisely align image restoration tasks in the arbitrary turbulent scene. The light-processing system (LPR) we designed enables manipulation of SC and simulation of any turbulence. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the TWC-Swin method presents superiority over traditional convolution frameworks and realizes image restoration under various turbulences, which suggests its robustness, powerful generalization capabilities, and adaptability to unknown environments. Our research reveals the significance of physical prior information in the optical intersection and provides an effective solution for model-to-tasks alignment schemes, which will help to unlock the full potential of deep learning for all-weather optical imaging across terrestrial, marine, and aerial domains.",

However, clear identification and manipulation of their individual contributions in the light-induced RSE process remain experimentally challenging. Here, we bridge this gap by exploring the dissociative and nondissociative RSE of H2 molecules using bicircular two-color laser pulses. Depending on the relative field strength and polarization helicity of the two colors, the RSE probability can be boosted by more than one order of magnitude by exploiting the laser waveform-dependent field effect. The role of the photon effect is readily strengthened with increasing relative strength of the second-harmonic field of the two colors regardless of the polarization helicity. As compared to the nondissociative RSE forming H2 * , the field effect in producing the dissociative RSE channel of ( H + , H * ) is moderately suppressed, which is primarily accessed via a three-step sequential process separated by molecular bond stretching. Our work paves the way toward a comprehensive understanding of the interplay of the underlying field and photon effects in the strong-field RSE process, as well as facilitating the generation of Rydberg states optimized with tailored characteristics.",

A long-sought solution to achieve tunability at the nanoscale is all-optical modulation by exploiting the ultrafast nonlinear response of materials. However, the nonlinear response of materials is inherently very weak, and, therefore, requires optical excitations with large values of fluence. We show that by properly tuning the equilibrium optical response of a nonlocal metasurface, it is possible to achieve sizable variation of the photoinduced out-of-equilibrium optical response on the picosecond timescale employing fluences smaller than 250 μJ / cm2, which is 1 order of magnitude lower than previous studies with comparable reflectivity variations in silicon platforms.

Here, we present a unique phase-modulated stimulated Raman scattering tomography (PM-SRST) technique to achieve rapid label-free 3D chemical imaging in cells and tissue. To accomplish PM-SRST, we utilize a spatial light modulator to electronically manipulate the focused Stokes beam along the needle Bessel pump beam for SRS tomography without the need for mechanical z scanning. We demonstrate the rapid 3D imaging capability of PM-SRST by real-time monitoring of 3D Brownian motion of polystyrene beads in water with 8.5 Hz volume rate, as well as the instant biochemical responses to acetic acid stimulants in MCF-7 cells. Further, combining the Bessel pump beam with a longer wavelength Stokes beam (NIR-II window) provides a superior scattering resilient ability in PM-SRST, enabling rapid tomography in deeper tissue areas. The PM-SRST technique provides ∼twofold enhancement in imaging depth in highly scattering media (e.g., polymer beads phantom and biotissue like porcine skin and brain tissue) compared with conventional point-scan SRS. We also demonstrate the rapid 3D imaging ability of PM-SRST by observing the dynamic diffusion and uptake processes of deuterium oxide molecules into plant roots. The rapid PM-SRST developed can be used to facilitate label-free 3D chemical imaging of metabolic activities and functional dynamic processes of drug delivery and therapeutics in live cells and tissue.",

Removing undesired structure from light is far less developed, leveraging mostly on inverting the distortion, e.g., with adaptive optics or the inverse transmission matrix of a complex channel, both requiring that the distortion be fully characterized through appropriate measurement. We show that distortions in spatially structured light can be corrected through difference-frequency generation in a nonlinear crystal without any need for the distortion to be known. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach using a wide range of aberrations and structured light modes, including higher-order orbital angular momentum (OAM) beams, showing excellent recovery of the original undistorted field. To highlight the efficacy of this process, we deploy the system in a prepare-and-measure communications link with OAM, showing minimal cross talk even when the transmission channel is highly aberrated, and outline how the approach could be extended to alternative experimental modalities and nonlinear processes. Our demonstration of light-correcting light without the need for measurement opens an approach to measurement-free error correction for classical and quantum structured light, with direct applications in imaging, sensing, and communication.",

    "abstract": "A key concept underlying the specific functionalities of metasurfaces, i.e. arrays of subwavelength nanoparticles, is the use of constituent components to shape the wavefront of the light, on-demand. Metasurfaces are versatile and novel platforms to manipulate the scattering, colour, phase or the intensity of the light. Currently, one of the typical approaches for designing a metasurface is to optimize one or two variables, among a vast number of fixed parameters, such as various materials' properties and coupling effects, as well as the geometrical parameters. Ideally, it would require a multi-dimensional space optimization through direct numerical simulations. Recently, an alternative approach became quite popular allowing to reduce the computational cost significantly based on a deep-learning-assisted method. In this paper, we utilize a deep-learning approach for obtaining high-quality factor (high-Q) resonances with desired characteristics, such as linewidth, amplitude and spectral position. We exploit such high-Q resonances for the enhanced light-matter interaction in nonlinear optical metasurfaces and optomechanical vibrations, simultaneously. We demonstrate that optimized metasurfaces lead up to 400+ folds enhancement of the third harmonic generation (THG); at the same time, they also contribute to 100+ folds enhancement in optomechanical vibrations. This approach can be further used to realize structures with unconventional scattering responses.",

From the virtual shadowed images, we can further recover the phase distribution of a transparent object with the accuracy of 0.05λ RMS.

    "abstract": "The ability to generate and manipulate broadband chiral terahertz waves is essential for applications in material imaging, terahertz sensing, and diagnosis. It can also open up new possibilities for nonlinear terahertz spectroscopy and coherent control of chiral molecules and magnetic materials. The existing methods, however, often suffer from low efficiency, narrow bandwidth, or poor flexibility. Here, we propose a novel type of laser-driven terahertz emitters, consisting of metasurface-patterned magnetic multilayer heterostructures, that can overcome the shortcomings of the conventional approaches. Such hybrid terahertz emitters combine the advantages of spintronic emitters for being ultrabroadband, efficient, and highly flexible, as well as those of metasurfaces for the powerful control capabilities over the polarization state of emitted terahertz waves on an ultracompact platform. Taking a stripe-patterned metasurface as an example, we demonstrate the efficient generation and manipulation of broadband chiral terahertz waves. The ellipticity can reach >0.75 over a broad terahertz bandwidth (1 to 5 THz), representing a high-quality and efficient source for few-cycle circularly polarized terahertz pulses with stable carrier waveforms. Flexible control of ellipticity and helicity is also demonstrated with our systematic experiments and numerical simulations. We show that the terahertz polarization state is dictated by the interplay between laser-induced spintronic-origin currents and the screening charges/currents in the metasurfaces, which exhibits tailored anisotropic properties due to the predesigned geometric confinement effects. Our work opens a new pathway to metasurface-tailored spintronic emitters for efficient vector-control of electromagnetic waves in the terahertz regime.",

Two important Raman spectral regions are the chemically specific \"fingerprint\" (200 to 1800 cm − 1) and \"low-frequency\" or \"terahertz\" (THz) (<200 cm − 1; <6 THz) regions, which mostly contain intramolecular and intermolecular vibrations, respectively. These two regions are highly complementary; broadband simultaneous measurement of both regions can provide a big picture comprising information about molecular structures and interactions. Although techniques for acquiring broadband Raman spectra covering both regions have been demonstrated, these methods tend to have spectral acquisition rates <10 spectra / s, prohibiting high-speed applications, such as Raman imaging or vibrational detection of transient phenomena. Here, we demonstrate a single-laser method for ultrafast (24,000 spectra / s) broadband Raman spectroscopy covering both THz and fingerprint regions. This is achieved by simultaneous detection of Sagnac-enhanced impulsive stimulated Raman scattering (SE-ISRS; THz-sensitive) and Fourier-transform coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (FT-CARS; fingerprint-sensitive). With dual-detection impulsive vibrational spectroscopy, the SE-ISRS signal shows a >500 × enhancement of <6.5 THz sensitivity compared with that of FT-CARS, and the FT-CARS signal shows a >10 × enhancement of fingerprint sensitivity above 1000 cm − 1 compared with that of SE-ISRS.",

FI-SIM can acquire images quickly within the order of hundreds of milliseconds and exhibit even 30 nm axial resolution in half the wavelength depth range without z-axis scanning. Moreover, the relatively low laser power density relaxes the requirements for dyes and enables a wide range of applications for observing fixed and live subcellular structures.",

However, breaking the diffraction-limited spatial resolution of SRS imaging is much more challenging because of the intrinsically weak scattering cross section and inert/stable nature of molecular bond vibrations. We report superresolution SRS (SR-SRS) nanoscopy based on reversible-switchable vibrational photochromic probes integrated with point spread function engineering strategy. By introducing a Gaussian-shaped ultraviolet excitation beam and a donut-shaped visible depletion beam in addition to the pump and Stokes beams, SR-SRS could reach sub-100 nm resolution on photoswitchable nanoparticles (NPs). Furthermore, NP-treated live cell imaging was demonstrated with resolution improvement by a factor of ∼4. Our proof-of-principle work provides the potential for SR vibrational imaging to assist research on complex biological systems.",

However, achieving simultaneous low-dimensionality, high-speed controllability, and on-demand reconfigurability of the polaritons remains unexplored despite their excellent potential in light–matter interactions, photonic integrated circuits, and optoelectronic devices. Here, we propose a metasurface approach to integrating artificially engineered electromagnetic anisotropy with fast-controllable electronic elements, offering a new route to realize active topological polaritons. Experiments showcase the proposed reconfigurable metasurface can support real-time transitions of designer polaritons from elliptical to flat, and then to hyperbolic and circular isofrequency contours. Correspondingly, the in-plane surface wavefront undergoes the transitions from convex to collimating, concave, and eventually back to convex. By exploiting the topological variations in polariton dispersions, we observe intriguing phenomena of controllable field canalization and tunable planar focusing. Furthermore, we report the concept of a planar reconfigurable integrated polariton circuit by spatially tailoring the distributions of polariton isofrequency contours, unveiling rich dispersion engineering possibilities and active control capabilities. We may provide an inspiring platform for developing planar active plasmonic devices with potential applications in subdiffraction-resolution imaging, sensing, and information processing.",

Despite these strides, the integration of such algorithms into scientists' daily routines and clinical trials remains limited, largely due to a lack of recognition within their respective fields and the plethora of available transformation methods. To address this, we present a structured overview of cross-modality transformations, encompassing applications, data sets, and implementations, aimed at unifying this evolving field. Our review focuses on DL solutions for two key applications: contrast enhancement of targeted features within images and resolution enhancements. We recognize cross-modality transformations as a valuable resource for biologists seeking a deeper understanding of the field, as well as for technology developers aiming to better grasp sample limitations and potential applications. Notably, they enable high-contrast, high-specificity imaging akin to fluorescence microscopy without the need for laborious, costly, and disruptive physical-staining procedures. In addition, they facilitate the realization of imaging with properties that would typically require costly or complex physical modifications, such as achieving superresolution capabilities. By consolidating the current state of research in this review, we aim to catalyze further investigation and development, ultimately bringing the potential of cross-modality transformations into the hands of researchers and clinicians alike.",

Various applications of microlasers, such as optical communication, optical storage, and polarization imaging, require selecting the appropriate laser polarization mode and remote control of the laser properties. Here, we propose a unique plasmon-assisted method for the mode selection and remote control of microlasing using a lanthanide-based microcavity coupled with surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) that propagate on a silver microplate. With this method, the transverse electrical (TE) mode of microlasers can be easily separated from the transverse magnetic (TM) mode. Because the SPPs excited on the silver microplate only support TM mode propagation, the reserved TE mode is resonance-enhanced in the microcavity and amplified by the local electromagnetic field. Meanwhile, lasing-mode splitting can be observed under the near-field excitation of SPPs due to the coherent coupling between the microcavity and mirror microcavity modes. Benefiting from the long-distance propagation characteristics of tens of micrometers of SPPs on a silver microplate, remote excitation and control of upconversion microlasing can also be realized. These plasmon-assisted polarization mode-optional and remote-controllable upconversion microlasers have promising prospects in on-chip optoelectronic devices, encrypted optical information transmission, and high-precision sensors.",

The structure of perovskite optoelectronic devices includes the perovskite active layer, electron transport layer, and hole transport layer. This indicates that the optimization process unfolds as a complex interplay between intricate chemical crystallization processes and sophisticated physical mechanisms. Traditional research in perovskite optoelectronics has mainly depended on trial-and-error experimentation, a less efficient approach. Recently, the emergence of machine learning (ML) has drastically streamlined the optimization process. Due to its powerful data processing capabilities, ML has significant advantages in uncovering potential patterns and making predictions. More importantly, ML can reveal underlying patterns in data and elucidate complex device mechanisms, playing a pivotal role in enhancing device performance. We present the latest advancements in applying ML to perovskite optoelectronic devices, covering perovskite active layers, transport layers, interface engineering, and mechanisms.

We present measurements of an X-band RF TDS system with variable polarization with a resolution below one femtosecond. We show FEL power profile measurements with associated root mean square pulse durations as short as 300 attoseconds. The measurements have been carried out at Athos, the soft X-ray beamline of SwissFEL.

Meanwhile, optical lattices have emerged as a versatile toolbox for understanding the properties and controlling the dynamics of BEC, among which the realization of bright gap solitons is an iconic result. However, the dark gap solitons are still experimentally unproven, and their properties in more than one dimension remain unknown. In light of this, we describe, numerically and theoretically, the formation and stability properties of gap-type dark localized modes in the context of ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices. Two kinds of stable dark localized modes--gap solitons and soliton clusters--are predicted in both the one- and two-dimensional geometries. The vortical counterparts of both modes are also constructed in two dimensions. A unique feature is the existence of a nonlinear Bloch-wave background on which all above gap modes are situated. By employing linear-stability analysis and direct simulations, stability regions of the predicted modes are obtained. Our results offer the possibility of observing dark gap localized structures with cutting-edge techniques in ultracold atoms experiments and beyond, including in optics with photonic crystals and lattices.",

A recently reported approach suggests an experimentally viable platform for topological graphene plasmonics by introducing nanopatterned gates—metagates. We propose a metagate-tuned GPP platform emulating a second-order topological crystalline insulator. The metagate imprints its crystalline symmetry onto graphene by modulating its chemical potential via field-effect gating. Depending on the gate geometry and applied voltage, the resulting two-dimensional crystal supports either one-dimensional chiral edge states or zero-dimensional midgap corner states.

These properties have been demonstrated under resonant two-photon excitation (TPE) and at operation temperatures below 10 K. However, source blinking is often reported under TPE conditions, limiting the maximum achievable photon rate. In addition, operation temperatures reachable with compact cryocoolers could facilitate the widespread deployment of QDs, e.g., in satellite-based quantum communication. We demonstrate blinking-free emission of highly entangled photon pairs from GaAs QDs embedded in a p-i-n diode. High fidelity entanglement persists at temperatures of at least 20 K, which we use to implement fiber-based QKD between two buildings with an average raw key rate of 55 bits / s and a qubit error rate of 8.4%.

    "abstract": "Perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are considered as promising candidates for next-generation solution-processed full-color displays. However, the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) and operational stabilities of deep-blue (<460 nm) PeLEDs still lag far behind their red and green counterparts. Herein, a rapid crystallization method based on hot-antisolvent bathing is proposed for realization of deep-blue PeLEDs. By promoting immediate removal of the precursor solvent from the wet perovskite films, development of the quasi-two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden–Popper perovskite (2D-RPP) crystals with n values >3 is hampered completely, so that phase-pure 2D-RPP films with bandgaps suitable for deep-blue PeLEDs can be obtained successfully. The uniquely developed rapid crystallization method also enables formation of randomly oriented 2D-RPP crystals, thereby improving the transfer and transport kinetics of the charge carriers. Thus, high-performance deep-blue PeLEDs emitting at 437 nm with a peak EQE of 0.63% are successfully demonstrated. The color coordinates are confirmed to be (0.165, 0.044), which match well with the Rec.2020 standard blue gamut and have excellent spectral stability.",

    "abstract": "Various super-resolution microscopy techniques have been presented to explore fine structures of biological specimens. However, the super-resolution capability is often achieved at the expense of reducing imaging speed by either point scanning or multiframe computation. The contradiction between spatial resolution and imaging speed seriously hampers the observation of high-speed dynamics of fine structures. To overcome this contradiction, here we propose and demonstrate a temporal compressive super-resolution microscopy (TCSRM) technique. This technique is to merge an enhanced temporal compressive microscopy and a deep-learning-based super-resolution image reconstruction, where the enhanced temporal compressive microscopy is utilized to improve the imaging speed, and the deep-learning-based super-resolution image reconstruction is used to realize the resolution enhancement. The high-speed super-resolution imaging ability of TCSRM with a frame rate of 1200 frames per second (fps) and spatial resolution of 100 nm is experimentally demonstrated by capturing the flowing fluorescent beads in microfluidic chip. Given the outstanding imaging performance with high-speed super-resolution, TCSRM provides a desired tool for the studies of high-speed dynamical behaviors in fine structures, especially in the biomedical field.",

Although electrically tunable superlattice (SL) potentials have been proposed for band structure engineering of the Dirac electrons in graphene, the ultimate goal of engineering emergent quasiparticle excitations that can hybridize with light has not been achieved. We show that an extreme modulation of one-dimensional (1D) SL potentials in monolayer graphene produces ladder-like electronic energy levels near the Fermi surface, resulting in optical conductivity dominated by intersubband transitions (ISBTs). A specific and experimentally realizable platform comprising hBN-encapsulated graphene on top of a 1D periodic metagate and a second unpatterned gate is shown to produce strongly modulated electrostatic potentials. We find that Dirac electrons with large momenta perpendicular to the modulation direction are waveguided via total internal reflections off the electrostatic potential, resulting in flat subbands with nearly equispaced energy levels. The predicted ultrastrong coupling of surface plasmons to electrically controlled ISBTs is responsible for emergent polaritonic quasiparticles that can be optically probed. Our study opens an avenue for exploring emergent polaritons in 2D materials with gate-tunable electronic band structures.",

While solid materials are naturally employed as key building elements for construction of optical metamaterials mainly due to their structural stability, practically no attention was given to study of liquid-made optical two-dimensional (2-D) metasurfaces and the underlying interaction regimes between surface optical modes and liquids. We theoretically demonstrate that surface plasmon polaritons and slab waveguide modes that propagate within a thin liquid dielectric film trigger optical self-induced interaction facilitated by surface tension effects, which leads to the formation of 2-D optical liquid-made lattices/metasurfaces with tunable symmetry and can be leveraged for tuning of lasing modes. Furthermore, we show that the symmetry breaking of the 2-D optical liquid lattice leads to phase transition and tuning of its topological properties, which allows the formation, destruction, and movement of Dirac-points in the k-space.

To massively increase the pulse energy of the femtosecond pulses, amplification is performed outside the oscillator. Recently, spatiotemporal mode-locking has been proposed as a new path to fiber lasers. However, the beam quality was highly multimode, and the calculated threshold pulse energy (>100 nJ) for nonlinear beam self-cleaning was challenging to realize. We present an approach to reach high energy per pulse directly in the mode-locked multimode fiber oscillator with a near single-mode output beam. Our approach relies on spatial beam self-cleaning via the nonlinear Kerr effect, and we demonstrate a multimode fiber oscillator with M2 < 1.13 beam profile, up to 24 nJ energy, and sub-100 fs compressed duration. Nonlinear beam self-cleaning is verified both numerically and experimentally for the first time in a mode-locked multimode laser cavity. The reported approach is further power scalable with larger core sized fibers up to a certain level of modal dispersion and could benefit applications that require high-power ultrashort lasers with commercially available optical fibers.",

To break the limitation of the existing techniques in imaging dimensions, we develop a spectral-volumetric compressed ultrafast photography (SV-CUP) technique. In our SV-CUP, the spatial resolutions in the x, y and z directions are, respectively, 0.39, 0.35, and 3 mm with an 8.8 mm × 6.3 mm field of view, the temporal frame interval is 2 ps, and the spectral frame interval is 1.72 nm. To demonstrate the excellent performance of our SV-CUP in spatial–temporal–spectral 5D imaging, we successfully measure the spectrally resolved photoluminescent dynamics of a 3D mannequin coated with CdSe quantum dots. Our SV-CUP brings unprecedented detection capabilities to dynamic scenes, which has important application prospects in fundamental research and applied science.",

While the recent emergence of droplet lasers has demonstrated their powerful capabilities in amplifying subtle molecular changes inside the cavity, the optical interactions between droplet resonators and an interface remain unclear. We revealed the underlying mechanism of droplet lasers when interacting with a droplet–solid interface and explored its correlation with intermolecular forces. A vertically oriented oscillation mode—arc-like mode—was discovered, where the number of lasing modes and their Q-factors increase with the strength of interfacial hydrophobicity. Both experimental and theoretical results demonstrated that hydrophobicity characterized by contact angle and interfacial tension plays a significant role in the geometry of droplet cavity and laser mode characteristics. Finally, we demonstrated how tiny forces induced by proteins and peptides could strongly modulate the lasing output in droplet resonators. Our findings illustrate the potential of exploiting optical resonators to amplify intermolecular force changes, providing comprehensive insights into lasing actions modulated by interfaces and applications in biophysics.",

However, a high degree of precision in the characterization of the noisy experimental apparatus is required to apply existing quantum-state engineering protocols. This is often lacking in practical scenarios, affecting the quality of the engineered states. We implement, experimentally, an automated adaptive optimization protocol to engineer photonic orbital angular momentum (OAM) states. The protocol, given a target output state, performs an online estimation of the quality of the currently produced states, relying on output measurement statistics, and determines how to tune the experimental parameters to optimize the state generation. To achieve this, the algorithm does not need to be imbued with a description of the generation apparatus itself. Rather, it operates in a fully black-box scenario, making the scheme applicable in a wide variety of circumstances. The handles controlled by the algorithm are the rotation angles of a series of waveplates and can be used to probabilistically generate arbitrary four-dimensional OAM states. We showcase our scheme on different target states both in classical and quantum regimes and prove its robustness to external perturbations on the control parameters. This approach represents a powerful tool for automated optimizations of noisy experimental tasks for quantum information protocols and technologies.",

In the continuous variable regime, the implementation of quantum state sharing needs the feedforward technique, which involves optic-electro and electro-optic conversions. These conversions limit the bandwidth of the quantum state sharing. Here, to avoid the optic-electro and electro-optic conversions, we experimentally demonstrate (2, 3) threshold deterministic all-optical quantum state sharing. A low-noise phase-insensitive amplifier based on the four-wave mixing process is utilized to replace the feedforward technique. We experimentally demonstrate that any two of three players can cooperate to implement the reconstruction of the secret state, while the rest of the players cannot get any information.

Recent studies have shown that several relativistic mechanisms, including inverse spin-Hall effect, inverse Rashba–Edelstein effect, and inverse spin-orbit-torque effect, can convert longitudinally injected spin-polarized currents from magnetic materials to transverse charge currents, thereby harnessing these currents for terahertz generation. However, these mechanisms typically require external magnetic fields and exhibit limitations in terms of spin-polarization rates and efficiencies of relativistic spin-to-charge conversion. We present a nonrelativistic and nonmagnetic mechanism that directly utilizes the photoexcited high-density charge currents across the interface. We demonstrate that the electrical anisotropy of conductive oxides RuO2 and IrO2 can effectively deflect injected charge currents to the transverse direction, resulting in efficient and broadband terahertz radiation. Importantly, this mechanism has the potential to offer much higher conversion efficiency compared to previous methods, as conductive materials with large electrical anisotropy are readily available, whereas further increasing the spin-Hall angle of heavy-metal materials would be challenging. Our findings offer exciting possibilities for directly utilizing these photoexcited high-density currents across metallic interfaces for ultrafast electronics and terahertz spectroscopy.",

We fully characterize 17 frequency-bin maximally entangled qubit pairs by performing quantum state tomography. We demonstrate for the first time, we believe, a fully connected five-user quantum network in the frequency domain. These results are a step towards a generation of quantum circuits implemented with scalable silicon photonics technology, for applications in quantum computing and secure communications.",

    "abstract": "Machine-learning techniques have gained popularity in nanophotonics research, being applied to predict optical properties, and inversely design structures. However, one limitation is the cost of acquiring training data, as complex structures require time-consuming simulations. To address this, researchers have explored using transfer learning, where pretrained networks can facilitate convergence with fewer data for related tasks, but application to more difficult tasks is still limited. In this work, a nested transfer learning approach is proposed, training models to predict structures of increasing complexity, with transfer between each model and few data used at each step. This allows modeling thin film stacks with higher optical complexity than previously reported. For the forward model, a bidirectional recurrent neural network is utilized, which excels in modeling sequential inputs. For the inverse model, a convolutional mixture density network is employed. In both cases, a relaxed choice of materials at each layer is introduced, making the approach more versatile. The final nested transfer models display high accuracy in retrieving complex arbitrary spectra and matching idealized spectra for specific application-focused cases, such as selective thermal emitters, while keeping data requirements modest. Our nested transfer learning approach represents a promising avenue for addressing data acquisition challenges.",

We perform a combined experimental and theoretical study to identify the relative contributions of the quantum orbits corresponding to the electrons tunneling ionized during the adjacent rising and falling quarter cycles of the electric field of the laser pulse. In our scheme, a perturbative second-harmonic field is added to the fundamental driving field. By analyzing the relative phase dependence of the signal in the photoelectron momentum distribution, the relative contributions of these two orbits are unambiguously determined. Our results show that their relative contributions sensitively depend on the longitudinal momentum and modulate with the transverse momentum of the photoelectron, which is attributed to the interference of the electron wave packets of the long orbit. The relative contributions of these orbits resolved here are important for the application of strong-field tunneling ionization as a photoelectron spectroscopy for attosecond time-resolved measurements.",

It provides an alternative way to overcome the diffraction limit, hence improving the resolution of an optical microscopy system. However, the optical superoscillatory waves are inevitably accompanied by strong side lobes, which limits their fields of view and, hence, potential applications. Here, we report both experimentally and theoretically a new superoscillatory wave form, which not only produces significant feature size down to deep subwavelength, but also completely eliminates side lobes in a particular dimension. We demonstrate a new mechanism for achieving such a wave form based on a pair of moonlike sharp-edge apertures. The resultant superoscillatory wave exhibits Bessel-like forms, hence allowing long-distance propagation of subwavelength structures. The result facilitates the study of optical superoscillation and on a fundamental level eliminates the compromise between the superoscillatory feature size and the field of view.",

Owing to these outstanding characteristics, the FW-BIC can serve as a robust and extraordinary cavity mode for realizing low-threshold laser operation and for achieving angle-steering laser beams. The conditions of the FW-BIC can be modulated by tuning the geometry related to the coupling modes in the anticrossing, resulting in a tunable lasing direction observed in the measurement. Furthermore, through appropriate design, the emission angle can be controlled precisely within a wide tunable range. Therefore, FW-BICs can be used to realize high-resolution directional lasing within a wide range of emission angles; they can also be applied in three-dimensional sensing for lidar applications.",

We propose and experimentally demonstrate a source-device-independent QRNG, which enables one to access true random bits with an untrusted source device. The random bits are generated by measuring the arrival time of either photon of the time–energy entangled photon pairs produced from spontaneous parametric downconversion, where the entanglement is testified through the observation of nonlocal dispersion cancellation. In experiment, we extract a generation rate of 4 Mbps by a modified entropic uncertainty relation, which can be improved to gigabits per second by using advanced single-photon detectors.

By employing judiciously chosen perturbations (wiggling of waveguides at desired frequencies), we show resonant mode coupling and tailored dynamics in SDs. Two distinct examples are illustrated: one features uniform synthetic mode coupling, and the other showcases the edge defects that allow for tailored light transport and confinement. Furthermore, we demonstrate morphing of light into a topologically protected edge mode with modified Su–Schrieffer–Heeger photonic lattices.

In this scenario, it is crucial to accurately model and control optical power evolutions (OPEs) through optical amplifiers (OAs), as they directly affect the signal-to-noise ratio and fiber nonlinearities. However, a fundamental contradiction arises between the complex physical phenomena in optical transmission and the required precision in network control. Traditional theoretical methods underperform due to ideal assumptions, while data-driven approaches entail exorbitant costs associated with acquiring massive amounts of data to achieve the desired level of accuracy. In this work, we propose a Bayesian inference framework (BIF) to construct the digital twin of OAs and control OPE in a data-efficient manner. Only the informative data are collected to balance the exploration and exploitation of the data space, thus enabling efficient autonomous-driving optical networks (ADONs). Simulations and experiments demonstrate that the BIF can reduce the data size for modeling erbium-doped fiber amplifiers by 80% and Raman amplifiers by 60%. Within 30 iterations, the optimal controlling performance can be achieved to realize target signal/gain profiles in links with different types of OAs. The results show that the BIF paves the way to accurately model and control OPE for future ADONs.",

Most recently, an analogue optical phase conjugation system was developed, equipped with stimulated emission light amplification that effectively achieves the least tradeoff ever, yielding high-gain and high-speed performance of optical focusing through dynamic thick media.",

    "abstract": "The collective response of macroscopic quantum states under perturbation is widely used to study quantum correlations and cooperative properties, such as defect-induced quantum vortices in Bose–Einstein condensates and the non-destructive scattering of impurities in superfluids. Superfluorescence (SF), as a collective effect rooted in dipole–dipole cooperation through virtual photon exchange, leads to the macroscopic dipole moment (MDM) in high-density dipole ensembles. However, the perturbation response of the MDM in SF systems remains unknown. Echo-like behavior is observed in a cooperative exciton ensemble under a controllable perturbation, corresponding to an initial collapse followed by a revival of the MDM. Such a dynamic response could refer to a phase transition between the macroscopic coherence regime and the incoherent classical state on a time scale of 10 ps. The echo-like behavior is absent above 100 K due to the instability of MDM in a strongly dephased exciton ensemble. Experimentally, the MDM response to perturbations is shown to be controlled by the amplitude and injection time of the perturbations.",

The vast majority of optical barcodes were designed to identify a specific target by fluorescence emission spectra, without being able to characterize dynamic changes in response to analytes through time. To overcome these limitations, the concept of the bioresponsive dynamic photonic barcode was proposed by exploiting interfacial energy transfer between a microdroplet cavity and binding molecules. Whispering-gallery modes resulting from cavity-enhanced energy transfer were therefore converted into photonic barcodes to identify binding activities, in which more than trillions of distinctive barcodes could be generated by a single droplet. Dynamic spectral barcoding was achieved by a significant improvement in terms of signal-to-noise ratio upon binding to target molecules. Theoretical studies and experiments were conducted to elucidate the effect of different cavity sizes and analyte concentrations. Time-resolved fluorescence lifetime was implemented to investigate the role of radiative and non-radiative energy transfer. Finally, microdroplet photonic barcodes were employed in biodetection to exhibit great potential in fulfilling biomedical applications.",

For nanosecond LIBS (ns-LIBS), the plasma shielding effect limits its reproducibility, repeatability, and signal-to-noise ratios. Although femtosecond laser filament induced breakdown spectroscopy (FIBS) has no plasma shielding effects, the power density clamping inside the filaments limits the measurement sensitivity. We propose and demonstrate plasma-grating-induced breakdown spectroscopy (GIBS). The technique relies on a plasma excitation source—a plasma grating generated by the interference of two noncollinear femtosecond filaments. We demonstrate that GIBS can overcome the limitations of standard techniques such as ns-LIBS and FIBS. Signal intensity enhancement with GIBS is observed to be greater than 3 times that of FIBS. The matrix effect is also significantly reduced with GIBS, by virtue of the high power and electron density of the plasma grating, demonstrating great potential for analyzing samples with complex matrix.",

As shown, external stimulation endows the stimuli-responsive photonic MOFs with intriguing regulatable photonic properties: intensive and tunable emission, multiphoton-excitable luminescence, nonlinear optical, circularly polarized luminescence, lasing, etc. Furthermore, their advanced representative applications, such as information encryption and anticounterfeiting display, biological imaging, chemosensing, and others, are also reviewed.

We show that the glide-symmetric TL presents merged pass bands and mode degeneracy, which lead to broad working bandwidth and extremely low coupling between neighboring TLs. Dual-conductor SSPP TLs with and without glide symmetry are arranged in parallel as two channels with very deep subwavelength separation (e.g., λ0 / 100 at 5 GHz) for the application of integrated circuits and systems. Mutual coupling between the hybrid channels is analyzed using coupled mode theory and characterized in terms of scattering parameters and near-field distributions. We demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that the hybrid TL array obtains significantly more suppressed crosstalk than the uniform array of two nonglide symmetric TLs. Hence, it is concluded that the glide symmetry can be adopted to flexibly design the propagation of SSPPs and benefit the development of highly compact plasmonic circuits.",

We experimentally demonstrate a broadband nonlinear thermal emission in the visible-NIR spectrum within a quadradic nonlinear medium, which emits visible thermal radiation through a pump-driven nonlinear upconversion from its mid-IR components even at room temperature, unlike its linear counterpart which requires ultrahigh temperature. The broadband emission is enabled by the crucial random quasi-phase-matching condition in our nonlinear nanocrystal powders. Moreover, nonlinear thermal emission also permits visible thermometry using traditional optical cameras instead of thermal ones. This scheme paves the way to understand thermal radiation dynamics with nonlinearity in many fields, such as nonlinear heat transfer and nonlinear thermodynamics.",

However, previous experimental studies on SBOs have only been limited to the weak ac-driving regime, and the collapse of SBOs has not been observed. Here, by harnessing a synthetic temporal lattice in fiber-loop systems, we push the ac-field into a strong-driving regime and observe the collapse of SBOs, which manifests as the oscillation-trajectory localization at specific ac-driving amplitudes and oscillation-direction flip by crossing collapse points. By adopting arbitrary-wave ac-driving fields, we also realize generalized SBOs with engineered collapse conditions. Finally, we exploit the oscillation-direction flip features to design tunable temporal beam routers and splitters. We initiate and demonstrate the collapse of SBOs, which may feature applications in coherent wave localization control for optical communications and signal processing.",

This limitation mainly arises from the spatial inhomogeneities of refractive index (RI) in biological tissues, where light propagation is severely hindered by scattering and absorption. In recent years, enhancing imaging outcomes by reducing the scattering effects in tissues has become a hot topic of research. One effective way is to increase the refractive index of the aqueous components with optical clearing agents, achieving an effective RI level closer to that of lipids and proteins. This article comments on a recent study that reported a counterintuitive yet plain approach to the barrier and achieved biocompatible transparency of live tissues. In brief, the proposed strategy enables harmless, reversible tissue clarification of living rodents, greatly increasing the penetration depth and resolution of current in-vivo imaging technologies.",

Although recent optical experiments have inferred the existence of vector fields with the topologies of merons, the inability to extract the full three-dimensional vectors misses a richer set of topologies that have not yet been fully explored. We extend the study of the topology of electromagnetic fields on surfaces to a spin quasi-particle with the topology of a meron pair, formed by interfering surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), and show that the in-plane vectors are constrained by the embedding topology of the space as dictated by the Poincaré–Hopf theorem. In addition, we explore the time evolution of the three-dimensional topology of the spin field formed by femtosecond laser pulses. These experiments are possible using our here-developed method called polarimetric photo-emission electron microscopy (polarimetric PEEM), which combines an optical pump–probe technique and polarimetry with PEEM. This method allows for the accurate generation of SPP fields and their subsequent measurement, revealing both the spatial distribution of the full three-dimensional electromagnetic fields at deep subwavelength resolution and their time evolution.",

However, a conventional way to excite the localized phonon resonance involves ion etching, which reduces the attainable quality factors (Q-factors) of the resonators. We show that by introducing a deep subwavelength layer of dielectric gratings on a phononic substrate, localized dipolar resonance and higher order modes with high Q-factors 96 and 195, respectively, can be excited. We further demonstrate, via experiments and simulations, that the resonant wavelength and field confinement can be controlled by coupling the localized hybrid mode with propagating surface phonon-polaritons. We also observed for the first time the coupling between a localized dipolar mode and a propagating higher-order surface phonon-polariton mode. The results will be useful in designing on-chip, low-loss, and highly integrated phononic devices in the infrared spectral domain.",

    "abstract": "Synchronization is of importance in both fundamental and applied physics, but its demonstration at the micro/nanoscale is mainly limited to low-frequency oscillations such as mechanical resonators. We report the synchronization of two coupled optical microresonators, in which the high-frequency resonances in the optical domain are aligned with reduced noise. It is found that two types of synchronization regimes emerge with either the first- or second-order transition, both presenting a process of spontaneous symmetry breaking. In the second-order regime, the synchronization happens with an invariant topological character number and a larger detuning than that of the first-order case. Furthermore, an unconventional hysteresis behavior is revealed for a time-dependent coupling strength, breaking the static limitation and the temporal reciprocity. The synchronization of optical microresonators offers great potential in reconfigurable simulations of many-body physics and scalable photonic devices on a chip.",

    "abstract": "In general relativity, a gravitational \"white hole\" is a hypothetical region of space that cannot be entered from outside. It is the reverse of a \"black hole\" from which light and information cannot escape. We report an optical device exhibiting intriguing similarities to these objects. It will either totally absorb (optical black hole) or totally reject (optical white hole) light of any wavelength, depending on its polarization. The device's functionality is based on the formation of a standing wave from the wavefront of spatially coherent incident radiation. Interaction of the standing wave with a thin absorber enables coherent perfect absorption and transmission, whereas polarization sensitivity arises from the geometrical phase of the interfering beams. We provide experimental proof-of-principle demonstrations and show that the device operates as a black and white hole for orthogonal polarizations of the incident light. From a remote point, it will look similar to a gravitational black or white hole depending on the polarization of light. In principle, the optical black and white hole device can operate as a deterministic absorber or rejector throughout the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Broadband absorbers and rejectors can be useful for energy harvesting, detection, stealth technologies, and redistribution of light.",

Although metasurface-based holograms can be ultra-compact, holographic images generated by previously realized metadevices were mostly scalar ones, with a few vectorial holograms realized so far suffering from restrictions on efficiency, incident polarization, and resolution. We propose and experimentally demonstrate an efficient meta-platform to generate vectorial holographic images with high resolutions under arbitrary incident polarizations. Combining Gerchberg–Saxton algorithm and the wave-decomposition technique, we establish a generic strategy to retrieve the optical properties (e.g., reflection phases and polarization-conversion capabilities) of meta-atoms required to construct a metasurface for generating a predesigned vectorial holographic image under a predesigned incident polarization. We next design a series of high-efficiency and deep-subwavelength single-structure meta-atoms exhibiting tailored reflection phases and polarization-conversion capabilities governed by both structural resonances and the Pancharatnam–Berry effect, and experimentally characterize their optical scattering properties. We finally construct a series of ultra-thin metadevices with these meta-atoms and experimentally demonstrate that they can generate pre-designed vectorial holographic images under illuminations of circularly polarized light at 1064 nm. We provide a highly efficient and ultra-thin platform to generate predesigned vectorial holographic images under illuminations of light with arbitrary given polarization, which can inspire numerous future applications in on-chip photonics.",

    "abstract": "Computational imaging (CI) leverages the joint optimization of optical system design and reconstruction algorithms, enabling superior performance in terms of dimensionality, resolution, efficiency, and hardware complexity. It has found widespread applications in medical diagnosis and astronomy, among others. Recently, deep learning (DL) has changed the paradigm of CI by harnessing learned priors from data through trained neural network models. However, widely used data-driven DL-based CI methods encounter difficulties related to training data acquisition, computation requirements, generalization, and interpretability. Recent studies have indicated that integrating the physics prior of the CI system into various components of DL pipelines (including training data, network design, and loss functions) holds promise for alleviating these challenges. To provide readers with a better understanding of the current research status and ideas, we present an overview of the state-of-the-art in DL-based CI. We begin by briefly introducing the concepts of CI and DL, followed by a comprehensive review of how DL addresses inverse problems in CI. Particularly, we focus on the emerging physics-enhanced approaches. We highlight the perspectives of future research directions and the transfer to real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "Quantum entanglement networks have garnered significant attention due to the inherent security provided by quantum physics. The networks aim to connect a multitude of users with a high secure key rate (SKR). Fully connected networks have been demonstrated using wavelength-division multiplexing architectures. However, the SKR of such networks remains challenging due to the limited brightness of quantum photon-pair sources and the loss introduced by cascaded filtering components. We present high-rate quantum entanglement networks that leverage a broadband quantum light source with high brightness and an industry-grade flexible wavelength-selective switching technique with uniform loss. By implementing the BBM92 protocol, we achieve an SKR of 28.19 kbps in a four-user network, representing a two-order-of-magnitude improvement over previous implementations. After transmission through a 40-km fiber spool, the SKR remains as high as 3.58 kbps and stays positive over distances up to 250 km. Furthermore, the flexibility of our scheme is illustrated by constructing a six-user network, achieving SKRs of 4.21 kbps and 0.45 kbps without and with a 40-km fiber spool, respectively. These results demonstrate a practical approach to enhancing the SKR and scalability in entanglement-based quantum networks, offering a feasible solution for deploying metropolitan and backbone quantum communication systems.",

We suggest several realizations of this concept for anisotropic metasurfaces and demonstrate experimentally how such CROW-inspired metasurfaces can be employed to achieve unidirectional and bidirectional linear polarization flatbands, as well as chiral flatbands that are highly selective to the circular polarization of the incoming light.",

    "abstract": "Dispersion engineering of optical waveguides is among the most important steps in enabling the realization of Kerr optical frequency combs. A recurring problem is the limited bandwidth in which the nonlinear phase matching condition is satisfied, due to the dispersion of the waveguide. This limitation is particularly stringent in high-index-contrast technologies such as silicon-on-insulator. We propose a general approach to stretch the bandwidth of Kerr frequency combs based on subwavelength engineering of single-mode waveguides with self-adaptive boundaries. The wideband flattened dispersion operation comes from the particular property of the waveguide optical mode that automatically self-adapts its spatial profile at different wavelengths to slightly different effective spatial spans determined by its effective index values. This flattened dispersion relies on the squeezing of small normal-dispersion regions between two anomalous spectral zones, which enables it to achieve two Cherenkov radiation points and substantially broaden the comb, achieving a bandwidth between 2.2 and 3.4 μm wavelength. This strategy opens up a design space for trimming the spectra of Kerr frequency combs using high-index-contrast platforms and can provide benefits to various nonlinear applications in which the manipulation of energy spacing and phase matching are pivotal.",

In photonics, Rabi oscillations can be mimicked by applying a weak longitudinal periodic modulation to the refractive index. However, the Rabi oscillations of nonlinear states have yet to be introduced. We report the Rabi oscillations of azimuthons—spatially modulated vortex solitons—in weakly nonlinear waveguides with different symmetries. The period of the Rabi oscillations can be determined by applying the coupled mode theory, which largely depends on the modulation strength. Whether the Rabi oscillations between two states can be obtained or not is determined by the spatial symmetry of the azimuthons and the modulating potential. Our results not only deepen the understanding of the Rabi oscillation phenomena, but also provide a new avenue in the study of pattern formation and spatial field manipulation in nonlinear optical systems.",

Thermoacoustic conversion efficiency is however very low, even with an exogenous contrast agent. We break this low-conversion limit, using a split ring resonator to effectively collect and confine the microwaves into a submillimeter hot spot for ultrasound emission and achieve a conversion efficiency over 2000 times higher than other reported thermoacoustic contrast agents. Importantly, the frequency of emitted ultrasound can be precisely tuned and multiplexed by modulation of the microwave pulses. Such performance is inaccessible by a piezoelectric-based transducer or a photoacoustic emitter and, therefore, split ring resonators open up new opportunities to study the frequency response of cells in ultrasonic biomodulation. For applications in deep tissue localization, a split ring resonator can be used as a wireless, battery-free ultrasound beacon placed under a breast phantom.",

Furthermore, it is experimentally verified that nonreciprocal systems with an ill-defined topology may be used to abruptly halt the energy flow in a unidirectional waveguide due to the violation of the bulk-edge correspondence. In particular, we report the formation of an energy sink that absorbs the incoming electromagnetic waves with a large field enhancement at the singularity.",

We examined the PEC mechanism and compound semiconductor etching rate in diluted sulfuric acid solution. Using this technique, we produced microlasers on a chip and isolated particles with distinct lasing wavelengths. These precisely tuned disk lasers were then used to tag cells in culture.

These states have been explored in various systems, including photonic and phononic crystal slabs, metasurfaces, waveguides, and integrated circuits. Robustness and availability of the BICs are important aspects for fully taming the BICs toward practical applications. Here, we propose a generic mechanism to realize BICs that exist by first principles free of fine parameter tuning based on non-Maxwellian double-net metamaterials (DNMs). An ideal warm hydrodynamic double plasma (HDP) fluid model provides a homogenized description of DNMs and explains the robustness of the BICs found herein. In the HDP model, these are standing wave formations made of electron acoustic waves (EAWs), which are pure charge oscillations with vanishing electromagnetic fields. EAW BICs have various advantages, such as (i) frequency-comb-like collection of BICs free from normal resonances; (ii) robustness to symmetry-breaking perturbations and formation of quasi-BICs with an ultrahigh Q-factor even if subject to disorder; and (iii) giving rise to subwavelength microcavity resonators hosting quasi-BIC modes with an ultrahigh Q-factor.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen significant advances in the study of dissipative soliton molecules in ultrafast lasers, driven by their remarkable connections to a wide range of physical systems. However, understanding and controlling the underlying physics of soliton molecules remain elusive due to the absence of a universal physical model that adequately describes intramolecular motion. We demonstrate that resonant excitation generates breather soliton molecules, with their resonance susceptibility exhibiting high amplitude-driven operations that can be well understood within the framework of the Duffing model. Harnessing powerful experiment techniques and detailed numerical simulations, we reveal the fundamental resonant mode within intrapulse separation constrained to the 100 fs level as well as the presence of the subharmonic and overtones. Additionally, we observe chaotic dynamics arising from the multiple-frequency nonlinear interactions in a strongly dissipative regime. Our work provides a perspective on the complex interactions of dissipative optical solitons through the lens of nonlinear physics. This approach offers a simple test bed for complex nonlinear physics research, with ultrafine scanning of temporal separations of ultrashort laser pulses demonstrating significant potential for applications requiring high detection sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Quantum-confined Stark effects (QCSEs), where external or built-in electric fields modify optical transition energies, have garnered significant interest due to their potential for tuning emission energies to couple with quantum dots, metasurfaces, cavities, etc. However, only external electric-field-enabled QCSEs in 2D semiconductors have been reported so far, owing to the challenges posed by small and uncontrollable built-in electric fields, as well as charge modulation effects. We report the first observation of giant built-in electric field-enabled QCSEs in 1L WSe2/1L graphene heterostructure (HS) with an air-gap structure that suppresses graphene screening and bandgap renormalization. Electrical control of QCSEs demonstrates a maximum Stark shift of ∼56.97 meV. This significant shift is attributed to enhanced built-in electric fields resulting from the doping-induced increase of chemical potential difference. While increasing optical doping or reducing the interlayer distance, QCSEs weaken due to reduced built-in electric fields. By leveraging efficient exciton dissociations from built-in electric fields, the responsivity (R) and response speed of HS photodetectors increase by 3 orders of magnitude and threefold, respectively, compared with 1L WSe2. Our results offer a new avenue for enhancing exciton tunability and exploring device applications of 2D materials in photodetectors, polariton transistors, and quantum light sources.",

First, scalar quantum mechanics of photons operating with the photon wave functions is discussed. Using the first quantization, the wave equation, the Schrödinger-like equations, and the Dirac equation for photons are derived. Then, vector quantum mechanics of photons is introduced, which defines the electromagnetic vector fields. Using the first quantization, the Maxwell equations for photons in a magneto-dielectric medium are obtained. Because the photon's electric and magnetic fields satisfy the Maxwell equations, all that is known about the classical optical fields can be directly transferred to photons demonstrating their quantum diversity. Relationships between the scalar and vector quantum mechanics of photons and between the Dirac and Maxwell equations are analyzed. To describe the propagation of photons in dispersive media, modified Maxwell equations are introduced.",

    "abstract": "Spin-orbital interaction characterizes the momentum coupling between polarization and spatial behaviors of electromagnetic waves. The corresponding transition phenomena have been recently manifested by geometric phase metasurfaces, which provide compact and intuitive platforms to replace traditional optical waveplate cascading systems. Nevertheless, metasurfaces based on geometric phase can only impose two opposite modes of orbital angular momentum (OAM) in conjugate spin channels. Although cross-talks among adjacent channels can be exhaustedly minimized, the purity and efficiency of spin-orbital transitions would still be impacted by the coexisting conjugate coupling. Here, we exploit a metasurface with non-orthogonal eigen formalism to achieve the channel-locked spin-orbital transitions, where the output spin state can be constantly fixed while at the same time imposed with versatile modes of OAM with high purity and efficiency. Besides, the robustness of the channel-locked spin-orbital transition is also demonstrated under full polarization illuminations. Such results provide a scheme for full-Stokes beam generation and high-performance meta-polarizer design, which shows the potential of reconfigurable polarization control in wireless communication systems.",

We present a coupled-quasinormal-mode framework for analyzing dissipative coupling with photonic and plasmonic resonators. The framework provides rigorous closed-form expressions for dissipative coupling coefficients and introduces novel features, such as a coupling scheme via time derivatives of excitation coefficients. It delivers transparent and accurate predictions of exotic phenomena—such as zero-coupling between very close cavities and level-attraction effects—that are only vaguely captured by traditional CMT models. Efficient and user-friendly, this framework facilitates rapid parameter space exploration for device design and offers potential for extension to nonlinear and quantum systems in future applications.",

However, stable, rationally designed, and uniform microbubbles on substrates such as silicon chips are challenging because of the random nature of microbubble formation. We describe the fabrication of elastic microbubbles with a precise control of volume and curvature based on femtosecond laser irradiated graphene oxide. We demonstrate that the graphene microbubbles possess a near-perfect curvature that allows them to function as reflective microlenses for focusing broadband white light into an ultrahigh aspect ratio diffraction-limited photonic jet without chromatic aberration. Our results provide a pathway for integration of graphene microbubbles as lenses for nanophotonic components for miniaturized lab-on-a-chip devices along with applications in high-resolution spectroscopy and imaging.",

Third-order auto-correlator or cross-correlator have been widely used to characterize the temporal contrast of an ultra-intense laser pulse in the past decades. Here, a novel and simple single-shot fourth-order auto-correlator to characterize the temporal contrast with higher time resolution and better pulse contrast fidelity in comparison to third-order correlators is proposed. The single-shot fourth-order autocorrelation consists of a frequency degenerate four-wave mixing process and a sum-frequency mixing process. The proof-of-principle experiments show that a dynamic range of approximately 10^11 compared with the noise level, a time resolution of approximately 160 fs, and a time window of 65 ps can be successfully obtained using the novel single-shot fourth-order auto-correlator, which is the highest dynamic range with simultaneous high time resolution for single-shot temporal contrast measurement so far. Furthermore, the temporal contrast of laser pulse from a PW laser system is successfully measured in single-shot with a dynamic range of about 2*10^10 and simultaneous a time resolution of 160 fs.",

We also present simulation results and experimental validation for a new open-loop control strategy enabling simultaneous control of both DPPs, which ensures optimum correction for both large-amplitude low-order, and complex combinations of low- and high-order aberrations. The resulting system can reproduce Zernike modes up to the sixth radial order with stroke and fidelity up to twice better than what is attainable with either of the DPPs individually.

    "abstract": "Optical vector analysis (OVA) is an enabling technology for comprehensively characterizing both amplitude and phase responses of optical devices or systems. Conventional OVA technologies are mostly based on discrete optoelectronic components, leading to unsatisfactory system sizes, complexity, and stability. They also encounter challenges in revealing the on-chip characteristics of integrated photonic devices, which are often overwhelmed by the substantial coupling loss and extra spectral response at chip facets. In this work, we demonstrate a miniaturized OVA system based on broadband single-sideband (SSB) modulators on a thin-film lithium niobate (LN) platform. The OVA could provide a direct probe of both amplitude and phase responses of photonic devices with kilohertz-level resolution and tens of terahertz of measurement bandwidth. We perform in situ characterizations of single and coupled microring resonators fabricated on the same chip as the OVA, unfolding their intrinsic loss and coupling states unambiguously. Furthermore, we achieve the direct measurement of collective phase dynamics and density of states of the Bloch modes in a synthetic frequency crystal by in situ OVA of a dynamically modulated microring resonator. Our OVA system provides a compact, high-precision, and broadband solution for characterizing future integrated photonic devices and circuits, with potential applications ranging from optical communications, biosensing, and neuromorphic computing, to quantum information processing.",

We use 1650-nm femtosecond laser pulses to induce the plasma in a stable free-flowing water film under the strong field ionization mechanism. Moreover, we adopt intense terahertz (THz) pulses to probe the ultrafast temporal evolution of quasifree electrons of the laser-induced plasma in water on the subpicosecond scale. For the first time, the THz wave absorption signal with a unique two-step decay characteristic in time domain is demonstrated, indicating the significance of electron solvation in water. We employ the Drude model combined with the multilevel intermediate model and particle-in-a-box model to simulate and analyze the key information of quasifree electrons, such as the frequency-domain absorption characteristics and solvation ratio. In particular, we observe that the solvation capacity of liquid water decreases with the increase of pumping energy. Up to ∼50 % of quasifree electrons cannot be captured by traps associated with the bound states as the pumping energy increases to 90 μJ / pulse. The ultrafast electron evolution in liquid water revealed by the optical-pump/THz-probe experiment provides further insights into the formation and evolution mechanisms of liquid plasma.",

Here, we introduce dual-modulation difference STED microscopy (dmdSTED) to suppress the background noise in traditional STED imaging. By applying respective time-domain modulations to the two continuous-wave lasers, signals are distributed discretely in the frequency spectrum and thus are obtained through lock-in demodulation of the corresponding frequencies. The background signals can be selectively eliminated from the effective signal without compromise of temporal resolution. We used nanoparticle, fixed cell, and perovskite coating experiments, as well as theoretical demonstration, to confirm the effectiveness of this method. We highlight dmdSTED as an idea and approach with simple implementation for improving the imaging quality, which substantially enlarges the versatility of STED nanoscopy.",

Coherent interconnects for converting photons between different wavelengths are highly desired. Although coherent interconnects have conventionally been realized with nonlinear optical effects, those systems require demanding experimental conditions, such as phase matching and/or cavity enhancement, which not only bring difficulties in experimental implementation but also set a narrow tuning bandwidth (typically in the MHz to GHz range as determined by the cavity linewidth). Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate coherent information transfer between two orthogonally propagating light beams of disparate wavelengths in a fiber-based optomechanical system, which does not require phase matching or cavity enhancement of the pump beam. The coherent process is demonstrated by interference phenomena similar to optomechanically induced transparency and absorption. Our scheme not only significantly simplifies the experimental implementation of coherent wavelength conversion but also extends the tuning bandwidth to that of an optical fiber (tens of THz), which will enable a broad range of coherent-optics-based applications, such as optical sensing, spectroscopy, and communication.",

Insight into the yet unknown nanoscopic optical properties of these nanostructures is highly desired for their future applications in nanophotonics. We implement a spectrally broadband scattering-type near-field optical spectroscopy technique to study individual Sb2S3 nanodots with a 20-nm spatial resolution, covering the range from 700 to 900 nm. We show that in this below-bandgap range, the Sb2S3 nanostructures act as high-refractive-index, low-loss waveguides with mode profiles close to those of idealized cylindrical waveguides, despite a considerable structural disorder. In combination with their high above-bandgap absorption, this makes them promising candidates for applications as dielectric metamaterials, specifically for ultrafast photoswitching.",

Here, we report the first observation of the laser-beam interaction in a pure dipole magnet, in which the electron beam energy modulation with 40-keV amplitude and 266-nm period is measured. We demonstrate that such an energy modulation can be used to launch a seeded FEL, that is, lasing at the sixth harmonic of the seed laser in a high-gain harmonic generation scheme. The results reveal the most basic process of the FEL lasing and open up a new direction for the study and exploitation of laser-beam interactions.",

    "abstract": "Several setups for standoff sensing using vibrational spectroscopy were designed. Two modes of detection were used active and passive mode. In the active mode a quantum cascade laser (QCL) and conventional sources (Globar) were used. In active mode the intensity is extremely dependent on the alignment between the source, the target and the detector. We considered the effect of having the source out of alignment at small to relatively large angular deviations from back reflection (normal incidence or 0°). Several substrates and complex matrices were studied using QCL in order to detect highly energetic material (HEM) and biological agent simulants (BAS). HEM used were RDX, PETN, TNT, TATP and AN; BAS were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermis and Bacillus thuringiensis. The substrates used were glass, cardboard, travel bags, wood, aluminum and stainless steel. HEMs were mixed in various matrices such as sand, clay, synthetic soils and actual soil. Multivariate statistical routines such as principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares analysis (PLS), discriminant analysis (DA) and hyphenated routines (PLS-DA) were applied to recorded spectra. The results show that vibrational techniques investigated are useful for classification, detection and quantification of theses microorganisms and HEM in the types of substrates and matrices studied.",

    "abstract": "The quantum properties of quantum measurements are indispensable resources in quantum information processing and have drawn extensive research interest. The conventional approach to reveal the quantum properties relies on the reconstruction of the entire measurement operators by quantum detector tomography. However, many specific properties can be determined by a part of matrix entries of the measurement operators, which provides us the possibility to simplify the process of property characterization. Here, we propose a general framework to directly obtain individual matrix entries of the measurement operators by sequentially measuring two non-compatible observables. This method allows us to circumvent the complete tomography of the quantum measurement and extract the useful information for our purpose. We experimentally implement this scheme to monitor the coherent evolution of a general quantum measurement by determining the off-diagonal matrix entries. The investigation of the measurement precision indicates the good feasibility of our protocol to the arbitrary quantum measurements. Our results pave the way for revealing the quantum properties of quantum measurements by selectively determining the matrix entries of the measurement operators.",

Scattered waves contain intrinsic signatures of motion, which manifest in a broad range of phenomena, including Sagnac interference, and both Doppler and micro-Doppler frequency shifts. Although general relativity is often required to account for motion, instantaneous rest frame approaches are frequently used to describe interactions with slowly accelerating objects. We investigate theoretically and experimentally an interaction regime that is neither relativistic nor adiabatic. The test model considers an accelerating scatterer with a long-lasting relaxation memory. The slow decay rates violate the instantaneous reaction assumption of quasistationarity, introducing non-Markovian contributions to the scattering process. Memory signatures in scattering from a rotating dipole are studied theoretically, showing symmetry breaking of micro-Doppler combs. A quasistationary numeric analysis of scattering in the short-memory limit is proposed and validated experimentally with an example of electromagnetic pulses interacting with a rotating wire.",

For some of these methods, the metals are deposited via sputtering, and selenium is supplied from a secondary source either during or after deposition. In other CIGS sputtering techniques, selenium is included directly in the sputtering targets, eliminating the need for post-deposition selenization and the reliance on toxic H2Se gas. In general, sputtering offers several advantages over other deposition methods including excellent uniformity over large areas and high material usage. Interestingly, while record efficiencies for laboratory CIGS cells have been established using co-evaporation, the recent records for CIGS modules are based on CIGS films that have been deposited via multicomponent sputtering. We discuss recent progress on sputtered CIGS, reviewing various sputter deposition methods and discussing the advantages and limitations of each. Finally, we highlight areas of research that may result in improved performance.",

Discovered in 2007 [1], one main goal has been to achieve a frequency comb that is coherent and spans a spectrum wide enough to be self-referenced. Many important steps in this direction have been achieved [2,3]. However, the goal of a fully coherent yet wide enough spectrum for self-referencing has not been achieved. Here we report on a frequency comb generated in a silicon nitride (SiN) microresonator that has a repetition rate of 190 GHz and spans 2/3 of an octave, sufficient for self-referencing [4].",

So far, the form birefringence induced by these modifications was known mainly in fused silica. We determined the repetition rate of the irradiating laser pulses as crucial processing parameter. The retardation in the laser modified doped silica or GeO2 is comparable to fused silica, while the birefringence in Borosilicate is two times weaker.",

First we used the master curves derived from elementary (no tilt, no chirp) FBG written in different conditions. Then we did the ageing of the refractive index profile (both in the core and in the photosensitive cladding). Finally we recalculated the spectral response of GFF after ageing and we compared it to experimental measurements. In addition we validated our prediction by building a new master curve using passivated components. A less general spectral prediction approach based on passivated GFF is also presented. This last method is more representative of the final products.",

We show that the amplitude of these pulses can be reduced below a safety threshold by perturbing the system with a weak sinusoidal modulation of the bias current or with a moderate amount of incoherent light acting as a source of noise. The probability of observing rogue intensity pulses is also investigated when both a current modulation and noise act simultaneously. We show that their combined effects can significantly modify the likelihood of occurrence of a rogue wave. The results are compared with the unperturbed dynamics showing a resonant-like behavior near the characteristic time scales of the underlying dynamics.",

The applicability of these sensors is however strongly hampered by the large background that originates from both bulk refractive index changes and non-specific binding of molecules to the sensor surface. In this contribution we demonstrate a new method that allows us to separate the bulk background from the analyte signal. We show theoretical analysis and preliminary proof-of-principle experimental data, where binding of protein A is discriminated from a bulk refractive index change induced by D-Glucose, using multiple wavelengths. We anticipate that this method will increase the general applicability of IOYI sensors.",

With the optimum values, the single longitudinal mode laser is designed. For a cavity length of 200-m, a SMSR (side mode suppression ratio) of 41.65dB and 3dB bandwidth of 17GHz are obtained under 5mA driving current. Moreover, to get a SMSR over 38dB, the inhomogeneous broadening should be lower than 17meV. This work can provide a quantitative reference basis for the single mode quantum dot laser design.",

A near infrared tunable laser illuminates a sample from multiple directions. The image of the sample is recombined with a reference beam on a photodetector array. As the laser frequency is linearly tuned during a scan, a sequence of speckle interferograms is recorded. In order to reconstruct the sample structure, Fourier transformation is performed on a pixel by pixel basis along the temporal axis of the 3-D data cube obtained. Multiple displacement sensitivities are achieved by introducing different optical delays between the reference and the illumination beams, which separate the reconstruction signals in the frequency domain. Phase changes due to mechanical loading of the sample can finally be measured and combined to obtain all orthogonal components of the displacement field in a convenient coordinate system. Controlled rigid body rotations of an epoxy phantom have been used to validate the methodology.",

Continuous wave (CW), room temperature (RT) power of more than 4 W is now available from QCLs at 4.6 µm with a wall plug efficiency exceeding 16%. Similar high power, high wall plug efficiency improvement in performance has been demonstrated at all wavelengths from ~3.5 µm to ~12 µm. These semiconductor devices, when inserted into an wavelength dispersive optical cavity, produce single frequency tunable radiation that can cover most of the MWIR and LWIR spectral regions, which are rich in spectral absorption features of most of the industrial toxic gases, chemical warfare agents and explosives vapors. These tunable QCLs have now become the engines for a variety of sensors of the harmful gases. Substantial progress has been made both in the area of in-situ sensors and standoff detectors for the gases.I will describe the advances in QCL technology and applications of QCLs to a broad range of defense, homeland security and commercial applications.",

Here, we report the observation of a strong acousto-optic modulation of two-photon excited fluorescence. Harnessing this effect yields enhanced image detail and contrast and improves optical sectioning in deep brain tissue in vivo. Ultrasound-modulation assisted multiphoton imaging (UMAMI) is compatible with standard multiphoton microscopes, without requiring changes to the optical path or image acquisition parameters.",

It was established that the fluorescence of quantum dots is selectively responsive to heavy metal ions such as zinc, cadmium and copper. Sensitivity of luminescent-kinetic parameters of the probes from xanthene and acridine series to the presence of heavy metal ions as well as to structural changes in proteins was revealed. Sensors based on electronic excitation energy transfer between proteins and probes as well as between the probes associated by noncovalent bonds with proteins for determination of the structural changes in proteins were developed.",

The device employs a recently developed and accessible imaging approach, Convex Lens- Induced Confinement (CLIC), delivering key advantages based on its tunable nanoscale imaging geometry: sensitive detection and enhanced background suppression; minimal required analyte volume (~μL); direct visualization of molecular interactions and dynamics over extended time periods (seconds to minutes); and direct manipulation of molecular conformations [1]. The presented CLIC device loads the sample into a flow-cell using a microfluidics system and mechanically deforms the flow-cell, creating a tunable, nanoscale imaging chamber. A powerful feature of CLIC imaging is the ability to manipulate and visualize single molecules under a continuum of applied confinement, from the micrometer to nanometer scale. It overcomes a key challenge faced by existing nanofluidic technologies of delivering molecules from a microscale loading environment into a nanoscale imaging environment. We demonstrate the device's ability to manipulate the conformations of DNA molecules in free-solution, providing a new approach to partitioning and probing their physical properties. Further, combining CLIC imaging with surface-lithography presents a powerful approach to controllably manipulating and trapping molecules over a wide range of imaging conditions.",

However, the practical implementation of THz science in the civil theatre is restricted due to the lack not only of convenient high power THz wave emitters and sensitive detectors but also of efficient quasi-optical active devices such as amplifiers. In this work, we demonstrated the direct amplification of THz waves using Magnesium doped Lithium Niobate (MgO: LiNbO3) crystals as the non-linear gain medium. The input THz wave was injected as a seed beam along with the pump beam into the non-linear crystal and it was amplified by the optical parametric process. We report gain in excess of 50dB with an input THz pulse energy of less than 20 aJ. We believe that this demonstration will contribute to the convenience and further applicability of THz sensing techniques.",

    "abstract": "An optical impedance spectroscopy (OIS) technique based on a single-mode electro-active integrated optical waveguide (EA-IOW) was developed to investigate electron-transfer processes of redox adsorbates. A highly sensitive single-mode EA-IOW device was created to optically follow the time-dependent faradaic current originated from a sub-monolayer of cytochrome c protein species undergoing redox exchanges driven by a harmonic modulation of the electric potential at several DC bias potentials and at several frequencies. To properly retrieve the faradaic current density from the AC-modulated optical signal we introduce a mathematical formalism that i) accounts for intrinsic changes that invariably occur in the optical baseline of the EA-IOW device during potential modulation and ii) provides accurate results for the electrochemical parameters. We experimentally demonstrate the optical reconstruction of the faradaic current density, identify the formal potential and energy-width of the electron-transfer process, and determine the reaction rate constant of the charge-transfer process. Our experimental approach brings additional sensitivity, accuracy, and simplicity to electrochemical analysis, and is expected to become a useful tool in investigations of currently challenging redox processes.",

By providing a good understanding of the mechanisms triggering and controlling the rogue waves, we can compare the extreme intensity pulses generated in a semiconductor laser with cw optical injection and with an external optical feedback in the short cavity regime. Despite the different mechanisms behind the generation of extreme intensity pulses we show that both systems have similar behaviors.",

I then present recent nonlinear experiments performed in photonic crystal waveguides that demonstrate the strong reinforcement of nonlinear third-order optical phenomena with slow light with applications to optical switching, quantum light sources and broadband frequency conversion.",

Recently, by taking advantage of the field enhancement effect in high quality (Q) factor cavities, comb generations using continuous wave (CW) laser have been demonstrated in various materials, such as silica toroids, doped silica glass ring resonators, silicon nitride micro-ring resonators, diamond micro-ring resonators, crystalline CaF2 and MgF2 micro-toroids and etc. Aluminum nitride (AlN) possesses strong Kerr nonlinearity which can be used to generate optical frequency comb by cascaded four wave mixing [1. Also it has strong Pockels effect which allows electro-optic modulation [2. Here, we take advantage of both effects and demonstrate comb generation using on-chip aluminum nitride microring, high speed switching of the optical frequency comb,[3 and cascaded frequency conversions among the comb lines.

    "abstract": "A miniature stationary time-scanning Fourier Transform (FT) spectrometer was realized using a fiber-coupled LiNbO3 (LN) waveguide Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) with push-pull electrodes. The spectrometer operates in the near infrared (NIR) region in which the MZI is a monomode device and allows to use a nonlinear voltage ramp to modulate the optical pathlength difference (OPD). The monotonous wavelength dependence of the half-wave voltage for the MZI used was measured using multiple DFB lasers of different wavelengths. The spectrometer utilizes the measured dispersion of half-wave voltage to convert the intermediate spectrum retrieved from the intensity-vs-voltage interferogram into the power spectrum of the input light source. In the previous work the spectrometer has been demonstrated to be able to accurately determine the laser wavelength. In this work, the spectrometer with a halogen-tungsten lamp source was used to implement the NIR absorption measurements of liquid and solid samples. Figure 1 shows the experimental results obtained with the miniature stationary FT spectrometer. Despite the lower spectral resolution of the present FT spectrometer, the peak position at 1451.5nm in the absorption spectrum exactly corresponds to the maximum absorption of water indicated in the literature.1",

In this presentation, we will review the progress in the field of LSPR-based RI sensor. Then LSPR-based RI sensing properties of double-layered gold gratings separated by dielectric gratings were studied. Two-dimensional double-layered gold gratings, named as gold mushroom arrays, show a superior advantage as a LSPR-based RI sensor because their figure of merits can reach 108 as high as the theoretical predicted upper limit for the propagating surface plasmon resonance (PSPR)-based RI sensor. However, such a high FOM is obtained under a detection light with an oblique incident angle which is still not a favorable testing scheme, because it increases the complexity of the system. Therefore, we also proposed another RI sensor based on one-dimensional double layer gold gratings working under normal incidence, which gives a high FOM as well.",

Multiplex coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (MCARS) has been shown to generate a complete Raman spectrum from the material of interest using a single ultrabroadband pulse to coherently drive multiple molecular vibrations simultaneously. When used in conjunction with a narrow probe pulse, a complete Raman spectrum is created that can be detected in milliseconds. We will report on the MCARS spectra obtained from materials of interest at a distance of 1 m from the sample location. We will also be reporting on an analytical method to remove the nonresonant background that utilizes a combination of the maximum entropy method to reproduce the spectrum as well as complex spectral filtering to remove the nonresonant background and accurately determine the CARS spectrum interest without prior knowledge of the material of interest.",

The cavity enhanced light matter coupling allows creating a very efficient interface between the quantum dot and the optical far field. We deterministically position a single quantum dot in a connected pillar microcavity combined with a p-i-n junction and fabricate tunable ultrabright single photon sources. The collection efficiency is shown to exceed 60% and the indistinguishability of photons successively emitted by one device is in the 80-97% range depending on the excitation conditions. The quantum interference of photons emitted by two remote devices is shown to be greatly enhanced by the acceleration of spontaneous emission. Finally, we explore the possibility to store the quantum information on a longer time scale using the spin states of a hole in a quantum dot. We demonstrate the non-destructive measurement of a single spin by monitoring the spin dependent rotation of polarization of a probe beam: a polarization rotation of ±6° is observed depending on the spin state.",

Nonfluorescent analytes diffusing into the aperture displace the fluorescent molecules in the solution, leading to a decrease of the detected fluorescence signal, while analytes diffusing out of the aperture return the fluorescence level.

This mechanism, valid also in presence of high order nonlinear effect such as Raman and self-steepening governs the dynamics of N-soliton decomposition into individual frequency shifted solitons and dispersive waves and the resulting supercontinuum generation. Possibility to control the temporal compression/power enhancement of fission generated fundamental solitons will be discussed. Solitonic cavities created by several individual fundamental quasi-solitons and trapped dispersive waves in between will be demonstrated as a phenomenon occurring just after the N-soliton fission with corresponding projection of these light structure to an overall supercontinuum spectrum.",

Both extinction ratio and bit error rate degradation are measured.The proposed investigation allows the introduction of design rules, based on the minimum distance between components to ultimately avoid unwanted thermal effects.According to the result provided by our analysis, we also show how the ER degradation can be recovered.",

With coherent light, a speckle pattern is produced at the detector plane which is modulated when ultrasound is applied. This can be used to extract light which has passed through the ultrasound column. Pulsed ultrasound can be used to allow time gated detection of the ultrasound modulated signal along the ultrasound column. The process of demodulating the speckle pattern using parallel speckle and digital holography is described. This demodulation is also applicable to detection of non-linear ultrasound modulated signal through a pulse inversion technique. Although more challenging in terms of signal detection, extending the ultrasound modulation approach to fluorescence and bioluminescence sensing is also discussed.",

    "abstract": "The temperature dependence of GaInP/GaAs/Ge multi-junction solar cells are numerically modeled. The temperature dependence of the solar cell dark current and the spectral sensitivity of the solar cell are demonstrated. Both aspects of the temperature dependence are connected to the temperature dependence of the semiconductor band gaps. Reduction in the efficiency is simulated by shifting the semiconductor band gaps using the Varshni relation, which in the model creates the corresponding increase in solar cell dark current with increasing temperature. The Varshni relations is further utilized to develop a temperature dependent absorption coefficient model. This model simulates the shift in the external quantum efficiency to longer wavelengths as the temperature increases, which shows good agreement with experimental results. Since standard test conditions of solar cells is at 298 K, this complex numerical model represents an important step forward to studying temperature dependences of multi-junction solar cells under real-world conditions, in which solar cell can operate at temperatures of 50 K above ambient temperatures.",

At the wavelength of 1 μm a standard fiber stretcher exhibiting normal second-order dispersion β2 can be used in combination with a grating compressor. But for ultrashort pulses with broad spectra, this scheme is disadvantageous due to the cumulative positive third-order dispersion (TOD) β3 of the stretcher and the compressor. As a consequence, the advantages of the fiber stretcher as a waveguide device are accompanied by longer minimum pulse durations compared to the use of a grating stretcher, unless the TOD is addressed by a more complicated compressor setup with gratings and prisms.",

We demonstrate the exceptional performance of the fiber for various fiber lengths, layouts, and operating wavelengths.

However, such magnetometers typically either require cryogenic systems to operate, or suffer poor dynamic range, limiting their ability to operate in ambient conditions. Here, we introduce the concept of a cavity optomechanical magnetometry[2], and demonstrate microscale room temperature magnetometry operating in the picoTelsa sensitivity range (see Fig. 1a). The peak sensitivity of 200 pT Hz−1/2 exceeds all previous microscale room temperature magnetometers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an inherent paramagnetic nonlinearity allows mix-up of low frequency to the RF frequency band, enabling magnetic field sensing in the Hz-kHz frequency window crucial for applications such as medical imaging, geosurvey, and magnetic anomaly detection (see Fig. 1b). This presents an enabling step towards real applications of cavity optomechanical magnetometers in high-performance microscale magnetometry.",

    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) pulses can carry transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM) that is perpendicular to the direction of pulse propagation.For a STOV pulse, the spatiotemporal profile can be significantly distorted due to unbalanced dispersive and diffractive phases.This may limit its use in many research applications where a long interaction length and a tight confinement of the pulse is needed.The stable and robust transmission of transverse photonic OAM through optical fiber may open new opportunities for transverse photonic OAM studies in telecommunications, novel OAM lasers, and nonlinear fiber-optical research.The image on the cover of Advanced Photonics Volume 5 Issue 3 illustrates the propagation of a spatiotemporal optical vortex wavepacket through an optical fiber, based on original research presented in the article by Qian Cao, Zhuo Chen, Chong Zhang, Andy Chong, and Qiwen Zhan in their article \"Propagation of transverse photonic orbital angular momentum through few-mode fiber\" (doi 10.1117/1.AP.5.3.036002).This article presents the first demonstration of STOV pulse propagation through a few-mode optical fiber.The authors note that the wavepacket maintains its spatiotemporal phase structure well, demonstrating the new possibility of transmitting transverse OAM inside fiber.",
