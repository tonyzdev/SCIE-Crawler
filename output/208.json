    "abstract": "Free radicals are known to be involved in lipid peroxidation as well as DNA and sperm membrane damages that may lead to decreased sperm motility or cell death. The balance between free radical production and their detoxification may be an important factor in sperm survival and function before, during and after cryopreservation. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of the addition of the antioxidants of oxidized glutathione (GSSG), bovine serum albumin (BSA), cysteine and lycopene to freezing media on the post-thawing sperm characteristics, including motility, morphology, acrosome integrity, viability and membrane integrity. A total number of 42 ejaculates were collected using the artifi cial vagina from 4 Akkaraman rams and 10 replicates of the ejaculates were diluted with a Tris-based extender containing additives and no additives as control. GSSG (5 mM), BSA (20 mg/ml), cysteine (10 mM) and lycopene (800 μg) showed more positive effects than other concentrations of the supplements and controls in protecting sperm characteristics after the freezing-thawing process ( P &lt; 0.001). Many aspects of sperm protection, e.g. sperm motility, viability and membrane stabilisation of the sperm cells during relative cryopreservation, are the key factors in determining the preservation of sperm function. The results of this study provide a new approach to the cryopreservation of sperm from rams and related breeds, and thereby contribute to the improvement of these breeds for the world sheep industry.",

A total of 4,050 eggs were examined. Egg quality characteristics were affected by genotype and age. Egg weight, yolk weight and percentage, Haugh Units increased with the hens’ age in all genotypes, but albumen and eggshell percentage decreased, eggshell thickness and strength improved with age. The highest egg weight (65.3 g) and yolk quality (yolk index 45.1%) were found in Moravia BSL at the end of the experiment. In contrast, the best albumen quality (albumen percentage 60.0) values were in Hisex Brown and the eggshell quality measurements (eggshell thickness 0.38 mm) were higher in ISA Brown.",

Alloxan was injected at a single dose of 60 mg/kg (into the tail vein) for diabetes induction. Quercetin (50 and 100 mg/kg; orally) and chrysin (50 and 100 mg/kg; orally) were administered daily for 3 days prior and 7 days after alloxan injection. Alloxan induced a significant increase of glycaemia ( p &lt; 0.001) in comparison with control animals. Quercetin at both doses prevented serum glucose elevation ( p &lt; 0.001). However, the protective effect of chrysin was weaker and surprisingly, most prominent at the lower dose ( p &lt; 0.05; p &lt; 0.01). On the other hand, glycosuria was increased in all groups of animals receiving alloxan. We suggest that the protective effect of the used flavonoids in experimental diabetes mellitus may be related to their antioxidative/chelatory properties. Increased glycosuria indicated that inhibition of renal glucose reabsorption may also play a role in the hypoglycaemic effect of both flavonoids.",

Acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric and valeric acids were determined. No significant differences (n = 53, P ≥ 0.05) have been identified in the amounts of acetic and propionic acids and the results are highly consistent. For butyric acid, the method of gas chromatography yielded higher results with a constant error of approximately 0.5 mmol/l in the whole range of concentration. In terms of diagnostics, however, this size of error is non-significant. In the case of valeric acid a proportional error was found. Gas chromatography yielded higher values, the difference being greater for the low values while for the higher values the results are almost identical. However, valeric acid is a minor acid and its determination is of secondary significance to rumen fermentation assessment. The gas chromatography method is able to clearly differentiate between n and iso forms in the case of butyric and valeric acids. It can be stated that the two analytical methods yield comparable results and both can be used for the needs of practical diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "Cooking can positively affect meat tenderness, on the other hand, the heat treatment also causes weight loss. The resulting tenderness of cooked meat is influenced by the background toughness of fresh meat, by the post mortem ageing process and by the method of cooking. In the case of heat treatment, the temperature and duration of action play a key role. In this respect, the meat tenderness depends on the type of appliance used for cooking. The cooking loss of meat during heat treatment is caused by contraction of muscle fibres and intramuscular connective tissue, the intensity of which also depends on the temperature and device used. The extent of this contraction increases with increasing temperature. Cooking of meat is considered the most effective way of eliminating microorganisms causing food-borne diseases. The recommended combination of temperature and time of 70 °C for 2 min reduces the number of Listeria monocytogenes bacteria by more than 6 log. This temperature is not, however, always attained with the use of many meat cooking methods, such as grilling or frying. This presents the risk of survival of food-borne agents. The latest knowledge indicates that, in the case of cross contamination, the population of food-borne agents is of the order of 1–2 log CFU/cm 2 or g. If they do not multiply as a result of a higher environmental temperature, the population of pathogenic bacteria present is then reliably eliminated during adequate cooking, either entirely or to an amount that does not suffice to induce illness.",

    "abstract": "Bovine brucellosis, caused by Brucella abortus , is a serious zoonotic disease manifested by reproductive disorders resulting in huge economic losses to dairy farmers. A random survey was conducted to study the epidemiology of brucellosis in Punjab (India) using sampling software Survey toolbox. Two-stage sampling procedure was adopted; in the first step, villages were selected randomly from sampling frame of all the villages of Punjab followed by selection of owners, and animals in individual farms were identified using random sampling. In all, 32 villages were selected and then 345 animals (approximately 5%) were sampled from these villages. The milk samples collected were screened for brucella antibodies employing ELISA test. The overall apparent prevalence of brucellosis was found to be 18.26% (true prevalence - 17.68%). The prevalence in the central zone of the state was significantly higher, viz. 23.2% (chi square = 11.34, p &lt; 0.01) compared to 14.2% in the sub-mountainous zone and 5.8% in the arid irrigated zone. The disease prevalence was found to be non-significantly higher (chi square 1.029, p = 0.310) in cattle (20.67%) compared to buffaloes (16.41%) and increased with age (chi square = 8.572, p &lt; 0.05) in both species. There was significant association between disease and abortion (chi square = 22.322, p &lt; 0.01) and maximum abortion cases due to brucellosis were found in &gt; 6 month of gestation (95.7%). The disease was significantly associated with the retention of placenta (chi square = 8.477, p &lt; 0.01), however there was no significant relationship of the disease with repeat breeding (chi square = 0.044, p = 0.834). The results of the study suggested that the accurate epidemiological scenario of the disease may be obtained by employing multistage sampling procedures using milk-based ELISA.",

The haematological and biochemical indices were assessed in fish immediately and 24 h after anaesthesia. The results showed that despite no mortality occurred after anaesthesia in both 125 mg l -1 of MS-222 and 0.075 ml l -1 of eugenol, these chemical substances severely influenced the constituents of Siberian sturgeon blood and resulted in some histological changes in the gills and liver. Both eugenol and MS-222 anaesthesia caused erythrocyte swelling and haemolysis. The severe depletion of leukocyte number occurred 24 h after both eugenol and MS-222 anaesthesia (mainly due to depletion of lymphocyte, neutrophil segments and eosinophil fractions). Total protein, total globulin, triacylglycerol concentration and alanine aminotransferase activity in blood plasma was significantly elevated ( p &lt; 0.01) after both eugenol and MS-222 anaesthesia. The concentration of Ca 2+ , inorganic phosphate, NH 3 and alkaline phosphatase activity were significantly decreased ( p &lt; 0.01) compared to control. No significant changes were noticed in the albumin and glucose concentrations and the activity of lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotrasferase and creatinkinase. Results of the examinations suggest that the use of MS-222 (125 mg l -1 ) and eugenol (0.075 ml l -1 ) does not cause irreversible damage in Siberian sturgeon.",

Noise stimuli of both 80 dB and 100 dB intensities for 10 min induced a significant elevation in plasma corticosterone levels. Broilers that were exposed to noise stimuli of 100 dB also exhibited a significant increase in the cholesterol level and total protein level. Exposure to noise stimuli did not influence the glucose level and triglyceride concentrations. The duration of tonic immobility was not affected by noise stimuli in our experiment. However, noise exposure at a 100 dB level decreased the number of attempts to induce tonic immobility in broilers.",

The experiment was conducted on 5 groups of horses (49 animals): one control and four groups undergoing different types of exercises. The saliva samples were collected 3 × a day: late at night (between 20:00 and 23:00 h), early in the morning (between 5:00 and 8:00 h) and directly after the exercise. The concentration of cortisol was measured by the enzyme-immunoassay programme. The highest cortisol concentration was observed for the horses participating in 3-day events (8.93 nmol/dm 3 ), whereas in the control group it was only 0.28 nmol/dm 3 . When compared to the cortisol concentration of other horse groups, this suggests that the stress level as measured by the cortisol concentration in saliva increases with increasing exercise intensity and its duration. The obtained results do not confirm the existence of a day rhythm of the cortisol concentration in horses. Moreover, the results may help in choosing the appropriate system of training and in improving horse welfare during competitions.",

    "abstract": "Essential oils are plant secondary metabolites possessing various pharmacological properties, primarily anti-oxidative, antimicrobial or immunomodulative, but they can exhibit toxic and allergic effects as well. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of Rosmarinus officinalis essential oil dietary administration in carrageenan paw oedema and trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) colitis. ICR mice received rosemary essential oil at three concentrations (1 250, 2 500 and 5 000 ppm) in the standard laboratory diet starting two weeks before the experiments. The inflammation of paws induced by carrageenan application was evaluated by measurement of paw swelling, paw weight and myeloperoxidase activity. In the TNBS model the mice were killed by cervical dislocation 3 days after colitis induction and the mortality, changes in the body weight of mice, colon weight : body weight ratio, macroscopical scores and myeloperoxidase activity were analysed. Furthermore, IL-1β and IL-6 cytokine levels in colonic tissue were quantified using ELISA assay. Dietary supplementation with 5 000 ppm of rosemary essential oil initially after 2 h increased but after 24 h suppressed the extent of paw oedema. The same dose in the TNBS model exhibited protective effects on colonic mucosa and significantly decreased macroscopic scores for colonic inflammation. On the other hand, in colon samples from mice fed the diet with 1 250 ppm of rosemary essential oil we detected decreased myeloperoxidase activity and significantly lower levels of IL-6 compared to TNBS control animals. Our results indicate that rosemary essential oil is able to influence several variables of murine experimental inflammatory models depending on the concentration used. We conclude that the anti-inflammatory effects of rosemary essential oil should be interpreted carefully due to its timeand dose-related effects.",

The first group was control without supplementation and infection, the second group was infected and without oil supplementation, the third group was supplemented with oils (10 ml·100 g -1 rates) for one week and infected with Y. ruckeri and the last group was oil supplemented without infection. Results indicated that fish fed with dietary supplements showed enhanced bactericidal activity, total protein, albumin, cholesterol, triglyceride and bilirubin compared to the control ( P &lt; 0.05). As the value of herbal oils was increased in diets, the plasma glucose level decreased. The levels of K, Na, Ca, and Mg increased whereas Cl values decreased, compared to the control. It can be concluded that diet supplementation with herb oils used in this study can increase disease resistance by increasing levels of some biochemical parameters and electrolytes in rainbow trout to Y. ruckeri infection.",

Sulphate-reducing bacteria are often associated with the occurrence of the disease. The physiological properties of intestinal sulphate-reducing bacteria including kinetic characteristic of their growth have never been reported. The aim of this research was to evaluate the presence of sulphate-reducing bacteria isolated from the intestines of mice, study their growth, calculate and compare the kinetic growth properties on the model of dextran sulphate sodium induced ulcerative colitis in the mice. The number of viable intestinal sulphate-reducing bacteria from the bowel lumen of mice with ulcerative colitis was higher ( P &gt; 0.05) by 22% at 12 h of cultivation compared with cultures of sulphate-reducing bacteria from the bowel lumen of healthy mice. The sulphate-reducing bacteria from mice with colitis also had a slightly higher generation time (14.29 h) and exponential growth phase (22.24 h) compared with cultures from healthy mice. The time of lag-phase was 2 × shorter ( P &gt; 0.01) in the cultures of sulphate-reducing bacteria from mice with ulcerative colitis. The described research is new and important for the prediction of the sulphate-reducing bacteria number in the gut and their rate of dissimilatory sulphate reduction. The kinetic characteristic of their growth is important for further clarification of the mechanisms of sulphate reduction and accumulation of hydrogen sulphide, which is toxic for epithelial cells of the intestine and can cause bowel diseases both in humans and animals, in particular ulcerative colitis.",

The aim of the present study was to compare the effect of the length of a progestagen treatment (12 d vs. 6 d) on synchronization efficiency (oestrus response, time to onset of oestrus and duration of oestrus) and fertility rate using fluorogestone acetate (FGA) progestagen sponge treatment with pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) administration applied at different times of sponge removal. Ewes (n = 68) were divided into two groups; long term (LT, n = 33) and short term (ST, n = 35) groups treated with FGA progestagen sponges. At the end of intravaginal sponge treatment period the animals of each group were divided into the 3 subgroups in relation to time of PMSG (300 IU) treatment. PMSG treatment was applied 24 h before sponge removal, at sponge removal and 24 h after sponge removal for LT1 and ST1, LT2 and ST2, and LT3 and ST3, respectively. Each ewe was inseminated intra-cervically twice with skim cow milk-diluted semen (1000 × 10 6 motile cells/ml) 40 h and 60 h after sponge removal. Non-return rates (NRR-30) were monitored from 12 day after sponge removal to 30 day with the aid of teaser rams. Onsets of oestrus response and oestrus cessation were significantly different ( P &lt; 0.05) between the ST and LT treatment groups. Synchronization of oestrus was tighter in LT than ST group. Except for oestrus cessation, other indicators studied were not different in the ST subgroups. In the ST subgroups the oestrus cessation of the ST1 (88.7 ± 15.4 h) was the shortest and differed from ST3 (120.0 ± 14.2 h) ( P &lt; 0.05). No statistical difference was observed among all studied indicators for LT groups according to application time of PMSG ( P &gt;).

    "abstract": "An entomological survey for sand flies was conducted from May to October 2006 in a village near an endemic focus of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Cukurova Plain, south Anatolia, Turkey. Standard CDC light traps, CO2 traps, sticky traps, mouth aspirators, animal-baited traps and human landing collection were used to determine species composition, density and nocturnal activity of sand fly species. BG-Sentinel Trap, a novel monitoring trap originally developed to attract mosquitoes, was also tested to investigate its efficiency for sand flies. Overall, 4 048 specimens belonging to four species of genus Phlebotomus Rondani et Berté 1840 and two of genus Sergentomyia França et Parrot 1920 were collected. Phlebotomus tobbi Adler, Theodor et Lourie 1930, the proven vector of Leishmania infantum Nicolle 1908 was found to be the most abundant (65.6%) species while P. sergenti Parrot 1917, the proven vector of L. tropica (Wright, 1903) in Turkey accounted for 0.1% of the sand flies that were identified. Other species, P. perfiliewi galilaeus (Theodor 1958), P. papatasi (Scopoli, 1786), Sergentomyia dentata (Sinton, 1933) and Sergentomyia theodori (Parrot, 1942) represented 31%, 2%, 1.5% and 0.3 % of the sand fly fauna, respectively. Aggregate population of sand flies was found to be the lowest in May. Population size rose through June and July, with the highest peak in August, and decreased through September and October. Among the traps used, CO 2 traps were found to offer a more suitable and productive method than others for both estimating the species composition and the population density of sand flies in the study area. Studies on the nocturnal activity indicated that even the number of captures declined rapidly during dusk period, between 04.00 and 06.00 h, in general, no significant hourly pattern was determined neither the species prevalence nor the nocturnal activity of the species. According to statistical analysis the variation in hourly nighttime temperature did not influence the nocturnal activity of the species whereas the number of collected sand flies during nocturnal period was strongly associated with relative humidity.",

Rainbow trout exhibited total loss of balance and no response to external stimuli with shorter induction time as dosage increased (120.5 s, 64.4 s and 44.3 s, respectively). Goldfish exhibited total loss of balance and no response to external stimuli after induction time that varied with dosage used and body size of fish. The small fish (1.5-7 cm) exhibited shorter induction time which ranged from 84.28 s at 75 mg·l -1 clove oil to 41.14 s at 150 mg·l -1 clove oil. The larger fish had a longer induction time inversely related to the dosage. Recovery time was longer than induction time in both species. Both species recovered within 6 min after anaesthesia at 150 mg·l -1 clove oil. Clove oil did not produce marked changes ( P &lt; 0.05) in the physiological indicators of goldfish compared to the control.

Samples of muscle, liver (hepatopancreas), kidney, gonads and gills were analyzed. Hg, Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn and Cr concentrations in fish tissues were determined by the AAS. The results showed that different metals differ in their affinity to different fish tissues (e.g. Cu - liver, Cd - kidney). Mercury concentrations along the food chain increase, i.e. higher mercury concentrations are found in predatory fish. Contrary to mercury, cadmium and lead concentrations do not show any increases along the fish part of food chain in surface water ecosystems. In predatory fish, lower concentrations of these metals were found than in nonpredatory fish species. Differences in concentrations between ovaria and testes were found only in Cu and Zn. To evaluate possible health risks of mercury concentrations for consumers, the risk index was calculated and maximum admissible amounts of muscle meat for consumption were determined. The results confirmed good hygienic quality of market-ready fish from the Věstonice reservoir.",

    "abstract": "Teleost fish include many different species, having a large economic and environmental impact. Glucose is a key source of energy for most vertebrate organisms. Fish as well as mammals maintain a specific level of blood sugar – glycaemia, which is influenced by multiple factors such as hormone production, diet, and temperature. Therefore, it is a useful indicator for scientists who need to check the immediate state of an organism. The most frequently used method of measuring glycaemia in farmed fish is spectrophotometry; however, this method is often inconvenient for field experiments. Here we report that basic spectrophotometry using oxidation of blood beta D-glucose by glucose oxidase (used in laboratory conditions) can be easily substituted with portable glucometer measurements, primarily designed for human samples. The possibility of use outside the laboratory and its small sample volume demands make this method very useful. Field studies often require fast sample processing and conditions of measurement are limited. Using the glucometer is a simple and elegant option. We tested 74 blood plasma samples (29 males, 45 females) of tench ( Tinca tinca ) both spectrophotometrically and using the human glucometer. Our results show a significant linear correlation ( P &lt; 0.001) between both methods. The main contribution of this study consists in comparability and interchangeability of results obtained from both presented methods.",

Chicken embryos in the experimental groups (Wi-Fi) were continuously exposed (24 h per day) to Wi-Fi radiation at a frequency of 2.4 GHz and an average power density of 300 µW/m 2 for 9 and 14 embryonic days (ED). Subsequently, the CAM samples from the control (CO) and experimental (Wi-Fi) groups were histologically processed and evaluated. The samples stained with haematoxylin and eosin did not reveal any notable differences in the structure of large blood vessels between the CO and Wi-Fi groups. However, the use of special staining methods showed adverse effect of Wi-Fi on the fibrous elements within the blood vessel wall. The optical density (OD) of elastic fibres significantly decreased from 0.294 ± 0.025 (CO 9) to 0.197 ± 0.022 (Wi-Fi 9) at ED 9 and from 0.706 ± 0.028 (CO 14) to 0.271 ± 0.031 (Wi-Fi 14) at ED 14. On the other hand, at ED 9, the OD of collagen fibres exhibited a notable increase from 0.178 ± 0.023 (CO 9) to 0.334 ± 0.020 (Wi-Fi 9). However, at ED 14, there was a significant decline of collagen fibres from 0.418 ± 0.033 (CO 14) to 0.327 ± 0.031 (Wi-Fi 14). Our results support the hypothesis that Wi-Fi could affect the fibrous elements of the large vessel wall and may play a role in the development of different cardiovascular disorders.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to elaborate a histological model of incisional skin wound healing in Sprague-Dawley rats. Under aseptic conditions two paravertebral full thickness skin incisions were performed on the back of 42 anesthetized male rats. Histological sections from tissue specimens were stained by hematoxylin and eosin, van Gieson, PAS + PSD, Mallory's phosphotungstic hematoxylin and azur and eosin and evaluated during the first seven days after surgery. Histological evaluation revealed that the regeneration of injured epidermis was completed five days after surgery. The inflammatory phase was recorded during the first three days of healing with the culmination of this phase between day one and day two. The beginning of the proliferative phase was dated to the first day and the peak during day five and day six. The initiation of the maturation and remodeling phase of the healing process was observed six days after wounding. At the layer of striated muscle, the centronucleated cells were described for the first time six days after surgery. The wound healing process of rat skin was histologically described during the first seven days. Results of this work can serve as an experimental model for further research using external pharmacological and physical factors (laser light, magnetic field) by which the wound healing can be favourably influenced.",

Acute toxicity values of clove oil for European catfish found were 10minLC50 76.70 mg l -1 ; 10minLC0.1 49.60 mg l -1 ; 10minLC99.9 118.50 mg l -1 ; 96hLC50 18.40 mg l -1 ; 96hLC0.1 10.70 mg l -1 ; and 96hLC99.9 31.90 mg l -1 . Individual phases of anaesthesia and recovery were determined. The 10-min exposure to clove oil at a concentration of 30 mg l -1 caused a significant ( p &lt; 0.05) increase in the concentration of triacylglycerols (TRIG), alanin aminotransferase (ALT) and decreased ( p &lt; 0.05) in mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) immediately after anaesthesia. The leukocyte counts were significantly ( p &lt; 0.05) decreased 24 hours after anaesthesia. A significant ( p &lt; 0.05) decrease of percentage distribution lymphocytes was found immediately after anaesthesia. On the other hand, percentage and absolute count of myeloid cells were increased. Increased percentage count of eosinophils outlasted 24 hours after anaesthesia, absolute counts of these cells were consistents with control. Histological examination showed capillary ectasia of gill filaments immediately after clove oil anaesthesia. Twenty-four hours after anaesthesia, no ectasia was observed. No histopathological changes were demonstrated in other tissues following anaesthesia. Results of the examinations suggest that the use of clove oil at a concentration of 30 mg l -1 does not cause irreversible damage in European catfish.",

    "abstract": "The death of animals during transport for slaughter is a major factor indicating the level of welfare in transported animals. However, research data that report the level of animal welfare as reflected in transport-related mortality rates of individual animal species and categories are missing. The present study focused on losses of pigs and cattle in the period from 1997 to 2006. Transport-related mortality rates were recorded by species and categories of animals and also for the following travel distances: up to 50 km, 51-100 km, 101-200 km, 201-300 km, and over 300 km. Rates differed according to species and category. The highest mortality rates were found in young sows, sows, and boars (0.2562%) followed by fattened pigs (0.1075%), excluded dairy cows (0.0396%), calves (0.0269%), and fattened cattle (0.0069%). Significant differences were found among mortality rates ( p &lt; 0.05). The lowest mortality rates occurred with shorter travel distances (&lt; 50 km and 51-100 km) when compared to long travel distances (101-200 km, 201-300 km and &gt; 300 km), with a significant difference ( p &lt; 0.05) between short and long travel distances being found in fattened pigs, fattened cattle and dairy cows. Mortality rates in animals during transport for slaughter show young sows, sows, and boars to be the most susceptible to transport-related stress, followed by fattened pigs, dairy cows, and calves, whereas the highest resistance was observed in fattened cattle.",

    "abstract": "Plant essential oils are plant secondary metabolites possessing various pharmacological properties, primarily anti-oxidative, antimicrobial or immunomodulatory ones. The aim of this work was to study the effects of thyme essential oil dietary administration in murine DTH/ CHS reaction, carrageenan paw oedema and TNBS colitis. Thyme essential oil was added to the murine diet at three concentrations (5000, 2500 and 1250 ppm) and fed to Balb/c mice. The extent of ear swelling in DTH/CHS reaction and paw oedema induced by carrageenan application was measured using the Mitutoyo thickness gauge. In the model of TNBS colitis we evaluated the changes in body weight, the colon weight : body weight ratio, bacterial translocation to mesenteric lymph nodes, and macroscopical and histological scores. IL-1β and IL-6 messenger RNA expression in colonic samples of one experimental group were assessed using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. Dietary supplementation with 5000 ppm of thyme essential oil significantly decreased paw oedema and ear swelling. This thyme essential oil concentration caused a significant inhibition of total mRNA IL-1β expression in the mouse colon, and markedly decreased the macroscopic and microscopic scores of colitis. On the other hand, the 1250 ppm of thyme essential oil in diet increased ear oedema induced by oxazolone application in mice. Our study indicates that thyme essential oil is able to affect murine experimental inflammatory models depending on the concentration used. It is concluded that the anti-inflammatory effects of thyme essential oil should be interpreted with a caution due to its contradictory, dose-related effects.",

Three different doses of testosterone (0.25; 2.5 and 25 ng), not exceeding a physiological range, were examined in three separate experiments. Testosterone propionate dissolved in 20 μl olive oil was injected into the yolk before the onset of incubation. Behaviour of newly hatched chicks was recorded in response to both a novel environment in the open-field test and manual restraining in the test of tonic immobility (TI). Behavioural consequences of embryonic exposure to elevated testosterone were observed in the open-field test in all three experiments which indicated inhibition of behavioural responses in hatchlings. Birds treated with testosterone in ovo displayed longer latency to leave the start square, decreased locomotor activity, enhanced defecation and lower number of distress calls as compared to control birds. In TI test, the influence of treatment was manifested at the highest concentration only. Hatchlings from testosterone treated eggs expressed longer duration of TI and required less attempts to induce TI in comparison with the control group. Our results demonstrated increased fearfulness of Japanese quail chicks hatched from eggs with experimentally elevated testosterone content. The effect is specific for a short period after hatching since previous studies reported stimulatory effect of yolk testosterone on behaviour of Japanese quail later in ontogeny.",

Acute phase proteins - haptoglobin (Hp) and serum amyloid A (SAA) - and variables of protein metabolism - total proteins, albumin, urea, creatinine, total immunoglobulins - were evaluated in blood serum. Significant differences were found in average values of the Hp and SAA concentrations in several groups during the monitored period ( P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively). The Hp and SAA concentrations in cows during the early postparturient period were significantly higher compared with the later postparturient period. Throughout the monitored time we found differences in mean values of total proteins ( P &lt; 0.001), urea ( P &lt; 0.001), and total immunoglobulins ( P &lt; 0.05). The concentrations of albumin decreased progressively in the postparturient period until 4 weeks after parturition.

The above mentioned results indicate that in the time around parturition there are significant changes in concentrations of acute phase proteins, as well as in the whole protein metabolism of dairy cows. These facts suggest that the postparturient period is a critical biological phase, throughout which there is the highest incidence of metabolic disorders.",

This work presents the quality characteristics of honey samples (n = 72) processed using traditional methods and on sale in various important beekeeping zones in Kenya: West Pokot, Baringo, Mwingi, Tana, North Kinangop, Mbeere, Nandi Hills, Mida Creek, Kakamega and Taita. The quality of the honey was compared to international standards as proposed in the Codex Alimentarius. The quality markers analyzed were moisture, hydromethylfurfural (HMF), sugar content, diastase, proline content, and free acidity. Moisture was determined using a honey refractometer, HMF and Diastase content were determined through spectrophotometry, sugars were determined by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), proline was determined through spectrophotometry and free acidity quantified by volumetry - titration technique. Average constituent values were at 16.00 - 21.20% (moisture); 3.70 - 389.36 mg/kg (HMF); 20.83 - 300.6 mg/kg (proline); 8.03 - 56.98 Schade units (diastase); 57.03 - 102.66% (fructose and glucose levels) and 18.00 - 71.85 50 mg/kg (free acidity). Most of the samples had constituent levels within the limits set in the Codex Alimentarius. Traditional honey harvesting and processing methods seem not to have negative effects on the major honey constituents. However, excessive smoking during harvesting had compromised the aroma and flavour of some samples. In an effort to promote beekeeping as an eco-friendly, sustainable alternate source of livelihoods, training in best apiculture practices, improved extension services and establishment of honey marketplaces is being done to improve honey quality in Kenya.",

A total of 84 ISA Brown laying hens were divided into three groups. Each group consisted of seven cages with four hens per cage. Groups received diets differing in combinations of oils. The diet fed to group E1 contained 1.50% LO and 3.5% FO, group E2 had diets with 2.5% LO and 2.5% FO, and group E3 was fed diets with 3.5% LO and 1.5% FO. Contents of fatty acids in oils, diets and egg yolks were analyzed. The egg yolk content of α-linolenic acid (α-LNA) and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) in total fatty acids was increased ( P &lt; 0.001) due to the increased content of linseed oil in hen diet and it was the most favourable in group E3. In groups E1, E2 and E3, the α-LNA content was 3.25%, 4.33% and 5.18%, respectively, and the n-3 PUFA content was 6.80%, 7.22% and 8.50%, respectively.

Increased concentration of linseed oil and reduced concentration of rapeseed oil in diets resulted in less SFA ( P &lt; 0.001) and more n-3 PUFA in egg yolks.

Groups 3 and 4 received the same feed as chickens in groups 1 and 2 but with a highly reduced amount of supplemented nutrients in the organic \"proteinated\" form (Bioplex Cu 2.5 mg kg -1 , Bioplex Fe, Bioplex Zn, Bioplex Mn 10 mg kg -1 ), except for selenium which was given at the dose of Se 0.3 mg kg -1 as sodium selenite or selenized yeast (Sel-Plex), respectively. The diet supplemented with the restricted doses of trace elements in proteinated forms (50% Cu, 20% Fe, Zn, Mn and a regular level of Se) had the same effect on the indexes of growth performance (such as the body weight on days 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 of life, total feed intake, feed conversion ratio, carcass yield and abdominal fat of chickens) as well as on the concentration of Cu, Fe, Zn and Mn (except for Se) in the breast and thigh muscle of broilers at the age of 21, 35 and 42 days as did the diet with the recommended doses of minerals in the form of inorganic salts. Unlike sodium selenite, the proteinated form of Se (selenized yeast) is able to build a significant deposit of this element in the muscle of broilers at the age of 21, 35 and 42 days.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the oxidant and antioxidant status by measuring glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase (CAT) activities and malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) concentrations before and during pregnancy in ewes. Twelve healthy female and two healthy male Awassi sheep, aged 4-5 years, weighing approximately 50 - 55 kg each, were used in the study. The ewes’ blood samples were taken before synchronization and during pregnancy (on 25th days of each month of pregnancy). Plasma MDA concentrations in the 2nd and 3rd months of pregnancy in ewes were lower than in the 1st, 4th, 5th months of pregnancy and in the non-pregnant ewes. GSH concentrations and GSH-Px activities during pregnancy were increased ( P &lt; 0.01). GSH concentrations and GSH-Px activities were the highest in the 2nd and 3rd months of pregnancy. CAT activities were decreased after the 1st month of pregnancy in ewes ( P &lt; 0.001). They were the lowest in the 2nd and 3rd months of pregnancy. The findings of our study show decreased CAT activities and elevated GSH concentrations and GSH-Px activities after the 1st month of pregnancy in ewes. These changes in the indicators under study may indicate a predisposition to oxidative stress in the 2nd and 3rd month of pregnancy in ewes.",

    "abstract": "The seeds of sweet lupine cultivars ( Lupineus species ) have been used with increasing frequency as a source of proteins replacing proteins of animal origin or soybean in feed compounds. The seeds of sweet lupine cultivars contain an average of about 33-40% crude protein in dry matter, the lipid content ranges from 5 to 13%. The profile of amino acids is relatively beneficial, however, with slightly lower content of lysine (1.46%) and methionine (0.22%). The main storage carbohydrates in the seeds are the β-galactans that comprise most of the cell-wall material of the kernel and the cellulose and hemicellulose of the thick seed coats. Lupine seeds contain about 40% non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) and a negligible amount of starch. High coefficient of protein digestibility (&gt; 90%) has been reported in sweet lupine cultivars, but lower digestibility of energy (~ 60%). Lupineus species contain negligible amounts of trypsin inhibitor so they do not require preheating before being used as an ingredient in feeds for monogastric animals. The efficiency of lupine seeds in the diets for pigs is characterized by controversial results of growth and feed conversion under both mechanical treatment and enzyme supplementation. The results of production efficiency obtained at the testing of lupine cultivars ( L. albus , L. angustifolius ) for pigs were beneficial at supplementation of the lacking nutrients or dehulling. The submitted paper summarizes national as well as foreign knowledge of the nutritive value of cultural lupine seeds, and deals with the possibility increasing nutrition and production efficiency in the diets for pigs.",

The results of this study indicate that the housing systems compared had no significant effect on the blood plasma mineral profile of laying hens under study and the values were within the physiological range. However, a significant effect of housing system on eggshell breaking strength and eggshell weight was found. Improved eggshell quality was obtained in most periods of the laying cycle in the enriched cage systems.",

The aim of this study was to determine the acute toxicity of clove oil in two aquarium fish species - zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) and guppy ( Poecilia reticulata ), which are considered the most commonly used model organisms in toxicity testing. The semi-static method according to OECD no. 203 (Fish, Acute toxicity test) was used for testing the toxicity of clove oil for juvenile fish. A series of 5 acute toxicity tests was performed, with 10 fish of both species used for each concentration and for the control. The results obtained (number of dead individuals at particular test concentrations) were subjected to a probit analysis using the EKO-TOX 5.2 program in order to determine 96hLC50 clove oil values. The significance of the difference between 96hLC50 values in D. rerio and P. reticulata was tested using the Mann-Whitney non-parametric test. The 96hLC50 mean value for clove oil was 18.2 ± 5.52 mg·l –1 in juvenile D. rerio and 21.7 ± 0.8 mg·l –1 in P. reticulata . In spite of variability in clove oil composition, acute toxicity values of clove oil for juvenile stages of both fish species were comparable. The results did not show different sensitivities to clove oil in tested fish species. This is the first similar study in these fish species.",

Analysis was performed on 116 ejaculates collected from 6 Duroc boars and 9 Pietrain boars. The boars selected for examination were young and at the beginning of their reproductive utilization. Ejaculates were collected at monthly intervals over the period of 10 months. Microscopic slides were prepared immediately after collection of ejaculates. The slides were examined to assess the frequency of morphological abnormalities. Moreover, morphometric measurements were taken from 15 randomly selected morphologically normal spermatozoa. Also, conventional evaluation of ejaculates was made following methods used at Polish sow insemination centres. Differences were found in the dimensions and shape between Duroc and Pietrain spermatozoa. Pietrain spermatozoa were characterised by significantly smaller head perimeter compared with Duroc ( P ≤ 0.01). Moreover, Pietrain spermatozoa tails were by 0.8 μm longer ( P ≤ 0.01), and their total sperm length was greater by 0.5 μm compared to Duroc ( P ≤ 0.05) sperm. The volume of Duroc ejaculates was lower but their sperm concentration was greater. The results of the present study contribute to scientific progress as they demonstrate differences in sperm size between boars of different breeds, which may be reflected in different reproductive performances of the boars.",

The inhibitory effect of MAGs (monocaprylin, monocaprin, monolaurin, monomyristin, monopalmitin, MAG of undecanoic and 10-undecenoic acids) at a concentration of 25 – 1500 mg·l -1 was observed. Growth of bacteria in the presence of MAG was studied by means of optical density of bacteria for 24 h. The data were modelled through a Gompertz equation and the lag-time, the maximum specific growth rate and the maximal value reached were calculated. MAGs inhibited mainly the growth of gram-positive bacteria, which was shown by the extended lag-time, decrease in specific growth rate and decrease in cell density. Inhibitory effects of tested MAGs could be ranked from point of view of the minimum inhibitory concentration: MAG-C12:0 &gt; MAG-C11:0 &gt; MAG-C10:0 &gt; MAG-C14:0 &gt; MAG-C11:1 &gt; MAG-C8:0 &gt; MAG-C16:0. In vitro , no significant inhibitory effects of 1-monoglycerides, with the exception of the highest concentrations applied, on the growth of gram-negative bacteria were detected. The main contribution of this study is to compare the effects of several MAG containing fatty acids with a medium chain under the same conditions on the growth indicators of bacteria.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this work was to study the changes in chlorophyll contents in green teas stored under different conditions and to suggest the most suitable way and length of green tea storage. A secondary aim was to evaluate the possibility of using the chlorophyll content as an indicator of tea freshness. Samples for analysis were obtained from a range of tea-growing regions. Chlorophyll contents were measured using UV-vis spectrophotometry. Chlorophyll absorbance was measured at 642.5 and 660 nm. Prior to storage, chlorophyll concentration in teas ranged from 1.12 to 1.89 mg per 1 g of tea, which corresponded to data given by other authors. Storage was found to lead to a decline in chlorophyll concentration. From the 6 th month of storage onwards, a significant decrease ( P &lt; 0.05) was observed in all samples, irrespective of storage conditions. Based on the findings of this study, original and metal packaging can be considered the most chlorophyll-friendly. On the other hand, glass and paper packaging stored in direct daylight were found to have the strongest impact on chlorophyll concentration. Overall, it can be concluded that the storage time can have a strong influence on oolong green tea colour as an important qualitative variable. Thus, the shelf-life of tea should be shorter than the 12 months claimed by most manufacturers. Once the relationship between changes in chlorophyll concentration and length of the storage period had been established, the chlorophyll content was suggested as an indicator of the storage time (freshness) of a tea substance.",

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of ketoprofen in surface waters on fish under experimental conditions. Subchronic toxic effects on 300 embryos and larvae of common carp ( Cyprinus carpio ) were investigated during a 30 day toxicity test with concentrations of ketoprofen: 0.003, 2.1, 6.3 and 21 mg/l. The exposure to ketoprofen showed no effect on mortality, but we observed significant delay ( P &lt; 0.05) in hatching in day 3 in fish exposed to all concentrations of ketoprofen. Significant delays ( P &lt; 0.05) in development were revealed at 2.1, 6.3 and 21 mg/l ketoprofen. On the basis of weight and growth rate evaluation and the determination of developmental stages, the lowest observed effect concentration was 0.003 mg/l. According to these results, the reported environmental concentration of ketoprofen in Czech rivers could have a negative effect on the growth and development of carp embryos and larvae. These tests have not yet been performed. Further research and search for a mechanism to reduce the incidence of ketoprofen in the waters by better wastewater treatment is required.",

The production of plastics is increasing dramatically throughout the world and is considered to be a serious threat for the aquatic environment. Scientists started to raise questions as to where all the disappeared plastic debris had gone, as the plastic material is a persistent synthetic polymer. The disappearance of plastic suggests that microplastics are generated by fragmentation of larger plastic debris. They also enter the aquatic environment from the cosmetics, clothing, and other industrial manufacturing. Microplastic particles spread in the aquatic, terrestrial, and atmospheric environments due to their small size and ubiquity, showing their high bioavailability. The presence of microplastics has been demonstrated in the digestive tracts of most aquatic organisms at various trophic levels. Evidence of negative effects of microplastics has been found in relation to fertility, mortality, oxidative stress, immune system or metabolic processes.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this work was to verify the hepatoprotective effects of Silybum marianum seed cakes in feed mixtures used for the fattening of chicken broilers to heavier weights. Part of the experiment was to verify the preventive effect of such modified feed mixtures with the use of chlortetracycline medication. The experiment was carried out on 180 ROSS 308 broiler chickens. The chickens were fed complete feed mixtures containing 0.0% (K), 0.2% (P1 and 1.0% (P2) of Silybum marianum seed cakes. The cakes used contained 2.95% of silymarin. On the 44th day of fattening half of the chickens from every group were supplied with chlortetracycline medicated water at a dose of 2 g kg 1 live weight. The selected biochemical indices were observed: cholesterol (Chol), glutamyl transferase (GMT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). On the 52nd day of the test, six chickens from each group were euthanized and their liver was taken for histological examination. Adding Silybum marianum seed cakes resulted in a non-significant decrease in the chickens' live weight and in the feed conversion in both experimental groups compared to the control group. The cholesterol levels were highly significantly lower ( p &lt; 0.01) on the 43rd day in group P2, and significantly lower ( p &lt; 0.05) on the 52nd day in group P1 when compared to the control group (K). Also the ALT and AST activity was lower ( p &lt; 0.01) in both experimental groups on the 22nd day of the experiment. On the 52nd day the lower activity ( p &lt; 0.01) was found only for AST in both experimental groups. In the chlortetracycline medicated group P2, cholesterol level ( p &lt; 0.05) as well as ALT activity and AST activity decreased ( p &lt; 0.01), compared to the medicated control group. Results of biochemical analyses were also confirmed by histological examination of the liver. Administration of silymarin reduced ( p &lt; 0.01) the content of lipids and increased the content of glycogen in the liver of both experimental groups.",

    "abstract": "Transport-related mortality rates were compared for various poultry species and categories where published data are limited. The numbers of broilers, hens and cockerels, turkeys, ducks, and geese transported for slaughter, and the numbers that died during such transport, were recorded from 1997 to 2006 in cooperation with the State Veterinary Administration of the Czech Republic. The mortality rate for individual poultry species and categories was calculated overall, and was also recorded for the following transport distances: up to 50 km, from 51 km to 100 km, from 101 km to 200 km, from 201 km to 300 km, and over 300 km. Transport of poultry for slaughter was accompanied by varying mortality rates depending on poultry species and categories. The highest mortality rates occurred in hens and cockerels (1.013%), followed by turkeys (0.272%), broilers (0.253%), ducks (0.103%), and geese (0.056%). Differences among the mortality rates estimated were highly significant ( p &lt; 0.001). Mortality rates highly correlated with transport distance. The lowest mortality rates were for the shortest transport distances: In broilers (0.154%), turkeys (0.164%), and hens and cockerels (0.595%) for a transport distance up to 50 km; and in ducks (0.069-0.111%) and geese (0.021 - 0.053%) for transport distances up to 300 km. Highest mortality rates in hens and cockerels (1.892%), turkeys (0.341%), and broilers (0.536%) were observed for transport distances over 200 km, while in ducks (0.147%) and geese (0.253%), highest mortality rates were with transport distances exceeding 300 km. The highest mortality rates for all transport distances were in hens and cockerels, followed by turkeys and broilers. The mortality rate in turkeys for a transport distance up to 50 km was significantly higher than that in broilers. No significant differences were found between mortality rates in turkeys and broilers for transport distances of 51-100 km and 101-200 km whereas, for a distance of 201-300 km and in distances exceeding 300 km, the mortality rates in broilers were significantly higher compared to turkeys. The lowest mortality rates were observed in ducks and geese, with a significant difference between them only for transport distances of 51 to 100 km, where the mortality rate in ducks was higher, and over 300 km, where the mortality rate in geese was higher. When planning the transport of poultry for slaughter, susceptibility to stress induced by transport and transport distance (i.e. the duration of transport) of poultry species and categories should be considered.",

In order to achieve this, a total of 407 serum samples of cattle from 27 herds having history of abortions were examined for Brucella antibodies by RBPT and SAT. In addition, the sera collected from 246 farmers (130 males and 116 females) and 28 veterinarians in the same district were analysed serologically by RBPT, SAT and ELISA. Of the cattle sera analysed, 134 (32.92%) and 141 (34.64%) were determined as positive by RBPT and SAT, respectively. Thirty-two (13%), 35 (14.22%) and 44 (17.88%) of the farmers' sera were found positive for brucellosis by RBPT, SAT and ELISA, respectively. There was no significant difference between sexes for Brucella seropositivity. Of the 28 sera from veterinarians, 13 (46.42%) were positive by the three serological tests. The high prevalence of brucellosis both in cattle and humans suggests that brucellosis is common in this area. Preventive and control measures should be implemented and pursued more strictly to reduce and/or eradicate brucellosis from the area.",

Hyperlipidaemia was induced with butter ad libitum and oral intubation of cholesterol 400 mg/kg body weight. Simvastatin, (Tablet survive®) was used as a synthetic cholesterol lowering drug. The results suggest that 2 g/kg T. ammi seed powder produced hypolipidaemic activity, rendering 49%, 53%, 71% and 63% reduction in total lipids, triglycerides, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, respectively. However, at this dosage level 62% increase in the value of HDL-cholesterol was induced by T. ammi seed powder. Nonetheless, 0.5 g/kg and 1 g/kg T. ammi seed powder did not show antihyperlipidaemic activity. T. ammi seed powder at the rate of 2 g/kg and simvastatin (0.6 mg/kg body weight) were equally effective in treating hyperlipidaemia in albino rabbits. Moreover, this dosage level also significantly reduced the cholesterol content of liver tissue. It can be anticipated that the lipid lowering mechanism may involve enhanced removal or catabolism of lipoproteins, inhibition of HMG COA reductase, and/or inhibition of lysosomal lipid hydrolytic enzymes secreted by the liver.",

Meat was obtained from Galloway, Simmental, Charolais, Czech Fleckvieh breeds and their crossbreeds. Meat was either unaged or aged for 14, 28 or 42 days. The tenderness was characterized by Warner-Bratzler test and compression test using Tira-test device. The cooking loss of meat juice was also evaluated. Analysis of variance at 5% significance level showed that tenderness was influenced by all tested factors (breed, sex, aging time). The shear force decreased with aging of meat. The correlation between shear force and compression test was 0.257 ( p ≤ 0.001). The differences in tenderness were found among breeds. The highest initial shear force was measured in Simmental (151.98 N). Compression test showed better tenderness in Czech Fleckvieh and Galloway than in Simmental, Charolais and crossbreeds. Meat from bulls was significantly ( p ≤ 0.001) less tender than from heifers. There was a significant ( p ≤ 0.001) increase of cooking loss of meat juice during aging from 25.3% after slaughter to 34.0% after aging period. The research results could be useful for determination whether specific cattle breeds can produce tender meat with good aging patterns. According to findings of the current study it is especially necessary to emphasize that factor of aging time exceeded the influence of breed and sex on tenderness. The study also suggests extending of aging period to 6 week to assure tenderness of beef.",

Furthermore, it was found that the MIC of CA can be decreased by even low addition (0.05%) of citric or acetic acid and to a lesser extent by lactic acid, whereas the MICs of OEO did not notably decrease. Combined application of CA and OEO determined by FIC index led only to an additive effect (0.5 ≤ FIC ≤ 1).

    "abstract": "The aim of our study was to investigate histopathologically the incidence of gastrointestinal tract tumours in dogs in the Czech Republic in relation to their age, sex and breed. In total, 29 gastric and 45 intestinal tumours from 3827 gastrointestinal tract biopsies were investigated. The average age of dogs with gastric lymphoma, adenocarcinoma, and other mesenchymal tumours was 7.3 years, 9.5 years, and &gt; 10 years, respectively. Breed predisposition to adenocarcinoma was evidenced in the Belgian Shepherd and Leonberger, to lymphoma in the Doberman ( P &lt; 0.01). The most frequent site of adenocarcinoma was antrum pyloricum (66.7%); lymphomas involved gastric wall diffusely. The average age of dogs with intestinal adenoma, adenocarcinoma, lymphoma, leiomyoma or leiomyosarcoma and carcinoid was 7.5, 8.5, 8.5, 12, and 14 years, respectively. The age predisposition to intestinal adenoma and lymphoma was 7–8 years ( P &lt; 0.01) and to adenocarcinoma 7–8 years ( P &lt; 0.05); mesenchymal tumours occurred at the age of 11–12 years ( P &lt; 0.01). Breed predisposition to intestinal adenoma was evidenced in the Pug, Leonberger and English Setter ( P &lt; 0.01), to adenocarcinoma in the English Setter ( P &lt; 0.01) and Hovawart ( P &lt; 0.05), to lymphoma in the Doberman and Hovawart ( P &lt; 0.05). The most frequent site of occurrence of intestinal tumours was the colorectal region. The study revealing breed, sex and age predisposition to gastrointestinal tumours in dogs has not been described yet in the literature.",

Alfaxalone at a dose rate of 5 mg/kg was administered to thirteen adult male green iguanas via the ventral caudal vein following 24 h fasting. The induction time, tracheal tube insertion time, surgical plane of anaesthesia interval, and full recovery time were recorded. Systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure (measured indirectly), pulse rate, respiratory rate, SpO 2 and ETCO 2 were recorded. The induction time and tracheal tube insertion time was 41.54 ± 27.69 s and 69.62 ± 37.03 s, respectively. The time from the alfaxalone administration to the loss of toe-pinch reflex was 2.20 ± 1.47 min. Full activity was restored 14.23 ± 4.15 min after the initial alfaxalone administration. The respiratory rate increased significantly ( P &lt; 0.01) from 4.3. ± 3.2 to 6.8 ± 1.6 breaths per min and a gradual decrease of ETCO 2 from 43.65 ± 10.54 to 26.58 ± 8.10 mmHg ( P &lt; 0.01) was noted from the second to the 13 th min after alfaxalone administration. The pulse rate, SpO 2 and blood pressure did not change significantly. Intravenous use of alfaxalone proved to be a suitable and safe form for short term anaesthesia in green iguanas.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory diseases of cattle, particularly in young animals, represent the most important health and economic problem of cattle rearing. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the changes of selected blood indices in 25 calves aged 2–9 months suffering from etiologically undifferentiated chronic respiratory diseases. Blood samples were analysed for haematological indices and selected serum biochemistry variables. The results found in sick animals were compared with results from 25 healthy animals of the same age, housing and feeding system. Significant differences in means between the groups of clinically healthy and sick calves were found in 13 out of 24 evaluated indicators. In sick animals we found significantly higher mean concentrations of haemoglobin and total number of white blood cells ( P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01, respectively), as well as higher mean activity of AST and LDH ( P &lt; 0.01), concentrations of total proteins and total immunoglobulins ( P &lt; 0.001). Significantly lower mean values were recorded in the serum concentrations of albumin, creatinine and glucose ( P &lt; 0.001), as well as in the concentration of Mg ( P &lt; 0.01), P ( P &lt; 0.001), Fe and Zn ( P &lt; 0.05). The presented results suggest the effect of respiratory diseases in calves on several changes of haematological and selected serum biochemical indicators. They indicate that respiratory diseases did not lead only to direct disturbance of gas exchange and acid-base balance, but they also indirectly affect some other variables of blood biochemistry.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to develop an innovative method for measuring the activity level of pigs in a barn in real time. An infrared-sensitive camera was placed over two pens of the piggery, images were recorded for 24 h a day for eight days during the fattening period, and the activity and occupation indices were calculated every second in real time using software. In the laboratory, the recorded images were visually labelled to score the animals’ behaviour adopting the Martin and Bateson’s Scan sampling method, and to find a relation with the automatically measured activity index. Pigs’ behaviour was assigned in the following way, 0 - no activity, 1 - fighting or struggling, 2 - biting one another, 3 - abnormal behaviour as nuzzling or suckling one another (interacting pigs), 4 - feed assumption time. Pigs spent most of the time lying inactively (82–90% of the time), following a diurnal rhythm with peaks related to the feeding administration routine; fighting episodes occurred very rarely (0.05–0.10% of the time). Based on the analysis of the automatically measured group activity index compared to the manual labelling, a relation was found between the activity index and the behaviour types (no activity, nuzzling and feeding). The novelty presented in this study was the development of on-line tools to monitor farm animals continuously during their life, in a fully automatic way, with objective measures and criteria without imposing additional stress to the animals.",

    "abstract": "Determination of the physiological electrophoretic patterns in animals is very useful for clinicians in diagnosing healthy and sick animals. The objective of this study was to investigate the serum protein electrophoretic pattern in cows, sheep, and goats in order to evaluate the differences in the size and number of protein fractions between the evaluated ruminant species. Ten adult multiparous high-yielding dairy cows, 10 adult female sheep and 10 adult female goats were included in this study. All the evaluated animals were clinically healthy. Serum was analyzed for total serum protein concentrations, and for the relative and absolute values of protein fractions with calculation of albumin/globulin ratios. Serum protein fractions were separated by zone electrophoresis on buffered agarose gel. Serum protein electrophoresis identified 6 distinct bands, comprising albumin, alpha 1 - (α 1 ), alpha 2 - (α 2 ), beta 1 - (β 1 ), beta 2 - (β 2 ), and gamma- (γ) globulins in cows. In sheep, serum proteins exhibited 6 fractions: albumin, α 1 -, α 2 -, β-, γ 1 - and γ 2 -globulins. In goats, serum proteins were separated into 5 fractions: albumin, α 1 -, α 2 -, β- and γ-globulins. Significant differences in the relative as well as absolute means were found for the albumin/globulin ratio and most of the protein fractions, except γ-globulins. No significant differences were found in the concentration of total proteins. These results describe the marked species differences in most of serum protein fractions between the evaluated groups of animals, and contribute to the current knowledge about the physiological electrophoretic pattern of serum proteins in ruminants, which can be used for diagnostic purposes.",

    "abstract": "Carcinoma of the prostate is a commonly occurring malignant tumour in men and is a common cause of death. Early diagnosis and therapy is crucial for the successful treatment of this serious disease. It is therefore desirable to develop a sufficiently reliable, minimally invasive, and inexpensive method of diagnosing prostate cancer, which would usefully supplement the diagnostic techniques currently in common use (digital rectal examination, measuring the prostate-specific antigen level in serum, transrectal ultrasonography). This article describes in detail the methodology of a new technique for intensive training aimed at developing the dog’s olfactory abilities to diagnose carcinoma of the prostate in men while the animal is still young. At the same time, the rate of success in establishing the diagnosis of prostate cancer in men using this method was evaluated based on the identification of urine samples from patients in whom the disease was histologically confirmed. The results of our study demonstrate that the diagnosis of prostate cancer in men using the olfactory abilities of a specially trained dog can be considered a reliable, non-invasive, and relatively inexpensive method of diagnosing carcinoma of the prostate.",

Cow's milk samples (n = 30) were spiked with tetracycline, chlortetracycline, and oxytetracycline in the range of 10-400 µg/l. Chemometric models to quantify each of the tetracycline's residues were developed by applying Partial Components Regression and Partial Least Squares algorithms. The Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy model was used to differentiate between pure milk and milk sample with tetracycline residues. The best models for predicting the levels of these antibiotics were obtained using Partial Least Square 1 algorithm (coefficient of determination between 0.997-0.999 and the standard error of calibration from 1.81 to 2.95). The Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy model showed well-separated groups allowing classification of milk samples and milk sample with antibiotics. The obtained results demonstrate the great analytical potential of chemometrics coupled with mid-infrared spectroscopy for the prediction of antibiotic in cow's milk at a concentration of microgram per litre (µg/l). This technique can be used to verify the safety of the milk rapidly and reliably.",

One hundred and fifty Ross 308 hybrid cockerels were used in the present study. The control group (HS0) was fed without hempseed expellers; the other two groups received diets containing 50 g·kg -1 and 150 g·kg -1 of hempseed expellers (HS5 and HS15, respectively). The birds were slaughtered at the age of 37 days, and samples of breast and thigh muscles were collected for determination of proximate chemical composition and technological properties, and sensory analyses. Feeding with hempseed expellers influenced the colour of meat with a significant difference observed for a* (redness) and b* (yellowness) values in the HS15 group. The colour of breast meat in HS15 group is more intense compared to HS5 and HS0 groups. Breast meat was evaluated as the best in terms of odour for HS15 group compared to HS0. The colour of thigh meat was better rated in the HSE supplemented groups compared to the controls. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with hempseed expellers appears to affect the colour and odour of broiler chicken’s meat which is positive for the consumers. Including hempseed cakes can be recommended as a component of broiler chicken’s feed.",

The patient group consisted of 30 calves of the Simmental breed, 0–28 days old, diagnosed with ASP upon clinical examination, anamnesis, auscultation examination, and radiographic results. The control group consisted of 10 healthy calves, otherwise with the same characteristics. A significant difference was found between calves with ASP and the control group of calves in serum iron (Fe, P &lt; 0.001), total iron-binding capacity (TIBC, P &lt; 0.05), PON1, TSA, procalcitonin, neopterin, and total leukocyte count (WBC) indices as a result of the analyses ( P &lt; 0.001). Serum procalcitonin concentration was found to be 285.71 ng/ml in the ASP group and 30.34 ng/ml in the control group. Serum neopterin concentration was found to be 37.68 nmol/l in the ASP group and 15.14 nmol/l in the control group. Serum procalcitonin, neopterin, and TSA concentrations were found to be significantly higher in the ASP group compared to the control group. It was concluded that biomarkers such as serum procalcitonin, neopterin, and TSA are high in calves with ASP, and as a result, these markers provide diagnostically and prognostically important information.",

Eighteen paraffin-embedded intestinal tissues, six from each group, were studied in the healthy control (C), cancer control (CC), cancer + TCAE (C-TCAE) groups. Sections of 5 µm thickness were taken from the paraffin blocks and submitted to staining with haematoxylin-eosin. In the histopathological examination, the number of crypts forming aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and the degree of dysplasia in the crypts were scored. Real-time PCR analysis was completed to determine β-catenin, KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma virus), APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) and P53 expressions on samples from each paraffin block. The grading scores of the number of crypts forming ACF and dysplasia in the crypts showed an evident decrease in the C-TCAE group in comparison to the CC group ( P &lt; 0.05). In real-time PCR analysis, mRNA expression levels of P53 ( P &gt; 0.05) and APC ( P &lt; 0.001) genes were found to be increased in the C-TCAE group according to the CC group. The expression levels of KRAS ( P &lt; 0.01) and β-catenin ( P &lt; 0.005) mRNA were found significantly decreased in the C-TCAE group. In conclusion, the effects of TCAE on AOM-induced colorectal cancer (CRC) in rats were evaluated molecularly; TCAE was found to modulate some changes in CRC developmental pathways, inhibiting tumour development and proliferation, and stimulating non-mutagenic tumour suppressor genes. Thus, it can be stated that TCAE is an effective chemopreventive agent.",

The aim of this research was to investigate pesticide residues in different honey types and to assess the risk to public health. A total of 88 honey samples originating from pine, multifloral, sunflower, acacia, linden, and canola were collected and analysed by a QuEChERS method. The hazard quotient (HQ) was used to evaluate the risk of detected pesticide residues. Analysis of pine honey did not detect any residue of investigated pesticides. The most frequently detected pesticides in the honey samples were chlorpyrifos ranging between 15.1 µg/kg (linden honey) to 22.3 µg/kg (multifloral honey), clothianidin ranging between 12.0 µg/kg (acacia honey) to 22.0 µg/kg (canola honey), dimethoate ranging between 8.9 µg/kg (multifloral honey) to 18.9 µg/kg (canola honey), and thiamethoxam ranging between 4.2 µg/kg (linden honey) to 15.6 µg/kg (canola honey), respectively. The lowest estimated daily intake (EDI) of 128 × 10 -3 μg/kg of body weight per day was found in acacia honey, and the highest EDI of 265 × 10 -3 μg/kg of body weight per day was found in canola honey. Similar values of EDI were determined for multifloral, sunflower, and linden honey (186 × 10 -3 , 187 × 10 -3 , and 183 × 10 -3 ), respectively. The HQ value for pine honey was 0 indicating that this honey is the safest for consumption, however, the other types of honey investigated in this study posed no risk to humans after potential consumption.",

Trial groups (6 pigs each) were treated over the whole body twice, with one week interval in between; one group was left as untreated control. All the preparations used inhibited the development of and were more or less lethal to mange mites. Tea tree and citronella volatile oil preparations proved to be the most effective (viability of mites &lt; 5% in 4 weeks). The most active extract of tested ethanol solutions was obtained from hogweed seeds: after two treatments of pigs, 57-93% of parasites died in 2-4 weeks. The extracts of local plants tansy and wormwood diminished the number of mites up to 44% within the first week after treatments. The results indicate that plant extracts may be further tested in practice as alternatives to drugs of synthetic origin.",

    "abstract": "Brominated flame retardants (BFRs) are organic substances frequently used in many industries. The most important group within BFRs are polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Because they persist in the environment, accumulate in food chains and have toxic effects, they are a potential health risk both for animals and humans. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers may disrupt processes of hormonal regulation in living organisms by reducing thyroxine concentrations in the plasma of the exposed individuals. In vitro studies have demonstrated the ability of these substances to bind to estrogen and androgen receptors. Tests on rodents have also demonstrated neurotoxicity of some of the PBDEs. Although industrial use of PBDEs is now regulated to a large extent, PBDEs have already been detected in areas with no apparent industrial load, e.g. in Greenland. This article presents an overview of BFRs-related issues with a particular emphasis on PBDEs, describes toxic effects of those substances and their metabolism in living organisms, and discusses issues related to the incidence of PBDEs in the environment.",

    "abstract": "The morphological characteristics of peripheral blood cells, micronucleated erythrocytes counts and plasma biochemistry profile were examined in ten healthy captive European pond turtles Emys orbicularis . Blood samples were obtained from the caudal vein. The Wright staining method was used for the classification of the blood cells. Mature erythrocytes of captive Emys orbicularis were nucleated ellipsoidal cells (21.7 ±1.27μm × 13.2 ±1.12 μm) with pink cytoplasm. The nucleus (6.9 ± 0.78 μm × 5.4 ± 0.65 μm) was centrally located and stained dark purple. Seven different types of blood cells were determined: erythrocytes, thrombocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes and heterophils. The micronucleated erythrocyte (MNE) values were 0.0016 and 0.003 for the males and females, respectively. The MNE results were presented as the mean frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes per 1000 cells per animal. The mean plasma concentrations in the total of specimens were as follows: total protein (25 g/L), albumin (7.2 g/L), globulin (17.8 g/L), glucose (2.91 mmol/L), calcium (2.32 mmol/L), phosphorus (1.55 mmol/L), creatinine (46.85 μmol/L), urea (10.93 mmol/L) , triglycerides (0.44 mmol/L), cholesterol (1.48 mmol/L), sodium (125.76 mmol/L), potassium (3.98 mmol/L), chloride (93.94 mmol/L), iron (13.34 μmol/L) and activities of aspartate aminotransferase (2.14 μkat/L), alanine aminotransferase (0.15 μkat/L), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (2.15 U/L), amylase (8.09 μkat/L), lactate dehydrogenase (19.93 μkat/L).

Its role in feed conversion, carcass characteristics, meat quality and sensory parameters was analyzed. Four groups of pigs (n = 10, 5 males and 5 females) with the body weight of 24 kg were fed semi-ad libitum for 90 days the following diets: control group (C) - diet containing 3% of fish meal, experimental group (1) - diet containing 5% of non-heat-treated amaranth grain and 5% of dried surface biomass of amaranth, experimental group (2) - diet containing 5% of popped (heattreated) amaranth grain and 5% of dried surface amaranth biomass, experimental group (3) - diet containing 10% of lupine seed meal. Animal protein substitution in diets with amaranth (group 1, 2) or lupine (3) did not result in significant differences ( p &gt; 0.05) in average daily body weight gain in comparison with the control group (C - 0.83 and 0.82, 0.80 and 0.79 kg in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively).

The study was performed in a herd of Holstein cattle with the average milk yield of 8,562 kg. Thirty-five dairy cows housed in one group were included in the study. Blood and milk samples were taken during two separate milk yield checks done 4 weeks apart. Actual milk production of monitored cows ranged from 19.6 to 62.6 l daily. For lactation stages we evaluated results of examinations performed from 7 to 188 days of lactation. Blood examinations showed that the cows included in our study had good supplementation with the microelements in question. Milk concentrations of individual microelements were as follows: 3855.2 ± 814.7 μg/l of Zn; 36.3 ± 14.4 μg/l of Cu; 20.1 ± 8.3 μg/l of Mn, and 28.6 ± 7.1 μg/l of Se. The effect of daily milk production on milk concentrations of the microelements was identified only for copper (r = -0.302, p ⪬ 0.05). The variable of days of lactation (not considering days of the colostrum period) showed a positive correlation in manganese (r = 0.419, p ⪬ 0.01); copper and selenium showed negative correlations (Cu: r = -0.258, p ⪬ 0.05; Se: r = -0.277, p ⪬ 0.05). The daily milk production influenced negatively only Cu concentration in milk, but Se, Zn and Mn was not influenced.With advancing lactation after colostrum period the concentration of Mn in milk raised, the concentration of Cu and Se declined and the concentration of Zn was unchanged.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to monitor the course of physical and chemical changes taking place in stored fresh chilled muscle tissue of carp packed in modified atmosphere (MAP), and to determine its shelf life. Samples of muscle tissue of common carp ( Cyprinus carpio , L.) were packed in MAP (80% O 2 , 20% CO 2 ) and stored for 15 days at +2 ± 2 °C max. During the storage period, O 2 level in packs decreased from 78.7 ± 0.39% (day 1) to 63.8 ± 1.30% (day 15). Decrease in O 2 in packs between storage days 7 and 9 was highly significant ( p &lt; 0.01). During storage, muscle tissue pH decreased during the experiment from 6.46 ± 0.22% (day 1) to 6.17 ± 0.10% (day 15). Levels of N-substances of low-molecular character increased during the experiment from 12.33 ± 2.11 (day 1) to 20.07 ± 3.16 mg 100 g -1 (day 15). Hydrolytic lipid decomposition (FFA) was more intensive in carp muscle tissue (2.09 ± 1.07% total lipid as oleic acid) than in carp skin (1.01 ± 0.31% total lipid as oleic acid) (day 15). Lipid oxidation (PV) in skin showed differences from lipid oxidation in muscle tissue. Oxidation processes in muscle correlated positively with the length of storage (r = 0.90). Over the storage period, peroxide levels increased from 2.58 ± 1.19 mekv O 2 kg -1 (day 1) to 6.76 ± 1.78 mekv O 2 kg -1 (day 15). Because of low TVBN levels in muscle tissue, shelf life was limited mainly by sensory changes (green discoloration, odour deviations, slime production), which were observed from storage day 9 onwards. It was found that the maximum shelf life of carp packed in MAP (80% O 2 , 20% CO 2 ) was 7 days. The optimum parameter to determine the remaining shelf life of common carp muscle tissue stored at +2 ± 2 °C max is the TVBN level. As concerns shelf life, TVBN levels in carp muscle should not exceed 15 mg 100 g -1 . This level of TVBN (max. 15 mg 100 g -1 ) for carp (MAP 80% O 2 , 20% CO 2 ) is much more lower in comparison with levels TVBN (max 25 - 35 mg 100 g -1 ) which have been determined by Commission Regulation (EC) No. 2074/2005 for sea fish. For that reason we suggest to amplify the study by other monitoring (higher number of samples, various breeds of carp in different weight categories for all the year). On the basis of these analyses the level of TVBN for carp could be determined and incorporated to the legislation.",

Heritability of various behaviors - hunting ability, playfulness, and aggression to people and other dogs - has been calculated. The neurotransmitters believed to be involved in aggression are discussed. The gene for aggression remains elusive, but identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with breed-specific behavior traits are leading us in the right direction. The unique syndrome of aggression found in English Springer Spaniels may be a model for detecting the gene involved.",

The control group (CD) was fed a concentrate mixture and hay and grazed twice daily, while the second (YS3) and third (YS6) groups were fed the same diet supplemented with 3 or 6 g of live yeast culture (Yea Sacc 1026 ), respectively. The treated groups had significantly higher values ( p &lt; 0.05) for fat corrected milk (FCM) (1221, 1116 and 940 g/day, for YS6, YS3 and CD group, respectively) and fat-protein corrected milk (FPCM) (1204, 1103 and 931 g/day, for YS6, YS3 and CD group, respectively), while the values for milk yield, fat yield and lactose yield were higher ( p &lt; 0.05) only in the YS6 group compared to the CD group. Milk yield values were constantly higher in the YS6 group than in the control group while the values for the YS3 group were more variable during milking. Milk composition was not significantly affected by yeast supplementation with the exception of urea values which were lower ( p &lt; 0.05) in the YC6 group. Yeast administration influenced β-hydroxy-butyrate (BHB) values, which were higher ( p &lt; 0.05) in the treated groups; and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) values, which were higher ( p &lt; 0.05) only in the YS6 group compared to the control group. Other blood biochemistry values were not influenced by the treatments. We conclude that supplementation with live yeast culture, under the conditions of our experiment, had a significant effect on the performance and metabolism of grazing dairy ewes during the machine milking period. Based on more constant results, we could recommend the inclusion of live yeast culture (Yea Sacc 1026 ) at 6g/animal/day as appropriate for field conditions.",

For this purpose, 480 Ross-308 chicks were assigned to two groups, Control and Test, each with 4 replications. The pens of the Test Group were enriched with perches and sand bedding. At the end of the study, 8 males and 8 females whose live weights were close to the group average from each group were slaughtered. Their blood was collected and serum was separated. For chemical analysis of the chicken meat, whole carcasses of 4 males and 4 females, and half of the breast and left thigh from the remaining 4 males and 4 females were collected. In the carcass group, whole carcass with its bones was minced, whereas in the other groups breast and tight meat were separated from the bones and minced in a meat grinder, homogenized with an electronic mixer, then flash frozen (-40 °C, 8–10 h) and stored (-20 °C, 3–4 weeks) until analysed. There was no significant difference between the groups in body weight, daily weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion and survivability.

The control group received feed mixture consisting of wheat and barley. In the experimental group, 3% proportion of wheat was replaced by sodium humate. The results of nutrient digestibility showed significantly lower ( P &lt; 0.01) digestibility of crude protein (82.2 ± 1.92 vs. 87.9 ± 2.05%) and crude fat (32.0 ± 2.81 vs. 49.3 ± 2.25%) in the control group compared to the experimental group.

The results confirmed sorption ability of humate fed to pigs. The decrease of coefficients of apparent digestibility in nitrogen substances can lead to decreased amounts of ammonia into the environment of the stables.",

At 25 weeks of age, layers were randomly assigned to 14 experimental groups, each comprising 6 hens kept in individual cages. A 2 x 7 factorial arrangement, with two dietary levels of calcium and phosphorus (normal - 37.0 g Ca/kg, 6.5 g P/kg, and reduced - 32.5 g Ca/kg, 6.0 g P/kg), and with diets supplemented by selected additives (none; inulin, 7.5 g/kg; oligofructose, 7.5 g/kg; short chain fatty acids (SCFA), 5.0 g/kg; medium chain fatty acid (MCFA), 2.5 g/kg; SCFA, 3.0 g/kg + MCFA, 2.0 g/kg; inulin, 3.0 g/kg + SCFA, 5.0 g/kg) was used. The experiment was conducted for 45 weeks and concluded when the hens were 70 weeks old. At 70 weeks of age, reducing the dietary levels of Ca and P had decreased the bone breaking strength by 8.9% ( P &amp;#x2AAC 0.001) and the yielding load by 5.6% ( P &amp;#x2AAC 0.05). A similar tendency for bone breaking strength ( P &amp;#x2AAC 0.05) and stiffness ( P &amp;#x2AAC 0.05) was found in the femur bones. The diet with a lower level of Ca and P negatively affected the geometrical indicators of the bones such as cortex thickness ( P &amp;#x2AAC 0.05) and cross section area ( P &amp;#x2AAC 0.05), but had no effect on bone weight and length. Hens fed diets supplemented with oligofructose, MCFA, SCFA + MCFA or inulin + SCFA displayed a significantly higher bone breaking strength and yield load in the tibia bone than that of the control group. In the case of femurs, a positive influence of MCFA or simultaneous addition of inulin + SCFA on bone breaking strength was found. The additives had no significant effects on the geometrical indicators of either bone. It was concluded that selected feed additives which lower the pH of the diet and intestinal content can beneficially affect the biomechanical indicators of the bones of high-productive laying hens.",

The highest total viable counts, counts of Enterobacteriaceae and psychrotrophic bacteria were determined in double frozen trout. The light microscopy of fresh trout muscles did not show any microstructural changes, whereas deformations of muscle fibres and optically empty areas were found in frozen trout. Remarkable defects of the muscle structure in double frozen trout were demonstrated and total disruption of muscle fibres was found. The freezing of trout resulted in various structural changes in the dorsal skeletal musculature. This is a first study comparing changes in fresh, frozen and repeatedly frozen trout.

With respect to potential adopters, bitches were the preferred sex in Czech shelters. Young abandoned dogs up to the age of one year had the shortest length of stay (median 19 days), whereas older dogs had the longest length of stay, i.e. dogs in the age range of 7–9 years (median 53.5 days) as well as dogs older than 9 years (median 54 days). Abandoned dogs over 65 cm at the withers, i.e. giant dogs, and abandoned dogs up to 35 cm at the withers, i.e. small dogs, had the shortest length of stay in Czech shelters, with medians of 16 days and 21 days, respectively. Medium-sized dogs, i.e. dogs measuring between 35–50 cm at the withers, and large dogs, i.e. dogs measuring between 51–65 cm at the withers had the longest length of stay in shelters. A better understanding of factors that negatively affect the adoption process in abandoned sheltered dogs can significantly shorten the length of stay of such dogs in Czech shelters and help to improve the adoption process itself as well as the welfare of sheltered dogs.",

    "abstract": "In animal production, alternative strategies to the use of antibiotic growth promoters have stimulated research of dietary supplements to increase resistance, reduce post-weaning gut disorders and growth checks in pigs. This study was performed to determine the influence of dietary mannan oligosaccharide as a potential alternative to antibiotic growth promoters in weaned pigs on: (1) proliferation of circulating and intestinal immune cell subsets, (2) incidence and severity of diarrhoea, and (3) performance during 35 days of trial. Forty-six pigs from a commercial farm were divided into two groups comprising 23 pigs each and treated at 4 weeks of age as follows: controls received standard weaner diet, whereas diet for principals was supplemented with 0.2% of mannan oligosaccharide. The pigs were monitored/sampled on daily, weekly or monthly basis for feed efficiency, growth rate, diarrhoea severity scores, blood samples, rectal swabs and intesinal samples for bacterial isolation/counts and immunohistology/histomorphometry analyses. The principals were heavier ( P &lt; 0.05) at 28 days and grew faster between days 7 and 28 compared to controls. Total diarrhoea score recorded in these pigs was decreased by 20.37%. Total bacterial load in jejunum was decreased in these pigs (23 × 10 7 vs. 19 × 10 8 colony forming units/ml) at day 35. Between days 28 and 35 or days 21 and 28, the principals increased in proportions of circulating CD45 + , CD4 + , CD21 + , CD8 + cells ( P &lt; 0.01), respectively. These pigs had increased ( P &lt; 0.05) the number of CD45RA + cells in interfollicular and follicular areas of ileal Payer’s patches at day 35. We concluded that dietary modulation with mannan oligosaccharide resulted in stimulation of immune responses and reduced number of gut microbiota, but not necessarily promoting the growth of pigs.",

    "abstract": "The level of compliance with livestock welfare requirements is directly reflected in animal health, behaviour, and performance as well as farm profitability. It is mandatory to keep animals in conditions that prevent suffering and that respect animal needs in terms of biology and ethology. Compliance with these obligations in the Czech Republic is supervised by the State Veterinary Administration (SVA) through inspectors affiliated to the veterinary administrations at the regional level. The aim of the study was to identify the main deficiencies observed during official site visits carried out at livestock holdings in 2016–2020 and to assess the trend of the most frequently occurring deficiencies during the reference period. Data obtained from Central Veterinary Administration of the SVA containing a total of 9,147 records of partial welfare checks were subjected to the analysis. The percentage of site visits where deficiencies were found at livestock holdings was 15.04%. When analysed in more detail, the results revealed a significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) highest frequency of violations with respect to administration and animal marking (2,054) followed by the provision of treatment and spatial conditions. The trend analysis showed no significant increase or decrease in the frequency of violations in the selected areas during the reference period ( P &gt; 0.05). The results show the need to focus on compliance with duties in the framework of administration and animal marking, provision of treatment, and provision of animal management standards, especially in terms of spatial conditions, nutrition, and animal hygiene where violations were consistently found most often.",

    "abstract": "The goal of the study was to test the possibility of raising milk zinc (Zn) concentration by increasing the supplementation of Zn, and to assess the effect on the somatic cell count. The experiment was performed at a farm with Czech Pied cattle, with 500 dairy cows and average milk yield 6,390 l. The experiment included 40 dairy cows, assigned to either an experimental (E, n = 20) or a control group (C, n = 20) based on the principle of balanced pairs (efficiency, lactation stage). The experimental group was supplemented Zn in the chelate form (Bioplex Zn, Alltech Inc., Nicholasville, KY), at the dose of 440 mg Zn per animal per day. Blood and milk samples were taken at the start of the experiment and at the end of months 1, 2 and 3. The average milk Zn concentration during the experiment was 57.36 ± 10.54 μmol l -1 , ranging from 38.02 to 86.13 μmol l -1 . A trend towards a positive effect of Zn supplementation on the health of the mammary gland was identified in association with the somatic cell count, which was significantly lower in the experimental group (114.90 ± 68.7 10 3 ml -1 vs. 208.60 ± 148.1 10 3 ml -1 ; p &lt; 0.05) by the end of month 3. A negative correlation was found between the somatic cell count and Zn concentration in milk (y = -0.0327 x + 61.557; r = -0.441; p &lt; 0.01). Our results indicate that milk Zn concentration is not directly affected by the level of zinc supplementation in the feed ration, but zinc supplementation has a positive effect on the somatic cell count.",

The chemical analyses were carried out in frequently grown lupin varieties in Europe (AMIGA, ANDA, ATU, BORUTA, BUTAN, DIETA, JUNO, KARO, PRIMA, ROSE, SONET and WATT) and two locally grown varieties of soybeans (KORADA and VISION). The contents of individual substances in analysed lupin seeds showed large differences in chemical composition of individual lupin varieties (crude protein: 317.06 - 458.86 g kg -1 ; lipids: 52.15 - 125.76 g kg -1 ; fibre: 101.21 - 154.23 g kg -1 ; non-nitrogenous extractive substances: 285.94 - 436.47 g kg -1 ; starch: 41.31 - 102.65 g kg -1 ; organic matter: 951.75 - 966.24 g kg -1 ; ash: 33.76 - 48.25 g kg -1 ; calcium: 2.29 - 5.10 g kg -1 ; phosphorus: 4.62 - 8.04 g kg -1 ; magnesium: 1.36 - 2.51 g kg -1 ; acid detergent fibre: 133.13 - 209.25 g kg -1 ). Lupin seeds were characterized by high contents of crude protein; in some varieties they significantly exceeded the content of crude protein in soybeans. In contrast to lupine seeds, soybeans contained a significantly higher content of lipids and lower content of fibre including acid detergent fibre. In lupin seeds, a negative correlation coefficient was found between the crude protein and BNLV content (r = -0.93) and between crude protein and starch content (r = -0.79). A positive correlation (r = 0.76) was found between the starch and BNLV content in lupin seeds. The results of the study provide information not only for growers regarding the choice of individual lupin varieties, but also for breeders who intend to use lupin seeds as suitable components for feed rations and mixtures.",

Lipolysis was monitored by the dilution extractive method. At a storage temperature of 4 °C for 4 months no enzyme processes were observed, whereas at a storage temperature of 24 °C a marked enzyme activity was found during maximum 3 weeks as well as sensory changes of UHT milk.

After six days of storage, α-casein, β-casein and κ-casein dropped to 69 ± 10%, 56 ± 16% and 43 ± 10%, respectively. Majority of changes in UHT milk depended on the B. cereus strain used, initial microbial counts and the method of heat inactivation of spores.",

The animals (n = 40) were divided into four groups: the first group included late pregnant cows (n = 10) from the 10th to 4th day before calving; the second group included late pregnant cows (n = 10) from the 4th to 1st day before calving; the third group included clinically puerperal healthy cows (n = 10), whereas the fourth group included puerperal cows with clinical symptoms of ketosis (n = 10). Samples of liver and blood tissues were taken from all cows. Pathohistological examination of liver samples showed statistically significantly higher ( p &lt; 0.01) lipid infiltration in ketotic cows compared to healthy cows in late pregnancy and puerperium. Biochemical examination of blood serum showed significantly higher values ( p &lt; 0.01) of free fatty acids in ketotic cows, such as significantly lower blood concentrations of glucose ( p &lt; 0.01), triacylglycerols ( p &lt; 0.01), total cholesterol ( p &lt; 0.05), triiodthyronine ( p &lt; 0.05) and thyroxine ( p &lt; 0.05), compared to the values obtained in the blood serum in the groups of healthy cows before and after calving. In this study, significantly positive correlations were determined between the content of lipids in the liver and blood concentration of free fatty acids (r = 0.51; p &lt; 0.05) as well as the negative ones between the content of lipids in the liver and blood concentrations of glucose (r = -0.69; p &lt; 0.05), triacylglycerols (r = -0.55; p &lt; 0.05) and total cholesterol (r = -0.50; p &lt; 0.05) in the group of ketotic cows. Our investigations suggested that a hypothyroidal status was established in ketotic cows and that the blood concentrations of free fatty acids, triacylglycerols, total cholesterol and glucose served as major biochemical indicators in determining liver steatosis in the dairy cows in the transitional period.",

Only weak lethal effects were observed for both substances (the highest tested concentration 500 mg/L of both chemicals caused up to 11% mortality). On the other hand, we observed developmental malformations and reduced embryo growth at 5 mg/l and higher concentrations. However, the effects were not related to chlorination pattern as both SCCPs and dodecane induced qualitatively similar effects. SCCPs also significantly induced phase II detoxification enzyme glutathione S-transferase (GST) in Xenopus laevis embryos even at 0.5 mg/L, and this biomarker might be used as another early warning of chronic toxic effects. Our results newly indicate significant developmental toxicity of both SCCPs and n-dodecane to aquatic organisms along with inductions of specific biochemical toxicity mechanisms.",

The objective of this study was to compare two methods of staining in order to evaluate bull sperm viability after cryopreservation. A single batch of fresh and frozen semen from eight Holstein bulls was obtained for assessment of sperm viability and acrosomal status. Fresh and frozen-thawed semen samples were stained with eosin-nigrosin (EoNig) and the triple staining technique (TriSt) and evaluated under a light microscope. The results showed a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in the number of viable cells after cryopreservation with both techniques. A significant difference (P < 0.05) in viability on both fresh and frozen thawed sperm was observed when the two stains were compared. Differences in viability among bulls using both staining techniques were found on fresh samples, whereas in frozen-thawed sperm no differences were observed with the TriSt (P < 0.05). A marked decline (41.4 ± 11 S.D., P < 0.001) in the mean number of acrosome intact live sperm (AILS) was observed after cryopreservation using TriSt. In contrast, the EoNig technique overestimated the mean number of living sperm that could maintain their fertilizing ability on the frozen-thawed semen samples. In frozen-thawed semen TriSt showed a mean number of 33.4 ± 6.2 S.D. Concluding that EoNig as well as the TriSt, are useful tools for evaluating fresh semen samples, but when evaluating cryopreserved bovine semen, the TriSt offers more reliable results.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of feeding humic acid (HA) to pullets treated for 10 days on its concentrations in the organs and muscles. Forty pullets allocated to 4 groups with ten birds in each were used in the experiment. Control group (K) was fed the basic diet without supplementation. The second group (HA) was fed the basic diet with HA at the dose of 500 mg/chicken/day. Experimental group 1 (Pb) was fed basic diet containing lead acetate at the dose of 3.54 mg (1.42 mg Pb) per pullet/day and the second experimental group (Pb + HA) was moreover fed 500 mg HA/day. The lead content was determined in the samples of liver, kidney, bone and muscle tissue. Very low lead concentrations detected in the liver, kidneys and muscles of control group constituted the background, which reflected the current status of nutrition. The lead concentrations in the tissues were 4%, 12.6% and 10% of the highest admissible amounts (0.5 and 0.1 mg Pb/kg), respectively. In the experimental group (Pb), significantly increased lead concentrations were detected in liver, kidneys, bones ( P &lt; 0.001) and muscles ( P &lt; 0.05). The highest accumulation was found in bones (2.711 ± 0.59 mg/kg). Concurrent administration of HA and lead acetate (HA + Pb group) caused a significant decrease in the Pb content, i.e. by 30%, 43.8 %, 53.8 % and 50.6% in liver, kidneys, muscles and bones, respectively, in contrast to experimental group Pb. The values of selected biochemical indicators ranged in reference value limits, except the significant decrease of copper concentration in experimental groups.",

    "abstract": "The milk yield (MY) is an important economic and health factor closely connected with the health status of dairy cows, their reproduction performance, longevity and milk composition and properties (MIs). The differences within MIs between high yielding herd (Group 1; 10 282 kg per lactation) and three herds with average MY (Group 2; 7 926 kg) were tested. The files with 96 and 290 milk samples were collected in summer and winter feeding seasons and well balanced in lactation factors. Group 1 had higher genetical value, better nutrition and was milked three times per day and its MY was higher by 30% ( P &lt; 0.001). among 23 milk indicators (MIs) under study only a few MIs (30.4%) were influenced ( P &lt; 0.05): somatic cell count (SCC); urea (U); acetone (AC); pH acidity; alcohol stability; curd firmness; the ratio of urea nitrogen in non-protein nitrogen (URN). Except for U, these changes were less important. Protein spectrum was not affected ( P &gt; 0.05). The U was probably higher due to higher loading of the nitrogen nutrition (4.27 &gt; 3.57 mmol l -1 ) in MY 1. Surprisingly, SCC was higher (112 &gt; 81 10 3 ml -1 ) and AC lower ((0.0374) 0.0250 &lt; (0.0577) 0.0336 mmol l -1 ) in Group 1. Both the MIs did not indicate problems of the health status. An indicator of energy nutrition balance as fat/protein ratio was not influenced (1.15 ± 0.24 versus 1.16 ± 0.23; P &gt; 0.05), despite the large difference between MY 1 and 2. URN was higher in MY 1 (46.5 &gt; 39.1%) due to more efficient nutrition, like in U. The high MY had no negative impacts on MIs with well balanced nutrition of Holstein cattle.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to describe the effects of nickel (NiCl 2 ) on murine testicular structure. Experimental animals were injected intraperitoneally with a single dose of 20 mg NiCl 2 per kg of body mass (group A, n = 5) and 40 mg NiCl 2 per kg b. m. (group B, n = 5). The group without injection (n = 5) was the control (C). Animals were killed 48 hours after administration of nickel. The body mass of animals, the mass of testes and the testes : body mass ratio were not significantly affected. In both experimental groups a significant (p &lt; 0.001) decrease of germinal epithelium in comparison with control group was observed. The relative volume of the interstitium was increased but not significantly in both experimental groups. An increase in the relative volume of the lumen was registered in both experimental groups in comparison with the control group. The qualitative analysis detected a dilatation of blood vessels in the interstitium, undulation of the basal membrane and several empty spaces in the germinal epithelium. The diameter (n = 150) of the seminiferous tubule was markedly ( p &lt; 0.05) decreased in both experimental groups (A, B) compared to control group. The height of the germinal epithelium showed a significant decrease ( p &lt; 0.05 - 0.001) after nickel administration. Evaluation of the lumen diameter in the seminiferous tubule showed a significant increase in both experimental groups. The data of the perimeter of seminiferous tubules corresponded with those of the seminiferous tubule diameter. TUNEL assay detected a higher frequency of localized apoptosis in the interstitium of nickel-administered animals compared to control group. Our findings clearly suggest a negative effect of nickel on the structure as well as on the function of the seminferous epithelium at the site of spermatozoa production.",

For this purpose, Beetal goat farms (n = 18) were randomly selected, with natural mixed gastrointestinal nematodosis infection. In vivo (faecal egg count reduction test) and in vitro (egg hatch assay) tests were used to ascertain the presence of AR while a scorecard was used to determine the role of possible contributory factors for oxfendazole resistance. For in vivo test, the experimental animals were divided into two groups of 10 animals each; one group received OXF treatment, while the other served as control. Pre- and post-treatment coproculture was performed to identify the species and genera of nematodes. Egg hatch assay (EHA) was used to confirm the results of FECRT. Fecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) revealed the development of resistance on six farms and post-treatment larval cultures indicated Haemonchus contortus , Trichostrongylus colubriformis , Cooperia curticei , Teladorsagia circumcincta and Oesophagostomum spp. as dominant species with resistance. Furthermore, EHA confirmed the results of FECRT. Among the presumptive factors for AR, the highest composite score was for rotation of anthelmintics followed by treatment frequency, dose rate and nature of medication. The scorecard for the development of AR, used in this study, may be helpful for the assessment of contributory factors of AR.",

As an indicator, we used muscle tissue of the chub ( Leuciscus cephalus ) caught at selected sites in 2007. A total of 96 fish were examined. Total mercury was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry using the AMA 254 analyzer and methylmercury was determined by gas chromatography with electron-capture detection. Total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations ranged 0.039–0.384 mg kg -1 fresh weight and 0.033–0.362 mg kg -1 fresh weight, respectively. Mercury bound in methylmercury (HgMe) made up on average about 82.2% of total mercury. The highest mercury concentrations were found in fish from Obříství, a site on Labe (THg 0.263 ± 0.086 mg kg -1 ; MeHg 0.256 ± 0.084 mg kg -1 ). Mercury concentrations in fish from rivers that cross the borders of the Czech Republic (Labe, Odra and Morava) were low. The Czech Republic therefore does not contribute significantly to river pollution outside its national borders. Hazard indices of the sites monitored were well below 1, and reached 1.365 only in Obříství on Labe for fisherman’s family members (i.e. in the case of annual consumption of 10 kg fish). This indicates possible hazards involved in eating meat of fish caught in that location. Based on PTWI for methylmercury, the maximum amount of fish meat allowed for consumption per week was calculated. The site with the lowest value was Obříství on Labe (0.44 kg). The results of this study present a partial contribution to health risk assessment on the major rivers in Czech Republic.",

Each group was divided into 4 subgroups. Exposure of layer hens to 31 ± 3 °C and 33 ± 0 °C ambient temperature and 84.6% and 81.5% relative humidity during the experiment caused an increase in the value of temperature humidity index of 15.5 above the threshold value of 70 established for this species.

Similarly, heterophil/lymphocyte ratios of 0.51, 0.52, and 0.50 for groups with diet supplemented with vitamin C, vitamin E and vitamins C + E, respectively, were significantly ( p &lt; 0.001) lower compared to 0.59 recorded in the control group. However, heterophil, basophil and monocyte values were significantly ( p &lt; 0.001) higher in the control group compared to all treated groups. The results of the present study showed that dietary supplementation of vitamins C and E, or their combination, reduces the harmful effect of high ambient temperature and humidity on the leukocyte indicators of exposed layer hens, thereby alleviating the stress imposed on their thermoregulatory mechanism and physiological status.",

Earthworms from grass fields with a specific activity of 16 Bq kg -1 , rootlets from the Šabrava location with 200 Bq kg -1 and Elaphomyces granulatus fruiting bodies with 4,743 Bq kg -1 and 2,858 Bq kg -1 are the components of boar food with the 137 Cs specific activities higher than that of the detection limit. Consequently, underground mushrooms probably represent the main source of radiocesium in the food chain of boars. A remarkable reduction of 137 Cs specific activities in boar muscles is not expected at the post-Chernobyl radiocesium contaminated locations with the occurrence of Elaphomyces granulatus within next two decades.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the effects of two levels of clinoptilolite administered in feed (2% and 4%) on some selected performance indicators, metabolic utilization of basic nutrients and the health status of laying hens. The selected 24 Bovans Goldline hybrid laying hens were divided into three equal groups, two experimental groups (E1 and E2) and one control group (C). The laying hens were housed individually in cages with an automatic supply of drinking water, manual feeding, in a setting with controlled light and temperature regimens. Hens from individual groups were all fed a complete feed mix of the same composition and the only difference was in clinoptilolite supplementation: feed mixes for E1 and E2 groups contained 2% and 4% of clinoptilolite (commercial additive ZeoFeed) respectively, replacing the same amounts of wheat. The hens received feed mixes and drinking water ad libitum . During this 28-day experiment, feed consumption and the number and weight of eggs laid were monitored individually for each hen. At the end of the experiment, the balance test using the indicator method (Cr 2 O 3 ) was performed in all eight hens in each of the groups. The results of balance tests were then used to calculate the metabolic utilization of selected nutrients (nitrogen, fat, ash, nitrogen-free extracts, starch, gross energy, Ca, P). After the balance tests, blood samples for haematological and biochemical examinations were collected via puncture of the vena basilica. The addition of 2% clinoptilolite to feed mix resulted in a highly significant ( P ⪬ 0.01) increase in mean egg weight to 64.69 g, but the addition of 4% clinoptilolite in group E2 resulted in a highly significant ( P ⪬ 0.01) decrease in mean egg weight to 62.20 g compared to the control (63.73 g). Moreover, daily feed mix consumption in group E1 decreased to 114 g per one laying hen/day compared to the controls (118 g per one laying hen/day). In group E2 (4% clinoptilolite), daily consumption of feed mix increased compared with the controls to 124 g. The 2% clinoptilolite supplementation of E1 group feed slightly increased metabolic utilization of fat, nitrogen-free extracts, starch and gross energy compared to group C. Results of haematological test of the hens’ blood showed significant changes in haemoglobin, whose values in groups C and E1 were significantly higher ( P ⪬ 0.05) than in group E2. Differences in the values of the biochemical indicators monitored (total protein, glucose, cholesterol, triacylglycerols, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and the AST enzyme) between group C and experimental groups E1 and E2 were not significant and remained within the range of reference values.",

    "abstract": "The main objective of this experimental study was to determine how diets containing lupin meal affect the performance indicators, carcass value, and chemical composition of breast and thigh muscles in broiler chickens. The diets tested in experimental groups E1 and E2 differed as follows: in group E1, one third of nitrogen-containing substances (NSs) from extracted soybean meal was replaced with NSs from lupin meal; in group E2, two thirds were replaced compared to the control group. The replacement of soybean meal with lupin meal in experimental diets failed to produce any significant effect on the average live weight of chickens on Day 42 of the fattening period compared to the control group. The replacement of soybean meal with lupin meal resulted in decreased average weight of carcass and breast muscles and in decreased yield of breast muscles. Differences between the control group (C) and group E2 were significant ( P &amp;#x2AAC 0.01). Chickens in group E2 also showed a significant increase ( P &amp;#x2AAC 0.01) in the yield of the heart and stomach compared to the control group. The differences in weight and yield of thigh muscles between the control group and the experimental groups (E1 and E2) were not significantly affected. As far as chemical composition is concerned, chickens receiving the lupin-containing feed showed a significant ( P &amp;#x2AAC 0.01) increase in the ash content in breast muscles. On the contrary, in thigh muscles in group E2, the ash content decreased significantly ( P &amp;#x2AAC 0.01). The content of calcium showed an increasing trend in both breast and thigh muscles in both experimental groups. In contrast, the content of magnesium in chicken muscles in both experimental groups decreased. These differences were significant ( P &amp;#x2AAC 0.01) only in thigh muscles. Our results show that lupin seed is a suitable substitute for NSs contained in soybean extracted meal. It is considered optimal to replace up to one third of NSs contained in soybean meal with lupin seed. Higher inclusion rate of lupin meal in diets may reduce the growth intensity of chickens, particularly the yield of breast muscles. Due to substantial inter-varietal differences, it is necessary to optimize individual nutrients, particularly amino acids when formulating lupin-containing diets.",

Anti-inflammatory effect was studied using acute rat model (carrageenan-induced rat paw oedema) in which aspirin at 150 mg·kg -1 , indomethacin at 10 mg·kg -1 (both are standard anti-inflammatory drugs) and aqueous extract of Jatropha curcas leaves at 150 mg·kg -1 were administered orally to 24 Wistar rats 1 h before induction of oedema and compared with a negative control given 10 ml·kg -1 saline. Using the same dose of the plant extract, the analgesic effect of the aqueous extract of Jatropha curcas leaves was also investigated by measuring the number of acetic acid-induced writhing in 18 mice. The mean percentage inhibition of paw volume of rats treated with indomethacin was 83.9% followed by aspirin treated group with 64.3%, and the Jatropha curcas treated group with 60.7%. The mean number of writhing was significantly lower ( P &lt; 0.05) in mice given aqueous extract of Jatropha curcas leaves (34.0) compared to the control group (55.8) but higher than that of the standard analgesic, paracetamol (23.5).

Four consecutive amitraz fumigations produced a 93.82% reduction on average in final mite numbers and thus ensure normal colony development and overwintering.

Blood for the measuring of indicators of metabolism was sampled in weeks 1 and 2 ante partum and in weeks 1, 2, 3, 7 and 15 post partum . Retained placenta was reported in 11 cows, and ketosis was diagnosed in 18 animals. One week ante partum , the serum profile of cows diagnosed with ketosis during lactation revealed 0.52 mmol/l β-hydroxybutyric acid and 0.29 mmol/l non-esterified fatty acids on average. One week post partum , the serum profile of cows with ketosis revealed 1.59 mmol/l β-hydroxybutyric acid and 1.09 mmol/l non-esterified fatty acids and cows with retained placenta 1.65 and 1.41, respectively. From the week 5 ante partum to the point of lowest body condition the average body condition loss reached 1.4 points in cows with retained placenta, 1.1 points in cows with ketosis, and 0.8 points in healthy cows. Retained placenta and ketosis increased significantly conception rates by 0.47 and 0.50, respectively. Our results show that monitoring changes in the body condition and non-esterified fatty acids and β-hydroxybutyric acid blood levels in high-yielding cows in the transition period, followed by taking relevant disease-control measures, may be effective in reducing the incidence of retained placenta and ketosis in dairy cattle herds.",

Moreover, higher concentrations of M-SAA were found also in samples from mammary quarters without clinical changes and positive CMT. The analyses of Hp and SAA concentrations showed a trend of higher values in cows with clinical mastitis. The lowest mean concentration of albumin we found in cows with clinical signs of mastitis. Our results indicate elevated production of M-SAA in cows with clinical changes on mammary gland, and suggest the usefulness of this indicator also in the diagnosing of sub-clinical mastitis.",

In the second experiment, the effects of different concentrations of lactic acid on base-buffering capacity, buffer value index and indicators of fermentation process were studied in two groups of corn silages (n = 21). Two groups of analyzed values were compared using unpaired t -test. Differences among the groups in base-buffering capacity ( P &lt; 0.001) and buffer value index ( P &lt; 0.01) were significant. In the third experiment, rumen fluid pH was measured using 8 total mixed rations on 48 lactating dairy cows. In the present study no significant ( P &gt; 0.05) correlation was found between ruminal pH and dietary buffer value index. These results confirmed that dietary acid-base status alone is not adequate as a predictor of the need for buffers in the diet of lactating cows. It is the first report about using of buffering capacity determination methods for evaluation of feedstuffs and dietary acid-base status in dairy cows.",

Breast muscles in pheasants contained higher protein content on a dry matter basis (930.57 g·kg -1 in females, 937.23 g·kg -1 in males) and lower fat content (29.58 g·kg -1 in females, 29.92 g·kg -1 in males) as compared to thigh muscles (protein: 781.80 g·kg -1 in females, 810.07 g·kg -1 in males, fat: 163.74 g·kg -1 in females, 140.71 g·kg -1 in males). Breast muscles in both females and males contained less calcium (0.67 g·kg -1 in females, 0.57 g·kg -1 in males) and more phosphorus (10.16 g·kg -1 in females, 9.72 g·kg -1 in males) compared to the thigh muscles in which the mean calcium content was 1.28 g·kg -1 in females and 1.32 g·kg -1 in males, and the mean phosphorus content was 9.31 g·kg -1 in females and 9.23 g·kg -1 in males. Breast and thigh muscles in both female and male pheasants contained higher protein content and lower fat content compared to broiler meat. The calcium content in pheasant meat was lower whereas the phosphorus and magnesium contents were higher compared to broiler meat. Pheasant meat with high content of protein and low fat content is very valuable foodstuff and its dietetic value exceeds that of broiler meat. There is a lack of scientific literature on this subject which has not been studied in detail yet. This study extends the current scope of scientific knowledge in this field.",

Forty eight one- to two-year-old fish were divided into two groups, i.e. 24 fish were treated with 13.0 mg·l -1 of Gardoprim Plus Gold 500 SC and 24 fish were used in control. The experiment was conducted according to OECD method No. 203 Fish, Acute Toxicity Test. Experimental carp showed a significant decrease in leukocyte and lymphocyte counts ( P &lt; 0.01) and haematocrit value ( P &lt; 0.05) in haematological profile. In biochemical indices, a significant increase in glucose, aspartate aminotransferase, ammonia ( P &lt; 0.01), and lactate dehydrogenase ( P &lt; 0.05) and a significant decrease in inorganic phosphorus, triglycerides ( P &lt; 0.01), and chlorides ( P &lt; 0.05) were found in exposed carp compared to control. Histopathological examination revealed lesions in gills and liver. The decline in both leukocyte and lymphocyte counts indicates decreased nonspecific immunity of treated common carp. Increase in ammonia and glucose concentrations, and in catalytic activities of lactate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase can be related to stress burden, and alteration of liver cell function, respectively, in experimental carp compared to control fish. The study uniquely contributes to the evaluation of the effect of two-component herbicide preparation on common carp.",

Strains identified as Staphylococcus aureus were further analysed by the polymerase chain reaction method for detection of the mec A gene and for confirmation of the sequence type 398. Positive incidence of Staphylococcus aureus was confirmed in farms of suckler cows, sheep, goats and pigs. The incidence of methicilin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was confirmed at a goat farm, with all strains belonging to the sequence type 398. Repetitive element palindromic-polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed to compare the relatedness of selected human and animal S. aureus strains at the goat and sheep farms. The obtained data from repetitive element-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed significant clonal similarity among the tested isolates and indicated the possibility of mutual transmission between animals or animal and human and possible transfer in the food chain.",

Applying the established assays, we investigated the distribution of antibiotic resistance genes in the above mentioned species isolated from milk samples in the Czech Republic. Each assay consisted of seven pairs of primers. Six of them amplified fragments of antibiotic resistance genes and one pair a fragment of a species specific gene. Polymerase chain reaction conditions were optimized to amplify seven gene fragments simultaneously in one reaction. In total, 249 isolates were used, among which 111 were positive for E. coli , 52 for S. aureus and 86 for Streptococcus spp. The majority (60.2%) of bacteria carried at least one antibiotic resistance gene and 44.6% were multidrug-resistant.

In this work, identification and classification of E. coli isolates obtained from lambs and goat kids with diarrhoea were studied along with antibiotic resistance and clonal relationships of enterovirulent strains. A total of 107 E. coli strains isolated from animals on 43 farms were investigated. Specific virulence genes were determined by multiplex and uniplex polymerase chain reaction. Testing of antibiotic susceptibility was carried out by the Vitek II compact system. The relationship of E. coli isolates was determined by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus polymerase chain reaction. A total of 39 (36.4%) enterovirulent E. coli strains were identified and of this 19 (48.7%) were shiga toxigenic, 12 (30.8%) enterotoxigenic and 8 (20.5%) enteropathogenic. Three isolates (7.7%) were found to be positive for extended spectrum beta lactamase; 10 (25.6%) isolates showed multi-drug resistance to antimicrobials. A total of 28 types were detected by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus polymerase chain reaction. Twenty strains had distinct types while 5 types were common for 2 strains and 3 types were common for 3 strains. This is the first current determination of types, clonality and antibiotic resistance of enterovirulent E. coli isolated from small ruminants with diarrhoea. The results of this study showed that the rates of shiga toxigenic, enterotoxigenic and enteropathogenic isolates of E. coli are high in the western part of Turkey. Although these isolates were not clonal, presence of multidrug resistant isolates may cause public health problems.",

    "abstract": "The experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of feeding a diet supplemented with different forms of selenium on the rumen fluid, blood and serum enzyme activity and osmotic fragility of red blood cells in sheep. The experiment was carried out on 18 sheep of the Valashka breed at the age of 18 months, divided into 3 groups. The first group was given basal diet (BD) with a Se content of 0.17 mg/kg of dry matter (DM). The second group received BD supplemented with 0.4 mg Se/kg of (DM) in the form of sodium selenite. The third group received BD supplemented with 0.4 mg Se/kg of (DM) in the form of Se-yeast extract. Duration of the trial was 12 weeks. Selenium concentration in blood and total rumen fluid were elevated in both supplemented groups with the highest values in Se-yeast-treated sheep. Blood glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity was significantly increased, regardless of the source of selenium. Osmotic resistance of red blood cells was not affected by selenium supplementation. The results indicate that feeding a diet supplemented with selenium from Se-yeast or selenite improved selenium status in blood and total rumen fluid. Selenium from sodium selenite was as effective as selenium from Se-yeast in the availability of selenium for the blood GPx activity. The effect of selenium supplementation on the ruminal enzyme activity depends on the selenium form; GGT and GDH were significantly higher in the Se-yeast supplement group, AST and ALP were significantly higher in the selenite supplement group.",

The performance indicators and lipid peroxidation by measuring the contents of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in tissues and plasma were also evaluated. Broilers were assigned to 4 treatment groups, each replicated × 6, with 9 birds per replicate. The control group was fed conventional basal diet (BD); the three other groups received identical BD supplemented with 120 mg Zn/kg in the form of zinc sulphate, zinc chelate of glycine hydrate (Zn-Gly), and zinc proteinate (Zn-Pro), respectively. After 5 weeks of dietary treatment, feed supplementation with Zn sulphate resulted in significantly higher average daily weight gain and final body weight, as well as improved feed conversion ratio compared to the Zn-Gly group. Intake of Zn-Pro significantly increased SOD activity ( P &lt; 0.05) in erythrocytes and lipid peroxidation ( P &lt; 0.01) in plasma. Activities of total SOD and Cu/Zn SOD in liver and kidney were not affected by Zn supplementation. Addition of Zn supplements to broiler diets did not influence concentrations of zinc, manganese and copper in plasma, liver, kidney or breast muscle, with the exception of Zn deposition in the liver being significantly higher ( P &lt; 0.05) in the Zn-Pro supplemented group. Results of our study show that organic zinc sources have effects comparable to inorganic zinc sulphate in broilers fed diets containing a higher Zn content.",

    "abstract": "Tissue engineering promotes tissue regeneration through biomaterials that have excellent properties and have the potential to replace tissues. Many studies show that bacterial cellulose (BC) might ensure tissue regeneration and substitution, being used for the bioengineering of hard, cartilaginous and soft tissues. Bacterial cellulose is extensively used as wound dressing material and results show that BC is a promising tissue scaffold (bone, cardiovascular, urinary tissue). It can be combined with polymeric and non-polymeric compounds to acquire antimicrobial, cell-adhesion and proliferation properties. To ensure proper tissue regeneration, the material has to be: biocompatible, with minimum tissue reaction and biodegradability; bio-absorbable, to promote tissue development, cellular interaction and grow; resistant to support the weight of the newly formed tissue. Its versatile structure, physical and biochemical properties can be adjusted by adapting the bacteria culturing conditions. The main biomedical applications seem to be as hard (bone, dental), fibrocartilaginous (meniscal) and soft tissue (skin, cardiovascular, urinary) substituents. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge, challenges and future applications of BC and its biomedical potential in veterinary medicine. It was focused on the main uses in regeneration and scaffold tissue replacement and, although BC showed promising results, there is a lack of successful results of BC use in clinical practice. Most studies were performed only at experimental level and further research is needed for BC to enter clinical veterinary practice.",

    "abstract": "Animal welfare during the transport of fattened cattle has a significant effect on the likelihood of mortality or poor meat quality. The number of animals that died during transport to a slaughterhouse or briefly after being delivered to a slaughterhouse may serve as an indicator of animal welfare during transport. The aim of this study was to determine the mortality in fattened cattle resulting from transport to a slaughterhouse, and to examine the effect of both travel distance and the season of the year on the mortality rate in fattened cattle during transport. The mortality rate in fattened cattle during transport to a slaughterhouse that were monitored in the Czech Republic in the period of 1997 - 2004 was 0.007% ± 0.003%. However, it varied significantly ( p &lt; 0.05, r = 0.90) with the travel distance to a slaughterhouse, ranging from 0.004% ± 0.002% at a travel distance up to 50 km to 0.024% ± 0.027% at a travel distance over 300 km. The season of the year also had a significant impact on the mortality rate in transported fattened cattle. In general, the highest mortality rate was observed in summer months (particularly in July and August) and winter months (particularly in January and February). Correlation (r = 0.68) was proved ( p &lt; 0.01) between the mortality rate in fattened cattle and ambient temperature. The results indicate relatively low sensitivity of fattened cattle to stress during transport, which was reflected in transport-induced mortality. The increasing travel distance and the transport of cattle in summer or winter months resulted in an increase in transport-induced mortality rates.",

Also the use of live vaccines is well established in the control of the disease. Three groups of live vaccines can be distinguished based on the characteristics of the Eimeria species included in the product: vaccines based on live virulent strains, vaccines based on live attenuated strains, vaccines based on live strains that are relatively tolerant to the ionophores, and non-live subunit vaccines. The mounting problem of drug resitance of Eimeria species has prompted major research efforts to seek alternative means of control through increased knowledge of understanding the immunomodulation, natural-product feed additives, advances in live and recombinant vaccines. This article reviews the above mentioned methods in control of chicken coccidiosis.",

For this purpose, blood samples were taken from fish on days 1, 7 and 14 of exposure. Potential killing activity was determined by measuring oxidative radical production and phagocytic activity of neutrophils and superoxide anion production of phagocytic cells against Y. ruckeri . The activity of phagocytic cells in fish exposed to each of three concentrations was found higher than that in controls and the differences were statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.01). Although no activation in oxidative radical production, phagocytes and bactericidal killing activity in fish exposed to 5 and 10 μg ml -1 concentration of levamisole solution was determined on day 7, it was observed that all indicators increased on day 14 of exposure. The present results suggest that the application of levamisole in fish farms could increase non-specific immunity and resistance to infection of fish and offer economics benefits.",

The SCC was assessed quantitatively by FOSSOMATIC 90 analyser; serum and milk Hp and SAA concentrations were determined using commercial ELISA kits (Tridelta Development, Ltd., Wicklow, Ireland). We have found a significantly higher Hp and SAA concentrations in the group with SCC &gt; 400,000 cells/ml compared to groups with lower SCC thresholds in composite milk samples. In contrast, significant differences were not demonstrated between the groups in Hp and SAA concentrations determined in serum. The concentrations of Hp in serum and milk were found to be correlated (r = 0.69, P = 0.0003), whereas there was a lower correlation trend in the case of serum versus milk concentrations of SAA (r = 0.43, P = 0.0478). High significant correlations were observed either between milk haptoglobin values and SCC or milk serum amyloid A concentrations and SCC (r = 0.83, r = 0.81, P &lt; 0.0001; respectively). An increase in SCC in cows suffering from mastitis has been accompanied by strong elevation of the milk Hp and SAA, significantly correlated with serum Hp (r = 0.64, P = 0.0014) and poorly correlated with SAA values determined in serum (r = 0.43, P = 0.0478). According to the results obtained in this study we can conclude that measurements of the acute phase proteins, haptoglobin and serum amyloid A predominantly in milk, may be a useful tool in diagnosing mastitis and may be a useful marker of milk quality.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this experiment was to monitor the possibility of influencing the composition of milk and milk products by supplementing the feed of lactating goats with selenium in various forms (natrium selenite, selenium proteinate). The trial was carried out in 30 goats, divided into 3 groups: Group C (n = 10) was a control group, SeI group (n = 10) received selenium in the form of natrium selenite and SeO group (n = 10) in the form of lactate-protein complex produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus . Diverse selenium supplementations were carried out from 3.5–4 months before the date of delivery until the 2nd month of lactation. In the time span of 2 weeks, milk from individual goats was taken six times and cheeses and yoghurts were made from the mixed milk from individual groups. During the period of milking and making milk products, the goats in experimental groups received added 565 μg Se per animal and day in relevant forms. Long-term selenium supplementation in the form of natrium selenite/proteinate had no significant effect on the Se concentration in milk. Se concentration in milk of individual groups was as follows: C: 13.14 ± 4.21 μg l -1 , SeI: 12.50 ± 5.59 μg l -1 , SeO: 12.47 ± 3.71 μg l -1 . Similarly, no significant differences in the selenium concentration were determined in yoghurts (C: 17.13 ± 5.40 μg kg -1 , SeI: 18.12 ± 5.49 μg kg -1 , SeO: 19.69 ± 6.48 μg kg -1 ) and cheeses (C: 68.79 ± 7.14 μg kg -1 , SeI: 70.41 ± 6.22 μg kg -1 , SeO: 69.66 ± 12.68 μg kg -1 ) made from milk of individual goats groups. Apart from selenium concentration in milk and milk products, we also monitored other quality indicators that might have been influenced by selenium supplementation in the goats' feed. Among qualitative milk indicators, we found significantly lower titration acidity and significantly higher rennetability in SeI group. We also determined a significantly higher fat concentration in milk of SeO group compared to the other two groups. Indicators monitored during production of yoghurts and cheeses were not influenced significantly, only fat concentration in yoghurts was higher in SeO group compared to SeI group.

The exposure of fish to propylparaben did not affect vitellogenesis after 20 days exposure but seemed to influence the sex differentiation processes, as evidenced by a sex ratio significantly skewed towards females in the group fed 500 mg kg -1 of propylparaben following 45 days of exposure. The potential of the fish to respond to oestrogenic stimulation was confirmed, since significantly higher vitellogenin concentrations were detected in the fish from the positive control group.",

Laying hens were divided into three groups (C, E 1 and E 2 ) with 120 hens in each group and kept in 24 cages. Hens were fed layer diets containing 18% of crude protein and 11.60 MJ ME. Hens in the control group C were fed diets that contained 0.2 mg/kg of inorganic selenium (sodium selenite). Experimental groups E 1 and E 2 were given diets with increased concentrations of selenium as follows: E 1 = 0.4 mg/kg of selenium (sodium selenite), E 2 = 0.4 mg/kg of organic selenium (Sel-Plex). Selenium concentration in diets affected significantly the content of selenium in albumen ( P &lt; 0.001) and yolk ( P &lt; 0.05). The highest concentration of selenium was determined in albumen and yolk of eggs produced in group E 2 (345 ng/g and 783 ng/g, respectively), then in eggs of group E 1 (230 ng/g and 757 ng/g, respectively), and group C had the lowest concentration of selenium in albumen and yolk (181 ng/g and 573 ng/g, respectively). After 28 days of storage at 4 °C, the eggs containing organic selenium had more freshness (VN: C = 32.9, E 1 = 2.60, E 2 = 2.11). It was concluded that higher concentration of organic selenium in eggs was a limiting factor in metabolic processes, which positively affected the indicators of egg freshness.",

Samples were stored for 7 weeks at 5 °C and 20 °C. BAs were studied as dansyl derivatives by the RP-HPLC method with fluorescence detection, histamine was determined using a photodiode array detector. Physical and chemical properties were analyzed as specified by the Czech National Standard, as were the sensory characteristics (colour, odour, texture and flavour). The major amines found were cadaverine (124–2413 mg kg -1 ) and tyramine (117–1058 mg kg -1 ), followed by putrescine (75–767 mg kg -1 ) and histamine (74–411 mg kg -1 ). Low concentrations of tryptamine, spermine and spermidine were present. Total concentrations of BAs significantly increased with storage time ( P &lt; 0.01), depending significantly on temperature ( P &lt; 0.01). Total BAs in cheese stored at 20 °C compared to 5 °C were more than three times higher, reaching 4600 mg kg -1 at the end of storage. The toxicologically critical value of 900 mg kg -1 for the sum of histamine + tyramine + putrescine + cadaverine was reached 17 days later in the cheese stored at 5 °C compared to 20 °C. When stored at 5 °C, the samples retained adequate sensory characteristics for the entire safe storage time. The effects of storage conditions on BAs formation are relevant to reducing the risk associated with consumption of cheese high in BAs.",

On day 3 of the oestrous cycle, 50 ml of saline or 50 ml of Escherichia coli suspension, containing 10 9 colony-forming units/ml, was injected into each uterine horn in the control or experimental group, respectively. Seven days later the uteri were collected. Endometritis developed in all bacteria-inoculated gilts. Endometrium/myometrium and myometrium strips were incubated with PGE 2 alone or together with PGE 2 receptor (EP) subtypes (EP 2 , EP 4 , EP 1 and EP 3 ) blockers: AH 6809 (BEP 2 ), ONO-AE 2 (BEP 4 ), ONO-AE 3 -240 (BEP 1 ) and SC19220 (BEP 3 ), respectively. In the control group, PGE 2 (10 -8 and 10 -7 M) increased the intensity of contractions in endometrium/myometrium, and at the higher dose in myometrium. PGE 2 (10 -8 M) decreased the contraction intensity of the strips from inflamed uteri. After the use of BEP 2 , PGE 2 (10 -7 M) increased the values of this indicator in endometrium/myometrium and myometrium from the control gilts. In these animals, PGE 2 (10 -8 M) in the presence of BEP 4 reduced the contraction intensity in endometrium/myometrium. In the bacterial group, PGE 2 (10 -8 M) in the presence of BEP 2 and BEP 4 enhanced the intensity of contractions in myometrium. Similar reaction was evoked by PGE 2 (10 -7 M) in endometrium/myometrium of the inflamed uteri in the presence of BEP 4 . The intensity of contractions in myometrium from the inflamed uteri significantly decreased after the use of BEP 1 and PGE 2 (10 -7 M). PGE 2 (10 -7 M) administered after BEP 3 , significantly decreased the intensity of contractions in myometrium of the control gilts. These results show that PGE 2 decreases the contraction intensity of inflamed porcine uteri. Further studies are needed to closely determine the role of PGE 2 and other prostanoids in the contractile activity of inflamed uterine tissue.",

Pathological signs of toxicity were investigated on days 21 and 39 of the trial, individual liveweight was measured weekly. Five birds from each group were sacrificed on the 21st and 39th days of treatment, when blood plasma, red blood cell, liver and kidney samples were taken, in which malondialdehyde and reduced glutathione concentration and glutathione-peroxidase activity were determined. Pathological signs (lesions in the oral cavity and on the tongue, inflammation in the small intestine) were found in the group fed T-2 and HT-2 toxin contaminated feed on day 21 compared to control. Body weight was significantly lower as a result of feeding T-2 and HT-2 toxin contaminated diet. However, the contamination did not cause a significant increase of malondialdehyde content in the analysed tissues. Reduced glutathione content was significantly lower in the liver homogenate on day 39 than that of the control. Glutathione peroxidase activity also did not differ significantly in blood plasma, red blood cell haemolysates and kidney homogenates, while it was significantly higher in the liver homogenates of the mycotoxin-challenged birds. In conclusion, it can be stated that T-2 and HT-2 toxin exposure has long-term effects in broiler chickens.",

Natural substances were administered for the first 21 days. The experiment lasted for 42 days. The antibacterial effect was determined by the decrease of coagulase-positive staphylococci in E1 compared to control at day 42. Staphylococcus aureus cells were detected in lower counts in E2 compared to control at day 21. The counts of Clostridium- like bacteria were lower in both experimental groups at day 21 compared to day 7 (difference 1.2 and 1.3 log cycles, respectively) and to control (difference 0.5 and 0.3 log cycles, respectively). At day 7, the counts of coliforms in E1 were significantly lower than in E2 ( P &lt; 0.01). In rabbits fed with oregano, reduction of Eimeria sp. oocysts and higher value of phagocytic activity (21.6 ± 0.51 %) were found compared to Xtract TM , and prolonged immuno-stimulatory effect was noted. In the animals of both experimental groups higher final weight, feed conversion ratio and lower mortality were achieved compared to control. The administration of oregano showed antibacterial, anticoccidial, and immunomodulatory effects.

It is suggested that colostral immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration varies between and within breeds and could also be affected by maternal factors. The aim of this study was to investigate possible effects of litter type and ewe parturition number on colostral IgG concentration in two Iranian fat-tailed breeds of sheep (Shaul and Lori Bakhtyari) as well as usefulness of different methods for estimation of IgG concentrations in colostrum. The colostral IgG concentrations were measured in 38 Shaul and 59 Lori Bakhtyari ewes by single radial immunodiffusion, zinc sulphate turbidity and Biuret methods. Measurement of IgG by single radial immunodiffusion revealed that Lori Bakhtyari ewes had significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) lower colostral IgG levels (48.82 ± 2.10 mg/ml) than Shaul ewes (62.86 ± 2.48). With regard to the effect of litter type and parturition number, a significant ( P &lt; 0.05) difference in IgG concentration of colostrum was only observed between the first (65.17 ± 5.74 mg/ml) and third parturition (41.10 ± 4.60 mg/ml) of Lori Bakhtyari ewes. The colostral IgG concentration was not associated with ewe serum IgG concentration ( P &gt; 0.05). The mortality rate was higher in lambs born to ewes with lower IgG in their colostrum. Single radial immunodiffusion did not correlate either with zinc sulphate turbidity method (r = -0.253, P &gt; 0.05) or with Biuret method (r = -0.005, P &gt; 0.05). We can conclude that concentration of colostral IgG could be influenced by breed but not by litter type and parturition number.",

Calorimetric analysis revealed significant ( P ≤ 0.05) and highly significant ( P ≤ 0.01) differences between individual species in the content of energy in breast and thigh muscles.

Highly significant ( P ≤ 0.01) differences in the energy content were also found between breast and thigh muscles in all studied game species except for wild turkey. Differences in the content of energy in muscles between individual species occur mainly due to different contents of fat in muscles. This is also confirmed by high correlation coefficients between the content of energy and the content of fat in breast (r = 0.912) and thigh muscles (r = 0.878).

The experiment involved 40 broilers fattened for 42 days. During the first three weeks, all broilers consumed starter diet containing 22% crude protein. After three weeks, broilers were divided into two groups and fed finisher diets containing 18% crude protein and supplemented with 3% sunflower oil and 3% linseed oil. Group 1 was not administered artificial selenium; Group 2 was supplemented with organic selenium at the amount of 0.5 mg Se/kg of feed. Significantly higher ( P &lt; 0.05) content of selenium was observed in the thigh muscle tissue of Group 2 compared to Group 1 (1.071 and 0.511 mg/kg of dry matter, respectively). The increase of selenium content in feed to 0.5 mg/kg resulted in an increase of total n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (from 5.27% to 6.25%), and in reduction of total monounsaturated fatty acids (from 39.60% to 36.74%) in the lipids of thigh muscle tissue. The increase in total n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids induced significant ( P &lt; 0.05) lowering of the n6/n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ratio (4.62 and 5.01 for the first and second group, respectively). The increase of selenium content in broiler feed led to a decrease of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances ( P &gt; 0.05) and increase of linolenic acid and total n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( P &lt; 0.05) in thigh muscle tissue of broilers.

The experimental material comprised 32 Wistar rats at around 3 weeks of age, with an initial body weight of 81 g. During a 28-day feeding trial, the rats were fed diets containing the seeds of three blue lupine cultivars, Baron, Zeus and Wersal, with different alkaloid concentrations (0.36, 0.41, 0.56 mg/kg, respectively). Diets containing the seeds of three blue lupine cultivars reduced the feed intake and significantly limited the growth rate of experimental rats, compared to the control group. Lupine alkaloids had no effect on the serum concentrations of glucose and total cholesterol in rats, whereas elevated triglyceride concentrations were noted in experimental groups, relative to the control group. Diets containing the seeds of blue lupine cultivars Zeus and Wersal induced changes in alanine transaminase activity. A histopathological analysis of the liver revealed parenchymatous degeneration, which was more advanced in rats fed diets with the seeds of blue lupine cultivars Zeus and Wersal than in the control group, and congestion of portal vessels, which was more severe in rats fed the seeds of blue lupine cultivars Baron and Zeus.",

Altogether, 81 queens were sampled from 27 rearing apiaries in 2006 and 72 queens from 24 apiaries in 2008. Queens were analysed for the presence of four viruses: acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), black queen cell virus (BQCV), sacbrood virus (SBV) and deformed wing virus (DWV) by using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In 2006, 12%, 9% and 1% prevalence was found for ABPV, DWV and SBV, respectively; BQCV was not detected. Two years later, DWV, BQCV, SBV and ABPV were detected in 58%, 24%, 11% and 10% bee queens, respectively. In 2006, fourteen out of twenty-seven apaiaries were virus free, whereas in 2008 only three out of twenty-four apiaries were virus free. This is the first evidence of virus infection occurring in newly mated queens from mating nuclei in rearing apiaries. The possible impacts of queen rearing technology and epidemiological influences on virus infection are discussed in this study.",

While toxicity of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and heavy metals for free-ranging birds has been shown in single exposures, the present study aims to evaluate oxidative stress, and liver and kidney damage caused by single and combined effects of diclofenac and lead in the Japanese quail. Forty Japanese quail ( Coturnix coturnix japonica ) were divided into equal groups of controls, diclofenac, Pb, and Pb+diclofenac exposures. The birds were exposed to the respective chemicals through insertion of lead shots (1.5 g) into the crop on day 0 of the experiment and/or administration of 5 mg/kg of diclofenac intramuscularly in two treatments on days 0 and 5. Groups in liver and kidney tissues of birds were then compared after 10 days using histopathology and biochemistry markers such as glutathione reductase (GR), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and lipid peroxidation measured as total thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS). The liver damage score gradient was Pb+diclofenac exposure group &gt; Pb exposure group &gt; diclofenac exposure group and hepatic TBARS values were significantly increased in the group of birds exposed to a combination of diclofenac and lead compared to the healthy control group. The study has shown that, apart from the reported nephrotoxicity of diclofenac, hepatic toxicity should also be considered. Avian clinicians should be cautious when selecting drugs for therapy of wild birds with unknown history of exposure to toxic substances.",

    "abstract": "The present study compared the quality characteristics of boar semen diluted with three extenders of different proposed preservation times (short-term, medium-term and long-term). A part of extended semen was used for artificial insemination on the farm (30 sows/extender), while the remaining part was stored for three days (16–18 °C). Stored and used semen was also laboratory assessed at insemination time, on days 1 and 2 after the collection (day 0). The long-term extender was used for a short time, within 2 days from semen collection, with the aim to investigate a possible advantage over the others regarding laboratory or farm fertility indicators at the beginning of the preservation time. Viability, motility, kinetic indicators, morphology and DNA fragmentation were estimated. The results showed reduced viability, higher values for most of the kinetics, and higher immotile spermatozoa from day 1 to day 2 in all extenders; however, the long-term extender was superior compared to the other two on both days. With regard to morphology and chromatin integrity, the percentage of abnormal and fragmented spermatozoa increased on day 2 compared to day 1 for all of the extenders. However, based on the farrowing rate and the number of piglets born alive after the application of conventional artificial insemination within 2 days from semen collection/dilution, it was found that the medium-term diluents were more effective. In conclusion, it seems that the in vivo fertilization process involves more factors than simply the quality of laboratory evaluated sperm indicators, warranting further research.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this research was to determine the effect of dietary selenium supplementation (organic and inorganic) on the biochemical indices and thyroid hormone concentration in the blood of heavily pregnant and lactating ewes. Research was conducted on 30 pregnant ewes of the Merinolandschaf breed divided into 3 groups, and lasted for four months (two months on ewes in late pregnancy and two months on ewes during lactation). The first group was given a basal diet without the addition of selenium. The feed mixture of group 2 was supplemented with 0.3 mg/kg of organic sources of selenium, and group 3 with the same amount of inorganic sources of selenium. In lactating ewes, organic and inorganic selenium lead to a significant ( P &lt; 0.05; P &lt; 0.01) increase in urea concentration. At the same time, in lactating ewes inorganic selenium had a significant decreasing effect ( P &lt; 0.05; P &lt; 0.01) on cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and triglycerides. Organic selenium in heavily pregnant ewes significantly ( P &lt; 0.01) increased aspartate aminotransferase activity in comparison to group 1 and 3. In lactating ewes significant ( P &lt; 0.05) differences in aspartate aminotransferase activity were determined between groups 2 and 3. With selenium supplementation a significant ( P &lt; 0.01; P &lt; 0.05) increase concentration of Se was determined (for heavily pregnant and lactating ewes, respectively), as well as Na, Cl, Fe (lactating ewes), and a decrease of K (high pregnant ewes). Organic selenium had an effect on the increase of triiodothyronine in lactating ewes. We can conclude that selenium supplementation contributes to good health and condition of ewes in the demanding period of lactation.",

The aim of any packaging system for fresh flesh foods is to prevent or delay undesirable changes to the appearance, flavour, odour, and texture. Moreover, microbial contamination, together with lipid and protein oxidation, are major concerns for meat and products thereof in terms of food safety. Modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) is widely applied in the packaging of both meat and fish. This packaging technology extends shelf life and improves appearance; however, several variables must be considered, such as temperature control and differences in gas compositions in combination with different types of meat. This review provides an overview of the available information on packaging technologies, from the perspectives of their characteristics, application types, and effects on the shelf life of poultry, meat, and fish. Special attention is paid to the MAP and active packaging.",

    "abstract": "Battery cage systems for housing laying hens are being replaced by alternative systems including the deep litter system. At the same time, the substitution of meat and bone meal by vegetable matter in poultry feed mixtures is sought in the nutrition of laying hens. In the experiment, we compared the performance of laying hens of the ISA BROWN hybrid in both the cage system and the deep litter system, on a diet with the meat and bone meal content replaced by vegetable feeds (based on lupin). In the first group, 36 laying hens were kept in the deep litter system; in the second group, 36 laying hens were kept in cages. Over the period of nine months, the number of eggs laid, their weight, shell quality, the clinical state of the laying hens and incidence of their mortality were monitored daily. We found that in the cage system a higher number of eggs was obtained; a lower mean egg weight ( p &lt; 0.01); a higher number of eggs per hen per day ( p &lt; 0.01); a higher egg mass weight per hen per day ( p &lt; 0.01). There was a higher number of cracked eggs of the total number of eggs laid ( p &lt; 0.01), the number of membranous eggs of the total number of eggs laid did not differ ( p &gt; 0.05), and the number of laying hens which died was lower ( p &lt; 0.05) in comparison with the deep litter system. The results of the experiment demonstrate that, with the substitution of meat and bone meal by vegetable matter in the feed mixtures for laying hens, there are differences between the performance of laying hens from the deep litter system as compared to the laying hens from the cage system. The deep litter system better meets the requirements for the welfare of laying hens; however, it provides a lower yield.",

Two model experiments were carried out. In the first experiment, raw milk samples were frozen and stored at -20 °C for 72 hours, 7 days or 21 days. After thawing, the following counts of indicator microorganisms were assessed: total bacteria count and counts of coliform and psychrotrophic microorganisms. The counts of these microorganisms determined before freezing served as control. In the second experiment, milk samples were inoculated with strains of shigatoxigenic Escherichia coli , enterotoxigenic Staphylococcus aureus and bacteria Listeria monocytogenes and frozen. After storage for the above times, recovery was performed and colony-forming unit counts per millilitre were assessed. It was documented that freezing had a considerable adverse effect on the recovery of shigatoxigenic E. coli ( P &lt; 0.01) after 7 days of storage. A decline in counts of coliform bacteria ( P &lt; 0.01) and psychrotrophic microorganisms ( P &lt; 0.01) was detected as soon as after 72 hours storage. The decline in counts of E. coli and psychrotrophic microorganisms continued with the time of storage - 72 hours and 7 days ( P &lt; 0.05); 72 hours and 21 days ( P &lt; 0.01). In contrast, no effect was recorded for L. monocytogenes and total bacterial count. Freezing caused a slight increase ( P &lt; 0.05) in S. aureus counts in milk samples after 72 hours and 7 days of storage. The results of this study indicate that the freezing of milk samples is unsuitable for sample storage before the assessment of hygienic quality because potential risk of misdiagnosis may be high.",

Melatonin (MEL, 4 μg/ml of tap water) was administered daily since the 5th week of age. The control group drank tap water. Rats were fed a standard type of diet ad libitum and were kept in the light regimen L:D - 12:12 h. The experiment was terminated after 11 (variant B) or 12 (variant A) weeks of MEL administration. The animals were sacrificed by quick decapitation following overnight fasting (variant A) or 48-h fasting (variant B). Selected organs and tissues were removed and weighed and selected metabolic variables in the serum and tissues were determined. MEL decreased body mass independent of food and water intake in both sexes. In males (variant A) MEL increased the weight of the heart muscle, spleen and adrenals; it decreased the absolute weight of epididymal fat and increased serum corticosterone and phospholipids concentration in comparison with controls. In females, serum glucose decrease and liver triacylglycerols increase were found. After 48-h fasting (variant B) liver, spleen and adrenal weight increase in MELdrinking females was found. In males MEL increased the thymus weight and decreased the epididymal fat weight. In both sexes MEL increased serum corticosterone and liver glycogen concentration; MEL increased serum glucose in males and serum cholesterol concentration in females. Changes in the evaluated variables were also related to fasting duration prior to decapitation. A 48-h fasting at the end of the prolonged MEL intake (variant B vs. A) decreased the absolute liver weight in both sexes and the epididymal/periovarial fat weight, and increased thymus weight in males. In females it decreased the absolute heart muscle weight and increased the spleen weight. In males, 48-h fasting increased serum corticosterone and phospholipids concentration; it decreased the liver triacylglycerols content in females and the liver cholesterol content in males and females. In both sexes 48-h fasting increased glucose concentration in the serum and glycogen concentration in the liver and heart muscle as well as triacylglycerols and cholesterol concentration in the serum, phospholipids concentration in the liver and bone marrow and decreased malondialdehyde concentration in the liver. Forty-eight hour fasting after prolonged MEL administration resulted in a wider range of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism alterations of young rats of both sexes.",

Broilers were suspended from shackles placed in an experimental processing line and other stress factors (e.g. preslaughter transport, crating and ambient disturbances) were eliminated in order to assess the stress response to shackling particularly. When compared with an unshackled control, both S2 and S5 groups exhibited a highly significant increase in heterophil counts and H/L ratio 20 h following shackling. When compared, the mean value of the H/L ratio of S2 and S5 chickens was higher due to the longer shackling period. The difference, however, was not statistically significant. In addition, S5 broilers exhibited a statistically significant elevation in the number of basophils in comparison with the control. When compared with the control, S2 broilers exhibited a significant decrease in haemoglobin level, a highly significant decrease in erythrocyte cell count and MCHC values due to shackling. Both S2 and S5 groups of broilers manifested a highly significant increase in MCV values and markedly depressed erythrocyte count and MCHC values in comparison with unshackled broilers. When S2 and S5 broilers were compared, none of the monitored haematological indices of the erythrocyte count manifested any significant changes due to the different periods of shackling. Results of our experiment proved that the preslaughter shackling induced considerable changes in haematological indices of both leukocyte and erythrocyte count in broilers and indicated a markedly increased level of stress effects. In conclusion, using a method that eliminates the stress associated with the shackling of live birds before electrical stunning should be considered as a better option as far as bird welfare is concerned.",

    "abstract": "Physeal cartilage is known to have poor self-repair capacity after injury. Evaluation of the ability of cultured mesenchymal stem cells to repair damaged physis is the topic of current research. In 10 immature New Zealand white rabbits autogenous mesenchymal stem cells were transplanted into a iatrogenic physeal defect in a lateral portion of the distal growth plate of the right femur. The same defect without stem cells transplantation in the left femoral distal physis served as a control. In our study, we used our own technique of implantation of MSCs with a newly modified gel scaffold (New Composite Hyaluronate/Collagen Type I/Fibrin Scaffold). The rabbits were euthanized 4 months after transplantation. Bone length discrepancy and valgus deformity were measured from femoral radiographs. Healing of the defect was investigated histologically. The ability of mesenchymal stem cells to survive and promote cartilage healing in the physeal defect was assessed by immunofluorescence. Average difference in femur length measured from surgery to euthanasia (4 months) was 0.61 ± 0.19 cm after preventive transplantation of MSCs in the right femur, but only 0.11 ± 0.07 cm in the left femur. Average angular (valgus) deformity of the right femur with MSCs preventively transplanted to iatrogenically damaged distal femoral physis was 1.2 ± 0.72 °. Valgus deformity in the left femur was 5.4 ± 2.5 °. Prophylactic transplantation of autogenous mesenchymal stem cells to iatrogenically damaged distal growth plate of the rabbit femur prevented a bone bridge formation and resulted in healing of the physeal defect with hyaline cartilage. Immunofluorescence examination showed that the chondrocytes newly formed in growth zone are the result of implanted MSCs differentiation. Femur growth in traumatized physis was maintained even after transplantation of autogenous MSCs. As compared with the opposite femur (with physeal defect but without transplanted MSCs), the bone showed no significant shortening or valgus deformity ( p = 0.018).",

Approximately 50 substances are needed for the normal functioning of the body, but part of these substances can not be synthesized or are synthesized in insufficient quantities for the perfect functioning of metabolic birds. Among these substances, which are called essential nutrients, are minerals. The minerals are divided into macro-minerals, which must be supplied in large quantities and micro-minerals, which are required in small quantities in the body. The micro-mineral, also known as trace minerals, act as components of protein structures or as co-factors, assisting in the amendment or alosterica modulation of the tertiary structure of enzymes, making them active or inactive. For many years, nutritionists have used as inorganic minerals (example: zinc sulfate, sodium selenite, copper sulfate and another). Minerals to meet the requirements of the birds. To achieve the gastrointestinal tract minerals must be solubilized initially for liberarem ions and be absorbed. However, being in the form ionic minerals can complexar with other components of the diet, hindering the absorption or, if fully complexed, making them unavailable to animals. In view of these uncertainties, the levels of minerals supplied in the diet are often higher than the minimum required for optimum performance, resulting in over-supply. Currently, there is a greater interest in being supplied mineral or organic sources kelatiranih of trace minerals, often described as proteinates.",

The analyses were performed in dairy cows of the Slovak spotted breed and its crossbreeds (n = 57). The cows were divided into 9 groups according to the evaluated part of reproduction cycle – from 4 weeks before parturition to 10 weeks after parturition. Significant differences were found in mean Hp and SAA concentrations during the monitored period ( P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively). Cows during the early postparturient period had significantly higher Hp and SAA concentrations compared to cows in later postparturient period ( P &lt; 0.05). Significant differences throughout the period under study was found also in means of total cholesterol ( P &lt; 0.01), triglycerides ( P &lt; 0.001), and non-esterified fatty acids ( P &lt; 0.001). Concentrations of Hp during this period were positively correlated with SAA (R = 0.919; P &lt; 0.001). Moreover, significant correlations were found between Hp and non-esterified fatty acids, Hp and β-hydroxybutyrate, as well as between SAA and non-esterified fatty acids. Our results indicate that the acute phase response occurs in cows around parturition, and suggest that there are relationships between mediators of immune response and several indices of energy metabolism. Our results also suggest that in cows with higher concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids, indicating a certain degree of lipid mobilisation, higher values of acute phase proteins may be found.",

    "abstract": "Nitrite is a natural component of the nitrogen cycle in the environment. Although it usually occurs in low concentrations, elevated concentrations caused by effluents or affected nitrification process can lead to serious health deterioration of fish. Two aquarium fish zebrafish ( Danio rerio) and guppy ( Poecilia reticulata) are recommended to use as model organisms in toxicity tests. However, their sensitivity to nitrite can differ. The aim of this study was to define acute toxicity of nitrite by the semistatic method according to OECD No. 203 (Fish, Acute toxicity test). The series of 4 acute toxicity tests was performed, with 10 fish of both species used for each concentration and for the control. The 96hLC50 NO 2 - value for D. rerio and P. reticulata was 242.55 ± 15.79 mg·l -1 and 30.2 ± 8.74 mg·l -1 , respectively. We have proved significant difference ( p &lt; 0.05) in sensitivity between D. rerio and P. reticulata. The results showed different sensitivities to nitrites in tested fish species, which could be related to species-specific branchial chloride uptake mechanism. This is the first study on this fish species.",

The aim of the study was to apply the Wood’s model to fit lactation curve of milk yield as well as fat, protein, dry matter, lactose, somatic cell count and urea in cows’ milk. This study was conducted on dairy cows of Montbéliard (n = 686) and Polish Holstein-Friesian (n = 933) breeds. We analyzed data on the above mentioned milk constituents in the samples collected between 1995 and 2007. Data from 5,034 lactations were collected. Type C1 of the curve typical for standard lactation was the most frequent when daily milk yield, lactose and urea were analyzed. However, curves of fat protein and dry matter were described as type C4. The Wood’s model showed the highest accuracy when milk yield and protein content were investigated; poor fitting was observed for fat content. The Wood’s model brought better accuracy for Polish Holstein-Friesian cows compared to Montbéliards. Precision of mathematical models fitting is R 2 (adjusted determination coefficient). The highest values of R 2 were noticed when lactation and protein curves were investigated. The lowest R 2 was determined for urea and somatic cell count.",

Twenty eight adult male Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups, 2 experimental groups exposed to magnetic field for 21 days and 2 control groups (sham exposed). The first exposed group was sacrificed at the end of the exposure period, and the second exposed group was kept for extra 48 days post exposure to assess the delayed effects of exposure. Significant decrease in the testes weights, sperm motility, sperm count, normal sperms and live sperms was detected in the exposed groups compared to control. Serum testosterone concentrations were significantly increased after 21 days of exposure, and then these changes were corrected after 48 days post exposure. Superoxide dismutase, catalase activities and α-tocopherol concentration were significantly decreased after 21 days of exposure, while the later became non-significant after 48 days post exposure. L-ascorbate concentration was significantly increased after 21 days of exposure, and returned to normal 48 days post exposure. Histopathological examination of the testis from the exposed rats showed a disruption in its architecture with an increase in Leydig cell number and activity, whereas 48 days post exposure, the testicular germ cell layers increased with presence of high apoptotic rates. In conclusion, prolonged exposure to 50 Hz, 1 Gauss MF is biologically toxic to the testicular functions with oxidative stress on spermatogenesis that subsequently may affect male fertility and his sexual efficiency.",

The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of adding prefermented cereal product containing a high amount of gamma-linolenic acid into the feed on broiler chickens’ performance, fatty acids profile and oxidative stability in chilled breast meat. Seventy eight COBB 500 one-day old broiler chicks were randomly divided into 2 treatment groups with three replications and fattened for 42 days. During the first 21 days, all broilers consumed the starter diet. After three weeks, broilers were fed the grower diet; controls were fed without the addition of prefermented cereal product; and the experimental group was supplemented with 3% of prefermented product. Higher final body weight (2 688 vs. 2 604 g) and feed conversion ratio were recorded in the experimental group ( P &gt; 0.05). The increased GLA content in the experimental diet (0.095 g·kg -1 ) resulted in a significant increase of GLA, dihomo-GLA and arachidonic acid in the lipids of breast muscle tissue ( P &lt; 0.05). Adding prefermented product to the feed also resulted in an increase in total n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), mainly eicosapentaenoic and docosapentaenoic acid in lipids of breast ( P &lt; 0.05). The experimental diet produced a significant decrease in the n-6/n-3 ratio (from 10.00 to 8.14). Storage of breast muscles with a higher PUFA in chilling conditions led to a decrease in oxidative stability when the values of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) increased ( P &lt; 0.05). This is a first study using prefermented cereal product for the fattening of broiler chickens.",

    "abstract": "Biogenic amines are aliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic alkalic substances with a biological impact on live organisms. They may cause serious problems to sensitive persons in combination with some medicaments or in case of higher intake. They are present in non-fermented food, usually coming from contaminating microflora, and especially in fermented food where biogenic amines might be produced by microbiota used for procedure. The genus Enterococcus spp. can occur in cheese because their resistance to pasteurizing temperatures is much higher compared to other mesophilic microorganisms. Previous studies have targeted the occurrence and problems of enterococci isolated from cow and sheep milk. The aim of this study was to detect decarboxylase activity of enterococci isolated from goat milk and cheese and to see how the particular temperatures involve decarboxylase activity using a rapid and inexpensive screening method. In this study, bacteria Enterococcus faecium, E. mundtii, E. durans were isolated from 9 samples of goat milk and cheeses. Colonies of bacteria were inoculated on diagnostic medium fortified with amino acids (lysine, arginine, phenylalanine, histidine, tyrosine and tryptophan) and acidity indicator. Changes in colour detected decarboxylase activity of enterococci. The only positive reactions were determined in samples containing arginine and tyrosine. Cultivation of bacteria was confirmed by PCR. All of the tested microorganisms showed significant activity of tyrosindecarboxylase and arginindecarboxylase which was regulated by temperature and influenced by duration of cultivation. The test of decarboxylase activity using colour changes is suitable for a relatively rapid and inexpensive detection of microorganisms that are able to produce biogenic amines.",

    "abstract": "Spermatozoa must possess many attributes to fertilize an egg but few laboratory methods can assess all of these attributes simultaneously and objectively. Most laboratory methods used to assess the quality of semen in veterinary andrology can be inaccurate and time-consuming. Laboratory techniques which evaluate only one sperm attribute, often provide results that have a weak correlation with fertility. Therefore, semen used for artificial insemination should not be assessed based on the results of one method only but rather on the comprehensive results of several laboratory tests. Flow cytometry is a modern method of analysing diJ169fferent types of cells, including sperm cells. It is based on the scattering of light and fluorescence, the outcome of which yields results that are recorded and evaluated by computer technology which makes an objective assessment. Flow cytometry in combination with fluorescence microscopy and fluorescent probes provides a comprehensive, accurate, objective, and rapid analysis of the ejaculate. In a short time frame it allows us to test thousands of sperm for their structure and properties, even with a minimal amount of semen. This method enables the evaluation of several indicators simultaneously in a population of sperm as a whole or for each sperm individually. It informs us about the selected indicators of sperm quality in the sample by examining the membrane integrity, DNA, mitochondria, acrosome, oxidative stress, and other properties. Flow cytometry has become an important method of evaluating the functional and morphological properties of sperm and is used for research in veterinary science as well as for a routine assessment of the semen quality.",

Significantly higher values ( P &lt; 0.05) measured by the DPPH and FR methods were determined in the liver from rats fed Konini wheat. The chickens fed Konini wheat showed significantly different values using DPPH, FR and ABTS methods. No significant differences were found in hepatopancreases of fish. Animals fed Konini wheat showed a tendency to lower liver enzyme activities in general, but a significant difference was found only in gamma-glutamyl transferase activity in the chicken’s blood. Our results suggest that feeding a higher content of anthocyanins can improve the antioxidant activity and function of the liver tissue.",

    "abstract": "The time around calving in highly productive dairy cows is a critical period in terms of their metabolism, which is connected with high demands of the foetus as well as with the onset of lactation. Retained placenta in cows may have multifactorial aetiology, but in herds which are free from infectious diseases, the most important reasons are; periparturient metabolic changes and disturbances to the internal balance and stress. During the periparturient period, the most important factor causing immune suppression and hypotony of uterus in cows is metabolic stress due to hormonal and nutritional factors, including metabolic fluctuations, negative energy balance, as well as shortage of proteins, minerals, vitamins and antioxidants. This metabolic stress as a result of an imbalance in the internal metabolic homeostasis activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis (HPA) and increases serum corticosterid (cortisol) concentration, especially on the day of calving. Cortisol is a powerful immune suppressive factor that causes depression of leukocyte proliferation and their functions. The periparturient metabolic stress may also stimulate the production of catecholamines, especially adrenalin. Elevated levels of adrenalin activate adrenoreceptors of the myometrium, which in turn cause hypotony or atony of the uterus at calving in cows. Elevated levels of cortisol and adrenalin may significantly inhibit the rejection and expulsion of foetal membranes in cows, resulting in an increased incidence of their retention. These important mechanisms for placental retention in highly productive dairy cows often have primary nutritional metabolic aetiology, but they also occur during secondary metabolic disturbances and metabolic stress during calving. This metabolic and immunological aetiology and pathogenesis of retained placenta usually occur in highly productive periparturient cows on dairy farms in the absence of bovine infectious diseases, which can couse placentitis, stillbirth and the infectious origin of foetal membrane retention. The paper presents the most important metabolic, mineral and immunological disturbances as conditions for retained placenta in dairy cows. It also shows different methods of herd monitoring, important examples of clinical and laboratory diagnostics, and methods of nutritional and veterinary prevention of this health problem in dairy cows.",

    "abstract": "The study focused on the effect of microwave radiation at a dose which commonly does not lead to tissue heating, however, in the rat testes it resulted in accumulation of heat. Adult rats were exposed to whole body pulse radiation at a frequency of 2.45 GHz and mean power density of 28 W/m 2 , for 3 h a day for the duration of 3 weeks. Immediately after each irradiation, the body temperature and the testicular temperature were measured in the control and experimental animals. Samples for histological and immunohistochemical analysis were taken after the last irradiation and processed for light and transmission electron microscopy. An evaluation of spermatozoa motility was performed using computer-assisted sperm analysis. Although the body temperature of the rats was not elevated after the irradiations, the testicular temperature was significantly increased ( P &lt; 0.004). Testes of the experimental animals had considerably dilated and congested blood vessels and the seminiferous epithelium showed degenerative changes. The Leydig cells showed no obvious structural abnormalities. Transmission electron microscopy revealed ultrastructural changes in developing sex cells, Sertoli cells, and endothelial cells. An intensified immunoreactivity to superoxide dismutase 1 was found in spermatogonia and Leydig cells in the experimental animals. Results of the present study revealed a distinctly adverse effect of microwave radiation on the thermoregulatory capability and histological structure of rat testes as well as an oxidative damage of the tissue. The scientific knowledge confirming or denying the thermal effect of microwave radiation on living tissue is scarce and thus the present study may be regarded as unique and helpful to clarify the issue.",

    "abstract": "Production of high-quality carcass and meat from goat kids may contribute to an increase in goat farming profitability. The aim was to compare carcass and meat quality traits of Saanen goat kids raised under natural (NR) and artificial (AR) rearing systems and slaughtered at 80 days and 120 days of age. The AR kids were separated from their dams immediately after birth and were fed with a commercial milk replacer, while the NR kids suckled their mothers. The rearing type did not affect the average daily gain, slaughter weight, hot carcass weight, empty body weight, commercial dressing percentage, subjective conformation and fatness scores. In parallel with the increase in slaughter age, the slaughter weight, hot carcass weight, empty body weight and subjective carcass conformation score increased. The rearing type had no effect on instrumental meat quality traits, except for meat Lightness (L*) and Hue values. Meat from NR kids had higher L* and Hue values 1 h and 24 h after cutting than those of AR kids. Warner-Bratzler shear force value increased with the slaughter age, but the meat lightness decreased. The ultimate pH was generally high in all groups, ranging between 5.94 and 6.10. The panellists evaluated the meat from NR kids to be more tender and juicy and also gave the highest tenderness scores to the meat obtained from the kids slaughtered at 80 days of age. As a conclusion, the slaughter age may be more determinant than the rearing type in the occurrence of carcass and meat quality characteristics.",

Bt maize (e.g. MON 810, Bt 11) which carries the Bt gene is highly resistant to larval feeding of European corn borer, stalk borer, and Southwestern corn borer, depending on Bt toxin (δ toxin) production. Effective measures used to fight pests may often have positive side-effects in that they may also contribute to reducing mycotoxin concentrations. A systematic review has been used for the purposes of evaluating the studies on the reduction of aflatoxins in Bt maize. According to five studies, Bt maize has significantly lower concentrations of aflatoxins than non-Bt maize hybrids, only one study has shown no significant effect of Bt maize. Other studies have shown mixed results (four studies). The results of these studies were influenced by the year of sampling or by using maize breeding lines selected for resistance to aflatoxin accumulation.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this work was to determine the effect of selected freezing curves on spermatozoa survivability after thawing, defined by its motility. The ejaculates of nine selected sires of the same age, breed, and frequency of collecting, bred under the same breeding conditions including handling, stabling, feeding system and feeding ratio composition, were repeatedly collected and evaluated. Sperm samples of each sire were diluted using only one extender and divided into four parts. Selected four freezing curves – the standard, commercially recommended three-phase curve; a two-phase curve; a slow three-phase curve; and a fast three-phase curve, differing in the course of temperature vs time, were applied. The percentage rate of progressive motile spermatozoa above head was determined immediately after thawing, and after 30, 60, 90, and 120 min of the thermodynamic test (TDT). Moreover, average spermatozoa motility (AMOT) and spermatozoa motility decrease (MODE) throughout the entire TDT were evaluated. Insemination doses frozen using the simpler two-phase curve demonstrated the highest motility values (+2.97% to +10.37%; P &lt; 0.05–0.01) immediately after thawing and during the entire TDT. Concurrently, the highest AMOT (+4.37% to +8.82%; P &lt; 0.01) was determined. The highest spermatozoa motility values were detected after thawing doses frozen by the two-phase freezing curve in eight out of nine sires. Simultaneously, a significant effect of sire individuality was clearly confirmed. Inter-sire differences of spermatozoa motility during TDT as well as AMOT and MODE were significant ( P &lt; 0.01). The findings describing both factors of interaction indicate the necessity of individual cryopreservation of the ejaculate to increase its fertilization capability after thawing.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the effects of different lengths of progesterone and equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) treatment on reproductive performance during the non-breeding season in ewes. Progesterone-impregnated sponges were inserted intravaginally for 7 d in Group 1 (G1, n = 24), 9 d in Group 2 (G2, n = 25), and 11 d in Group 3 (G3, n = 24). On the day of sponge removal, eCG (350 IU) was injected and 24 h later the ewes were exposed to rams. Pregnancy was diagnosed by transrectal ultrasonography 30 ± 3 d after mating. Oestrus symptoms of G2 and G3 started earlier than G1, but there was only a significant difference between G1 and G3 ( P = 0.013). In G1, G2, and G3, the oestrus responses were 100%, 100%, and 95.8%, pregnancy rates were 79.2%, 72%, and 75%, lambing rates were 79.8%, 72%, and 75%, litter sizes were 2.5, 2.2, and 2.4, and multiple birth rates were 86.7%, 80%, and 85.7%, respectively ( P &gt; 0.05). In conclusion, the short-term progesterone-impregnated sponge and eCG treatment provided excellent oestrus induction. The effects of different days (7, 9, or 11) of progesterone treatment on reproductive indicators were similar; therefore, the stress caused by the inserted sponge can be reduced by short-term use.",

    "abstract": "Bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) is a multifactorial disease in which, in addition to infectious agents and the individual resistance of animals, technological, management and climatic factors also play a role. Outdoor rearing in small groups has many advantages in terms of BRDC prevention. Continuous real-time monitoring of environmental factors, such as the temperature, relative humidity, air velocity, bioaerosols and harmful gases can also help to prevent damage by BRDC. Low temperatures in combination with elevated relative humidity and windspeed can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Among noxious gases, ammonia may be of the greatest importance for respiratory diseases, as it directly damages the respiratory tract, leaving room and opening gate for pathogenic and opportunistic microbes. Bioaerosols of livestock buildings consist of feed, manure, organic matter from animals (e.g., epithelial cells, hair, urine, faeces), microorganisms, and toxins. Due to their size, particulate matter (PM) particles (PM10 and PM2.5) have important health effects, leading to severe respiratory and systemic diseases. Particulate matter formation and concentration depend on the housing and feeding conditions, species housed, stocking density, animal activity and environmental factors, but also on the sampling periods within a day. High temperature, low humidity, air movement (especially drafts), and increased activity of animals also cause the manure to dry, leading to dust formation and particles becoming airborne. With increased environmental control, the effects of the climatic factors on the calves health can be more easily identified, measures can be taken to reduce them, thus the occurrence and damage of possible diseases (mainly respiratory, BRDC) can be decreased.",

The reformulation was tested on two types of comminuted meat products – Špekáčky sausage with a diameter of up to 46 mm or Bologna-type sausages in diameter of 85 mm (Gothaj sausage) or 75 mm (Junior sausage). The total viable count (TVC) increased only slightly during the four-week storage (4 ± 1 °C) of all batches of Špekáčky sausage. Comparing batches 1.7 and 2.1, there is an evident difference in the number of CFU/g, with samples of Špekáčky 1.7 showing numbers of bacteria higher by approximately 1 logarithmic order throughout practically the entire storage period ( P = 0.001). The population of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) remained well beneath a value of 5.0 log CFU/g even at the end of the experiment. For Bologna-type sausages, the TVC was either beneath the limit of detection or at its boundary in all samples. LAB were not detected during storage of Bologna-type sausages. The results confirmed that the proportion of salt in cooked sausages can be reduced to 1.7% without negatively affecting the shelf life or safety of the final products.",

The experiment was conducted on 40 horses (4–28 years): sport horses (n = 20), and leisure horses (n = 20). The saliva samples were collected non-invasively 15 min before riding (A), 1 min before riding (B), 1 min after riding (C) and 15 min after riding (D). Albumin (Alb), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), α-amylase (AMY), creatine kinase (CK), creatinine (Crea), glucose (Glc), lactate (Lac), triacylglycerols (TG), total protein (TP), urea and lipid peroxidation (TBARS) were measured in saliva. Riding caused a significant change in many biochemical indices (Alb, CK, Glc, Lac, TBARS and urea) compared to baseline values in leisure horses ( P &lt; 0.05) but only in a few indices (Glc, Crea and TBARS) in sport horses. On the other hand, when comparing groups of leisure and sport horses, higher concentrations of Alb, Glc, TG and urea were found in sport horses whereas raised concentrations of CK and Crea were found in leisure horses. The obtained results indicate the adaptation of trained horses to physical effort. Moreover, this study confirms other possibilities of using salivary biochemical properties for physical stress assessment. Other more detailed comparative studies of load response in horses may provide useful information to quantify the reference range of individual stress indices.",

The aim of the study was to examine the possibility that early pecking and scratching experiences by a chick may influence its dustbathing later in life. Pecking experience was controlled in pairs of chicks housed in wire cages by presentation of peat or sand from small boxes. In experiment I (12 pairs) 5 min tests were carried out on days 3-9 and 16-17, whereas on days I D­ IS we allowed the chicks to peck for 30 min in order to elicit dustbathing on a glassplate. Finally, a dustbathing choice test. in which the chicks were allowed full access to dustbathe in the substrates, was carried out on days 16-19. In experiment 2. 8 pairs were given 2 min pecking experience, and 8 pairs 10 min of pecking experience with sand on day 5-9. and all pairs were given 5 min pecking experience on days 3 and 4; the birds were then tested for dustbathing on days 10-15. as in experiment I. [n experiment I, pecking at peat increased from day 3 to 9 and peat was preferred over sand. The amount of pecking at either or both substrates was examined for correlation with later dustbathing performance towards these substrates. and, generally. a positive and significant correlation was found between pecking at peat on day 3. and dustbathing on the glass (day 10-15) as well as with dustbathing in the substrates during the dustbathing choice tests. Furthermore, a regression analysis revealed that the amount of total pecking on day 3-9 was associated with increased dustbathing on days 10-15. Scratching during the 5 min pecking tests was positively correlated with pecking except for scratching while pecking at peat on days 16+17. Scratching on days 16+ 17 while pecking at sand. but not at peat.  as positively correlated with c1ustbathing directed towards sand (30 min tests) and in sand during the dustbathing choice tests. In experiment 2. the chicks that were given most pecking experience on day 5-9 tended to dustbathe more during the 30 min tesh day on 10-15. In conclusion, early pecking (day 3-5) at dusty substrates was related to later dustbathing and may be significant for the development of dust perception in young chicks. whereas scratching while pecking at sand became related to uustbathing in sand after day 10-1 S.",

Significant correlation ( p &lt; 0.05) was found between contents of THg and MeHg and both the weight and the age of fish. Significant differences ( p &lt; 0.05) between THg and MeHg contents were found between individual sites. In 2002, for example, the most contaminated fish were found downstream of Pardubice, followed by fish from upstream of Pardubice and from Hřensko. In 2004, fish from downstream and upstream of the Spolana factory in Neratovice were more contaminated than fish from the Vltava river downstream of Lenora. The methylmercury-tototal mercury ratio in muscle tissue was close to 1.0.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to validate a new method of detection of Paenibacillus larvae spores in the debris and wax of honey bee and compare it with the method commonly used in the Czech Republic, i.e. the method based on dissolving wax components of samples in toluene or benzene and releasing them in a liquid medium. The new method builds on homogenization of the material at the temperature of 70 ± 2 °C, using distilled water and homogenization agent Tween 80. The spores are transferred from the suspension thus created to a liquid medium diluted and treated by heat (90 ± 2 °C) in order to destroy vegetative saprophytic microflora. This medium is then inoculated on solid culture media (blood agar and MYPGP with nalidixic acid) at individual doses of 0.2 ml. After five to eight-day incubation at 37 ± 1 °C, the suspected P. larvae colonies are counted and subjected to confirmation. The count of colonies multiplied by 100 represents the number of spores in 1 g of the material. Eleven debris control samples from circular test and 10 demonstrably positive debris samples containing P. larvae spores were used to compare both methods. The new method was independently tested on other 1,509 field samples of winter debris collected in protection areas around American foulbrood (AFB) outbreaks and examined from 1 January 2006 to 10 May 2006. Of these 1,509 field samples, 46 were P. larvae positive. The comparison of the number of spores found concurrently by both methods in 21 control samples and their benchmarking by the paired t-test method showed that the Tween method was significantly more effective in detection of P. larvae spores in the examined material than the commonly used Toluene method (the t value was -3.524). The test results indicate that the Tween method, as soon as it is tested and validated at other research sites, can be effective in examining the debris and wax of honey bee. Unlike Toluene method based on organic solvents, the Tween method is more acceptable from the point of view of fire protection, environment compatibility, waste disposal and occupational health and safety of laboratory staff. From the scientific perspective, the Tween method could play an important role in early diagnostics and subsequent control of the incidence of American foulbrood not only in the Czech Republic, but also in other countries worldwide.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was, in terms of analysis of causes of disorders in calves on dairy farms, to evaluate occurrence of metabolic disorders in their postnatal period. In 23 agricultural farms (14 farms with the incidence of clinical forms of disease in calves during milk nutrition period - group D; 9 farms with no clinical disease - group H) clinical examination was performed, blood samples were collected and data concerning the provision of permanent day and night care for calves (PDC) during delivery and in early postpartum period were collected. The samples were taken from 3 - 5 calves in every farm (totally 97, H - 38, D - 59). Biochemical indicators that have some relations to the quality of colostral nutrition were determined (the concentrations of immunoglobulins - Ig, total protein - TP, albumin - A, globulins - G, vitamin E and A, the activity of gammaglutamyl transferase - GMT) and to the microelement metabolism (the activities of glutathione peroxidase - GSH-Px for evaluation of selenium (Se) status, the concentrations of copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn)). While evaluating the entire group of examined calves, we found a high occurrence of metabolic disorders in calves connected with colostral nutrition and also high occurrence of microelement deficiencies. The decrease in TP was diagnosed in 80%, the decrease in G in 78%, the decrease in concentration of Ig in 78% and 74% of calves had higher A/G ratio. Insufficient intake of colostrum showed also lower activities of GMT in 76% of calves. Hypovitaminosis E was diagnosed in 67% of calves and hypovitaminosis A in 19% of calves. Microelement deficiencies were found in 77% (Cu), 39% (Se), and 10% (Zn) of calves. While comparing the results for calves in groups H and D, in the group of calves from farms with no clinical disease (H) a significantly higher ( p &lt; 0.01) concentrations of albumin and vitamin E, as well as vitamin A ( p &lt; 0.05) were established. When comparing the farms with provided daylong care (PdC+) and with no daylong care (PdC-), in PdC+ farms calves had a significantly higher ( p &lt; 0.01) concentration of TP and G, GSH-Px activity, and also a significantly lower ( p &lt; 0.01) A/G ratio, which proves a higher-quality colostral nutrition. The results thus prove that the incidence of metabolic disorders in dairy calves in the Czech Republic represents a highly actual problem and that one of the significant factors that influence this condition is the insufficient care for and the related insufficient colostral nutrition of the calves.",

The additive term includes all the substances which, when added to animal food, are capable to improve the animal performance or the physical characteristics of foods. The use of additives is, nowadays, reason of discussion due to the increasing public consumers’ pressure influenced by sensationalist press and demand for natural products. They suggest new regulations on animal feeding, as the prohibition of the use of subproducts of the same species and domestic leftovers and the obrigatoriness of the use of label with the origin of the components of the food. Therefore, the countries that accomplish this variety of requirements, and have competitive price, will have better conditions to produce and export foods in an efficient and competitive way. The Brazilian poultry raising is, without doubts, the animal production sector most modern and efficient of the country, and one of most competitive world-wide. Certainly the capacity of the nutritionists to use the huge variety of additives, collaborates for this scene. The use of additives like antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, simbiotics and exogenous enzymes, have being very emphasized in the animal feeding, because they can contribute to the improvement of the animal performance and even to make possible a higher use of alternative ingredients. In this revision general aspects of the use of these additives in the feeding of birds are discussed.\r\n\r\nKeywords: antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, simbiotics, enzymes.",

The goal of the present study was to investigate the daily rhythms of calcium, inorganic phosphorus and 24,25-(OH) 2 -D 3 , 25-(OH)-D 3 and 1,25-(OH) 2 -D 3 in the blood serum of horses. Five Thoroughbred mares from the same farm, clinically healthy and placed in individual stalls, at the same environmental temperature and photoperiod were used. For 30 days prior to the study, the animals underwent the same pattern of daily activity. Blood samples were collected at 4 h-intervals for 48 consecutive h, starting at 08:00 h of the first day and finishing at 04:00 h of the second day, via intravenous cannula inserted into the jugular vein. Each individual sample was assessed for serum concentration of calcium and inorganic phosphorus by means of a UV spectrophotometric test, and serum concentration of 24, 25-(OH)-D 3 , 25-(OH)-D 3 , and 1,25-(OH) 2 -D 3 were assessed by means of HPLC method. Data analysis was conducted by one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and by the single cosinor method. ANOVA showed a significant effect of time on all the variables studied ( p &lt; 0.0001) and post-hoc test (SNK) showed significant differences ( p &lt; 0.001) comparing all the time intervals of 4 h, on either day. The application of the periodic model and the statistical analysis of the cosinor procedure allowed defining the periodic variables and their acrophases (expressed in hours) during the 2 days of monitoring. Calcium showed diurnal acrophases at 15:00 h for the 1st day and at 15:48 for the 2nd day; inorganic phosphorus showed diurnal coincident acrophases at 14:32 h both for the 1st and 2nd day and 25-(OH)-D 3 showed diurnal acrophases at 14:08 h for the 1st day and at 15:04 h for the 2nd day. The results obtained could be useful for standardizing blood sampling according to the time of day and for optimizing the administration of these substances according to their circadian or other rhythms.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to document the detailed features of the hind limb bones in chinchillas ( Chinchilla lanigera ). Twenty chinchillas (10 females and 10 males) were used. Animals were euthanized and X-ray of appendicular skeleton of pelvis was taken immediately. Then the bones were macerated. The iliac wing was considerably long and the gluteal line formed a distinct crista. The sacropelvic surface ( facies sacropelvina ) was not observed, however, the iliac tuberosity ( tuberositas iliaca ) was evident. While the average distance between the midacetabulum and the tuber coxae (ventral iliac spine) was 33.58 mm in males and 31.34 mm in females, the average distance between the midacetabulum and the ischial tuberosity was 15.09 mm in males and 17.18 mm in females (statistically non-significant). The caput ossis femoris was bent to medial at an average of 60 degrees angle. The differences in both the width and length of the obturator foramen between males and females were statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.05). The third trochanter (trochanter tertius) and the supracondyloid fossa were absent. The tibia and the fibula formed a joint on the proximal and distal parts. The comparative size of the distal tarsal bones were IV &gt; III &gt; I &gt; II (from the largest to the smallest) and the fifth metatarsal bone shaped a small bone. The comparative lengths of the other metatarsal bones were II &gt; III &gt; I &gt; IV (from the longest to the shortest). Three phalanges bones were notable. The proximal phalanx was the biggest of all.",

Also, tetramethrin is known as a knockdown agent on target organism and it is generally used with piperonyl butoxide. In this study, effects of piperonyl butoxide and tetramethrin combinations on biological activities of synthetic pyrethroids, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, and permethrin against different housefly ( Musca domestica Linnaeus, 1758) populations were evaluated. In addition, the biological efficiency of the insecticides used in the study, insecticide + PBO and insecticide + PBO + tetramethrin combinations, against the WHO standard sensitive housefly population and housefly populations collected from different parts of Turkey were compared. Results showed that PBO extensively promoted the ratio of knockdown and killing effect values of the insecticides. The results also indicated that PBO and PBO + tetramethrin combinations moderately reduced the knockdown effect times of all formulation in all housefly populations. The knockdown effect times were more decreased by insecticide + PBO + tetramethrin combinations than insecticides that are used alone and insecticide + PBO combinations.",

Two groups of 6 cows either underwent rumenocentesis (GA) or sham (GB) procedures. Superficial skin temperature of the rumenocentesis area was measured using infrared thermography before the procedure (-1 h), immediately after (0 h), and at 48 h, 96 h, and 20 days following rumenocentesis. Blood samples were collected at all times, except for immediately after the procedure (0 h), and selected immunologic response variables were determined. Milk yield and rectal temperatures were measured daily. Rumenocentesis did not influence the white blood cell count, haptoglobin or total protein concentrations. Electrophoretic protein fractions were not different between GA and GB treatments. Milk yield and rectal temperature were not affected by rumenocentesis. Skin temperature of the rumenocentesis region in GA group cows increased by 1.0 °C immediately after rumenocentesis and returned to baseline after 48 h where it remained constantly until the end of the study; similar to observation in GB group cows. Results of this study would suggest minimal adverse effects on cow health and production when performing rumenocentesis for the diagnosis of subacute ruminal acidosis. Additional more intensive studies addressing animal welfare issues relative to the diagnostic techniques are needed.",

Three test groups of fish were subjected to increasing concentrations (1, 3 and 5 mg/l) of cadmium (Cd) in vivo , respectively. The G6PD and 6PGD activities in the gill, liver, and kidney tissues of each group of fish were measured on days 1, 3, 5 and 7. G6PD and 6PGD enzyme activities, measured in gill, liver and kidney homogenates, were stimulated by various concentrations (1, 3, and 5 mg/l) of cadmium. Although the dose-response pattern of G6PD enzyme activities in liver and kidney tissue was very similar, that in gill was different from both other tissues. The enzyme activity of G6PD enzyme was significantly stimulated after three days (Day 3) in liver and kidney tissues at a dose of 1 mg/l Cd ( p &lt; 0.05), whereas it was stimulated on the first day of experiment (Day 1) in gill, liver and kidney tissues at doses of 3 and 5 mg/l Cd ( p &lt; 0.05). However, the activity of 6PGD was stimulated after three days (Day 3) in the liver at a dose of 1 mg/l Cd ( p &lt; 0.05) and on the first day in gill, liver and kidney tissues at doses of 3 and 5 mg/l Cd ( p &lt; 0.05). The stimulation effect of the 5 mg/l dose of Cd on G6PD and 6PGD enzyme activities was significantly diminished after seven days (Day 7) in all tissues ( p &lt; 0.05).

The stimulation effect of cadmium on the three tissues studied was also calculated; for both of the enzymes (G6PD and 6PGD), the enzyme activity levels were stimulated by approximately 60% and 38% in gills, 68% and 44% in liver, and 67% and 41% in kidneys, respectively, over the base-line enzyme activity of the control groups during the sevenday experimental period.

The spectra were measured in the reflectance mode with transflectance cell in the spectral range of 10,000 – 4,000 cm -1 with 100 scans. Calibration models were developed. They were assessed statistically based on correlation coefficients (R) and standard errors of calibration (SEC). For penicillin, the following values were established: R = 0.951 and SEC = 0.004. For cloxacillin, they were R = 0.871 and SEC = 0.007. These calibration models were verified later with cross-validation. Better results were obtained in the calibration and validation models that were developed on milk samples coming from one farm. Using FT-NIR, the maximum residue limit (MRL) of cloxacillin in milk can be determined. However, standard errors of calibration and validation for penicillin G exceed the fixed MRL. FT-NIR spectroscopy is not a suitable method for accurate determination of these substances in raw milk. Variability in milk composition has a major influence on detection of substances present at very low concentrations.",

However, strategies are used by animals, both at the cellular and behavioral, to prevent intoxication or reduce its negative effects. The interactive effects between the rumen microorganisms and anti-nutritional substances allow the intake of a variety of plant species and ruminants becomes resistant to relatively high concentrations of some anti-nutritional factors.

The animals represented the active population in Pomerania and Kujavia, first calved in 2000 and 2001, and were culled before the end of 2008. Frequency of calvings, which averaged 1.5% for twin births and just 0.02% for triplet births, increased with age of cow and also with increasing milk yield in the preceding lactation. Performance results showed that mothers of twins were superior to mothers of single calves in terms of milk yield (1.3 kg milk/day milking). Despite the greater perinatal mortality of twins and triplets, multiple pregnancies gave rise to a greater number of calves compared to single pregnancies. However, multiple pregnancies were accompanied by adverse effects such as increased proportion of complications requiring human assistance, mechanical assistance and veterinary intervention (1.2 × more). Fertility of the cows deteriorated after multiple pregnancies, with particularly unfavourable indicators of fertility found for triplet births, decreased chance of survival to the next calving, and increased culling rates in cows, especially due to udder diseases, infertility, reproductive diseases, old age, metabolic and gastrointestinal diseases, and locomotor system diseases. It was found that the increasing milk yield was paralleled by the increasing proportion of multiple pregnancies. This has highlighted the need for early and reliable diagnosis and management of twin pregnancies, which is supposed to facilitate parturition and ensure survival of calves.",

Number of jejunal CD4+ and CD8+ cells in group 3 was consistent with values in group 4, despite higher density of E. acervulina meronts on 10 dpi. The quantity of jejunal mucin adherent layer of group 3 was similar to that in group 4. Counts of oocysts in faeces were lower in group 3 than group 2. Results suggest that dietary supplementation of oregano to chickens infected with E. acervulina has a modulating effect on some blood indicators and functions of phagocytes.

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to isolate yeasts from subclinical mastitic cows and to investigate the slime production by the isolated yeasts. The material used in this study included 339 milk samples from 152 dairy cattle with subclinical mastitis. Milk was plated onto blood agar, MacConkey agar and Sabouraud dextrose agar. Forty-one samples (12.1% of total milk samples) were found positive for the yeast by API 20 C AUX identification system. The isolated yeasts were classified into four genera of Candida, Trichosporon, Cryptococcus and Saccharomyces. The Candida species were following: C. krusei , C. kefyr , C. guilliermondii , C. famata , C. rugosa and C. utulis . Other yeasts were identified as Trichosporon mucoides , T. asahii , Cryptococcus laurentii , C. neoformans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Slime production was tested on Congo red brain heart infusion agar and evaluated according to Congo red phenomenon. Fifteen (36.6%) strains were slime factor positive: seven were C. krusei , four C. kefyr , one C. guilliermondii , one C. famata , one T. asahii , and one C. laurentii . The results of the present study indicate that yeast mastitis is significant for causing economic losses and slime production is mostly found in non- albicans Candida species. Therefore, non- albicans Candida species should be examined for slime production.",

A commercial product consisting of 1% alaptide hydrophilic cream is authorised for use in veterinary practice. This study focuses on the formulation of alaptide into semi-synthetic polymer-based hydrogels. The aim of the present study is to prepare hydrogels and to evaluate the liberation of alaptide from hydrogels. The hydrogels were prepared on the basis of three gel-producing substances: methylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose and hydroxypropylcellulose. To enhance the drug release from hydrogel humectants, glycerol, propylene glycol and ethanol in various concentrations were evaluated. The permeation of the alaptide from gels into the acceptor solution was evaluated with the use of the permeable membrane neprophane. The amount of drug released from prepared hydrogels was determined spectrophotometrically. Hydrogels with optimal alaptide liberation properties were subjected to the study of rheological properties in the next phase. The optimal composition of hydrogel as established in this study was 1% alaptide + 3% hydroxyethylcellulose with the addition of 10% glycerol as humectant. Due to the advantageous properties of hydrogels in wounds, alaptide could be incorporated into a hydrogel base for use in veterinary medicine.",

Samples (n = 156) of fish fillets and fish mince of common carp ( Cyprinus carpio ), rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) and perch ( Perca fluviatilis ) were stored at 3 °C and 15 °C. The amines were determined as the N -substituted benzamides, after derivatization with benzoylchloride by micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography. Based on the biogenic amine contents and sensory properties, the shelf life of samples at 3 °C was 11–16 days and 7–10 days for fillets and mince, respectively, and 2–3 days at 15 °C regardless of sample processing. Content of putrescine seems to be a good quality indicator for all examined fish species. The fish species and the method of flesh processing did not have a significant influence on the putrescine formation. Tyramine was formed mainly in carp and trout mince at 15 °C. Samples of good and acceptable quality did not contain toxicologically significant concentrations of histamine or tyramine. Contrary to marine fish, information about biogenic amines contents in freshwater fish is scarce. Comparison of the dynamics of amines formation in fillets and processed fish flesh has not been studied yet. The progress of decomposition processes is compared based on dynamic models.",

A total of 288 fillets were stored for 6 months under stable temperature of –18 °C and unstable temperature, which involved six temperature fluctuation cycles from –18 to –5 °C each month. Glaze determination, chemical composition, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances examination and sensory evaluation of fillets were performed. Glazing and stable temperature conditions slowed down lipid oxidation in fillets compared to unglazed samples and samples stored under unstable freezing conditions. The thiobarbituric acid reactive substances increased slowly in glazed samples and a positive effect of stable conditions was found after two months and became obvious from the fifth month of storage. Sensory scores included evaluation of taste, aroma, texture, juiciness, and appearance corresponded to chemical results. Glazed fillets had the best scores in sensory evaluation and can be recommended for consumption; on the other hand, unglazed fillets stored under unstable temperature could not be consumed because of rancidity. This is the first similar study in mackerel when unstable temperature conditions are considered as a factor increasing lipid oxidation. Prevention of temperature fluctuation during storage is important to keep the quality of the frozen fillets.",

A total of 193 serum samples were collected and analysed by ELISA for the detection of a circulating antigen and specific antibodies against A. vasorum . All dog owners were asked to fill out a questionnaire. Nine dogs (4.7%, 95% Confidence Interval, CI: 2.2–8.7%) were positive for the A. vasorum circulating antigen, seven dogs (3.6%, CI: 1.5–7.3%) had specific antibodies against A. vasorum ; of these, three animals (1.6%, CI: 0.3–4.5%) were positive for both ELISAs. Most of them were under the age of three years. Only three of 13 seropositive dogs were not healthy, namely, in one dog vomitus was observed and two dogs were pyretic. Faecal samples of 5 dogs were positive for C. vulpis L1 (2.0%, CI: 0.6–4.6%). Angiostrongylus vasorum L1 were found in the faecal sample of one dog (0.4%, CI: 0.01–2.2%). This study illustrates the wide-spread occurrence of lungworms in the Czech Republic. Disease awareness of lungworms among animal owners and veterinarians should be implemented.",

Twenty dogs weighing 25 to 50 kg (mean 38 kg) with unilateral stifle osteoarthritis were used for the study. Fourteen dogs were given intra-articular platelet rich plasma treatment and 6 dogs were used as controls. Double centrifuge method was used to obtain platelet-rich plasma. Radiography and ultrasonography of the affected joint were carried out and scores for lameness severity and pain severity were assigned by the attending clinicians. Synovial fluid was collected under sterile conditions at pre-treatment and on the 1 st , 3 rd , 5 th , 7 th , 15 th days, and 4, 8 and 12 weeks after treatment. Gelatin zymography and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay were used to determine the synovial fluid levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). No adverse effects associated with the injection of the platelet concentrate or saline were observed. Hudson Visual Analog Scale and Canine Brief Pain Inventory scores for all components were non-significantly different between weeks 0, 4, 12 for control dogs. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 was totally and MMP-2 was partially inhibited in the platelet-rich plasma group. In the control group, MMP-9 was partially inhibited during the first month and activation started later. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 was constant in control samples throughout the experimental period. Platelet-rich plasma is a safe and effective method for treatment of dogs with osteoarthritis, possibly more useful for early cases with mild and moderate osteoarthritis. It is suggested that plasma rich platelet should be injected several times at regular intervals instead of a single application.",

    "abstract": "The wild boar population has been on a permanent increase over the last decades, causing conflicts with the requirements of modern human society. Existing effort to stabilize wild boar numbers generally fails with one of the causes being the high reproductive potential of wild boar. The aim of this study was to assess the onset of sexual maturity in wild boar males with regard to age, physical frame and environmental conditions on the basis of testicle development and sperm production. This study assessed the dimensions of gonads and the occurrence of sperm in boars caught during common hunts. Environmental conditions were found as an important factor for growth and sexual maturity of wild boar males. The body weight was a more important factor for sperm production than the age of young wild boar males. The weight threshold for sperm production in the testes was 29 kg of live weight, which corresponds to 6 months of age on average. This study has proven that environmental conditions are a significant factor affecting the physical development of male wild boars, more specifically the growth rate of their body frames and the onset of sexual maturity. In a better quality environment boars grow faster and enter puberty at an earlier age. Poor food supply and/or high hunting pressure result in slower body and testicular growth, as well as the production of sperm at a later age (approx. 2-3 months later).",

Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in the concentrations of serum protein fractions in 7 clinically healthy merino lambs (4 males, 3 females) during their first month of life. The first blood sampling was performed before the colostrum intake and then at 1, 2, 7, 14 and 30 days of age. Blood serum was analysed for total serum protein concentrations and for the relative and absolute values of serum protein fractions - albumin, alpha 1 - (α 1 ), alpha 2 - (α 2 ), beta- (β), and gamma- (γ) globulins. The results showed a significant effect of age on the serum total protein concentrations and for all the protein fractions. The concentrations of total proteins and γ-globulins increased significantly 1 day after the colostrum intake ( P &lt; 0.001); then decreased gradually till the end of the 1st month. An opposite trend was observed in the concentrations of albumin. A significant decrease of values was found 1 day after the intake of colostrum ( P &lt; 0.001) with a subsequent progressive increase of values till the end of the evaluated period. The relative concentrations of α 1 -globulins significantly decreased during the first month of life ( P &lt; 0.001). On the other hand, the relative values of α 2 - and β-globulins increased significantly from birth till the end of the monitored period ( P &lt; 0.001). Our results suggest that the serum protein electrophoretic pattern in growing lambs is significantly influenced by the age of the evaluated animal, and this should be taken into consideration when interpreting the serum protein profile. Our findings extend existing knowledge about significant changes in the protein profile associated with the physiological adaptation process in the neonatal period in young animals.",

Selected indicators of non-specific humoral immunity (lysozyme activity, ceruloplasmin activity, total protein and gamma globulin content) were determined in the blood serum of lambs. Compared to control, yeast administered to the experimental group of lambs significantly increased the values of the analyzed meat performance traits i.e. body weight, growth rate, musculus longissimus dorsi dimensions ( P ≤ 0.05) and daily gains ( P ≤ 0.01), pointing to improved muscle development. Lambs fed the yeast showed a significant ( P ≤ 0.01) increase in lysozyme and ceruloplasmin activity and increased serum concentrations of gamma globulins. Significant differences between the experimental and control groups were not observed only with respect to the serum concentrations of total protein. Suuplementing the lambs’ feed with yeast had a positive effect on meat performance traits and indicators of humoral immunity.",

Samples were collected from the choana and the cloaca of 20 healthy captive adult green iguanas and from the biofilm of 15 water containers. The final identification of aerobic bacteria was performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Salmonella positive samples were serotyped. The most common strains observed at each test location were from 1) choanae: Staphylococcus spp., Enterobacter cloacae and Comamonas testosteroni ; 2) cloacae: Citrobacter spp., Salmonella spp. and Corynebacterium spp.; and 3) biofilms: Pseudomonas spp., Salmonella spp. and Acidovorax spp. We showed that apart from Salmonella spp., the choanal and cloacal bacterial flora differed from the microorganisms present in the biofilm of the animal’s water container. These data revealed that healthy captive adult green iguanas harbored several aerobic bacterial strains that in immunosuppressed reptiles may act as opportunistic pathogens. Also, several of the aerobic bacteria identified in samples are potential zoonotic agents. Characterization of the normal background flora in captive reptiles and their environment can contribute to an understanding of the spread of bacterial contamination and the risk of potential zoonotic diseases for people in contact with these animals.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between concentration of non-esterified fatty acid and ketone bodies in blood of dairy cows, and to evaluate these concentrations for the detection of prevalence of subclinical ketosis. The second aim was to compare the concentration of β-hydroxybutyric acid determined by an electronic handheld meter Precision Xtra ® with serum concentration of β-hydroxybutyric acid analysed in laboratory with izotachometric and photometric method, respectively. Blood samples were collected from jugular vein 4–6 h after morning feeding in three groups of Holstein cows (n = 909) according to the lactation phase from 51 different herds with similar husbandry characteristics. High lipomobilization (non-esterified fatty acid ≥ 0.35 mmol·l -1 , mean concentration 0.34 ± 0.15 mmol·l -1 ) was detected in 30.3% of antepartum cows, while increased concentrations of β-hydroxybutyric acid (≥ 1.0 mmol·l -1 , prevalence of subclinical ketosis) were detected in 18.5% and 14.1% of the early lactation and mid lactation cows, respectively. The correlation coefficient (r = 0.84, P &lt; 0.001; r = 0.93, P &lt; 0.001) was found between measurements of whole blood β-hydroxybutyric acid of 60 and 38 dairy cows determined with the Precision Xtra ® test and plasma or serum β-hydroxybutyric acid concentration determined by isotachophoresis and photometrical method, respectively. Our results show that the monitoring of changes in the blood concentration of β-hydroxybutyric acid in high-yielding cows in the early postpartum period by the electronic handheld meter Precision Xtra ® may be effective in reducing the incidence of ketosis and health problems associated with ketosis in dairy cattle herds.",

    "abstract": "Brachyspira hyodysenteriae is the causative agent of swine dysentery. Loss of clinical efficacy of some antimicrobial agents authorized for treating swine dysentery was observed on certain Czech pig farms. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antimicrobial sensitivity of six antibiotics using a set of 202 randomly selected B. hyodysenteriae isolates obtained from farms in the Czech Republic between years 1997 and 2006. Minimum inhibitory concentration of antibiotics tylosin, lincomycin, tylvalosin, chlortetracyclin, tiamulin and valnemulin were tested, using an agar dilution method. All antibiotics tested showed an increase in minimal inhibitory concentrations. Continual decrease in susceptibility of B. hyodysenteriae isolates to tiamulin and valnemulin was observed. Multiresistant B. hyodysenteriae were isolated more frequently in the past years. Only a careful use of antibiotics can ensure their efficacy, especially in case of pleuromutilins, in the strategic therapy of swine dysentery. This rare study demonstrates the minimal inhibitory concentration changes of selected antidysenterics among Czech isolates of Brachyspira hyodysenteriae during a ten-year period.",

In cooperation with the State Veterinary Administration, we recorded findings detected in slaughtered birds within the post mortem veterinary inspection. We analysed the total number of patho-anatomical findings (of intravital origin) and the number of findings divided into acute, chronic and traumatic diseases. In hens, the total ratio of the number of patho-anatomical intravital findings to the number of slaughtered birds (index) was found to be 0.378. This index of the incidence of patho-anatomical findings in hens was higher ( P &lt; 0.001) than that found in broilers (0.016) and turkeys (0.101). The prevailing findings in hens were chronic changes (26.32%), followed by acute changes (5.29%), but also notable were traumatic changes (3.90%). Compared to the findings in broilers which were divided into chronic (0.34%), acute (0.10%) and traumatic diseases (0.02%) and turkey findings which were broken down into chronic (7.60%), acute (0.16%) and traumatic diseases (0.33%), the findings of acute, chronic and traumatic diseases were higher ( P &lt; 0.001) in hens than in broilers and turkeys. These findings show that the health condition and hence the welfare of laying hens as reflected in the patho-anatomical findings during the veterinary inspection of slaughtered birds is significantly worse than the health condition of broilers and turkeys. This demonstrates the need for increased care for laying hens both on farms and in transit to the slaughterhouse.",

Eighteen animals were included in this study. After administration of tramadol, prolapsed penis was cleaned and disinfected. Lidocaine/prilocaine cream at a dose of 1g/10 cm 2 was applied on the penile mucosa. The time interval from lidocaine/prilocaine application to a loss of hind limb withdrawal reflex and the response to penile mucosa pinching was recorded as the induction time for surgical anaesthesia. The time interval from lidocaine/prilocaine application to full restoration of tail and hind limb withdrawal reflex was recorded as the recovery time. In two male chelonians the response to pain stimuli persisted for more than 20 min after lidocaine/prilocaine cream application, and the anaesthetic cream had to be re-administered. After this second application of lidocaine/prilocaine cream, surgical anaesthesia was reached within 28 and 32 min. The mean induction time for surgical anaesthesia was 19.22 ± 4.36 min. The mean recovery time was 40.83 ± 7.68 min. In all 18 male chelonians the surgical treatment of prolapsed penile was uneventful. Topical application of lidocaine/prilocaine cream can be used as a feasible form of local anaesthesia in combination with tramadol analgesia management for minor surgical procedures in chelonians.",

    "abstract": "American foulbrood is a dangerous world-wide spread disease of honey bees caused by the Paenibacillus larvae bacterium. Antibiotic treatments are less effective and leave residues in bee products. It is therefore necessary to find an alternative, especially using natural ingredients such as plant essential oils, probiotics, fatty or organic acids. Two strains of P. larvae were used for this study: CCM 4488, a strain from the Czech collection of micro-organisms and a Slovak field strain which was isolated from infected bee combs and characterized on the basis of biochemical properties. Plant essential oils of sage ( Salvia officinalis ), anise ( Pimpinella anisum ), oregano ( Origanum vulgare ), caraway ( Carum carvi ), thyme ( Thymus vulgaris ), rosemary ( Rosmarinum officinalis ), clove ( Syzygium aromaticum ), camomile ( Chamomilla recutita ) and fennel ( Foeniculum vulgare ) were used for the testing of the inhibitory activity against P. larvae . Essential oils at amounts of 5 µl and 10 µl were applied to sterile discs on MYPGP agar; inhibition zone diameters were measured after 24-h incubation at 37 °C. The strongest inhibitory activity against both P. larvae strains was noted in case of the essential oils from oregano, thyme and clove; essential oils from camomile, rosemary and fennel showed no or weak antibacterial activity. Medium strong inhibition activity was recorded in case of previously untested essential oil from Carum carvi . There was a difference in sensitivity of both tested strains to essential oils. Our study confirmed that some essential oils can be used in the prevention of American foulbrood but further experiments aimed at their influence on physiological intestinal microflora of honey bees must be performed.",

A total of 374 faecal samples from chelonians, lizards and snakes were collected between 2009 and 2012. The nested, two-step PCR and multiplex PCR were performed to access the incidence and to characterize Salmonella isolates. Salmonella strains were found in 122 of 374 samples (32.6%). Among the different reptilian species, Salmonella strains were found in 58 samples from lizards (38.9%), 31 samples from snakes (28.7%) and 33 samples from chelonians (28.2%). Of the total of 122 strains, 72 belonged to the species Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica , 20 to the species S . enterica subs. salamae or S . enterica subs. houtanae . The incidence of S . enterica subs. diarizonae and S . enterica subs. indica was low, constituting less than 3.5% of the examined population. The findings show that reptiles can be considered as a reservoir for Salmonella and hence could pose a zoonotic hazard. In addition, multiplex PCR assay is a rapid, specific and easy-to-perform method and might be applied for rapid screening of large numbers of Salmonella samples.",

    "abstract": "Hepatitis E is an important public health concern disease that causes acute hepatitis in humans with different hepatitis E virus strains reported among domestic and wild animals. In Lithuania, seroprevalence studies on animals considered to be possible virus reservoirs, particularly in wildlife species, had never been investigated before. In order to assess the actual distribution of the virus in the domestic pig and wildlife species, serum samples originating from different geographic areas of Lithuania were tested for the presence of antibodies to the virus using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The study results proved that hepatitis E virus infection is prevalent among domestic pigs, wild boar, moose, and roe deer in Lithuania, with the overall prevalence of IgG antibodies against hepatitis E virus being 43.75%, 57.05%, 11.76%, and 1.20%, respectively. Significantly higher ( P &lt; 0.01) seroprevalence values of 53.66% and 80% were observed in weaned pigs and adult wild boar. Herds with 15 001–30 000 pigs were 2.4 times more likely ( P &lt; 0.01) to test positive for hepatitis E virus antibodies (70.18%), than herds with ≤ 500 pigs (21.11%). The differences in seroprevalence rates between domestic pigs (from 25 to 66.67%) and wild boar (from 42.86 to 73.33% ) in all 10 counties were not significant ( P &gt; 0.05). Estimated low seroprevalence rate in moose, roe deer and absence of antibodies in red deer suggest that such wildlife species are accidental hosts of hepatitis E virus or at least hepatitis E virus is not present in Lithuanian cervides.",

Mammals (cattle, pigs, sheep and goats) generally had a higher PA index than birds (domestic chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, ostriches), with the exception of kids and rabbits. The highest PA index was found in cows (15.13) and piglets (12.18); whereas the lowest PA index was found in broiler chickens (0.102), rabbits, and geese (both 0.14).

A higher PA index was found in a group of adult animals (the PA index ranged from 2.17 to 15.13) and groups of young animals culled from farms (the PA index ranged from 10.79 to 12.18) than in fattened animals (the PA index ranged from 0.10 to 5.32). A comprehensive overview of the health condition of slaughtered animals enables the farmers, veterinarians, transporters and slaughterhouse operators to take appropriate and precisely targeted preventive measures, thereby increasing the animal welfare and health in the future while reducing the incidence of carcass damage.",

    "abstract": "The social nature of sheep makes isolation a major factor affecting not only the welfare of the isolated individual but potentially the entire flock. This study assessed the impact of visual contact with the stressor (wool shearing and hoof trimming) during routine husbandry procedures using infrared thermography (IRT) and behavioural analysis. Sheep were divided into two groups with visual contact during the procedures (VC group) and without visual contact during the procedures (NC group). For each animal, eye temperature and behavioural assessments were conducted before and during the procedure period. The VC group exhibited significantly more active stress-related behaviours, such as increased active time and an absence of lying down, compared to the NC group ( P &lt; 0.05). In contrast, the NC group maintained higher levels of inactivity and exhibited some instances of lying down. Infrared thermography measurements revealed a significant increase in right eye temperature in both groups by the end of the procedures compared to pre-procedure levels ( P &lt; 0.05). Notably, the VC group demonstrated a more pronounced increase in ocular temperature than the NC group during the finishing phase ( P &lt; 0.05), indicating heightened stress responses. These findings suggest that visual contact with conspecifics during husbandry procedures does not mitigate stress but may instead amplify arousal and stress-related responses. This study underscores the importance of considering social factors in animal welfare practices and supports the use of IRT as a reliable, non-invasive tool for stress assessment in sheep.",

Over a thirty-year period, a total of 26 goats and 4 kids were analysed for Cd in kidney, liver, and muscle tissues. In goats, a higher mean Cd content was found in kidneys (0.358 ± 0.091 mg/kg) and liver (0.100 ± 0.022 mg/kg) compared to muscles (0.005 ± 0.001 mg/kg) ( P = 0.006 and P = 0.002, respectively). In kids, the Cd content was 0.009 ± 0.002 mg/kg, 0.012 ± 0.003 mg/kg, 0.005 ± 0.001 mg/kg in the liver, kidneys, and muscle, respectively. The Cd content in both the liver and kidneys differed significantly between kids and goats, being higher in goats ( P = 0.004 and P = 0.007, respectively). Regulation 2023/915 does not set a maximum limit for Cd content in goat liver, kidneys, and muscle for human consumption, but the State Veterinary Administration compares the results with the ‘action limits’ which are the same as for sheep, according to the aforementioned regulation. Although Cd was detected in all examined samples, the ‘action limit’ for human consumption in kids was not exceeded in any sample. In goats, it was exceeded in four of the 26 kidney samples (15% of samples). It is concluded that the consumption of goat meat is not potentially risky to human health but active surveillance is necessary to protect public health.",

    "abstract": "Heavy metals are notorious environmental pollutants with serious health implications for both aquatic ecosystems and human consumers. In 2022, we assessed the cadmium, chromium, mercury, nickel, and lead contents in fish (in wet weight muscle tissue) from two rivers in the Czech Republic subject to pollution incidents, the rivers Bečva and Svratka, to identify potential risks for human consumption. Three fish species were examined: chub ( Squalius cephalus ) from the Bečva (four sites), and chub, perch ( Perca fluviatilis ) and roach ( Rutilus rutilus ) from the Svratka (one site). While concentrations of nickel, chromium, and lead were generally higher in water from the Bečva than the Svratka, all heavy metals (aside from cadmium) were higher in sediment from the Svratka. In chub, nickel concentrations varied greatly between individuals, with the highest concentration reaching 5029.9 µg/kg. In comparison, nickel concentrations in roach and perch were generally low and often below the detection limit (14.8 µg/kg). Mercury concentrations varied between 14.3 and 249.4 µg/kg, with the highest mean concentration found in perch. Cadmium concentrations were highest in the Svratka, though the difference was non-significant, with concentrations in the Bečva mostly under the detection limit (1.49 µg/kg). Lead and chromium concentrations only occasionally exceeded the detection limit, except for one chub in which chromium concentrations exceeded 159.94 µg/kg. In general, aside from nickel, heavy metal concentrations in fish muscle tissue were low and appear not to represent any threat to human health. However, the samples with the highest nickel content could represent a potential risk for nickel-sensitive individuals.",

    "abstract": "The study focused on assessing Cronobacter sakazakii growth in reconstituted powdered infant formula at temperatures ranging from 5 °C to 48 °C using the Baranyi-Roberts model. The count of C. sakazakii was determined by the plate method on ESIA agar (44 °C, 24 h). Bacteria grew in reconstituted milk only at temperatures above 8 °C. The lag phase duration decreased with increasing temperature, from approximately 123.0–141.0 h at 8 °C to 0.931–1.281 h at 44 °C. The growth rate ranged from 0.025–0.027 ln cfu/ml/h (8 °C) to 2.441–2.633 ln cfu/ml/h (44 °C). The resulting growth models imply an increase of more than 4 orders of magnitude in the number of C. sakazakii in less than 17 h at 24 °C; at temperatures of 27 °C and above, the bacteria reach the critical concentration considered in our study (8 log cfu) in a few hours (4.5–11.9 h). In conclusion, it is unsafe and inappropriate to store reconstituted infant milk at temperatures higher than 8 °C.",

    "abstract": "Feline mastocytoma is a round cell neoplasm with variable biological behaviour, characterized by the abnormal proliferation of mast cells, developing in the cutaneous, visceral or intestinal form. The aim was to carry out an integrative literature review on the aetiopathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical signs, diagnosis and treatment of mastocytoma in cats. The databases Periódicos Capes, Google Scholar, PubMed and ScienceDirect were used. The following terms were combined: ‘mast cell’ AND ‘feline or cat’ AND ‘mast cell tumours’ AND ‘cutaneous OR skin mast cell tumours OR spleen OR gastrointestinal OR visceral’, using the specific search form of each platform. Case reports, scientific articles and literature reviews were selected, which were freely accessible, published between 2002 and 2022, in Portuguese or English, and which portrayed the occurrence of mastocytoma in cats. Articles in other languages, dealing with other species, encyclopaedias, event proceedings and publications with access restrictions were excluded. The findings showed that mastocytoma is a frequent neoplasm in cats, commonly presenting as solitary cutaneous masses with a favourable prognosis. However, some cutaneous nodules may be associated with visceral tumours, with an unfavourable prognosis, as well as intestinal mastocytomas, due to their infiltrative nature and high metastatic potential, thus affecting the survival and well-being of these animals. There is a lack of data in the literature on this neoplasm in cats, especially in Brazil. It is therefore important to carry out further studies on the subject, with a view to improving diagnosis and treatment.",

LAQUAtwin devices were ‘compatible’ with i-STAT 1 because the frequency of differences between measurements within ± 20% of the mean was 95.5% in cattle and 94.7% in horses for iCa, 92.7% in cattle and 92.9% in horses for K + , and 100% in both for Na + . No proportional bias was observed between i-STAT 1 and LAQUAtwin Ca-11C and K-11 because the 95% CI for the intercept and slope were 0 and 1, respectively. LAQUAtwin Na-11 showed a good correlation with i-STAT 1 measurements of Na + concentrations in the whole blood of cattle and horses; however, measured values were approximately 4 mM lower with the former. Therefore, the LAQUAtwin series may be applied as a simplified system for measuring iCa, K + , and Na + concentrations in the whole blood of cattle and horses under field conditions; however, caution is required because Na + values were lower than those with i-STAT 1.",

    "abstract": "The increase in testicular temperature caused by cryptorchidism can lead to elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation, and a decrease in antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and others. Clove ( Syzygium aromaticum ) contains eugenol, a compound known for its potent antioxidant properties. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of clove flower extract on spermatogenic cells (spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes, and spermatids) and Leydig cells in albino rats ( Rattus norvegicus ) with surgically induced cryptorchidism. The method used was posttest-only control group design. A total of 24 male rats were randomly assigned to six groups, divided into two treatment durations of 18 days and 36 days. The 18-day interval groups consisted of K-1, K+1, and P+1, while the 36-day interval groups included K-2, K+2, and P+2. One-way ANOVA was used to analyze the number of spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes, spermatids, and Leydig cells. Duncan's multiple range test was applied to data showing significant differences ( P &lt; 0.05). The results indicated that administration of clove flower extract in albino rats with surgically induced cryptorchidism, at both 18-day and 36-day intervals, significantly increased the number of spermatogenic cells (spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes, and spermatids) and Leydig cells. Administration of clove flower extract significantly increased the number of spermatogenic and Leydig cells in albino rats with surgically induced cryptorchidism, indicating its potential as a supportive therapy against oxidative stress-induced testicular damage. Clove flower extract may serve as a temporary supportive therapy in unilateral cryptorchidism cases; however, surgical intervention remains strongly recommended.",

The research focused on evaluating feather, health, and body condition scores, along with the heterophil-to-lymphocyte (H/L) ratio, as indicators of stress and welfare. Our results revealed a significant effect of cage density on feather scores, with higher densities correlating with increased feather loss across all body regions ( P &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, elevated cage densities were associated with a higher incidence of injuries in the cloaca and foot regions, as well as poorer body condition scores ( P &lt; 0.01). Notably, the HB hybrid consistently exhibited superior welfare indicators compared to the IT hybrid, as evidenced by higher feather scores, and higher body condition scores. With the increase in cage density, an increase in the H/L ratio was observed, and accordingly, an increase in stress intensity was determined ( P &lt; 0.01). These findings underscore the complex relationship between cage density, genotype, stress, and welfare outcomes in laying hens, emphasizing the need for further research to elucidate these interactions and develop targeted strategies for improving laying hen welfare in commercial production systems.",

Four ruminally cannulated Simmental cows (6.00 ± 0.83 years; 521.00 ± 9.51 kg body weight) were assigned to a 4 × 4 Latin square over 72 days. Cows received a basal diet (ALG0) or the same diet supplemented with 2.76 (ALG1), 8.22 (ALG2), or 16.3 (ALG3) g/kg odf dry matter (DM) of lyophilized C. vulgaris . Alga supplementation affected ruminal pH ( P = 0.013), which was highest in ALG2 (6.69) and lowest in ALG3 (6.23). Nitrogenous compounds increased with algae inclusion, with NH 3 -N peaking in ALG2 (8.82 mmol/l; P = 0.001) and total nitrogen highest in ALG3 (5.8 g/kg; P &lt; 0.001). Protozoal counts rose significantly with supplementation ( P = 0.001), especially in ALG3. Volatile fatty acid concentrations and molar proportions were unaffected ( P &gt; 0.10), and the acetate-to-propionate ratio remained stable. Blood biochemical indices were largely unchanged ( P &gt; 0.05). Total protein tended to increase, while glucose showed a non-significant decline at the highest alga dose. Other markers, including 3-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB), nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) and liver enzymes, remained within physiological limits. These results suggest that C. vulgaris can enhance nitrogen metabolism and protozoal activity without adversely affecting metabolic health, supporting its potential as a functional feed additive in dairy nutrition.",

The bull was completely andrologically examined by methods of breeding soundness evaluation, which include examination of the libido and ejaculate, and a basic clinical examination of the male reproductive organs. Since penis examination in a bull can pose a problem, it is advisable to use one of the variety of methods of inducing its prolapse, as presented in this clinical case. The anamnesis showed that the patient’s libido was very good. Semen was examined using flow cytometry and subjective microscopicals methods, showing very good quality. The results of the general clinical and laboratory examination did not show any pathological changes. Special attention was paid to the examination of the external and internal reproductive organs which were without pathological findings except for an insufficient penis length proven after artificial penile prolapse using bilateral anaesthesia of the pudental nerves. The diagnosis was established as a congenitally short penis. Breeding soundness evaluation is a complex examination system that evaluates several criteria and a failure in just one criterion can cause the bull to be removed from a breeding programme, as seen in the presented case.",

    "abstract": "Histoplasmosis is caused by a thermally dimorphic ascomycete fungus, Histoplasma capsulatum . Europe has long been considered a non-endemic area for histoplasmosis; however, in recent decades, sporadic cases of histoplasmosis have been confirmed in the European badger ( Meles meles ) in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland. In 2014, an adult male badger carcass was found on a highway on the outskirts of the city of Brno (Southern Moravia, Czech Republic). A gross pathological examination revealed a good overall body condition prior to receiving multiple traumatic injuries from a car impact. However, multiple irregular nodular lesions measuring up to 5 cm in diameter were observed on the skin of the ventral part of the body and the thoracic limbs. Histopathology revealed a granulomatous inflammatory reaction in the lesions, with abundant macrophages multifocally forming large multinucleated giant cells, lymphocytes, plasma cells and scarce granulocytes. The macrophages contained oval to spherical 2.5–3.0 μm yeast-like structures in the cytoplasm. These stained mildly to moderately with haematoxylin and eosin and well with periodic acid Schiff, revealing a small central nucleus surrounded by a clear zone. Other organs showed no macroscopic or microscopic pathology. The internal transcribed spacer rDNA sequence from the skin was identical to a sequence previously detected in a H. capsulatum -infected badger in Germany. This case report detailing cutaneous histoplasmosis in a European badger marks the first documentation of H. capsulatum in the Czech Republic and emphasises the potential for early detection of new and emerging pathogens through wildlife disease monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a bacterium found in the oral cavity of dogs, with a well-documented zoonotic potential. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of C. canimorsus in dogs at different stages of periodontal disease. This was designed as a prospective clinical study. A total of 84 dogs were enrolled and classified into three groups based on clinical examination and the most severely affected tooth according to the stage of periodontitis: dogs with healthy periodontal status, dogs with mild periodontal disease (PD 1 and PD 2 ), and dogs with moderate-to-advanced periodontal disease (PD 3 and PD 4 ). The presence of C. canimorsus was detected using rtPCR from oral swab samples. Chi-squared test ( P &lt; 0.05) was used to assess differences in the frequency of C. canimorsus -positive cases between groups. The overall prevalence of C. canimorsus among the examined dogs was 71%. A significantly higher occurrence of C. canimorsus was observed in group of dogs with PD 1 and PD 2 compared to group with a healthy periodontium ( P = 0.0452) and those with PD 3 and PD 4 ( P = 0.0318). No significant differences were found between dogs with healthy periodontal status and those with PD 3 and PD 4 . These findings suggest that C. canimorsus may play an important role in the early stages of periodontal disease pathogenesis, or alternatively, its presence may reflect natural shifts in microbial composition across different stages of periodontitis. Further studies are warranted to clarify its exact role in disease progression.",

The aim of this study was to investigate changes in selected serum biochemical parameters immunoglobulines, and antioxidants in rats using combinations of beehive air, pollen, and beehive air + pollen. Furthermore, the effect of apiair treatment on asthma and COPD patients was evaluated. Rats were divided into the five groups: (1) Control, (2) sham, (3) beehive air, (4) pollen, and (5) beehive air + pollen. They were treated for 20 days and fed ad libitum . Inorganic phosphate (Pi), zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) concentrations were higher in the beehive air and the beehive air + pollen groups ( P &lt; 0.05), and blood urea nitrogen, immunoglobulin G and M concentrations were higher in the pollen group ( P &lt; 0.05) compared to control. The elevation in blood albumin, Fe, Zn, and Pi concentrations following beehive air treatment ( P &lt; 0.05) and the elevation in blood Fe, Zn, Pi, and calcium concentrations following beehive air + pollen treatment ( P &lt; 0.05) indicated that beehive air alone or in combination with pollen may be an effective supportive treatment option in cases of Zn deficiency disorders, iron deficiency anaemia, hypoalbuminaemia, and hypocalcaemia. Furthermore, the finding of high Zn and Fe concentrations in beehive air ( P &lt; 0.05) may explain the effect of beehive air treatment on pulmonary disorders reported in literature such as asthma and COPD with low blood Zn and Fe concentrations.",

All the 11 phages were characterised and on the basis of morphology plaque, sizes ranging 1–8 µm in diameter were observed. All the phages were stable at temperatures of 50 °C and 60 °C for 48 h but were inviable at 65 °C &gt; 6 h of exposure. Upon UV exposure for 30 min, all the phages were stable but with reduced viability. Whole genome sequencing of a phage showed 97.58% identity to Escherichia phage vB EcoM-ECP26, complete genome. Also phage contigs were identical to antibiotic resistance genes for β-lactamases, tetracyclins, glycopeptides, macrolides, diaminopyrimidines, aminoglycosides and carbapenems in abundance. Thus, it could be concluded from the study that phages harbour various antibiotic resistant genes that could lead to transmission of antibiotic resistance in the host, i.e. bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Alpacas are an increasingly popular hobby species in Europe, characterized by specific requirements and high sensitivity to stress-related factors. Therefore, it is essential to identify which situations or factors trigger stress responses and to apply appropriate, minimally invasive sampling methods for this purpose. A viable approach involves saliva sampling using specialized collection kits, which require minimal animal restraint and handling or the use of thermographic imaging to monitor changes in body surface temperature. In both cases, data and sample collection are non-invasive, without causing pain or compromising physical integrity of the animal. No significant increase in salivary cortisol concentration ( P &gt; 0.05) was observed in eight alpacas before and after veterinary examination. This result may be influenced by the fact that the animals were not habituated to saliva sampling, and the initial collection itself may have induced a stress response, leading to cortisol release even prior to the veterinary procedure. Consequently, the veterinary intervention did not result in a further increase in cortisol levels. The mean salivary cortisol concentrations before and after examination were 3,822.57 ± 698.32 pg/ml and 4,064.60 ± 1,217.55 pg/ml, respectively, with no significant difference ( P &gt; 0.05). The finding that capture alone acts as a significant stressor for alpacas is further supported by a significant increase ( P &lt; 0.05) in the surface temperature of the inner corner of the eye. The temperature measured remotely (36.35 ± 0.91 °C) increased significantly following capture during the veterinary examination (37.56 ± 1.36 °C). Our findings support the potential use of infrared thermography as a sensitive, non-invasive stress indicator in alpacas.",

The aim of this field trial was to compare the effects of toltrazuril (TZL) treatment administered via different routes on the growth performance in suckling piglets. The study was conducted on a commercial Danish pig herd according to a parallel, randomized block design and compared two different treatment protocols: oral administration of TZL and injection of a combination product based on TZL and gleptoferron iron. In total, 763 piglets were included, with 377 piglets treated orally with TZL + iron gleptoferron. Forceris ® , a combination product was used for intramuscular (i.m.) administration to 386 piglets. Faecal scoring and parasitological examinations were conducted at 11–14 days of age (DOA) and again at 18–21 DOA. Piglets treated intramuscularly presented a significantly greater average daily weight gain (ADWG), with a difference of 20 g between the groups; the average weight gain was 209 g (196–223 g), whereas the average weight gain in the orally treated animals was 189 g (175–203 g) ( P = 0.035). Greater oocyst shedding and a frequency of diarrhoea were observed in piglets treated with oral TZL; however, these differences were not significant. This study demonstrated increased treatment efficacy of i.m.-administered TZL for C. suis infection, resulting in increased ADWG and is the first reported trial confirming a difference in outcomes versus those of oral TZL treatment under field conditions.",

    "abstract": "Honey is one of the most commonly adulterated foods. This study therefore focused on innovative possibilities of identifying the botanical origin of honey using Raman spectroscopy and Fourier transform near-infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIR), in order to test their potential use as an alternative to physicochemical analysis and melissopalynology methods. Both mentioned non-destructive methods were used for discrimination and characterization of the honey species. Forty-seven samples of flower and honeydew honey obtained from hobby beekeepers from different regions of the Czech Republic were analysed in the period between 2019 and 2021. Among the floral honeys, poly- as well as monofloral honeys were selected (rapeseed, clover, acacia, phacelia, fruit tree honey). The FT-NIR analysis results confirmed significant differences ( P &lt; 0.05) between the specific-species honey samples for wavenumbers of 5,624, 5,171, 4,780, 4,391 cm -1 ( P &lt; 0.05). Raman spectroscopy confirmed significant differences between multiple wavenumbers, with classification into the most classes confirmed for wavenumbers of 308, 606, 613, 620, 999 and 1,013 cm -1 ( P &lt; 0.05). However, neither method allowed classification for all honey species, thus FT-NIR and Raman spectra were compared by linear discriminant analysis (LDA), which confirmed a high correct classification rate (CCR) of 99.38%, and 91.30% in the case of cross-validation. In the case of rapeseed honey, the lowest CCR (96.15%) and cross-validation (76.92%) values were confirmed. It was confirmed that the FT-NIR method in combination with Raman spectroscopy can be used to identify individual honey species with a high degree of reliability.",

    "abstract": "Gabapentin (GBP) is a widely prescribed antiepileptic and analgesic drug that has increasingly been detected in wastewater and surface water due to its incomplete metabolism and the fact that it is not efficiently removed by conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Its persistence in the aquatic environment has raised concerns due to its possible impact on aquatic organisms. Typical environmental concentrations of GBP range from tens to hundreds of ng/l, with maximums of several µg/l near WWTP effluents. While GBP is not acutely toxic at these amounts, sublethal effects have been observed in aquatic species, particularly in the zebrafish ( Danio rerio ), common carp ( Cyprinus carpio ) and the daphnids ( Daphnia magna ). Reported impacts include disrupted cardiovascular development, oxidative stress, apoptosis, altered gene expression related to immunity and neurodevelopment, and metabolic disturbances. In zebrafish embryos, concentrations of GBP as low as 0.1 µg/l have been associated with enzymatic changes and vascular impairment. Efforts to mitigate the environmental impact of GBP include exploring advanced processing methods for removing GBP from wastewater, such as ozonisation. However, transformation products such as GBP-L may exhibit greater persistence and toxicity than the parent compound. Therefore, further research is urgently needed to understand the fate of GBP in the environment and to develop effective strategies for its removal and risk management. This comprehensive review highlights the dual significance of gabapentin, emphasising its therapeutic potential and the need to address its environmental implications for sustainable healthcare and ecological management.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of antimicrobial resistance and the rate of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) in Escherichia coli isolated from caecum content collected in slaughterhouses located in three regions of Tunisia. E. coli isolates from chicken caecal samples, obtained using media supplemented with cefotaxime, were screened for antimicrobial susceptibility by the disk diffusion method. ESBL production was assessed by the double-disk synergy test, and the presence of β‑lactamase encoding resistance genes was evaluated by PCR. Out of 111 faecal samples, 108 samples were positive for E. coli isolated from media supplemented with cefotaxime with 70% of ESBL-producing isolates. Alarming proportions of resistance against most of the 21 tested antibiotics were observed with 90% of multidrug resistant strains. Most strains exhibited resistance to amoxicillin, cefepime, tetracycline, cephalothin, piperacillin, cefotaxime, aztreonam, streptomycin, ceftazidime, cefuroxime, chloramphenicol, and florfenicol. The same resistance patterns were found in comparison between the three chicken slaughterhouses. A high prevalence of β‑lactamase genes was observed, with bla CTX-M-G1 -ESBL in 79.6% of strains, bla TEM in 45.4%, and bla SHV in 33.3%. The bla CTX-M-G1 and bla TEM genes were significantly more frequent in strains from slaughterhouses A and C. Additionally, carbapenem resistance genes, bla OXA-48 and bla IMP , were demonstrated in 13% and 6.5% of strains, respectively. The study showed high frequency of ESBL-producing E. coli and high antibiotic resistance in broilers. Poultry farms could represent a significant reservoir of ESBL-producing bacteria, suggesting the dissemination of these pathogens to humans and environment. These findings indicate the need for achievement of control and surveillance system.",

The medicated feed was administered in 8 doses (15 g kg -1 live weight). In the study, temperature, oxygen concentration, pH, microbiological, hydrobiological and hydrochemical variables of pond water were monitored. The fish health assessment was based on clinical, pathological-morphological and haematological examinations of 80 individuals in total. The examinations were made before, during, immediately after and 15 days after the administration of medicated feed. No effects on water quality were found. An important histological change after the application of 8 doses was the loss of haematopoietic tissue from the spleen, and dystrophic changes in the renal duct epithelium. A decrease in leukocyte and lymphocyte counts and in total blood plasma protein concentrations ( P &lt; 0.05) were observed already after the 3rd dose of Rupin Special. It follows from the results of the study that Rupin Special should be used in only 4 (exceptionally 6) doses, compared to the originally recommended 8 doses.",

The semistatic method according to OECD 203 was used in the tests. The 96hLC50 NO 2 - value was 386.00 ± 29.75 mg l -1 ( D. rerio aged 20-25 days), and 242.41 ± 13.67 mg l -1 ( D. rerio aged 2-3 months), respectively, at 19 mg Cl - l -1 in diluting water. We observed an increase in 96hLC50 NO 2 - in D. rerio of both developmental stages following an increase in Cl- concentration in diluting water. A comparison between the 96hLC50 NO 2 - determined for D. rerio aged 20-25 days and those aged 2-3 months at different chloride concentrations in diluting water (19; 50; 100 mg l -1 ) showed a highly significant increase ( p &lt; 0.01) in the 96hLC50 NO 2 - for the younger fish at all chloride concentrations. An exponential relationship between 96hLC50 NO 2 - values and chloride concentrations in diluting water (I = 0.849) was demonstrated in D. rerio aged 20-25 days while a logarithmical relationship (I = 0.856) was observed in D. rerio aged 2-3 months.",

The second was originally prepared sorbent including protein G covalently bound on Enzacryl R AH particles. This sorbent has specificity for immunoglobulin IgG and its subclasses only. Finally, mass concentration of immunoglobulins in serum was determined. Two curves expressing time behavior of immunoglobulin content (immunoglobulin mass concentration vs. days after immunization) were used for finding the proper mathematical function.

The experimental group including 36 laying hens received a feeding mixture containing meal made of yellow lupin seed (the JUNO variety) which replaced fish meal used as an animal protein component in feeding mixtures in the control group. Samples of eggs were collected monthly in the course of seven months to determine the colour of egg yolk. Yolk colour was determined by the spectrophotometric method using the CIELAB system. Measurement with the exclusion of gloss was carried out using a portable spectrophotometer. The average values of parameter L* decreased significantly (α = 0.05), which confirmed the darkening of eggs. Parameters a* showed a significant increase (ANOVA α = 0.01), whereas the differences in the individual months ranged from 1.1 to 3.9. Yolk had distinct red-orange colour. Parameters b* did not show significant differences, however, the yolk tended to have an intensive yellow colour. The presence of yellow lupin seed meal in the feeding mixture resulted in a more distinct yellow-red colour of egg yolk.",

Additional identification by species-specific amplification of the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region was consistent with S. canis . All isolates were susceptible to penicillin G and ampicillin. The least effective antimicrobial agent was found to be tetracycline (only 33.8% of susceptible strains).",

    "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from bone marrow are multipotent cells capable of forming cartilage, bone, and other connective tissues. The objective of this study was to determine whether the use of allogenic mesenchymal stem cells could functionally heal a defect in the distal femoral physis in rabbits without the use of immunosuppressive therapy. A iatrogenic defect was created in the lateral femoral condyle of thirty-two New Zealand white rabbits, 7 weeks old, weighing 2.25 ± 0.24 kg. Each defect, 3.5 mm in width and 12 mm in length, in the right distal femoral physis was treated with allogenic mesenchymal stem cells in new composite hyaluronate/collagen type I/fibrin scaffold. The healing response was evaluated radiographically, by MRI (three weeks and four months after implantation) and also histologically, by Pearl’s reaction and with immunofluorescence (four months after implantation). The results were compared with the data for the control defects (without stem cell implantation) in left distal femoral physes. On average, right femurs with a damaged distal physis and transplanted MSCs grew more in length (0.55 ± 0.21 cm) compared with left femurs with a physeal defect without stem cell transplantation (0.46 ± 0.23 cm). Valgus deformity of right femurs with a physeal defect and transplanted MSCs was mild (0.2 ± 0.1 °). On the contrary, left femurs with a physeal defect without transplanted MSCs showed a significant valgus deformity (2.7 ± 1.6 °). For defects treated with allogenic mesenchymal stem cell implants, no adverse immune response and implant rejection were detected in this model. Histologically, no lymphocytic infiltration occurred. At four months after transplantation, hyaline cartilage had formed throughout the defects treated with allogenic MSCs. Labelled mesenchymal stem cells/differentiated chondrocytes were detected in the physeal defects based on magnetic resonance imaging and immunofluorescence. The results of this study demonstrated that allogenic mesenchymal stem cells in a new composite hyaluronate/collagen type I/fibrin scaffold repaired iatrogenic defects in the distal femoral physes in rabbits without the use of immunosuppressive therapy. The use of allogenic mesenchymal stem cells for the repair of physeal defects may be an alternative to autologous MSCs transplantation. An allogenic approach would enable mesenchymal stem cells to be isolated from any donor, providing a readily available source of cells for cartilage tissue repair.",

Blood samples were taken in both groups of examined cows at the following time intervals: just before (time 0) and 8, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240 and 480 min after the intravenous infusion of 1.84 mol l -1 solution of propionate in the amount of 1 ml kg -1 of body weight. Glucose and insulin blood serum values in both groups of cows increased significantly within 120 min of the experiment ( p &lt; 0.05). Significantly lower values ( p &lt; 0.05) of glucose in blood of ketotic cows, compared to the blood value of glucose in healthy cows were established within 30, 60, 120 and 240 min of the experiment, as a consequence of the decreased gluconeogenic ability of the liver in the ketotic cows. Significantly lower values ( p &lt; 0.05) of insulin in blood of ketotic cows in comparison with healthy ones were established within 240 and 480 min of the test. That indicates that the ability of beta cells of the endocrine pancreas to release insulin is reduced in cows suffering from ketosis. After intravenous administration of propionate, it was established that values of inorganic phosphorus were reduced in blood in both groups of cows after 8, 30, 60, 120, 240 and 480 min. Within 480 min of the test there was a significant decrease ( p &lt; 0.05) in blood value of inorganic phosphorus in ketotic cows in comparison with healthy ones. This is linked with the active entry of glucose into glucolytic pathway of peripheral tissues. It can thus be concluded that there is a higher degree of blood glucose utilization by peripheral tissues in ketotic cows.",

Twenty-eight goats with their kids were included in the study. The following variables were assessed: number of born kids in relation to antibody titres of goats; levels of specific antibodies in the blood of goats and kids; and concentrations of immunoglobulins (Ig), total protein (TP) and total globulins (G) in order to define the end of colostral immunity and the start of active production of antibodies in kids under 69 days of age. Specific antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii in goats were detected by IFAT in titres ranging from 0 to 1 280. Out of a total of 28 animals, 5 goats were negative (17.9%) and 23 goats were seropositive (82.1%). The goats delivered 42 kids. A total ratio of number of kids to number of mothers was 1.5. Partial evaluation of results in goats without positive titre against T. gondii before parturition and goats with positive titre showed that negative goats tended to have more kids ( p &lt; 0.1) (ratio 1.80) compared to positive goats (ratio 1.35). A significant decrease in levels of TP, Ig and G was observed between days 27 and 41. Samples taken on days 55 and 69 proved gradual increase of active production of antibody response, which was supported also by a significant increase ( p &lt; 0.01) of monitored non-specific immunity indicators. During this period, we observed increased titres of specific antibodies against toxoplasmosis in 20 kids (5 kids 41 days old, 5 kids 55 days old, and 10 kids 69 days old) and thus we could assume the possibility of vertical transmission of toxoplasmosis.",

Furthermore, DMSO is used as auxiliary substance in toxicity tests on aquatic organisms, usually at concentrations of 0.2 and 0.5 ml l -1 . The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of DMSO on early development, growth and mortality of early life stages in common carp. Tests were performed from fertilized egg to the end of the larval period with continuous exposure to DMSO at concentrations of 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 and 5.0 ml l -1 . Mortality of embryos and larvae, intensity of development and growth, weight and occurrence of abnormalities were analyzed. DMSO exposure at all the tested concentrations did not result in any lethal effects or abnormalities compared to the control over the entire test period (29 days). Growth indicators were similar in DMSO treated (at concentrations of 0.2, 0.5 and 1.0 ml l -1 ) and control groups. However, mean body weight (35 ± 9 mg) of larvae exposed to the highest DMSO concentration (5 ml l -1 ) tested was significantly lower compared to the control (45 ± 14 mg).",

Chickens were fed complete feeding mixtures for the prefattening (BR1), fattening (BR2), and post-fattening (BR3) of broiler chickens. The BR1 feeding mixture was administered to chickens aged 1-10 days, the BR2 feeding mixture was given from Day 11 to Day 30, and the BR3 feeding mixture was then administered until Day 42.

BR2 and BR3 feeding mixtures used to feed chickens aged 11-42 days were fortified with soybean oil (SO Group), rapeseed oil (RO Group), sunflower oil (SFO Group), flaxseed oil (FO Group), olive oil (OO Group), and evening primrose oil (EPO Group). The vegetable oils used differed by the composition of fatty acids, particularly by the content of oleic acid, linoleic acid, α-linolenic acid. The use of the above-described experimental diets in young broilers from Day 11 to 42 had a significant effect on the content of fatty acids in the fat from breast and thigh muscles. The content of α-linolenic acid in breast and thigh muscles of broilers that received the feed containing flaxseed oil (21.16 g/100 g of oil and 17.13 g/100 g of oil, respectively) significantly increased ( p ⪬ 0.01).

The amount of glaze, moisture, fat and protein content were measured. Despite the low fat content in Alaska pollack, a positive effect of glazing and stable freezing conditions of storage on the range of oxidative changes of lipids expressed as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances was found. Total counts of viable cells slightly rose before the end of the storage period in both groups with commercially glazed fish. The average counts of psychrotrophs in each group () were at the same level, ranging from 9.1 ×10 3 CFU·g -1 to 1.1 × 10 4 CFU·g -1 . According to the microbiological results fillets stored under unstable conditions were considered to be acceptable, but sensory evaluation showed that at the end of frozen storage they could not be consumed because of rancidity. Based on our results, glaze application ranged from 10 to 15% guarantee of final quality, however, prevention of temperature fluctuation during storage is important to keep the quality of the frozen fillets. This is the first similar study in Alaska pollack.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this work was to verify the impact of feed supplemented with selected inorganic and organic zinc compounds on the total cholesterol concentrations and other blood plasma indices in breeding cocks. A total of 250 RIR 05 breeding cocks, 9 weeks old, were used. The cocks were divided into 5 groups of 50 animals each (four experimental groups and one control group). Cocks were fed a commercial feed mixture specifically for breeding cocks, containing 30.4 mg·kg -1 of zinc. The feed for experimental groups of cocks was fortified to 100 mg Zn·kg -1 : zinc sulphate in first group, zinc oxide in second group, fodder yeast (Minvital Zn) in third group and Bioplex Zn in fourth group. Blood samples for biochemical examination were taken from the basilic vein. The contents of total cholesterol (Chol), total proteins (TP), glucose (Glu), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P) and magnesium (Mg) in blood plasma were spectrophotometrically measured using a biochemical analyser, Cobas EMira, and commercial kits (Biovendor a.s., Czech Republic). In the 15 th week of age, third and fourth groups showed a significant ( P ≤ 0.05) and highly significant ( P ≤ 0.01) decrease of total cholesterol in blood plasma compared to the control. In the 20 th and 25 th week of age, all of the experimental groups showed a significantand highly significant ( P ≤ 0.01) decrease of total cholesterol in blood plasma compared to the control. Other monitored indices (total proteins, glucoses, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, calcium, phosphorus and magnesium) did not reveal any significant changes between the experimental and the control groups. The presented work provides the first available experimental evidence regarding the impact of zinc supplementation on the cholesterol levels in blood plasma of breeding cocks.",

The fresh cheese environment was modelled in Brain Heart Infusion Broth media and food matrices (pasteurized milk from retail outlets) by internal and external factors (pH = 4.5 and 5.5, 2% NaCl, and t = 8 °C and 15 °C). The counts of enterotoxigenic strains of S. aureus at baseline, i.e. at the time of inoculation of model samples, corresponded to those encountered in the production of fresh cheeses as a result of post-pasteurization contamination. Enumeration of S. aureus was performed in accordance with EN ISO 6888-1, using agar medium. Staphylococcal enterotoxins were detected by the enzyme-linked fluorescence assay. The pH (4.5) and refrigeration temperature (8 °C) used prevented S. aureus from achieving the critical count of 105 cfu·ml -1 specified in Commission Regulation (EC) No. 2073/2005. The highest rates of enterotoxin production were recorded for enterotoxin A. The growth curves of S. aureus derived from model experiments were compared with the growth curve generated by a predictive microbiology program - Pathogen Modelling Program. The results of this study proved the Pathogen Modelling Program to be suitable for use in the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points system in the process of the fresh cheese production to help manufacturers prevent the growth of S. aureus and enterotoxin production.",

    "abstract": "Humans and animals share the same bacterial species including the resistant ones. For that reason, epidemiological studies in domestic and wild animals should be performed on a regular basis. Wild, particularly migratory birds, should be investigated as potential carriers of antimicrobial resistant bacteria that can be spread globally in a short time. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and to characterize multi-resistant Escherichia coli in wild birds. Three hundred and ninety two samples were obtained from different bird species including gulls ( Larus spp.), mallards ( Anas platyrhynchos ), mute swans ( Cygnus olor ), as well as other species of birds. Phenotypical and genotypical resistance of E. coli was investigated. In total 60 isolates from 179 tested were resistant to three or more antimicrobial classes and treated as multi-resistant (33.5%; 95% CI 21.56–45.44); the isolates were obtained from gulls, mallards, swans, and rooks. All of the strains demonstrated resistance to aztreonam and cefpodoxime. The most frequent resistance prevalence of the above-mentioned isolates in vitro was also demonstrated to ampicillin (82%), ampicillin/sulbactam (68%), cefazolin (66%), ceftriaxone (55%), and ciprofloxacin (47%). All E. coli isolates were susceptible to amikacin. The results of polymerase chain reaction confirmed the presence of the genes encoding resistance to beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, tetracycline, amphenicols, trimethoprim, and sulphonamides. Consequently, wild birds might constitute a potential hazard to human and animal health by transmitting multi-resistant E. coli strains to waterways and other environmental sources via bird faeces.",

    "abstract": "Dog adoption success is influenced by many factors. Current research specifically underlines the importance of good behaviour. In order to collect information on the behaviour of adopted dogs, a questionnaire was handed out to people adopting a dog from one of the Czech shelters. According to the respondents to our survey, 72% of dogs exhibited behavioural problems in the first week after adoption. The most frequent behavioural problems in adopted dogs were aggression (24%), fearfulness (21%), destructiveness (17%), excessive vocalisation (15%), and separation anxiety (13%). No effect ( P &gt; 0.05) of sex, age, size or health status was found. However, shelter dogs with a documented history of abuse exhibited problem behaviours after adoption more frequently ( P &lt; 0.05) than non-abused dogs. The follow-up survey revealed significant ( P &lt; 0.001) positive changes in the behaviour of dogs six months after leaving the shelter despite a prevailing lack of previous experience among adopters and a lack of professional help. The results suggest that mere patience and time spent in a family instead of the shelter environment can be a solution to at least some of the behavioural problems encountered. We can assume that if professional post-adoption behavioural counselling was provided it could increase the rate of problems solved and decrease the amount of time required for the solution. Professional help may be particularly necessary in the case of aggressive dogs in which no progress has been seen six months after leaving the shelter.",

The thermal shock (37 °C for 2 min) was applied in the 18 th min after fertilization. Blood was sampled from parallel cultured ten triploids and ten diploids on day 70 after hatching. Ploidy was assessed with the cytogenetic method and measurements of cellular nuclei. In the blood of triploids, significant dominance of immature red blood cells, erythrocytes with a displaced nucleus, microcytes and erythroplastids were observed. The blood of triploids was also characterized by a reduced number of lymphocytes. The percentage of neutrophil and eosinophil granulocytes was elevated; increased share of neutrophil granulocytes with a 4-, 5- or 6-segmented nucleus and eosinophil granulocytes with a nucleus consisting of three and more segments was observed. Disturbances in the picture of red blood cells can be considered as an expression of intensification of end-stage changes in triploids. The response to these changes in the blood of triploid Siberian sturgeon is an increase in the share of polymorphonuclear PMN, cells counted as microphages. Frequent presence of immature red blood cells in triploid Siberian sturgeon is a process that aims at counterbalancing the loss among these blood cells. It is the first report on morphological changes and proportions among blood cells in triploid Siberian sturgeon.",

The antibodies prevalence was higher in cows, in herds that use common pasture and in larger herds ( P &lt; 0.001). The prevalence of persistently infected animals was not connected with the herd size but production management on big farms contributed to maintaining the virus.

    "abstract": "The absence of acquired resistance to antimicrobials has become an important criterion in evaluation of the biosafety of lactobacilli used as industrial starter or probiotic cultures. The aim of this study was to assess antibiotic resistance in starter and non-starter lactobacilli of food origin. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, erythromycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, streptomycin, tetracycline and vancomycin were established in 81 strains of lactobacilli ( L. acidophilus , L. animalis , L. brevis , L. curvatus , L. delbrueckii , L. fermentum , L. helveticus , L. paracasei , L. plantarum , L. rhamnosus and L. sakei ) by the microdilution method. The strains were classified as susceptible or resistant to antimicrobials based on the cut-off values according to the EFSA guideline. Sixty-two strains (77% food isolates, 76% starter or adjunct cultures) were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent (the most frequently to aminoglycosides). Adjunct cultures showed a higher antibiotic resistance (80%) than starters (60%). Four multiresistant strains (3 food isolates, 1 adjunct culture) were analyzed by whole genome sequencing. One potentially transferable aad E gene (responsible for streptomycin resistance) was detected only in one multi-drug resistant strain of L. animalis originating from an adjunct culture. Thus, there is a risk of horizontal transmission of this gene. It is necessary to eliminate such strains from use in the food industry. This study provides relevant data concerning the use of lactobacilli in safe food production. To ensure food safety, detailed characterization of resistance to antimicrobials is necessary not only in starter strains but also in non-starter lactic acid bacteria isolated from food products.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the hygienic quality of the pheasants reared for high-quality meat production by the biogenic amine concentrations in their meat. The content of biogenic amines was measured in the meat of sixty male pheasants killed by pithing and stored uneviscerated for 21 days under different storage temperatures (0 °C, 7 °C and 15 °C). The samples of breast and thigh muscles of pheasant were tested at weekly intervals. Biogenic amines were analysed by reverse phase liquid chromatography and detected by tandem mass spectrometry. Concentrations of biogenic amines (except spermin and spermidin) in thigh muscle were higher than in breast muscle. Highly significant difference ( P &lt; 0.01) was found in tyramine (5.80 mg/kg and 1.38 mg/kg for thigh and breast muscle, respectively), cadaverine (40.80 mg/kg and 14.43 mg/kg for thigh and breast muscle, respectively), putrescine (13.42 mg/kg and 3.16 mg/kg for thigh and breast muscle, respectively) and histamine (5.51 mg/kg and 1.70 mg/kg for thigh and breast muscle, respectively) concentrations after 21 days of storage at 15 °C. This study provides information on the dynamics of biogenic amine formation in pheasant meat during 21 days of storage at different temperatures. Based on our results, we can recommend storing pithed uneviscerated pheasants at 0–7°C for up to 21 days, or at 15 °C for up to 7 days. Concentrations of biogenic amines gained in our study can be helpful in evaluating freshness and hygienic quality of the pheasant game meat.",

Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine relationships among indicators of mature ewes’ nutritional status documented by the body condition score and live weight using ultrasonic evaluation of backfat thickness and depth of musculus longissimus lumborum et thoracis. The monitoring was carried out in Suffolk sheep (n = 942) for a period of 2 years. A significant increase ( P &lt; 0.05 to P &lt; 0.01) of all the evaluated indicators was detected corresponding to an increase of the body condition score from 1 to 5 points. The differences in ewes’ live weights depending on particular condition scores reached up to 31.04 kg with the lowest value (58.71 kg) in 1 point and the highest (89.75 kg) in 5 points. The variability of backfat thickness and muscle depth depending on individual condition scores was up to 352.08% (11.02 mm) in backfat thickness and up to 50.10% (12.83 mm) in muscle depth ( P &lt; 0.05 to 0.01) compared to the lowest condition score of 1 point. Strong positive linear relationships were also detected between the live weight and back tissues development in ewes ( P &lt; 0.001). This study innovatively determinates mutual relationships among growth indicators and body tissue development performed on intensive meat-purpose sheep in vivo . Results of the present study could serve in flock management as a tool for evaluation of the current nutritional status as well as a basic ground for further research focused on development of sheep fattiness and carcass traits evaluation.",

Postparturient dairy cows (n = 200) of Holstein Friesian breed were divided into two groups of 100 individuals. The experimental group received during days 0-7 post partum an oral daily dose of 600 ml of propylene glycol; the control group was without any supplement. The hepatic enzymes, glucose, cholesterol and serum albumin were measured on days 10-15, 45-50 and 70 post partum . Reproduction indicators of dairy cows were calculated from the farm recording data and the milk data record from a regular dairy control (days 10, 20, 30, and 50 post partum ). Animals that received propylene glycol in the first 7 days post partum had reduced activities of aspartate transaminase and gamma-glutamyl transferase, elevated cholesterol concentration ( P &lt; 0.05) and low milk fat percentage ( P &lt; 0.05) compared to control animals. Direct influence of propylene glycol drenching on the calving to first oestrus interval was observed, the smallest values being detected for the cows in the experimental group compared to the control group ( P &lt; 0.05). Our results suggest that some blood indicators of hepatic function, milk fat concentration and calving to first oestrus interval can be improved for 70 days post partum by the use of propylene glycol drenching in the first 7 days post partum . The beneficial effect of this treatment could be evaluated by easily available data, which can be used by practitioners in the field to analyze fertility problems in dairy herds and more exactly to examine whether metabolic stress, among other factors, is involved in the fertility problem.",

This study analyzes such type of biochemistry monitoring in 591 calves (Holstein, Fleckvieh) from 19 large farms in the Czech Republic. All calves, aged 1–6 days, were blood sampled once. Serum concentrations of total protein, albumin, zinc sulphate turbidity units and γ-glutamyltransferase activity were analysed by photometry methods. The samples were divided according to concentrations of total protein and zinc sulphate turbidity units, and the age of calves. These groups were compared using nonparametric tests. The samples had good mean values (total protein 63.5 g·l -1 , albumin 30.5 g·l -1 , zinc sulphate turbidity 11.5 U, γ-glutamyltransferase 10.7 μkat·l -1 ) but 41% and 54% of calves had low total protein (&lt; 60 g·l -1 ) and zinc sulphate turbidity (&lt; 12 U), respectively. The calves with low total protein showed markedly worse values in all indicators ( P &lt; 0.001). The groups according to zinc sulphate turbidity (thresholds 5, 10, 15 U) demonstrated gradual differences ( P &lt; 0.001) in all indicators except albumin. Only γ-glutamyltransferase showed very distinct age-sensitive differences; the highest activity was in 1-day-old calves (18.3 μkat·l -1 ); calves aged 3–6 days had significantly lower activity. It is newly suggested that samples be taken from calves 1–3 days old for γ-glutamyltransferase analysis and traditionally anytime during the first week of life for all other indicators. This first extensive analysis of passive transfer in Central Europe shows that there are widespread deficiencies in the feeding of colostrum to calves.",

Two sets of primers were designed and tested to their specificity on a broad range of ingredients. The identity of amplicons ( Ara h 1- 180 bp, Cor a 1 – 258 bp) by sequencing and alignment of sequences with sequences deposited in Genbank was confirmed. When testing the specificity of designed primer pairs on a spectrum of food ingredients, no cross reactions were detected. A potential inhibition of PCR reaction was eliminated using the universal plant primers of chloroplast gene 124 bp for the plant matrices confirmation. The intrinsic detection limit was 10 pg·ml -1 and the practical detection limit was 0.001% w/w (10 mg·kg -1 ) for both peanuts and hazelnuts. The method was applied to the investigation of 60 commercial food samples. The developed multiplex PCR method is cheap, specific and sensitive enough and can be used as a simple, one day procedure for the checking of undeclared peanut and hazelnut major allergens in food.",

    "abstract": "Bats are presumed primary hosts of trypanosomes of the subgenus Schizotrypanum , including the human pathogen Trypanosoma cruzi . As such, research on bat trypanosomes has been focused on South America, where Chagas disease is a serious issue. While the majority of European studies have been performed in the United Kingdom, there is virtually no data available for Eastern and Central parts of Europe. To address this, the present study aims to identify and assess the prevalence and pathogenicity of trypanosomes in bats sampled in the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, and Poland. Blood collected from 381 adult bats of eight species was tested for presence of trypanosomes using nested polymerase chain reactions. To assess possible impacts of trypanosome parasites on the health status of their hosts, haematological and biochemical analyses were performed for 56 greater mouse-eared bats ( Myotis myotis ) emerging from hibernacula and 36 females of the same species from summer colonies. The overall prevalence of the two trypanosome species detected ( T. dionisii and T. vespertilionis ) was 27%, with a significantly higher prevalence in the Czech Republic compared to the other countries studied. Significant differences in bat trypanosome prevalence in different European countries appear to be connected with presence or absence of possible vectors in summer roosts. No impact of trypanosomes on haematology and blood chemistry parameters was detected in Trypanosoma -positive greater mouse-eared bats. Though T. dionisii infection in bats appears asymptomatic, long-term health consequences still need to be studied in greater detail.",

Two groups of extenders were compared: without LDL addition (control variants) and LDL enriched (experimental variants). Three extenders were used: AndroMed ® , Bioxcell ® , and Triladyl ® . Experimental variants included 4–8% LDL addition into the AndroMed ® and Bioxcell ® extenders, and 6–10% LDL addition into the Triladyl ® extender. In total, 12 samples of fresh semen were collected from 4 bulls during a period of 8 weeks. Bovine spermatozoa cold shock resistance (1 ± 1 °C, 10 min) was evaluated by the percentage rate of live sperm using eosin-nigrosine staining immediately and after heat incubation (37 ± 1 °C, 120 min). The results showed the effect of sire as important and individual differences between selected sires in their sperm resistance against cold shock were confirmed. AndroMed ® and Bioxcell ® were found to be providing better protection of bull semen to cold shock compared to Triladyl ® due to lower decline of live sperm proportion. Our results detected a positive effect of LDL addition on sperm resistance against cold shock, especially on lower decrease of live sperm percentage rate after 120 min of the heat test ( P &lt; 0.05). Further studies are needed to assess the optimal concentration of LDL in various kinds of extenders as well to state ideal time and temperature conditions for ensuring LDL reaction with sperm.",

The impact of distance on transport-related mortality in ducks was demonstrated. The lowest transport-related mortality (0.052%) was found for distances shorter than 50 km. It was significantly ( P &lt; 0.001) lower than the mortality rates connected with longer journeys. The greatest mortality rates were found for transport distances of 101–200 km (0.105%). In addition, the season of the year significantly affected transport-related mortality in Pekin ducks. The highest death losses were found in the summer (0.090%). Death losses of ducks connected with summer transports were significantly higher ( P &lt; 0.001) in comparison with transport-related mortality rates in any other season of the year. The lowest death losses were found in duck transports carried out in the autumn and winter (0.069% and 0.072%, respectively) with no significant difference between those two seasons. Shortening transport distances and maintaining a suitable micro-climate inside transport vehicles especially in the summer are thus two important factors that can contribute to reducing transport-related mortality in Pekin ducks in commercial practice.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and parasite burdens of Coeunurus cerebralis and Oestrus ovis in sheep in Siirt province, Türkiye. Between December 2022 and November 2023, a total of 520 sheep (260 male, 260 female) heads (10 heads per week) were randomly sampled from a butcher. The total prevalence of C. cerebralis was determined to be 12.9%. The prevalence was higher in males, in the Morkaraman breed, in animals younger than two years of age, in dark-coloured ones, in October, and in the right brain hemisphere. The total prevalence of O. ovis was determined to be 38.3%. The prevalence was higher in females, in the Akkaraman breed, in dark-coloured breeds, in age groups older than two years, and in December. In terms of larvae, L 1 was detected in 108 sheep, L 2 in 106 sheep, and L 3 in 139 sheep. A total of 1,039 larvae (278 L 1 , 321 L 2 , and 440 L 3 ) were detected. The significant presence of O. ovis found in the sheep in this study indicates that Siirt province has suitable climatic conditions for O. ovis and larval development. It is recommended to include more animals in a future study in order to determine the exact seasonal prevalence of O. ovis infestation in the region, and to use an antiparasitic drug effective against O. ovis in the routine treatment of sheep to reduce the incidence of this disease.",

The study also took in the determination of the content of dry matter, fat, total and pure proteins, and collagen. There was an increase in the values of all the indices in DFS. A positive correlation ( P &lt; 0.001) was found when comparing PMP values in DFS determined by the reference method and by the method of calculation from the total protein content and from the total creatinine content. No differences between the samples were determined in the observed indices for CH of the highest quality ( P &gt; 0.05). A difference was found in the content of collagen and PMP in CH of standard quality as determined by the reference method between samples CH4 and CH5. A positive correlation ( P &lt; 0.001) was found between the PMP values in CH determined by the reference method and by the method of calculation from the total creatinine content. The results for the PMP content in DFS and CH determined by the direct method using creatinine adsorption are comparable to the results determined by the reference method. The advantage of this method is the determination of creatinine, which is not part of vegetable protein.",

Acta vet. Bmo 1996,65: 151-159. The goal of this paper was to tesl the time of malachite green persistence in rainbow trout after long-term bath as well as to evaluate the quality of randomly sampled marketable rainbow trout from the point of view of malachite green residues. A 6-day-Iasting therapeutic bath of rainbow trout was performed in malachite green of 0.2 mg.l-1concentration. Its residues were then observed in muscle, liver and skin of treated fish. Immediately after the bath. malachite green was detected in mu,de. liver and skin at the levels of 0.712 ± 0.383, 0.83~ and 0.6~9 mg.kg- I . respectively. as a sum of both coloured form and \\eukoform. Eight weeks after the bath. an expressive decrease of the coloured form of malachite green was found while its leukoform was detected in fish as late as after 10 months. Results of analyses were found negative twelve months after the bath. Marketable rainbow trout were randomly sampled for checking the malachite green content on 12 trout farms in the Czech Republic in 1993-1995. Malachite green was found in 2 case (in I of them only as a slightly inneased value in skin) while all other findings were negative. Hence, the results of our study indicate that malachite green persisted in the treated fish as a leukofonn for 10 months. It was evident that the 6-months withdrawal time. recommended in the Czech Republic was insufficient. In case of the frequent one-and-half-year-Iong productive cycle of rainbow trout we therefore do not n.:wmmend to carry out therapeutic baths in malachite green for fish older than 6 months.",

The total milk loss was 600.87 kg for cows that became mastitic in the first six weeks of lactation and was 503.86 kg for cows that became mastitic after the sixth week of lactation. The milk losses of cows that contracted mastitis after the sixth week of lactation, began three weeks before the diagnosis. The mastitic cows failed to reach their healthy levels of milk yield during the rest of the lactation. The results indicate that weekly lactation records are useful in early detection of mastitis.",

The objective of this work was to quantify the rate at which dairy cows die while transported to slaughter facilities, to determine the impact of travel distance on this rate, the seasonal effect on the number of deceased cows, and to identify any developmental trends associated with these losses. In the period of 1997 - 2004, veterinary inspectors in the Czech Republic tracked the deaths of dairy cows in connection with their transportation to slaughter. Of the total number of 1,107,685 monitored dairy cows transported to slaughter in the Czech Republic in the period from 1997 to 2004, 418 dairy cows died. The death rate was determined to be 0.038%. However, the mortality varied depending on the distance travelled, from 0.013% for trips not exceeding 50 km, to 0.183% for trips longer than 300 km. Comparing Period I (1997 - 2000) with Period II (2001 - 2004), the overall death rate of dairy cows attributable to slaughterhouse-bound transportation rose from 0.023% to 0.057% (a 2.51 index) and the difference between periods was highly significant ( p &lt; 0.01). This outcome revealed an undesirable long-range trend of rising dairy cow mortality in all travel distances. The obtained results document a relatively low sensitivity of dairy cows to stresses arising from shipment to slaughter as indicated by transportation-related deaths. However, the growing trend in the number of dairy cows dying on their way to slaughter is a warning sign in relation to the welfare of cows subjected to such transportation.",

The samples were collected before, during and after transport. The correlation between blood cortisol level in fish measured by HPLC and RIA was determined using 66 samples. The correlation was HPLC = 0.9454 RIA + 0.40676 and correlation coefficient was 0.815. From the presented results it can be concluded that both methods (RIA and HPLC) can be used for the determination of plasma (serum) cortisol level.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare the diet composition based on rumen contents of mouflons from two localities differing in food supply. In northern Moravia (NM), secondary forests with dominance of conifers prevailed, whereas in southern Moravia (SM) forests with broad-leaved trees dominated. A total of 50 (NM, n = 23; SM, n = 27) quantitative and qualitative rumen analyses were carried out. In rumen specimens from both localities broad-leaved tree species predominated (NM 32.56% of volume; SM 38.92% v) during the autumn-winter season. Among the woody plants, ash was the most frequently consumed in both localities and in both diets approximately the same amount was found (17% v). In SM the mouflon consumed a high-energy diet of various seeds (34% v); acorns and horse chestnuts were the most abundant. Coniferous shoots were consumed in NM (14% v) twice as much as in SM (7% v). A higher number of food items (S = 70) and food diversity (H' = 3.49) was found in NM than in SM (S = 58; H'= 2.88). The quantitative similarity index (SI) of both diets (individual diet items) was low (SI = 39.12%). When calculated for the main diet groups the SI was higher (73.60%). The nutritional value (metabolisable energy) of the diet was correlated with diet quality (seeds, broad-leaved tree leaves). Mouflon is considered as a typical grazer but we found that during autumn and winter periods both Moravian subpopulations preferred browse and, where available, high-energy food for successful over-wintering. In SM the individuals had a non-significant tendency to be heavier and also their body fat content was higher ( p = 0.035). The body condition of mouflons was thus related to the quality of the food supply in the biotope.",

    "abstract": "The studies were undertaken to investigate the activity response of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) and detoxifying enzyme glutathione-S-transferase (GST) of rats exposed to lead. Enzyme activities were determined in the liver, kidneys and heart of male and female rats that received 100 mg and 1000 mg of lead acetate per litre, respectively, in their drinking water for 18 weeks. Statistical analyses indicated differences related to the organs and to the sex of animals. Administration of lead evoked an increase of the SOD activity in the liver and kidneys both in male and female rats but only in the heart of female rats. GST activity decreased in the liver and heart of male rats, while this activity increased in the liver and heart of female rats. In kidneys, the lower lead dose resulted in a decrease of the GST activity in both groups but the higher dose evoked an increase of activity only in male rats. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), an indicator of oxidative stress, significantly increased in rats that were given the high lead dose, in the kidneys of male rats and in the heart of female rats. Most probably, the observed changes could be a compensatory response to different lead accumulation in the male and female organs and also the possible distinct mechanisms in ROS elimination.",

Semen cryopreservation provides an economy for the producer when reducing the costs with feeding and transport of the stud males, as well as the risks of transmission of sexually transmissible diseases. The goat semen presents an important characteristic that must be considered for its cryopreservation since that the interaction between seminal plasma and egg yolk, a substance largely used in semen extenders, is deleterious for the spermatozoa. This revision makes a general rising concerning the main aspects linked to the cryopreservation of goat semen and updates scientific information on this subject. The usual freezing and thawing methods are discussed, as well as the main extenders and cryoprotectants.",

We evaluated the muscular development of fish in two different experimental conditions: traditional feeding and feeding with addition of propolis (groups A and B, respectively). The study was carried out on two species of teleosts bred in Italy, Oncorhynchus mykiss (rainbow trout) and Salmo trutta (brown trout). The use of propolis reduced mortality of fish eggs. The muscles were stained for myosin ATPase and succinic dehydrogenase to evaluate fibre type. The area, maximum and minimum diameter for each fibre type in relation to the body length were measured. The animals fed propolis showed a more rapid muscular growth compared to control fed the standard diet. Fibres were larger in the Salmo trutta than in the Oncorhynchus mykiss in both groups. In fish of A group, myotomal muscle, the presence of giant fibres and index of environmental stress was noticed. This type of study is valuable in order to extend the use of propolis as an antifungal agent and a natural product that can improve fish farming.",

Fifty six marinated fish products stored at refrigeration temperatures were analyzed before their expiration date. Their fat content was determined by means of the Soxhlet method and the TBARS validated fluorimetric micromethod. Lowest TBARS values were characteristic of warm baked marinades (1.17 ± 0.40 mg MDA/ kg muscle) and in case of cold marinades for the rolled herring fillets with pepper (5.03 ± 0.54 mg MDA/kg muscle) whereas the highest TBARS values were observed in warm cooked marinades (16.48 ± 4.22 mg MDA/kg muscle) and in roll mops sold over the counter (7.61 ± 3.87 mg MDA/kg muscle). The results showed that fat content is not always critical for herring TBARS determination in marinades. For the consumer safety it is essential to pay attention to cold marinades in brine sold over the counter and baked marinades in aspic before their expiration date.",

    "abstract": "Leptin, the product of ob gene, beside its key role in the control of body weight and food consumption, can be involved in the control of embryonic development. Leptin administration in ovo accelerated the embryonic and post-embryonic development in Japanese quail. Although the mechanisms of leptin effects on growth and development acceleration are not clear, stimulation of angiogenesis represents one of plausible explanations. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the pro-angiogenic effect of leptin in vivo in the quail chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). The recombinant murine leptin (10, 100, and 1000 ng) was applied either ex ovo on the CAM surface of ex ovo incubated embryos at embryonic day 7 (ED7) or in ovo into the egg albumen at ED5. Changes in blood vessels were quantified by the fractal analysis providing the fractal dimension (Df) estimate. Leptin administered in ovo was more efficient in stimulation of angiogenesis than the ex ovo treatment, since 10 ng dose elicited significantly higher ( P &lt; 0.001) stimulation of vessel development of the CAM under the air cell than it did after ex ovo cultivation. Our study confirmed that exogenously applied leptin was able to stimulate angiogenesis in CAM. Leptin-mediated stimulation of angiogenesis may improve nutrient utilization from the yolk and explain at least partially the accelerating effect of leptin on avian embryo growth and development.",

Herds of up to 50 cows and those over 50 cows were evaluated both separately and together. Farm management data were collected by means of a questionnaire completed by the farmers. Both geographic and herd characteristics were evaluated, as well as the course of calving, mortality and morbidity in calves, and disease occurrence in cows. Calving was unassisted in about 80% of the cows, and the conception rate was approximately 90%. More difficult courses of calving were reported from the small herds than from the large ones ( p &lt; 0.001). Total calf losses were 10% on the average. Most calf deaths occurred during the first week of life ( p &lt; 0.01), the most common cause of death being diarrhoea ( p &lt; 0.001). The situation was similar in large and small herds.

Blood samples were taken in both groups of examined cows at the following time intervals: just before (time 0) and 30, 60, 120, 180 and 240 min after intravenous infusion of a total of 500 ml of 50% of glucose solution.

Significantly lower values ( p &lt; 0.05) of insulin in blood serum of ketotic cows compared to the healthy ones were established within 30 and 60 min of the test. This indicated that the ability of beta cells of the endocrine pancreas to release insulin is reduced in cows suffering from ketosis. After intravenous infusion of glucose, it was established that values of inorganic phosphorus were decreased in blood in both groups of cows. Within 180 and 240 min of testing there was a significant decrease ( p &lt; 0.05) in the blood value of inorganic phosphorus in ketotic cows compared to the healthy ones. This is linked with the active entry of glucose into the glucolytic pathway of peripheral tissues.

Durante o cultivo avaliou-se a morfologia, o crescimento folicular e a formacao de antro. Foi observado que, na especie caprina, o cultivo com FSHr apresentou percentuais de foliculos morfologicamente normais semelhantes ao controle ate o 12o dia de cultivo (P>0,05), ocorrendo uma reducao deste parâmetro no 18o dia (P<0,05) somente no tratamento com 1000 ng/mL de FSRr.

No que se refere a formacao de antro, em ambas as especies, nao houve diferenca significativa entre os tratamentos com FSHr e o controle. Quanto a analise da configuracao da cromatina, todos os oocitos permaneceram em estadio de vesicula germinativa.

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the addition of cysteamine to the in vitro culture media enhances the yield, hatching rate, total cell number and inner cell mass/total cell number ratio of bovine embryos. A total of 933 bovine oocytes collected from ovaries of 60 slaughtered donors were subjected to in vitro maturation and in vitro fertilization. Following fertilization, embryos were cultured in synthetic oviductal fluid without glucose. After 24 h embryos were transferred into synthetic oviductal fluid with 1.5 mM glucose and 0 (control), 50, 100 and 200 µM of cysteamine. After 48 h, the embryos were transferred into synthetic oviductal fluid with glucose but without cysteamine and cultured until Day 9. The number of cleaved embryos on Day 2, the total number of blastocysts on Day 7 and the number of hatched blastocysts on Day 9 were calculated. Differential staining of inner cell mass and trophectoderm cells of blastocysts were performed on Day 7 and Day 9 of in vitro culture. Supplementation of in vitro culture media with 100 µM cysteamine increased the blastocyst yield ( P &lt; 0.05) without affecting the hatching rate. Furthermore, the embryos cultured in the presence of 100 µM cysteamine had significantly higher number of inner cell mass cells ( P &lt; 0.05) and the proportion of inner cell mass cells ( P &lt; 0.05) compared with the controls. The results of the present study demonstrated that the addition of 100 µM cysteamine to the in vitro culture media improved blastocyst production rate and enhance embryo quality, which could lead to the improvement of the in vitro culture system for bovine embryos.",

The experimental period lasted from weaning to slaughter (359 days). Histopathological and morphometric examinations of ruminal mucosa indicated that the ruminal papillae of bulls from the experimental group were better developed (long with a lower degree of keratinization) compared to the control group. Significant differences between the experimental and control groups were found in the length of ruminal papillae ( p = 0.005), width of stratum corneum ( p = 0.034) and degree of mucosal keratinization on the surface of ruminal papillae ( p = 0.014). Conclusive results of morphometric analysis prove the facility of the use of morphometrics as a method useful for veterinary pathology, mainly for the accuracy of the histological diagnosis.",

In the experiment which lasted for 12 months (6 months for each of the two periods), 14 sport horses with 2 types of feed rations were monitored. The blood was collected at the beginning of the experiment and every 2 months (three blood collections for each period). Feed rations had a negative effect on Ca (3.40 mmol·l -1 and 3.32 mmol·l -1 ) and K (3.2 mmol·l -1 and 2.98 mmol·l -1 ) concentrations in equine serum obtained from the second and third blood collection, respectively. Concentration of P (1.28 mmol·l -1 and 1.20 mmol·l -1 ) in equine serum obtained from the second and third blood collection, respectively, was higher ( P &lt; 0.05) compared to the first blood collection. Concentrations of Mg and Na were in reference intervals. In the 2 nd period of experiment, feed rations were adjusted based on individual requirements of the monitored horses; the proportion of the mineral ingredient in the feed rations was lowered. More balanced concentrations of Ca, Mg, Na and K were detected in equine blood serum as a result of lower intake of the minerals from feed; the concentration of P was, except for one case, higher than in the 1 st period. We observed a positive effect of individual ration compositions based on the results of blood mineral profile. The study describes for the first time the effect of a high and adequate long-term intake of macroelements on their concentrations in sport horses’ blood serum.",

    "abstract": "In veterinary medicine, thrombo-embolism (TE) is an under-appreciated medical condition that requires immediate recognition. Since TE is multifactorial and its mode of presentation may vary, veterinarians face great difficulties in making a definitive diagnosis in a timely manner. In addition, most of the underlying conditions that give rise to TE are life-threatening and an aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic approach is required. Not only does the diagnosis and treatment of this condition require the collaboration of many specialties, the costs of therapy can be excessive with a high risk of recurrence. As such, owners have to be thoroughly informed before the therapy commences. While TE has been well-characterized in humans and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, little information of similar quality is available in veterinary medicine. In addition, TE in animals is distinct from its human counterpart and we cannot simply adapt what is known from human clinical trials. With the promise of improvements in imaging modalities that improve our diagnostic capabilities, the window of opportunity to treat TE increases. This article focuses on aetiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of dogs and cats affected by TE.",

    "abstract": "Serial transabdominal ultrasonographic scanning was performed to measure femur and humerus length of foetuses of Saanen goats to establish their gestational stage. Data were obtained from 38 goats that became pregnant after artificial insemination. Animals were restrained in a supine position on a special table designed for this purpose. Humerus and femur length were measured at weekly intervals starting from week 8 of gestation till the end of gestation. Real-time ultrasound scanner equipped with switchable frequency (5-7.5 MHz) micro convex probe was used in the present study. Humerus and femur length showed strong positive correlation with gestational age (r 2 = 0.95). Measurements of humerus and femur of foetuses are useful indicators to predict gestational age at the 2 nd and 3 rd trimesters in Saanen goats. Measuring of only one bone length is quite enough. Incorporating of both measurements within a multiple regression equation did not improve predictive capacity of the bones. The results of the study were used to construct reference charts and gestational equations in Saanen goats utilizing humerus and femur measurements. In Sudan, this is the first study utilizing measurements of the femur and humerus and the first study comparing the length of the humerus and femur for predicting gestational age in Saanen goats.",

Relatively higher prevalence of M. pachydermatis was found in samples taken from males (45.2%) than in females (35.2%), and in geriatric dogs (63.6%) than in young (42.5%) or adult (38.5%) dogs. Malassezia pachydermatis was isolated more often from ear swabs (44.8%) than from skin swabs (38.9%). Prevalence of M. pachydermatis was significantly higher ( p &lt; 0.05) in samples from the trunk area (60.3%) than in samples from other skin areas. Significantly higher prevalence was found in samples from long-haired (51.5%) and short-haired (45.9%) dogs compared to smooth-haired (21.4%) dogs. The prevalence was relatively higher in the samples taken in autumn (52.6%), than the other seasons: spring (36.1%), summer (27.3%), winter (45.7%); those differences were not significant. Malassezia pachydermatis is one of the most frequent yeasts isolated in dogs. Knowledge of factors predisposing to development of infection is valuable attribute of the correct diagnostic approach and case management.",

    "abstract": "Many invasive procedures, including surgery (ear cropping, tail docking, and debarking in the dog), are performed on dogs for purely cosmetic reasons or convenience. These procedures, also known as “cosmetic surgery”, fall into a variety of categories from the questionably unethical to the undoubtedly criminal, because they are mostly carried out solely to alter a dog’s physical appearance. Although in several European countries these procedures are banned, except when performed by a veterinarian for medical reasons, veterinarians are often requested to perform them for various reasons. Though controversial, canine cosmetic surgery continues to be performed, reaching epidemic proportions. The authors summarize legislation, individual positions and veterinary attitudes regarding cosmetic surgery in Italy and the Czech Republic. Additionally, they explain the ways in which the law is being used in the two countries to prevent these unnecessary procedures, and how current and future anti-cruelty laws can stop unethical use of cosmetic surgery.",

    "abstract": "As the most common grain contaminant worldwide, deoxynivalenol is of high importance despite its low toxicity compared to other trichothecene mycotoxins. Data on the effects of deoxynivalenol in rabbits are scarce. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary deoxynivalenol fed at a high level (10 mg/kg of feed) on the productive performance, blood indices, immunological variables, histopathological changes, and genotoxicity in rabbits. Forty-eight Pannon White rabbits were exposed to contaminated diets for three weeks. Despite its high concentration, deoxynivalenol did not affect the feed intake, body weight, and body weight gain. Liver and kidney function was not affected, as shown by the clinical chemistry indices. Conversely, in two rabbits the toxin caused mild fibrosis of the liver, without degenerative changes of the hepatocytes. No genotoxicity could be observed either. Gut cytokines and the phagocytic activity of the macrophages did not differ significantly. The percentage of neutrophils was significantly lower, whereas that of eosinophils was significantly higher in the toxin-fed group. Deoxynivalenol did not cause significant changes in gut and villus morphology. In 4 out of the 6 deoxynivalenol-treated animals, the ratio of lymphoblast proliferation and simultaneous apoptosis shifted towards apoptosis in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. In the central part of the lymphoid follicles of the spleen, lymphocyte depletion and follicular atrophy could be detected. It can be concluded that rabbits are less sensitive to deoxynivalenol, but the findings confirm that this Fusarium toxin is capable of modulating the immune response.",

Different quality and price of tuna species can lead the producer to the adulteration of food products.

All complete mitochondrial DNA sequences of skipjack tuna ( Katsuwonus pelamis ) and yellowfin tuna ( Thunnus albacares ) were compared to all other mitochondrial DNA sequences of tuna fish deposited in the GenBank. The most variable regions within species were determined and primers and probes were designed in this region for the species-specific DNA amplification of skipjack tuna and yellowfin tuna. Moreover, to check the content of amplifiable DNA of fish (namely tuna) in the sample, primers and a probe of mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene in the region of conservative sequence were designed. Real time PCR methods were verified by investigating 51 samples of canned tuna with the declared content of tuna species from the market; the species was confirmed in all tested samples. This method was designed to be suitable for the determination of DNA sequences especially in highly heat treated products.",

One of them is Leiber Beta-S (β-1,3/1,6-D-glucan) whose immunostimulatory effects have not yet been fully evaluated, in particular in polygastric animals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of this supplement on selected indicators of cellular and humoral immunity in calves. The experiment was performed on 14 calves aged 30 ± 2 days, divided into two equal groups of control and experimental animals. The feed administered to calves of the experimental group was supplemented with Leiber Beta-S at 50 mg/kg body weight, whereas control calves were administered standard farm-made feed without supplementation. Blood was sampled before the experiment (day 0) and on days 15, 30 and 60 to determine the immunity indicators (proliferative response of lipopolysaccharide- and concanavalin A-stimulated lymphocytes, respiratory burst activity, potential killing activity of phagocytes, gamma globulin concentrations, lysozyme activity, ceruloplasmin activity) and biochemical indicator (total protein concentrations). Diet supplemented with Leiber Beta-S stimulated the immune system of calves.

    "abstract": "Rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) was monitored for the duration of one year, from 2 to 14 months of age (n = 120). The study was performed on a farm with through-running water from the basin of water processing plant in the years 2007 and 2008. During the first months of fish life, we analyzed homogenized samples (n = 12) of rainbow trout bodies. From the 8 th month the samples of twelve rainbow trouts were analysed. The total contents of arsenic and arsenobetaine were quantified in muscle, liver, spleen and bile separately. The total arsenic was determined by hydride technique AAS and arsenobetaine by high performance liquid chromatography combined with detection using atomic fluorescence spectrometry. The concentration of arsenic in homogenized body samples grew ( P &lt; 0.01) during the first months of life, from the 6 th month of rearing no significant difference was found. The concentration of arsenobetaine in homogenized bodies was low during the first months and from the 6 th month the concentration stayed on invariable level and amounted to 46 ± 6% of total arsenic. The highest concentrations of arsenic and arsenobetaine in tissues ranked in the order muscle, liver, spleen and bile. In summer months the total arsenic in muscle was bonded in the form of arsenobetaine, in winter months the content of arsenobetaine dropped to 50% of total arsenic. The content of arsenic in liver samples remained the same during the entire monitoring, however, the ratio of arsenobetaine content altered. In summer months it reached the maximum 27%, in winter months it dropped to 7% of arsenic. The concentration of arsenic in spleen and bile decreased in winter months, arsenobetaine corresponded to the value assessed in liver. This study proved the effect of the small content of arsenic in feedstuff on accumulation of total arsenic and arsenobetaine in the tissue of rainbow trout during the growing period and season.",

Texture profile analyses in tench, two years old, ( Tinca tinca L.) was investigated using instrumental texture profile method, focused on hardness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess and chewiness performed with Texture Analyser TA.XTPlus. One group of fish was raised extensively in natural earth pond conditions; the other group was intensively cultured in a recirculation system, feeding on a commercial diet for 7 months. Twelve fish (6 females and 6 males) from each group were used for analyses. Flesh of male tench in both groups was harder, more gummy and chewy, compared to female. Springiness was lower in tench male from intensive culture and cohesiveness lower in females from both groups. The result of texture analysis in the extensive culture group was 16.01 N for hardness and 0.72, 0.66, 10.73 and 7.69 for springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess and chewiness, respectively. In the intensive culture group it was 15.16 N for hardness and 0.59, 0.52, 8.06 and 4.96 for springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess and chewiness, respectively. The results proved that the flesh of fish raised extensively is harder, springier, more cohesive and more gummy, and thus more appealing to consumers. This is the first similar study of texture profile of tench.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to verify the possibility of replacing soybean oil in a diet with glycerol, and investigate the effect of glycerol on performance indicators and health in broiler chickens. The experiment was performed on 122 one-day-old chickens that were divided based on sex into two control groups (30 females and 31 males) and two experimental groups (30 females and 31 males). Half (50%) of the soybean oil in diets used in the experimental groups was replaced with glycerol at a ratio of 1:2. On 15, 32 and 38 day of age chickens of both sexes in the experimental group that were fed with diets containing glycerol showed significantly higher ( p ≤ 0.01) mean body weight compared to the control group. At the end of the experiment, the mean weight of chickens in the control group was 2.078 kg, whereas the mean weight of chickens in the experimental group was 2.341 kg. In females, the overall consumption of diets within 38 days of fattening was 3.588 kg in the control group and 4.011 kg in the experimental group, in males, it was 3.915 kg in the control group and 4.366 kg in the experimental group, i.e. it was higher in experimental chickens. Feed conversion in chickens in experimental groups was better, being 1.84 kg in the control group and 1.81 kg in the experimental group in females, and 1.73 kg in the control group and 1.72 kg in the experimental group in males. It follows from our results that the optimum amount of glycerol in feed for poultry is 5%.This study presents an original solution to optimize feed formula by replacing plant oil with glycerol. The results of the study can improve production indicators and economy in broiler fattening.",

    "abstract": "Campylobacter infection is one of the most common enteric human diseases world-wide but the mechanism of Campylobacter pathogenicity has not been exactly explained yet. One of the main reasons is genotypic, hence phenotypic diversity of the bacterial isolates. The aim of the present study was to perform a molecular characterization of randomly selected C . jejuni and C. coli strains isolated from poultry faeces and carcasses in Poland. Several virulence gene markers were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Furthermore, genetic typing has also been used by the macrorestriction profiling with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The results of the present study showed that all analyzed isolates of C. jejuni (n = 24) and C. coli (n = 24) contained the flaA and cadF sequences. On the other hand, the virB11 gene was present only in 6 of 48 (12.5%) of the analyzed isolates, whereas most of the strains contained the cdt genes. Other virulence gene iam linked to Campylobacter invasiveness was present in 34 of 48 (72.9%) strains. The restriction analysis of the whole genome digested with Sma I produced three main clonal groups designed as I, II (with two subgroups IIa and IIb), and III obtained by the comparison of macrorestriction profiling patterns. The results showed a poor correlation between Campylobacter profiles generated by a clonal molecular technique and the presence of virulence markers. Therefore, PCR detection of Campylobacter virulence markers can be utilized as a simple and rapid tool to discriminate stains recovered from different sources, especially when used in conjunction with the PFGE profile analysis as a complex strategy. These kinds of analyses had not been previously carried out in Poland and these results may generate more knowledge regarding the genetic diversity and molecular relationship of Campylobacter.",

    "abstract": "Routine methods for the evaluation of sperm quality are not sufficiently useful to determine the sensitivity of sperm cells to cold shock. The aim of our preliminary study was to determine whether the sperm plasma membrane integrity evaluated by modified hypoosmotic swelling test based on simple hypoosmotic swelling test (HOS test) and eosin-nigrosin staining could be helpful in predicting the degree of boar sperm survivability during semen cryopreservation. Ejaculates collected from 24 boars and 20 bulls were used in the experiment. Fresh ejaculates were evaluated by routine sperm analysis and a modified HOS test, and subsequently frozen. Sperm cryosurvivability was defined as the percentage of motile spermatozoa that survived the freezing process. A higher percentage of sperm was recovered after the thawing of semen with a higher percentage of HOS-positive and eosin-negative sperm ( P &lt; 0.01). Both indicators were found to be correlated (r = 0.707 and r = 0.705, respectively; P &lt; 0.01). Moreover, the percentage of HOS-positive and eosin-negative sperm was similar to the percentage of viable sperm after thawing as determined by traditional eosin-nigrosin staining in boars (50.90 ± 9.88% and 49.31 ± 11.63%, respectively) and bulls (55.91 ± 10.34% and 55.63 ± 6.64%, respectively) and both indicators showed a positive correlation (r = 0.558 and r = 0.504, respectively; P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, based on the obtained results, we can assume that the modified HOS test can detect differences in sperm membrane resistance which allows assessment of semen quality from the perspective of its further use, e.g. cryopreservation.",

Thirty layers fed a diet containing soybean oil constituted the control group (soybean oil is the most frequently used oil added to feeding mixtures). In the experimental group (thirty layers), soybean oil was replaced with linseed oil at the same amount (3 kg of oil per 100 kg of feeding mixture). Feeding was provided ad libitum for all days of the month. After one month, egg yolks were analysed and the fatty acid profile was compared. Significant differences ( P ≤ 0.05) were found in the concentration of myristic acid that belongs to the group of saturated fatty acids. Eggs in the experimental group showed higher concentrations of myristic acid compared to the control group (0.20 g/100 g of fat and 0.18 g/100 g of fat, respectively). Highly significant differences ( P ≤ 0.01) were found for heptadecanoic acid but the trend was opposite to that of myristic acid; concentrations of heptadecanoic acid in the experimental group were lower than those in the control group. Highly significant differences ( P ≤ 0.01) were found for n-9 monounsaturated fatty acids where egg yolks in eggs from layers fed linseed oil contained higher concentrations of oleic acid, myristoleic acid, and palmitoleic acid. Lower concentrations of n-6 fatty acids ( P ≤ 0.01) were found after the addition of linseed oil in eggs. Linseed oil showed a positive effect on n-3 fatty acids (α-linolenic acid), its concentration in the control and experimental group was 0.82 g/100 g of fat and 5.63 g/100 g of fat, respectively. The possibility of influencing the fatty acid profile in eggs is very important for the development of functional foods.",

Differences between gilts of both breeds were observed in some traits of the reproductive system, such as the uterine weight without the broad ligament ( P ≤ 0.05) and the uterine capacity ( P ≤ 0.01). Polish Landrace gilts were characterized with higher uterine weight and higher uterine capacity; they were also younger at the time of slaughter ( P ≤ 0.05). No BB homozygote relative to the oestrogen receptor gene was found in the examined populations of Polish Landrace gilts. Also, a very low number of gilts with the AA genotype relative to follicle stimulating hormone gene was observed in both populations. Polymorphism of the examined genes had an effect on numerous traits which define the size of particular uterine sections, and thus it influenced the development of potential fertility of gilts before they entered the reproductive cycle. Based on our results we can conclude that genetic determination of reproductive potential occurs already in prepubertal gilts. The results may be used for the prognosis of fertility potential in gilts.",

Some reports indicate the importance of interactions among iron and components of the insulin-like growth factor system. The aim of the study was to determine if there is a relationship between serum iron and insulin-like growth factor-I concentrations in neonatal calves. Blood samples were collected from 16 female Holstein-Friesian calves on day 10 of age. Erythrogram determination and measurements of serum iron, total protein, albumin, total iron binding capacity and serum insulin-like growth factor-I concentrations were performed. Haematological values were measured using an automatic analyzer, biochemical properties were determined spectrophotometrically, insulin-like growth factor-I concentration was measured by radioimmunoassay. Calves were divided into 2 groups according to iron concentrations; the first group of iron-deficient calves (n = 8, Fe &lt; 10 μmol/l) and the second group of calves with optimal iron concentration (n = 8, Fe &gt; 18 μmol/l). Blood indicators in all calves from the first group followed a pattern typically observed in anaemic calves. Insulin-like growth factor-I concentrations were significantly ( P &lt; 0.01) lower in the first group compared to the second group. However, insulin-like growth factor-I very strongly correlated with iron in calves from the second group compared to iron-deficient calves (r = 0.624; P &lt; 0.01 and r = 0.478; P &gt; 0.05, respectively). Based on our results, iron seems to have an important relationship to secretion of insulin-like growth factor-I in 10-day-old calves. This is the first report about such relationship in this age group of animals.",

The diets were fed as a total mixed ration. Results obtained with feeding Diet C (high concentration of available nutrients) to dairy cows confirmed a significant increase in 2,6-diaminopimelic acid from the initial mean 2.2 μg/ml at 21 days before calving to 6.2 μg/ml ( P &lt; 0.01) at 21 days after calving or 7.6 μg/ml ( P &lt; 0.01) at early lactation, and a parallel significant increase in the concentration of volatile fatty acids ( P &lt; 0.01).

All indicators of rumen fermentation and synthesis determined in dairy cows with Diet B (low concentration of available nutrients) of the total mix ration according to productive phases were not significant. High regression coefficients of examined indicators of 2,6-diaminopimelic acid to volatile fatty acid (r = 0.813), propionic acid (r = 0.780) and acetic acid (r = 0.635) indicate direct correlation between fermentation and synthesis activities of the rumen. Our results show that 2,6-diaminopimelic acid appears as a perspective marker for the monitoring and evaluation of the synthesis function of the rumen and production of bacterial biomass under breeding conditions.",

    "abstract": "The aim of study was to characterize 52 samples of Slovak honeys of six types (multifloral, acacia, rape, honeydew, forest and mixed). Physico-chemical analysis of honey included the water content, free acidity, pH, water activity, electrical conductivity, and hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) content. In addition, the colour of honeys was measured using spectrophotometer and Commission Internationale de I`Eclairage method (CIE L*a*b*); four types of honey were used for identification: multifloral, acacia, rape, and honeydew. Mean values of physico-chemical indicators were as follows: water content 16–21%, acidity 6–42 mekv·kg -1 , pH 3.68–5.15, water activity 0.505–0.667, electrical conductivity 0.155–1.585 mS·cm -1 and HMF content 0.17–78.5 mg·kg -1 . The highest HMF content was found in forest honey with one sample above the limit established by Council Directive 2001/110/EC. The colour of Slovak honeys analysed in this study was very variable and ranged from pale yellow to dark brown. Differences of physico-chemical indicators and colour of honey samples were found to be significant ( P &lt; 0.05). The CIE L*a*b* methods can be used for identification of selected honey samples. This is the first similar study on Slovak honey.",

    "abstract": "Phthalic acid, di-n-butyl ester known as di-n-butyl phthalate, is an organic chemical compound that belongs to the group of endocrine disruptor compounds that have a documented negative impact on mammalian endocrine systems. Di-n-butyl phthalate is used widely as a plasticizer in the manufacture of artificial materials, which is why it is found in all types of environmental samples including those from water basins. The aim of the study was to describe the impact of di-n-butyl phthalate on the development of the reproductive system of European pikeperch ( Sander lucioperca ) during the sex differentiation period (age 61–96 days post hatch). A total of 240 fish were divided into 6 groups (40 fish per tank). Treatments consisted of a control group (0 g di-n-butyl phthalate·kg -1 feed) and five trial groups with 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 g di-n-butyl phthalate·kg -1 feed, respectively. Histological changes of the fish gonads, sex ratio, survival and growth of fish were evaluated. Di-n-butyl phthalate seriously disturbed sex differentiation process of pikeperch. Histopathological analyses revealed that the administration of 2 g di-n-butyl phthalate·kg -1 significantly affected the sex ratio. The feminization process (intersex gonads) at concentrations of 1 g and 2 g di-n-butyl phthalate·kg -1 were observed. All analyzed concentrations delayed testicular development. Phthalate did not have a significant impact on the survival or growth rates of the pikeperch. This is the first report of disruption sex differentiation processes in fish by di-n-butyl phthalate.",

The aim of this work was to study the effect of micro-encapsulated n-3 fatty acids added into dry sausages. Samples of dry sausages (Poličan and Vysočina) enriched with unsaturated fatty acids (36 g for 6 kg of mixture) and rosemary extract (0.3 g·kg -1 ) were made along with control samples. Physicochemical, instrumental analyses were performed, fatty acid profile was measured by gas chromatography, and oxidation processes were monitored by determination of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. No significant differences ( P ≥ 0.05) in quality indicators were found between samples, however, there were differences in oxidation processes. Sausages enriched with unsaturated fatty acids showed an increase in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (&gt; 2 mg·kg -1 and &gt; 3 mg·kg -1 in Poličan and Vysočina, respectively, compared to control). Sausages enriched with unsaturated fatty acids and also with rosemary extract have the similar concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances as the control. An increase in the proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids was seen in samples of Poličan supplemented with unsaturated fatty acids in combination with rosemary extract. The addition of rosemary extract had also a significant effect in increasing the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in samples of Vysočina. From the viewpoint of quality indicators, changes in the properties of the product were not seen in any samples.",

    "abstract": "Insulin resistance in early lactation includes low glucose concentration, low insulin release and responsiveness and high lipolysis. Niacin is important antilipolytic agent and leads to increase glucose and insulin concentration. The objectives of this study were to determine the influence of niacin on the insulin resistance in cows during early lactation using the difference of value and regression analysis between blood non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA), glucose and insulin concentrations, revised quantitative insulin sensitivity check index and glucose-to-insulin ratio. Niacin supplementation led to a decrease of NEFA concentration and an increase of glucose and insulin concentrations during the first three weeks after calving. Cows in the niacin group which were more resistant to insulin showed higher concentrations of non-esterified fatty acid in comparison with more sensitive cows from the same group, but still lower than the control. The regression analyses suggest the following characteristics of cows supplemented with niacin in comparison with the control group: the insulin response to glucose was more intense; the antilipolytic effect of insulin was lower; insulin efficiency expressed as glucose-to-insulin ratio increase with a decrease in NEFA. The metabolic changes due to niacin supplementation showed a dual influence on the insulin resistance in dairy cows during early lactation: decreased NEFA concentrations led to a decrease in the insulin resistance (due to an increase in insulin efficiency and insulin sensitivity index), but increased concentrations of insulin and glucose possibly caused an increase in the insulin resistance in dairy cows (due to lower insulin sensitivity index and possibly lower antilipolytic effects of insulin).",

While the frequency of certain comfort behaviour patterns decreased ( P &lt; 0.05) in response to transport and change of the environment, grooming, resting, sleeping as well as playful behaviour (chasing, climbing) were not affected ( P &gt; 0.05). No changes were found in the frequency of behaviour connected to metabolic events with the exception of defecation. Lemur females defecated more frequently ( P &lt; 0.05) in their new environment. The frequency of neither fear nor exploratory behaviour differed ( P &gt; 0.05) before and after transport. The positive effect of the novelty was shown by the reduction ( P &lt; 0.01) of behavioural signs of frustration and stereotypical behaviour after transport. In response to transport, a significant ( P &lt; 0.05) increase of FGM levels was found the second day after the transport, reaching peak levels in the morning and starting to decline to baseline levels in the afternoon. The results of both behaviour and adrenocortical activity analysis suggest that despite some presented changes in the monitored indices prior and after transport, the transportation under the studied conditions presented only a mild stressor with limited behavioural and glucocorticoid responses.",

Cats presented with lower urinary tract disease signs that had undergone a thorough physical examination and urinalysis (dipstick, urine specific gravity, urine sediment and dipslide urine culture) were included in the study. Urine samples were collected only by cystocentesis or sterile catheterization. Bloodwork, abdominal ultrasound, and abdominal radiographs were performed in 118 (66%), 170 (96%) and 9 (5%) patients, respectively. Cats that were treated with antibiotics or glucocorticoids during an episode of feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD) or during the foregoing month and which had undergone perineal urethrostomy or catheterization in private practice, were excluded. The study population consisted of 177 cats. Forty-one (23%) cats were diagnosed with a urethral plug, 26 cats (14%) with a urinary tract infection (UTI), 9 cats (5%) with urolithiasis and 101 cats (57%) with feline idiopathic cystitis (FIC). The cats diagnosed with UTI were significantly older than the cats with FIC, urethral plugs and urolithiasis. Urinary tract infection was diagnosed significantly more often in patients older than 10 years, and in female cats. The diagnosis of urethral plug was made significantly more often in males. Feline idiopathic cystitis and urethral plugs are the most common causes of FLUTD, and the causes are significantly age and sex-related.",

    "abstract": "The heterotherm immune system undergoes significant variation in response to life cycle periodicity and torpor. As heterothermic bats are important reservoirs of zoonotic agents and modulation of immune activity can affect host-pathogen interactions, this work aimed at developing a suitable method for assessing heterotherm phagocyte activity. Chemiluminescence measurements were evaluated by mathematical and mechanistic approaches, both of which yielded comparable results in time-related parameters of phagocyte activity. Using a mathematical method, however, we developed a model that can be applied to particular specimens. The proposed equation offers a simple and reliable tool for comparing phagocyte activity, the values of which can be used for further analysis. While time-related parameters of bat phagocyte activity varied with measurement temperature, with the onset of respiratory burst at 38 °C being quicker than at 25 °C, quantitative values ​​of phagocyte activity were not influenced by measurement temperature. Further, homeotherm phagocyte activity parameters were more variable at 25 °C. Considering there was no influence of measurement temperature on the total volume of heterotherm phagocyte activity, we suggest that parameters measured at 25 °C are more representative of the immune status adapted to physiological extremes at low body temperatures.",

From 2010 to 2017, a total of 20 550 072 finisher pigs, 484 710 sows, and 94 279 piglets were slaughtered in the Czech Republic. By comparing the overall amount of patho-anatomic findings expressed as an index of the ratio of the number of findings to the number of slaughtered animals, the highest incidence of patho-anatomic findings was determined in piglets (index 1.52), followed by sows (index 1.23), and the lowest in finisher pigs (index 0.81). The most numerous was the occurrence of chronic findings (finisher pigs: index 0.724%, sows: 0.926, piglets: 0.877). Furthermore, a high frequency of acute findings was found (finisher pigs: index 0.037, sows: 0.207, piglets: 0.373).

A total of 192 trout were examined. Control samples (96 samples) were simply packaged in contact with atmospheric oxygen, while experimental samples (96 samples) were packaged in a commercial vacuum (98%). All the samples were stored at 2 ± 2° C for 11 days. Analyses were performed on storage days 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, and 11. During the experiment, a w values increased in both types of packaging (in air: 0.982; vacuum-packaged: 0.989). At the end of storage, TVBN and TMA concentrations were at 28.88 ± 4.42 and 19.28 ± 3.00 g mg·100 -1 , respectively, in the muscle of vacuum-packaged trout; and at 30.52 ± 2.91 and 19.94 ± 2.05 mg·100 g -1 , respectively, in fish in simple packaging. The FFA content in vacuum-packaged fish initially declined before increasing to 3.67 ± 2.37% of total fat as oleic acid later in the experiment. The pattern of PV changes was inconclusive, and significant changes ( P &lt; 0.01) were observed in both types of packaging.

Free fatty acids are not a good indicator of spoilage because they are converted to hydroperoxides. Vacuum packaging effectively slowed down oxidative changes in rainbow trout muscle. The peroxide content is not a suitable indicator of shelf life as peroxides are decomposed to secondary products. Total volatile basic nitrogen and thiobarbituric acid value can be recommended as suitable indicators of freshness and shelf life.",

    "abstract": "In aquaculture, acute infections may result in fish mortality, but in many cases the chronic effects of infections are not readily detected, and may result in a decrease in fish growth. Ligictaluridus floridanus is a gill monogenean parasite prevalent on channel catfish ( Ictalurus punctatus ) farms in Northeastern Mexico. In order to assess and evaluate the impact of the chronic infection with this monogenean, 400 six-month-old catfish fingerlings from a hatchery, with a fork length of 10–15 cm were used in this study. Catfish naturally infected with L. floridanus (parasite abundance was 18) were divided in two groups of 200 fish. One group was treated with formalin, and infection was eliminated during a week, while the other group was not treated, and was used as a control. In total, 111 fish of each group were selected, placed into aquaria, and observed for 12 weeks. Indicators of growth such as fork length, mean weight, condition index, specific growth rate, feed conversion index and feed consumed were assessed. Significant differences ( P &lt; 0.05) between the treated group and control were found in the mean weight (127.85 g and 107.63 g) and specific growth rate (1.79 and 1.58), respectively. No significant differences were found in the other growth indicators assessed. We proved that growth performance of channel catfish is affected by infection with L. floridanus , which influence the farm economy. This is the first report on the effect of L. floridanus on the growth performance of channel catfish.",

    "abstract": "This review discusses the consequences of the food chain contamination with radionuclides, especially focusing on the radiocaesium impact after the Chernobyl nuclear accident. In particular, the 137 Cs isotope still represents a risk. Until present it is still detectable in the meat of game animals, especially in wild boar, but also in elk and reindeer. Although the occurrence of highly contaminated foods in most of Europe is currently limited, along the German-Czech border (the Šumava Region) the activity concentration of the 137 Cs isotope in the meat of wild boar exceeds the acceptable limit several times. Additionally, the article describes simple processing technologies (cooking, pickling etc.) that lead to reduction of radionuclides in contaminated food.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to describe cloacoscopy in the loggerhead turtle ( Caretta caretta ) and to evaluate its efficacy in clinical practice. Cloacoscopy was performed on 31 turtles, 23 females and 8 males. Thirty minutes before anaesthesia, meloxicam (0.4 mg/kg) was administered intramuscularly. Turtles were anaesthetised with a combination of 0.04 mg/kg dexmedetomidine and 4 mg/kg ketamine administered intramuscularly. Cloacoscopy was performed with a diagnostic telescope (10 mm diameter, 30 cm long, 0°, with an operating sheath) or with a flexible colonoscope (13 mm diameter, 160 cm long). Turtles were placed in dorsal recumbence and endoscope was inserted through the vent. In the distal part of the proctodeum, phallus or clitoris were easily visualized. A finger and thumb were placed around the vent to act as a valve in order to control the fluid infusion. Flushing the cloaca with warm saline and 0.6% lidocaine allowed clear view. The urethral orifice was located centrally within the urogenital sinus. Further proximally, the slit of the urodeum with the distal sphincter of the colon could be visualized. Passing gently through the urethral orifice allowed direct visualization of the urinary bladder. After withdrawing and re-directing the endoscope into the coprodeum, the terminal part of the intestine was reached. From 31 loggerhead turtles examined, fishing lines were found in 23 animals. Cloacoscopy proved to be a feasible diagnostic method and it is suggested as a routine diagnostic tool for clinical assessment of loggerhead turtle patients.",

    "abstract": "Three client-owned dogs presented with dysuria and stranguria. Prostatic and bladder trigone neoplasms were diagnosed, and these patients also exhibited flat ribbon-like stools. One patient had previously undergone cutaneous ureterostomy after radical cystectomy but experienced recurrent ostia stenosis and severe uremic dermatopathy. Ureterostomy was performed as a salvage procedure, diverting urine to either the uterine stump or the prepuce. The patients recovered well, resulting in an improved quality of life. Unfortunately, one patient died during the immediate postoperative period due to pulmonary metastasis. The uterine stump is considered a better option for ureterostomy as it provides a greater barrier against ascending infections compared to ureteral anastomosis in the vagina, theoretically. These modified ureteral anastomoses offer a viable urinary diversion for patients undergoing complete cystectomy, maintaining an anatomic route for urination. The procedure of modified preputial ureterostomy, without the performance of penectomy, reduces postoperative morbidity and provides increased protection for the ostia. This study aims to describe a modified technique for ureterostomy following total cystectomy in dogs, diverting ureters either to the prepuce or the uterine stump, while preserving the original voiding ostium.",

We aimed to reveal the biochemical reflection of the acute phase response by detecting the changes in serum acute phase proteins in cattle naturally infected with the bovine ephemeral fever virus. The material of this study consisted of 21 Simmental dairy cows (4–6 years old) naturally infected with bovine ephemeral fever virus (infected group) and 10 clinically and serologically healthy Simmental dairy cows (control group). The prevalence of the disease in suspected cattle was 52 per 100. It was determined that in infected cows levels of serum haptoglobin, serum amyloid A ( P &lt; 0.001), and ceruloplasmin increased significantly ( P &lt; 0.05), whereas levels of albumin decreased significantly ( P &lt; 0.05). It is thought that the acute phase proteins variation pattern for bovine ephemeral fever would be beneficial both in better understanding the pathogenesis of the disease and in determining the diagnosis and prognosis correctly.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of selenium (Se) deficiency in Angus Aberdeen (AA) cows and calves during the grazing season on several farms in different geographical locations of the Czech Republic. Selenium deficiency was diagnosed by measuring Se concentrations in whole blood. A total of 78 cows and 78 calves aged 3 to 6 months were examined in eight herds. The reference range of blood Se in cows and calves is 80 to 120 ug/l. Lower values are indicative of deficiency. Overall, Se deficiency was observed in 39.75% cows and 80.76% calves. Suboptimal Se status was mainly a consequence of low Se concentration in pasture vegetation. The Se concentration in plants ranged from 0.032 to 0.086 mg/kg on dry matter basis. Selenium deficiency adversely affected fertility and natality in cattle. In the herd with the highest prevalence of Se deficiency (Herd 2), the number of calves reared till 6 months of age per 100 cows (natality) was as low as 80. The findings show that the grazing cattle suffered from major Se deficiency. The results of the study highlight the importance of implementing early diagnosis, effective prevention, and use of appropriate mineral supplements.",

Both methods belong to cultivation laboratory methods for the detection of Gram-positive (staphylococci and streptococci), and Gram-negative bacteria directly under on-farm conditions. During the study, 520 cows were examined on dairy farms localized in the east of Slovakia. Subsequently, 144-quarter milk samples from the positive cows with California mastitis test scores 1–3 underwent laboratory cultivation on both rapid tests. Values obtained from these tests showed the sensitivity of positive samples using the MicroMast test at the level of 84.7% and the sensitivity of the ClearMilk test at the level of 93.1%. After biochemical and protein identification of cultured isolates, the main pathogens present on both rapid tests MicroMast and ClearMilk were identified as Staphylococcus spp. ( S. aureus and S. chromogenes ) and Streptococcus spp. ( Str. bovis ). Based on the results, both tests are comparable and therefore they can potentially be used in practice for rapid detection of udder pathogens.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to determine antiemetic efficacy of prophylactic administration of dexamethasone, metoclopramide or acepromazine and their influence on sedation in cats sedated with xylazine hydrochloride. Ten healthy adult cats (5 males and 5 females) were used. The prophylactic antiemetic effects of dexamethasone (4 mg/kg of body weight, IM), metoclopramide (0.4 mg/kg of body weight, IM), acepromazine (0.1 mg/kg of body weight, IM) or saline (0.9% NaCI) solution (0.1 ml/kg, IM) administered 1 hour before administration of xylazine hydrochloride (2 mg/kg, IM) was evaluated. Initially, the cats were given saline treatment (day 0); sequentially they were given dexamethasone, metoclopramide or acepromazine at 1 week intervals. After a xylazine injection, all cats were observed for 90 minutes for the assesment of frequency of emesis, and the time until the onset of the first emetic episode, and the determination of xylazine-induced sedation time. Prior treatment with 4 mg/kg of dexamethasone significantly reduced the frequency of emetic episodes but no alteration was observed in the time until the onset of the first emetic episode after the xylazine injection. Metoclopramide and acepromazine did not alter the frequency of emetic episodes but metoclopramide significantly prolonged the onset of the first emetic episode. Dexamethasone (4 mg/kg, IM) significantly decreased the frequency of emetic episodes without affecting the time until the onset of the first emetic episode, xylazine-induced sedation in cats.",

    "abstract": "The Turkish Van cat originates from eastern Turkey. One of the characteristic features of Van cats is the colour of their eyes, which can be both eyes blue, both eyes amber or one eye blue and the other amber. Serum essential trace, macro and industrial element concentrations of Van cats (n = 47) according to sex, age, hair length and eye colour differences were investigated. Serum aluminium, arsenic, boron, barium, cobalt, chromium, copper, gallium, indium, iron, lead, lithium, manganese, nickel, selenium, silver, sulphur, strontium, vanadium and zinc were measured with ICP-OES plasma optical atomic emission spectrometer. In result, serum aluminium, barium, copper, manganese and strontium levels in male cats were found higher ( p &lt; 0.05) than in female cats. Serum aluminium, copper, manganese, strontium and zinc amounts of blue-blue eyed cats were found higher ( p &lt; 0.05) than amber-amber, amber-blue and blue-amber eyed cats, and serum lithium of blue-amber eyed cats was higher ( p &lt; 0.05) than blue-blue eyed cats. There were no statistically significant differences ( p &amp;#x003E 0.05) found in the age and hair length groups. Our results indicate that several of the blood serum elements of Van cats may be related to their eye colours and sex differences.",

A survey was conducted with the owners of 80 dogs with behaviour problems in 2000 - 2004. The questionnaire consisted of questions related to the demographics of the problems the owners observed in their dogs. Sixty eight dogs were selected from animals referred to the Clinic of the Internal Medicine Department of the Uludag University, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and 12 dogs were selected at a private kennel. The 68 dogs diagnosed at the clinic as having behaviour problems represented 6.2% of the 1086 patient dogs older than 6 months seen in the same period. Twelve dogs with behaviour problems were selected from a total of 150 dogs at a private kennel. A total of 110 behavioural problems were detected. Some dogs showed more than one behavioural disorder. The classification of the problems was as follows: 65 dogs (59%) with aggression, 13 dogs (12%) with separation anxiety, 12 dogs (10.5%) with phobia of veterinary clinics and high-volume noises such as thunders and fireworks, 12 dogs (10.5%) with compulsive disorders (9 dogs with tail chasing, 2 dogs with lick dermatitis, 1 dog with self mutilation), 4 dogs (4%) with inappropriate elimination, 2 dogs (2%) with coprophagia, and 1 dog (1%) with puppy killing, 1 dog (1%) with false pregnancy. The breeds most often presented in our study were: German shepherd (19%), Terrier (18%), mixed breed (15%), Anatolian sheepdog (10%). The results of the study showed that behavioural problems are common among dogs in Bursa and aggression ranks first, followed by separation anxiety, phobia and tail chasing.",

It was assumed that the egg drop syndrome virus might be one of the etiological agents responsible for the abnormalities in the egg production. The systematic serological monitoring, using a haemagglutination inhibition test, showed that the antibodies to the egg drop syndrome virus existed in 94.4 and 55.1% of the sera analysed in 2002 and 2003, respectively. The haemagglutination inhibition titres ranged from 16 to 128. The sera samples were randomly collected from 11 - to 46-week-old hens from the affected fl ocks. The serological evidence of the egg drop syndrome virus infection was confirmed by detection of the presence of the virus genome in the turkey sera by the polymerase chain reaction. Vaccination of the 18- and 25-week-old turkey hens against the egg drop syndrome virus started in March 2003. After this period, the presence of antibodies to the egg drop syndrome virus (the haemagglutination inhibition titres between 16 and 256) was found in 96.7% of the analysed sera, while the egg production reached normal or higher values for the Nicholas hybrid line of turkeys.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the effects of four essential oils intake by feed, namely Origanum vulgare , Thymus vulgaris , Cinnamomum zeylanicum Ness , and Syzygium aromaticum on antioxidant status in mice in vivo . Essential oils were in the aether oleum form. They were diluted with ethanol absolute mixed with ground pelett (0.1, 0.25, 0.57 and 1% concentration) and thereafter ethanol was evaporated. SOD, GPx activities and TAS were measured in erythrocytes and plasma spectrophotometrically with Ransod, Ransel and TAS kits from RANDOX, respectively. GPX activity showed a significant increase in 0.25% and 0.1% concentration of Origani aetheroleum . The GPx activities were decreased in 1% concentration of Thymi aetheroleum and 0.57% concentration of Cinnamomi aetheroleum and 0.57% concentration of Caryophylli aetheroleum . The total antioxidant status showed a significant decrease in 1 % concentration of Origani aetheroleum and significantly increased in 0.1% concentration. The same results were found in Thymi aetheroleum . Cinnamomi aetheroleum and Caryophylli aetheroleum had not effect on total antioxidant status. SOD activities were not significantly changed after intake of essential oils. In conclusion, our results showed, that concentration of essential oil is very important for antioxidant status and also for metabolism of mice, because a high dose of essential oil has adverse effect on metabolism of mice, representated by a lower growth of the body weight. On the other hand, essential oils at lower concentrations have positive effect on antioxidant status of mice.",

In this work, the effects of tilmicosin were evaluated with respect to alterations in total sialic acid, malondialdehyde and glutathione content of the heart, liver, kidney and lung tissues after single subcutaneous injection of 75 mg/kg tilmicosin with or without L-carnitine (500 mg/kg for 5 days daily via s.c. route) in BALB/c mice. L-carnitine is a co-factor serving in the mitochondrial β-oxidation of long chain fatty acids, and it was reported to be protective in several types of toxicity cases probably via multi-factorial mechanisms. Twenty eight mice were divided into 4 groups including group 1 (control), group 2 (L-carnitine), group 3 (tilmicosin) and group 4 (tilmicosin plus L-carnitine). Following the administration of treatments, tissue samples were collected, and the samples were assayed for malondialdehyde, glutathione and total sialic acid content. Mice receiving tilmicosin treatment alone had significantly higher malondialdehyde and total sialic acid concentrations (except for MDA of lungs) but lower glutathione concentration in selected tissues compared to those of the control, group 2 (Carnitine only) and group 4 (L-carnitine plus tilmicosin) ( p &lt; 0.05). However, no significant difference was found associated with the assayed indicators between the control and mice treated with L-carnitine plus tilmicosin. These results suggest that tilmicosin may cause oxidative stress in the heart, liver, lung and kidneys, but the adverse effects could be attenuated by L-carnitine administration.",

On average, left femurs with a damaged distal physis and preventively transplanted allogeneic MSCs (Group A) grew during 4 months from transplantation by 0.56 ± 0.44 cm more than right femurs without the transplantation of MSCs, whereas left femurs with physeal defects treated with a therapeutic transplantation of allogeneic MSCs (Group B) by 0.14 ± 0.72 cm only, compared to right femurs without transplanted MSCs. Four months after preventive transplantation of MSCs (Group A), valgus deformity of the distal part of left femur with the defect was 0.78 ± 0.82°; in the control group (right femur in the same animal without MSCs transplantation) it was 3.7 ± 0.82°. After therapeutic transplantation of MSCs (Group B) 0.6 ± 3.4°, in the control group (right femur in the same animal without MSCs transplantation) it was 2.1 ± 2.9°. In all the animals of Groups A and B, the presence of newly formed hyaline cartilage was confirmed histologically and immunohistochemically. In the distal physis of right femurs with an iatrogenic defect of the growth cartilage without the transplantation of MSCs (control) bone bridge was formed. Preventive transplantation of allogeneic MSCs into the defect of the distal growth zone of femur appears more suitable compared to the therapeutic transplantation, with regard to the more pronounced lengthwise bone growth. Differences found in the extent of valgus deformity were non-significant comparing preventive and therapeutic transplantations of MSCs.",

One-day-old chickens (Ross 308, mixed sex) were randomly divided into control and experimental groups. Each group consisted of 36 birds, with 6 replications,and with 6 chickens per replication. The control group was fed the basal diet (consisting of maize and 40% of lupine), while the experimental treatment group was fed the basal diet supplemented with 0.06% commercial enzyme (Ronozyme VP). Chickens were fed diets in mash form for 4 weeks. Enzyme preparation significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) improved feed consumption and chicken growth, and slightly improved total tract digestibility of dietary ingredients and energy. Enzyme preparation significantly reduced ( P &lt; 0.05) the size of gastrointestinal tract organs and had an impact on jejunal mucous membrane of chickens evidenced by elongation of villi and deepening of crypts. No significant effects of dietary enzyme on counts of the analysed bacteria in the jejunal digesta were observed, but enzyme preparation significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) reduced the number of Enterobacteriaceae in caeca and excreta, and coliforms in excreta only ( P &lt; 0.01). Appropriate combination of enzyme preparations with activity towards degrading carbohydrates may offer a potential to reduce the deleterious impact of lupine in broilers.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of sex on histochemical and morphometrical characteristics of muscle fibres (myocytes) in this pure breed and to verify the presence of giant fibres as well as vascularity of the muscle. Finally, maximum shortening velocity and isometric tension were measured in single muscle fibres. Sixteen Casertana pigs (8 males, 8 females) from a farm in Campania (Italy) were slaughtered at one year of age. Muscle tissues were obtained from psoas minor, rhomboideus and longissimus dorsi. Myofibres were stained for myosin adenosine triphosphatase, succinic dehydrogenase, and α-amylase-periodic acid schiff. For all fibre types, the area and perimeter were measured. Slowtwitch oxidative fibres, fast-twitch glycolytic fibres and fast-twitch oxidative-glycolytic fibres were histochemically differentiated; an image-analyzing system was used. The results showed significant differences between the sexes in the size of all three fibre types. The psoas minor muscle had a high percentage of slow-twitch oxidative fibres and contained more capillaries per fibre and per mm 2 than rhomboideus and longissimus dorsi, in which fast-twitch glycolytic fibres dominated. The cross-sectional area of all fibre types was larger in longissimus dorsi than in rhomboideus and psoas minor muscles; the giant fibres were present in the longissimus dorsi muscle only. Besides, isometric tension values were higher in fast-twitch glycolytic fibres than in the other ones. Variations in fibre type composition may contribute to meat quality.",

The experiment was carried out on a farm with Czech Fleckvieh dairy cows. We formed an experimental group (E), supplied with mineral lick ad libitum enhanced with organic forms of microelements (Se, Zn, Cu, Mn) for four to five weeks before parturition and 1 week after parturition. The control group (C) did not receive any mineral lick. The use of mineral lick by cows was very uneven, its total consumption oscillated between 0 to 250 g of lick per animal per day. Lick feeding did not result in evidential increase of concentrations of monitored microelements in the cows’ blood, colostrum and milk. Only a tendency to increased concentrations of Se and Cu in the blood of group E of cows was observed; the average Se concentration increased by 60 μg l -1 (Cu by 9 μmol l -1 ), whereas in group C, Se increased only by 30 μg l -1 (Cu by 6 μg l -1 ). The concentration of microelements in colostrum after parturition dropped quickly. Significant drops were determined for Se, Cu and Zn on the first (for Mn on the second) day after parturition. Selenium concentration in the first colostrum was 5 times higher than in milk, Cu concentration 3 times higher, Zn concentration 4 times higher and Mn concentration 1.3 times higher.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the study was to assess the safety of forage prepared from selected grass species by means of the analysis of ergosterol and zearalenone. Graminaceous plants studied at the end of their growing season were Festulolium , Dactylis glomerata and Arrhenatherum elatius . Other indicators assessed were the content of ergosterol and zearalenone during the autumn and the intensity of grassland use in the summer season as related to the studied contents of metabolites. Grasslands were harvested either in October, November or December. The secondary metabolites were analyzed by means of high performance liquid chromatography. At the end of the growing season, the ergosterol content was the lowest in the Festulolium forage (110.04 mg kg -1 ), the highest contents were observed in the Dactylis glomerata and Arrhenatherum elatius forages (145.73 mg kg -1 and 139.55 mg kg -1 , respectively). The safety of Festulolium was also corroborated by the low zearalenone content (0.357 mg kg -1 ). On the other hand, the high ergosterol content in Arrhenatherum elatius was combined with a high content of zearalenone (1.554 mg kg -1 ). Although Dactylis glomerata exhibited an ergosterol content comparable with that of Arrhenatherum elatius forage, its zearalenone content was comparable to the Festulolium forage. Among the three species under study we found a significant difference ( P &lt; 0.01) in the ergosterol and zearalenone contents. Changes in the ergosterol and zearalenone contents were also apparent from October to December. The highest ( P &lt; 0.01) content of ergosterol was found in December (254.26 mg kg -1 ). The higher ( P &lt; 0.01) zearalenone content in this month (1.588 mg kg -1 ) was caused by the Arrhenatherum elatius forage. Moreover, the contents of ergosterol and zearalenone were affected ( P &lt; 0.01) also by the number of cuts in summer. The higher ergosterol content indicated a higher forage infestation by fungi and the inherent risk of the occurrence of mycotoxins. However, the high ergosterol content not always correlated with the high content of zearalenone. When cattle is grazing in winter, a higher occurrence of mycotoxins in the feed may be expected and the related damage to animal metabolism may increase the number of diseased animals with consequent impact on animal production, performance and health and animal husbandry economics.",

    "abstract": "Resistance of staphylococci to methicillin is important especially in the case of Staphylococcus aureus isolates. Its impact in veterinary medicine is not exactly specified in coagulase-negative staphylococci; however, these staphylococci may represent an important reservoir of resistance genes. The study aimed at detecting resistance to methicillin in coagulase-negative staphylococci from raw materials and foodstuffs of animal origin and assessing the tests frequently used to determine this resistance. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (198 isolates of 12 species) were tested. Resistance to methicillin was determined by the disk diffusion method using oxacillin and cefoxitin disks, microdilution method, detection of PBP2a and the mecA gene. Of the tested isolates, 109 (55.1%) were classified as resistant by the diffusion test with oxacillin, 32 isolates (16.2%) by the test with cefoxitin and 50 isolates (25.3%) on the basis of oxacillin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). No resistant isolates were incorrectly identified as susceptible when using the disk diffusion method with oxacillin (sensitivity of 100%). However, apart from 22 correctly classified resistant isolates, another 87 isolates were incorrectly identified as resistant as well (specificity of 50.6%). The test with cefoxitin showed the lowest (45.5%) sensitivity in determination of resistant isolates. By contrast, this test was the most precise in classification of resistant isolates (specificity of 87.5%). When using the microdilution method, resistant strains were identified with the sensitivity and specificity of 68.2% and 80.1%, respectively. The results revealed substantial variability of methicillin-resistant isolates ranging from 16.2% to 55.1%, depending on the phenotyping methods and recommended interpretation criteria used. Therefore, it is advisable to reconsider the current interpretation criteria in the case of coagulasenegative staphylococci of animal origin (with the exception of S. epidermidis ).",

Fish (n = 72) were exposed for 14 days to elevated nitrite concentration (1 mg·l -1 ). Thereafter the exposed fish were divided into four groups and monitored for 7 days in the following conditions: water containing 1 mg·l -1 NO 2 (group E), water containing 1 mg·l -1 NO 2 - + 100 mg·l -1 Cl - (group R1), nitrite-free water with 100 mg·l -1 Cl - (group R2), or nitrite- and chloride-free water (group R3). Nitrite exposure was associated with a significant increase ( P &lt; 0.01) in methaemoglobin, mean corpuscular haemoglobin and plasma nitrite concentration. During the subsequent 7 days these indices reached the control values in all recovery groups (R1–R3). Significant decrease ( P &lt; 0.01) in haematocrit and mean corpuscular volume was recorded during nitrite exposure of fish. These changes were eliminated by addition of chloride to the water. Other haematological and biochemical blood indices showed that all treatments resulted in moderate stress to fish with the least pronounced changes in group R1. Results of the present study confirmed that even low nitrite concentrations may cause physiological changes in rainbow trout and pointed to possible recovery treatments of fish impaired by nitrite exposure. One of the most important findings is that chloride added to the water leads to successful fish recovery even in the presence of nitrite.",

In February 2004, two Siberian tiger ( Panthera tigris altaica ) cubs at the age of six months died at the Zagreb ZOO. The animals were presented for necropsy with two days history of severe digestive disorders, characterized mainly by haemathemesis. Dissections revealed catarrhal to pseudomembranous gastroenteritis (depending on the animal) accompanied with haemorrhagic oedema of the lungs. Necrotic tonsillitis and disseminated depletion of the lymphocytes were the most prominent histological findings in both examined animals, while intranuclear and intracytoplasmatic inclusion bodies were found in the samples of the tongues and intestines. Representative portions of the livers, intestines, tonsils and lymph nodes were submitted for bacteriological and mycological analysis. The presence of Clostridium spp., Campylobacter coli and Escherichia coli was detected in gut samples, coli-like bacteria were found in samples of liver, tonsils and lymph nodes, while Candida sp. was found in the gut and pharynx samples. Toxicological analysis excluded anticoagulant and organophosphorous intoxication as the cause of death. Immunohistochemical analysis was positive for canine distemper virus. Based on all this, epizootiological, clinical and additional findings, canine distemper was recognized as the cause of the observed condition in these animals.",

A total of 22 goat kids were divided into 4 groups of 5 or 6 animals. Goats and kids from the control group did not receive any additional zinc, the second group was supplemented with inorganic zinc (zinc oxide), the third group was given zinc lactate, and the fourth group received chelated zinc. Samples of kids’ faeces were taken weekly from 3 to 9 weeks of their age (a total of 7 samples were taken). Samples of faeces were examined by a quantitative method to detect the number of oocysts. Kids were weighed weekly and their blood was taken in order to determine zinc concentrations in blood plasma. Animals from the group supplemented with zinc chelate and zinc lactate shed a significantly ( p ≤ 0.05) lower number of oocysts (13.4% and 11.9%, respectively) compared to the number of oocyst shed by control and zinc oxide supplemented groups (25% and 49.7%, respectively). Shedding of oocysts was not accompanied by clinical symptoms of coccidiosis in any of the groups. Kids supplemented with zinc chelate showed significantly highest weight gains and blood plasma concentration of zinc ( p ≤ 0.05) as compared to control and inorganic zinc supplemented groups. Organic zinc is to be recommended to be used as a prophylaxis against coccidiosis in goat kids.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate molecular multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (multiplex PCR) test as an alternative for serologic Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method in diagnosing bovine leukaemia virus infections and found possible differences in milk yield in seronegative and seropositive cows. The study involved two groups of Polish Holstein-Friesian var. black and white cows (a total of 147 individuals). Animals were grouped according to their serological response to the bovine leukaemia virus antigen: control group of 71 healthy cows and second group of 76 naturally infected animals. Both multiplex PCR and ELISA proved to be very sensitive methods with sensitivity up to 100% and 97.4%, respectively. Negative effect of bovine leukaemia virus on milk yield was observed. Leucosis-free cows achieved higher milk yield (+ 322.9 kg; P ≤ 0.01), protein yield (+ 5.2 kg, P ≤ 0.05), and better milk yield after calculation into daily milk yield corrected for fat (+ 106.6 kg, P ≤ 0.05) in comparison to seropositive cows. In infected cows a significantly higher ( P ≤ 0.01) fat content (4.1%) was recorded. Because ELISA test does not provide information of the infection at an early stage and is not sensitive enough to detect every infected animal, a two-step protocol allows for elimination of seropositive animals and restriction of their introduction into herds in Europe.",

Milk samples were taken separately from each cow, 18 samples from one farm. A total of 90 milk samples were taken. Cows were in three age classes (lactation number): 1, 2-3 and &gt;3, and four lactation periods (duration): ): ≤ 100, 101–200, 201–305 and &gt; 305 days). The concentration of trace elements in milk was determined using atomic absorption spectrometry method. Average concentrations of the elements in 1 kg of fresh milk were the following: iron 173 ± 84 µg, zinc 3.6 ± 0.9 mg, manganese 27 ± 17 µg and copper 40 ± 23 µg. A relation between the age of cows and the concentrations of iron was observed. The lowest contents of iron (145 ± 72 µg·kg -1 ) were observed in the milk from the youngest cows in their first lactation, whereas the highest contents (217 ± 70 µg·kg -1 ) were observed in the milk from the oldest cows above the third lactation. No relation between the age of cows and the concentrations of zinc, manganese and copper in milk was observed. Similarly, no significant differences between the contents of these elements in different lactation periods were observed. Study on factors influencing the concentrations of trace elements in cow milk were undertaken because researches on the subject are not numerous.",

The in vivo investigation was carried out on 120 heavy-line broilers (Arbor acres) of both sexes. One-day-old broilers were randomly distributed into 2 groups, each numbering 60 individuals of both sexes: Group 1 - control group; Group 2 - group of broilers inoculated with laboratory derived coccidia species on the 21 st day-of-age. When symptoms of coccidiosis appeared (30 th day-of-age), blood sampling and decapitation of 20 chickens were carried out (Group 2a). The remaining broilers were treated with therapeutic doses of sulphachloropyrazine (60 ppm). Decapitation of 20 chickens was carried out after the therapy was concluded (38 th day-of-age – Group 2b). Infection of broilers with coccidia intensified free radical processing in haemolysed blood and liver homogenate. This was evident from the increased levels of lipid peroxidation and the catalytic activity of almost all examined enzymes (SOD, GSHPx and Px). Therapeutic doses of sulphachloropyrazine inhibited free-radical activity induced by disease and establishing of physiological values of lipid peroxidation and catalase activity of examined enzymes.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to assess polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contamination on the Bílina River (the Czech Republic) by measurement of three PAH biliary metabolites in fish and 16 PAHs in passive samplers. A total of sixty-one fish were collected; the indicator species were chub ( Leuciscus cephalus L.; n = 25), roach ( Rutilus rutilus L . ; n = 17) and brown trout ( Salmo trutta m. fario L.; n = 19). Three biliary PAH metabolites were measured: 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP), 2-naphtol, and 1-hydroxyphenanthrene, but only 1-OHP was detected in all fish. The highest median value of 32.3 ng·mg -1 of 1-OHP was found at Ústí nad Labem, while the lowest median value of 27.6 ng·mg -1 was found in the control site, Březenec. No significant differences ( P &lt; 0.05) among the sites were found. The highest concentration of PAH was detected in Litvínov-Záluží (172.0 ng·l -1 ) and the lowest concentration (7.9 ng·l -1 ) was detected in Březenec. A positive, but non-significant correlation (r s = 0.8) was confirmed between biliary 1-OHP and total PAH in passive samplers. These results indicate the highest pollution in the middle stretches of the Bílina River, especially at Litvínov-Záluží. We confirmed 1-OHP as the most prevalent PAH biliary metabolite in fish that could be used as a biomarker for assessment of PAH pollution of the aquatic ecosystem. The main importance of the present study is in the combination of biochemical and chemical monitoring that provides complex evaluation of aquatic environment contamination. It was the first study on the Bílina River, in which the assessment of PAH contamination in the aquatic ecosystem was realized using combination of biotic and abiotic monitoring.",

General examination of the animal before slaughtering revealed no health problems. Blood was collected from jugular vein and serum was separated. Serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations were determined using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Uterine and oviduct samples were obtained from the buffalo after slaughter. These samples were processed routinely and stained with haematoxylin and eosin stain for histopathological examination. A corpus albicans together with a follicle in a diameter of 1.6 cm, located on the left ovary was detected during ultrasonographic examination performed in a water bath of the genital organs after slaughter. Serum oestrogen and progesterone concentrations were determined as 23 pg/ml and 0.53ng/ml, respectively. Cysts demonstrating multifocal serosal form of location in uterine horns were seen. Cysts similar to the uterine cysts were seen also in the oviduct. Cystic structures in a diameter ranging from 0.3 cm to 1 cm were observed in uterine horns, whereas cystic formations in a diameter ranging from 0.5 cm to 0.7 cm were seen in the mesosalpinx of the right and left oviducts. The cysts were surrounded by epithelium differing from a single layer of flat epithelium to cubic epithelium. This is the first study describing the oviduct cyst observed together with uterine serosal inclusion cysts in Anatolian water buffalo.",

    "abstract": "Successful reduction of death and euthanasia rates requires the determination of factors related to death and euthanasia of cats in shelters. In the period from 2011 to 2015, 474 cats died and 240 had to be euthanized for health reasons in the three cat shelters monitored in our study. Altogether, death was the ultimate outcome for 33% of the cats admitted in the shelters. Out of the cats that died, 67.3% cats died within the first month and 95.4% within 6 months of admission to the shelter. Similarly, 65.0% of all euthanized cats were euthanized within the first month and 88.3% were euthanized within 6 months of admission. Since the majority of mortalities occurred shortly after admission, they more probably resulted from the cats’ poor condition at the time of admission rather than from the shelter’s environment. Females and cats younger than 6 months were at an increased risk of mortality. Autumn and summer were the seasons with the majority of fatalities. In general, the number of cats that died was almost double the number of cats that were euthanized; this suggests that attempts to cure cats were favoured over euthanasia, even in cases of serious health problems. In the fields of cat welfare and veterinary healthcare, the results enable increased attention to be focused on the determined risk factors and thus are an important prerequisite for a successful solution to the problem of the high number of deaths and instances of euthanasia of cats in shelters.",

A 2.5-month-old female Labrador Retriever was referred to the Emergency Department following deliberate ingestion of a metaldehyde-containing granular bait. Severe continuous tonic-clonic activity, muscle tremors, loss of consciousness, diffuse congestion of the oral mucosa, tachycardia, tachypnoea and nystagmus were observed upon admission. Additional intravenous administration of a 20% lipid emulsion resulted in normalization of the vital signs and complete neurological recovery. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report describing ILE in the treatment of canine metaldehyde intoxication and the first description of a case of metaldehyde poisoning in a dog in Romania. Considering the severity of the neurological signs and the fact that no specific antidote is known, treatment can be significantly challenging to the veterinary practitioner. This finding should be included in metaldehyde poisoning therapy protocols, especially when severe clinical signs fail to respond to symptomatic treatment.",

    "abstract": "Foulbrood disease, which is caused by Paenibacillus larvae (American foulbrood) or Melissococcus plutonius (European foulbrood disease), is a major threat to honeybees ( Apis mellifera ) worldwide. Tetracycline derivatives have been used to control these bacteria, but resistant strains have evolved, and the antibiotic derivatives can adversely affect bee health. When foulbrood disease is discovered, beekeepers usually burn the bee hives and equipment. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro susceptibility of P. larvae and M. plutonius to new antibacterial agents. Antibacterial activities of seven compounds prepared as serial two-fold dilutions were assayed using 96-well microtitre plates. Minimum inhibitory concentration values were obtained after 24 h or 48 h of incubation. Antibacterial synergistic activity of tetracycline and the test compounds was evaluated using broth micro-dilution assays with two-fold serial dilutions of the compounds. Among the seven compounds tested, macelignan and corosolic acid showed the strongest anti-bacterial activity. In addition, tetracycline interacted synergistically with corosolic acid to reduce P. larvae and M. plutonius growth. Even though macelignan and corosolic acid were worth as solely effective agents to treat P. larvae and M. plutonius , combinatorial treatment with tetracycline would be more useful to overcome toxicity, resistance occurrence and costliness. Further validation studies of these compounds and identification of their targets, as well as actual field tests and bee toxicity studies are still needed. However, macelignan and corosolic acid as natural secondary metabolites would be effective agents for bee foulbrood disease with valuable antibacterial activities.",

The contents of crude protein, pure protein, fat, collagen, dry matter and ash were determined in each sample. The effect of locality, age and sex on the chemical properties of the wild boar meat was studied with the use of statistical analysis. The values obtained for the chemical composition of the muscle tissue of the wild boar from localities A and B corresponded to the results obtained in other countries. The protein content fell within the range of 20.49–21.26% at locality A and 18.77–20.34% at locality B. The fat content fell within the wide range of 0.83–2.38% (0.83–1.67% at locality A and 1.51–2.38% at locality B). It is clear from the statistical evaluation that wild boar hunted in the enclosed locality had a significantly higher ( P &lt; 0.05) fat content and a lower content of crude ( P &lt; 0.05) and pure ( P &lt; 0.05) protein in comparison with wild boar from the unenclosed locality.

    "abstract": "The assessment of cadmium content in the muscle, liver and kidneys of fattening pigs and sows was conducted in the Czech Republic during the period of 2015–2019. The samples were collected from a total of 32 sows and 210 fattening pigs. The mean cadmium content in the livers and kidneys of all sows was 0.102 ± 0.010 and 0.361 ± 0.032 mg·kg -1 , respectively. The mean cadmium content in the livers and kidneys of all fattening pigs was 0.028 ± 0.001 and 0.141 ± 0.005 mg·kg -1 , respectively. The maximum residual limit for human consumption was not exceeded in any sample. The cadmium content in the liver did not differ significantly between sows and fattening pigs in any particular year. In contrast, the cadmium content in kidneys differed significantly between sows and fattening pigs, being higher in sows ( P &lt; 0.05). No significant decreasing trend was observed for the cadmium content in tissues during the whole time period. It can be concluded that there is a need for further monitoring of the cadmium content in pig tissues in the Czech Republic.",

    "abstract": "Flesh and fatty acid compositions, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), lipid oxidation and aerobic plate count, Enterobacteriaceae , psychrotrophic bacteria were determined in raw and smoked mackerel during cold storage (three groups differing in way of packaging; unpacked (UP), vacuum packaging (VP) and modified atmosphere (MAP) at 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 days. The protein, fat content and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids increased after smoking. The pH value and TVB-N were significantly higher in unpacked mackerel. Initial malondialdehyde concentration in raw mackerel was lowered after smoking and then lipid oxidation was the most pronounced in unpacked mackerel. Hot smoking, vacuum packaging, and modified atmosphere reduced bacterial growth, while the microbial contamination in all groups was below the limits during the whole period of storage. However, physicochemical properties of unpacked mackerel exceeded the limits from day 35 on. The present study indicates a lowering of products of secondary lipid oxidation after smoking followed by accelerated lipid degradation during cold storage of unpacked smoked mackerel. It is suggested that the smoking process and appropriate packaging method can protect lipids as well as valuable polyunsaturated fatty acids from oxidation. Vacuum packaging and modified atmosphere ensured microbial quality and protein and lipid stability. Their use is recommended for extending the shelf life of smoked fish considering the initial microbial and also chemical quality before and after smoking.",

    "abstract": "The colour and viscosity of egg yolk are among major indicators assessed by consumers and food technology. This study attempts to evaluate the colour and viscosity of yolk in laying hens’ eggs after the addition of dried beetroot ( Beta vulgaris L. ssp. esculenta var. rubra ) at the amount of 1% and 2% per feeding dose (in July and August 2012). The experiment was performed on 24 hens that were divided into three groups of 8 laying hens. The preparatory phase lasted one week (standard diet), followed by four weeks during which experimental layers received a diet enriched with beetroot. Then, all layers were fed a mixture without beetroot for the following four weeks. Eggs were collected during the whole period of 8 weeks. In total, 30 eggs from each group were subjected to analysis. The colour of eggs was determined using spectrophotometry, by the Colour-guide sphere spex portable colorimeter. The results showed a significant ( P &lt; 0.05) increase in value L* of yolk colour in experimental groups whereas values a* and b* (indicators of the international colorimetric scale CIELAB) did not vary significantly. Similarly, specific purity C* ab did not show a significant difference ( P &lt; 0.05) between the control and experimental groups. The egg yolk viscosity was lower in experimental groups compared to the control group but the difference was not significant. The addition of dried beetroot at the amount of 1 and 2% per feeding dose had no effect on colour and viscosity. This paper supported the null hypothesis that the addition of dried beetroot to the feeding dose at the amount of 1% and 2% has no effect on the colour and viscosity of egg yolk.",

    "abstract": "Aquaculture represents the fastest growing animal husbandry in many countries. However, higher intensity of fish farming can pose higher health hazards, too. We monitored the health status of fish from one fish farm in South Bohemia and discovered the main health problems in the breeding. For two years we examined a total of 224 specimens of brook trout ( Salvelinus fontinalis ), 126 specimens of hybrids ( S. fontinalis × S. alpinus ), 49 specimens of rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) – all clinically healthy, and 100 clinically diseased or freshly dead fish. We registered skin erosions mainly in the caudal peduncle and tail fin. Two parasite species were identified (one protist Ichthyophthirius multifiliis and one nematode Raphidascaris acus ) by parasitological examination. The epidemiological indicators of I. multifiliis were low. The prevalence of adult R. acus was 0–86% with a maximum in June. From November, capsules with larval stages of R. acus appeared in internal organs. Their highest intensity (200 pieces) and prevalence (100%) were detected in October. By microbiological examination of skin and gills, we identified changes in the density of bacterial population and its species composition dependent on water temperature and fish density. The most important problem on the monitored fish farm seems to be furunculosis of salmonid fish in all clinical forms, and the high intensity of larval stages of R. acus . The originality of this study is based on the fact that the observed breeding employs the first Danish recirculation system in the Czech Republic and no recent information about health problems has been available.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the quality of lamb meat has been regarded with attention to the content of intramuscular fat, and its fatty acid profile. These indicators are determined by the feed administered to the animals. Apparently, the type of silage used in animal nutrition may be important. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of feeding lambs with silages produced from different plant species on selected meat quality traits. The experiment was conducted on 24 ram lambs, divided into 3 equal groups fed with red clover silage, alfalfa silage, and grass silage, respectively. After 60 days of fattening, the lambs were slaughtered. Samples collected from musculus longissimus lumborum were assayed for: contents of intramuscular fat, cholesterol, the vitamins retinol and α-tocopherol, and the fatty acid profile of intramuscular fat. The meat of lambs fed red clover silage was characterized by a higher content of fat compared to lambs receiving grass silage ( P ≤ 0.05). The concentration of vitamin E in the group fed grass silage was the highest and differed significantly ( P ≤ 0.01) compared to the group fed alfalfa silage. Intramuscular fat of lambs fed red clover silage contained more polyunsaturated fatty acids n-3 and was characterized by a lower ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids n-6:n-3 compared to the lambs fed grass silage. The concentration of conjugated linoleic acid was higher in lambs fed grass silage compared to fat of lambs from the other groups ( P ≤ 0.05). Feeding lambs with silages produced from various plant species had a positive effect on traits characterizing the health quality of meat. Until now, only a few studies have been conducted in this species; this is the first such comprehensive study in sheep.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this review was to summarize new genetic approaches and techniques in the breeding of cattle, pigs, sheep and horses. Often production and reproductive traits are treated separately in genetic evaluations, but advantages may accrue to their joint evaluation. A good example is the system in pig breeding. Simplified breeding objectives are generally no longer appropriate and consequently becoming increasingly complex. The goal of selection for improved animal performance is to increase the profit of the production system; therefore, economic selection indices are now used in most livestock breeding programmes. Recent developments in dairy cattle breeding have focused on the incorporation of molecular information into genetic evaluations and on increasing the importance of longevity and health in breeding objectives to maximize the change in profit. For a genetic evaluation of meat yield (beef, pig, sheep), several types of information can be used, including data from performance test stations, records from progeny tests and measurements taken at slaughter. The standard genetic evaluation method of evaluation of growth or milk production has been the multi-trait animal model, but a test-day model with random regression is becoming the new standard, in sheep as well. Reviews of molecular genetics and pedigree analyses for performance traits in horses are described. Genome – wide selection is becoming a world standard for dairy cattle, and for other farm animals it is under development.",

    "abstract": "Lumbosacral transitional vertebra is a common congenital anomaly of the spine in dogs. It is a predisposing factor for degeneration of the lumbosacral spine and development of cauda equina syndrome or hip dysplasia in affected dogs. The aim of the study was to determine breed predisposition, types, and prevalence of lumbosacral transitional vertebrae in the canine population in the Czech Republic. The value of laterolateral radiographs of the lumbosacral junction in the diagnosis of LTV was also evaluated. Prevalence of lumbosacral transitional vertebrae was determined by reviewing ventrodorsal radiographs of pelvis with an extended hip of 1,878 dogs. Lumbosacral transitional vertebrae were detected in 188 dogs (10%). German Shepherd, Alaskan Malamute and Bohemian Shepherd were found to be highly predisposed breeds. The most common type of lumbosacral transitional vertebra was type II with separation of the first sacral vertebra from sacrum and presence of rudimentary intervertebral space between S1 and the sacral median crest (37.8% of the lumbosacral transitional vertebrae). Type I was detected in 29.2% and the asymmetric type of the lumbosacral transitional vertebra (type III) in 33%. Laterolateral radiograph of the lumbosacral spine was evaluated in 126 dogs from 188 with lumbosacral transitional vertebrae. Rudimentary intervertebral disc space between S1 and S2 in laterolateral radiographs was detected in 100% of lumbosacral transitional vertebrae with type II and III, and was not detected in type I. The findings on lumbosacral transitional vertebrae in the Czech Republic will extend knowledge about the disease. Both ventrodorsal hip-extended and laterolateral radiographs should be recommended for routine screening and reliable differentiation among the three different types of lumbosacral transitional vertebra.",

In total, 1,250 freshly hatched nauplii of A. franciscana were used in the study. They were placed in 125 Petri dishes (10 nauplii in one Petri dish) containing 10 ml of azoxystrobin, glyphosate, cadmium chloride, potassium dichromate and zinc sulphate separately, or their combinations; the control dish contained only sea water. Each experimental set consisted of 50 nauplii which were divided into five replicates of 10 nauplii per replicate.

Nine clinically healthy calves were used in this study. The first blood sampling was performed before the colostrum intake (day 0) and then at 1, 2, 7, 14, 30, 60, and 90 days of age. Blood serum was analyzed for the concentrations of α 1 -fetoprotein, prealbumin, transferrin, and lactoferrin. The results showed significant changes in the serum concentrations of all the evaluated proteins in calves during the first three months of life ( P &lt; 0.01 and P &lt; 0.001). At birth, the mean concentration of α 1 -fetoprotein was low and increased more than × 8 at one day after colostrum intake, then a gradual decrease was found up to day 30 of life. Similar tendency was observed in the concentrations of prealbumin and lactoferrin. While the concentrations of prealbumin increased approximately × 3.5 at one day after colostrum intake, the serum lactoferrin values showed approximately 1.5-fold increase. A subsequent gradual decrease from the 2 nd day of life was found for both prealbumin and lactoferrin. In the concentrations of transferrin, a significant increase was observed on day 7 ( P &lt; 0.05). The highest values were found at the age of 14 and 30 days. These results suggest that concentrations of these proteins in calves are markedly altered during the postnatal period, which should be taken into consideration for their precise interpretation in young animals.",

Over 33% of the cows were found to be clean, with more of them in the free-stall barn. Analysis of the cleanliness of body parts showed that the highest hygiene level was characteristic of the udders and underbelly (scores of 1 for 47% and 56% of the cows, respectively). In the free-stall barn, there were over twice as many cows with clean udders (58%) and almost twice as few cows with very dirty udders. Regardless of the housing system, the degree of udder dirtiness created differences ( P ≤ 0.01) in the natural log somatic cell count. The natural log somatic cell count increased from 11.54 to 12.37 on average with increased dirtiness of the udder. Greater differences in the cytological quality of milk were found in cows housed in the free-stall system. When analysing the effect of overall dirtiness of the cows and the body parts on the percentage of SCC classes, it was found that highest quality milk (&lt; 200 000 somatic cells/ml) was produced by clean cows (71.52%). The proportion of cows with subclinical and clinical mastitis was found to increase with decreasing cleanliness of the udder, especially in the free-stall system. Overall, the proportion of cows with clinical mastitis increased from 2.51% (clean cows) to 14.29% (dirty cows).",

In the context of previous studies, we managed to create and keep a wide collection of cell lines from European bat species. Liver cells were chosen for testing, as they represent the preferred model for toxicological studies. Bats are protected, cell lines replacing experimental animals thus represent a unique opportunity to examine effects of pollutants which animals are exposed to in their environments. Moreover, cell incubation temperature variation may simulate physiological states of heterothermic bats. Liver cell lines were cultivated to the required cell number. Exposure to five different concentrations of permethrin (PM) and imidacloprid (IMI) were used to determine cytotoxic effects of these pesticides on Nyctalus noctula -derived liver cells cultivated at 37 °C and 8 °C for 24 h. An assay based on the measurement of activity of lactate dehydrogenase released from damaged cells was used for quantitating cytotoxicity. Cytotoxicity of IMI ranged from 0% to 47% and from 56% to 67% at 37 °C and 8 °C, respectively. Cytotoxicity of PM ranged from 36% to 56% and from 43% to 88% at 37 °C and 8 °C, respectively. Permethrin was tested on the cells at an order of magnitude lower concentrations; even so, higher degree of cytotoxicity was recorded.

    "abstract": "The use of point of care diagnostics (POCD) in animal diseases has steadily increased over the years since its introduction. Its potential application to diagnose infectious diseases in remote and resource limited settings have made it an ideal diagnostic in animal disease diagnosis and surveillance. The rapid increase in incidence of emerging infectious diseases requires urgent attention where POCD could be indispensable tools for immediate detection and early warning of a potential pathogen. The advantages of being rapid, easily affordable and the ability to diagnose an infectious disease on spot has driven an intense effort to refine and build on the existing technologies to generate advanced POCD with incremental improvements in analytical performance to diagnose a broad spectrum of animal diseases. The rural communities in developing countries are invariably affected by the burden of infectious animal diseases due to limited access to diagnostics and animal health personnel. Besides, the alarming trend of emerging and transboundary diseases with pathogen spill-overs at livestock-wildlife interfaces has been identified as a threat to the domestic population and wildlife conservation. Under such circumstances, POCD coupled with non-invasive sampling techniques could be successfully deployed at field level without the use of sophisticated laboratory infrastructures. This review illustrates the current and prospective POCD for existing and emerging animal diseases, the status of non-invasive sampling strategies for animal diseases, and the tremendous potential of POCD to uplift the status of global animal health care.",

    "abstract": "This study focused on finding new information regarding the assessment of pig saliva cortisol samples in terms of practical effects of the sampling, sample storage conditions, and their laboratory analysis. The study was divided into two experiments. The first experiment was focused on finding the effect of sampling time on cortisol concentrations in pig saliva. The second experiment was focused on determining the effect of storage conditions on the value of salivary cortisol. Before the initiation of the study, we tested which one of the commercially available ELISA kits would be the most suitable for our experiments. Simultaneously, we carried out a pre-study to evaluate the effect of relocation and change in the housing type on the concentration of salivary cortisol in gestating sows. The samples were obtained by oral cavity swabbing, using a standard cotton swab. In the first study, piglets were examined at the age of 4 ± 1 days, and breeding management routine procedures were used as a stress factor. In the second study, the piglets were examined immediately after weaning (at 28 ± 2 days of age). The Cortisol EIA kit was found to be statistically more accurate and thus a more suitable ELISA kit for our experiment. Analysis of the relocation effect and the effect of change in the housing type showed that relocation does not seem to be a stress factor for gestating sows as no significant changes were observed in salivary cortisol concentration ( P &gt; 0.5); however, the change in the housing type lead to a significant increase in salivary cortisol ( P &lt; 0.001). In the first study, we determined using the ELISA method that the most significant difference occurred in 40 min ( P &lt; 0.01), which suggests that the best time for a sampling in order to assess salivary cortisol concentration is 40 min after stress induction by routine procedures. The conclusion of the second study was that in the monitored period of 60 h ( P &lt; 0.05), cortisol concentration decreased depending on the storage temperature. The decrease started between 48 and 60 h which showed that cortisol is stable in the saliva sample for at least 48 h. These findings will be further applied in our following studies focused on assessment of salivary cortisol concentration after stress induction.",

    "abstract": "A variety of stressful situations commonly occur on dairy farms which can impair the well-being of the animals. The aim of this study was to analyse the concentration of cortisol in the saliva of dairy goats and on the basis thereof to determine the degree of stress experienced by them in relation to selected situations on farms. The following situations were selected as stressful: first visit to the milking parlour; weaning off; loading and transport; deworming; and the disruption of social hierarchy. We examined 344 samples from 100 animals using cotton swabs for the saliva collection. Commercially available ELISA kits (Cortisol EIA Kit, BosterBio, California, USA) which can detect cortisol in the saliva of all animal species, were used for the analysis. During the first visit to the milking parlour, weaning off, deworming and disruption of social hierarchy there was a significant ( P &lt; 0.05) increase in cortisol concentrations compared to the basal values. For loading and transport there was a highly significant ( P &lt; 0.01) increase in cortisol concentrations compared to the basal values. Although these situations are inevitable on farms, efforts should be made to eliminate them as much as possible due to the stress the animals experience in them.",

The present study was aimed to identify selected important bacterial pathogens in the abortion cases of sheep. A total of 113 samples (105 aborted sheep foetuses, 4 placentas, and 4 vaginal swab samples) from 85 different sheep flocks were examined by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) regarding Chlamydia ( C. ) spp., C. abortus , Brucella ( B .) spp., B. melitensis , Salmonella ( S. ) spp., S. Abortusovis, Coxiella ( C. ) burnetii , Listeria ( L .) spp., L. monocytogenes , and Campylobacter spp. All cases that were found to be positive for bacterial agents by RT-PCR, were examined pathologically. Tissue samples of foetuses that were found to be positive for B. melitensis and L. monocytogenes by RT-PCR were also investigated immunohistochemically. A total of 35 (30.9%) samples were found to be positive by RT-PCR, with 15 (42.8%), 9 (25.7%), 5 (14.2%), 4 (11.4%), 1 (2.8%), and 1 (2.8%) of them being identified as C. abortus , B. melitensis , S. Abortusovis, C. burnetii , L. monocytogenes and Campylobacter spp., respectively. The presence of the antigen was confirmed also immunohistochemically in the cases with B. melitensis and L. monocytogenes . As a consequence, C. abortus was found to cause the highest rate of sheep abortion cases, which should be taken into account when implementing control measures in epidemiological investigations.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the foetal sex related difference and progression in maternal serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and equine chorionic gonadotrophin (eCG) concentrations during different points of time in pregnant Arabian mares. The study groups formed by 12 healthy male offspring- and 12 healthy female offspring-foaling mares, designated as group MFM and group FFM, respectively. Peripheral blood samples were collected on the day of natural mating and then monthly until the 6 th month (mo) of gestation. Serum AMH was measured in all serum samples; eCG was measured in samples collected from 2 to 5 months Of gestation. Serum AMH concentrations of group FFM at mo 4 and mo 5 (3.89 ± 0.49 ng/ml; 2.89 ± 0.32 ng/ml), were significantly higher than in group MFM (2.11 ± 0.46 ng/ml; 1.87 ± 0.32 ng/ml), ( P &lt; 0.05). The mo of gestation (mo 1–6) had no effect on serum AMH concentrations of either group MMF or FFM ( P &gt; 0.05). Serum eCG concentrations of group FFM at mo 2 (359.73 ± 41.51 mIU/ml), were significantly higher than in group MFM (255 ± 21.18 mIU/ml) ( P &lt; 0.05). Group-time interaction for eCG concentrations at mo 2–4 was non-significant ( P &gt; 0.05). Concentrations of serum AMH showed no relationship with corresponding eCG levels at mo 2–4 ( P &gt; 0.05). Individual variations in AMH and eCG concentrations and the inability to determine a cut-off point for determination of foetal sex make these hormones unlikely candidates for determining foetal sex in the mare.",

    "abstract": "Ten adult domestic shorthaired stray cats ( Felis catus ) were investigated for the presence and localization of different species of gastric Helicobacter -like organisms (GHLOs) using Warthin-Starry silver staining, immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM); the severity and distribution of lesions in different regions of the stomach were assessed in HE-stained sections. GHLOs were present in all areas of the stomach in all of 10 cats. Three morphologically different types of spiral-shaped bacteria were demonstrated; in silver-stained sections, H. pylori like organisms (HPLO) were easily differentiated from other GHLOs. Eight of the cats had H. heilmannii -like organisms (HHLOs) and one cat had HPLO. Mixed H. heilmannii and H. felis infection was seen in only one cat. GHLO infection was associated with a mild to severe gastritis in 8 of 10 cats. GHLOs colonized the cardia, corpus and antrum in similar density. The most striking histopathological changes consisted of accumulation of lymphocytes and neutrophilic granulocytes, fibrosis of the lamina propria mucosae, lymphoid follicles and lymphocytic infiltrates. There was no obvious relation between the degree of colonization by GHLOs and the extent of histopathological changes. GHLOs were present on the mucosal surface, in the lumen of gastric glands, and in the cytoplasm of parietal cells. These findings indicate that immunohistochemistry and silver staining are useful for detecting GHLO infections, particularly with different Helicobacter species present. Stray cats are frequently colonized by HHLOs without any significant correlation between the degree of infection and gastritis score; in contrast HPLOs and HFLOs infections are not very common.",

Neither for copper ( p &lt; 0.59) nor for zinc ( p &lt; 0.99) significant differences were demonstrated between cows in late pregnancy and heifers. Moreover, analysis of their feed revealed that the content of these minerals was half of the recommended levels.

Six non-pregnant Valachian sheep between two to four years of age, weighing 43 to 57 kg were treated with maggots of Lucilia sericata (Meigen) (Diptera: Calliphoridae). The larval population should be 8-12 per square centimetre of wound, but all affected tissues were trimmed away before their application. The effect of a single application for 3-6 days was evaluated. Debridement was rapid and selective. The treatment was well tolerated by animals. New layers of healthy tissue were formed over the wounds. It was observed that maggots of L. sericata are capable of cleaning the wounds after single application.",

Thus, the aim of this study was to assess whether the hormone exerts significant changes on phasic and tonic components of the duodenal motor activity and on phasic and tonic components of the duodenal MR. Mechanical and electrical activities of the duodenum were recorded in four sheep before and after slow intravenous cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-OP, doses 20, 200 and 2000 ng/kg b.w.) and cerulein (doses 1, 10 and 100 ng/kg b.w.) administration in the course of phase 2b of the migrating motor complex. During 5-20-minute periods the area under contraction curve for phasic, tonic and total motor activity was measured for the whole curve and separately for the MR- related activity. It was found that both CCK peptides stimulate phasic and tonic components of the duodenal motor activity as well as both these components of the duodenal MR. The effect of CCK peptides on the tonic component was stronger than on the phasic component. These effects were similar in non-fasted and fasted animals. CCK-OP evoked slightly greater effect than cerulein. The effects of these CCK peptides on phasic and tonic components of the MR were similar. It is concluded that CCK-OP and cerulein stimulate both phasic and tonic components of the duodenal motor activity and phasic and tonic components related to the MR in sheep.",

Three diets included control (0.2 ppm deoxynivalenol, 0.4 mg selenium/kg diet), deoxynivalenol-contaminated (3 ppm deoxynivalenol, 0.4 mg selenium/kg diet) and deoxynivalenol-contaminated (3 ppm deoxynivalenol) plus selenium-enriched yeast (1.4 mg selenium/kg diet). After 6 weeks of feeding all birds were sacrifi ced and blood samples for chemical analyses were collected. Plasma calcium, chloride and alanine aminotransferase activity were signifi cantly elevated and magnesium, total proteins, triglycerides and free glycerol were decreased in chicks fed deoxynivalenol-contaminated diet compared with those fed the control diet. Supplementation of selenium-enriched yeast to the diet reversed plasma levels of calcium, magnesium and alanine aminotransferase activity in chicks induced by dietary deoxynivalenol. Phosphorus, albumin and cholesterol levels and alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase activities were not affected by diets. The inclusion of selenium to DON-contaminated diet, however, did not completely alleviate toxic effect on protein and lipid metabolism by the liver. Supplementation of selenium-enriched yeast product counteracted most of the plasma indicator alterations caused by deoxynivalenol-contaminated diet in chicks.",

    "abstract": "Our aim was to examine the diagnostic potential of matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 for identifying osteoarthritis in the horse. Horses were divided into two groups - a positive group consisting of 28 horses with cartilage damage in the distal interphalangeal joint and a negative group of 17 control horses. Clinical examination of the horses included evaluation of lameness, flexion test, diagnostic nerve blocks, X-ray and arthroscopy. MMP-2 and MMP-9 were detected in synovial fluid using gelatin zymography. Monomers of MMP-2 and MMP-9 appeared not to be specific for osteoarthritis since they also occurred in control samples. In contrast, detection of active forms of MMPs was found to be more effective than radiological examination in identifying horses with osteoarthritis, on the grounds of higher sensitivity. Active forms of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were observed with 88.24% and 82.35% specificity respectively, indicating the high accuracy in correctly identifying horses without osteoarthritis. Thus, as an addition to clinical examination, detection of MMPs could improve the diagnosis of osteoarthritis. Detection of active forms of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was evaluated as an additional diagnostic tool in diagnosing osteoarthritis, especially in the case of a negative X-ray result. The proportions of animals with confirmed osteoarthritis, which tested positive, were found to be 81.82% and 76.92%, respectively. The results of this study confirm that active forms of MMP occur in synovial fluid of osteoarthritic joints more frequently than in synovial fluid from normal joints of the horse. Detection of active forms of MMP-2 and MMP-9 is shown to have an important diagnostic potential.",

A composicao microbiologica sofre as mesmas variacoes observadas nas outras especies animais, portanto torna-se importante a obtencao de leite de animais sadios e de forma higienica.\r\nPalavras-Chave: α-caseina, lactose, caprinocultura.",

They underwent four 8 week periods differing in type of food (dry, soft, dental diet) and preventive means of periodontitis (tooth-brushing and enzymatic chewing strips). The results showed nonsignificant influence of food consistency on dental plaque, calculus and gingivitis scores. Dental diet nonsignificantly decreased dental calculus deposition in comparison to common commercial food. The best results were achieved with toothbrushing. The enzymatic chewing strips significantly decreased dental plaque, calculus and gingivitis scores only on carnassial teeth. These results confirm that there are no absolute preventive measures of periodontitis.",

    "abstract": "The effects of sage extract on the activity of intestinal alkaline phosphatase (AP), proliferative ability of enterocytes, and growth performance in chickens were studied during 42 days of the experiment under commercial conditions. A significant increase of body weight gain was found in chickens fed with sage extract in the grower period (17-29 days of age) and in the finisher period (30-42 day of age). Total serum proteins were significantly ( p &lt; 0.05) increased at 29 days of age in animals treated with sage extract. A significant ( p &lt; 0.001) decrease in activity of intestinal AP was demonstrated on 29 and 42 days in animals fed with sage extract complemented diet. Proliferative activity of enterocytes was increased ( p &lt; 0.01) in the finisher period along the duodenal villi in animals treated with sage extract. We conclude that the higher growth performance was probably due to improved endogenous secretion of the liver as a consequence of increased total proteins mainly in the grower period. Decreased activity of intestinal alkaline phosphatase was not in correlation with proliferative ability of enterocytes and the lower activity of AP could be influenced by improved digestion of lipids.",

    "abstract": "In November 2001, October and November 2002, the concentrations of Hg, Cd, Pb, Cr, Cu, Zn and Ni were determined in four localities of the lower course of the Jihlava River (Czech Republic). The river water, sediments of the riverbed, zoobenthos and tissues of the fish (gill, gonad, skin, dorsal muscle) were analysed. The chub ( Leuciscus cephalus ) was used as the ichthyo-indicator. At the same time, the stability of the fish community was evaluated using electrofishing and applying basic ichthyological methods. The work links up with previous investigation of the upper course of the Jihlava River (three localities) carried out by the authors in the same way in 1999. The aim of present study was the completion of previous investigation in the whole longitudinal river profile by monitoring selected heavy metals. The highest Cr (14.290 – 77.070 mg/kg), Zn (13.600 – 92.930 mg/kg) and Ni concentrations (12.290 – 36.680 mg/kg) were found in sediments and their highest loading by all of the monitored metals (without Ni) was detected in the last downstream locality (Pohořelice). Zoobenthos was most contaminated by Zn and Cu (7.480 – 62.690 and 8.050 – 21.810 mg/kg). In the body tissues of the chubs, the highest concentrations of Cd, Hg, Cu, Zn and Ni were determined in the gills, while Pb was also high in gills but also in gonads, the skin and in the muscle tissue. Concentrations of the analysed metals in the chub muscle were (in mg/kg): Hg 0.040 ± 0.014 – 0.133 ± 0.063, Cd 0.003 ± 0.002 – 0.010 ± 0.004, Pb 0.045 ± 0.038 – 0.768 ± 0.038, Cr 0.046 ± 0.023 – 0.106 ± 0.092, Cu 0.203 ± 0.123 – 0.634 ± 0.194, Zn 4.25 ± 0.84 – 6.69 ± 2.95 and Ni 0.062 ± 0.018 – 0.103 ± 0.030. Significant differences in the chub muscle were found concerning Hg, Pb, Cu ( P &lt; 0.01) and Cd ( P &lt; 0.05). Taking into consideration the actually valid FAO/WHO limits for human consumption of chub muscle from the investigated river section, only Hg (PTWI 2.3 kg in locality 7) and Pb (PTWI 2.0 kg in locality 4) could constitute some risk for human health. The index of diversity of the fish community was 0.825 – 2.110, equitability index 0.380 – 0.793, abundance 312.6 – 2,106.5 fish/ha and biomass 46.7 – 451.5 kg/ha. The water quality was characterized as betamesosaprobic (saprobity index 1.77 – 2.18). The results of the study reveal detailed ecological data concerning heavy metals contamination of the whole Jihlava River ecosystem (water, sediment, zoobenthos, fish). The outcome of this study extends our knowledge about metals accumulation in different fish tissues (gill, gonad, skin and muscle).",

In four experiments, a total of 240 pieces of chicken leg were inoculated with a Salmonella Enteritidis, PT 8, wildtype strain resulting in initial concentrations of approximately 4 log, 2.5 log, 1.5 log and 0.5 log cells per piece and kept under selected modified atmospheres for 14 days. Counts of Salmonella were determined by the Most Probable Number method (MPN) at days 0, 3, 7, 10 and 14 of storage. No significant increase or decrease in Salmonella numbers was observed in the atmosphere of 20% CO 2 /80% O 2 . In the atmosphere of 30% CO 2 /70% N 2 there was a significant decrease in cell numbers at days 10 and 14; however, this decrease was proved only in experiments with an initial Salmonella concentration of 4 log and 1.5 log cells per piece. We proved that even low numbers of S. Enteritidis in the presence of natural microflora survive well on the surface of poultry stored at 3 °C in both modified atmospheres we tested. In the case of temperature abuse even products with low initial numbers of Salmonella may constitute a health risk for consumers.",

Naturally infected fish (1.5-year-old; K 1-2 ) were divided into 6 groups. Three trial groups were administered praziquantel mixed in heat-treated amyloid vehicle (at doses of 50 mg kg -1 body weight). In 3 groups of control, the fish were administered amyloid vehicle only. Fish were examined using gut dissection 2, 4 and 6 days after the administration. The location, intensity and prevalence of individual species of tapeworms were recorded. A. huronensis and K. sinensis were found in the gut of carp together. A. huronensis was situated in the oesophageal part of foregut, and K. sinensis came after – immediately before the first intestine loop, of the intestines of carp. The invasion of A. huronensis was fully eliminated in all trial groups after 4 days whereas some specimens of K. sinensis still persisted in the gut of few fish. The full elimination of both parasites was observed 6 days after administration. Our results showed that elimination of K. sinensis takes longer than elimination of A. huronensis . The dose of 50 mg kg -1 of orally administered praziquantel is effectual to control A. huronensis and K. sinensis infections in common carp successfully, however, a significant decrease of the number of parasites was also caused by a single oral administration of big bolus vehicle and leaving unfed fish in the clean water.",

Significant traces are documented in the environment, mainly waters, soil and plants used for human and domestic animal nutrition. The aim of this study was to investigate whether prometryne, administered orally, could induce changes in metabolic patterns and cause cell damage in specific organs of exposed mice. Three different doses of prometryne (185, 375, 555 mg kg -1 ) were given per os repeatedly every 48 h, in a subchronic in vivo experimental design. After 28 days (14 doses), the correlations between the basic blood biochemistry indicators were analyzed (LDH, GGT, AlP, creatinine, ALT, AST). The increase in GGT and decrease in creatinine were the most distinct effects. LDH and AlP were increased, but rather explicitly in different dosage groups. ALT and AST did not change significantly, indicating that liver damage was milder than expected. Significant correlations between specific enzymes in renal tissue were lost in exposed groups. The correlations between muscle tissue specific enzymes were significant as a result of prometryne toxicity. Disbalance in relations between the serum indicators under study indicates that prometryne might have a myotoxic and nephrotoxic potential and the potential to affect enzymes and molecules important in normal metabolic pathways of bioenergetic physiology.",

Group 1 (control) was given only pure olive oil, Groups 2, 3 and 4 were administered lindane at 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg/bw, respectively, by gastric gavage for 30 days. Microscopically, degenerative changes were observed in the lindane-treated groups. For proliferative activity PCNA immunolabelling and for germ cells apoptosis TUNEL methods were performed. Although a strong PCNA positivity in the control group was observed, a gradual decrease was noted in the lindane-treated groups especially at higher doses. Significant increases of apoptosis were seen in the lindane-treated groups compared to the control group. A decrease in testosterone concentrations was observed in lindane-treated groups compared to the control group. The study indicates that high-dose lindane intoxication contributes to the suppression of spermatogenesis through a reduction of germ cell proliferation and an increase of germ cell death in rat testes.",

The drug was given as a single intramuscular dose of 5 mg/kg. The plasma concentrations of the drug were determined with HPLC and pharmacokinetic variables were determined. The biological half-life (t 1/2 β was longer in cows (3.25 ± 0.46 h) followed by intermediate values in buffaloes (3.05 ± 0.20 h) and sheep (2.93 ± 0.45 h) and shorter in goats (2.62 ± 0.39 h). The volume of distribution (V d ) in buffaloes was 1.09 ± 0.06 l/kg, cows 1.24 ± 0.16 l/kg, sheep 2.89 ± 0.30 l/kg and goats 3.76 ± 0.92 l/kg. Total body clearance (Cl B ) expressed in l/h/kg was minimum in buffaloes 0.25 ± 0.02 followed by values in cows 0.31 ± 0.02 and sheep 0.75 ± 0.04 and maximum in goats 1.09 ± 0.11. An optimal dosage regimen for 12-h interval consisted of 5.17, 5.62, 6.54 and 6.10 mg/kg body weight as priming and 4.84, 5.37, 6.26 and 5.91 mg/kg body weight as maintenance intramuscular dose in buffalo, cow, sheep and goat, respectively. The manufacturers of ciprofloxacin have claimed 5 mg/kg dose to be repeated after 24 h. However, the investigated dosage regimen may be repeated after 12 h to maintain MIC at the end of the dosage interval. Therefore, it is imperative that an optimal dosage regimen be based on the disposition kinetics data determined in the species and environment in which a drug is to be employed clinically.",

A total of 87 farmers from 14 counties of northern Tocantins were interviewed and the properties were visited. According to reports, Palicourea marcgravii and Brachiaria decumbens were the main plants responsible for poisoning, in addition to outbreaks reports caused by Manihot esculenta, Ipomoea asarifolia, Enterolobium contortisiliquum, Pteridium aquilinum, Dimorphandra mollis, Stryphnodendron obovatum, Ricinus communis, and Palicourea juruana were also relevant. The apparently less important plants were Ipomoea setifera, Manihot glaziovii, Senna occidentallis, Enterolobium gumiferum, Crotalaria sp. e Asclepias sp. Among the plants reported as poisonous to cattle, but without toxicity yet established were mentioned Buchenavia tomentosa as a cause of abortion and death, Parkia pendula as a cause of incoordination, Psychotria colorata and Samanea tubulosa as abortive and Mucuna pruriens as responsible for mucosa irritation. It is concluded that the outbreaks by poisonous plants at the ecotone region of Amazonia and Savanna show particular characteristics although presents certain similarity to other regions of Brazil. This study revealed the presence of plants with the toxicity not established yet and the outbreaks occurrence related to them shows the importance to livestock and deserve to be investigated. Although the farmers have some knowledge of main poisonous plants, the high incidence of outbreaks in the region shows that there is a lack of studies aimed at prevention and control of poisoning to avoid economic losses.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Cattle, poisoning, ruminant, toxicology.",

The mobile phase consisted of water and methanol used in a gradient programme. Fluorescence detection was performed on the supernatant obtained from plasma after protein precipitation with 100% acetone. Limits of quantification were 0.5 ng∙ml -1 for skatole and 1.0 ng∙ml -1 for indole. Accuracy and precision had less than 12% deviation in the linear ranges (0.5–256 ng∙ml -1 and R 2 = 0.9999 for skatole, 1.0–256 ng∙ml -1 and R 2 = 0.9999 for indole). The correlation between plasma and serum concentrations was strong for skatole (slope = 1.01, R 2 = 0.999) and moderate for indole (slope = 0.65, R 2 = 0.95). Analysis of skatole in plasma was in good accordance with our previous acetonitrile-based method (slope = 0.91, R 2 = 0.988). The proposed method is suited for rapid routine analysis because of its high selectivity, accuracy and precision. Furthermore, it needs only simple sample preparation and the use of methanol instead of acetonitrile in the mobile phase. This method is of practical use to researchers in the field of boar taint.",

The highest contamination with risk metals was found in chub from the Svratka. The assessed concentrations have shown minimum participation of the Brno agglomeration in the accumulation of metals. The concentrations of all risk elements in chub from all of the monitored localities do not pose any environmental or health threat.

Correlation coefficients: R = 0.911, R = 0.929 and R = 0.959 for soluble nitrogen, tryptophan and tyrosine, respectively, were achieved during measuring in the integrating sphere; R = 0.807, R = 0.945, R = 0.928 were achieved for soluble nitrogen, tryptophan and tyrosine, respectively, during measuring by probe. The results of the study show that NIR technology is suitable for fast and approximate determination of the level of cheese ripening. This can be used for the evaluation of the material for the processed cheese production, or cheese sale in optimal level of ripening.",

The epidemiology, clinical signs, histological findings and the results of the lectin histochemistry analysis of a nervous cells and epithelial cells are also reported. Five goats that remained with neurological signs were examined in more detail. Two goats were necropsied. Histological lesions consisted of neurons with thin cytoplasm vacuolation, presence of axonal spheroids and vacuolation in pancreatic acinar cells, thyroid folliculars cells, hepatocytes and renal tubular cells. On lectin-histochemical analysis, cerebellar cells, pancreatic acinar cells and follicular thyroid cells showed positive staining for Concanavalia ensiformis , Triticum vulgaris , succinylated Triticum vulgaris and Lens culinare s, which indicate the storage of α-D-mannose, α-D-glucose, β-D-N-acetyl-glucosamine, and acetyl-neuraminic acid. It is concluded that I . sericophylla is an important toxic plant that causes lysosomal storage disease in goats at semi-arid region of Pernambuco, Brazil.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a one-week feed restriction of different intensities on haematological and biochemical blood indices at the end of the feed restriction and during the realimentation period in growing rabbits. Hyplus rabbits weaned at 35 days of age (n = 195) were divided into three groups: rabbits fed ad libitum (AL) and groups with reduced feed of 50 g (R50) or 65 g (R65) per rabbit per day from 42 to 49 days of age. At the end of the feed restriction and in the following period, haematological and biochemical blood indices were measured at weekly intervals. The live weight at 70 days of age was lower ( P ≤ 0.001) in restricted rabbits (–14.5% and –15.5% for group R50 and R65, respectively, compared to AL). Feed restriction significantly ( P ≤ 0.011) decreased the number of erythrocytes (–6.2% and –7.4% for group R50 and R65, respectively, compared to AL) and haemoglobin content ( P ≤ 0.008). The mean corpuscular volume increased ( P ≤ 0.033) in restricted rabbits. Interaction of the feeding regime and age ( P ≤ 0.007) was observed in cholesterol with the highest concentration in R50 at 56 days (4.41 mmol/l) and the lowest in R65 at 70 days and in AL at 63 days of age (1.30 mmol/l). The concentration of non-esterified fatty acids ( P ≤ 0.003) and triacylglycerides ( P ≤ 0.048) were significantly lower in restricted rabbits. It could be concluded that feed restriction influenced mainly erythrocytes and haemoglobin. The changes in biochemical blood characteristics suggest the restriction did not affect protein metabolism, however, results indicate lipid depletion in restricted rabbits.",

The question addressed in the present study was to what extent the diet containing the sea-buckthorn pomace would affect the viscosity and colour of egg yolk measured in the CIELAB system. The feeding mixture for laying hens was supplemented with 20; 50 and 100 g∙kg -1 of sea-buckthorn pomace. As a result, colour indices of the egg yolk such as L*, a* and b* changed significantly (α = 0.01). The greatest relative enhancement was observed for indicator a* for the red colour. Visually, this corresponds to the more intense orange colour of the egg yolk. The addition of sea-buckthorn pomace to the diet for laying hens resulted in a larger increase in indicator ∆ E * (CIE total colour difference) compared to the control group. Colour indicator h ab is the only indicator whose value oscillated around that determined for the control group. The addition of sea-buckthorn pomace to the diet resulted in an increase in colour indices a*, b* and C * ab . Indicator ∆ E * also increased significantly with an increasing amount of sea-buckthorn pomace in a diet. Egg yolks were darker, had more intense red and yellow colours, and showed lower viscosity which are all features preferred by the consumer.",

    "abstract": "Fish can be exposed to multiple stressors at the same time, including natural toxins, environmental pollutants or feed contamination. In this study, we report on the effects of controlled exposure of rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) to multiple stressors. In doing so, we test the hypothesis that cyanobacterial biomass and arsenic in feed combine to enhance negative effects on fish, including modulation of antioxidant response. The trout (mean weight 288 ± 59 g) were divided into six experimental groups of 25 fish each (C - control group; B - 3% lyophilised toxic cyanobacterial biomass; As5 - arsenic at 5 mg·kg –1 ; As50 - arsenic at 50 mg·kg –1 ; and two combinations of cyanobacterial biomass and arsenic (B+As5 and B+As50). All indicators of oxidative stress were determined using standard methods, showing significant changes. Overall antioxidant capacity (ferric reducing antioxidant power) decreased significantly in the liver, gills and heart after 10-days, while lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) increased in the liver of groups exposed to cyanobacterial biomass, and in the heart of groups exposed to increased concentrations of arsenic and those under combined exposure. Levels of glutathione reductase showed a significant reduction following exposure, especially in the gills and liver. Our results indicate that the antioxidant system plays an important role in the protective response of tissues to stressors, and especially arsenic.",

During the experiment, chick embryos were exposed to artificial electromagnetic fields throughout incubation for 13 ´ 2 min/day, 4 ´ 10 min/day and 1 ´ 40 min/day. After hatching, blood was collected from 10 one-day-old chicks from each group to determine: red blood cell count, haemoglobin concentration, haematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin, mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration, white blood cell count, and leukocyte differential count. In addition, the heterophil/lymphocyte ratio was calculated. The present study is probably the first to show an increase in the red blood cell count, haemoglobin concentration, haematocrit, white blood cell count, segmented heterophils and the heterophil/lymphocyte ratio, and a decrease in lymphocyte percentage of embryos exposed to an 1800 MHz electromagnetic field. The observed changes may be indicative of the stress-inducing effect of EMF on living organisms.",

    "abstract": "A lesion of sacrococcygeal spinal nerve roots forming a structure that resembles a horse's tail results in the development of clinical entity identified as the cauda equina syndrome (CES). The disease can evolve slowly and symptomatology can be incomplete, but the fully developed CES is characterized by pain and altered sensation in the pelvic extremities, tail, perianogenital region, paresis or plegia of hind limbs, incontinence and impotence. Major causes of CES in dogs are degenerative changes of the lumbosacral vertebral column, haematoma, inflammation, neoplasm or trauma. The diagnosis is based on history, clinical presentation, neurological symptomatology, spinal röntgenography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. In animals experiencing initial episodes of CES, conservative therapy can be attempted. But the only rational treatment of patients with severe neurological deficit is surgical decompression of the neural structures. The outcome depends on the underlying aetiology and the degree of sensory, motor and autonomic dysfunction. Canine and porcine experimental models mimicking the CES showed the involvement of intrinsic spinal cord structures. This points out the need for an early diagnosis followed by aggressive management before irreversible neuronal lesions develop. The search strategy involved the PubMed, Medline, Embase and ISI Web of Science from January 2000 to August 2017 using the terms 'cauda equina syndrome' and 'lumbosacral stenosis' in the English language literature; also references from selected papers were scanned and relevant articles included.",

    "abstract": "The most commonly used probiotic bacteria belong to the genus Lactobacillus , being regarded as beneficial for poultry health and production. However, commercial probiotics do not always ensure both expected effects. In order to improve the utility properties of new preparations, the selection of new probiotic candidates should be made on the basis of the performance of the species within the poultry digestive tract. The aim of this study was to isolate and identify lactobacilli from poultry intestines, and to select probiotic candidates for subsequent in vivo trials. Digesta from 18 poultry specimens were collected, serially diluted, plated onto Wilkins-Chalgren anaerobe agar supplemented with 30% of rumen fluid and onto De Man, Rogosa and Sharpe agar plates, and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h under anaerobic conditions. Isolated colonies were subjected to Gram staining and catalase reaction. They were then pre-identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time of flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS). Forty-four Lactobacillus strains belonging to 16 species were identified and subjected to evaluations of survival under simulated gastrointestinal conditions, autoaggregation and hydrophobicity. Most of the screened Lactobacillus reuteri strains as well as individual strains of L. acidophilus , L. salivarius , L. saerimneri , and L. vaginalis showed high survival rates under gastrointestinal tract conditions and good surface properties. The results suggest their potential for further testing as probiotic candidates in in vivo trials.",

    "abstract": "The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae from koumiss has been shown to have antibacterial effects on Escherichia coli , possibly by producing antibacterial compound in metabolism; however, there is limited knowledge about its application in animal production. We therefore investigated the effects of an antibacterial compound of S. cerevisiae from koumiss on the immune function and caecal microflora of mice challenged with pathogenic Escherichia coli O8. Three groups were formed: negative control (NC), positive control (PC), and the antibacterial compound of S. cerevisiae at pH 2.0 (S2). Mice in the NC and PC groups were orally administered phosphate buffer solution (PBS) for 7 d. At 4 d, E. coli O8 was administered intraperitoneally in group PC. Mice in group S2 were first administered orally as mice in group NC, and subsequently intraperitoneally administered E. coli O8 as mice in group PC. Compared with the NC group, mice in the PC group displayed clinical symptoms and pathological changes in the small intestine. Small intestine villi in the S2 group also developed some histologically pathological changes but not as severe as in the PC group. Moreover, there was less mortality in the S2 group than in the PC group. In PC group, thymus indexes, immunoglobulin A (IgA) in serum and Bifidobacterium in caecum were decreased and E. coli in the caecum was increased. In the S2 group, CD8+ of T lymphocyte subsets in blood and Bifidobacterium in caecum were decreased, while spleen indexes, IgG, IgM in serum, and CD3+ of T lymphocyte subsets in blood were increased. This suggests that S2 can relieve clinical symptoms of mice challenged with pathogenic E. coli O8, enhance their immune function, and influence their caecal microflora. The study will provide a theoretical foundation for utilizing antibacterial compound of S. cerevisiae from koumiss for curative purposes.",

In the present study, osajin was experimentally used on indomethacin-induced gastric ulcer in rats. Osajin was purified from Maclura pomifera (Raf.) C. K. Schneid fruits by using the chromatographic methods. Thirty six rats were divided into six groups as follows: healthy (control), IND (indomethacin), RAN (ranitidine, 25 mg/kg), OSJ 100 (osajin, 100 mg/kg), OSJ 200 (200 mg/kg) and OSJ 400 (osajin, 400 mg/kg). Following a 24-h fasting, IND was administered to the treatment groups at a dose of 25 mg/kg. RAN and OSJ were given orally to rats following 5 min of IND administration. Then, gastric tissues were taken 6 h after the IND administration. Determination of the ulcer area, pathological evidence, and biochemical indices such as lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and catalase were performed. IND generated diffuse ulcer areas, severe hyperaemia, oedema, necrotic epithelium, and mononuclear cell infiltration in the mucosa, and significantly increased lipid peroxidation while also decreasing the glutathione concentration, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities of the tissue. OSJ and RAN showed significant amelioration on ulcer area and biochemical indices. Therefore, OSJ may be potentially therapeutic for gastric ulcers.",

The nucleotide sequences of PCR products were 100% homologous to the Western roe deer papillomavirus 1 isolate CcPV-1. Ticks and deer keds from positive roe deer and ticks from dogs were PCR and DNA sequence positive for the roe deer papillomavirus. Viral DNA was also demonstrated in one blood sample from a roe deer female. Differences in metallothionein, zinc, taurine and electrochemical index among samples from lesions and normal skin of affected roe deer and negative controls from papillomavirus-non-infected animals were non-significant. While we have demonstrated circulation of specific roe deer papillomavirus in the Czech Republic that results in multiple fibropapillomatous skin tumours, many ecological and epidemiological issues of this wildlife disease still remain unanswered.",

The next day the minipigs were paraplegic but improved rapidly to paraparesis. On the 12 th postoperative day they were euthanasied. Neural tissue changes were evaluated by post mortem MRI, which showed damage to the spinal cord white and/or gray matter in the epicentre of compression with longitudinal spreading over one segment cranially and caudally. Statistical analyses performed by Spearman’s rho test revealed positive correlations between damaged areas and the whole area of the spinal cord white/gray matter ( P = 0.047; r s = 0.742) and ( P = 0.002; r s = 0.943), respectively.

Also, liver tissue sections were examined to follow histological changes. Chlorpromazine was applied intraperitoneally at a single dose of 38.7 mg/kg b.w. The second group was treated with both chlorpromazine (at a single dose of 38.7 mg/kg b.w.) and agmatine (at a single dose of 75 mg/kg b.w.). Agmatine was applied immediately after the chlorpromazine. The control group was treated with 0.9% saline solution in the same manner. Rats were sacrificed by decapitation 24 h after the treatment and biochemical and immunohistochemical examinations were performed. Analysis of data showed that treatment with agmatine significantly attenuated the oxidative stress indicators as evidenced by lowering malonylaldehyde concentrations in the liver and in plasma while not affecting liver concentrations of total glutathione and plasma concentration of sulfhydryl groups. Additionally, histological evaluation revealed the improvement of liver damage in this respect.

    "abstract": "Staphylococci form part of the normal flora of humans and a wide variety of animals. Some staphylococcal species also cause infections for human and household pets. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of coagulase-positive staphylococci in humans and dogs within a common household. Coagulase-positive staphylococci could not be identified phenotypically in all cases. Molecular methods were used for the correct identification of pathogenic staphylococci. The prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus was identified in 26/72 (36.1%) dog owners and in 4/61 (6.6%) dogs. Staphylococcus pseudintermedius was isolated from three (4.2%) humans, and from 28 dogs (45.9%). Other coagulase-positive staphylococci species were not isolated in this study. Colonization of S. aureus in humans was significantly higher than in dogs ( P &lt; 0.001). Staphylococcus pseudintermedius was more common in dogs compared to humans ( P &lt; 0.001). Staphylococcus pseudintermedius strains were isolated from dogs with clinical symptoms more frequently compared to healthy dogs ( P = 0.02). Colonization of S. aureus in female dogs was significantly higher compared to male dogs ( P = 0.045). The same staphylococci species were isolated from the dog and its owner in six households (12%, 6/50).",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to test the reactions of domestic guinea pigs to the presence of aerial and terrestrial predators in a laboratory setting. We measured the behavioural reactions of 27 adolescent guinea pigs to the presence of a dog, imitation of a bird of prey and an unknown human as control. Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA and Mann-Whitney U Test were used to analyse the differences in duration and frequency of responses (freezing, fleeing, and vigilance) to predators. When confronted with the dog, guinea pigs reacted for the longest time and most frequently by freezing. In presence of the bird of prey, they responded for the longest time and most often by freezing and fleeing. In presence of a human, they showed mostly vigilance. When comparing reactions to the dog and human, there were differences in duration and frequency of freezing and fleeing. When comparing reactions to the bird of prey and control test, we observed differences between fleeing and vigilance. The durations and frequencies of freezing, fleeing and vigilance to the dog and bird of prey were different. The only differences in reactions of males and females occurred in duration and frequency of fleeing in presence of the bird of prey. No vocalization was observed except for two occurrences, of a “drrr” and a “chirrup”. Our results indicate that domestic guinea pigs tested under laboratory conditions can discriminate between a terrestrial and an aerial predator, when exposed to them individually. Their antipredator behaviours remained functional, although their vocalizations may have been affected by the absence of signal receivers.",

    "abstract": "This study illustrates the main morphological structures of the cloaca of six adult horned vipers Vipera ammodytes (3.3). The coprodeum is characterized by smooth and thin mucosa, with moderate vasculature. In the centre of the coprodeum the anal sphincter is located, which separates the coprodeum from the colon. Structures of the urodeum are divided by two highly developed septa in female vipers. The urodeum in female vipers is characterized by distinct chambers, which become visible immediately behind the exit of the sphincter of the coprodeum. Vaginal pouches leading to the entrance of the oviduct are visible. The male urodeum is characterized by two distinct structures. In the upper part of the urodeum, the coprodeum sphincter surrounded by a gently folded mucosa, and the urethral papillae surface on a large mucosal protrusion emerging from the dorsal urodeum are visible in male horned vipers. The mucosal protrusion that hosts the urethral papillae can be found in two different appearances, closed or open. The proctodeum is a tubular and muscular structure that leads to the vent. Cloacoscopy is as a safe and effective method for cloaca exploration in both sexes of the horned viper. This technique may be used to assist artificial insemination in the horned viper in the future.",

    "abstract": "Translocation (including transportation and experiencing a new environment) represents a significant stressor for animals. The aim of this study was to assess changes in corticosterone metabolite (CM) levels related to translocation in common pheasants ( Phasianus colchicus ). Sixteen birds (8 males and 8 females) aged 17 weeks were crated and transported for 3.5 h (distance travelled 140 km) to the target customer. Serial individual droppings were collected from 2 days prior until 3 days after transport. Concentrations of CMs in droppings were determined with a non-commercial cortisone enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Transport stress resulted in increased CM concentrations in the droppings in our study. The CM concentrations significantly increased within 2.5 h of transport ( P &lt; 0.01) compared to pre-transport levels (747 ng/g vs. 187 ng/g). After additional 3 h, the CM concentrations fell back to the baseline levels (207.7 ng/g). In the new environment, the second peak (median: 1383 ng/g) was determined with CM concentrations increasing ( P &lt; 0.01) compared to baseline levels. This increase was likely connected to the stress resulting from the new environment. The CM levels returned back to the baseline level 26 h after the start of transportation. No differences in concentrations of CM between sexes were found in our study. The utilized cortisone EIA proved suited to detect biologically meaningful alterations in adrenocortical activity of pheasants exposed to procedures related to their transport.",

In this study a methanolic extract from roots was used to examine its anti-tumour effect by using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) viability assay on two mouse tumour cell lines, fibrosarcoma and hepatoma cell lines. Normal hepatocyte and fibroblast cell lines were used as a control. Furthermore, three active compounds were isolated from the extract, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and ursolic acid, in order to investigate their cytotoxicity and possible interactions between them in their combinations on the same tumour and non-tumour cell lines. The anti-tumour effect of the TO extract was confirmed on the fibrosarcoma cell line in a dose dependent manner. The anti-proliferative acting of each acid was described on both cancer cell lines and for the first time the combinations of these acids were investigated and their common effect in the mixtures reported. Further experiments to determine the mechanism of action and examine their action with conventional chemotherapeutics as a potential adjuvant therapy to enhance the chemotherapeutic effect and improve patient health with its hepatoprotective activity could be encouraged.",

Foods were inoculated with different S. aureus strains capable of producing type A, B, and C staphylococcal enterotoxins and incubated at 15, 25, and 30 °C. During the storage, samples were analysed for S. aureus counts and for staphylococcal enterotoxins. An enzyme-linked fluorescence assay was used to detect staphylococcal enterotoxins. The influence of inappropriate storage on S. aureus growth and staphylococcal enterotoxin production was evaluated. No staphylococcal enterotoxins were detected in sandwiches stored for 72 h at any of the tested temperatures. In buttercream puffs, enterotoxins type A, B, and C were detected within 24 h of storage at 25 °C.",

    "abstract": "The main aim of this experiment was to verify the suitability of two Polish varieties of dehulled lupin seed (the low-protein SONET variety and the high-protein JUNO variety) as protein components to replace 50% of soya extract meal in feeding mixtures designed for the feeding of young broilers. The results of this experiment demonstrate that suitable treatment of lupin seed (dehulling) may significantly increase its nutritional value. Dehulling provides a product (core) in which the level of nitrogen-containing substances is by 27% higher than that in the original seed, providing an important protein component to be added in feeding mixtures for chickens. The experiment has also shown that production performance depends on the particular Lupinus variety used. Chickens fed on the JUNO variety seed (Group E1) reached a live weight of 2.332 kg on Day 40, which is comparable with the control group of chickens (2.337 kg; Group C). However, chickens in Group E2 fed on the SONET variety seed had a conclusively lower average weight (2.280 kg) ( P &lt; 0.05). Feed consumption per kg of weight gain at this level of average live weight was as follows: 1.89 kg (Group C), 1.85 kg (Group E1), and 1.93 kg (Group E2). The results confirm the suitability of dehulled lupin seed as a substitute for soya extract meal. When designing the composition of feeding mixtures one has to know the exact nutritional composition of the particular lupin variety. One important finding from a nutritional point of view is that the seed of the Lupinus genus is a major source of the amino acid arginine, which is often deficient in the feeding mixtures.",

    "abstract": "Common carp ( Cyprinus carpio L. ) were exposed to nitrite (1.45 mmol l -1 NO 2 - ) for 48 hours at 14 °C and 20 °C, in order to investigate the mechanism of nitrite poisoning at these water temperatures. The effect of nitrite exposure on fish was assessed on selected haematological and biochemical indicators of the blood. Moreover, nitrite accumulation in the blood, liver and muscle was measured. Nitrite exposure produced high levels of methaemoglobin (88.2 ± 3.3% and 92.9 ± 6.1%) at both water temperatures compared with controls (0.3 ± 0.6% and 2.6 ± 3.0%). High fish mortality occurred in experimental groups (30% and 51%) compared with controls (0%). Nitrite exposure also resulted in an accumulation of nitrite in the fish body. The highest nitrite levels developed in the blood plasma, followed by the liver and muscle, respectively. Carp concentrated nitrite in the blood plasma and tissues to markedly higher levels at higher temperature (20 °C). The plasma nitrite concentrations (10.5 ± 1.9 mmol l -1 ) were in this case more than 7 times higher than the environmental one. At lower temperature (14 °C), plasma nitrite concentration reached 5.0 ± 1.5 mmol l -1 . In either event, plasma K + levels increased and Cl - levels and osmolality remained unchanged. Plasma Na + levels slightly decreased at the higher temperature. Nitriteexposed fish showed lower haematocrit values (PCV) at both experimental temperatures compared with controls. At 20 °C, the blood haematocrit decrease (0.20 ± 0.02 l l -1 ) was accompanied by a low erythrocyte count (1.05 ± 0.12 1012 l -1 ) and by a low haemoglobin level (51 ± 11 g l -1 ). At the lower temperature (14 °C), the haematocrit decrease (0.25 ± 0.02 l l -1 ) was caused by a low mean corpuscular volume (167 ± 27 fl). No significant changes were observed in the mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), or selected erythrocyte dimensions (major axis, minor axis and aspect ratio).",

During the period of 1997 - 2004 inspectors of the State Veterinary Administration in the Czech Republic recorded the number of healthy calves transported for standard slaughter and numbers of calves that died in connection with this transport; furthermore, they recorded numbers of diseased calves transported for emergency slaughter and numbers of calves that died in connection with this transport. The calf mortality rate in connection with transport for standard slaughter and in connection with transport for emergency slaughter was 0.026% (29/113144) and 3.266% (2260/69207), respectively. The mortality rate during transport for emergency slaughter is considerably higher, an expression in the form of a ratio index is 127.4. The total number of calf deaths during transport for slaughter significantly increased ( p &lt; 0.01) due to calf diseases. The effect of the journey distance on calf mortality in connection with transport was manifested as follows: during transport up to 50 km the recorded mortality rate was 0.019% for standard slaughter and 3.029% for an emergency one. In case of a longer journey distance, up to 200 km, a higher mortality rate was detected, namely 0.110% for standard slaughter and 5.177% for an emergency one. Due to diseases the number of calf deaths during transport up to 50, 100 and 200 km significantly increased ( p &lt; 0.01). A long-term tendency concerning increase or decrease of calf disease effect on the mortality rate in calves during transport for slaughter depending on individual years of the period monitored was not proved. Calf disease significantly decreases calf welfare during their transport for slaughter and considerably increases number of calves that died in connection with transport for slaughter.",

The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse, by means of the completely randomized design in factorial scheme 2 x 4 with four replications, from which two water volumes (V1 = 80% of the estimated field capacity, and V2 40% of the estimated field capacity, at about every 3 days) and 4 nitrogen doses (0, 100, 200 and 300 kg.ha-1) in the form of urea, which corresponded to 0, 0.9, 1.8 and 2.7 g/pot, parceled in three times.

While the toxicity of individual substances is usually well known, information about their mutual interactions is relatively scarce. In animal experiments the prevailing trend is to substitute higher vertebrates with biotests of the 2nd generation. Our experiment focused on observation of the effect of combinations of ZnSO 4 .7H 2 O and CdCl 2 .2H 2 O on lethality to Artemia franciscana . The aim of the study was to observe the synergistic or antagonistic effects of these two metals. Depending on concentration, cadmium may increase or decrease the toxicity of zinc. at higher concentrations of CdCl 2 .2H 2 O exceeding 100 mg l -1 one can observe obvious synergistic toxic effects of both the substances. Our observations allowed us to conclude that the use of optimum, relatively low concentrations of cadmium (up to 50 mg l -1 CdCl 2 .2H 2 O) results in a significant decrease in lethality to Artemia franciscana caused by ZnSO 4 .7H 2 O at concentrations of 50, 100 a 250 mg l -1 .",

Phylogenetic comparison to North American and European IHNV isolates revealed that this Croatian isolate belongs to the M genogroup, confirming the prediction of the M genogroup origin of European IHNV isolates.

    "abstract": "Clostridium perfringens is a causative agent of human and animal foodborne diseases. It is known as a normal inhabitant of the intestinal tract of chickens as well as a potential pathogen causing necrotic enteritis. The aim of the present study was to detect the incidence of C. perfringens in healthy broiler chickens. From May 2005 to September 2006, 609 samples of caecal content from broilers from 23 intensive poultry farms were analyzed. The samples were cultivated on TSC and blood agar, typical colonies were identified and biochemically confirmed. the total number of positive samples was 112 (18.39%). the samples were processed by the multiplex polymerase chain reaction method (PCR) for toxin genotyping. The presence of alpha, beta, beta2 and enterotoxin gene was detected. All C. perfringens isolates were classified as type A, four isolates had the cpb2 gene. In conclusion the prevalence of C. perfringens -positive farms is approximately 74% and the amount ranges about 10 4 cfu/g of caecal content.",

    "abstract": "The study was undertaken to examine the effect of oral administration of dimethoate (Bi 58 Nowy) and/or pyrantel tartrate on the concentration of glutathione (GSH) and vitamin C in rat liver. Rats of Group I were administered pyrantel tartrate at a dose of 85 mg/kg b.w. at a twoweek interval, while the animals of Group II received Bi 58 Nowy (38% dimethoate) at a dose of 25 mg/kg b.w. for 28 days, and animals of Group III received both compounds together as described above. Pyrantel tartrate was found to increase the concentration of glutathione in the liver, whereas the content of vitamin C oscillated around values reported for the control. After a 28-day exposure to dimethoate (Bi 58 Nowy), except for the 6th hour after intoxication, the content of GSH was observed to increase and significant differences ( p ≤ 0.05) occurred after days 3 and 14 ( p ≤ 0.01). The concentration of vitamin C in liver homogenates after dimethoate administration was decreased compared to the control until day 3. An increase was then observed continuing until the end of the experiment. In animals receiving both compounds, except for day 7, the concentration of vitamin C was slightly decreased. The administration of pyrantel tartrate before dimethoate (Bi 58 Nowy) only in some time intervals was found to reduce the intensity of changes evoked by the exclusive administration of insecticide. It may suggest that not in all cases of mixed intoxications, intensification should be expected in changes of the variables analyzed.",

    "abstract": "This study used biochemical markers to assess contamination at two contaminated sites (Králíky and Lichkov) and one control site (Červená Voda) on the River Tichá Orlice, a left-side tributary of the River Elbe. The brown trout ( Salmo trutta fario ) was selected as an indicator species. Enzymes of the first stage of xenobiotic conversion, namely cytochrome P450 (CYP 450) and ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) in the liver were selected as biochemical markers. Blood plasma vitellogenin concentrations were used to evaluate xenoestrogenic effects of contamination. Results were compared with the most important inductors of these markers, i.e. with organic pollutants (PCB, HCH, HCB, OCS and DDT and their metabolites in fish muscle and with PAH concentrations in bottom sediments). The highest contamination with organic pollutants was at Králíky, and this was reflected in increased cytochrome P450, EROD activity and vitellogenin concentrations. Significant differences were demonstrated in EROD activity and vitellogenin concentrations between Králíky and Červená Voda ( P &lt; 0.001). At the most contaminated site (Králíky), a significant negative correlation (r s = -0.964) between EROD activity and vitellogenin concentrations was demonstrated. This relationship was discussed from the point of view of a possible induction or inhibition of the assessed biomarkers at persistently highly contaminated sites.",

In dogs this percentage increases up for 18%. The formation of crystals and calculus is caused by reduction on the urinary frequency associated to the supersaturation of the urine, and it could be related to dietary factors. Among the substantial existing uroliths, the most founded are struvite and calcium oxalate. The nutrition could be related to the formation, prevention and treatment of urolithiasis.

The objective of the present study was to analyse the follicle status after parturition in non-lactating Improved Valachian ewes. Laparotomy with following ovariectomy was performed after lamb weaning (spring) on days 17, 24 and 32 after parturition. The ovaries were USG analysed with 5.0 MHz linear and 7.5 MHz convex transducer. Follicular data were analysed quantitatively and qualitatively. The ovaries were collected at the end of laparotomy and fixed in 10% formalin. The sections of the ovarian tissue were stained with haematoxylin and eosin and Azan staining. Ovarian slides were microscopically studied and analysed by LUCIA-G ver. 4.71. The differences in the ovary size were not significant. The number of follicles &lt; 3 mm monitored by USG on day 32 was higher than that on day 17 after parturition. The image analysis of the ovary sections showed significantly higher numbers in the total follicles ( P &lt; 0.05) and the follicles &gt; 3 mm ( P &lt; 0.001). The rate of atresia was 82% and 89% on day 17 and on day 32 post partum, respectively. We observed single ovulation on day 17 and double ovulations on days 24 and 32 post partum. More than half of the total number of antral follicles visible on the ovary surface was prepared for recruitment and this number was higher on day 32 post partum. Follicle selection connected with a relatively low rate of atresia and responsible preovulatory follicle sizes opened the way for selecting more follicles for the dominance process and thus also for the occurrence of double ovulations.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to analyse the effect of body size of dogs on their coexistence with humans in Czech households. For this purpose we used questionnaire data on 246 dogs indicating the breed. The dogs were divided into five body size groups, i.e. toy (T, up to 5 kg body mass, n = 32), small (S, 5 - 10 kg body mass, n = 52), medium size (M, 10 - 17 kg body mass, n = 39), large (L, 17 - 33 kg body mass, n = 70), giant (G, over 33 kg body mass, n = 53). The largest dogs surpassed the body mass of the smallest dogs at least seven times, and giant dogs weighed at least one half and toy dogs less than one tenth of the average body mass of people in the Czech human population. Despite this the majority of the studied traits regardless of body mass of the dogs showed no significant differences. In the vast majority of Czech households all dogs were considered household members, taken on travels or vacations, photographed and their birthdays were celebrated. Aggressiveness of the dogs did not correlate with their body size. Among the 84 traits of the behaviour of dogs and their owners, which were analysed, only 23, i.e. 27.4% traits were significantly related to their body mass. Larger and heavier dogs were more frequently kept in houses with yards and gardens, in rural environments. Toy and small dogs prevailed in urbanised environments, in apartments. They were allowed to use furniture, sleep in beds of household members. Moreover, toy dogs predominated in one-person households. Large dogs were more often trained, sometimes by professional trainers, obeyed commands better and were more often described as obedient. They were considered not only as companions but also as working dogs. Giant size dogs were also more often trained to be protective. These data show that the differences in the body size of dogs modified their co-existence with humans only to a limited extent.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the contribution of major mammary pathogens, as well as of coliform and Gram-negative non-coliform bacteria to standard plate counts (SPCs) of bulk tank milk samples (BTMSs). Randomly selected anonymous BTMSs were collected from 268 dairy herds (with approximately 29,000 cows) in the Czech Republic during 2007. The most frequently detected pathogens were found to be E. faecalis (16.1%; geometric mean 9.8 × 10 2 CFU/ml) and S. uberis (13.6%; 9.0 × 10 2 CFU/ml). Highly significant positive correlations ( P &lt; 0.01) between the bacterial counts of the dominant pathogens and the relevant SPC were found for E. faecalis and S. dysgalactiae , as were significant correlations ( P &lt; 0.05) for S. uberis , E. faecium , and S. aureus . Highly significant positive correlations ( P &lt; 0.01) were found between SPC and coliform count and between SPC and Gram-negative non-coliform bacteria count. The results suggest, therefore, a recent dominance of environmental pathogens especially streptococci and enterococci, over contagious mammary pathogens in BTMSs. The geometric means of SPC in BTMSs with mammary pathogen (7.7 × 10 4 CFU/ml for environmental; 7.4 × 10 4 CFU/ml for contagious pathogens) exceed significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) the geometric means of SPC of pathogen free BTMSs (4.4 × 10 4 CFU/ml). This study revealed that the major mammary pathogens contribute significantly to SPCs of BTMSs.",

The synthetic biodegradable tri-block copolymer used was the block copolymer of polyethylene glycol (PEG), polylactic acid (PLA), polyglycolic acid (PGA) (PEG-PLGA) endcapped with itaconic acid (ITA). The water-soluble carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccimide system (EDC-NHS) was chosen as the cross-linking agent used to control the rate of hydrogel resorption. Dependence of the physical properties of the prepared hydrogels on the concentration of the EDC-NHS cross-linker, reaction time and concentration of PEG-PLGA-ITA copolymer was examined. Swelling behaviour, thermal stability, surface morphology and degradation rate were also characterized. Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that increase in concentration of the cross-linking agent, as well as prolonged cross-linking time and increased amount of synthetic copolymer lead to enhanced thermal stability of the gels together with a reduced swelling ratio and degradation rate in saline. The resorption rate of these gels used in preparation of cartilage scaffolds can be controlled over a wide time interval by varying the collagen/(PEG-PLGA-ITA) blend composition or the conditions of the cross-linking reaction.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose and the haematological and non-haematological toxicity of chlorambucil in male Wistar rats. Chlorambucil (pulverized pills or pure substance) was dissolved in ethanol and administered orally at a dose ranging from 0.15 to 50 mg/kg/day for 5 days. Evaluations of experimental rats included general clinical state of health, body weight, haematological indicators (red blood cell count, white blood cell count, platelet count, differential leukocyte count, packed cell volume and haemoglobin concentration), biochemical plasma indicators (urea, creatinine, ALP, ALT, AST, Na, K, Cl), immunophenotype of leukocytes (CD3, CD8 and CD4 markers), as well as histopathology. Doses of chlorambucil from 0.15 to 0.75 mg/kg/day had no effect on the general clinical state of health as well as on other laboratory variables. Doses of 2–12 mg/kg/day were well tolerated, but mild myelotoxicity (leukopaenia) and elevated activities of liver transaminases were found. Doses of 20 to 50 mg/kg/day were myelotoxic ( p &lt; 0.01) with prevailing lymphopaenia but only minimum effects on red blood cells and platelets. Histology revealed pneumotoxicity, nephrotoxicity and damage to the gastrointestinal tract. Doses of 40 and 50 mg/kg/day resulted in acute lethal effects in 50% and 75% of individuals, respectively. Results of this study are intended for use in the testing of chlorambucil in combination with other drugs as a conditioning for bone marrow transplantation.",

Concerning the type of housing during the fattening, the lowest mortality rate during the subsequent transport to slaughter houses was detected among pigs fattened on solid floor (0.047%) and on deep bedding (0.084%). The highest mortality during transport was detected among pigs fattened on fully or partially slatted floor (0.139%), a significant difference ( p &lt; 0.01) was found compared to other housing types. Assessment of the influence of individual pig load size on mortality showed the lowest mortality among pigs transported in loads of up to 40 animals (0.053%). Mortality during the transport in loads of the size of 41 to 120 animals was 0.130%, and for loads of the size over 120 pigs the mortality rate was 0.156%. These mortality rates are significantly higher ( p &lt; 0.01) compared to the load sizes of up to 40 animals.",

However, the periodic seasonal in the region imposes restrictions to the supplement of fodder plants and, consequently, availability of nutrients in the systems of animal production. Considering that animal production is related to the consumption, nutritional value and the use efficiency of the available food, diverse methods of alimentary handling have been considered with sight to attenuate the nutritional problem of the flocks in the periods most critical of the year. The objective of this work was demonstrating some technological and scientific advances gotten in the scope of the exploration systems and nutritional handling of sheep in the semi-arid of Brazil.

This study evaluates the healing of segmental femoral defects in miniature pigs based on the radiological determination of the callus: cortex ratio at 16 weeks after ostectomy. The size of the formed callus was significantly larger ( p &lt; 0.05) in animals after transplantation of an autogenous cancellous bone graft (group A, callus : cortex ratio of 1.77 ± 0.33) compared to animals after transplantation of cylindrical scaffold from hydroxyapatite and 0.5% collagen (group S, callus : cortex ratio of 1.08 ± 0.13), or in animals after transplantation of this scaffold seeded with MSCs (group S + MSCs, callus: cortex ratio of 1.15 ± 0.18). No significant difference was found in the size of callus between animals of group S and animals of group S + MSCs. Unlike a scaffold in the shape of the original bone column, a freely placed autogenous cancellous bone graft may allow the newly formed tissue to spread more to the periphery of the ostectomy defect. Implanted cylindrical scaffolds (with and without MSCs) support callus formation directly in the center of original bone column in segmental femoral ostectomy, and can be successfully used in the treatment of large bone defects.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to observe the development of exploratory behaviour in growing broilers, i.e. their reaction to a novel environment (habituation) during the post-incubation period. Twelve males and twelve females of ROSS 308 line were kept from hatching until 42 days of age in separate pens, under identical husbandry conditions. To study their behaviour, we used the open-field test (OFT). Individual 10-min tests were initiated at the age of 3 days, and were repeated at weekly intervals, i.e. a total of 6 tests were carried out. The results were evaluated using analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures and Tukey post-hoc test. Broilers of both sexes were most active during the first OFT on day 3 after hatching. In male broilers, we found a significant decrease in all exploratory activities between the first and 2nd OFT; duration of their horizontal locomotor activity was reduced from 104 ± 51.86 s to 3.50 ± 3.50 s ( p &lt; 0.05), duration of visual orientation decreased from 327.50 ± 55.94 s to 125.00 ± 31.94 s ( p &lt; 0.001), and duration of vocalizations decreased from 412.50 ± 63.12 s to 90.00 ± 34.25 s ( p &lt; 0.001). In females, a significant decrease was observed betwen the first and 2nd OFT only in duration of horizontal locomotor activity that decreased from 234.25 ± 52.07 s to 14.25 ± 8.36 s ( p &lt; 0.001) and between the first and 3rd OFT in duration of vocalization (decreasing from 430.00 ± 66.30 s in 1st OFT to 60.00 ± 23.35 s; p &lt; 0.001). On the other hand, a significant increase in duration of comfort behaviour was noted between the first and second OFT in both sexes (in males from 95.00 ± 40.76 s to 462.50 ± 38.81 s; p &lt; 0.001; in females from 85.00 ± 31.73 s to 437.50 ± 67.74 s; p &lt; 0.001). Changes in defecation numbers were not significant in either sex. Our findings show that the most profound changes in behaviour of broiler chickens occurred between the first and second OFT, that male broilers used visual orientation in the open field arena more than females in the first test, they vocalized less in the second test, and they seem to have habituated to the novel environment earlier than females.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to analyse dog bites to children in the Czech Republic. Data were obtained from a questionnaire completed with children aged 4 to 13 years in 11 urban and rural primary schools. A total of 103 dog bites sustained by 92 children were analysed using chi square test and F test. There were 58 boys (56.3%) and 45 girls (43.7%) bitten, 57.3% of them once, 42.7% repeatedly. The evaluated answers showed that children were bitten when playing with own dogs (69.2%) or dogs known to them (30.8%) but not by unknown dogs (χ 2 = 25.397, df = 1, p &lt; 0.001). Children were bitten outdoors by loose running unknown dogs (88.5%), known dogs (11.5%) but not by own dogs (χ 2 = 55.528, df = 2, p &lt; 0.001). Thirty-two children were bitten indoors by small (53.1%), medium size (21.9) or large (25.0%) dogs. Small dogs were biting mostly indoors (51.5%), medium size (73.1%) and large (80.5%) dogs bit mostly outdoors (χ 2 = 9.0022, df = 2, p = 0.011). Most of the children that disturbed a resting or sleeping dog were bitten indoors (83.3%; χ 2 = 7.862, df = 1, p &lt; 0.01), predominantly by small dogs (83.3%, χ 2 = 7.482, df = 2, p = 0.022). When stroking a dog, children were bitten by a medium size (45.5%), large (31.8%) or small dog (22.7%; χ 2 = 5.588, df = 2, p &lt; 0.068). Children injured by their family-owned dog had accidentally caused pain to it before being bitten (83.3%; χ 2 = 7.862, df = 1, p &lt; 0.012). These children were always bitten by a small dog (χ 2 = 7.482, df = 2, p = 0.022). Three children reported deliberately causing pain to a dog – these were all small dogs (100.0%; χ 2 = 6.279, df = 2, p &lt; 0.05). Children teasing dogs were bitten most frequently by a small dog (75.0%; χ 2 = 6.98, df = 2, p &lt; 0.032). Male dogs bit more frequently (66.7%) than females (33.3%; χ 2 = 6.338, d.f. =1, p = 0.014). These data were the first ones obtained from the bitten children. They suggest that in interactions with own, known and small dogs, children were more daring. The personal space of dogs, their warning signals, and defence were underestimated, the resulting aggression was mostly of possessive, territorial and fear type. Additional suggestions are made to complete the information on preventive measures for parents, children and the public. Importantly, all information types should point out that the dog remains a predator despite its long domestication history and close co-existence with humans.",

Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate the effect of amlodipine on bone metabolism in male albino Wistar rats. Amlodipine (0.3 mg/100 g body weight; gavage) was administered to 8 rats for 8 weeks. Control group (n = 8) received aqua pro inj. (0.2 ml/100 g body weight; gavage). Bone marker concentrations of carboxy-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-I) and aminoterminal propeptide of procollagen type I in serum, and of bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP) in both serum and bone homogenate were measured by enzyme immunoassay. We investigated the expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) in proximal tibia using Western blotting, and bone mineral density was measured by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry in lumbar and caudal vertebrae and in femoral areas. Mechanical properties of the femurs were measured by three-point bending of the shaft and compression testing of the femoral neck. After 8 weeks of amlodipine administration there was a significant decrease in serum concentrations of BALP ( p = 0.0009) and CTX-I ( p = 0.003), and the content of BALP in bone homogenate ( p = 0.026) compared to the control. In addition, Western blot analysis indicated increased BMP-2 protein concentration after amlodipine administration. Our findings suggest that amlodipine has a retarding influence on bone metabolism in rats by decreasing bone turnover, which probably in consequence increases expression of BMP-2.",

The study was performed on 24 Holstein-Friesian calves of both sexes, divided into two groups. The first one was experimental group of 12 calves with symptoms of nutritional muscular dystrophy and the second one was control group of 12 clinically healthy calves administered a single i.m. injection of vitamin E + selenium preparation on the second day after birth. Blood samples were collected from all animals 3 × at 7-day intervals, starting on day 5. Blood serum was subjected to biochemical analyses to determine Se and vitamin E concentrations, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase activity levels. The activity of glutathione peroxidase was determined in whole blood samples. Electrocardiographic assessment was performed on day 19 in all calves. In the group of calves with symptoms of nutritional muscular dystrophy, serum Se and vitamin E concentrations were significantly ( P ≤ 0.01) lower than in control, the same was true for the activity of glutathione peroxidase ( P ≤ 0.01). The changes were accompanied by an increase ( P ≤ 0.01) in the activity of aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. The electrocardiograms of experimental animals revealed elevated heart rate, accelerated sinus rhythm, increased P wave amplitude, shorter PR, QT and ST interval, narrower QRS complex, shorter T wave duration and insignificantly increased T wave amplitude; these results were indicative of arrhythmia which is observed at early stages of cardiomyopathy.

    "abstract": "Haematological analyses were conducted in gynogenetic diploids and control diploids of Siberian sturgeon ( Acipenser baerii ). Gynogenetic diploid fish were obtained from Polish aquaculture after induction of meiotic gynogenesis based on application of UV-irradiated hybrid Siberian sturgeon × Russian sturgeon ( A. gueldenstaedtii ) sperm (for eggs activation) and heat shock for inhibiting the second polar body retention. A total of fifteen 30-month-old specimens of Siberian sturgeon from the gynogenetic diploid group and 12 specimens from the control diploid group were randomly sampled. There were no differences in the number of erythrocytes and haematocrit values between gynogenetic diploids and normal diploids of Siberian sturgeon. However, the percentage of normal erythrocytes was lower in the gynogenetic group of fish and the higher percentage of the atypical red blood cell forms (microcytes, sphaerocytes, erythrocytes with displaced nuclei and with divided nuclei) were observed in this group of fish. Additionally all the haemoglobin indices (haemoglobin concentration, the mean corpuscular haemoglobin and the mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration) were significantly reduced in gynogenetic diploids of Siberian sturgeon. These results could suggest depletion of oxygenation capacity of the blood of gynogenetic sturgeons. This is the first report of a haematological study in gynogenetic diploids of sturgeon fish.",

    "abstract": "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a highly important human pathogen that is also a significant concern in veterinary medicine. Despite the high prevalence of colonization, clinical infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus appear to be rare in pigs. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from a sow with endometritis and her five piglets with dermatitis originating from a Serbian farm. Identification of the strains was done by automated system and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction for mec A and nuc genes. Detection of Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome mec type was performed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing on erythromycin, clindamycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin was done by disc diffusion method. Six isolated strains from the infected sow and her piglets showed resistance only to tetracycline beside resistance to all beta-lactam antibiotics. In the tested methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates, Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome mec type V was present. To our knowledge, this finding is the first documented detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from pigs’ clinical samples in Serbia. The results of our study indicate the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in a pig farm in Serbia highlighting the threat of this antibiotic-resistant microorganism as a pathogen causing both animal and human infections.",

In total, developmental stages of reproductive organs of gilts of two breeds Polish Large White (n = 100) and Polish Landrace (n = 100) were used. The animals were divided into three groups depending on their daily gains (≤ 850 g, 851 - 1000 g and &gt; 1000 g). Feed efficiency was similar in each group, and amounted to 2.91, 2.57 and 2.34 kg/kg, respectively. Meat content in carcass demonstrated significant differences ( P ≤ 0.01) between three groups for the Polish Landrace breed (61%, 61% and 59.2%, respectively).

Similarly to ovarian volume, ovarian weight showed significant differences ( P ≤ 0.01; P ≤ 0.05), however disproportionately to the rate of growth. The most favourable properties have been demonstrated in the Polish Large White characterized by moderate growth rate ( P ≤ 0.01). Research on the scope of the assessment growth and development of the reproductive system of prepubertal gilts is very limited. Thus, this study brings important data about factors affecting morphometrical characteristics of the uteri, ovaries and oviducts of gilts.",

The basal diets (BDs) for Groups 1 and 2 were supplemented with the equivalent amounts of trace elements in an inorganic form (Cu sulphate 5 mg·kg -1 DM, Fe sulphate, Zn oxide, Mn oxide 50 mg·kg -1 DM), however sodium selenite or selenized yeast (Sel-Plex) were given at a dose of Se 0.3 mg·kg -1 DM, respectively. Groups 3 and 4 received the same BD´s but with the substantially reduced amount of supplemented nutrients in the organic “proteinated” form (Bioplex Cu 2.5 mg·kg -1 DM, Bioplex Fe, Bioplex Zn, Bioplex Mn 10 mg·kg -1 DM), except for selenium that was given at a dose of Se 0.3 mg·kg -1 DM as sodium selenite or Sel-Plex, respectively. The supplementation of restricted doses of trace elements in the organic forms into the diet did not affect studied haematological, immunological, enzymatic indices. At the age of 21 days, the activity of GSH-Px was significantly higher in the groups supplemented with sodium selenite later no differences due to the administered form of Se were found. This indicates that the GSH-Px activity reached a plateau in all groups of broilers at the 21, 35 and 42 day, except for GSH-Px activity in the groups of birds supplemented with selenized yeast on day 21. In Addition, significant age dependent changes were observed in blood chemistry, but the different treatments did not influence these changes. Base on our results, the doses of organic forms of trace elements supplemented into the diets for poultry can be restricted to 50% (Bioplex Cu) and 20% (Bioplex Fe, Bioplex Zn and Bioplex Mn) without influencing the blood chemistry of broilers.",

However, the only truly reliable method is gastropexy, most often as part of a surgical treatment of GDV. Gastropexy may be performed preventively either during laparotomy indicated for another reason than GDV, or newly laparoscopically, as independent preventive gastropexy. Preventive laparoscopic assisted gastropexy (PLAG) was performed in 17 patients at the Department of Surgery and Orthopaedics of the Small Animal Clinic at the University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences in Brno. Clinical results and complications of PLAG were evaluated 3-12 months after surgery. The most frequent clinical finding of PLAG was a skinfold at the site of gastropexy immediately after the surgery (n = 8; 47%), or still on day 12 after the surgery (n = 1; 6%). As for PLAG complications, in one case a seroma formation was found at the site of gastropexy (6%); in two patients iatrogenic perforation of the splenic capsule (12%) occurred, which in one case gave reason to converting laparoscopy into laparotomy (6%). In none of the patients, death, gastropexy failure, GDV development, dehiscence, infection of or haemorrhage from the surgical wound were noted. Laparoscopic assisted gastropexy appears as a reliable and miniinvasive surgical method of GDV prevention and it may be recommended for high-risk breeds of dogs.",

Positive specimens amounting to 173 (9%) were found annually in five species of rodents such as Apodemus sp. , Clethrionomys glareolus, Microtus arvalis, Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus . The recognised leptospiral serotypes included L. grippotyphosa, L. bulgarica, L. sejroe and L. icterohaemorrhagiae/copenhageni . The highest prevalence of antibodies was against the L. grippotyphosa serotype (92.8%). Reactions with other serotypes of leptospires were exceptional. Reactions with L. bulgarica antigen were only due to coagglutination with L. grippotyphosa leptospires . The titres ranged from 100 to 12,800. However, lower values up to the titre of 800 predominated in 151 cases (83.4%). There were non-significant sex differences in seroprevalence with 8.1% and 7.6% prevalence in males and females, respectively. Marked differences were, however, found in seroprevalence of juveniles and adults with 3.3% and 10.2%, respectively. Adult males and females were seropositive in 10.9% and 9.5%, respectively; juveniles were seropositive only in 3.0% and 3.7%. The highest percentage of specimens (43.6%) was examined during July and August. The summer seroprevalence of 10.9% was higher than in spring and autumn. Our results revealed the persistence of both natural and synanthropic nidi of leptospirosis in the region under study and demonstrated epidemiological implications regarding health protection of animals and humans.",

    "abstract": "Although a large diversity of mastitis-causing bacteria (150 species, subspecies or biovars) have been documented, an adequate and simple mycological screening for yeast-related mastitis has not been developed. Since yeast incubation normally lasts longer than the majority of bacteriological ones, usually a treatment is administered before the results of microbial cultures are obtained. Therefore, a simple test has been needed for detection of yeast-related mastitis, the results of which can be read in parallel to bacteriological screening. Application of Microstix®-Candida assay was first checked for its specificity in standard Candida albicans (Oxford strain) cultures (phase I) and then in the other 36 strains of yeasts isolated from clinical mastitis cases during field investigations (second phase). Next, a test was implemented for identification of pathogens in 9 cohorts (1,200 cows) from red-white Polish- Friesian breed in which the dynamics of mastitis were traced by bacteriological and mycological assays along year-long observations. The data obtained showed that apart from frequent infections (~50-70%) proved by using pure microbial cultures, also mixed (bacterial-fungal) infections (0-25%) appeared as well as negative sieves (in the range of 0-45%). Mycological assays revealed a significant fraction of mixed infections during both lactation and the dry period. Strepto-staphylococcal infection was thus identified, however, its proportion strongly decreased after the introduction of antibiotics (after sensitivity to microbial agents was determined). Microbial monitoring was improved in these herds by parallel application of bacteriological and mycological (particularly Microstix®- Candida) tests. Microstix®-assay appears to be useful for mycological diagnosis in field conditions of infected (mastitis) herds. Its advantages include easy performance and short incubation time that is only 24 h at 37 °C (72-96 h at room temperature). This allowed demonstrating the cow’s udder yeast infection simultaneously with the first reading of bacterial cultures. Its specificity was confirmed against standard Candida Oxford strain, and sensitivity (100%) was confirmed in mycological cultures (36 strains) and biochemical assays.",

Latencies of waves I, III and V, and intervals I–III, I–V and III–V were recorded. Monaural and binaural stimulation of the cats were done with sounds ranging between 40 and 90 decibel Sound Pressure Level. All latencies were lower than those described in previous studies, where needle electrodes were used. In the case of binaural stimulation, latencies of waves III and V were greater compared to those obtained for monaural stimulation ( P &lt; 0.01), and relatively unchanged for wave I ( P &gt; 0.05). Regardless of the sound intensity, the interwave latency was constant ( P &gt; 0.05). Interestingly, no differences were noticed for latencies of waves III and V when sound intensity was higher than 80dB SPL. This study completes the knowledge in the field of electrophysiology and shows that the brainstem auditory evoked potentials in cats using surface electrodes is a viable method to record the transmission of auditory information. That can be faithfully used in clinical practice, when small changes of latency values may be an objective factor in health status evaluation.",

Under certain conditions it is possible to detect the addition of water to milk. It is necessary to have the right FPD limit in legislation for milk quality control. The aim of this study was to improve the estimation procedure of this limit. Apart from factors related to dairy cow nutrition, cattle breed and milk yield, it is important to take into account CO 2 (6%), water steam evaporation and pasteurization under technological conditions. Bulk milk samples (1, 30, 6, 6, 10, 1 according to experiment) from Holstein and Czech Fleckvieh breed (1:1) were used in the experiments and technologically treated. The effects of water addition (water saturated and unsaturated by CO 2 ), carbon dioxide evaporation and pasteurization (80 °C for 22 min) were quantified. Pasteurization aggravation of FPD was -0.00394 ± 0.00171 ºC ( P &lt; 0.001). Aggravation due to carbon dioxide evaporation could be -0.00383 ± 0.00095 ºC ( P &lt; 0.001) depending on practice. Increase in FPD is recorded after milking during technological procedures of milk storage, mixing, pumping, transport shaking and warming. During FPD shift, the acuteness of FPD data sets increases. This fact should be considered in the process of deriving standard raw cow milk FPD limits. Similar experimental analysis of milk FPD technological shifts has not been performed in this way until now.",

Significant reduction of excretion of the 3 viruses in vaccinated animals was a consistent finding, demonstrating the efficacy of the vaccine. Reducing shedding is indeed key to interrupting the infection transmission chain and helping to achieve the protective effects of immunisation that extend beyond the individual. A significant reduction of clinical signs and lung lesions following the Mannheimia haemolytica challenge was also observed in vaccinated animals versus controls. Comparison of the challenge strains to an array of global and European strains, including recent ones, demonstrated a high genetic proximity, supporting the potential for the vaccine to maintain similar levels of efficacy in the field over a 6-month period post vaccination.",

    "abstract": "The main goal of this study was to evaluate the health condition of dairy cows in relationship to milk production and milk composition using continuous monitoring boluses. In total, seven Holstein cows had boluses implemented for monitoring rumen pH and temperature every 15 min with an accuracy of ± 0.1 pH/ °C. Milk production test day records were noted by Breeding Services of Slovakia, s.e. (state-owned enterprise) 5 × per each cow with a bolus over 27 weeks of lactation. Dairy cows were divided into three groups according to their mean daily pH. After that, the test day records with the selected group were paired. Only two cows had pH values within the normal pH intervals during the control days. Consequently, there was found to be a 6.8% ( P &lt; 0.05) decrease in daily milk production in cows with lowered pH compared to cows with normal pH. Furthermore, there was found to be a 14.08% ( P &lt; 0.05) decrease in daily milk production in cows with an increased pH compared to cows with normal pH. Narrower fat to protein ratio and lactose content was found in cows with decreased and increased ruminal pH. The lowest milk fat concentration ( P &lt; 0.05) but the highest somatic cell count and urea content were determined in cows with decreased pH. These results show that continuous monitoring of rumen environment is a suitable method for nutrition and health management in dairy herds and allows the nutritionist to make nutritional interventions for pH stabilization within normal range in order to keep good milk production and high milk quality.",

    "abstract": "The present review summarizes results of experiments, mostly performed on rodents, regarding the effects of fish oil (FO) and its biologically active constituents, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), on the healing of cutaneous wounds, but also of selected other types of injury. Structure, metabolism and functions of EPA/DHA in an organism are briefly mentioned, with an emphasis on the ability of these long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids to modulate inflammation. Wound healing as a complex programmed sequence of cellular and molecular processes including inflammation, cell migration, angiogenesis, synthesis of provisional matrix, collagen deposition and reepithelialisation is briefly described. Markers for evaluation of the healing process include planimetry indices, tensile strength, quantification of collagen synthesis including hydroxyproline determination, histopathology/immunohistochemistry and genomic/proteomic markers. As far as effects on wound healing are concerned, the main emphasis is put on the outcomes of experiments using a dietary FO/DHA/EPA administration, but the results of experiments with a parenteral application are also mentioned, together with selected relevant in vitro studies. An important conclusion from the above-mentioned studies is an inconsistency of FO/DHA/EPA effects on wound healing: decreased/increased collagen deposition; lower/higher counts of the inflammatory cells in the healing tissue; increased/decreased concentration of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines; DHA accelerated/delayed wound healing process. Some experiments indicate superiority of DHA over EPA regarding wound healing.",

    "abstract": "Dirofilaria immitis is a worldwide spread nematode affecting the pulmonary artery and the heart of dogs (rarely reported in cats), especially in areas where the dogs show a high prevalence of infection. Angiostrongylus chabaudi is, in turn, a cardiopulmonary nematode of felids identified in several southern European countries and Germany. Co-infections of Dirofilaria immitis and Angiostrongylus spp. are known only in canids. We report a case of D . immitis and A . chabaudi co-infection in a road-killed wildcat originating from Southeastern Romania. Overall, 17 nematodes were collected from the pulmonary arteries of the wildcat and were morphologically identified as A . chabaudi (2 males and 15 females). Another nematode was collected from the right ventricle and identified as adult male D . immitis . Genomic DNA was extracted from one nematode of each of the two species and a fragment of the cox 1 gene was amplified and sequenced. The sequences obtained from the nematodes showed 100% similarity to a sequence of A . chabaudi isolated from Romania (Accession number KU521521) and to various D . immitis sequences from Europe, Asia and Australia (e.g. KT716014, EU159111, AJ537512). This is the first report of A . chabaudi and D . immitis co-infection in a felid, revealing the possibility of similar situations in domestic cats. This requires a more in-depth clinical and laboratory examination of animals with respiratory and cardiac symptoms.",

The surface colour of skin (L*a*b*), ammonia content, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances content (TBARS) and antioxidant capacity were assessed. The lightness values (L*) for chicken skin in MAP-O 2 were increased on days 7 and 10 of the storage period, and were significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) higher than in the samples in MAP-N 2 and the control. Significant increases of TBARS were observed in the samples in MAP-O 2 from day 7 and these values continued to increase until the end of the storage period. The antioxidant capacities of the samples in MAP-O 2 were mostly lower than those of the samples in MAP-N 2 . Our results indicate that MAP-O 2 only had a positive effect on skin colour, whereas MAP-N 2 maybe preferable for shelf-life prolongation.",

The aim of the current study was to assess the importance of EHV-2 infection in the aetiopathogenesis of ocular disease, where the applied treatment failed. Seventy-eight horses with nonhealing ocular disease were examined at the Equine Clinic of the University of Veterinary Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Brno, Czech Republic, between the years 2009 and 2016. In total, 96 conjunctival swabs were taken and, starting from 2014, peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) were also examined in 42 patients. Positive EHV-2 results were detected in 53 ocular swab samples (54.64%) and in 22 PBL samples (51.16%). The horses were divided into three groups according to age, up to 3 years, from 3 to 15 years and older than 15 years. Depending on the clinical presentation, horses were also divided into nonulcerative or ulcerative keratitis, keratouveitis, keratoconjunctivitis, and corneal degeneration groups. The group of young horses had a significantly higher ocular swab positivity compared to the middle group ( P = 0.01). Increased bilateral ocular occurrence with decreasing age was observed, although it was not significant ( P = 0.04). Significant correlation was confirmed between PBL samples and ocular swabs ( P = 0.01). This correlation was even higher in cases of bilateral infection. No significant differences were detected when comparing the groups according to the clinical presentation. This study describes the prevalence of EHV-2 in different age group horses with non-healing keratopathies.",

Even benign neoplasia often represents great inconvenience due to potential restrictions of therapeutic surgical approach in this area. Whereas in human medicine, there are statistical data describing areas of the oral cavity, that are more prevalent for development of particular neoplasia, in veterinary medicine, these data are not yet available. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of tumours in dogs with oral neoplasia, the occurrence site of the most common neoplastic lesions in the canine oral cavity, as well as the effect of age and sex on the prevalence of these lesions. In this study we investigated oral tumorous lesions from 659 dogs, out of which 352 lesions were diagnosed as tumours and 307 as tumour-like lesions. The most common tumours encountered were melanoma (42%, n = 148), squamous cell carcinoma (16%, n = 57) and canine acanthomatous ameloblastoma (10%, n = 35). The median age of dogs with oral neoplasia was 9.9 years, with the range of 0.2 to 17.5 years. There was no significant association between sex and the type of oral lesion (tumorous and tumour-like). Melanoma was most commonly present in the caudal maxillary region, squamous cell carcinoma on the mouth floor, canine acanthomatous ameloblastoma in the area of the rostral mandible, plasmacytoma on the tongue, osteosarcoma was most often diagnosed in the caudal parts of oral cavity and fibrosarcoma did not have a specific site of occurrence.",

In the experiment, 232 chicks of common pheasants ( Phasianus colchicus ) were used. In the course of the experiment, the required number of pheasants was randomly selected for analysis at regular 10-day intervals. The age of pheasant chicks had a significant effect on the content of all fatty acids. Significant changes in the proportion of fatty acid groups were recorded mainly at 20, 40 and 60 days of age. By 20 days of age the proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids decreased considerably in relation to the increase in the content of polyunsaturated fatty acids, while the n6/n3 ratio decreased markedly. The content of monounsaturated fatty acids increased between day 20 and day 40, causing a simultaneous decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acids. From day 40, the monounsaturated fatty acid content increased gradually till the end of fattening, whereas the reverse trend was observed in the saturated fatty acid content in this period. As for polyunsaturated fatty acids, their presence increased from day 40 to day 60, followed by a gradual decrease till the end of fattening. The results of our work showed the different ability of pheasants to digest and utilize particular fatty acids with varying efficiency throughout their growth. The study brings new findings concerning changes in fatty acid composition of pheasants during fattening.",

The aim of this study was to characterize the relationship between mechanical properties of the equine metacarpal bone and its biomechanical and morphometric properties. Third metacarpal bones were extracted from horses euthanized unrelated to musculoskeletal conditions. In total, bone specimens from 26 front limbs of 13 horses (7.8 ± 5.8 years old) including Lipizzaner (n = 5), Hungarian Warmblood (n = 2), Holsteiner (n = 2), Thoroughbred (n = 1), Hungarian Sporthorse (n = 1), Friesian (n = 1), and Shagya Arabian (n = 1) were collected. The horses included 7 mares, 4 stallions and 2 geldings. Assessment of the bone mineral density of the whole bone across four specific regions of interest was performed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The bones were scanned using a computer tomographic scanner to measure cross-sectional morphometric properties such as bone mineral density and cross-sectional dimensions including cortical area and cortical width. Mechanical properties (breaking force, bending strength, elastic modulus) were determined by a 3-point bending test. Significant positive linear correlations were found between the breaking force and bone mineral density of the entire third metacarpal bones ( P &lt; 0.001, r = 0.72), the medial cortex region of interest ( P &lt; 0.001, r = 0.68) and the transverse region of interest ( P &lt; 0.001, r = 0.61).

For this purpose, blood sera from 460 sheep were tested for antibodies against BDV using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Since BDV causes persistent infection, antigen-ELISA was also performed for this agent. Seropositivity rate was detected to be 74.57%. In addition, the BDV antigen was detected in one sample of seronegative sera (0.85%). Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique was used to determine the presence of pestivirus nucleic acid by using 5’UTR primer pair. Pestivirus nucleic acid was found in 2 of 117 seronegative samples (1.71%) by RT-PCR. The results suggest that the infection was spreading in private small scale production units. Furthermore, recommendations for the control of BDV infection are presented.

The presence of certain species of Salmonella in reptiles is consistent with them being the source of contamination in some cases of human disease. Thus, Salmonella positive animals can be a potential public health concern even more when strains acquire resistance to antibiotics. The nature and extent of Salmonella harboured by different species of reptiles commonly kept in captivity are not known. The aims of this study were to analyse the incidence of Salmonella species in cloacae as an indicator of the intestinal flora in a cohort of healthy captive bred female veiled chameleons. A cloacal sample was taken from each of fifteen healthy captive bred, adult female veiled chameleons that were housed at a teaching and research clinic. Salmonella isolates were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and positive cases were serotyped by slide agglutination test. Salmonella organisms were detected in 12 chameleons. Eighty percent of chameleons harboured 1 of 4 subspecies and serovars of Salmonella .

The aim of the present study was to determine isolation and identification rates of Dichelobacter nodosus and Fusobacterium necrophorum in the culture techniques and reveal the specificity and sensitivity of the culture technique based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method in sheep with footrot. Dry swabs and swabs with Amies medium from 83 sheep were subjected to PCR and culture analyses. In dry swabs, 4 samples were positive for F. necrophorum and all were negative for D. nodosus . Colonies in Eugon and Fusobacterium selective agars from swabs with Amies medium were evaluated. Polymerase chain reaction analysis was conducted on macroscopically and microscopically unidentified samples. The positivity rate was 55.4% for D. nodosus and 69.8% for F. necrophorum in cultures from Fusobacterium selective agars. The positivity rate for D. nodosus in Fusobacterium selective agars was higher than that in Eugon agar. Performing PCR and culture methods increased positivity as compared to performing them alone. In comparison with the PCR method, culturing in Fusobacterium selective agars had moderate sensitivity and low specificity for D. nodosus (71.7 and 28.7%) and F. necrophorum (61.3 and 80.0%), respectively. In conclusion, Fusobacterium selective agar (without antibiotics) for isolation and identification of D. nodosus is superior to Eugon agar. Fusobacterium necrophorum should also be considered as a provoking agent for footrot in small ruminants. The PCR method on culture increases elucidation of definitive aetiology.",

The first isolation from aquarium fish was recorded in the case of M. kansasii and the second isolation in the case of M. simiae ; both should also be taken into account as aetiological agents of mycobacterial infections in humans. The measures to reduce mycobacterial infections in both fish and humans should include monitoring water mains as possible sources of M. kansasii infections, compliance with the sanitation principles in handling fish suspected of being infected and the content of tanks (molluscs, water, plants), and the introduction of strict veterinary inspection of imported fish, fish from aquarist shops and from large-scale distributors.",

The aim of this investigation was to determine, by monitoring primary microclimatic conditions, the possible association of the number of fattening pigs per unit of housing space with species diversity and number of airborne microorganisms. The research was conducted at a fattening and finishing facility of 450 m 2 (equipped with 44 pens designed for 10 animals each) with low-pressure ventilation in three different trials. The first trial was conducted during the autumn-winter period with the capacity of 440 animals (0.7 m 2 of pen area per fattening pig), the second trial was conducted during the winter-spring period with 356 animals (0.8 m 2 of pen area per fattening pig), and the third trial was conducted during the spring-summer period with 312 animals (1.0 m 2 of pen area per fattening pig). The air samples for isolation of fungi and mesophilic, haemolytic, and coliform bacteria were taken and microclimatic conditions were monitored during each trial at the same consecutive weekly periods. According to the data obtained from all trials, the total number of bacteria and fungi did not exceed 10 4 and 10 3 CFU per m 3 , respectively. The most numerous were gram-positive bacteria, followed by gram-negative bacteria and fungi. The total number of airborne microorganisms correlates significantly (at p &lt; 0.05) with porcine housing density. These data may be useful for the assessment of housing density at fattening facilities that will not compromise swine health and welfare regarding the microbiological air quality, and thus may contribute to the implementation of optimal rearing conditions in large-scale animal producing units.",

    "abstract": "The aim of our experimental work was to study whether carvedilol is able to protect renal tissue from cyclosporine toxic effect in animal model of cyclosporine nephropathy. The study was performed on twenty Wistar rats divided in two experimental groups: control (treated with placebo) and carvedilol (treated with p.o. dose 10mg/kg/day in 1 ml solution). Cyclosporine in oral dose of 15 mg/kg/day was administered to all animals during 15 days of experiment. Urine was collected daily for the assessment of diuresis, proteinuria, and determination of urea and creatinine levels. Serum collected at the end of the experiment (day 15) was used for the determination of urea and transferrin levels. The level of renal tissue damage was evaluated by the Jones method for basal membranes, glomeruli and tubuli impregnation, and by the Kossa method for calcium impregnation. For the determination of paranuclear inclusions presence we used chromanilinblue (CAB) method. Statistically significant differences between total protein levels in urine on day 7 of the experiment and urea levels in serum at the end of the experiment in the control group and the carvedilol-treated group indicate a protective effect of carvedilol on renal tissue, which is supported also by the results of a histological examination of renal tissue. Significant increase in the serum transferrin level was registered in the carvedilol-treated group and no significant changes were noted in ceruloplasmin serum levels. In conclusion, our pilot study showed that carvedilol has the ability to protect renal tissue from cyclosporine induced nephropathy in rats.",

    "abstract": "To determine the prevalence of campylobacter species in gallbladder of sheep in Van, (Eastern) Turkey, a total of 220 gallbladder samples from healthy slaughtered sheep were examined bacteriologically in October 2000 and 2002. Of the 110 samples examined each year, 27 (24.6%) and 24 (21.8%) campylobacter strains were isolated, respectively. Of the 27 campylobacter strains isolated in the year 2000, 14 (51.9%) were identified as C. jejuni , 7 (25.9%) C. fetus , 3 (11.1%) C. coli and 3 (11.1%) C. lari . Similar results were obtained in the study performed in 2002, but C. lari could not be isolated. Growth and biochemical characteristics of all identified Campylobacter species with some exceptions were typical of each species. Six of 13 examined C. fetus strains grew well at both 25 °C and 42 °C in thioglycollate medium and on blood agar. C. jejuni strains differed from C. coli only by Na-hippurate hydrolysis test. Results of the present study revealed that C. jejuni is the most common campylobacter species isolated from gallbladders of sheep. The thermophilic campylobacters in significant proportions may cause contamination of carcass during slaughter and transmission of the food-borne pathogens to humans.",

    "abstract": "Relations between polymorphism of the Growth Hormone gene and semen characters were analyzed. The DNA for the purpose of examination was isolated from the peripheral blood of 173 boars. In the boar herd under study the frequency of allele occurrence for the GH/Msp I was as follows: allele GH A - 0.79 and allele GH B - 0.21. As far as the GH/Hae II polymorphism is concerned, the relevant frequency was as follows: allele GH A - 0.53 and allele GH B - 0.47, respectively. The relationship between the GH genotypes and semen characteristic traits were analyzed. The study showed that boars with GH B GH B genotype of both polymorphous loci of the GH gene produced ejaculates of larger volume, higher percentage, number of normozosperms in the ejaculate and number of insemination as compared to GH A GH A and GH A GH B boars. Our current findings suggested that polymorphism of the GH/Msp I and GH/Hae II might have potential effect for reproductive performance traits of boars.",

As a direct control we used histopathological evaluation and microbial cultivation of samples obtained by percutaneous Tru-Cut biopsy. Evaluating our data, we found that for establishing proper diagnosis by means of cytology, less invasive catheter biopsy (CB 75.86%) is at least comparable to already proven ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (USG-FNAB 72.41%), while catheter biopsy (CB 13 cases out of 29) was significantly ( p &lt; 0.0001) more sensitive in actual identification of infectious agents than ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (USG-FNAB 2 cases of 29).We believe that an early microbial evaluation of patients suffering from prostatic disorders helps to target antimicrobial treatment in the beginning of therapy, reducing the risk of failure due to bacterial resistance.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluates the effects of different oxygen concentrations on the toxicity of complex cyanobacterial biomass and aqueous extract of two cyanobacterial samples (prepared with regard to the content of the most studied cyanobacterial toxin microcystin: biomass 1 with the content of microcystins 2 560 μg l -1 of dry weight and biomass 2 with the content of microcystins 70 μg l -1 of dry weight, i.e. almost 37-times lower concentration) during embryonal development of carp ( Cyprinus carpio ). Effects of complex biomass and aqueous extract were tested at concentrations 120, 80 and 40 mg l -1 in four replicates, two of them aerated and two without aeration. The studied endpoints included the beginning and the end of embryo hatching, the presence of eye points at 48 h after fertilization, filling of air bladder, cumulative mortality and glutathione- S -transferase (GST) activities in surviving embryos. There was a significant increase in mortality in all variants without aeration after exposure to cyanobacterial biomass and aqueous extract ( p &lt; 0.01). The variants with aeration at greater cyanobacterial concentrations also lead to a significant mortality increase ( p &lt; 0.05). There was a decreased number of hatched embryos or no hatching at all in the non-aerated exposure variants for both biomasses. The lack of eye pigmentation 48 h after fertilization was observed at biomass concentrations of 120 and 80 mg l -1 for all non-aerated biomass exposures. There were fewer individuals with filled air bladder at the greatest tested concentrations of the complex biomass (biomass 1 and 2) and concentration of 80 mg l -1 (biomass 1) in the aerated variants. The activity of detoxification enzyme GST was studied during the experiment. GST activity was increased in treatments compared to control group in all aerated variants, but the changes were not always significant. The results of the conducted experiments clearly showed the important impact of oxygen saturation in water on the extent of cyanobacterial biomass toxicity. Mortality of fish eggs and embryos in experimental groups without aeration was significantly higher than in groups with aeration. Apart from the influence of toxic substances contained in the cyanobacterial biomass and the crude extract, oxygen deficiency affected the mortality in the groups without aeration.",

    "abstract": "An impaction is an accumulation of dehydrated ingesta in a portion of the digestive tract. Impactions are among the most common gastrointestinal diseases in horses and the most common causes of equine colic. Impactions are typically formed at sites where the intestinal diameter decreases, as pelvic flexure and the transition from the right dorsal colon to the transverse colon. Additionally, impactions can occur at sites that contain sphincters, such as the ileo–cecal–colical orifice. The specific pathogenesis for impactions is not fully understood, although risk factors have been identified for several types of impactions. Medical treatment is the first choice for large colon impaction, at least in the majority of cases and includes withholding feed until the impaction passes, rehydrating the ingesta, and, if necessary, administering analgesic agents. When medical treatment fails, surgical treatment is indicated. The fatality rate depends on a series of factors such as the anatomical location and etiology of the impaction.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Acute abdomen, impaction, equine, gastrointestinal tract.",

Testicular peritubular smooth muscle cells have been characterised in detail especially in rodents and humans. The aim of our study was to assess the distribution of peritubular contractile cells of the canine tubuli seminiferi, rete testis channels, ductuli efferentes, and ductus epididymidis by immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy and to classify these cells with respect to their possible physiological function. The entire tubular system of the canine testis and epididymis is surrounded by contractile cells expressing smooth muscle actin, smooth muscle myosin and desmin, which are enveloped, at least partly, by a basal lamina. Some contractile cells of the tubuli seminiferi, rete channels, and efferent ducts and sometimes also single peritubular cells of the ductus epididymidis express vimentin. Contractile cells of seminiferous tubules and efferent ducts represent an intermediate cell type exhibiting characteristics of both smooth muscle cells (SMC) and myofibroblasts, those of rete channels stellate myofibroblasts, and those of the ductus epididymidis SMC. Differences in structure and arrangement of the contractile cells between seminiferous tubules, rete channels, efferent ducts, and ductus epididymidis suggest different functions. Myofibroblasts and contractile cells similar to them could be mainly responsible for the maintenance of an appropriate tissue turgor, whereas contraction of SMC of the ductus epididymidis might cause propulsion of spermatozoa by peristaltic waves.",

    "abstract": "The growth rate and bone metabolism indicators were monitored in broiler chickens receiving the feed supplemented with clinoptilolite. One-day-old broiler chickens ROSS 308 were divided into control (C) and experimental (E) groups with 100 males and 100 females per group. The chickens received the complete feed mixture BR1 from 1 to 10 days of age, followed by the feed mixture BR2 until the age of 30 days, and the feed mixture BR3 until the end of the experiment (40 days). The feed mixtures of the experimental group were supplemented with clinoptilolite (commercial additive ZeoFeed) at a level of 0.5% (BR1), 1.5% (BR2) and 2.5% (BR3), replacing the corresponding portion of wheat. Feed mixtures and drinking water were provided ad libitum . The live weight of broiler chickens in both the control and experimental group increased steadily during the experiment. At the end of the experiment, live weights of experimental females (2,416 g) and males (2,829 g) were higher than those of control females (2,345 g) and males (2,694 g) by 3% and 5%, respectively. Significant differences in the live weight between groups were found from the age of 30 days ( P ⪬ 0.05 and P ⪬ 0.01). At the age of 40 days, the chickens were slaughtered and the femur and tibiotarsus of the right leg were analysed for the content of dry matter, ash, calcium, phosphorus and magnesium. The ash content in dry matter ranged from 53.0 to 54.1% in group C and from 51.7 to 53.2% in group E. The Ca and P contents in dry matter in group E were lower than those in group C, except for Ca and P in the male tibiotarsus. In both groups, regardless of sex, the ash content was higher in the tibiotarsus than in the femur. Since fat levels in bones of the experimental group were increased (females by 19.5% in the femur and 21.3% in the tibiotarsus; males by 22.0% in the femur and 26.3% in the tibiotarsus), which could affect the values obtained, ash, calcium, phosphorus and magnesium were determined in the fat-free dry matter. The trends found in the originally determined dry matter were maintained, i.e. lower levels of ash, Ca, and P in the experimental group, except for male Ca in both kinds of bones. The corresponding levels in the fat-free dry matter were relatively higher as compared to the original dry matter. The results of the study showed that up to 2.5% of clinoptilolite in the diet had no adverse effect on performance and bone metabolism indicators of growing broiler chickens. Thus, it can be used as a suitable feed additive to broiler diets due to its positive effect on nutrient utilization, mechanism of digestion and pollutant elimination in connection with food safety issues.",

All pigs were sedated with a mix of tiletamin-zolazepam-ketamin-xylazin, put into total anaesthesia using propofol, and connected to an anaesthesiology unit (O 2 -Air). For 40 min we logged the heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), haemoglobin saturation by oxygen (SpO 2 ) and end-tidal CO 2 concentration (ETCO 2 ) values. Ten minutes after connecting to the devices, the pigs in the BUT group were intravenously administered butorphanol (0.2 mg/kg) in the total volume of 2 ml, or physiological saline in the same volume. The pigs in the BUT group had a lower ( p &lt; 0.05) HR in 5 th , 10 th and 25 th min, and a lower RR in the 10 th , 15 th and 20 th min. MAP, ETCO 2 and SpO 2 values did not differ substantially.

After 6 months of storage in laboratory conditions, we determined in experimental silages the content of dry matter ranging from 608.9 to 613 g kg -1 . The significantly lower content of crude fibre was detected in silages with additives. In silages ensiled with additives we detected the highest content of nitrogen-free extract in variant B (834.3 g kg -1 of DM, P &lt; 0.05). A similar effect was determined also in the content of starch; significant differences were detected in variants A1 and B ( P &lt; 0.05) compared to the control variant. We detected a significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) higher content of total sugars in trial silages; the highest content was in variant A2 (6.1 g kg -1 of DM). In the trial variants we determined significantly the lowest content of acetic acid in variant B (2.82 g kg -1 of DM). In case of butyric acid, whose content in the control variant was 0.22 g kg -1 of DM, we detected the lowest content in variant A1 conserved with homo- and heterofermentative species of lactic acid bacteria. The lowest content of ammonia was determined in silages of variant B (0.074 g kg -1 of DM). We found lower concentrations of DON and FUM (P &gt; 0.05) after the application of biological and biochemical silage additives. In concentration of T-2 toxin we detected a significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) lower value in variant A1. In concentration of AFL we found significant differences between variants A1 and B, as well as in concentration of OT between untreated control variant (UC) and variants conserved by additives.

These complications may lead to the death of the patient. We performed clinical and laboratory investigations in 161 dogs with an intervertebral disc disease. After that, we performed a cranial (n = 31), caudal (n = 125) or both (n = 5) types of myelography at the same time, and surgery - ventral slot decompression (SLOT) (n = 18) or hemilaminectomy (n = 143).

These complications appeared to be related to the lesion site, the degree of clinical signs and the type of surgical procedure. In our study we found a higher incidence of seizures after cranial myelography, higher incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) complications particularly in paraplegic dogs, and a higher risk of death in patients after the SLOT surgery. The occurrence of cystitis was not significant ( p = 0.5524, p = 0.1655, respectively). We consider seizures, GI ulcerations, and death the most frequent complications after intervertebral disc surgery. Their incidence depends on the lesion site and the degree of neurologic symptoms.",

We monitored the slaughtering skills by measuring the deviation of the location of the stunning shot hole on the skull from the ideal point and further by measuring the angle of inclination of the stunning shot on the skull from the ideal perpendicular angle. We observed the impact of different slaughter skills on the quality of stunning of animals based on the occurrence of failure to achieve motor paralysis after a stun shot. The failure to collapse occurred significantly more frequently ( P &lt; 0.05) in abattoir A than in abattoir B. In both abattoirs there was a higher ( P &lt; 0.05) number of bulls failing to collapse than in females (cows and heifers). However, the effect of slaughter skills on the occurrence of signs associated with insufficient stunning was not found. The signs occurred in abattoir A and abattoir B to the same extent. In bulls, the number of animals with signs was higher ( P &lt; 0.05) than in females in both abattoirs. The results show that insufficient proficiency of skills in stunning cattle with a captive bolt leads to a higher number of animals failing to collapse after a stun shot. The effect of slaughter skills on the occurrence of signs in bulls and females was not proven; however, in bulls a higher incidence of signs was demonstrated than in females.",

Enterotoxins of E. coli induce the release of fluid into the intestines without apparent inflammation. Some serotypes of E. coli , especially O149:F4 can often be identified in association with haemorrhagic gastroenteritis. In this study we infected the weaned piglets (n = 53) by oral administration of enterotoxigenic E. coli O149:F4 strains isolated from piglets suffering from haemorrhagic gastroenteritis. The clinical course of infection and shedding of the challenge E. coli strain in the faeces of infected piglets was monitored for 14 days. The challenge strain soon outnumbered the other E. coli types in the intestines of most piglets. Diarrhoea developed in the majority of piglets and its severity varied. Severe diarrhoea was observed in 10% of the piglets but only one piglet died due to dehydration. No inflammatory lesions were detected in the intestines of the dead piglet and the other euthanized piglets. We assume that development of haemorrhagic gastroenteritis depends on the involvement of other factors that need to be identified. E. coli O149:F4 are only one of the causative factors of haemorrhagic gastroenteritis in piglets after weaning.",

An ultrasound scanner equipped with a 5-MHz convex transducer was used for transvaginal ultrasound-guided follicular aspiration. A 17-gauge, 60-cm aspiration needle was connected with a shortened aspiration line. The fluid was aspirated manually into a 2 ml plastic syringe at a speed of approximately 0.2 ml/s. The success of aspiration was higher in ovarian cysts (100%) and single follicles larger than 13 mm (76.7%) compared to single follicles smaller than 12 mm (20%, p &lt; 0.001). The success of aspiration of multiple follicles on day 4 (diameter of 7–9 mm) was higher (90.9%) compared to follicles on day 2 (diameter of 4-6 mm) (66.7%, p &lt; 0.05) in experiment 1. The fluid from ovarian cysts &gt; 25 mm in diameter was aspirated in a two-step procedure (samples 1 and 2) for the determination of pH, HCO 3 , BE, pCO 2 and pO 2 (experiment 2). The indicators were compared between samples 1 and 2. Higher pO 2 as well as pH and lower pCO 2 in sample 1 compared to sample 2 showed insufficient anaerobic conditions during the first phase of the puncture in experiment 2. Our study brings for the first time the finding that the ovum pick-up equipment used in our experiments is suitable for the collection of follicular fluid only from larger follicular structures. The sampling of follicular fluid for acid-base balance assays requires the development of a special new device to prevent samples from coming into contact with air during aspiration.",

After surgical treatment, the animals were divided based on histological findings into groups and subgroups according to the WHO system. In the individual groups and subgroups the length of their survival following a mammary tumour surgery and death causes were followed. Of their total number, 164 tumours were malignant, 39 were benign and 18 were mammary hyperplasias. With regard to malignant tumours, invasive tubular carcinoma (20.81%) was identified most frequently; fibroadenoma reached the highest occurrence (10.41%) as regards benign tumours. The length of survival in females with malignant tumours ranged from 12 to 37.4 months, depending on histological subtypes. In females with benign mammary neoplasms the length of survival ranged from 39.1 to 59.3 months and in animals with hyperplasia it was 50.2 months. As a result of mammary tumour, 41 females (25%) died in the malignant tumour group, none died in the benign tumour group and 2 females (11.1%) died in the hyperplasia group. The survival periods in surgically treated patients with mammary tumours were shorter for solid and complex carcinomas, compared to patients affected with the remainder of the histological subtypes. The longest survival period following operation was recorded in the group suffering from adenoma. The least favourable illness prognosis for patients with mammary tumours in respect to linking the death cause to the mammary tumour was for those having invasive papillary carcinoma. The most favourable illness prognosis was for patients with benign tumours and non-invasive tubular carcinoma. A frequent death cause in females with mammary tumours was another illness unrelated to mammary tumours.",

It is an important cause of exercise intolerance and results from strenuous exercise and pathophysiological changes in the equine lung and possibly in the airways. Endoscopic surveys of the respiratory tracts of horses after competitive events have shown that many horses experience exercise-induced pulmonary haemorrhage. The reported incidence of exercise-induced pulmonary haemorrhage in different breeds varies between 40–85%. The cause of bleeding in exercising horses has fostered considerable debate over the past three centuries, but currently, the most accepted hypothesis is that the source of haemorrhage is disruption of the pulmonary capillaries during exercise. Furosemide is the medication used most widely for the treatment and prevention of exercise-induced pulmonary haemorrhage. This review provides an update on the aetiology, clinical signs, physiopathology, diagnosis and treatment of exercise-induced pulmonary haemorrhage.",

For fibres with myofibrillar ATPase activity, the intensively growing animals produced higher standard deviation values than the other groups. Further analysis of the muscular tissue in this group revealed that out of the 24 muscles, 9 had giant fibres. In comparison with the less intensively growing animals, the muscles of the bulls that gained more than 900 g/day in weight were found to contain significantly less glycogen ( P ≤ 0.01) and, consequently, the meat was less acidic. The difference of the pH ranged from 0.19 in the case of pH 24 ( P ≤ 0.01) to 0.06 for pH 48 ( P ≤ 0.01). It should be noted that the intensively growing animals were found to have a relatively high pH variability (SD = 0.69 and 0.49, respectively). The pH 24 and pH 48 values, as well as pH variability show that the meat of this group was dark, firm and dry.",

    "abstract": "The study focuses on rapid determination of free amino acids produced during the ripening of cheese, by using near infrared spectroscopy. Analyses of 96 samples of Edam cheese (30% and 45% of fat in dry matter) were performed at monthly intervals up to the ripening age of 6 months. In total, 19 amino acids were analysed with infrared spectrometer using two different methods, either in the regime of reflectance in the integrating sphere of the apparatus or using a fibre optic apparatus with the fibre optic probe. Reference data based on high-performance liquid chromatography were used for calibration of the spectrophotometer. Calibration models were developed using a partial least square algorithm and tested by means of cross-validation. When measured with the integrating sphere and with the probe, the values of correlation coefficients ranged from 0.835 to 0.993 and from 0.739 to 0.995, respectively. Paired t -test did not show significant differences between the reference and predicted values ( P &lt; 0.05). The results of this new calibration method showed the possibility of near infrared technology for fast determination of free amino acids, which occur during the ripening of Edam cheese. The content of free amino acids allow us to prepare Edam cheese quickly and efficiently for sale or to prepare the material for processed cheese.",

Ten experimental Isa Brown layers (36 week of age) were fed melamine-contaminated feed containing 100 mg of melamine per kg of feed. The duration of the experiment was 6 weeks. Eggs were collected during whole experiment. Analysis of eggs was done by a simple extraction of melamine and cyanuric acid residues, using a water-acetonitrile mixture and analysed by gas chromatography - triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. Melamine and cyanuric acid residues were detected in all eggs collected from the experimental layers, immediately after the first administration of melamine-contaminated feed. The mean concentrations of melamine in the egg yolk and egg white recalculated on a dry matter basis were 1.90 mg·kg -1 ± 0.158 and 10.84 mg·kg -1 ± 3.951 ( P ≤ 0.01); the cyanuric acid contents were 6.54 mg·kg -1 ± 0.2.466 and 4.07 mg·kg -1 ± 0.909, respectively. Melamine and cyanuric acid were not detected in eggs from control layers. Concentrations of melamine and cyanuric acid in eggs decreased quickly after melamine feeding was stopped. Our results indicate that melamine undergoes biotransformation to cyanuric acid in the layer’s body that also passed into the eggs. The results verified the presence of distribution metabolic pathway of melamine and its easiest transfer into egg yolk. Moreover, the biotransformation of melamine into cyanuric acid in eggs of layers was confirmed.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare markers of semen quality, sperm membrane damage, and the seminal plasma antioxidant activity in warmblood stallions with and without sport workload stress. Four stallions were used for breeding only (control) and four both for breeding and competition in jumping. Semen samples were collected at 14-day intervals (from June to August) from each stallion (5 ejaculates per stallion). Immediately after sperm collection, a conventional examination of the ejaculate was processed. Catalytic activities of enzymes aspartate aminotransferase, alanin aminotransferase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and indicator of lipoperoxidation - F 2α isoprostanes were measured in samples of seminal plasma. Contrary to basic semen quality indicators, the values of seminal plasma pH, aspartate aminotransferase and alanin aminotransferase were significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) impaired in the physically stressed stallions. Also, the level of F 2α isoprostanes and the activity of superoxide dismutase were significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) increased by stress. The antioxidant activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathion peroxidase increased during the monitored period and reflected changes in F 2α isoprostane concentration. We can conclude that even the conventional basic sperm indicators stay within the reference ranges of the biochemical indicators of seminal plasma such as pH or AST/ALT activity may be negatively influenced by sport workload stress. Increased concentrations of F2α isoprostanes indicate that lipoperoxidation can be a mechanism of cell membrane destabilization, which is counteracted by an increase of antioxidant enzyme activities. This is the first report of oxidative stress symptoms in normospermic equine semen in relation to stallion sport workload.",

We also assessed the impact of environmental factors on heavy metal accumulation in these three components of littoral ecosystem. Cadmium and lead values were significantly higher in bottom sediments (median values 0.70 and 13.4 mg·kg -1 ) than in reed (0.014 and 0.51 mg·kg -1 ) and snails (0.074 and 0.81 mg·kg -1 ). Cadmium values in reed stems positively correlated with Cd values in great pond snails (Spearman’s rank correlation, r S = 0.62; p &lt; 0.05). Cadmium and lead contents in reed stems positively correlated with each other (r S = 0.56; p &lt; 0.05). The mercury values in snails (0.043 mg·kg -1 ) were higher than in sediments (0.040 mg·kg -1 ) and these were higher than in reed stems (0.010 mg·kg -1 ). We also found higher mercury contents in reed stems and higher cadmium contents in great pond snails in eastern compared to western parts of investigated ponds. Based on the principal component analysis (PCA) performed on heavy metal values, relative reed beds rate in the pond perimeter was negatively correlated with the sample scores on the first PCA axis and the orientation of sampling site and fish stock density negatively correlated with the second PCA axis. Our results proved the important role of littoral sediments in Cd, Pb and Hg accumulation, and the suitability of great pond snails for mercury stress biomonitoring in fishponds. In conclusion, littoral reed beds play a very important role in toxic element uptake in fishponds. The results contribute to the understanding of heavy metal cycles and their accumulation in fishponds under semi-natural conditions and in less affected landscape, and can be used as reference values for comparison with more damaged sites.",

Statistically, the experimental solutions did not cause significant changes in pH, acidity and salt content of the samples ( P &lt; 0.05).

Experimental fish were exposed to natural cyanobacterial water blooms (consisting mainly of Microcystis aeruginosa and M. ichthyoblabe ) which contained microcystins (total concentration 1187 - 1211 μg g -1 of dry weight and 17.4 - 25.4 μg l -1 of water) for 28 days without additional feeding. Control groups of fish were kept in another pond without apparent cyanobacterial bloom formation. Experimental and control rearing ponds had the same water source. After exposure, fish were placed in dechlorinated potable water for the same period. Statistical evaluation of the influence of cyanobacterial water bloom on biochemical indices of experimental fish showed a distinct increase of alkaline phosphatase ( p ⪬ 0.05), total bilirubin ( p ⪬ 0.001), creatinine ( p ⪬ 0.01), lactate ( p ⪬ 0.01) and urea ( p ⪬ 0.01) when compared to controls.

Quality of roe deer venison was evaluated based on pH values, colour (CIEL*a*b* system) and chemical composition (content of haem pigments, dry matter, pure protein, collagen and fat). Samples of muscle from the leg (m. gluteus medius) were taken from 22 female roe deer ( Capreolus capreolus L.) from two hunting regions (Liberec and South Moravia) in the Czech Republic. In roe deer from Liberec, higher pH value (5.65, P &lt; 0.001) was found; muscles were darker (L* = 36.03), contained higher redness (a* = 14.41, P &lt; 0.001) and yellowness values (b* = 12.10) and higher chroma (C* = 18.86). In roe deer from South Moravia, higher ( P &lt; 0.05) hue (h°) values, and higher level of haem pigments (2.45 mg·g -1 ) were found. Muscles from roe deer from South Moravia contained higher amounts of dry matter (29.52%, P &lt; 0.001), pure protein (23.84%, P &lt; 0.001) and total collagen (0.86%), and lower amounts of intramuscular fat (0.48%). These results may provide an important source of information for consumers of roe deer meat because several differences in the quality (chemical composition) of muscles from South Moravian region and Liberec region were found. Presumably, the differences between muscles from animals living in two different Czech regions were due to the diet, form of land use (more agricultural land in Southern Moravia, and forests and mountains in Liberec) and climatic conditions (Liberec lies in the northern part of the Czech Republic).

The study was done at 55 client-owned, healthy (n = 34), proteinuric (n = 14), and proteinuric/azotemic (n = 7) dogs. Blood coagulation was assessed by means of standard coagulation profile and thromboelastometry (in-TEM, ex-TEM, and fib-TEM). In proteinuric dogs only the maximum clot firmness and maximum clot elasticity significantly increased ( P &lt; 0.05), whereas in the proteinuric/azotemic dogs the thromboelastometric profiles showed a pronounced increase of blood coagulability, as indicated by significant changes ( P &lt; 0.05) of the variables clotting time, clot formation time, α angle, maximum clot firmness and maximum clot elasticity. After correction for group affiliation, the linear regression analysis showed a non significant association between changes in proteinuria and thromboelastometric profiles. In conclusion, thromboelastometric changes indicating hypercoagulabilty were more consistently found in the dogs with proteinuria/azotemia, than in those with proteinuria alone, suggesting that the former dogs can be considered at higher thrombotic risk.

The aim of this study was to use a newly developed adsorptive stripping voltammetry procedure for determination of acrylamide concentrations in five and three different kinds of dog and cat dry feedstuff, respectively. The applied analytical procedure consists of a solvent extraction in ultrasound bath, followed by voltammetric measurement at the hanging mercury drop electrode in ammonia buffer. The accuracy of the method was verified by use of standard reference materials. The range of acrylamide concentration found in samples of dry dog and cat feedstuff ranged from 106 to 358 μg/kg, and from 66 to 269 μg/kg, respectively. The precision of analyses expressed in form of the relative standard deviations ranged between 0.6–1.7%. The voltammetric procedure appears to be a reliable, sensitive, rapid and low-cost analytical technique for the determination of acrylamide in food and feedstuff. The concentrations of acrylamide found in feedstuff were relatively moderate but it is undoubtedly necessary to monitor its concentrations in future.",

    "abstract": "Time course changes in selected biochemical stress indices (corticosterone, triglycerides, glucose, cholesterol) following short-term noise exposure at 100 dB for 28 min were studied in broilers aged 42 days. Corticosterone concentrations were found to increase during the first 10 min of noise exposure and to differ significantly from the control (background sound – 50 dB) at Time 10 min and 14 min, then decreased continually and at 28 min returned to the initial prestress value. Triglyceride concentrations increased in broilers exposed to 100 dB noise during the first 12 min with a significant difference from the control at 12 min and 14 min. Glucose concentrations were higher due to 100 dB noise exposure for almost the entire period monitored, with significant differences between 100 dB and control broilers at 6 min and from 10 min to 14 min. Similarly as for the corticosterone concentration, a drop in triglycerides and glucose concentrations was seen approximately from Time 14 min and a return to the pre-stress value at 28 min. The cholesterol concentrations showed various temporal patterns with no significant difference between 100 dB and control broilers in this experiment. The pattern of response found in the study indicates that 100 dB noise represents a stress factor in broilers, however, there is the ability of broilers to adapt to an increased level of noise at this intensity after the first 14 min of exposure. The findings obtained in the study may contribute to expanding detailed knowledge of physiological stress responses to this specific noise stimulus in poultry, and could thereby be used to improve the welfare of broilers in intensive housing systems.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate if the modified Insall Salvati (IS) method can be applied for the canine patient despite differences of proximal tibial morphology, and if such potential differences are also seen in dogs with cranial cruciate ligament rupture. Insall Salvati method is a simple and convenient method for determination of the vertical position of patella, by dividing the length of patella by length of the patellar ligament. The influence of the variable proximal tibial morphology on the modified (IS) index was measured and the value of modified IS index in healthy dogs (n = 25) was compared with dogs with cranial cruciate ligament rupture (n = 26). Medio-lateral radiographs of 102 stifles were evaluated. Patellar ligament length (PLL), patellar length (PL), modified IS ratio and the height of insertion point of patellar ligament on tibial tuberosity were measured. Data of the IS ratio were compared with the value of the height of the insertion point with no significant difference ( P = 0.36). There was no significant difference ( P = 0.07) in the PLL:PL ratio between dogs affected or unaffected with cranial cruciate ligament rupture. Based on the results of this study we can conclude that the morphology of the cranio-proximal tibia and the height of insertion point of the patellar ligament do not have an influence on the value of the modified IS index both in healthy dogs and in dogs with cranial cruciate ligament rupture.",

A larvoscopic examination of the faeces and helminthological necropsies, pathoanatomical and histological examinations of the lungs were performed. The overall prevalence of protostrongylids was 70% (77/110), and the prevalence of Elaphostrongylus cervi and Varestrongylus sagittatus was 68% (75/110), and 27% (30/110), respectively. In 25% (28/110) of the faecal samples, mixed infection with V. sagittatus and E. cervi was found. Mixed protostrongylid infections with those two species were detected in lungs of all animals. The macroscopic lesions found in the lungs parasitized by those helminths were classified as follows: gray, dark-red to black stained portions on the lungs surface varying in shape and size; brown-black nodes clearly differentiated from the surrounding tissue; small, hard subserous nodules. The most frequently observed microscopic abnormalities were desquamatous bronchitis, alveolitis associated with accumulations of alveolar macrophages and eosinophilic granulocytes, haemorrhages in the alveoli and the alveolar septa, development of parasitic granulomas in the interstitium as well as a peribronchial, perilobular, disseminated and intralobular hyperplasia of the lymphoid tissue. The macroscopic and microscopic alterations depended on the species of the parasites found in the inflammatory areas. The infections with E. cervi were most often associated with the lesions on the lungs surface varying in color, shape and size and with the small, hard subserous nodules, and those with V. sagittatus – with the brown-black nodes clearly differentiated from the surrounding tissue .",

Plant leaves control the AFTs (AFB1 and AFB2) efficiently without compromising the feed quality. Punica granatum leaves (5%) completely inhibited the AFTs in the stored feed over the period of six months. Ziziphus jujube Mill., P. guajava , F. benghalensis , and G. radicans also showed promising anti-aflatoxigenic activities.

The samples were collected from 77 animals – 23 llamas ( Llama guanicoe f. gllama ) and 54 alpacas ( Llama guanicoe f. pacos ) during a spring health check. The concentrations of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and manganese (Mn) were determined by Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry and selenium (Se) by Hydride Generation Atomic Absorption Spectrometry. We found the following concentrations (mean ± standard deviation; mg/kg dry matter) in the llama hair: Cu 9.70 ± 4.69; Zn 145.20 ± 21.07; Mn 12.49 ± 10.14; Se 0.25 ± 0.14. In alpaca hair we found the following concentrations: Cu 10.22 ± 2.90; Zn 129.81 ± 19.01; Mn 12.67 ± 13.85; Se 0.48 ± 0.24. We found a significant difference between llamas and alpacas in Zn and Se concentrations in the hair. From all the evaluated factors we found that coat colour had the highest effect on Mn and Se concentration. Dark haired animals had significantly higher concentrations of these trace elements than other coloured groups. The evaluation of the concentration of trace elements in the hair of llamas has a potential to be used for the evaluation of long-term status of trace elements in the body; however, it is necessary to continue with experimental work in this area. Our findings can serve as a pilot study for further works in this field.",

A total of 180 Cherry Valley ducks were divided into three groups (E1, E2, and control). The control group was fed a diet containing soybean meal. Soybean meal replaced with 50% and 100% meal of white lupin seeds were used in group E1 and group E2, respectively. At the end of the fattening, 12 ducks (6 males and 6 females) were randomly selected from each group for a haematological examination. From the result of this study, it is clear that the effect of the diet was found only on the slightly varying number of white blood cells and on the proportion of monocytes. Ducks of group E2 showed a slight increase in the total number of leukocytes which was accompanied by a decrease in the percentage share of monocytes ( P &lt; 0.05). Based on the results, it can be claimed that the replacement of soybean meal with meal from the Zulika variety of whole white lupin seeds in the diet did not have a negative effect on the determined blood indicators. Therefore, whole white lupin seeds were successfully used as the important protein component of the diet for fattening hybrid mallard ducks.",

    "abstract": "Quaternary benzophenanthridine alkaloids are known to have a wide range of biological effects, including antimicrobial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, and antitumour activities. However, only sanguinarine and chelerythrine have been studied intensively. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory potential of the five minor quaternary benzophenanthridine alkaloids sanguilutine, sanguirubine, chelirubine, chelilutine, and macarpine in vitro and to compare them with more thoroughly studied sanguinarine and chelerythrine. Before making cell-based assays, the cytotoxicity of the alkaloids was evaluated. The anti-inflammatory potential of the chosen alkaloids was evaluated as for their ability to modulate the lipopolysaccharide-induced secretion of tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in the macrophage-like cell line THP-1. The cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 inhibitory activities were also measured. The results indicate that the presence of a methylenedioxy ring attached at carbon (C)7-C8 is important for reducing the secretion of TNF-α. Interestingly, this effect did not show a simple dependence on concentration. The selected alkaloids showed little or no anti-COX activity. The results obtained from the present experiments may provide additional information useful in understanding the structure-to-activity relationship of the quaternary benzophenanthridine alkaloids. The anti-inflammatory potential and the cytotoxic effect are driven by the presence of a methylenedioxy ring attached at C7-C8 and C2-C3, respectively.",

Three non-lactating cows fitted with rumen cannulas were used to determine the effect of in situ rumen degradation on crude protein and amino acid profile of rumen-undegraded protein of feedstuffs. The obtained values of rumen degradability of crude protein with significant difference ( P &lt; 0.001) between feeds ranged from 20.3 to 76.3% (mean 62.0 ± 17.9%) and values of total amino acids ranged from 30.9% in corn gluten meal to 83.8% in corn gluten feed (mean 67.5 ± 16.4%). An in vitro modified 3-step method was used to determine intestinal digestibility. Intestinal digestibility of undegraded protein varied from 54.5 ± 1.4% in raw soybean to 95.2 ± 1.0% in corn gluten feed. The absorbable amino acid profile of rumen-undegraded protein for each feedstuff was compared with profiles of the original feedstuff and the rumen-exposed undegraded protein. Absorbable lysine (9.3 ± 1.1 g/kg of crude protein) was higher in products of soybean and sunflower cake. Corn gluten feed and meal supplied more absorbable methionine (3.6 ± 0.6 g/kg of crude protein). This study showed that the digestibility factor of crude protein and amino acid based on in situ and in vitro methods for thermal treatment of protein feeds can be used in models to optimize the amino acid nutrition of dairy cows and expand knowledge about rumen degradability and ileal digestibility of amino acids in feedstuffs.",

Moreover, after 24 h exposure of cells to cadmium, colorimetric 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-difenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) test was used to measure the metabolic activity and cytotoxicity was determined by measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leaked from damaged cells.

With increasing concentration of cadmium (15–50 mg·l -1 ) significantly lower proliferative ( P &lt; 0.05) and metabolic activity ( P &lt; 0.05) of cells was observed and cytotoxicity increased simultaneously ( P &lt; 0.001). In addition, we found that the real-time monitoring of the cell response was significantly correlated with commonly used biological methods for toxicity measurement, for MTT assay R 2 was 0.9448 ( P &lt; 0.01) and for LDH assay R 2 was 0.9466 ( P &lt; 0.01), respectively. The present study is the first report when combination of RTCA, MTT assay and LDH test was used for cadmium nephrotoxicity assessment. In all these methods, the toxic effect of cadmium on rabbit kidney cells increased in a concentration-dependent manner.",

The FS-1 is an ion nanostructured complex formed by proteins and/or polypeptides, carbohydrates, salts of alkali and alkaline earth metals with intercalated iodine. Patented in 2014, it is intended for the treatment of infectious diseases of bacterial origin including nosocomial infections and multidrug resistant tuberculosis. The aim of the study was to determine its acute and subchronic toxicity. The study of acute and subchronic toxicity was performed on adult Wistar rats according to OECD guidelines. The data on acute toxicity showed LD 50 &gt; 2,000 mg/kg after a single intragastric administration. Twenty-eight days of FS-1 administration at a dose of 500 mg/kg resulted in toxic effects. At a dose of 250 mg/kg, the toxic effects were temporary and a return to normal followed after the recovery period. Doses of 100 mg/kg had no adverse effects on the rats.",

    "abstract": "Tissue fixation is an essential step in the performance of ancillary studies, including immunohistochemistry. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of various fixatives and fixative times on immunohistochemistry (IHC) in bovine and porcine endometrium using progesterone receptors and SOX2 antibodies. Immunohistochemical staining with progesterone receptors and SOX2 was performed on tissue samples fixed in formalin, Antigenfix, Greenfix, Bouin’s solution and methacarn at 1.5, 8.5, 15.5, 29.5, 64.5, 189.5, 249.5, 309.5 and 369.5 days of fixation. Formalin and Antigenfix proved to be the best fixative for both short-term and long-term fixation for IHC. Bouin’s solution was partially applicable for short-term (24 h) fixation. Greenfix and methacarn were absolutely inappropriate fixatives for IHC (completely negative staining using methacarn). These results were obtained on an automated immunostainer using EDTA buffer pH 8.4 as the antigen retrieval solution. When the staining procedure was performed manually and citrate buffer with different pH values was used, weakly positive results were obtained with both progesterone receptors (pH 8 and 9) and SOX2 (pH 7.2); however, significantly lower staining quality was obtained using the methacarn fixative compared to aldehyde fixatives. The reported findings demonstrated the superiority of aldehyde fixatives (formalin and Antigenfix) over alcohol fixatives (methacarn) and fixatives combining both denaturing and cross-linking proteins (Greenfix and Bouin’s solution) for IHC. Antigen retrieval-IHC using EDTA buffer was found to be excellent for aldehyde fixatives, but proved to be completely unsuitable for methacarn, Greenfix, and Bouin’s solution.",

Antimicrobial characteristics were tested using the disk diffusion method and plate count method, and cytotoxicity was evaluated by the MTT assay. Fish oil (y) was released from PLGA NPs within the time interval (x) of 96 h according to equation y = 6.2 + 0.914x. PLGA-FO NPs did not affect growth of Staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains. No cytotoxic effect of the tested NPs on the keratinocyte cell line was observed for concentration of 1 µg/ml. PLGA-FO NPs represent an interesting alternative for wound healing due to an excellent biocompatibility and unique release profile of FO, despite their lack of antimicrobial efficiency.",

A total of 120 seven-day-old Japanese quails ( Coturnix coturnix Japonica ) were randomly divided into four groups, with each group containing five replicates, six birds each. SB was mixed with the diet at four concentrations (0, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0%). Performance indicators were determined for an experimental period of six weeks. At the end of the experiment, 2 quails from each replicate were slaughtered and carcass traits were measured. The blood serum biochemical values, antioxidant status, and meat quality indicators were determined from blood and breast meat samples. The results showed that SB supplementation significantly improved the feed conversion ratio (FCR) in the 2–7 week period, the relative weight of the proventriculus, glucose and total cholesterol (TC) and a* (redness) colour traits in meat. Moreover, the total oxidant status (TOS) in blood serum and malondialdehyde (MDA) values were decreased with SB addition to Japanese quails’ diet. Hence, dietary SB supplementation could be used to improve the performance and antioxidant status in Japanese quails.",

The results showed that the incidence of kidney damage was lower in all monitored species ( P &lt; 0.05) in fattened animals compared to adult ones. In cattle and pigs, the incidence of kidney damage was lower ( P &lt; 0.01) in fattened animals (bulls, finisher pigs) than in culled young (calves, piglets). When comparing individual categories of adult animals, the lowest incidence of kidney damage was found in does and ewes (2.68% and 3.01%, respectively), then in sows (28.45%), and the highest was in cows (40.46%). Among fattened animals, the incidence of findings in kidneys was increasing in the order of kids (0.21%), lambs (0.42%), bulls (10.46%) and finisher pigs (14.42%). Findings of chronic kidney damage were more frequent than findings of acute ( P &lt; 0.01) and parasitic ( P &lt; 0.01) origin in all observed categories of animals. The results show that, from the point of view of the incidence of kidney damage as a major consequence of imbalance between the organism’s metabolic needs and the nutrition provided to the animals, there are deficiencies of a significant level, which prove that there is still significant room for further optimization of the nutrition of individual categories of animals, that would take into account not only performance, overall clinical health, but also subclinical animal health, leading to a reduction in the incidence of kidney damage detected in animals at slaughter.",

A total of 204 samples from various pathological lesions were examined, while 153 cases (75.00%) were true tumours and 51 cases (25.00%) were pseudotumorous non-neoplastic lesions. The distribution of the incidence of true neoplasms in relation to sex was uneven. In the examined group, more neoplasms were diagnosed in males (n = 88, 57.52%) compared to females (n = 65, 42.48%). The mean age of guinea pigs with diagnosed tumour in our group was 4.2 years. Thyroid adenocarcinoma was the most frequent tumour. The majority of thyroid tumours (67.86%) were diagnosed in animals aged 4–5 years, as a significant result in terms of incidence in this age range, as well as a predisposition to tumour formation in males (78.57%). Mammary gland tumours occurred in the age range of 2–7 years, with a mean age of incidence of 4.7 years. In all cases, these were malignant variants and showing a significant higher incidence in males, in the age range of 4–5 years. The processing of a representative number of samples and epidemiological data on the incidence of spontaneous tumours in guinea pigs can contribute to the overall expansion of knowledge about this topic in veterinary medicine.",

    "abstract": "The effect of selected isolation methods on the viability of neutrophil granulocytes (neutrophils) from the blood of healthy Holstein x Bohemian Red Pied crossbred heifers was evaluated. Two methods of neutrophil isolation were used: a) neutrophil isolation on the basis of hypotonic erythrocyte lysis (in two variants: after the erythrocyte lysis proper, the cells were centrifuged at either 200 g or 1000 g ), and b) neutrophil isolation with FACS Lysing Solution as the lysing agent. The viability of the isolated neutrophils was evaluated on the basis of apoptosis and necrosis. The results obtained with flow cytometry (FCM) suggest that, from the isolation techniques used, the method based on FACS Lysing Solution impaired the neutrophil viability least. After the application of this method, 5.36 ± 2.15% of neutrophils were apoptotic and 0.51 ± 0.12% were necrotic. In contrast, when the hypotonic erythrocyte lysis was used, the proportion of apoptotic neutrophils amounted to 42.14 ± 7.12% and 49.00 ± 14.70%, respectively, and 41.12 ± 5.55% and 36.91 ± 24.38% respectively of necrotic neutrophils ( P &lt; 0.01). This was also confirmed by the light microscopy. After the isolation with FASC Lysing Solution, 1.92 ± 1.74% of neutrophils were apoptotic and 1.05 ± 0.76% were necrotic, as distinct from after the hypotonic erythrocyte lysis where 9.43 ± 3.69% of neutrophils were apoptotic and 12.67 ± 4.74% of necrotic after centrifugation at 200 g , while 12.60 ± 4.35 were apoptotic and 14.96 ± 12.64% were necrotic after centrifugation at 1000 g . It follows from the above-mentioned data that hypotonic lysis is not a suitable method for the isolation of neutrophils, as the method itself markedly affects cell viability.",

The most interesting data concerned the number, course, drainage and structural peculiarities of the pancreatic duct. The structural and ultrastructural features of the two cell types lining the pancreatic duct (main cells and globose cells) were suggestive of their role in secretion and resorption of the pancreatic juice. The results allow the understanding of the particular digestive process of this species.",

After 3 weeks of storage the initial content of 41.97 mmol·kg -1 of fat rose to as much as 1,617.22 mmol·kg -1 of fat. The extent of the change depended mainly on the Bacillus spp. species and the storage period and, to a certain degree, also on the initial number of microorganisms. Significant lipolytic activity was detected in association with B. licheniformis and B. cereus species. It was found that spores of resistant B. licheniformis strains may survive 100 °C/10 min and 135 °C/5 s heating and show lipolytic activity.",

Twenty Black Sicilian pigs (10 males, 10 females) from a farm in Sicily (Italy) were slaughtered at two years of age. Muscle tissues were obtained from three muscles: psoas major, longissimus dorsi, and trapezius. Myofibres were stained for myosin ATPase, succinic dehydrogenase, and α-amylase-PAS. For all fibre types, area and perimeter were measured. Slow-twitch oxidative fibres, fast-twitch glycolytic fibres and fast-twitch oxidative-glycolytic fibres were histochemically differentiated; an image-analyzing system was used. The results showed no differences between males and females in percentage of the fibre types, but there were significant differences between sexes in size of all the three fibre types. Psoas major muscle had a high percentage of slow-twitch oxidative fibres and contained more capillaries per fibre and per mm 2 than trapezius and longissimus dorsi, in which fast-twitch glycolytic fibres dominated. The cross-sectional area of all fibres types was larger in longissimus dorsi than in trapezius and psoas major muscles; the giant fibres were absent in all the muscles studied. Fibre type composition may contribute to the variation of meat quality.",

Embryos obtained on day 4 of pregnancy were stained by morphological triple staining (Hoechst 33342, propidium iodide, Calcein AM), and the number of nuclei, blastocyst formation, distribution of embryos according to the nucleus number and cell death incidence were determined. Embryos in the experimental groups (except for the lowest dose 118 mg/kg b.m.) showed a highly significant dose-dependent reduction in total cell numbers corresponding to the lower proportion of blastocysts. The occurrence of cell death was significantly increased in all experimental groups, indicating that Euparen Multi is able to cause cell death at relatively low doses. Our data demonstrate that Euparen Multi could induce significant alterations in the preimplantation embryo development.",

The pigs did not show any signs of clinical respiratory tract disorders at the time of slaughter. Organ samples were used for isolation, and specific antibodies in 384 sera samples (of which 368 belonged to animals used in organ sampling) were investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). For isolation, the lung and tonsil samples were inoculated onto PPLO agar plates with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), and A. pleuropneumoniae (serotype 12) was isolated from only one of the tonsil samples. Of the 384 blood samples, 258 (67.2%) were found to be positive. 209 (54.4%) of the positive samples were determined to be group 1, and 49 (12.8%) were determined to be group 2. The effect of age and sex of the samples were found to be non-significant by statistical analysis of the ELISA data ( p &gt; 0.05). Isolation of A. pleuropneumoniae indicates the presence of the infection in Turkey for the first time and high seroprevalence supports this finding.",

The experimental period was composed of four phases of 28 days of age, being evaluated from 40 to 56 weeks of age of the birds.

Excluding the effect of lineages, the treatments were done with six relations: Arg: Lys, as the following arrangement: T1 = Relation= 0.91 or 0.64% Arg (-10%) and 0.71% of Lys digestible (level Normal); T2 = Relation 1.01 or 0.72% of Arg and 0.71% Lys digestible, normal levels or control; T3 = Relation 1.11 or 0.79% Arg (+10%) and 0.71% Lys digestible (normal level), T4 = Relation 0.82, or 0.64% Arg (-10%) and 0.78% Lys digestible (+10% of normal); T5 = Relation 0.92 or 0.72% Arg (normal) and 0.78% Lys digestible (+10% of normal); T6 = Relation 1.01 or 0.79% Arg (+10%) and 0.78% Lys digestible (+10% of normal).

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to test and verify the characteristics of a new type of carbon-coated ARTECOR® vascular prosthesis developed at the Knitting Research Institute, a.s. Brno. Eight healthy Merino sheep, aged between 2 and 3 years, were implanted four types (A, B, C with diamond-like carbon (DLC) coating and D as a control without DLC) of vascular prostheses. The site of implantation was the common carotid artery; the length of the implant was 7 cm. All sheep received antibiotics prophylactically in accordance with the theory of the so-called “protected coagulum”. Doppler ultrasound examination was performed before finishing the operation to verify the patency of each prosthesis. During the study period the animals were closely observed. Prostheses were extirpated on day +/- 100 in 6 sheep and on day 182 in 2 sheep. Type B prosthesis showed better results according to its postoperative patency. The implant lumen was constantly 7 mm, whereas the use of other types resulted in lumen narrowing. Type B prosthesis has a deposition of DLC coating of a thickness of 20 nm with a high content of sp3 bonds (more diamond-like ones). The experimental type B of prosthesis ARTECOR® appears to be the most successful of the tested prostheses (at the end of the study all B-type prostheses remained patent). This prosthesis appears to better satisfy the rheologic characteristics for healing.",

Inhalation anaesthesia was administered by mask (5% isoflurane with oxygen, 1.0 l/min), once reactions to external stimuli had decreased (15.45 ± 1.54 min later). Tracheal intubation was performed as soon as the iguanas exhibited complete tolerance to mechanical stimuli. A second study was performed 4 weeks later using the same green iguanas with no pre-medication. Marked individual reactions to masking were observed during both experiments. Some iguanas exhibited breath holding which prolonged anaesthetic induction. Physical stimulation was used in these cases in order to stimulate spontaneous breathing. The mean anaesthetic induction time was similar in both groups of green iguanas (4.34 ± 0.47 and 4.93 ± 0.88 min). There was also a comparable interval from masking to safe tracheal intubation in both experimental groups (15.21 ± 4.26 and 14.31 ± 1.39 min). In view of the results, pre-medication with butorphanol cannot be considered an effective method of anaesthetic induction in green iguanas.",

These include polychlorinated biphenyls, hexachlorobenzene and octachlorostyrene measured in chub muscle and polyaromatic hydrocarbons measured in bear Vodňany. The levels of selected biomarkers should correlate with the concentration of cheottom sediments obtained from the same locations. The highest EROD activity (median 101.37 pmol min -1 mg -1 protein), GST activity (median 42.82 nmol min -1 mg -1 protein), and GSH concentration (median 8.01 nmol mg -1 protein) were found in fish liver from the Podbaba location. There were no significant differences in CYP P450 level or EROD activity among the different locations. In Podbaba, GST activity ( P &lt; 0.01) and GSH concentrations ( P &lt; 0.001) were significantly higher than in the control location. The results of these analyses were correlated and a significant correlation was found between biochemical markers and their inducers. The results show that the use of biochemical markers in water quality assessment is a convenient method that can supplement classical chemical monitoring.",

The data were analyzed to acquire reference values in 55 normal dogs and to estimate the degree of hearing impairment associated with the disease. Fifty-four dogs with COEM were divided into two degrees of severity. The first one included dogs with severe (n = 16), and the second with moderate COEM (n = 38). The recognisability wave V was found higher than the others at every stimulation level. Wave VII was not seen by the bone-conducted click at all stimulation levels, and also in cases with severe COEM by the air-conducted click. Recognisability of wave V was seen more than 50% at 60 dBHL in severe COEM. This ratio was seen at 30 dBHL in moderate COEM. In healthy dogs, the latencies of waves (I–VII) were compared between the left and the right side, and there were no significant differences between each side except for a shorter latency of wave VI. In conclusion, COEM caused increasing latency rather than total deafness, and BAEP can be suggested as an ancillary diagnostic tool in ear disorders.",

The aim of this work was to determine estrogenic compound levels in the rivers in the Brno area. The concentration of 17β-estradiol, ethynylestradiol, estrone and diethylstilbestrol was estimated in the water samples collected in the Svratka and Svitava rivers. Estrogens were isolated from the samples using solid-phase extraction with Oasis HLB cartridges and determined by means of reversed phase HPLC with UV detection. The detection limit of the method used was 6 ng l -1 , repeatability expressed as RSD was 11%, and recovery was 87 - 103%. Estrogen values detected ranged in the interval of 6-209 ng l -1 , depending on the sampling site. After treatment in the sewage water treatment plant, the water displayed markedly lower levels of estrogenic compounds. The results of the experiment demonstrate that HPLC-UV is a suitable method for determination of low concentrations of estrogens in water. The sewage water treatment plant reduces concentrations of estrogens but not sufficiently to prevent their estrogenic effect on fish.",

    "abstract": "Acetaminophen (AAP) overdose causes severe liver injury and is the leading cause of acute liver injury in humans. The mechanisms participating in its toxic effect are glutathione depletion, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) is the principal biological methyl donor and is also a precursor of glutathione. In our previous studies we have documented a protective action of SAMe against various toxic injuries of rat hepatocytes in primary cultures. The aim of this study was to evaluate a possible protective effect of SAMe against AAP-induced toxic injury of primary rat hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were exposed to AAP (2.5 mM) or AAP together with SAMe at the final concentrations of 5, 25 or 50 mg/l for 24 h. Incubation of hepatocytes with AAP caused a significant increase of the leakage of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) ( p &lt; 0.001) and decline of the activity of cellular dehydrogenases (WST- 1) ( p &lt; 0.001). Co-incubation of hepatocytes with SAMe at any dose did not improve these markers of cellular integrity. The functional indicators improved in hepatocytes co-cultured with SAMe - urea production was significantly increased when using the highest dose of SAMe ( p &lt; 0.05); albumin synthesis was higher in all cultured hepatocytes exposed to SAMe ( p &lt; 0.05). SAMe did not influence AAP-induced decrease of cellular content of glutathione. Mitochondrial respiration of harvested digitonin-permeabilized hepatocytes was measured; Complex II was more sensitive to toxic action of AAP, respiration was decreased by 20%. This decrease was completely abolished by SAMe.",

During the trials the live weight was monitored and blood samples were taken on days 310, 403, 448, 479, 512, 554 and 618 of age. The concentrations of total proteins, glucose, total cholesterol, urea and catalytic concentrations of ALP, ALT, AST, calcium, inorganic phosphorus, magnesium and copper in the blood plasma were assessed. In all cases the levels of indicators of the internal environment were within the range of the physiological values for the respective age category. Compared to bulls and steers, the concentration of total plasma cholesterol of the heifers was significantly higher ( p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.01, respectively). The last samples were taken prior to slaughter of the animals and the individual components were correlated with the nutritional values and meat indicators; the correlation between the amount of glucose and urea in the blood serum and the tenderness of the meat was significant ( p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.01). The correlation between the concentration of proteins in the blood plasma, the level of nitrogen or total protein in the muscles, the water-holding capacity and meat tenderness was positive. The study provides a basis for implementing helpful adjustments in current cattle management practises.

    "abstract": "Model experimental studies focused on the intestinal suture techniques in relation to healing, postoperative narrowing of the intestinal lumen or adhesion formation can not comprise a number of clinical factors (foreign body presence in the intestine, haematological abnormalities, septic peritonitis, different age of patients, etc.) that under clinical practice conditions may have an effect on the healing of the intestinal suture. The aim of this clinical study was to confirm in a group of dogs surgically treated for small bowel obstruction, whether different techniques of its wall suture may affect the frequency of possible dehiscence occurrence. This study compares two different techniques of intestinal wall suture in relation to postoperative dehiscence of the intestinal wall closure. Based on the clinical observation with regard to the risk of postoperative dehiscence and possible complications in form of adhesions, also the importance of omentalisation in the suture of small bowel was evaluated. No significant difference was demonstrated ( p &gt; 0.05) in the frequency of postoperative dehiscence at the site of the intestinal wall closure between the two-layer inverting and singlelayer appositional techniques of suture. Likewise, no significant difference was demonstrated ( p &gt; 0.05) in the frequency of dehiscence of intestinal wall suture between patients that underwent intestinal suture omentalisation and those whose intestinal wall suture was not complemented with omentalisation. Based on the results of this clinical study it may be stated that both manual single-layer approximation technique and two-layer inverting technique of the intestinal wall suture are equally safe from the viewpoint of possible dehiscence, and it depends on the surgeon's preference, which one of the said techniques he or she chooses. Concurrently it may be assumed that an exactly performed suture of the intestinal wall does not necessarily require omentalisation.",

In case of ascorbic acid supplementation the highest chemotactic activity was observed at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. The results obtained in microtitration (MTT) assay also suggest that high concentrations of α-tocopherol (0.5 mg/ml) play a role in protecting bovine leukocytes against the cytotoxic effect of Lkt, the susceptibility of the leukocytes on M. haemolytica Lkt was lower in comparison to control about 6%. The antioxidants used in this study have been found to have a protective effect on cells participating in the immune response to M. haemolytica . This particularly applies to high concentrations of α-tocopherol. The clinical aspect of these results may lie in protection of leukocytes exposed to leukotoxin of M. haemolytica . It should be emphasized that the results provide only partial information on the effect of the antioxidants studied on cells participating in an organism’s defence mechanisms.

The tested strains were isolated from piglets aged 7 to 30 days. Bacterial species were identified by standard microbiological techniques and susceptibility to antibiotics was determined quantitatively by the standard microdilution method. Resistance of the Staphylococcus aureus strain to oxacillin was confirmed by detection of the mecA gene and PBP2a. A total of 115 Staphylococcus spp. isolates were collected. In the case of Staphylococcus aureus , the methicillin-resistant strain (MRSA) was identified. Moreover, higher frequency of coagulase-negative staphylococci with minimum inhibitory concentration of oxacillin ≥ 0.5 mg/l was noticed. Inducible resistance to clindamycin in the Staphylococcus hominis strain was also detected. The strains of Enterococcus spp. (61 isolates) exhibited high resistance to tetracycline (98.5%), erythromycin (86.8%) and chloramphenicol (54.4%). Vancomycin-resistant enterococci were not isolated. In the case of Escherichia coli strains (111 isolates), higher frequency of resistant strains to tetracycline (81.1%) and ampicillin (62.2%) was documented. Resistance to fluoroquinolones and production of broad-spectrum β-lactamases was not noticed. The presented study may be considered as a pilot project assessing the prevalence of resistant bacteria in piglets kept on a single farm. It demonstrated the presence of resistant strains of Staphylococcus spp., including one MRSA strain, Enterococcus spp. and Escherichia coli . These strains may be present as a result of postnatal colonization with both bacterial microflora of dams and environmental microflora.",

    "abstract": "The presence of equine herpesviruses 1, 2 and 5 (EHV-1, EHV-2 and EHV-5) was examined in 66 samples of spinal cord, submandibular lymph nodes and spleen of healthy, non-vaccinated abattoir horses from different locations in the Republic of Serbia. Virus isolation was conducted on RK-13 cell line with the confirmation of isolated viral strains by multiplex nested polymerase chain reaction. The cytopathic effect was observed 48–72 h after the first inoculation in 28 (42.4%) organ samples, and after 5 days in 11 other samples (16.7%) that were all confirmed as EHV-1. Four other samples (6.1%) that showed cytopathic effects on day 5 of the third passage were all positive for EHV-5. Additionally, EHV-1, EHV-2, and EHV-5 were directly detected in all organs by multiplex nested PCR in 46 (69.7%), 3 (4.5%), and 7 (10.6%) samples, respectively. The molecular characterization based on nucleotide sequencing of the part of the gB gene showed that Serbian EHV-1 isolates were 100% homogenous and clustered with EHV-1 strains from Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan. The EHV-2 strain from Serbia branched together with Turkish EHV-2 isolates with homogeneity from 96% to 98%. Serbian EHV-5 strains can be separated in one distinct cluster with isolates from Turkey and the United States with homogeneity from 98 to 99%. These data represent the first report of the molecular characterization of EHV-1, EHV-2, and EHV-5 in the horse population of the Republic of Serbia and document the first successful isolation of Serbian EHV-5 strains.",

    "abstract": "The study aimed to determine the occurrence of Enterobacteriaceae producing broad-spectrum beta-lactamases, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains in poultry in Moravia, Czech Republic, including phenotypic and genotypic analyses of the extent of resistance. Using chromogenic screening media, a total of 240 clinical samples collected from poultry and the poultry farm environment were processed. Phenotypic tests identified 23 isolates of broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and one VRE isolate ( Enterococcus faecium with VanA resistance). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains were not detected. Among the isolates producing broad-spectrum beta-lactamases, 17 produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, most frequently CTX-M; the remaining 6 isolates were CIT-type AmpC enzymes. No carbapenemase-producing strains were detected. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed that 21 E. coli strains (91%) were genetically unrelated isolates. Increasing resistance of bacteria to antibiotic agents poses a serious issue for both human and veterinary medicine globally. For humans, a potential source of resistant bacteria may be animals or their products entering the human food chain, for example poultry. The presented study extends existing knowledge about the occurrence of resistant bacteria in poultry in Moravia and describes the phenotype and genotype of their resistance to antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "Previous research has shown that the administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in postpartum cattle has the potential to be a viable way to improve productivity and reproduction, although further research is necessary to optimise recommendations for producers. The aim of this research was to determine the influence of carprofen on dairy cows using a number of different indices including stress, reproduction, and milk yield data. The experiment was carried out on 100 first-lactation dairy cows. The animals were divided into two groups. The treatment group (TG, n = 50) was given a subcutaneous injection of Rimadyl Cattle ® (50 mg/ml of carprofen) up to one hour after calving. At the same time, the control group (CG, n = 50) was given an injection of 0.9% NaCl. Blood tests were taken 2, 24, and 48 h after calving and tested using the fluorescence enzyme immunoassay method for cortisol analysis. At 305 days, the total milk yield was recorded for each cow. A computerised herd management program was used for data registration and analysis. Pregnancy was tested by ultrasound between 30 and 35 days after insemination. A subcutaneous injection of carprofen (1.4 mg per 1 kg of body weight) given one hour after parturition in first-lactation cows reduced the level of cortisol within 48 h after calving. During lactation (305 days in milk), the intervention increased the milk yield (252 kg) and pregnancy rates (8.5%), reduced the calving interval (43 days), and decreased the somatic cell count during the second, third, and fourth months after calving.",

    "abstract": "The present study was carried out in the region of South Gujarat, India, to determine the prevalence and predisposing factors of canine parvovirus-2 (CPV-2) infection in acute gastroenteritis of pups. Further, haemagglutination (HA) test, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and rapid immunochromatography test were compared for diagnosis and prevalent CPV-2 types were ascertained. A total of 73 diarrhoea samples were collected and out of those 32, 33 and 35 were found positive via HA, ELISA and PCR, respectively. In rapid test, 26/52 samples were found positive. Among different age-groups, 11/24 and 13/21 animals were positive in pups aged 4–8 and 8–12 weeks, respectively. All but one (34/35) positive samples were from unvaccinated animals. Labrador was found to be the most susceptible breed (n = 13) to infection. Considering PCR as the best test, 47.94% (35/73) prevalence of CPV was recorded. Among PCR positive samples, 3 and 32 belonged to type CPV-2a and CPV-2b, respectively. Type CPV-2c was not detected among the examined samples. Sequencing analysis of 9/10 CPV-2b isolates revealed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (A-G) at position 4106 (alanine to threonine) and suggested the occurrence of mutant, new CPV-2b in this area. As other major pathogen canine coronavirus was detected in 7/38 CPV negative samples. Conclusively, CPV-2 infection was detected in 47.97% cases of AGE of pups which warrants search for other pathogens in the diagnostic procedure. This work is among the few recent reports which depict the occurrence of a novel mutant (new CPV-2b) in India.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the concentrations of total (T-GSH), oxidized (GSSG) and reduced glutathione (GSH) in blood of clinically healthy calves, to assess the effect of sex and age together with the type of feeding on its concentrations, and to assess the relationships between glutathione and metabolic indices. A total of 117 Holstein calves at the age of 1 day to 6 months were divided according to age and together with the type of feeding into 4 groups: colostrum and transition milk (n = 20), native milk (n = 39), milk replacer (n = 29) and total mixed ration (n = 29). Blood serum was used for the assessment of the metabolic profile of calves. The concentrations of individual forms of glutathione (mean ± SEM) were as follows: T-GSH: 789.1 ± 19.4 µmol/l, GSSG: 54.2 ± 4.3 µmol/l, GSH: 681.6 ± 15.3 µmol/l, and GSH/GSSG: 41.1 ± 5.9, with the coefficients of variability of 26.6%, 85.3%, 24.3% and 157.4%, respectively. Age and the type of feeding affected GSSG ( P ≤ 0.01) and GSH/GSSG ( P ≤ 0.01). The relationships between glutathione and biochemical parameters were mostly weak. T-GSH correlated with creatinine ( P ≤ 0.05) and chlorides ( P ≤ 0.05); GSSG correlated with albumin ( P ≤ 0.01), creatinine ( P ≤ 0.01), cholesterol ( P ≤ 0.05), aspartate aminotransferase ( P ≤ 0.01), alanine aminotransferase ( P ≤ 0.01), gamma-glutamyltransferase ( P ≤ 0.05) and calcium ( P ≤ 0.05); GSH/GSSG ratio correlated with creatinine ( P ≤ 0.01), cholesterol ( P ≤ 0.05), aspartate aminotransferase ( P ≤ 0.05), gamma-glutamyltransferase ( P ≤ 0.01) and calcium ( P ≤ 0.05). The evaluation of individual forms of glutathione helps in estimation of redox status in healthy animals and their monitoring can detect the stress extent.",

The importance of this study was in determining the relation between insulin sensitivity in DP and insulin resistance in EL. A total of 30 normally fed Holstein-Friesian cows with a high body condition score (&gt; 3.75) were included in the study. Blood samples were collected in DP (weeks 5-7 ante partum ) and EL (weeks 1-2 post partum ). Cows in EL showed higher insulin resistance in comparison to DP due to a lower concentration of glucose and insulin, higher concentration of NEFA, lower value of revised quantitative insulin sensitivity check index and higher values of glucose:insulin and NEFA:insulin ratios (lower pancreas responsivnes to glucose and antilipolytic effect of insulin). Higher concentrations of insulin and glucose in the DP lead to a decrease in their concentrations and an increase in glucose:insulin and NEFA:insulin ratios in the EL. The revised quantitative insulin sensitivity check index in DP negatively correlates with the same index in EL, while positively correlating with the NEFA and NEFA:insulin ratio in EL. The EL revised quantitative insulin sensitivity check index value was influenced by dynamic changes (DP minus EL) in the insulin, NEFA, and glucose concentrations. The relationship between the indicators shows that higher insulin sensitivity in the DP increases resistance in EL in normally fed obese dairy cows.",

Identification and removal of persistently infected animals from infected herds is a crucial component to control BVDV infection. Only limited data on serum virus concentration in infected animals are available to date. Using one-step reverse transcriptase quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, we quantified the serum viral load in 40 BVDV infected animals. To control nucleic acid extraction, complementary DNA synthesis and polymerase chain reaction amplification, each serum sample was spiked with a known small amount of reference canine coronavirus. Detected ribonucleic acid copy number ranged from 2.2 × 10 6 to 7.4 × 10 8 per 1 ml of serum of persistently infected animals and from 6.6 × 10 4 to 3.3 × 10 7 of transiently infected animals. These findings support the idea that it is impossible to accurately distinguish between transiently and persistently infected animals just from a single blood sample. To use this testing as a means of declining costs of BVDV control programmes cannot be recommended and paired serum samples have to be investigated to confirm persistent infection.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess the udder health in lame dairy cows. The study was performed on 35 dairy cows which were admitted to the Clinic of Ruminants. The most frequent claw diseases were white line abscess (28.6%) and toe necrosis (28.6%), followed by digital dermatitis (17.1%), toe ulcers (14.3%), and sole ulcers (11.4%). The prevalence of mastitis in lame cows was 74.3% (26); clinical mastitis was detected in 5 (19.2%) and subclinical mastitis in 21 (80.8%) dairy cows. Distribution of mastitis was similar in terms of front (52.54%) and rear quarters (47.46%). For statistical analyses of mastitis grade in lame dairy cows, a six-point Mastitis Score was created based on physical examination of the mammary gland and results of California Mastitis Test. The Mastitis Score tended to be higher in cows with corium inflammation than in those with digital dermatitis (10.0 and 6.5, respectively). Microbiological culture of 24 positive milk samples was performed and intra-mammary pathogens were isolated in 18 (75%) samples. The most prevalent bacteria were coagulase negative staphylococci (50%), followed by Enterococcus spp. (16.7%), Proteus spp. (11.1%), and Aerococcus viridians (11.1%). Of the total bacteria, contagious pathogens were determined in two milk samples (11.1%). In conclusion, high prevalence of mastitis was detected in lame cows suffering from claw diseases without a significant effect of the type of claw diseases on the mastitis grade. Moreover, the dominating isolation of environmental pathogens may be a result of longer lying period of animals affected with lameness.",

    "abstract": "Infections associated with Escherichia coli are responsible for immense losses in poultry production; moreover, poultry products may serve as a source of pathogenic and/or resistant strains for humans. As early as during the first hours of life, commercially hatched chickens are colonized with potentially pathogenic E. coli from the environment of hatcheries. The source of contamination has not been quite elucidated and the possibility of vertical spread of several avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC) lineages has been suggested, making the hatcheries an important node where cross-contamination of chicken of different origin can take place. The recent technological progress makes the method of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) widely accessible, allowing high-throughput analysis of a large amount of isolates. Whole-genome sequencing offers an opportunity to trace APEC and extended-spectrum/plasmid-encoded AmpC beta-lactamases-producing E. coli (ESBL/pAmpC- E.coli ) along the poultry processing chain and to recognize the potential pathways of “epidemicˮ sequence types. Data from WGS may be used in monitoring antimicrobial resistance, comparative pathogenomic studies describing new virulence traits and their role in pathogenesis and, above all, epidemiologic monitoring of clonal outbreaks and description of different transmission routes and their significance. This review attempts to outline the complexity of poultry-associated E. coli issues and the possibility to employ WGS in elucidating them.",

Chlamydial abortion causes late term abortions with a worldwide occurence particularly in sheep and goats; it also leads to significant financial losses. Seroepidemiological studies provide useful data regarding the prevalence of the disease. Isolation of Chlamydia abortus as the causative agent of the disease is a time consuming and laborious procedure requiring appropriate biosafety measures. Serological methods are commonly used for routine diagnosis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is generally recommended for surveillance studies. In this study, a total of 833 blood samples obtained from 126 herds of sheep and goats located in all provinces of the Marmara region, Western Turkey, were analyzed. Total seroprevalence was found to be 25.81% through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. However, the proportion of seropositive herds was observed at 62.70%, which is higher than the total seroprevalence. This study confirms the presence of Chlamydia abortus exposure in sheep and goat herds in the Marmara region and provides original seroprevalence data in the provinces, which have not been reported so far. The data gathered are useful for the evaluation and elaboration on the seroprevalence of chlamydiosis in small ruminants in the Marmara region, Turkey.",

Selected immune and haematological indices were measured and challenge with Aeromonas salmonicida was conducted. The plant-based diet systemically modulated all oxidative stress biomarkers (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances; reduced and oxidised glutathione and their ratio) in the intestine. The ratio was elevated in all organs (liver, kidney, muscle and intestine) and an enhancement of respiratory burst and complement activity was observed even in the control fish. With the standard diet, an elevation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in the intestine and a decrease in some immune indices appeared after challenge. Less distinctive changes and the lowest mortality rate (the highest being with the plant-based feed) were obtained with immunostimulants. Increased total immunoglobulin, relative lymphocytosis and a decrease in the phagocyte count were observed. This study contributes especially by a thorough examination of oxidative stress indices in different tissues. The exact composition of these commercial diets is a trade secret; however, knowledge of their effects is extremely important for fish farmers using them; therefore, this study has a great practical impact.",

With their spreading use, safety concerns have warranted extensive research of nanotoxicity. This paper offers information about the occurrence, transport, and behaviour of metallic nanoparticles in the aquatic environment. It further summarizes details about parameters that dictate the toxicity of nanoparticles and discusses the general/common mechanisms of their toxicity. This review also focuses on fish exposure to nanoparticles, including the possibility of trophic transport through the food chain. Information on some of the most frequently used metallic nanoparticles, such as silver, gold, and titanium dioxide, is further elaborated on.",

    "abstract": "Hypodynamia is a method to simulate weightlessness (microgravity) in the laboratory conditions. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of chronic hypodynamia on the growth and development of the ovary and oviduct, plasma estradiol and progesterone concentration, and the onset of egg-laying in Japanese quail. The ovary weight gradually increased with age in both groups. However, the experimental birds subjected to hypodynamia showed a significant reduction in ovary weight relative to age-matched control between 21 and 42 days of age ( P &lt; 0.05). The number of yellow follicles with a diameter of less than 10 mm, between 10 and 15 mm and more than 15 mm was similar in both groups from 49 days to the end of experiment. The control birds had significantly longer oviduct than those of the test group from 28 to 63 days ( P &lt; 0.05) with the exception of day 49. The quail reared under hypodynamia laid their first egg about three days later than control. Plasma progesterone concentration in experimental quail was significantly reduced between 28 and 49 days ( P &lt; 0.05). Plasma estradiol concentration increased progressively with age in both groups. The differences between the groups were not significant at any age. These findings suggest that although hypodynamia negatively affects some of the examined variables, the female Japanese quail is able to grow and develop normally under conditions of simulated weightlessness.",

It is considered an endemic disease in Brazil and was diagnosed in all states. In relation to brucellosis, little is known about their prevalence in cattle herds from Para state, Brazil. Thus, this study aims to determine the occurrence of cattle serum reagent to brucellosis by a retrospective study of the results of serological tests from private laboratories in different regions of from Para state, Brazil. We selected three laboratories for the diagnosis of brucellosis located in the municipalities of Santarem, Novo Repartimento and Tome-Acu. The animals tested for brucellosis were all older than 24 months. We obtained a total of 7,724 test results from 14 municipalities. For the diagnosis of brucellosis it was performed agglutination test with buffered acidified antigen. Qui-square test was performed to assess the possible risk factors for brucellosis prevalence in relation to macro and micro region, animal category and breed, and Fisher's exact test was applied for the factors sex and vaccination history of the herd. We observed 792 positive cattle, resulting in an average prevalence of 10.25%. The prevalence was higher in cows and heifers when compared to bulls, and consequently higher in females compared to males. Herds vaccinated against brucellosis showed lower prevalence in relation to properties without vaccination. These results indicate that brucellosis is widespread throughout the state of Para, with a high prevalence of this disease. This results show the importance of convinces the cattle farmers and veterinaries of the importance of control this disease in the state.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Brucellosis, Amazon, cattle, survey.",

    "abstract": "One of most important reasons for low productive performance in ruminants is mineral deficiency in the diet. Several elements can be affected, but phosphorus is the most frequent deficiency in Brazil. Thus, the present work aimed to determine the occurrence of phosphorus deficiency in ruminants at Mossoro city, west region of Rio Grande do Norte (RN) state, Brazil, using serum biochemistry assay as a practice, fast and cheap tool for diagnostic. It were collected blood samples from 72 bovines (dairy cattle) from 9 farms, 50 sheep and 50 goats from 5 farms each, localized at Mossoro city periphery, RN. In these samples it were measured the activities of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase and concentrations of phosphorus, calcium and total proteins. The obtained results revealed phosphorus deficiency in all three evaluated species, and corroborate to the need of adequate supplementation of this mineral at evaluated region. The utilized serum biochemistry panel proved to be efficient for determination of phosphorus deficiency, being a way faster and cheaper than traditionally used evaluation techniques.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Mineral deficiency, phosphorus, cattle, sheep, goats",

A total of 10 Slovak warmblood horses (aged 6–15 years) trained for jumping were used. Blood samples were taken before and after the jumping training (control), immediately after prolonged exercise and after the following 36 h of rest. Control samplings showed no signs of exercise-induced dehydration, but an increase of haematological indices, increased concentration of lactate and increased activity of lactate dehydrogenase whose changes may be indicative of splenic blood efflux and activation of anaerobic metabolism. On the other hand, changes of biochemical indices (such as: increased alanine aminotrasferase, lactate dehydrogenase and creatine phosphokinase, decreased K and Fe, increased malondialdehyde and glutathione peroxidase) that are indicative for the muscle membrane leakage, oxidative stress and electrolyte imbalances, and alterations of intermediary metabolism were found due to the non-standard prolonged exercise. Although this study demonstrates that trained horses adapted to a certain exercise regimen are exposed to oxidative and metabolic stress by non-standard prolonged workload, further research is required to assign an appropriate resting regime needed to compensate for the induced biochemical changes.",

A total of eight sites were chosen on the Bílina River for sampling. Indicator fish chub ( Leuciscus cephalus L), roach ( Rutilus rutilus L . ) and brown trout ( Salmo trutta m. fario L.) in the total numbers of 24, 26 and 27, respectively, were sampled at four locations, since at the remaining sites fish were absent. Mercury concentrations in the muscle of sampled indicator fish were measured using cold vapour atomic absorption spectrometry on an AMA 254 analyser. The highest mercury content (0.12 ± 0.027 mg·kg -1 ) was found in the muscle of roach at the Ústí nad Labem site and the lowest mercury content (0.04 ± 0.008 mg·kg -1 ) in the muscle of brown trout from the Březenec (the first upstream site) site. A significant difference ( P &lt; 0.05) between the analyzed fish species was found only between chub (0.08 mg·kg -1 ) and brown trout (0.04 mg·kg -1 ) at the Březenec site. The priority of this study was to assess the mercury contamination of the Bílina River because this river flows through a heavy industrial activity in the region (especially production of petrochemicals, agrochemicals, sorbents, plasticizers and textile auxiliaries). Despite the fact that the Bílina is an extensively polluted river, the obtained mercury results were very low and did not exceed the limit of 0.5 mg·kg -1 set by Commission Regulation No. 1881/2006.",

Wistar rats were irradiated by 1-10 Gy of gamma radiation by 60 Co source. Value LD50/60 was 7.37 (4.68-8.05) Gy. Histone H2AX is phosphorylated by ATM kinase on serine 139 (γH2AX) quickly after the irradiation. It forms microscopically visible foci in the site of double strand breaks of DNA. Flow-cytometric method was used for quantitative detection. This study is the first one that evaluated dose-dependency of H2AX phosphorylation in peripheral lymphocytes of rats irradiated by whole-body dose 1-10 Gy. Our data show a dose-dependent increase in γH2AX in rat peripheral blood lymphocytes 1 h after whole-body irradiation by the dose of 1-10 Gy. We proved that phosphorylation of histone H2AX is a prompt and reliable indicator of the received radiation dose suitable for rapid measurement before the number of lymphocytes in peripheral blood starts to decrease. It can be used already 1 h after the irradiation for an estimation of the received dose of radiation. Blood samples can be stored in 4 °C for 23 h without significantly affecting the result.",

The concentration of lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), copper (Cu), iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) in the muscle tissue of bream and pikeperch was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. The mean concentration of toxic metals (Pb and Hg) in muscles of bream was 0.07 mg/kg and 0.03 mg/kg, respectively, and 0.10 mg/kg and 0.13 mg/kg in muscles of pikeperch, respectively.

It was found that the content of the analysed metals in fish muscles was low and did not exceed the values of limits admissible in the European Union. At the assumed mean and maximum concentration of Pb and Hg, the values of PTWI (provisional tolerable weekly intake) were not exceeded (i.e. 0.56% PTWI for Pb and 3.01% PTWI for Hg), therefore the consumption of fish originating from selected lakes of Warmia and Mazury does not constitute a threat to consumer health.",

Two sites used for mallard hunting were chosen, namely a flood-control reservoir in Moravia and a small fishpond in Bohemia. Lead concentrations were determined in the tissues of 20 mallards ( Anas platyrhynchos ) raised at those standing open water sites (n = 10 at each site) and killed there during the autumn hunting season with a steel shot. Control groups were made up of 20 mallards from the same breeding facility as experimental groups but raised in an enclosure without access to water (n = 10 at each site). Lead concentrations were determined in selected tissues (breast muscle, heart, liver, gizzard, kidney, feathers - quill base, lung, brain and humerus) by high resolution continuum source atomic absorption spectrometry. The results showed elevated lead concentrations in all tissues of mallards compared with control in the reservoir in Southern Moravia. The highest lead concentrations (mg/kg) were found in the humerus (14.254 ± 4.525 and 5.083 ± 0.748 for experimental and control mallards, respectively). In contrast, lead concentrations in mallards from small fishpond in Southern Bohemia were lower compared to control. Similarly, the highest lead concentrations were found in the humerus (2.219 ± 0.349 and 8.930 ± 1.012 for experimental and control mallards, respectively). This study extends very limited information about lead contamination of wild ducks in the Czech Republic in connection with hunting activities.",

The effect of additional vitamin E supplementation on oxidative and antioxidative status was evaluated as well. The study included 29 female dogs divided into 4 groups (groups 1 and 2 included females with a mammary gland tumour; groups 3 and 4 included healthy female dogs). Additional vitamin supplement containing α-tocopherol was given to the females of groups 1 and 4. Dogs from groups 1 and 2 were anaesthetized before surgery (ovariohysterectomy and mastectomy); anaesthesia was used also in group 3, but without performeing surgery. The content of vitamin E (free α-tocopherol), marker of antioxidative status, was measured in blood serum by liquid chromatography. The concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, marker of oxidative status, in serum and concentrations of protein and non-protein thiol groups, markers of oxidative and antioxidative status, in blood serum and in red blood cells were measured colorimetrically. In females with a mammary gland tumour from group 2, concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances was significantly higher than 14 days after surgery and compared to healthy ones as well. In females with a mammary gland tumour from group 2, concentration of protein thiol groups in serum was significantly lower and concentration of non-protein thiol groups in serum was significantly higher than in healthy controls. The values of protein thiols in erythrocytes in females with mammary gland tumour from group 1 were significantly higher before supplementation with vitamin E. The present study revealed that females with a mammary gland tumour were more burdened with oxidative stress compared to healthy dogs. The removal of the mammary gland tumour led to improvement of oxidative and antioxidative status. This is the first report focusing on the effect of additional α-tocopherol supplementation on reducing oxidative stress by increasing antioxidative activity in females affected with mammary gland tumour; however, we did not prove it.",

Moreover, functions of phagocytes and immunocompetent cells in peripheral blood were evaluated by flow cytometry. In total, sixty chickens of Ross hybrid broilers 308 were used in this experiment. Two experimental groups of 20 birds were continually fed for 14 days a diet containing deoxynivalenol at a dose of 1 and 3 mg·kg -1 ; 20 birds of the control group were fed uncontaminated diet. Morphometry showed only tendency to decrease the height of villi and surface area of duodenal mucosae in chickens fed the diet supplemented with 3 mg·kg -1 deoxynivalenol. Phenotyping of intraepithelial lymphocytes showed a decrease of CD45+ ( P &lt; 0.034) in duodenum of birds fed diets supplemented with deoxynivalenol. Examination of white blood cells showed a decrease of monocytes ( P &lt; 0.020) in chickens fed 3 mg·kg -1 of deoxynivalenol. Both experimental groups revealed higher metabolic burst of peripheral blood heterophils ( P &lt; 0.001).

The experimental feeding of chickens with deoxynivalenol resulted in immunomodulation of immunocompetent cells in duodenum and blood with mild atrophy of intestinal villi, mainly after the feeding of the dose of 3 mg·kg -1 . We proved that even low doses of deoxynivalenol can cause changes in haemathological, immunological and morphological profiles already during two weeks, and lead to the activation of compensatory-adaptive mechanisms with unfavourable impact on health and performance of birds.",

    "abstract": "An experiment on the effects of hormonal preparations (Gonazon™ and Supergestran containing gonadotropin-releasing hormone) on the course of reproduction of farmed grayling ( Thymallus thymallus L.) broodstock and their post-stripping mortality was performed at the hatchery in spring 2009. Four-year-old marked grayling females (n = 80) were randomly divided into four groups. The fish were intramuscularly injected with Supergestran at a dose of 30 μg·kg -1 body weight (Group 1), with Gonazon TM at a dose of 30 μg·kg -1 (Group 2) and with saline 0.9% NaCl (Group 3), while fish of Group 4 were left without treatment (control group). No effect of treatment on the total number of ovulated females (70–80%) was found at the end of the stripping period. Slightly higher (non-significant) percentage of ovulated fish in the first stripping time (3 days post injection) was observed in fish treated with Gonazon. The 30-days post-ovulatory mortality remained unaffected by hormone treatments in all groups. Significant differences ( P &lt; 0.001) were found in the fertilization rate of egg samples from the first stripping time. The highest fertilization rate (98.6%) was found in fish treated with Supergestran, lower fertilization rates (61% and 65%) in fish treated with saline and control, respectively, and the lowest fertilization rate (39%) in fish treated with Gonazon. Other reproductive indicators remained unaffected by treatment in all groups. Based on our results, Supergestran is the most suitable preparation for the enhancing of artificial reproduction efficiency of farmed European grayling in fishery practice. The study brings important information about artificial reproduction of grayling broodstocks reared in controlled conditions.",

Each of the ten monkeys, females, two years old, was administered orally 2 ml × 10 9 TCID 50 of the Bio-10-SAD Bern rabies strain. The animals were monitored for 90 days. Subsequently, the animals were sacrificed and their brains were examined for presence of the vaccination rabies virus by the immunofluorescence and PCR methods. The occurrence of anti-rabies antibodies prior to and following administration of the vaccination rabies virus was also evaluated. No clinical signs of rabies were observed nor did any of the animals die of rabies following application of the virus. No rabies was detected in the study animals by post mortem examination. All of the 10 animals developed anti-rabies antibodies during the 90 days following administration of the rabies virus. It can be concluded, that Bio-10-SAD Bern virus administered at a dose equal to the tenfold maximum dose specified for field uses is safe to monkeys of the rhesus macaque species. This study is the first of its type performed in rhesus macaque monkey species.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to analyse the status of the genetic structure of two autochthonous Croatian Podolian breeds (Istrian cattle and Slavonian Syrmian Podolians). The study comprised 20 randomly selected blood samples of each cattle breed. The genotyping was performed on 11 microsatellites (TGLA227, BM2113, TGLA53, ETH10, SPS115, TGLA126, TGLA122, INRA23, ETH3, ETH225, BM1824) as recommended by International Society of Animal Genetics and Food and Agriculture Organization. The procedure enabled the identification of 423 (96.14%) genotypes, indicating the validity of DNA analyses in blood samples and adequacy of the selected microsatellite markers. Likewise, there was the total number of 203 alleles with minimal differences among the studied groups. The differences ( p &gt; 0.05) were observed within the genotypes of the studied groups regarding the microsatellite loci. The distribution of the genetic relationship was presented by Wright F coefficients. The F IS had negative values for the TGLA 227 locus in both studied groups and for ETH3, ETH225 and BM1834 loci in the Slavonian Syrmian Podolians. This obtained data with relative high values of heterozygosity also shows a genetical influence of other breeds. Almost all F IT values were appropriate (0.31905) as a result of excessive selection effects. The mean value of F ST (0.07336) indicates that the average degree of genetic variability of the studied breeds was not significantly different despite certain differences in individual loci. The observed specific polymorphism of loci shows that the Istrian cattle and the Slavonian Syrmian Podolians have similar genetic characteristics, but also that there are certain differences between the breeds and even inter-breed differences. The findings indicate a relationship between the breeds and their suitable purity for interbreeding but they also indicate certain danger to certain parts of genome within the studied species. The results can be applied in the protection and breeding programs for the preservation of autochtonous Croatian Podolian breeds.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to highlight the importance of nontuberculous mycobacteria species in the pathology of various reptilian pet species as well as their epidemiological significance of infection transmission to humans. Faeces samples from six living reptiles and organs from ten carcasses were submitted to bacteriological testing during the years 2003–2015. Positive colonies from one faeces sample and two organs showed the presence of a gene coding 65kDa antigen common for all mycobacteria. Further identification to the species level revealed that the isolates belong to Mycobacterium fortuitum and Mycobacterium avium subsp. hominissuis , later subjected to drug susceptibility testing which confirmed high resistance levels in both isolates. In conclusion, there is a great significance of the occurrence of nontuberculous mycobacteria in captive and pet reptiles, presenting reptiles as possible hosts representing a serious threat of transmission of high resistance mycobacterial isolates to humans. To our knowledge, this is the first report of M. avium subsp. hominissuis occurrence in reptiles.",

    "abstract": "This study compares the effects of four dilutions of the gadolinium-containing contrast media (1:100; 1:400; 1:800; 1:1,200) administered to the elbow on the quality of magnetic resonance images. All the examined dilutions had a positive effect on image quality, and 1:800 was regarded as the optimal dilution of gadolinium for viewing the elbow because it imparted good contrast to the joint cavity without obliterating the contours of articular surfaces. Transverse, sagittal, and dorsal low-field magnetic resonance images were obtained in 24 canine cadaver front limbs. The musculus biceps brachii, m. triceps brachii, m. extensor carpi radialis, m. flexor carpi ulnaris, the articular surfaces, the medial coronoid process and the anconeal process of the ulna were well visualized by High Resolution Gradient Echo, XBONE T2 and Spin Echo T1 sequences in the sagittal plane. The biceps brachii, pronator teres, flexor carpi radialis, extensor digitorum communis, extensor carpi radialis, deltoid muscle and the articular surface of the medial condyle of the humerus were very well visualized by 3D SST1 and XBONE T2 sequences in the transverse plane. The triceps brachii muscle, extensor digitorum lateralis muscle, superficial digital flexor, deep digital flexor and the medial condyle of the humerus were very well visualized by the Spin Echo T1 sequence in the dorsal plane. This article describes for the first time the use of the gadolinium contrast agent administered to the canine elbow joint during magnetic resonance modality. Magnetic resonance arthrography can be a helpful visualization technique in treating canine soft tissue elbow injury.",

The aim of the current study was to assess the seroprevalence of porcine cysticercosis in Northwestern Romania and the influence of several risk factors such as age, sex and season. The study included 1,288 pigs originating from 7 different counties and was conducted between May 2014 and May 2015. All pigs were reared in the traditional backyard pig system. Of these, 226 were young and 1,062 were adult pigs, 188 were males and 1,100 females. Serum samples were collected. The apDia Cysticercosis Antigen ELISA (apDia, Belgium) commercial kit was used to identify the viable cysticerci of Taenia sp . Out of the 1,288 serum samples, 83 were seropositive (seroprevalence: 6.4%). The risk factors’ analysis showed that age (3.1% juveniles vs 7.1% adults [ P &lt; 0.03]) and season (9.3% fall vs 11.8% winter [ P &lt;0.00001]; 3.4% spring vs 1.2% summer [ P &lt;0.00001]) had a significant influence on the seropositivity, while sex had no significant influence (3.7% males vs 6.9% females, P = 0.1). Considering the genus specificity of ELISA commercial kit, the serology should be correlated with the post mortem examination in order to confirm the disease and have a Cysticercus cellulosae specific prevalence.",

    "abstract": "The study included 2 groups of lambs (GL): control (C) and experimental (E) which since day 11 of life was receiving an addition of dried Saccharomyces cerevisiae preparation. At the age of 100 days, 12 lambs from each group were weaned from mothers for 12-h pre-slaughter fasting, and transported to a slaughter house. Blood was sampled for analyses: before weaning from mothers (BST 1), before and after transport (BST 2 and 3). Blood samples were assayed for: values of neutrophils and lymphocytes, N:L (neutrophils to lymphocytes ratio), cortisol and glucose. After 24-h chilling of lamb carcasses, musculus longissimus dorsi was subjected to measurements of final acidity (pH 24 ) and colour (CIE Lab), and muscle samples were collected for evaluation of water absorption and shear force. The GL and BST had a significant effect on the N:L ratio. No significant differences were found in the cortisol concentration between groups of lambs. This indicator was significantly different in the analyzed blood sampling time ( P &lt; 0.01). In the entire period of pre-slaughter handling, in group C cortisol concentration increased × 8.5, whereas in group E it increased × 4.3 compared to the baseline value. In both groups, the study showed an increase ( P &lt; 0.01) in glucose concentration in BST 3 compared to BST 1 and BST 2. Meat of lambs from group E was characterized by lower ( P &lt; 0.05) values of pH 24 , WHC, SF, and indicator a*. The obtained results suggest the advisability of applying a preparation of dried brewer’s yeast in rearing slaughter lambs in order to strengthen their immunity and to alleviate effects of pre-slaughter stress.",

Toxigenic microfungi of Aspergillus and Penicillium species are considered to be of major relevance for human and animal health. The presence of these toxigenic microfungi in foodstuffs and feedstuffs raises a potential risk of mycotoxins (for example presence of aflatoxins, cyclopiazonic acid, ochratoxin A, patulin or citrinin). In order to reduce the risks for consumers’ health, it is necessary to set rapid methods for toxigenic microfungi isolated from foodstuffs and also feedstuffs. Application of chromogenic media and reagents presents one of the possibilities. The selected strains of toxigenic microfungi, producing mycotoxins, were tested on chromogenic media. The chromogenic media and reagents in our study are suitable for a microbiological and mycological laboratory. The benefits of chromogenic media and reagents include a rapid diagnosis within 48–72 h, simple preparation, easy availability and relatively low prices.",

They are rarely associated with either local invasion or malignancy, unlike infiltrative lipomas and liposarcomas, respectively. Three dogs, a 10-year-old mixed-breed female of 35 kg body weight, a 10-year-old mixed-breed male of 30 kg body weight, and an 11-year old female German shepherd of 38 kg body weight, were presented with a 3–6 month (median, 5 months) history of progressive left pelvic limb lameness and thigh swelling. A lesion affecting the soft tissue of the thigh and the left sciatic nerve was suspected in all dogs. A left thigh magnetic resonance (MR) revealed a homogenous, well circumscribed tumour in the mixed-breed dogs and two similar tumours in the German shepherd. The tumours were interposed between the semimembranosus and semitendinosus muscles. The treatment involved surgical extirpation of the tumours. A follow-up examination 12 months post operation showed mild lameness and proprioceptive deficits in the operated limb in all the dogs. The withdrawal reflex and the cranial tibial reflex were normal. Neither mass nor thickening were palpable in the thigh region. Although intermuscular lipoma is rare, it should be suspected in dogs with progressive monoparesis. Magnetic resonance is a valuable imaging method for diagnostic precision and pre-operative planning. Quick diagnosis and decompressive surgery are required to allow recovery.",

Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was employed as a method to detect arsenic concentrations in the tissues. Arsenic deposition in the monitored biological matrices of adult animals showed no significant differences between sexes. The ratio of arsenic concentration in the skeletal muscle as compared with concentration in other tissues was 1:2.96 in the liver, followed by 1:4.35 in kidneys, 1:1.07 in the heart, 1:2.73 in lungs, 1:3.12 in ovaries, 1:3.30 in testicles, 1:5.90 in bones, 1:114.68 in fur, and 1:60.05 in faeces.

To the authors’ knowledge, no studies monitoring the occurrence of infectious agents responsible for kennel cough have been carried out in Poland. Therefore, the objective of our study was to determine which of the four pathogens most frequently isolated in other countries are predominant in north-eastern Poland. Swabs from the upper respiratory tract and tracheal lavage fluids from dogs (n = 40) exhibiting symptoms of this disease were analysed. Canine herpesvirus, canine parainfluenza virus, canine adenovirus type 2 and Bordetella bronchiseptica were identified by polymerase chain reaction. At least one of the above-listed infectious agents was found in all dogs. The predominant pathogen within the area under our study, both in mono- and co-infections, was canine herpesvirus (32/40), whereas canine adenovirus type 2 occurred least frequently (4/40). The effectiveness of detection of selected pathogens from both types of study material was also compared. Tracheal lavage fluid was more suitable for the isolation of canine herpes virus, canine parainfluenza virus, and Bordetella bronchiseptica . Swabs from the upper respiratory tract were more suitable for the isolation of canine adenovirus type 2.",

Goats were divided into four groups: Group A was a control (without Zn supplementation). The remaining three groups (B, C, D) were supplemented with Zn in various forms. Group B was supplemented with zinc oxide, Group C with zinc lactate, and Group D with zinc chelate. Individual protein fractions (albumins, α1, α2, β1, β2 a γ-globulins) were identified by electrophoretic analysis. All supplemented groups showed the trend of a positive influence of Zn on γG fractions in the serum protein of the goats; this tendency was significant only in Group C. Moreover, Group C had significantly the highest total protein values and albumins. The results indicated that a feed enriched with various forms of Zn had a significant influence on the quantity of individual protein fractions of blood serum. Our results provide new knowledge on the values of individual protein fractions of serum goats and should be taken into consideration when interpreting the serum protein profile with regard to periparturient goats. Furthermore, we showed the possible positive or negative effects on the values of individual fraction on serum proteins with organic and inorganic zinc form supplemented rich in diet.",

After 5 d of space flight duodenal and jejunal alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity of the experimental group was compared with the AP activity in quails of the same age hatched on the Earth (laboratory controls). Short-term microgravity leading to decreased food intake resulted in significant increase of AP activity in both duodenal and jejunal enterocytes (P<0.001) of the experimental quails. The results suggest that increased AP activity probably reflects the delayed functional development of the small intestine as a consequence of inappropriate food intake during non-physiological conditions of space flight.",

The animals were divided into four groups and two separate experiments were carried out (a, b): (1) intact control group; (2) birds were fed with T-2 toxin contaminated feed and not vaccinated; (3) repeatedly vaccinated (on day 23 of age) control group which received uncontaminated feed; (4) birds were both repeatedly vaccinated and fed the T-2 toxin contaminated diet. Blood samples, from which sera titres were measured, were taken on days 7 and 14 of the experiments. It was found that heamagglutination titres were different in the two experiments even in the control (1) group because of the different efficiency of the first immunization at the hatchery. Titres on day 7 showed increases in all groups except for the group fed lower T-2 contaminated diet (a, group 2) but during the second week they increased only in the groups fed the diet with a lower dose of T-2 toxin. On the contrary, a higher dose of T-2 toxin contamination of the diet resulted in a dramatic decrease during the second week (b, groups 2 and 4). The results suggested that contrary to most of the previously published data, feeding of T-2 toxin contaminated feed with an amount of 2.35 mg.kg -1 did not decrease, but increase the antibody formation against attenuated Newcastle disease virus even without a second vaccination on day 1 of the experiment, whereas a higher amount of T-2 toxin (4.18 mg kg -1 ) decreased to day 14 after the repeated vaccination.",

In cats, symptoms manifested as inappetence, diarrhoea, loss of weight, changes of hair coat, and, in particular, conjunctivitis with mucoserous discharge and prolapse of the third eyelid. In dogs, clinical symptoms manifested with alteration of the digestive apparatus (anorexia, increased peristalsis, vomiting and diarrhoea), loss of weight, jaundice and skin lesions (pruritus, alopecia and dermatitis interdigitalis). The performance of all working dogs was reduced significantly. Both in dogs and cats, a reliable diagnosis is only possible through repeated coprological examination and demonstration of Dicrocoelium eggs. As far as the therapeutic procedures are concerned, albendazole administered for four days was only found fully effective in the cat as well as in the dog, in which praziquantel for 4-5 days was also sufficient.",

    "abstract": "It is important to determine varying effects of anaesthetics agents. One of the adverse effects of general anaesthetics are the exogenous sources of reactive oxygen species. In this study, the effects of xylazine-tiletamine-zolazepam (XTZ) and fentanyl-tiletamine-zolazepam (FTZ) combinations on plasma oxidant-antioxidant indicators were compared in sheep. Ten ewes received two different anaesthetic combinations in a ten-day interval. XTZ group was injected with xylazine and tiletamine-zolazepam. FTZ group was injected with fentanyl and tiletamine-zolazepam. Blood samples were collected before and at the 30, 60, 120 min, 24 h and 3 days after anaesthesia. Both anaesthetic regimens caused an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations in plasma. The MDA concentrations at 60, 120 min and 24 h in the XTZ group were significantly higher than in the FTZ group. Glutathione (GSH) concentration at 30, 60, 120 min and 24 h was significantly lower than baseline values in XTZ group, while there was only a decrease at 120 min in the FTZ group. GSH concentrations in the XTZ group were significantly lower at 60 and 120 min compared with the FTZ group. Beta carotene concentration was decreased at 120 min and 24 h in the XTZ group, while it decreased only at 120 min in the FTZ group. Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (CAT) activities decreased at 120 min and 24 h only in the XTZ group. There were no significant differences in β-carotene concentration, activities CAT and GSH-Px activities between groups. In conclusion, both XTZ and FTZ anaesthetic regimens induced oxidative stress in sheep. XTZ combination has more detrimental effect than FTZ combinations on particularly MDA and GSH concentrations. Therefore, FTZ anaesthetic combination is considered to be more suitable for sheep anaesthesia, due to less deteriorating effects on oxidant/antioxidant balance.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the serum concentrations of total and lipid-bound sialic acid in sheep naturally infected with Babesia ovis before and after treatment. Thirty diseased sheep and ten control animals were used. Babesia infection was confirmed with Giemsa's staining of blood smears. Compared to the control animals (1.351 ± 0.100 mmol l -1 ; 0.385 ± 0.001 mmol l -1 ), a marked increase of serum total and lipid bound sialic acid concentrations (1.929 ± 0.101 mmol l -1 ; 0.479 ± 0.004 mmol l -1 , respectively) was obtained in infected sheep ( p &lt; 0.05). One week after treatment, serum total and lipid bound sialic acid concentrations significantly decreased (1.554 ± 0.005 mmol l -1 ; 0.411 ± 0.02 mmol l -1 , respectively) ( p &lt; 0.05). Despite this decline, total and lipid bound sialic acid concentrations of treated animals were still signifi cantly increased in sera compared to the control animals ( p &lt; 0.05). When the infected animals were treated with an antiparasitic drug (diminazene aceturate), the serum total and lipid bound sialic acid levels had a tendency to decrease to the normal ranges. It can be concluded that Babesia ovis infection induced marked and persistent elevations of serum total and lipid-bound sialic acid concentrations, suggesting that these indicators would indirectly promote the invasion and presence of the parasite in the host.",

From the original set of data in 305 earlier analyzed dogs we selected 89 animals, i.e. those concerning the four most numerous breeds, (34 Dachshunds, 16 Schnauzers, 23 German Shepherd Dogs and 16 Poodles), and compared their 85 behavioural traits and interactions with their household members. The results were evaluated using the chi-square test. Dogs belonging to these four breeds differed significantly in only 28 (32.9%) of the indicators under study. Except for a few German Shepherd Dogs all members of our group were considered to be companion animals and household members. They were no longer used as earth dogs or hunting, guarding/herding dogs. Breed characteristics were taken into consideration only exceptionally. People kept them for pleasure and not for their original skills, once carefully selected for and modified. On the contrary, these skills became undesirable in urban environment. Despite that, dog breeds are designated by their original functions and use, even though the anthropomorphic selection pressures continue. People want their dogs to adapt more and more to the intimate co-existence in rural and urban environments. Thus, canine behaviour is under massive selection pressures.",

    "abstract": "An entirely plant-based feed mixture was prepared to minimize the potential risk of transmitting prion infections through animal feed. It consisted of two protein components (soya extracted meal and lupin seed meal) and was compared with a diet containing animal protein components (fish meal). The objective of the present work was to prepare and verify the effect of the entirely plant-based diet on the performance, selected qualitative indicators of eggs and the hens' state of health. A specially prepared feed mixture containing fish meal was used as a control diet. The tested plant-based diet administered to experimental hens produced no negative effect on egg production variables such as number of eggs per hen or laying performance. The weight of eggs laid by experimental hens was significantly higher (61.66 g, P &amp;#x2AAC 0.01), as compared with the control group (60.03 g). The higher average weight of eggs in the experimental group increased the production of egg mass per layer by 540 g in 252-day experimental period. the beneficial effect of the plant-based diet was demonstrated particularly in the improved egg quality, manifesting itself in a highly significant improvement in yolk colour ( P &amp;#x2AAC 0.01) and a significant decrease ( P &amp;#x2AAC 0.05) in cholesterol level in egg yolk. Haematological examination did not indicate statistical differences between experimental and control layers in red blood cell indices such as RBC, haemoglobin, hematocrit, MCHC, MCH, and MCV, while white blood cell indices showed a highly significant increase ( P &amp;#x2AAC 0.01) in Le in experimental hens. Biochemical tests performed in blood plasma revealed significantly lower molar concentrations of glucose ( P &amp;#x2AAC 0.05) and highly significantly lower levels of total lipids, cholesterol, lipoproteins (HDL and LDL) in experimental hens ( P &amp;#x2AAC 0.01), as compared with the control group. The results of the study confirm that animal protein in diet for laying hens can be replaced by combination of vegetable protein feeds (soybean and lupin protein) without a negative impact on their performance and health, thereby contributing to solving issues of food safety (a prevention of prion infections).",

The basis of the diets was maize silage and alfalfa hay supplemented with wheat meal in diet W, or maize meal in diet M. The experiment was performed on four Black-Spotted bulls with mean live weight of 525 kg, which were fed twice daily at 06.30 and 18.30 h. Experimental animals were fitted with ruminal fistulae and duodenal T-shaped cannulae. Cr 2 O 3 was used as a marker of nutrient flow to the duodenum. Rations were formulated so that the ratio of starch to crude fibre (CF) was 2.1:1 and the percentage of CF was maintained at 17% (DM). Duodenal chymus was collected at 2-h time intervals. Starch origin significantly affected ruminal fermentation. Concentration of propionic, butyric and lactic acid was higher with wheat than with maize meal. When the maize meal was the source of starch there was a significantly higher flow of fat, CF, nitrogen-free extract, and starch into duodenum. Differences in duodenal flow of crude protein were not significant across the starch sources. Intake of wheat meal or maize meal increased duodenal flow relative to intake by 33% or 42 % respectively.

The aim of this study was to assess and compare the toxicity of the preparation PAX-18 for embryonic and juvenile developmental stages of zebrafish ( Danio rerio ). The acute toxicity tests with juvenile fish aged 2–3 months were conducted according to the method OECD No. 203 in 5 series. For embryo toxicity test the method OECD No. 212 was used in 5 series. The semistatic methods were selected. The results of toxicity tests (the number of dead individuals at particular test concentrations) were subjected to probit analysis using the EKO-TOX 5.2 programme to determine LC50 values of PAX. The LC50 mean value of PAX for juvenile D. rerio was 749.7 ± 30.6 mg·l -1 (67.5 ± 2.8 mg·l -1 of Al) and 731.5 ± 94.1 mg·l -1 (65.8 ± 8.5 mg·l -1 of Al) for embryonic stages of D. rerio. The sensitivity of juvenile and embryonic stages to PAX were comparable ( p &gt; 0.01). The acute toxicity values of PAX-18 found in tests on D. rerio were 6–13 × higher than the concentration which is usually applied to waters (5–10 mg·l -1 of Al). Therefore, the acute toxicity effect on fish can be considered minimal.",

The results of our experiment indicate that a combined influence of ionizing radiation and administered cadmium chloride resulted in a significant decrease in serum glucose concentration and the influence was more evident than that caused either by cadmium chloride or irradiation alone. The changes in serum glucose concentration observed on days 7 and 14 in gamma-irradiated chickens were lower than those induced only by administration of cadmium chloride.",

The broilers were sampled at three different sampling times (prior to loading, after loading, and after 70 km transport) at three different ambient temperatures (-5 to +5 °C, 10 to 20 °C, 25 to 35 °C). Corticosterone contents in broilers after loading and after transport were significantly higher ( P &lt; 0.01) than before loading. The highest corticosterone concentration was found in broilers that were handled (loaded and transported) at lower temperatures (-5 °C to +5 °C) and this value was significantly ( P &lt; 0.01) lower than in broilers handled under both other monitored temperature ranges. The results of this study prove that the stress-inducing procedure to which commercial broilers are exposed in connection with transport to the slaughterhouse induces strong changes in selected biochemical indices, and that these changes are highest in winter months at a lower ambient temperature.",

In the current twelve-week-long study, 32 dairy cows at 3 to 6 weeks after parturition were divided into four groups. Diets were balanced to have an analogical content of crude protein and energy. Experimental groups (MI, ME, MET) were mixed to the milking concentrate consisting of 20% bean seeds (MI - MISTRAL cultivar with a low content of anti-nutritional substances; ME - MERKUR cultivar with high content of anti-nutritional substances; MET - MERKUR cultivar with technologically reduced the amount of anti-nutritional substances). Clinical evaluation of dairy cows’ health and feed intake showed no negative effect of the bean supplementations. Energy, nitrogen and mineral metabolisms were not impaired either. No significant differences were found between groups in milk performance (daily milk yield, protein and lactose production) during the study. On the basis of these results, the bean can be used in 20% in the milking concentrate of dairy cattle. Health risks associated with anti-nutritional content of the native bean are not significant for high-producing dairy cattle.",

The aquarium fish Poecilia reticulata were exposed to the radiation effect of 60 Co at the doses of 20 and 30 Gy (11.36 Gy/min). Frequent intravital haemorrhages were observed from day 8 after the exposure. A general long-term body fading appeared from day 10 to day 30 of the experiment. Microbiological and histological examinations were done on days 7, 14, 21 and 28. Individual muscle cells were bound together into fascicles surrounded by connective tissue. No significant morphological changes were observed on skeletal muscle cells, except for more watery connective tissue. The presence of Escherichia coli and Aeromonas hydrophila was proved in the body surface samples and in aquarium water based on the microbiological test. A moderate increase of the number of E. coli and A. hydrophila was observed in the intestines in both exposed groups (20 and 30 Gy) depending on the time that elapsed from the exposure (from 1 × 10 1 to 6 × 10 3 CFU). However, the heart, liver and musculature remained sterile.

Thirty lambs were slaughtered at 60 days of age; thirty were weaned at 60 days and fed until 120 days with flakes (60%) and food supplements, and then slaughtered. Muscle tissues were obtained from two muscles, namely m. semitendinosus and m. longissimus dorsi of all lambs. For each fibre type, area perimeter and diameter (maximum and minimum) were measured and slow-twitch oxidative fibres, fast-twitch glycolytic fibres, fast-twitch oxidative-glycolytic fibres were histochemically differentiated. The muscles were stained for myosin ATPase, and succinic dehydrogenase. At 60 days, females had fibres larger than males, whereas the opposite was observed at 120 days. Besides, at 60 days, the lambs born by single birth had fibres larger than those born by multiple birth, whereas the opposite was observed at 120 days. Single lambs were heavier than twin lambs and multiple lambs. Fast-twitch glycolytic fibres had the largest size, followed by slow-twitch oxidative and fast-twitch oxidative glycolytic fibres. The dimensions of fibre types in m. longissimus dorsi were larger than in m. semitendinosus ( P &lt; 0.001).These muscle fibre characteristics are thought to be important factors influencing meat quality, which is often related to metabolic and contractile properties as determined by the muscle fibre type distribution.",

It manifests also the unique ability of agglutinating complement- and antibody-coated erythrocytes. Moreover, it shows the ability to activate immune system cells, including the process of phagocytosis. In this review also the factors that determine the amount and activity of conglutinin in mammalian serum were presented, including environmental conditions and infectious agents, such as various types of bacteria and viruses. The broad scope of conglutinin is genetically controlled and, therefore, this collectin may constitute a useful and crucial factor in cattle husbandry.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to compare the influence of fat supplementation in the form of full-fat soybean seeds and hydrolyzed palm oil as energy sources for dairy cows in early lactation. During the first 8 lactation weeks, 17 dairy cows divided into group S (n = 8) and group C (n = 9) were observed. The basic diet was the same for both groups. The differences were in the composition of the concentrate mixture, which had a balanced content of nutrients. In group S the fat source was heat-treated soybean seeds, while in group C the fat source used was hydrolyzed palm oil. The two diets started to be fed on the day of calving. Blood samples were taken weekly (1st–5th week) and 8 weeks after delivery. At the end of the experiment ruminal fluid was taken. During the experiment BCS in both groups deteriorated similarly. In group S it decreased from 3.8 ± 0.2 to 3.3 ± 0.3 and in group C from 3.5 ± 0.4 to 3.1 ± 0.4. A better performance of hepatic metabolism was proved in group S. In group S lower concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids were identified in the 3rd (0.96 ± 0.38 vs. 1.76 ± 0.63 mmol l -1 ; p &lt; 0.01) and 8th (0.32 ± 0.29 vs. 0.78 ± 0.48 mmol l -1 ; p &lt; 0.05) week after calving. The gamma-glutamyl transferase (EC 2.3.2.2) activity in serum indicates a better liver parenchyma condition in group S where no increased activity was identified above the reference range. An increased activity was identified in group C from the 2nd week with a significant difference between groups detected in the 2nd (0.41 ± 0.07 vs. 0.66 ± 0.25 μkat l -1 ; p &lt; 0.05) and 4th (0.42 ± 0.05 vs. 0.64 ± 0.25 μkat l -1 ; p &lt; 0.05) weeks after delivery. There were no significant differences found between groups in bilirubin and aspartate transaminase (EC 2.6.1.1) but a general tendency toward lower values is apparent in group S. No significant differences were found between groups by the examination of ruminal fluid. Based on these results we can conclude that full-fat soy was better utilised than hydrolysed palm oil and represents a suitable alternative for increasing energy concentration in the diet for dairy cows. On the other hand, the development of liver steatosis in cows make controversial the usage of fat as an energy source for fresh cows even if their BCS is around 3.5–3.8 and it may not be recommended generally.",

Chickens were exposed to the La Sota vaccine for 30, 60 or 300 s in a closed chamber of the device, thus enabling constant particle size during vaccination. No adverse reaction to the given vaccine was recorded, and the immunity, developed no later than 7 days after vaccination, lasted for at least 49 days which was confirmed by challenge infection using Herts 33 strain of Newcastle disease virus. Maternal antibodies did not influence the development of immunity.

    "abstract": "While intensive fish production has many advantages, it also has a number of drawbacks as regards disease and stress. To date, there has been no conclusive review of disease resistance at Czech fish farms. The aim of the study was to describe briefly the existing salmonid breeding practice in the Czech Republic and to point out the trends and new possibilities gaining ground around Europe. However, the present situation in the Czech stocks is not rare at all and therefore it is used here as a model example representing numerous breeding practices in Europe. Stress and disease resistance in fish is polygenic and quantitative, making selection for such traits difficult. In recent years, however, fish breeding methods have developed rapidly, with the use of genetic analysis tools, for example, now allowing much greater selection accuracy. Gradual progress in understanding the importance of individual genetic markers offers many new options that can be utilised in breeding practice. New selection methods, such as quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and genomic selection, are increasingly employed in European aquaculture. Next generation sequencing techniques now help in the finding of new and promising QTLs that can be used in assisted selection. This review maps the current progress in improving salmonid resistance to stress and disease in aquaculture and at the same time provides the breeders with a short overview of the latest tools of genetically controlled breeding and of the newest products available at the European market.",

The samples were obtained from the mountain Tríbeč (southwest part of the Slovak Republic). A total of 36 samples in 3 age categories of meat were analysed. The effect of age on the intramuscular (IMF) fat content was analysed. The highest ( P &lt; 0.05) IMF content was found in the samples from the youngest animals (18.07%), the lowest ( P &lt; 0.05) in the sub-adult animals. Significant ( P &lt; 0.05) differences were found in palmitic acid (C16:0). Significant decrease of heptadecanoic acid (C17:0) as an effect of age was analysed in the samples. Of the important fatty acids, the most abundant in all age categories of wild boar were oleic (C18:1 cis 9), palmitic (C16:0), and linolelaidic acid (C18:2 cis n6). Differences in the content of mentioned acids were significant ( P &lt; 0.05). In α-linolenic and γ-linoleic acids, non-significant ( P &gt; 0.05) differences were detected. Significant differences ( P &lt; 0.05) between age categories were found in cis-11-eicosenoic (C20:1 n9) and cis-11,14-eicosadienoic acids (C20:2 n6). Significant differences ( P &lt; 0.05) were found in PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids), MUFA (monounsaturated fatty acids), and SFA (saturated fatty acids) concentrations. The highest PUFA content was typical for the samples from the oldest animals, MUFA from the sub-adults, and SFA from the youngest wild boar. More significant results were observed in the normalized data with the factor component scores. The wild boar fatty acid profile is significantly affected by age.",

Forty-eight male rats were randomly divided into eight groups, including normal and diabetic groups. Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin at 40 mg·kg -1 body weight. Rats were treated with an intraperitoneal injection of the extract for three weeks. At the end of the experimental period, fasting blood samples were collected, and blood glucose and liver enzyme activity were measured. This study demonstrated that serum glucose levels in diabetic groups treated with F. angulata were significantly lower than those in diabetic rats ( P &lt; 0.001).

A total of 11 ejaculates were collected from five donkey stallions (between one and three from each animal). Each ejaculate was assessed for volume, concentration and motility, and the seminal plasma biochemically examined after centrifugation. Total protein, creatinine, urea, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine-amino-transferase (ALT), aspartate-amino-transferase, creatine kinase, gamma-glutamyl-transferase, lactate-dehydrogenase (LDH), sodium, potassium (K + ), calcium, phosphate, chloride, copper (Cu), cholesterol, vitamin E (Vit E), magnesium (Mg 2+ ), seminal plasma selenium (Se SP) and seminal plasma zinc (Zn SP) were identified. Biochemical analysis of the seminal plasma was then statistically evaluated using the Spearman coefficient of correlation. A significant positive correlation between ALP, ALT, LDH, Cu, Se SP and Zn SP and sperm concentration was found. Also there was a significant positive correlation between Vit E and sperm motility. Finally, there was a significant positive correlation between urea, K + , Mg 2+ and the ejaculate volume. This is the first report about selected biochemical components of donkey's seminal plasma that we know of. However, further research using a larger number of individuals is necessary to confirm that these components of seminal plasma are useful as markers of ejaculate quality in donkey stallions.",

    "abstract": "Equine arteritis virus is classified in the Arteriviridae family and causes reproductive and respiratory disorders. The host spectrum includes many species of the Equidae family. Horses, donkeys and mules are the most sensitive species. The infection was serologically investigated in adult donkeys on small private family type enterprises in eastern and south-eastern Anatolia in this study. A total of 1,532 samples were collected from 28 different locations in 6 different provinces in these two regions. The number of donkeys sampled from each farm was between 1 and 3. Serum samples were tested by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). As a result of sero-controls, 53 animals were positive (3.45%). The presence of infection was determined in all the provinces; Elazığ (7%, 17/241), Tunceli (2.4%, 3/122), Van (2.9%, 10/342), Bitlis (4.6%, 5/107), Şırnak (2.7%, 12/440) and Siirt (2.1%, 6/280). Seropositivity was detected in 22 of the 28 locations. In this study, data were obtained from a significant number of animals for the first time in these regions. Although the values were not high, the findings revealed the presence of infection in the majority of the investigated sites. Despite the fact that the incidence was not high in donkeys probably due to restricted management conditions, the incidence may increase over time and may pose a risk for thoroughbred horses unless necessary measures are taken.",

This case report aimed to describe the successful use of medical ozone in the treatment of a dehisced wound in a feline patient that presented this type of FIV-associated complication. Here we present a case of a 12-year-old, mixed-breed, male, FIV-positive cat with purulent arthritis affecting the shoulder, elbow, and the carpal joints with subsequent periostitis and arthrogryposis affecting the right forelimb. After a thorough investigation (clinical examination, X-rays) it was decided that limb amputation would be the proper choice. The surgical wound did not tend to heal, followed by rejection of the suture material, skin necrosis, and wound dehiscence. After 13 days following the surgery with allopathic treatment and no improvement, oxygen-ozone-therapy was started. Clinically, oxygen-ozone therapy showed significant results after the first session: borders of the wound got into the contraction phase, got attached to the underlying tissues, and exudates were significantly diminished. The therapy continued every 2 days showing improved blood perfusion of the affected area and a visible advancement of the contraction phase daily with complete healing in 1.5 months.",

    "abstract": "Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are carcinogens causing endocrine disruption. While production of PCBs is now banned, wildlife exposure still occurs due to environmental contamination. We investigated thyroid toxicity in wild ungulates using three-dimensional primary thyrocyte cultures exposed to PCB 138 for 24, 48, and 72 h at concentrations ranging within 0–3000 ng/ml. Thyrocyte viability ranged within 78.71–118.34%, 98.14–104.45%, and 84.16–106.70% in fallow deer-, mouflon-, and roe deer-derived cells, respectively. Viability decreased significantly in fallow deer ( P = 0.012) and roe deer ( P = 0.002) thyrocytes exposed for 48 h at 30 ng/ml. While cytotoxicity ranged within 2.36–16.37%, 3.19–9.85%, and 2.76–11.21% in fallow deer, mouflon, and roe deer, respectively, only roe deer displayed significantly higher cytotoxicity at a 3 ng/ml exposure ( P &lt; 0.05) and lower cytotoxicity at 30 ng/ml ( P &lt; 0.01). Exposure to 30 ng/ml for 24 and 48 h induced reactive oxygen species in fallow deer. Iodide uptake at 30 ng/ml exposure increased after 24 h in fallow and roe deer, but showed a significant drop after 48 and 72 h in fallow deer, mouflon, and roe deer. Thyroxine T 4 release at 30 ng/ml exposure decreased significantly after 48 and 72 h; 24, 48 and 72 h; and 48 h in fallow deer, mouflon, and roe deer, respectively. Our findings indicate time- and species-dependent effects of PCB on performance and thyrocyte function. Use of cell culture models reduces the number of experimental specimens, increases test species welfare and replaces whole organisms with specific target cells.",

    "abstract": "Milk and dairy products constitute an important source of energy and nutrients for humans. Food preferences may significantly influence the actual consumption (and thus nutrition) of people at the population level. The objective of the present large-scale survey was to specify current preferences for milk and dairy products with regard to age and sex. The study was conducted across the Moravia region, Czech Republic, on a sample of 451 individuals divided into 4 age groups: children, adolescents, young adults, and elderly people. A graphic scale questionnaire was administered, with respondents rating their degree of preference for each food item by drawing a mark on a 35 mm line. Out of the 115 items in the questionnaire, 11 items represented dairy products. Data was analysed by means of a general linear model using IBM SPSS Statistics software. Preference for milk was lower in the elderly group than the other groups ( P &lt; 0.01). In children, the most preferred dairy product was cream, which was in contrast with the elderly group. Significant sex differences were only found with low-fat yoghurt ( P &lt; 0.01). The overall preference for dairy products (21.6) was lower than the average preference for all foods on the list (22.5). The cross-sectional study revealed intergenerational differences in preferences for specific dairy products, which were most marked in case of cream, processed cheese, blue cheese, and buttermilk. The knowledge of these differences might help promote more focused action at the community level directed at increasing the overall consumption of dairy products in the population.",

Analyses showed that the arithmetic means of cadmium concentration in cow kidney and liver are higher than in young bovine ( P &lt; 0.0001), but not in muscle ( P = 0.227). The mean cadmium concentration in cow kidney (0.595 mg·kg -1 ) was twice as high as in young bovine kidney (0.285 mg·kg -1 ) for the entire studied period. The mean concentration of cadmium in cow liver (0.113 mg·kg -1 ) was higher compared to young bovine liver (0.078 mg·kg -1 ). The mean concentration of cadmium in cow muscle (0.008 mg·kg -1 ) was comparable with young bovine muscle (0.006 mg·kg -1 ). The evaluation of time trends showed increasing concentrations of cadmium for cow (increasing slaughtering age) and young bovine kidney and decreasing concentrations for cow and young bovine muscle, but no significant change for liver. The estimated Cd burden of the entire population is worthy of attention (10% were over the tolerable dose of 2.5 μg·kg -1 body weight and week). For more than 50% of four to six-year-old children the burden exceeded the tolerable weekly intake. The contribution of food belonging to the group of meat and meat products, including cattle tissues, to usual cadmium exposure is only 5%. Nevertheless, the food safety recommendation is not to consume cow kidney as food.",

The aim of our study was to evaluate milk amyloid A (MAA) as indicator of udder inflammation. We used 24 dairy cows from a herd with 120 Slovak Pied cattle. In addition to bacteriological examination, the following indicators were determined in all quarter milk samples. On the basis of results of clinical examination, Californian mastitis test (CMT), and number of Somatic cell count (SCC), four groups of quarter milk samples were formed. The levels of MAA in both subgroups of Group 1 (healthy cows), divided by the number of SCC - IA (n = 10), IB (n = 15), determined at repeated samplings, differed significantly from the initial levels ( P &lt; 0.01). Highly significant correlation (R 2 = 0.272), was detected between SCC, and MAA in Group 2 (n = 27) at individual collections ( P &lt; 0.01), while in the Group 3 (n = 25) the level of both indicators decreased by the end of the experiment despite higher initial concentrations ( P &lt; 0.01). No significant differences in MAA were observed between individual collections in Group 4 (n = 6). No positive correlation (R 2 = 0.525) was detected between SCC and MAA in this group. The obtained results allowed us to conclude that MAA in milk can act as a marker of inflammation of the udder only in the initial, asymptomatic stages of dairy cow mastitis. The experiment was one of first studies with MAA in Slovak Pied cattle.",

Twenty macaque monkeys were given medetomidine (25 µg·kg -1 ) and ketamine (3 mg·kg -1 ) intramuscularly to the deltoid (n = 10 animals) or gluteus (n = 10 animals) muscles. Behavioural changes, loss of aggressiveness, immobilisation time and cardiorespiratory changes were recorded. The effect of drugs was reversed after 20 min by i.m. administration of atipamezole at the dose of 250 µg·kg -1 . Highly significant differences ( P &lt; 0.001) were found between groups with gluteal or deltoid administration of drugs on the onset of immobilisation effect (71.3 s and 108.3 s, respectively), and immobilisation time (152.7 s and 254.4 s, respectively). In the gluteus muscle group, the grasp reflex was still present at the beginning of immobilisation and slowly wore off in 15–45 s. The same was valid for muscle tone. There were no differences in cardiorespiratory parameters in any of the groups. Animals of both groups recovered in 3–6 min after atipamezole administration. Administration of drugs to the deltoid muscle resulted in a more rapid onset and increased effect of immobilisation than administration to the gluteus muscle. Both in veterinary and human medicine, injection to the deltoid muscle may be more convenient in all cases, when rapid and more prominent effect is desirable as in premedication before surgery or in emergency medicine. The study is the first to compare the effect of administering drugs to different muscles and the results may improve the practice of intramuscular injections in animals and in humans.",

Potential transfer of infection by faecal-oral and aerogenic routes was also investigated. Cloacal swabs and ceacal content were analyzed microbiologically. Identification of C. jejuni was carried out by polymerase chain reaction. Observation of passive immunity of broilers from 3 days of age showed that no transfer of C. jejuni infection occurred up to 12 day post-infection (p.i.). Observations of active immunity in fourteen 21 days old chickens infected with C. jejuni showed that 6 chickens were positive on day 3 p.i. and all infected chickens were positive on day 5 p.i. Investigations of the transfer of C. jejuni by faecal-oral route revealed positivity in two broilers on day 3 p.i. and in all tested chickens on day 5 p.i. Aerogenic transfer of infection was not recorded. This was one of the first studies in our country dealing with passive and active immunity of broiler chickens against C. jejuni and spreading of this zoonotic disease.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress in the body occurs when the production of free radicals overwhelms the antioxidant defence systems. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a tiletamine/zolazepam-xylazine-tramadol combination on the antioxidant status, lipoperoxidase and blood cell indicators in eight miniature pigs. Baseline measures were recorded prior to anaesthesia, then the animals were anaesthetized with the combination of tiletamine/zolazepam (3.5 mg/kg), xylazine (1.32 mg/kg), and tramadol (1.8 mg/kg). Blood samples were collected from the anterior vena cava at 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 min, 24 h, and 72 h after anaesthesia. Plasma malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase concentrations were measured by colorimetry, and red blood cell counts, white blood cell counts, haemoglobin and packed cell volume were determined using an automated cell counter. The results showed that the concentration of malondialdehyde increased significantly at 30 and 60 min after the injection ( P &lt; 0.05), whereas glutathione peroxidase and catalase activity increased slightly ( P &gt; 0.05) then returned to baseline values after 90 min ( P &gt; 0.05). Superoxide dismutase activity increased significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) at 30 and 60 min, and then gradually decreased to baseline values after 90 min. Changes in red blood cell counts, haemoglobin and packed cell volume were not significant, while white blood cell count decreased significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) at 30 and 60 min. Our study is the first to demonstrate that tiletamine/zolazepam-xylazine-tramadol provide antioxidant effects, which may be proposed for alleviating the stress of examination and research at veterinary clinics or long-distance transportation.",

Fourteen animals were divided into two groups: a control group without dietary supplementation and an experimental group administered 50 mg/kg body weight/day of 1,3-1,6-β-D-glucan for 60 days. At the beginning of the experiment (day 0) and on days 15, 30 and 60, blood was sampled from the jugular vein to determine and compare immunological indicators.

Chub were caught at seven localities on the Svratka and Svitava rivers in the agglomeration of Brno in 2008. The results were compared to those obtained from the same sites in 2007. Total mercury was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry using an AMA 245 analyzer, and methylmercury was determined by gas chromatography (using an electron-capture detector) after acid digestion and toluene extraction in chub muscle. The highest concentrations of total mercury and methylmercury (0.12 ± 0.14 and 0.07 ± 0.02 mg·kg -1 fresh weight, respectively) were found in Svratka before junction (south of Brno), whereas the lowest concentration of mercury and methylmercury in chub (0.06 ± 0.01 and 0.04 ± 0.01 mg·kg -1 ) was detected in Svitava before junction with the Svratka River. Total mercury in sediments ranged from 0.01 to 1.05 mg·kg -1 dry weight, the highest value was detected in the sediment from Rajhradice. The lowest content (0.01 mg·kg -1 ) was at Kníničky. Hazard indices calculated for the selected localities showed no health risk for either a standard consumer or a fishing family. Fish from the Svitava and Svratka rivers show very low mercury concentration and hazard index and their consumption poses no health risk from total mercury and methylmercury contamination.",

The long term outcome was available for all horses. The overall success of the surgery without considering influencing factors was 61%. Thirteen horses (39%) returned to the stereotypical behaviour sooner or later after the surgery. In this retrospective study we confirmed the dependence of success of the surgery on the necessity of early treatment of the problem (up to 6 months after the appearance of initial signs), with the significance level of P = 0.037. Any connection between age, breed or sex, and positive outcome of the surgery were not confirmed during statistical evaluation. When the horses were diagnosed early enough, an 80% success rate in surgical treatment performed within 6 months from the initial signs of crib biting was recorded, which seems to be very promising. It can be concluded that surgical treatment of crib biting by modified Forsell’s myectomy is the recommended option in the therapy of this oral stereotype.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of prochloraz on neopterin and biopterin concentrations in blood plasma of common carp as possible indicators for monitoring perturbations of the immune system caused by xenobiotics like pesticides. Prochloraz is a widely used imidazole fungicide in horticulture and agriculture. A total of 60 juvenile common carp were divided into four groups of 15 fish and exposed to prochloraz at concentrations of 0, 50, 150 and 380 µg·l -1 , respectively. The total length of exposure was 28 days. Neopterin and biopterin concentrations were determined by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Our results indicated that concentrations of neopterin (25 ± 7.6 nmol·l -1 ) and biopterin (190 ± 29 nmol·l -1 ) in plasma of untreated common carp were comparable with those in mammals. Neopterin concentrations significantly ( P &lt; 0.01) increased after exposure to prochloraz in comparison to non-exposed fish, while biopterin concentrations were not influenced by exposure to prochloraz. This study contains new data on neopterin and biopterin concentrations in fish plasma and investigates neopterin and biopterin in their non-traditional role as markers of cell mediated immunity of fish associated with pesticide exposure.",

    "abstract": "The background of aggression is very complicated and the basis of its occurrence has not been well explained yet. It is thought that tendency to aggressiveness is an effect of both environmental and genetic factors. Aggression is a very undesirable behavioural trait in dogs living with humans. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between two polymorphisms: DRD4 intron II VNTR and C/T substitution in exon I HTR2B genes and aggressive behaviour in dogs. The VNTR polymorphism in the DRD4 gene was detected by agarose gel electrophoresis following PCR amplification, whereas C/T substitution in the HTR2B gene was analysed using amplification created restriction site-polymerase chain reaction (ACRS-PCR). A total of 121 dogs of several breeds were analyzed. All animals were classified based on a veterinary interview and observation in two groups: aggressive (n = 21) and non-aggressive (n = 100). Significant differences in DRD4 genotype frequencies between aggressive and non-aggressive dogs were observed ( P &lt; 0.05). The study provides a clear evidence of an association of VNTR polymorphism within intron II of the DRD4 gene with the occurrence of aggressive behaviour in dogs. Moreover, the findings give good justification for further research aimed at evaluation of the possibility of using this genetic marker in Marker-assisted Selection.",

The quinolone resistance and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants ( qnr A, qnr B, qnr S and aac(6’)-Ib-cr ) of 85 Salmonella isolates from chicken carcasses were investigated in this study. Isolates were serotyped according to the Kauffman-White-Le Minor scheme, and broth microdilution method was used to determine quinolone resistance. Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes were investigated by real-time PCR and positive results were confirmed by sequencing. Among the Salmonella isolates, 30/85 (35%) and 18/85 (21%) were found to be resistant to enrofloxacin (MIC ≥ 2 mg/ml), and danofloxacin (MIC ≥ 2 mg/ml), respectively. All the isolates were negative for qnr A, qnr B and aac(6’)-Ib-cr genes, nevertheless 2% ( S. Brandenburg and S. Dabou) were positive for qnr S ( qnr S1 determinant).

    "abstract": "Radiofrequency ablation is a possible palliative treatment for patients suffering from pancreatic neoplasia. However, radiofrequency-induced damage to the peripancreatic tissues during pancreatic ablation might cause fatal complications. The aim of this experimental ex vivo study on pigs was to verify ablation protocols and evaluate whether or not the cooling of peripancereatic tissues during pancreatic ablation has any benefit for their protection against thermal injury. Radiofrequency ablation was performed on 52 pancreatic specimens obtained from pigs. During each pancreatic ablation, continuous measurements of the temperature in the portal vein and duodenal lumen were performed. Peripancreatic tissues were either not cooled or were cooled by being submerged in 14 °C water, or by a perfusion of the portal vein and duodenum with 14 °C saline. The effects of variation in target temperature of the ablated area (90 °C and 100 °C), duration of ablation (5 and 10 min) and the effect of peripancreatic tissues cooling were studied. We proved that optimal radiofrequency ablation of the porcine pancreas can be reached with the temperature of 90 °C for 5 min in the ablated area. The perfusion of the duodenal and portal vein by 14 °C saline was found to be the most effective cooling method for minimizing damage to the walls. Continuous measurement of temperatures in peripancreatic tissues will provide useful feedback to assist in their protection against thermal injury. This therapy could be used in the treatment of pancreatic tumours.",

Four groups of ex vivo models of pig stifle joints were prepared and tested: a model with intact CCL (group 1), a model with partial CCL rupture (group 2), a model with CCL rupture stabilized with 7 mm Mersilene ® strip (group 3), and a model with CCL rupture stabilized with 5 mm PET/PCL biomaterial strip (group 4). The models were loaded in the standing angle of 100° and the maximum load (N) and the shift (mm) were monitored. The mean maximum peak power and the shift were 1266.0 ± 146.9 N and 13.7 ± 2.5 mm for group 1, and 1164.7 ± 228.2 N and 1 6.8 ± 3.3 mm for group 2, respectively. In all cases after reaching the maximum load, a tibial fracture occurred but never a CCL rupture. In groups 3 and 4, the initial fixation failure occurred in the mean values of 375.7 ± 81.5 and 360.4 ± 52.0 N, respectively, and with a bigger shift of 52.3 ± 11.9 mm and 39.4 ± 14.6 mm, respectively, compared to group 1. A critical point of failure was the anchoring in the bone. It can be concluded that the PET/PCL substitute in the ex vivo model has mechanically comparable properties with the clinically used Mersilene ® , and based on its proven ability to carry stem cells it could be appropriate for partially ruptured CCL protection.",

An increased amount of glycosaminoglycans in synovial fluid is believed to be a marker of secondary osteoarthritis, regardless of its primary cause. The aim of our study was to define the relationship between glycosaminoglycans in the synovial fluid and joint disorders, age, and body weight. The samples of synovial fluid were obtained from dogs suffering from secondary secondary osteoarthritis (n = 35) and from control dogs (n = 18); control dogs had normal body weight. The results were compared among joints of dogs with secondary osteoarthritis divided into groups according to the criteria mentioned above and control dogs. Glycosaminoglycan concentrations in synovial fluid were measured using dimethylmethylene blue assay. The lowest mean value of glycosaminoglycans in synovial fluid was measured in the control group. Significantly higher glycosaminoglycan content ( P &lt; 0.05) was found in synovial fluid isolated from obese dogs compared to control dogs. Furthermore, we observed an age-related trend, in which the highest mean values were reached either in old dogs or pups. Despite the absence of significant differences in glycosaminoglycan values among dogs suffering from various types of secondary secondary osteoarthritis, the highest mean values were measured in fragmented coronoid processus group. Our data suggest that abnormally increased body weight has an impact on glycosaminoglycan concentration in synovial fluid which may imply faster degradation and turnover of joint cartilage. Such observation has not yet been published in veterinary medicine.",

    "abstract": "A two-year old male warty chameleon ( Furcifer verrucosus ) weighing 160 g was presented for veterinary examination following 4 weeks of decreased ability to catch insects with the tongue and difficulty in swallowing the prey. Non-invasive endoscopy did not reveal any macroscopic changes of the oral cavity mucosa or the cranial part of the esophagus. Dorsoventral and laterolateral plain and contrast radiographs revealed enlargement of the medial part of the liver without any visible abnormalities in the regions of the esophagus, stomach or small intestine. Abnormalities in the plasma chemistry profile included transient hyperglycaemia (52.68–57.18 mmol/l) and hyperuricaemia (452.70–622.20 μmol/l). The chameleon was examined at 7, 20 and 22 weeks after initial examination. Its body weight decreased to 120 g. A blood profile revealed normoglycaemia (16.37–10.22 mmol/l) and hyperphosphataemia (2.92–3.06 mmol/l) at the last three examinations. The chameleon died suddenly 33 days after the final examination. Necropsy revealed the presence of a large liver cyst, filled with fluid. The liver had lost all of its normal structure. The kidneys showed a large area with fibrosis and multiple uric acid tophi. The post mortem findings were defined as liver with fatty degeneration and moderate fibrotic changes with large cyst, subchronic nephritis with uric acid tophi, and mineralization in the myocardium. This paper describes the first documented case of transient hyperglycaemia in a warty chameleon ( Furcifer verrucosus ) associated with chronic liver disease and subchronic nephritis.",

CLA has different bioativas properties and is original of the incomplete biohidrogenation of the linoleic and linolenic acids carried by the rumen bacteria or by the desaturation of the trans-11 in the mammary gland and small intestine. The fat addition to diets of the lactating cows has been common practice as form of increasing the energy density of the diet without to cause the disturbances metabolic provoked by the increase of the carbohydrates inclusion quickly fermented, mainly in cows of high production, because in the first weeks of milking the lactating cows are in negative balance energy in face of the food intake is not maximized still. Diets supplemented with fat and roughage:concentrate relationship, as well as the effectiveness of the fiber of the roughage can increase the milk production, decreasing the fatty acids production and altering his profile in the milk. Fat milk is formed by great amount of saturated fatty acids of short chain and the use of diets with added fat, alter his pattern, reducing the amount of saturated fatty acids by increase of the unsaturated. Like this, several works have been carried to study the amount and fat type to be added the diet, his acceptability and digestibility with the purpose of increase the contents of CLA and acids trans-11 in fat milk.",

In this study we investigated the expression of AQP4 in the gastrointestinal tract of the pig using immunohistochemical staining. We found no presence of AQP4 in the different regions of the pig stomach. In the porcine small intestine moderate immunoreactivity to AQP4 was detected in enterocytes (along the villi and in the bottom of the crypts), duodenal Brunner’s glands and in enteric ganglia in cells lying in close vicinity to myenteric as well as submucous neurons. In superficial epithelial cells of the colonic mucosa as well as of caecal and colonic glands a very strong immunoreactivity to AQP4 was found. Both in the myenteric and submucous ganglia of the large intestine AQP4-positive cells surrounding enteric neurons were observed. We concluded that AQP4 expression in the porcine gastrointestinal tract showed some species-dependent differences in relation to other species. Based on the presented distribution pattern of AQP4, it is likely that the aquaporin plays a role in mucous (but not acid) secretion and intestinal absorptive processes in the pig.",

    "abstract": "We compared four diluents (Andromed, dimethylacetamide, dimethyl sulphoxide, Triladyl) used for semen cryopreservation in wild ungulates from the family Cervidae , i.e. roe deer ( Capreolus capreolus ), red deer ( Cervus elaphus ), and fallow deer ( Dama dama ). Epididymal sperm samples were collected and analysed immediately using Computer Assisted Sperm Analysis with the module for concentration and motility determination and, after equilibration, frozen and placed in liquid nitrogen for one month. After thawing, the samples were again subjected to the same examination procedure. Influence of cryopreservation and choice of the cryoprotectant was assessed by monitoring sperm concentration, average head area (HA), average velocity and progressivity (VAP), beat frequency (BF), total motility (MO), total progressive motility (PR), circular tracks (CT) and mucous penetration (MP). We observed no significant differences in sperm concentration between cryoprotective diluents or fresh and post-thaw samples in all species. All motility indicators (MO, PR, VAP, BF, CT) were influenced by the treatment but did not differ significantly between diluents used in red and roe deer. In fallow deer, commercial diluents (Andromed, Triladyl) resulted in better sperm survival than the alternatives (dimethyl sulphoxide, dimethylacetamide). Only HA showed significant differences ( P &lt; 0.001) in all species based on the diluent, with no effect of treatment. In contrast, MP was influenced by both the diluent and the cryopreservation process in roe deer and, partly, fallow deer. In future studies, we suggest expanding both the members of the Cervidae family examined and the sample size. Knowledge how to optimise cryopreservation protocols for different mammalian species has implications for conservation reproductive medicine of endangered wildlife.",

    "abstract": "Cross-compliance checks are a tool of the Common Agricultural Policy to promote agri-environmental objectives relating to the environment, animal welfare, and food safety. This mechanism consists of paying direct subsidies to farmers who comply with prescribed requirements. Compliance with animal welfare requirements in the Czech Republic is supervised by the State Veterinary Administration. This study aimed to find the main deficiencies identified as part of cross-compliance checks and to assess the trends of the most frequent defects during the period under review, i.e. 2016–2020. The data for the analysis were received from the Central Veterinary Administration of the State Veterinary Administration and included the results of 2,031 checks carried out. Shortcomings were found in 14.52% of cases. Detailed analysis showed that significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) the highest frequency of violations was found in the areas of ‘nutrition and watering’ (294; 29.85%) and ‘spatial requirements’ (274; 27.82%). Based on the evaluation of trends, a significant ( P &lt; 0.05) decrease in the frequency of violations in the field of compliance with holder duties and animal hygiene standards of animals was detected. The results of this work show that animal welfare is continuously improving on farms. However, the aim should be to reduce deficiencies to a minimum for all indicators. In view of the results of this study, it is necessary to focus primarily on improving the quality of nutrition, providing better housing standards with emphasis on space and equipment used, and intensifying daily checks of animals.",

The aim of the study was to clarify the effects of testosterone and tacrolimus on the gastrocnemius muscle following sciatic injury. The study was done on 20 rats (n = 5 in each group) whose left sciatic nerve was crushed for 10 s. The sham group (S) of animals received no medicine; the testosterone group (Tes) received testosterone (5 mg/kg, s.c.); the tacrolimus group (Tac): received tacrolimus (5 mg/kg, p.o.); the testosterone and tacrolimus group (Tes+Tac) received testosterone (5 mg/kg, s.c.) and tacrolimus (5 mg/kg, p.o.) daily for four weeks. The gastrocnemius was assessed by gross observation of the plantar surface of paws; the pelvic limb mass muscle and the muscle diameter ratio of the left pelvic limb to the right one by ultrasonography. The gastrocnemius muscle index (GMI) of the left and right pelvic limb, muscle colour, and pathologic changes were also studied. Pathology study of the gastrocnemius included fatty infiltration, muscle atrophy, presence of inflammatory cells and fibrosis formation. Heel redness and swelling were seen in group Tac. No significant difference was found in the GMI between the Tes and S groups ( P &gt; 0.01); its value was higher than in the Tes+Tac and Tac groups ( P &lt; 0.01). One rat in group Tes had fatty infiltration grade II. Inflammatory cells were grade I in group Tes but fibrosis formation was grade I in group Tes+Tac. Our results show that tacrolimus and testosterone administration may shorten sciatic nerve regeneration time. Testosterone may diminish gastrocnemius muscle atrophy after sciatic nerve crush.",

Transcriptome libraries were created from the blood samples using high-throughput sequencing; Gene Ontology functional enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses were performed for differentially expressed genes to identify the pathways and candidate genes associated with training and locomotor performance. In total, transcriptome analysis screened 33 significantly differentially expressed genes; of these, 23 and 10 were up-regulated and down-regulated after training, respectively. These differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in metabolic pathways associated with exercise physiology, including sphingolipid metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, and the cGMP-PKG signalling pathway.

For this purpose, 60 male Japanese quails ( Coturnix japonica f. domestica ) were used. From the age of 35 days, the birds were given boric acid added to regular soybean meal maize mixed feed as well as drinking water. Experimental groups: Control (no additive), F100: 100 mg/kg boric acid into feed, F300: 300 mg/kg boric acid into feed, W100: 100 mg/l boric acid into drinking water, and W300: 300 mg/l boric acid into drinking water. Both primordial ( P &lt; 0.001) and mature ( P &lt; 0.05) sperm counts increased in F300 and W300 groups. Supplemented boric acid in drinking water (300 mg/l) increased the tubule diameters of the testicle ( P &lt; 0.05). Because of the rising levels of boric acid in the feed and water groups, lipid peroxidation levels increased in testicular ( P &lt; 0.001), hepatic, and renal tissues ( P &lt; 0.01). Glutathione (GSH) levels rose in high boric acid groups in testicular and hepatic tissues ( P &lt; 0.001). Different tissues responded differentially to high amounts of boric acid in terms of antioxidant enzyme activity ( P &lt; 0.001). As a result, boric acid at high doses showed beneficial effects on spermatological activity; however, continued use caused lipid peroxidation in tissues and some pathological problems in liver tissue.",

Confirmed detection of E. coli serogroup O157 ranges from 1.2 to 23.2% and that of serogroup non-O157 from 0.1 to 14.7%. Most isolates from the pig-farming environment or obtained from slaughterhouses contain the stx 2e gene which is associated with porcine oedema disease. STEC isolates obtained from pork meat belong to the low-to-moderate risk category, though they do have the potential to cause illness in humans. The most effective prevention is the perfect cooking of meat.",

    "abstract": "Infrared thermography is a relatively new tool used in the evaluation of stress and health disorders in animals. This study aimed to assess changes in rabbit temperature in response to acute stress. The mean surface temperature of the inner corner of the eye was measured using a thermal camera in 12 rabbits of 3 breeds (four individuals of Mecklenburger Piebald Rabbit, Castor Rex Rabbit, and Large Light Silver Rabbit each) exposed to handling and tattooing of the ears. The mean surface temperature and the standard deviation in the inner corner of the eye in rabbits measured in their home cage was 36.75 ± 1.02 °C and was significantly lower ( P &lt; 0.01) than that measured during subsequent handling, tattooing and restraint. It was also lower in comparison with the mean temperature measured 30 min after tattooing when the rabbits were returned to the home cage (37.78 ± 0.54 °C). The surface temperature increased ( P &lt; 0.01) in response to handling when the rabbits were removed from the cage (38.22 ± 0.42 °C), and reached a maximum during tattooing (38.62 ± 0.52 °C). No significant difference was determined between the breeds ( P &gt; 0.05) at any stage of measurement. Changes in the surface temperature of the inner corner of the eye in rabbits took the same course in all three studied breeds of rabbits. An increase in temperature occurred during the initial handling of rabbits unaccustomed to human handling, and this increase persisted throughout the entire period of handling associated with tattooing.",

The experiment was carried out on 10 clinically healthy Black and White calves during the first seven days of postnatal life. The concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in blood plasma was determined with radioimmunoassay. The kidney function was assessed by clearance methods, using para-aminohippuric acid and inulin. The blood plasma ANP concentration increased with age. On the first day the mean concentration of ANP was 5.72 ± 1.34 pmol/l, on the 7th day it was 14.34 ± 2.09 pmol/l. The ERBF and ERPF during the first week of life showed variations, mean ERBF ranging within 280.22 ± 10.30 ml/min/m 2 (1st day) and 338.25 ± 13.72 ml/min/m 2 (7th day) and ERPF ranging between 179.77 ± 8.27 ml/min/m 2 (1st day) and 245.22 ± 9.86 ml/min/m 2 (7th day). The mean GFR on the first day was 35.68 ± 2.10 ml/min/m 2 and significantly ( p &lt; 0.01) increased on the second day 49.97 ± 1.76 ml/min/m 2 , subsequently GFR remained on a stabile level average 51.06 ml/min/m 2 . The studies showed no correlations between plasma ANP concentration and ERPF (ERBF) and GFR. These data indicate that in calves during the first seven days of postnatal life endogenous ANP did not change the effective renal blood (plasma) flow and glomerular filtration rate.",

The objective of the study was to assess changes in the size and shape of fat globules due to heat sterilization by using image analysis methods. The study included a selection of suitable methods of preparation mounts, taking microphotographs and making overlays for automatic processing of photographs by image analyser, ascertaining parameters to determine the size and shape of fat globules and statistical analysis of results obtained. The results of the experiment suggest that changes in shape of fat globules due to heat sterilization are not unequivocal. We found that the size of fat globules was significantly increased ( p &lt; 0.01) due to heat sterilization (117 °C, 20 min), and the shares of small fat globules (up to 500 μm 2 , or 100 μm 2 ) in the samples of heat sterilized processed cheese were decreased. The results imply that the image analysis method is very useful when assessing the effect of technological process on the quality of processed cheese quality.",

Forty Saidi rams were divided into 4 groups (n = 10). Group 1 (control) was fed 500 g/head/day concentrate feed mixtures (CFM) plus wheat straw ad libitum . Groups 2, 3 and 4 were fed 500 g/head/day CFM plus corn cobs or sugar cane tops or sugar cane bagasse (these roughages were treated with 1% urea), respectively. Serum testosterone, glucose and total cholesterol levels were determined and semen evaluations were carried out every 15 days. Testicular size, scrotal circumference and body weight were recorded each month. At the end of the experiment, 12 rams were allowed to mount 114 healthy ewes to evaluate the pregnancy rate for each group. The results have shown that the body weight, daily body gain, testicular size and scrotal circumference increased (p &lt; 0.01) in the treated groups as compared to controls with advancing age. At the end of the experiment (90 days), testicular size and scrotal circumference increased ( p &lt; 0.01) in the treated groups as compared with the control. The testosterone level (ng/ml) in treated groups increased (2.18 ± 0.31 ng/ml in group 2; 2.35 ± 0.24 ng/ml in group 3, and 1.97 ± 0.16 ng/ml in group 4) significantly ( p &lt; 0.01) as compared with group 1 (1.76 ± 0.09 ng/ml). Moreover, supplementation of treated agricultural byproducts had a significant improving effects on the semen quality. The semen volume increased, along with individual motility and live sperm percentages. Pregnancy rate in this study indicated that rams of groups 2, 3 and 4 yielded a higher pregnancy rate (83.33%, 86.67% and 81.48%, respectively) than group 1 (74.07%). Agricultural byproducts such as corn cobs, sugar cane tops and sugar cane bagasse treated with 1% urea had a beneficial effect on the daily body gain and improved the reproductive performance and subsequent fertility of Saidi rams, compared to wheat straw.",

Pregnancy was verified using the early pregnancy factor (EPF) activity on Day 4 after artificial insemination (AI). Pregnant cows were randomly allotted to two groups: treated (n = 8) and control (n = 8). Oxytocin (100 IU, 5 ml, DIF Turkey) was administered twice daily by intravenous injections to treated cows and sterile saline (5 ml) to control cows immediately before milking on days 4 to 7 after AI. Blood samples were taken via jugular vein every day from day 4 to 8 and every other day until Day 20 following insemination to evaluate the effect of oxytocin on embryonic survival. The embryonic loss was diagnosed in 3 of the 8 cows treated with oxytocin, and embryonic survival rate was 62.5% in this group versus 87.5% in controls. Short cycles occurred in 37.5% of oxytocin-treated cows. At the same time their serum progesterone concentrations rose more slowly than in controls. It was concluded that cows administered oxytocin on days 4 to 7 after insemination are at a higher risk of pregnancy loss.",

The MHV-76 genome lacks at least 12 ORFs at the 5'-end including the M1, M2, M3 and M4 genes and the eight viral t-RNA-like genes. During 27 months of experimental infection of BALB/c mice we followed their pathogenesis, immunology and oncogenic properties. After intranasal infection with MHV-76, the infectious virus was detected in the blood, thymus, lungs, heart, liver, spleen, bone marrow, peritoneal macrophages, lymph nodes, kidneys, mammary glands, brain and small intestine. The acute phase of infection was attenuated, but the chronic phase of infection was accompanied with long persistence of virus not only in the lymphatic, but in the neural and glandular tissue, as well. In comparison with the prototype strain, splenomegaly and lymphocytosis was very low. Surprisingly, during 27 months the BALB/c mice infected with MHV-76 did not develop lymphoproliferative disorders like infectious mononucleosis, leukaemia or lymphomas. We hypothesize that the M4 gene, present in all oncogenic MHV isolates, might be related (directly or indirectly) to their transforming properties.",

In this study, tumour suppressive effects of a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) etoricoxib in the prevention of N-methyl-Nnitrosourea (NMU)-induced mammary carcinogenesis in Sprague-Dawley rats were evaluated. Etoricoxib was administered in the diet, at two concentrations: 1) 0.01 mg/g (ETO 0.001%) and 2) 0.025 mg/g (ETO 0.0025%). Although the chemopreventive effects were not statistically significant, remarkable tumour suppressive effects with the concentration of ETO 0.0025% were recorded. The incidence decreased by 4.31% and tumour frequency per group decreased by 6.67% when compared to the control group. Latency (the period from carcinogen administration to the first tumour appearance) increased by 7.28% in dose-dependent manner. The results of our experiments point to dose-dependent tumour suppressive effects of a higher concentration of etoricoxib (ETO 0.0025%) when compared to the control group. They suggest that higher etoricoxib concentrations may enhance its tumour suppressive effects.",

Immunohistochemical, light and electron microscopic procedures were employed. Stereological methods were used for estimation of cellular and nuclear volumes. hits on epithelial cells, tubular lumens, and endocrine progenitor cells were counted by systematic field sampling using test grid. Number of mitoses was registered in various cellular types after colchicine treatment. Data obtained were converted to 1 mm 3 tissue. First granules were observed in cells on day 10 and 18 hours, however two different granular types are distinguishable by electron microscopy only on day 15, when insulin and glucagon can be detected immunohistochemically. Cellular volume increased remarkably in harmony with findings of granules in serous cells. Number of epithelial cells increased also exponentially. The increase was more rapid between days 13 and 15, later it appeared exponential. Value of mitotic index and length of cell cycle did not change considerably between days 15 and 24. Mitoses were observed in ductal, exocrine, as well as endocrine cells. The dividing endocrine cells were those that contained fine dense granules (progenitor cells). The sub-population of progenitor cells is able to divide, however, this source of cells appears insufficient for exponential growth. Results after colchicine treatment show the increase of cell population but the life-span and a period necessary for volume multiplication vary. Mitoses decrease in both sub-populations during the prenatal period. The progenitor cells arise probably by differentiation from the ducts, because their number increases proportionally to the main cell population.",

    "abstract": "This study was performed to investigate the effects of alfuzosin, doxazosin and tamsulosin in vitro on trigone smooth muscle of rabbit. In this study, fifteen rabbits weighing 2.5 - 3 kg were used. One strip in the shape of a trigone was prepared for each of the isolated bladders. Firstly, an initial tension of 1 g was placed on each segment, and we waited for equilibration by constantly bubbling with 95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 . Next, the determination level of electrical stimulation which created submaximal contraction and effective dosage were found for trigone and they were determined by applying different concentrations of phenylephrine (10 -8 M, 10 -7 M, 10 -6 M, 10 -5 M), respectively. Firstly 10 -8 M dosage of alfuzosin (10 -8 M, 10 -7 M, 10 -6 M, 10 -5 M) was added, then we waited for 20 min. Then, an effective dosage of phenylephrine (10 -5 M) was added into the solution and we waited for 7 min again. After this process, electrical stimulation was applied for the contraction of the tissue. After stimulation, the tissue was washed twice every two minutes and rested; we waited until the tissue reached its starting stretching value. The same processes were performed for the other dosages of alfuzosin (10 -7 M, 10 -6 M, 10 -5 M), doxazosin (10 -7 M, 10 -6 M, 10 -5 M) and tamsulosin (10 -7 M, 10 -6 M, 10 -5 M), respectively. In conclusion, when we compared the amplitudes of the responses of all concentrations of doxazosin, alfuzosin and tamsulosin in the trigone smooth muscle with amplitude of a response of effective concentration of phenylephrine, it was determined that the prevention level of contractions occurred after tamsulosin hydrochloride was higher than after alfuzosin hydrochloride and doxazosin mesylate. With these results, we showed that alfuzosin, doxazosin and tamsulosin inhibited noradrenalin-based contractions in the rabbit trigone smooth muscle and this result can be used both for in vitro and in vivo future studies.",

The ferrets were immunized with a live attenuated vaccine. The vaccination pattern was as follows: primary vaccination at the age of 6 weeks, fi rst revaccination at 30 days after primary vaccination, and second revaccination after another 30 days. Blood samples were taken prior to primary vaccination and then at 30-day intervals (sampling 1 to 12). The whole experimental cycle covered the period of one year from primary vaccination (till the age of 1 year and 6 weeks). Serum samples were analysed for anti-CDV virus-neutralisation antibodies using a virus-neutralisation test using the Onderstepoort CDV strain. All ferrets had zero virus-neutralisation antibody titres before primary vaccination. Two ferrets produced virus-neutralisation antibodies as a response to first revaccination. A stable antibody level (titre 256) was maintained between months 4 and 11 after primary vaccination and a sudden increase in antibody titre (titres 512 and 1024 - 2048) occurred in both animals in months 11 and 12. The reason for the abrupt rise in antibody titres in the two animals remains unclear. No anti-CDV seroconversion was observed in the three remaining animals. Regarding the results obtained in this study we do not consider commonly recommended vaccination with a live attenuated anti-CDV vaccine as an effective method of antibodies induction against distemper in young ferrets.",

    "abstract": "The repeated administration of various drugs of abuse may lead to a gradually increased behavioural response to these substances, particularly an increase in locomotion and stereotypies may occur. This phenomenon is well known and described as behavioural sensitisation. An increased response to the drug tested, elicited by previous repeated administration of another drug is recognised as cross-sensitisation. Based on our earlier experiences with studies on mice, which confirmed sensitisation to methamphetamine and described cross-sensitisation to methamphetamine after pre-treatment with cannabinoid CB 1 receptor agonist, we focused the present study on the use of another typical laboratory animal - the rat. A biological validity of the sensitisation phenomenon was expected to be enhanced if the results of both mouse and rat studies were conformable. Similar investigation in rats brought very similar results to those described earlier in mice. However, at least some interspecies differences were noted in the rat susceptibility to the development of sensitisation to methamphetamine effects. Comparing to mice, it was more demanding to titrate a dose of methamphetamine producing behavioural sensitisation. Furthermore, we were not able to provoke cross-sensitisation by repeated administration of cannabinoid CB 1 receptor agonist methanandamide and similarly, we did not demonstrate the suppression of cross-sensitisation in rats that were repeatedly given combined pre-treatment with cannabinoid CB 1 receptor antagonist AM 251 and methamphetamine. Finally, unlike mice, an alternative behavioural change was registered after repeated methamphetamine treatment instead: the occurrence of stereotypic behaviour (nose rubbing).",

A total of 161 sexed broiler chickens of Ross 308 type were included in the experimental study. The group of cocks (LNM) and hens (LNF) fed a diet containing 10% untreated lupin meal reached a higher mean weight in comparison with the groups consuming a diet with the content of 10% meal treated by heat (LTM and LTF). The cocks in the LNM group reached a higher live weight (2 680.26 g) on day 42 compared with the cocks in the LTM group (2 591.28 g). A significantly higher weight ( p ≤ 0.01) was proven in the hens in the LNF group (2 357.25 g) compared with the hens in the LTF group (2 241.22 g) on day 42. Blood was taken from vena basilica on day 42 in order to perform haematological and biochemical tests. In the native blood, the total numbers of erythrocytes (Er), the haematocrit value (Hc), haemoglobin (Hb), the mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean erythrocyte volume (MCV) and total leukocytes volume (Le) were determined. The assessed biochemical indicators in blood plasma included the total protein concentration (TP), glucose (Glu), cholesterol (Chol), catalytic concentration of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), plasmatic calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P) and magnesium (Mg). The results of haematological and biochemical tests ranged within physiological values. Some differences cannot be associated with the diets tested. The study results suggest the possibility of better utilization of thermally untreated lupin meal (compared with thermally treated lupin meal) for the nutrition of broiler chickens. The results achieved suggest both positive and economic effect (no costs for thermal treatment) in the case of no necessity of thermal treatment of lupin meal, when compared e.g. with soy meal, from the point of view of inactivation of anti-nutritional factors.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to estimate the effect of rapeseed pomace and extruded full-fat soya in the diets of dairy cows on changes in the milk fatty acid (FA) profile. The experiment was carried out on 30 dairy cows and divided into two periods: the indoor feeding period and the grazing period. Control diet cows were fed the farm’s total mixed ration (TMR); cows of experimental group 1 (ES) cows were fed the farm’s TMR supplemented with extruded full-fat soya; cows of experimental group 2 (RP) were fed the farm’s TMR supplemented with rapeseed pomace. The total content of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) tended to be lower in the RP and ES groups than in the control group during both feeding periods. Our results suggest that supplementing diets with rapeseed and soybean products are both effective in improving the fatty acid proportion of desirable (hypocholesterolaemic) FAs, mainly oleic acid (18:1n-9), linoleic acid (18:2n-6) and conjugated linoleic acid (CLAcis9trans11). The study showed that during the indoor feeding period, the unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) contents were significantly higher in the ES group compared to the control group ( P &lt; 0.05). The nutritional value of milk from the feeding groups in which rations were supplemented with ES or RP was better due to a quartile reduction of the atherogenicity index (AI) and the significantly increased spreadability index (SI) of the butter manufactured during the indoor feeding period ( P &lt; 0.01).",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the antioxidant and hepatoprotective effects of Celtis tournefortii fruit extract (Ct) against copper-induced liver damage in rats. Thirty-two Wistar Albino rats were divided into four equal groups (n = 8): Control, Copper (Cu), Copper + C. tournefortii (Cu+Ct), and C. tournefortii (Ct). Superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase (CAT) activities, glutathione (GSH) concentration, malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant status (TAS) and total oxidant status (TOS) were analysed in the liver tissues. Liver histopathology was also evaluated. Alanine aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase significantly decreased in the Cu+Ct group compared with the Cu group. Oxidative stress parameters MDA and TOS significantly increased with copper administration, whereas they decreased with C. tournefortii co-treatment compared to Cu group. GSH concentration and TAS showed significant decreases with copper administration. Celtis tournefortii co-supplementation with copper significantly enhanced antioxidant parameters such as TAS, SOD, and GPx. Celtis tournefortii remarkably attenuated degenerative and necrotic changes caused by the oral exposure of copper in the liver tissue of rats. Celtis tournefortii may provide amelioration of the antioxidant status and moderation of severity of liver damage against copper toxicity. The therapeutic use of C. tournefortii may exhibit protective effects in liver injury treatment.",

    "abstract": "The wide use of cell technologies in clinical practice requires a large amount of cell material, which has led to improvement in culture conditions, making it possible to obtain more cell material in a shorter period of time. Thus, the purpose of our paper was to study the effects of different concentrations of an insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), a fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2),| a growth hormone (rhGH), and Biolaminin 521 LN (LN 521) on the proliferative activity and genetic stability of stem cell cultures derived from the cat bone marrow, adipose tissue, and myocardium. Cell cultures for the experiment were obtained from the adipose tissue, bone marrow, and myocardium of a cat. Differences were found in the effects of the various growth promoters on the proliferative activity of cells in the culture. The IGF-1 demonstrated a positive effect on the proliferative activity of all cultures. The addition of the rhGH to the bone marrow-derived cell culture increased the size of the cells and decreased the proliferation index relative to the control group. The addition of the growth factors to the culture medium did not significantly increase the number of cells with altered karyotype in any of the cultures relative to the control group.",

Dopamine beta-hydroxylase, an enzyme catalysing the conversion of dopamine into norepinephrine in synaptic endings, significantly affects the modulation of emotional states and behaviour. The aim of this study was to determine the association of C789A polymorphism in the canine dopamine beta-hydroxylase gene ( DBH ) and aggressive behaviour in dogs. A total of 110 dogs of different breeds were analysed. All animals were classified according to their individual behavioural characteristics, defined by a veterinary interview and observation. Polymorphism was analysed using ACRS-PCR (amplification created restriction site-polymerase chain reaction) method. Significant differences in DBH genotypes and allele frequency between aggressive and non-aggressive dogs were observed (χ 2 = 16,232, P = 0.0003). In aggressive dogs, the CC genotype (0.788) and C allele (0.815) were most frequent while in non-aggressive dogs, their frequencies were significantly lower (0.361 and 0.404, respectively). The obtained results indicate that DBH is a promising candidate gene for canine behavioural study.",

In this one-year survey, we present the results of monthly microbiological testing of milk from vending machines in Croatia for S. aureus and its multi-drug resistance. Staphylococcus aureus was detected in 27.58% of the samples. Among 60 tested isolates from 10 farmers, a total of 41 isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent (68.33%). A Multiple Antibiotic Resistance (MAR) index of 0.2 or higher had 48.8% of the resistant isolates, which is considered a high-risk potential for the spread of antimicrobial resistance. The majority of the isolates were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin followed by ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, and kanamycin. The results impose the need for improving the control measures in the raw milk distribution chain focused on MAR risk reduction.",

The epidemiological study indicates that PCV2 infections associated with PMWS disease are only sporadically present in the Czech Republic. Subsequently used real time PCR technique confirmed the relation between PMWS status at the individual pig level and PCV2 DNA concentration. PCV2 DNA load in lymph nodes of PMWS-affected pigs were about 3 logs higher than the levels detected in the PMWS-nonaffected group ( P &lt; 0.05). Other parallel viral infections (PRRSV, PPV) were detected by real time PCR techniques in 21 out of 39 PCV2 infected pigs (54%). The results of serological examination of blood samples collected during the necropsy of 100 pigs are suggestive of great prevalence of PCV2 infections in pig herds; nevertheless serum samples collected from individual pigs at a single point in time had a low diagnostic value.",

Samples (n = 42) were scanned in FT-NIR Analyzer and simultaneously analyzed by standard methods. The spectra were measured in the reflectance mode with a compressive cell between 10 000 and 4 000 cm -1 , averaging 100 scans. Calibration models were developed using the partial least squares (PLS) method. These calibration models were checked later by crossvalidation. The following statistical values were obtained: R (correlation coefficient) = 0.997 and SEC (standard error of calibration) = 0.002 for water activity, R = 0.966 and SEC = 0.023 for pH, R = 0.995 and SEC = 0.970 for dry matter content, R = 0.995 and SEC = 0.045 for salt content, R = 0.965 and SEC = 0.652 for non collagen muscle protein, R = 0.996 and SEC = 0.559 for fat content. The results of the study showed that FT-NIR is a suitable method for rapid analysis of physical and chemical properties of sausages.",

The experiments were aimed on the influence of two polysaccharides isolated from the gel (A, HF1-Z) and one from the epidermis (SL-1) of Aloe vera leaves, characterized by chemical composition and structural properties, on the cough reflex. The method of mechanically induced cough was used in conscious cats. A nylon fibre directed individually into the mucous area of the laryngopharyngeal and tracheobronchial airways via endotracheal cannula elicited the cough reflex. Statistical evaluation registered cough reflex indicators (number of cough efforts - NE, cough frequency - NE min –1 intensity of cough attacks during expiration and inspiration - IA + and IA - , intensity of maximal inspiratory and expiratory cough efforts - IME - and IME + ) showed that gel polysaccharide HF1-Z possessed higher cough-suppressing activity than dropropizine, a nonnarcotic peripheral cough suppressant. Their antitussive activity was accompanied mainly with a decrease of NE, IA + and IA - from both laryngopharyngeal and tracheobronchial mucous areas of the airways. Results of the presented study also showed minimal influence of polysaccharide HF1-Z on expectoration predictor, IME - and IME + . New pharmacodynamic property of polysaccharides isolated from Aloe vera was shown during experiments, which could be a base of their possible therapeutic use in this indication in future.",

The aim of this study was to determine for the first time the presence of gelatinases and metalloproteases in boar seminal plasma and to correlate the results with semen indicators. Gelatin zymography was used for simultaneous identification and measurement of gelatinase enzyme activity associated with their molecular weights. Several gelatinase forms were identified in seminal plasma of boars. Those that were stimulated by CaCl 2 and inhibited by EDTA and phenanthroline were considered as metalloproteases. Negative correlation between semen indicators (sperm index, sperm concentration and concentration of progressive motile sperm) and the concentrations of metalloprotease at 78 kDa and 66 kDa means that higher values of semen indicators correlate with lower concentrations of these metaloproteases in seminal plasma. Gelatinases with molecular weight of 225, 78 and 66 kDa correlated with higher levels of acrosome damage. Samples with sperm index above 110 M/ml contained gelatinases of significantly lower band intensities at 78 and 66 kDa compared to samples with SI less than 110 M/ml. Bands with 225, 78 and 66 kDa are suggested to belong to a dimer of MMP-9, proMMP-2 and mature MMP-2.",

The studied indicators were collected at rest, immediately after the exercise and 30 min after the exercise. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed a significant effect of different workloads on blood lactate concentration, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. No significant difference was found in IOP reduction when comparing aerobic and moderate anaerobic exercise. Our results confirm that the lack of a significant change in IOP in the athletic horse after mild exercise is in accordance with the human athlete.

Occasional implant failure was evaluated based on radiographic examination of femurs of animals 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks after surgery. When bone defect was stabilized using 3.5 mm LCP, in 6 cases (66.7%) the screw was broken/lost in the proximal fragment of the femur 2 weeks after implantation (n = 4) and 4 weeks after implantation (n = 2). In 4 cases of these, the implant failure was accompanied also by loosening of the screw in position 3 in the proximal fragment of the femur. During ostectomy stabilization with 4.5 mm LCP, in 3 cases (7.5%) LCP was broken at the place of the empty central plate hole (without inserted screw) at the level of the segmental bone defect. Compared to the six-hole 3.5 mm LCP, the five-hole titanium 4.5 mm LCP is more suitable implant for flexible bridging osteosynthesis of a critically sized segmental defect of femoral diaphysis in the miniature pig. The results of this study will allow reducing implant failures in time- and cost-demanding transplantation experiments focused on bone healing.",

Ewes were aged 3 to 5 years and were bred in a closed pen. They were fed alfalfa hay, pasture grass, concentrate and corn silage. Each lactating ewe was nursing a single lamb. Five ml of blood from v. jugularis, 50 ml milk and 200 g feed mixture were collected at 15 day intervals up to 135 days (9 samples). Serum glucose and urea concentrations were evaluated using a spectrophotometer, milk lactose in Polarimeter, gross energy by calculation method and crude protein by Kjeldahl methods. The mean values for dietary GE, CP, SG, SU, MU and ML were 2.39 Mcal/kg/DM, 14.1% food/DM, 2.69, 4.65, 3.67 mmol/l and 4.8 mg/dl milk, respectively. Significant differences ( P &lt; 0.01) were found for serum and milk indicators during the milking periods among the sampling times. Serum urea and milk urea irregularly increased while serum glucose and milk lactose irregularly decreased. Positive correlations were found ( P &lt; 0.05) between SU/MU (r = 0.45), MU/GE (r = 0.75), MU/CP (r = 0.70) and SU/CP (r = 0.97).

It consists in balancing the fluctuation of cerebrospinal fluid by applying appropriate holds that make it possible for the patientŐs organism to release tensions which have formed in tissues. The aim of the present work was to depict the possibility to adapt the method of craniosacral therapy used in humans to the therapy of horses. Thirteen therapeutic holds proposed for the treatment of horses were described and interpreted graphically on the basis of therapy of 62 horses with different disorders. A total of 241 craniosacral therapy treatments were performed. The adaptation of presented craniosacral therapy holds to equine therapy was developed by the first author on the basis of relevant holds used in the biodynamic craniosacral therapy in humans and in own therapeutic practice. The effects of own practice and data available in literature suggest that craniosacral therapy seems to be an effective method of improving the state of health of horses suffering from different complaints that may cause major difficulties in sport, breeding or private use of the animals. The use of thermography made it possible to record the effects of therapy and some processes accompanying it, which had been impossible before.",

    "abstract": "In April 2015, a farmer in the Silesia Region, Czech Republic, suffered a massive loss of 51 sheep. Two days before the incident, the flock of approximately 300 sheep were transferred from their wintering stable to pastureland. The pasture had a brook as a source of drinking water and in addition, a water cistern with drinking water was provided as well as mineral salt licks; otherwise the animals were left to graze with no supplementary feed. During the night of 28/29 April it rained heavily. The salt blocks were damaged and softened, showing signs of intensive nibbling. In the morning of 29 April, dead animals were found all over the pastureland. Four of the sheep were sent for post mortem examination and toxicological analyses. Evidence of extremely high concentrations of NaCl in the liver samples and characteristic pathologicalanatomical findings confirmed the suspicion that the sheep had died of fodder salt poisoning. The rapid and extreme change in the weather conditions, soaking of the otherwise solid salt lick, and the short period of acclimatisation of the sheep to the pasture were at fault. The main preventative measure is to respect the transitory period for the animals to get accustomed to a different kind of roughage and local conditions. This case is noteworthy because of the number of animals affected, the speed of the poisoning progress, and the detailed pathological examination of the dead animals. As there is a limited number of articles describing salt poisoning in sheep, this case study may contribute to the broadening of the knowledge on this issue.",

As far as dependence of colour on the flour/addition ratio is concerned, significant differences ( P &lt; 0.05) were found for the following combinations: mixture of wheat flour with buckwheat, barley, and oat; mixture of spelt flour with buckwheat and oat; and mixture of rye flour with buckwheat and barley. The proposed general regression model which was created using the data obtained in the experiment, showed colour variability of more than 95 per cent.",

    "abstract": "Colostrum is currently used as a food supplement. It has been sought after by an increasing number of consumers for its unique composition. Its use is supported by EU legislation that defines colostrum as an animal product for human consumption. Therefore, information on its chemical properties and the content of lipophilic vitamins are important when evaluating colostrum quality and safety. The aim of this study was to assess the dynamic changes of basic chemical properties (protein, fat, lactose, and dry matter) and the content of selected lipophilic vitamins (vitamin A and vitamin E) in white short-haired goat’s colostrum. Attention was paid to the first milk from the first hour to the sixth day after parturition as the initial milk composition changes rapidly during this period. Protein, fat, and lactose concentrations were measured by near infrared spectroscopy, vitamins were analysed simultaneously by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with detection in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. The most significant changes in chemical indicators occurred during the first three days ( P ≤ 0.01) post partum . The highest decrease was observed in protein concentrations. It was × 2 lower than in the first hour post partum . The concentration of vitamin A rapidly decreased during 36 h. In the following hours, gradual changes were observed ( P &gt; 0.05). The analysed components in caprine colostrum were similar to mature milk after 132 h post partum .",

Cats were randomly assigned into the anaesthesia group (group A) or to the surgery group (group S). The tiletamine-zolazepam-xylazine-tramadol combination was administered with an intended dose of 2.4 mg·kg -1 tiletamine-zolazepam (TZ), 0.36 mg·kg -1 xylazine (X), and 0.8 mg·kg -1 tramadol (T) into the lateral femoral muscle. Physiological indicators including rectal temperature (RT), heart rate (HR), respiration rate (RR), haemoglobin saturation by oxygen (SpO 2 ), mean arterial pressure (MAP), systolic arterial pressure (SAP), and diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) were collected after baseline values (time 0). Cats were immediately given the intramuscular injection drug combination. Physiological indicators were recorded before injection of this combination and at time 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100, and 120 min after administration of the tiletamine-zolazepam-xylazine-tramadol combination. In group S, castrations were performed using a closed procedure. Vomiting, excitement, apnoea, and abnormal behaviour were not observed in any cat during anaesthesia. All changes in indicators were within cardiorespiratory acceptable limits in both groups. The tiletamine-zolazepam-xylazine-tramadol combination produced satisfactory anaesthesia in cats and it will be useful not only in induction of anaesthesia but also for surgery of short duration.",

We describe a technique for laparoscopic cystostomy (LC group; n = 7) in Bama miniature pigs and compare the surgical stress induced by this procedure to open cystostomy (OC group; n = 7). A three-portal approach was used for laparoscopic cystostomy. First, we placed 2 simple interrupted sutures between the ventral body wall and urinary bladder. Then, a purse-string suture was placed in the urinary bladder wall, approximately 1 cm cranially to the two sutures. A stab incision was made at the center of the purse-string suture and a 12-F Foley catheter advanced into the urinary bladder; the suture was then pulled tightly and tied. Again, two interrupted sutures were placed 1 cm cranially to the catheter, between the ventral body wall and the bladder, to establish cystopexy. The extracorporeal portion of the catheter was fixed to the skin by a finger-trap suture. Blood samples were collected to measure the white blood cell count and serum concentrations of cortisol, interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein; follow-up laparoscopy was performed 1 month after the surgery. Laparoscopic cystotomy was successfully performed in all the pigs; the mean operating time was 43 ± 5 min. The levels of the stress markers reflected a lower stress response for LC than OC. Thus, LC appears to be better than OC both in terms of technique and physiological responses elicited, and may be more suitable than OC in the creation of experimental animal models for investigations on urinary diseases and those requiring diversion of urine flow.",

Due to its oestrogenic effects, feeds contaminated with zearalenone can cause striking negative effects on reproduction primarily in pigs. The aim of the study was to test the efficiency of a feed additive developed for enzymatic decomposition of mycotoxins. A total of sixty 6-week-old conventional Dutch Landrace × Hungarian Large White F 1 female pigs weaned at 30 ± 2 days of age were divided into 6 groups of 10 animals. Between 50 and 70 days of age, 4 groups of pigs (experimental) were treated with zearalenone (8 or 16 mg/pig dose) administered every other day via an oesophageal tube; pigs from the other two groups were not treated with zearalenone and served as controls. Throughout the experiment, the diet of two experimental groups and one control group was supplemented with a feed additive (named: Detoxa Plus) at a concentration of 1 kg/tonne; pigs from the other control group received neither zearalenone treatment, nor the feed additive. Pigs’ live weight, weight of ovaries and uterus, histological characteristics of the ovaries, uterus, vagina, spleen and lymph nodes, liver concentrations of zearalenone and its metabolites (α- and β-zearalenol) were studied. This study showed the preventive capacity of the feed additive against zearalenone. Positive effects included the prevention of uterine enlargement, beneficial effects on the histopathological scores of ovaries, uterus and vagina and reduced concentration of zearalenone and metabolites in the liver. This study demonstrates for the first time that due to its enzymatic activity Detoxa Plus renders zearalenone contaminated feeds less toxic.",

Freshness of meat is connected with the concentration of biogenic amines which is related to meat spoilage. The aim of this study was to assess changes in concentration of biogenic amines in raw meat of wild boar (n = 20, mean age 1–2 years) during storage at different temperatures. Carcases of wild boars hunted in winter 2012 in hunting districts of south Moravia were stored unskinned during 21 days at various temperatures (0, 7 and 15 °C). Concentrations of biogenic amines (putrescine, cadaverine, tyramine, tryptamine, phenylethylamine, histamine, spermine and spermidine) were determined in the shoulder and leg muscles by high-performance liquid chromatography in combination with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. Good hygienic quality was maintained when wild boar carcasses were stored for a maximum of 14 days at 0 °C (content of biogenic amines in 3 meat samples exceed the limit of 5 mg/kg on day 21 of storage) or a maximum of 7 days at 7 °C (content of biogenic amines in 4 meat samples exceed the limit of 5 mg/kg on day 14 of storage). The temperature of 15 °C should be considered as unsuitable storage temperature if good hygienic quality of game meat during storage is to be guaranteed (content of biogenic amines in 2 meat samples exceed the limit of 5 mg/kg already on day 7 of storage). The study brings new information about the biogenic amine content and its changes in wild boar meat during the storage period of 21 days.",

It gives information about normal functioning of the peripheral nerves. The aim of this study was to evaluate the applicability of a new electroneurographic technique by performing motor nerve conduction velocity measurements in the ulnar nerve with surface stimulating electrodes in healthy dogs, to correlate the obtained data by age, limb length, rectal temperature, and sex; and to compare these results with published findings utilizing needle stimulating electrodes. The study was performed in 24 clinically healthy dogs without anaesthesia. Rectal temperatures and limb lengths were measured in all individuals. There were significant correlations among several indicators (age, rectal temperature, limb length, conduction velocity, latency and duration of compound muscle action potentials). Limb length was found to have a significant effect on the duration of the compound muscle action potential from both stimulation sites (proximal/distal; r = 0.71, r = 0.68, P &lt; 0.01), but there was no effect on the conduction velocity or amplitude of the action potentials. There was no significant difference ( P &gt; 0.05) in the measured indicators between males and females, even though females had a higher mean conduction velocity than males. These results prove that conduction velocity measurements in dogs could be performed non-invasively, without a danger of infection or haematomas or complications with anaesthesia, which is more favourable and time-saving for clinical practice, and more comfortable for patients.",

    "abstract": "Changes in the composition of colostrum in the peripartum period focused on the neonate’s immunity can minimize the response of the mammary gland before natural exposure to mastitis pathogens. This research evaluated the oxidative activity of mononuclear and polymorphonuclear phagocytes of bovine colostrum. Bacteriologically negative (n = 171) bovine colostrum samples of first and second milking postpartum were evaluated. The oxidative activity was assessed by the production of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) released either spontaneously or upon stimulation by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). For this, three treatments were used: control (C) – only cells; non-opsonized (NO) - cells and ETEC non-opsonized; and opsonized (O) – cells and ETEC opsonized. Median values of concentrations (nmol/10 6 ) of H 2 O 2 produced by cells obtained from the first and second milking treatments C, NO and O were 149.1 and 39.9 ( P = 0.0007); 125.5 and 49.1 ( P = 0.0007); 102.4 and 54.4 ( P = 0.008), respectively. No differences were observed between the treatments at each milking. The amount of H 2 O 2 produced at first milking exceeded the values found thereafter. Furthermore, the presence of bacteria did not determine the increased amount of H 2 O 2 released by phagocytes. Thus, we concluded that the mammary gland’s events during the peripartum period have an effect on the proportion and activity of phagocytes, which can cause injuries to the breast parenchyma by the large amount of free radicals produced. The high frequency of bovine mastitis during this period indicates the need for studies of the immunity of the mammary gland and research of susceptibility factors for bacterial infections.",

The study involved a population of 163 Montbeliarde cows. In view of the substantial role of the IGF-I/IGF-IR system in growth and development, the aim of this study was to show an association between insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor gene polymorphisms in Montbeliarde cows and birth weight of their offspring. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms within the IGF1R gene were analyzed using PCR-RFLP or ACRS-PCR methods. The frequencies of the most common genotypes were as follows: CC 0.90 ( IGF1R / Tai I), GG 0.77 ( IGF1R / Msp I) and GG 0.58 ( IGF1R / Taq I). A total of 14 combinations was compared, from which due to the low frequency (n &lt; 10) only 4 were used for calculations. In the analysed herd, the mean body weight of calves regardless of the calving order was always the highest in animals with maternal CC / GG / AA combined genotype. This observation was confirmed statistically both for the individual genotypes as well as in the case of cows carrying such a combination at the same time ( P &lt; 0.01). Therefore, IGF1R may be considered as a promising candidate gene for the identification of molecular markers predicting meat quality in cattle.",

Thoroughbred mares of English, Arabic and Akhal-Teke breeds owned by horse ranches of the Republic of Kazakhstan were used in the research. Vasectomy techniques were mastered on a slaughtering material, and then field tested on stallions. A series of experiments were set for comparative evaluation of various methods of preparation and use of a vasectomized stallion, resulting in a technique based on removing the front section of sperm ducts in the ventro-caudal portion of the scrotum. The developed method is convenient, safe, and easy to perform in field conditions. The surgery is not time consuming, and there are no postoperative complications. We found a positive effect of the vasectomized stallion on the course of the mares’ oestrous cycles, on their performance during hippodrome testing, and their reproductive function. The method reduced the standing heat period, and the mares quickly recovered their performance. Thus, it decreased the time of the mares’ elimination from the training schedule and had a positive effect on the performance during hippodrome testing. The use of a vasectomized stallion during training significantly predetermined the course of the mares’ reproductive cycle after completion of the hippodrome testing. The results of this study are relevant to the practical needs of sport horse breeding.",

    "abstract": "The work is focused on the evaluation of seasonal dynamics of the total count of microorganisms in sheep’s milk and on the proposal of developing cut-off values for standard limitation for the next fifteen years for hygienic safety support. The total count of microorganisms was measured between years 2012–2014 (n = 4,746). The results were statistically evaluated using medians, geometric means, arithmetic means, means of log values (log 10 ) and standard deviations for the cut-off limit determination. This model was patterned on the maximum of total count of microorganisms in the tested percentiles 95 (statistical conventional interval), 91, 90, 80 and 70% and on the result of medians (from 109 to 148 × 10 3 cfu/ml). These cut-off limits were divided into three classes (I to III) of standard quality, and the model of dynamics for their gradual implementation time was created as follows: initiation period (class I = ≤ 800; II = from 801 to 1,300; III = 1,301 to 4,000; non-standard = &gt; 4,000 × 10 3 cfu/ml); second period (class I = ≤ 550; II = 551 to 800; III = 801 to 1,300; non-standard = &gt; 1,300 × 10 3 cfu/ml); third period (standard class = ≤ 800 × 10 3 cfu/ml); fourth period (standard class = ≤ 550 × 10 3 cfu/ml); and the last legislative period (≤ 300 × 10 3 cfu/ml as a real hygienic limit). The limit for milk without heat treatment corresponds to the real value of the median 200 × 10 3 cfu/ml. The work is important for the procedures in the development of methods for the control and safety of raw food material.",

    "abstract": "Oxalic acid is one of the organic acids used for controlling Varroa destructor , a mite parasitizing the honey bee ( Apis mellifera ). The aim of this work was to examine the effect of oxalic acid applied by sublimation on honey bee colony fitness, and to compare it with the effect of amitraz, a routinely used synthetic acaricide. Bee colonies of equal strength were randomly divided into two groups. In December 2014, one group was treated with amitraz in the form of aerosol, and the second group was treated with oxalic acid applied by sublimation. The colonies were monitored over winter. Dead bees found at the bottom of the hive were counted regularly and examined microscopically for infection with Nosema sp. (Microsporidia). At the end of March 2015, living foragers from each hive were sampled and individually examined for Nosema sp. infection. Colony strength was evaluated at the beginning of April. No adverse effect of oxalic acid on colony strength was observed despite the fact that the total number of dead bees was non-significantly higher in the oxalic acid-treated group. Examination of dead bees for Nosema infection did not reveal significant differences in spore numbers between the experimental groups. There was a substantial difference in living individuals, however, with a significantly higher amount of spores per bee found in the amitraz-treated colonies compared to the oxalic acid-treated colonies. Compared to amitraz, oxalic acid applied by sublimation showed no adverse effects on bee colony fitness or on successful overwintering.",

The slaughter yield, breast muscle weight, percentage share of muscles in total in the carcasses, and fatness in general did not differ between the cockerels and capons within the evaluated strains. The trait that mostly distinguished cockerels from capons of strain N88 was the weight of leg muscles. Similarly, the fat content of carcasses expressed with the weight and percentage share of the skin with subcutaneous fat and abdominal fat did not differ between the evaluated groups of cockerels and capons. However, the weight of the leg muscles varied depending on the origin of cockerels and capons. As for the physiochemical properties of meat as well as its chemical composition, no significant differences were recorded in 18-week-old birds. The only obvious effect of the origin and caponisation was found on varied contents of fat in breast muscles in cockerels of strains N88 and P55, and capons of strain P55.",

    "abstract": "Gibbons of the genus Nomascus have a strong sexual dimorphism and dichromatism. As they mature, both sexes develop sex-specific pelage colour. In combination with physical similarities in the genitalia with both sexes, there are problems with determining the sex of young individuals compared to other genus of gibbons. This is a pilot study applying a multiplex polymerase chain reactions based on a non-invasive method for sex determination of gibbons. The study was conducted on 22 faecal samples from gibbons of the genus Nomascus . The animals were monitored by staff so that the samples were identified correctly and each sample was collected immediately after the defecation. Results confirmed the sex in all adult and juvenile animals with known sex; and 2 females and 5 males in juveniles were determined with unknown sex. The results of direct examination completely corresponded with the PCR results. The PCR reaction with template DNA isolated from faecal material required BSA usage, however, we observed the occurrence of nonspecific fragments. This did not affect the reliability of our results and we confirmed the usability of this method for this genus.",

    "abstract": "Recently, studies have suggested an association between the Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) and the Porcine circovirus-2 (PCV2) in PCV2-associated disease cases. The aim of this study was to verify TTSuVs loads in pig faeces from PCV2-positive animals with and without diarrhea from PCVAD-affected and PCV2-unvaccinated herds. A total of 80 faecal samples were collected individually from nursery and grow-finish pigs with (n = 40) or without (n = 40) diarrhea. The samples were tested for PCV2 and TTSuVs by using DNA binding dye SYBR Green quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Torque teno sus virus k2 (TTSuVk2) load in the faeces was significantly higher in the nursery pigs with diarrhea, and these pigs also exhibited significantly higher PCV2 ( P &lt; 0.01) faecal matter loads compared to the non-diarrheic animals from the same age group. Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) viral loads were the same regardless of age group and disease condition. There were no correlations between PCV2 and TTSuV1 or TTSuVk2 and TTSuV1 viral loads; however, a weak correlation ( r = 0.23, P = 0.03) was found between TTSuVk2 and PCV2 viral loads. In conclusion, TTSuVk2 viral loads were significantly higher in the diarrheic faeces from the nursery pigs. Additionally, the higher loads of PCV2 and TTSuVk2 in the nursery-diarrheic animals revealed that diarrhea might have an important role in the spread of both viruses in herds.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of organically chelated zinc methionine (Zn-Met) supplementation on lactation performance of dairy cattle, i.e. milk yield (MY), milk components, and the somatic cell count (SCC) in early lactation. Eighty multiparous cows received two treatments (n = 40 per group) from 21 days prepartum throughout 14 weeks post partum (p.p.). Treatments consisted of 1) supplemental Zn-Met at the dose of 30 mg Zn/kg dry matter (DM) of the total mixed ration (TMR) for the supplemented (S) group; and 2) basal TMR without supplementation for the control (C) group. Daily MY of Zn supplemented cows 30 days p.p. was in not significantly affected ( P &gt; 0.05) by the treatment. After 60 days, the MY of the S-group was significantly higher (S: 44.70 ± 4.24 kg vs. C: 42.08 ± 4.60 kg, respectively); ( P &lt; 0.05). Ninety days p.p. there was a highly significant difference ( P &lt; 0.005) as well (S: 43.22 ± 4.47 kg vs. C: 39.98 ± 4.80 kg). Supplemented cows also produced significantly more milk fat and milk protein than the control on days 60 and 90 of the trial. There was a significant drop and a decreasing trend during the entire trial in SCC in S-group. Milk quality and udder health were positively affected by the Zn-Met treatment. This finding has an important implication for veterinary practice in an era of antibiotic reduction.",

    "abstract": "The study examined leukocytes and subpopulation of lymphocytes in peripheral blood, lymphoproliferative activity, morphology of intestine including mucus barrier in pheasant ( Phasianus colchicus ) after treatment with flubendazole (Flimabend®) and natural extract from sweet chestnut wood (Farmatan®). A total of 24 six-month-old female pheasants were divided into 4 groups (n = 6). The FL group received flubendazole per os 100 mg/g suspension in 1.43 mg of active substance/kg body weight during 7 days of experiment. The CW group received chestnut wood extract per os at a 0.2% concentration for 6 h per day during 5 days (experimental days from 3 to 7). The FL+CW group received a combination of doses administered in the same way as for the first two groups. The control C group received administration with no active substance. The results in our trial demonstrated a mild inflammatory effect on leukocytes, lymphocytes, heterophils, eosinophils ( P &lt; 0.05), and an increase of CD8+ cells in peripheral blood after administration of flubendazole ( P &lt; 0.05). On the other hand, administration of chestnut wood extract containing tannins revealed an anti-inflammatory effect on immunocompetent cells ( P &lt; 0.05). Enhanced lymphoproliferative activity of T and B lymphocytes was observed in chestnut wood extract groups ( P &lt; 0.001). Increased total jejunal thickness of mucus ( P &lt; 0.001) and increased production of MUC-2 ( P &lt; 0.01) was found in the CW group. Body weight was not different between the trial groups. Results indicate that chestnut wood extract can be administered as a preventive immunomodulatory substance reducing inflammatory process as well as an adjuvant in treatment with anthelmintics in pheasants.",

The aim of this study was to determine and compare values of LC 50 for potassium dichromate during the whole period of embryonic development (i.e., 120 h) and 48 h after hatching of embryos in the common carp ( Cyprinus carpio L.). Fish eggs and embryos were exposed to 5 different concentrations of potassium dichromate (i.e., 372, 409, 450, 495, 545 mg l -1 ) during two experiments. Such characteristics as the cumulative mortality, the start and the end of hatching, the number of deformities, body length, and body mass of surviving individuals were studied during the tests. The highest mortality was found in the hatched embryos. Mortality and frequency of deformities increased with the growing concentration of potassium dichromate. The value of 120 LC 50 for potassium dichromate was 464.91 ± 23.83 mg l -1 and the value of 48 LC 50 was 458.94 ± 4.14 mg l -1 (mean ± SD). No statistically significant difference between values 120 LC 50 a 48 LC 50 was found. This is why reduction of the exposure period to only 48 h after hatching seems a reasonable method to study the control of susceptibility using potassium dichromate in embryonic tests of toxicity.",

The evaluation of humoral response was performed on a basis of agglutinin titre after administered antigen and the cellular immunity index was the delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction. The pheasants were prophylactically vaccinated against Newcastle Disease (ND) on the 1 st , 28 th and 56 th day of life. Moreover, on the 49 th day of life, part of the birds was given in the drinking water a vaccine containing the HEV (Haemorrhagic Enteritis Virus). Fourteen days after the HEV vaccination, the birds were intravenously given 0.5 ml of the 10% SRBC (sheep red blood cells) suspension. Simultaneously with the SRBC administration the delayed hypersensitivity test was performed by intradermal administration of phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). It was shown that in pheasants vaccinated with NDV and additionally with HEV, the specific agglutinin anti-SRBC titre was significantly ( p &lt; 0.05) lower than in birds vaccinated against ND only. It also appeared that, the antibodies resistant to 2-mercaptoethanol were 43% of the total pool of specific anti-SRBC antibodies in the NDV vaccinated birds, whereas in birds vaccinated also with HEV they were 75%. No significant differences were found in the DTH test. Only in the HEV vaccinated pheasants the tendency to increase the wing index value was noted. The results confirm the observations concerning immunosuppressive effects of simultaneous vaccinations. They also indicate that overloading the pheasants with many antigens (ND and HEV vaccination) may weaken the humoral response to administered SRBC.",

Furthermore, these changes were influenced by affecting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system and autonomic nervous system (ANS) to study the mechanisms participating in activity of spectral frequency bands of HRV in rabbits. Ten adult rabbits (Chinchilla) were anaesthetized by ketamine and flunitrazepam. The systemic blood pressure, tidal volume and respiratory rate were measured. HRV was evaluated by microcomputer system VariaPulse TF3E. The R-R intervals were derived from the electrocardiogram signal from subcutaneous needle electrodes. The evaluation of HRV in very low (VLF; 0.01-0.05 Hz), low (LF; 0.05-0.15 Hz) and high frequency bands (HF; 0.15-2.0 Hz) was made and parameters of frequency and time analysis were calculated. The measurements were made in horizontal (supine) position, in orthostasis (the angle of 60 °) and again in supine position before and after enalapril (0.5 mg/kg b.w.), metipranolol (0.2 mg/kg b.w.), and after subsequent bilateral cervical vagotomy. The orthostasis in anaesthetized rabbits is accompanied by depression of respiratory rate reversed only by vagotomy. Furthermore, decrease of systemic blood pressure, unchanged heart rate and increased characteristics of heart rate variability were found, with predominant increase of spectral power in LF and VLF bands. This elevation can be eliminated only by complete blockade of ANS. Although the participation of ANS or RAA system in modification of individual HRV frequency bands is not as specific as in humans, we confirmed the participation of RAA system in determination of the VLF band.",

Eight dogs were included in the study and randomly allocated to two groups of four animals. The first group (F) received oral fexofenadine and the second group (M) received methylprednisolone. Over a period of 6 weeks, we evaluated the CADESI (Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent Severity Index) score and the pruritus score and made measurements of biochemical blood indicators (AP, ALT, AST, urea, creatinine) on three occasions. The study results did not reveal any statistically significant differences compared to baseline in AST, ALT, AP, urea and creatinine values in any of the treated groups and at any of the time points during the treatment ( p &gt; 0.112). The mean CADESI values and the severity of pruritus were reduced by more than 50% in both groups during the treatment course. There were no statistically significant differences between group M and group F. A statistically significant difference compared to the baseline was found in the reduction of the CADESI score in group F in the sixth week of treatment ( p = 0.011). There was also a significant reduction compared to the baseline in the severity of pruritus ingroup M in the third ( p = 0.004) and sixth week of treatment ( p = 0.022). Our results indicate the possible use of fexofenadine in the treatment of atopic dermatitis in dogs, as it was demonstrated safe and effective in comparison with methylprednisolone.",

Eleven lactating cows with clinical signs of mastitis in one udder quarter at least were divided into two groups. Group Awas given an antibiotic alone - cefotaxime (250 mg, intramammary administration, 6 doses in total). Group B was given a lower dose of the same antibiotic (cefotaxime, 100 mg, intramammary administration, 5 doses in total) and a blend of enzymes in one drug form, i.e. both the dose and total number of administrations were lower in this group. Before and after the therapy, milk samples were collected and subjected to microbiological examination, and blood samples were withdrawn to determine fibrinogen and ceruloplasmin as acute phase proteins. Before the beginning of the therapy, common mastitis pathogens were detected in milk of both groups; after the end of the therapy, the test results were negative. Mean plasma concentrations of fibrinogen in Group A increased significantly from 6.0 ± 1.4 to 7.4 ± 1.1 g l -1 , in Group B a non-significant decrease was observed, from 6.5 ± 0.86 g l -1 to 6.4 ± 0.9 g l -1 . However, differences between the groups were significant ( p &lt; 0.05). In Group A, mean plasma ceruloplasmin concentration increased significantly from 0.9 ± 0.2 to 1.3 ± 0.18 μmol l -1 , and in Group B it decreased non-significantly from 0.9 ± 0.36 to 1.1 ± 0.26 μmol l -1 , and the difference between the groups was non-significant. In the present study, a favourable effect of repeated topical application of a mixture of proteolytic enzymes was demonstrated. The enzyme therapy resulted in a decreased therapeutic dose of the antibiotic, and suppressed an increase in the levels of inflammation markers under investigation.",

Total methylation of DNA was determined on the basis of presence of 5-methylcytosine at the inner cytosine of the C-C-G-G sequence by using restriction enzymes, endonuclease Msp I and its isoschisomer Hpa II. It was found that in the liver of control animals, molecular weight distribution of both Msp I and Hpa II digestion products of DNA and the level of DNA methylation were influenced by age mainly between the 3rd and the 7th days of life. At this time, significant difference was found especially in products of cleavage with enzyme Msp I, where an increase in DNA fragments of medium molecular weight (1 - 7 kb) occurred. The changes in the molecular weight distribution of DNA digestion products in the offspring of control rats were accompanied by an increase in the level of total DNA methylation from 29.8% to 67%. In the offspring of irradiated males, the level of DNA methylation was higher in comparison with the offspring of non-irradiated control males, especially on the 3rd day after birth. We suppose that this finding is conjoined with a transgeneration transfer of radiation-induced genome damage.",

Hatching time in individual groups and aberrations in the behaviour of hatched specimens were recorded. Cumulative mortality and the proportion of deformed specimens were determined; materials for histological and cytogenetic screening were simultaneously sampled. Cumulative mortality (28 and 26%, respectively) increased after the application of higher doses (130 and 50 μg l -1 ) of crude cyanobacterial extract ( p ⪬ 0.05). In these groups, hatched embryos showed reduced agility and stayed in clusters and in the group with the highest dose of crude cyanobacterial extract white spots on yolk sacks appeared. Cytogenetic screening revealed both chromatid (gaps) and chromosomal aberrations (rings, dicentrics), percentage of which increased with the increased concentration of microcystins and the higher doses of crude cyanobacterial extract. The highest number of aberrant metaphases was recorded after the application of the highest concentrations of cyanobacterial extract and microcystin ( p ⪬ 0.05). Embryo mortality was affected especially by crude cyanobacterial extract, therefore other toxic elements than microcystins present in the extract were probably involved.",

    "abstract": "Unstable fractures of the thoracic spine in humans represent a serious social and economic issue. They may lead to persistent consequences and chronic disease. The anatomical and biomechanical characteristics of the thoracic spine are different from all the other spinal parts due to its higher mobility. The vertebrae of the chest area are less mobile, conferring a higher degree of rigidity to the spine. To destabilize this relatively rigid system, a considerable force is necessary. The treatment of unstable spinal fractures is solely surgical. The decompression of the spinal canal with reposition and stabilisation of the fracture is indicated urgently. This intervention is performed mostly from the posterior approach in the first phase. However, the anterior spinal column is the structure responsible for the stability of the spine. Therefore, the recent advances in spine surgery focus on this area of expertise. For this reason, we carried out a bio-mechanical study aimed at assessing the effectiveness of two surgical tactics used. The study consisted of comparative experiments performed by computer-aided device on segments of pig cadavers (n = 5). The experiment involved a comparison of segments of the thoracic spine under the following conditions: an anatomically intact segment, a spine segment with an artificially created anterior instability, and a segment with an applied internal fixator. The experiment compared the mechanical characteristics of these segments. The experiment has demonstrated that after application of the internal fixator used for stabilisation of the injured anterior spinal column at defined pre-loading of 200 N, the stability of damaged spinal segment in torsion increased twofold. It was also verified that sufficient stability can be ensured using the Modular Anterior Construct System (MACS TL ) implant for ventral stabilisation of thoracic spine unstable injuries. Endoscopic application of this implant represents an additional advantage of this surgical procedure.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this experimental study was to observe the pathological and genotoxic effects of a systemic fungicide, Benomyl [methyl 1-(butyl carbamoyl)-2 benzimidazole carbamate] in male Japanese quails ( Coturnix japonica ). Benomyl (Benlate® DoPont 50% w/w benomyl) at dose rates of 0, 100, 400 and 1000 mg/kg for 8 consecutive days was administered into crops of quails kept in different groups. A significant decrease ( p &lt; 0.05) in feed intake, body weight and relative weight of testes was observed in benomyl-administered quails in a dose related manner. The size of testes decreased in benomyl treated quails. Microscopically, seminiferous tubules of testes exhibited a decreased number of spermatocytes, necrotic spermatids and syncytial cell formation. The number of quails developing testicular alterations increased in a dose-related pattern. These alterations reversed following a withdrawal of benomyl with the exception of the 1000 mg benomyl group, where these persisted till the end of the experiment (56th day). The mean tail length (μm) of the comets produced by leukocytes in single cell gel electrophoresis of 0, 100 and 400 mg dose level groups were 3.48, 3.24 and 3.29, respectively. The mean tail length of comets of the 1000 mg dose level group was 12.03 μm and significantly higher ( p &lt; 0.01) than in all other groups indicating DNA strand breaks at this dose level. These results suggested gonadotoxic effects of benomyl (Benlate®) and also a possible genotoxic effect at 1000 mg/kg level in Japanese quails.",

    "abstract": "The present study brings current information on providing broilers with the required iodine level by the determination of its content in breast and leg muscles and on the relationship between those concentrations and iodine intake by the human population. The iodine content was assessed by the Sandell-Kolthoff method in 84 samples of broiler breast and leg muscles from seven farms in four districts of the Czech Republic, collected during the period from August to September 2004. Average iodine content in broiler breast and leg muscles was 18.9 ± 6.71 μg I kg -1 and 38.1 ± 19.79 μg I kg -1 , respectively, and coefficient of variation was 35.5% and 52.0%, respectively. Iodine concentration in leg muscles was statistically significantly higher ( P &lt; 0.0001) relative to breast muscles. Iodine level variations in the samples from respective farms were expressed in the levels range of 11.4 to 24.3 μg I kg -1 and 18.3 to 61.2 μg I kg -1 in breast and leg muscles, respectively. The detected variations might have been caused by different iodine saturation of broilers from different herds, manifestation of physiological ability of respective animals to utilize the iodine source, potential effect of goitrogens and environmental conditions. Statistical significance of correlation ( P &lt; 0.05) between average iodine levels in breast and leg muscles was confirmed in respective flocks (r = 0.91). It is necessary to accept the iodine content in broiler meat in the balance of iodine supply in the shopping basket of consumers. Provided that the average annual consumption of poultry meat is 23.9 kg with the iodine content of 18.9 μg kg -1 and 38.1 μg kg -1 in breast and leg muscles, respectively, the annual iodine intake is 452 to 911 μg; that represents 0.8 to 1.7% of the requirement per year, which is 150 μg day -1 for an adult person.",

In the region, blood collections and analyses for selected metabolic variables were performed in 54 animals in different production stages (18 heifers, 18 cows in late pregnancy and 18 calves aged 3 weeks on the average). Three herds were studied. The selenium status was determined both directly by measuring serum selenium (Se) contents and indirectly by measuring glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity in whole blood. The mean serum selenium concentration in all the animals under study (n = 54) was 30.6 μg/l +/- 2.91, and mean GSH-Px activity was 167.01 μkat/l +/- 92.39. In heifers, mean serum selenium concentration was 34.81 μg/l +/- 13.84; mean GSHPx activity was 186.96 μkat/l +/- 112.15. In late pregnancy cows, mean serum selenium concentration was 26.58 μg/l +/- 8.01, mean GSH-Px activity was 94.55 +/- 35.72 μkat/l. In calves, mean serum selenium concentration and GSH-Px activity were 30.41 μg/l +/- 12 and 219.54 μkat/l +/- 64.41, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between the heifers and late pregnancy cows in both variables under study. However, between the late pregnancy cows and the calves, only the difference in GSH-Px activity was significant. The results indicate severe Se deficiency in the animals under study. It means apart from other things that mineral licks used did not provide enough minerals to meet the basic requirements of the animals.",

Clinical, epidemiological, serological and virological examinations were performed for the diagnosis of Teschen disease (porcine enterovirus encephalomyelitis, TE). Swine blood serum samples (n = 1680) were collected on 28 farms (60 samples per farm) of 8 regions in 2003. For virus isolation 29 samples of pathological material were taken from the brains of pigs (2 - 4 months of age) that died suddenly on seven swine farms in five regions. Epidemiological and clinical examination revealed no signs of porcine enterovirus encephalomyelitis on 32 Lithuanian swine farms. PTV-1 was not isolated and identified in the PK-15 cell culture. Antibodies against PTV-1, detected by using VNT, were found on all investigated farms and in all age groups. Negative serum (2.3%, 39 from 1680) samples were found in 15.5% (16 from 103) of 2-4-month-old pigs and in 4.7% (23 from 494) of 4-6-month-old ones. The positive serological and negative epidemiological, clinical and virological results suggest that less virulent or avirulent PTV-1 strains were spread on Lithuanian swine farms.",

The sampling was conducted via collecting lymph fluids from the lymph node internal pouch wall of 100 sheep that were examined for the presence of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis . Molecular identification of the Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis isolates was carried out by establishing the presence of the proline iminopeptidase gene. All isolates were confirmed to be Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis by polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain reaction procedure conducted in this research was observed to be reliable and fast, and could be utilized for confirmation of caseous lymphadenitis in sheep as an optional technique to time-consuming biochemical identification methods.",

A total of 24 outbred, male, Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to (1) ABS, (2) SSD, and (3) control groups. Bilateral burn wounds were created near the caudal border of the scapula. Wounds in each group were treated daily with sponges soaked in ABS solution, 1% SSD cream, or saline, respectively. On days 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28, unhealed wound area was measured and biopsy samples were taken for histopathological examination (except day 0). At the end of day 28, all rats in the ABS and SSD groups had complete coverage of the wounds with granulation tissue and epithelialization, whereas wounds in the control group were not completely epithelialized. On day 7, the mean unhealed wound areas and the mean percentages of wound contraction were not significantly different among the groups. However, the mean percentage of wound contraction in the ABS and SSD groups was significantly higher than in the control group on days 14, 21, and 28. Histopathologically, wound healing was characterized by a decrease in neutrophil counts and an increase in vessel counts. Our results suggest that ABS can be successfully used for burn wound healing besides SSD.",

    "abstract": "The effects of manganese from organic and inorganic sources supplemented to diets of sheep on intestinal mucus production and on selected biochemical and haematological indicators were investigated. The experiment was carried out on 18 sheep of the Improved Valachian breed aged seven months over the period of four months. The animals were divided into three groups of six animals each (group 1 – control, basal diet with 31 mg Mn/kg, group 2 – basal diet + manganese sulphate (MnSO 4 ) with 120 mg Mn/kg, group 3 – basal diet + manganese chelate of glycine hydrate (Mn-Gly) with 120 mg Mn/kg). Intestinal segments (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum) were collected and mucus production was assessed using the quantification method. Mucus production in the duodenum and jejunum was significantly lower ( P &lt; 0.05) in group 3 (Mn-Gly) compared to the control and group 2 (MnSO 4 ). In the duodenum in group 2 (MnSO 4 ) mucus production was similar to the control. Biochemical indicators were determined using spectrophotometry, and haematological indicators were measured using a haematology analyzer. Significant changes ( P &lt; 0.05) were found for the concentrations of total proteins and albumins. The concentration of total proteins was lower in group 3 (Mn-Gly) compared to the control and group 2 (MnSO 4 ). In the latter group it was higher compared to the control. The concentration of albumins was higher in group 3 (Mn-Gly) compared to the control and group 2 ( P &lt; 0.05). The results indicate a decrease of intestinal mucus in the group supplemented by Mn-Gly chelate, which may mean a lower mucus barrier for manganese absorption.",

    "abstract": "Fish scale is rich in collagen type I and hydroxyapatite, resembling bone structure. It is readily available, cost effective and can compensate for the limitations of grafting methods such as unavailability, zoonotic disease transmission, and high cost. The aim of this study was to evaluate in vivo the fish scale potential and the possible synergistic effect of platelet rich plasma (PRP) with this scaffold in bone regeneration. Fifteen male white New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into six groups, each involving 5 limbs. Full thickness bicortical defects were created in the proximal tibia of both pelvic limbs of rabbits. The defect was left untreated in the negative control group. In experimental groups the defect was filled with PRP (group 1), cellular fish scale (group 2), combination of cellular fish scale and PRP (group 3), acellular fish scale (group 4), and a combination of acellular fish scale and PRP (group 5). Fresh fish scales were decellularized to increase biocompatibility and reduce immunity reactions. Decellularization was confirmed by DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining. The microstructure and surface characteristics of fish scales were assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Histopathological evaluation of bone healing was performed on day 56. Although there was no significant difference in the bone union among experimental groups, the union was superior in all experimental groups compared to control. Spongiosa and cortex formation were superior in the acellular groups. Furthermore, PRP promoted bone marrow formation. We concluded that fish scale is a biocompatible scaffold with a high regenerative potential.",

We investigated the effects of human ADRCs on the healing of TMJ defects in immunodeficient rabbits. With no prior cultivation, ADRCs were applied to a surgically created defect in the cartilage of a rabbit TMJ. The healing process and inflammatory response were examined. Our results indicated that ADRCs supported repair processes in soft tissues. However, ADRC treatment induced a significant immune response in both soft and hard tissues, with hard tissues showing a higher level of bone remodelling. Non-differentiated ADRCs can be a promising tool for regenerative medicine of TMJ; however, deeper understanding of their effect on the cellular level is needed.",

    "abstract": "In Brazil, gaited horses are selected based on field tests, during which they move at speeds of 3 to 4 m/s for 30 to 60 min. To cover their nutrient requirements, feed manufacturers have developed oil-rich dietary supplements and concentrates. The aim of this research was to evaluate the effects of increasing the density of dietary fats in the feed of 16 Campolina horses undergoing intense gaited training. The training schedule consisted of training 4 × a week: 3 days riding for 60 min (10' warm-up, 40' doing marcha gait, and 10' cool down, and 1 day walking for 90'). The horses were divided in two groups: control and supplemented. The dietary supplementation was isocaloric, with the control group receiving an ordinary concentrate (3.5% fat) and the supplemented group fed 1.0 kg of the supplement (18% fat) plus the ordinary concentrate. Both groups had free access to fresh grass, salt and water. Blood samples were collected prior to and after 4 and 8 weeks of supplementation to calculate the complete blood count, glucose, total protein, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA). The results were evaluated by ANOVA and Tukey's test ( P &lt; 0.05). The supplemented group showed elevated levels of NEFA, red blood cells and haematocrit ( P &lt; 0.05), while the control group showed high triglyceride concentrations; both groups showed reduced plasma protein concentrations ( P &lt; 0.05). The other indices did not change ( P &gt; 0.05). The increase in dietary fat intake increased the blood lipid biomarkers and antioxidant capacity of gaited horses during intense training, possibly contributing to improve their metabolic performance.",

Pharmacology lectures at the University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences Brno, Czech Republic were selected for this experiment. The study focused on stress assessment using haematological and biochemical indices. Blood samples were drawn from 20 rabbits ( Oryctolagus cuniculus f. domesticus L.) 10 days after arrival at the institute (before the first practical lesson), and then in the 7 th and 12 th weeks of the semester with practical lessons. The haematological and biochemical indices were compared between the experimental group (n = 10) used for practical demonstrations and the control group (n = 10) which was kept in its hutch. Practical lessons included manipulation with rabbits, health examination, topical or total application and observation of the drugs’ effects. All the acts were carried out by students. Significant changes were detected in some of haematological (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit) and biochemical (glucose, total protein, enzymes aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase) variables compared to the control group. The values obtained from the last blood sampling indicate a possible habituation process in the experimental group between the 8 th and 12 th week. The results were compared between the experimental and control group and also with the results of other studies with different stressors. In conclusion, the stress the rabbits used for teaching purposes at universities are exposed to, is tolerable.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to describe the methodology of the surgical technique for endoluminal irreversible electroporation in the biliary tract performed within the perihilar region in porcine models. Endoluminal irreversible electroporation of the common bile duct was performed on eight porcine models using an endoluminal device inserted during laparotomy. The endoluminal device consisted of three electrodes 1 cm in length, attached at 120 degrees around the balloon catheter. The procedure was conducted with the following parameters: number of pulses 90, voltage of 1500 V between each couple of electrodes. Cross sectional imaging and histopathological assessment were employed for evaluations of the ablation zone. Models were sacrificed 24 h and 96 h after ablation. The treatment was successful in all porcine models. All animals survived the defined study period. Peri-ablation oedema within the hepatoduodenal ligament and adjacent liver tissue could be measured on post-procedural MRI or CT. Perforation in the site of ablation developed in one model. Histopathological examination showed heavy regressive changes of the ablated tissue. The elastic membranes of the adjacent portal vein were preserved in all models. In our experience, this novel endoluminal modality used within the perihilar region in porcine models is a feasible and well predictable procedure. Further studies should explore the optimal protocol of catheter-based ablation to limit complications.",

    "abstract": "American lobsters are crustaceans that are offered for sale live and are stored in controlled temperature recirculating aquaria. During marketing, they are subjected to stressors that can affect their welfare, such as air exposure, confinement, and handling. European legislation does not provide specific criteria or retention requirements, and so their management depends largely on the common sense of food business operators. Claw ligatures before and during storage are not legally required but are recommended because they prevent lobsters from damaging each other and ensure workers’ safety. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of claw ligatures on the lobsters’ welfare by analysing eight different haemolymph stress indicators, vitality, and weight. The calcium level showed significant differences in the two experimental groups ( P &lt; 0.05). Our results suggested that the absence of rubber bands did not offer any significant contribution to the lobsters’ welfare.",

    "abstract": "Four dairy cows in a positive energy balance were used to study the effect of propylene glycol supplementation variants on blood indices. The treatments were: without glycol, glycol mixed with the total mixed ration (TMR), glycol delivered as top dressing (TD), and glycol administered as an oral drench (OD). Oral drenching had the positive effect of higher blood insulin concentration 1.5 and 2.5 h after supplementation compared to the TD method ( P ≤ 0.05). Glycol supplemented as TD had the negative effect of higher concentration of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) 3.5 h after supplementation ( P ≤ 0.05) with a trend towards a higher mean concentration of this marker ( P ≤ 0.1). A decreasing tendency was recorded for the NEFA concentration 1.5 h after glycol supplementation with TMR or OD ( P ≤ 0.1). Glycol supplemented as OD had the positive effect of lowering the β-hydroxybutyric acid concentration 1.5 and 2.5 h after feeding ( P ≤ 0.05). A downward trend in the mean β-hydroxybutyric acid level after glycol delivery as OD was also observed ( P ≤ 0.1). Glycol supplemented as TD had the negative effect of decreasing dry matter intake of the diet ( P ≤ 0.05). Glycol supplemented as OD had a more glucogenic effect than as part of the TMR. Due to reduction of dry matter intake and the lowest glucogenic effect, using glycol as TD is unjustified. The results confirm that the best method of propylene glycol administration is OD, which can be useful in the prevention of ketosis, however, it should be confirmed in a long-term experiment covering the transition and early lactation periods.",

Semen samples were collected from 11 boars, diluted with a long-term extender and supplemented with different concentration of royal jelly (0%, 0.5%, 1% and 2%) at a final concentration of 50 × 10 6 sperm/ml. In the laboratory, the semen was assessed for sperm morphology, viability (eosin-nigrosin staining), subjective motility and objective sperm motility by sperm class analyzer. In total, 396 tests for sperm viability and motility were performed. The longer storage time and the lower incubation temperature showed lower sperm motility and viability results. The results showed that royal jelly supplementation at 1% concentrations protected the functionality of the sperm plasma membrane during the liquid storage time of 96 h at 16 °C. Sperm subjective and objective motility results in samples stored at 4 °C decreased with higher royal jelly concentrations and longer storage time, and differ significantly from the results in samples stored at 16 °C ( P &lt; 0.05). Our data showed that royal jelly supplementation at lower concentrations can improve boar semen motility and viability parameters during liquid storage at 16 °C for 96 h.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to develop and evaluate the functionality of a new equipment for intrafollicular oocyte transfer (IFOT) in dairy cattle. The new system for IFOT is composed of the applicator, the aspirator, and the injector. After aspiration of oocytes, the IFOT set is inserted into the working tube of the ultrasound transducer holder, the content of the applicator can be injected into the preovulatory follicle via transvaginal ultrasonography by one operator. The function of instruments used for IFOT was firstly verified in laboratory conditions. Slaughterhouse oocytes filled into the instruments were injected into Petri dishes. The highest recovery rates in vitro (97.5%) were achieved when the applicator was stored with the needle in a downward position. Synchronized Holstein heifers were used for in vivo test. Intrafollicular injection of saline (n = 9) was performed to find whether ovulation is affected by the injection. Then IFOTs of phosphate buffered saline with 20 oocytes (n = 21) were performed into the preovulatory follicles followed by 7-day-old embryo collection. Total ovulation rates were 86.7% (26/30). Total recovery rates (oocytes + embryos) were 23.1%, embryo recovery rates were 10.1%. The new instrument allows for the loading of oocytes and easy transportation to recipients, and also allows IFOT to be performed by one person in field conditions. The method does, however, need further investigation.",

    "abstract": "The Lithuanian Žemaitukai horse breed is one of the oldest in Europe. Currently, there is a lack of information about the effect of endurance competition on blood indices and acid–base balance in the Žemaitukai horses. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of endurance exercise on the acid–base balance and electrolyte indicators of the Žemaitukai horses in an official endurance competition. In total, 48 horses of the Žemaitukai breed competed in endurance competitions over the same distance (60 km). Samples were taken before and immediately after the exercise. The following indicators were analysed: the hydrogen potential (pH), partial carbon dioxide pressure (pCO 2 ), partial oxygen pressure (pO 2 ), base excess in blood (BE), base excess in the extracellular fluid [BE (ecf)], cHCO 3 (bicarbonate), cSO 2 (oxygen saturation), tCO 2 (blood total carbon dioxide), haematocrit (HCT), haemoglobin concentration (cHgb), sodium (Na), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), chlorides (Cl), and lactate (Lac). Increase in pH showed adaptation of the horse metabolism to exercise. Blood changes were caused by the development of dehydration and metabolic alkalosis. According to Lac results, all horses were fit and tolerated well physical activity. The exercise did not significantly affect the demand for minerals. Based on the results obtained, it can be stated that horses of the Žemaitukai breed are suitable for endurance competing.",

    "abstract": "Climatic variations directly affect the animals, changing their physiology. Several factors such as species, breed, sex, age, nutrition, diseases, physiological stage, and seasonal variations can affect the pattern of haematological values. Quantitative and morphological changes in blood cells are associated with higher temperatures and humidity. Sixty-seven sheep (3 years old, not pregnant, clinically healthy) were used in the study to determine the effect of the temperature-humidity index (THI) and breed on morphological blood indices and β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). The sheep were divided into groups by the breed (4 breeds) and the THI (2 classes). The blood samples from each animal were collected monthly. Significant differences between the values of leukocytes (WBC), neutrophils (NEU), erythrocytes (RBC), haemoglobin (HGB), haematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), lymphocytes (LYM), monocytes (MON) and platelet count (PLT) in THI groups were observed. In THI 1, the mean values of MCHC (5.68%, P &lt; 0.05), MCH (0.52%), and HCT (4.90%, P &lt; 0.05) were higher compared to those in THI 2. Multivariate test showed a significant effect of breed on NEU ( P &lt; 0.05), RBC ( P &lt; 0.05), HGB ( P &lt; 0.05) and MCHC ( P &lt; 0.05). The concentration of BHB in group THI 2 was by 12.9% higher ( P &lt; 0.05), compared to group THI 1. A significant effect of the breed ( P &lt; 0.05) and THI class ( P &lt; 0.05) on BHB was determined, whereas the impact of breed interaction with the THI was found to be non-significant. The observations reported in this study suggest that the response to temperature is dependent on animal breed. It was found that both morphological blood indices and BHB were affected by the temperature-humidity index.",

O desenvolvimento desse trabalho teve o objetivo de determinar as plantas toxicas de interesse pecuario na regiao do Bico do Papagaio, no norte do Tocantins. Com base nas entrevistas com 85 proprietarios de 20 municipios, os surtos de intoxicacao mais importantes ocorreram pelo envolvimento da Brachiaria decumbens e Palicourea marcgravii. Tambem apresentaram importância os relatos de surtos causados por Ipomoea asarifolia, Manihot esculenta, Enterolobium contortisiliqum, Manihot spp e Pteridium aquilinum. Adicionalmente, a Manihot glaziovii, que possui importância toxicologica para outras regioes do Brasil, tambem parece estar envolvida em surtos na regiao de estudo. Outras plantas toxicas de conhecido interesse pecuario para a regiao Norte do Brasil, como Dimorphandra mollis, Ipomoea carnea subsp. fistulosa, Lantana spp, Palicourea juruana, Ricinus communis, Stryphnodendron obovatum e Sorghum vulgare, embora conhecidas pelos entrevistados nao foram associadas a surtos na regiao, ja a Arrabidaea bilabiata, A. jupurensis e Brachiaria radicans nao eram conhecidas pelos entrevistados e nenhum relato de surto foi mencionado. Parkia pendula, embora nao possua toxicidade comprovada, esteve envolvida em surtos segundo produtores dos municipios de Ananas e Tocantinopolis, desencadeando inapetencia, emagrecimento e apatia em bovinos. Hypolytrum pungens, ainda nao relata na literatura como toxica, esteve envolvida em dois casos de intoxicacao no municipio de Tocantinopolis, nos quais bovinos apresentaram quadro de incoordenacao, segundo relato dos produtores. Conclui-se que a regiao do Bico do Papagaio apresenta caracteristicas peculiares em relacao as plantas toxicas de importância pecuaria, e ainda, que ha necessidade de investigacao sobre plantas cuja toxicidade nao foi comprovada, mas que possivelmente apresentam toxicidade relevante para a pecuaria.\r\n\r\nPalavras-Chave: Toxicologia, intoxicacao, ruminante, bovino, Amazonia, ecotono.",

    "abstract": "The cougar (Puma concolor) is a feline found in various ecological zones of the Americas, including Brazil. In cougar it has been reported parasitism by ticks Ixodidae and endoparasites of different genera and species. However, researches involving the Brazilian wild fauna are still few. Therefore, this research study aimed at evaluating the gastrointestinal parasitism in P. concolor kept in captivity in the central region of Rio Grande do Sul state. Fecal samples of an adult cougar were analyzed by the direct smear method, centrifugal flotation technique with zinc sulfate and kinyon staining method. Mixed infection by oocysts of Cryptosporidium sp. and eggs of Trichuris sp. were observed. Moreover, the samples showed oocysts of coccidea suggestive of Toxoplasma gondii or Besnoitia sp. Based on the results, one can conclude that the cougar is a potential host of these parasites, presenting with asymptomatic. However, future studies are needed to determine the true role of the feline in environment related to the spread of these parasites.",

Accordingly, the aim of the present article is to describe a case of urolithiasis in an adult female lesser seed finch (Sporophila angolensis) pet bird which presented abdominal distension, respiratory distress, and apathy prior to death. The bird had history of being fed with a diet rich in protein. After the bird death, a necropsy was conducted in order to determine the cause of death. At necropsy, accentuated ascites, hydropericardium, and ureteral stones in the left ureter could be grossly observed. Additional tests related with viral and bacterial microbiological testing and with the determination of calculi composition could not be performed since the owner did not consent with the procedures because of the cost. Since the bird was fed on a high protein diet, a relationship between the ureteroliths and dietary imbalance was suggested with participation of protein in calculi development by providing the organic nuclei. Additionally, we conclude that the presence of calculi in the ureter resulted in urinary flow blockage, ascites, and consequent acute respiratory failure due to filling of air sacs with liquid.",

The aim of our study was to verify and determine an appropriate challenge dose for efficacy tests in dogs for the following Leptospira serovars: L. grippotyphosa, L. icterohaemorrhagiae and L. canicola. The appropriate challenge dose was determined on the basis of pathognomonic symptoms of infection, Leptospira capture at cultivation and pathological changes in dogs infected experimentally with various doses (5 × 10 4 - 5 × 10 8 ) of Leptospira serovars. A dose of 5 × 10 6 of each respective serovar administered intraperitoneally was determined to be a suitable challenge dose. The dogs infected with the selected dose showed the typical symptoms of the disease and met the requirements of an objective and standard evaluation of the vaccine efficacy according to the pharmacopoeial monograph.

Bipolar electrodes were surgically implanted into the muscular layer of the vascular smooth muscle cell of the abdominal aorta just below the renal arteries. Myoelectric activity characterized by the appearance of changes of membrane potential was found. Changes of potential could be divided according to the amplitude, duration and frequency into first-, second- and third-order waves. First-order waves appeared with a mean frequency of 128 ± 14/min. The mean wave amplitude was 0.150 ± 0.03 mV, and the mean duration was 0.43 ± 0.05 s. They were closely correlated with the electrocardiogram and blood pressure changes. Second-order waves appeared with a mean frequency of 15.9 ± 4.4/min. They were characterized by a mean duration of 2.69 ± 1.5 s. The mean amplitude of the discharge was 0.205 ± 0.157 mV for the second-order wave, they were correlated with the animal’s respiratory action. Third-order waves appeared with a mean frequency of 4.03 ± 1.07/ min. They were characterized by a mean duration of 11.81 ± 5.3 s. The mean amplitude of the discharge was 0.345 ± 0.232 mV for the third-order wave and they were associated with the autonomic control of the lumen of the blood vessel. For the first time the usefulness of the electromyography method in monitoring changes in the vascular smooth muscle cell of pig abdominal aorta was proved.",

This experiment was performed on 96 chickens of two hybrids (Ross 308 and Cobb 500) of both sexes. The chickens were divided into 3 groups (control group and two groups with restricted feeding). There were 8 chickens in each group. After hatching, the control group was fed a standard mixture ad libitum . The first restricted group was fed 80% ad libitum from the age of 2 weeks. The second restricted group, from the age of 2 weeks, was fed 65% ad libitum . The experiment lasted for 5 weeks. The liver samples were obtained by necropsy, then weighed, and after this processed by standard histological methods. The slices of liver were stained with haematoxyline-eosin. The liver samples were evaluated both objectively and subjectively. In the control group, steatosis and marginal pathological acute venosis hyperaemia were found. In the group with 80% restriction, perilobular steatosis was observed. In the group with 65% restriction, centrolobular steatosis was observed. Controlled measurement of the average hepatocyte thickness in the individual sample groups was performed using an objective method. The hepatocyte diameter thickness of males was higher than the hepatocyte diameter thickness of females, which was significant ( P &lt; 0.001). This is the first work providing the possibility of morphometrical verification of the time factor including other morphological criteria.",

    "abstract": "The structure of the small intestine of neonatal pigs has an important effect on immunoglobulin absorption. The aim of the experiment was to observe changes in the mucous membrane and the presence of immunoglobulins in the intestines of piglets during the first hours of their postnatal lives. In total, 80 piglets of the Large White breed were divided into two groups of 40 pigs. One group (control) came from an infection-free breeding, the other (experimental) group came from a breeding with the reproduction and respiration syndrome of pigs. Samples (n = 80) of duodenum, jejunum and ileum were taken at intervals of 0, 3, 6 and 12 h after colostrum intake in order to carry out histological tests. Primary pig antibodies were detected by immunohistochemical staining. The low content of immunoglobulins IgG, IgA and IgM was detected in all segments of intestines of precolostral piglets. Difference ( P &lt; 0.05) in size of the mucous membrane was found in the duodenum at the interval of 0, 3 and 6 h (46.03%), in the jejunum at 0 and 12 h (45.98%) and in favour of the control group. Compared to the control group, more Ig ( P &lt; 0.01) antibodies were observed in the experimental group: in the duodenum IgG at 12 h (37.22 vs. 10.81%), IgA, 6 h (43.29 vs. 16.71%), IgM, 12 h (25.29 vs. 8.40%), in the jejunum at IgG 12 h (23.97 vs. 9.96%), IgA, 0 h (0.48 vs. 0.37%) and IgM, 3 h (21.80 vs. 10.10%), in the ileum IgG, 0 h (0.38 vs. 0.29%), IgA, 3 h (20.46 vs. 6.45%), IgM, 3 h (31.5 vs. 12.29%). We can conclude that the colostrum intake and the presence of reproduction and respiration syndrome of pigs resulted in changes of microscopic structures of intestines as well as in the presence of Ig in piglet intestines. These mucosal changes significantly affect the development of passive immunity in piglets in the postnatal period.",

The aim of the study was to evaluate the participation of α 1 -adrenergic receptor subtypes in the contractility of the aortic smooth muscle cells in rabbits. The in vitro experiments were performed in isolated tissue preparations from 30 adult female New Zealand rabbits. The abdominal aortic sections were placed in organ bath chambers and contracted with increasing doses of non-selective α 1 -adrenergic receptor agonist phenylephrine without pre-incubation or after incubation in α 1 -adrenergic receptor subtype-selective or non-selective antagonists. Separate sections were incubated with increasing concentrations of antagonists. Phenylephrine caused maximal rise in arterial smooth muscle tone to 4.75 ± 0.47 mN. The most potent in blocking phenylephrine induced contraction was 5-metylurapidil (α 1A -adrenergic receptor antagonist) followed by phentolamine and prazosin (non-selective α 1 -adrenergic receptor antagonists); BMY 7378 (α 1D -adrenergic receptor antagonist), cyclazosin and L-765.314 (α 1B -adrenergic receptor antagonists) were less effective. All antagonists, except BMY 7378 elicited relaxation of non-precontracted aorta in dose dependent manner. Our results indicate that postsynaptic α 1A receptors are the most potent in producing rabbit abdominal aorta contraction, while α 1B and α 1D subtypes are less effective.",

We found a decreased number of eggs per gram in all horses, but an increase in benzimidazole resistance, which was found in 5 farms out of 6 (faecal egg count reduction test 15.2–84.6%). This is the first wide survey in horses from the Czech Republic. Based on this study, we can conclude that benzimidazole resistant cyathostomins in horses are widespread but ivermectin is still fully effective.",

A Holstein cow weighted 500 kg and was 4 years old, with dairy milk production of 18 liters, and was created under intensive system. The main clinical signs observed in the front right quarter, with drop in milk production and presence of flocks in the wired cup test. Two samples of milk were collected from the animals and sent to Laboratorio de Microbiologia Veterinaria at UFERSA. The samples were streaked on Sabouraud agar and incubated under aerobic conditions for 48 hours at 37 o C. After 72 hours the colonies had presented a diameter varying between 3 and 6 mm and irregular edges with central elevation. An antibiogram was also performed, and revealed resistance to all antibiotics tested: getamicin (10mg), chloramphenicol (30 mg), ceftriaxone (30 mg), cefoxitin (30 mg), vancomycin (30 mg), polymyxin (300mg), novobicin (30mg), streptomycin (10mg) and cephalothin (30mg).\r\n\r\nKeywords: Bovine mastitis, Prototheca, algae, antibiogram.",

    "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species contribute to kill of microorganisms. Their activity is usually measured by their capacity to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium into formazan. The incubation time to allow nitroblue tetrazolium reduction by reactive oxygen species usually ranges from 30 to 60 min. The aim of our study was to determine the kinetics of formazan formation, to determine the shortest incubation time possible, and to find if astaxanthin negatively affects the availability of reactive oxygen species (and defense mechanisms of fish). The blood/nitroblue tetrazolium method is based on nitroblue tetrazolium reduction into formazan by reactive oxygen species present in blood. Formazan can be spectrophotometrically measured, allowing quantification of reactive oxygen species. Reactive oxygen species were measured in blood samples from 30 trout intramuscularly injected with astaxanthin (0.3 mg/100 g of fish) (experimental group) and 30 non-injected trout (controls). Results indicated that in trout non-treated with astaxanthin, the plateau of formazan production was reached after 20 min of incubation. Trout intramuscularly injected with astaxanthin showed the following: on Day 1 after astaxanthin injection, the kinetics were slower but finally reached a plateau similar to astaxanthin-free trouts, and by Day 11 the plateau was significantly higher after 60 min incubation. In conclusion, the kinetics curves here reported allow reducing incubation time of the method to only 20 min in antioxidant-free trout and, on the other hand, our results also revealed that astaxanthin can be used to improve flesh colour in salmonids without affecting reactive oxygen species availability and therefore the defense mechanisms of trout.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the concentration of selected transition metals, i.e. iron (Fe), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) in the livers of laying hens free from and infested with the red mite ( Dermanyssus gallinae) and to explain the effects of the invasion of this parasite on the content of those elements. The study was carried out on 24 Hy-Line Brown hens bred in battery cages. The birds were divided into two groups, free from and infested with D. gallinae . Concentration of analysed metals was determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Based on this experiment, it was proved that a long-term (52 weeks) exposure of hens to D. gallinae resulted in a significant ( P &lt; 0.05) decrease of Fe, Cu and Zn in the liver. The mean content of analysed metals in the group infested with the parasite amounted to 31.42 mg Fe/kg, 2.71 mg Cu/kg and 22.64 mg/kg, whereas in the non-infested group it was 38.51 mg Fe/kg, 3.12 mg Cu/kg and 26.53 mg Zn/kg. No significant ( P &lt; 0.05) alterations in haematological indicators were found between the examined groups of birds. The results may suggest that 3 weeks of recovery in hens are sufficient to bring about a considerable increase in concentration of analysed transition metals in the liver.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring of changes in the behaviour of dairy cows related to the occurrence of insects in the stable and in the milking parlour was carried out on a selected dairy farm during the summer season. The effect of the number of insects on the occurrence of huddling of dairy cows in the stable was proved. Huddling occurred significantly ( P = 0.003) more often when the number of insects captured by fly glue traps exceeded 500 individuals. The occurrence of pest flies affected also the behaviour of dairy cows during milking. With the increasing number of insects captured by glue traps in the milking parlour, the cows more frequently kicked off the milking units (r = 0.944, P &lt; 0.001) and defecated (r = 0.940, P &lt; 0.001) during milking. In addition, the increasing number of captured insects correlated with a significantly lower milk yield in cows (r = -0.709, P &lt; 0.001). The number of insects in the stable also correlated with the incidence of mastitis in dairy cows on the monitored farm (r = 0.681, P &lt; 0.001) during the summer season. The study shows that pest flies affect the behaviour of cows which is further reflected in their health, milk production and thus the overall farm performance.",

    "abstract": "Sertoli cells play a crucial role in male fertility through boosting and regulating the differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells into mature sperm during spermatogenesis. Female ovarian follicles are responsible for the production of mature ova and control of ovarian steroidogenesis. Disruption of these structures through exposure to environmental pollutants is critical for reproductive health. Here, we derived primary cell cultures of Sertoli cells and ovarian follicles from fallow deer ( Dama dama ). Cells were used as in vitro models to explore reproductive toxicity of heavy metals in wild species. Adverse effects of cadmium (CdCl 2 ), methylmercury (MeHgCl 2 ), and lead (PbCl 2 ) were investigated through a range of equal molar concentrations (0, 15, 30, 60, 125, 250 µM). We found both concentration-dependent and independent cytotoxic patterns ( P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.05) in cells exposed to CdCl 2 , MeHgCl 2 , and PbCl 2 . Based on generation of lipid hydroperoxides, significant levels of cell oxidative perturbation were detected in the CdCl 2 ( P = 0.0001), PbCl 2 ( P = 0.001), and MeHgCl 2 ( P = 0.003) groups. Likewise, the antioxidant enzymes catalase and glutathione peroxidase were inhibited in all metal-treated groups ( P &lt; 0.01). Genotoxic DNA damage (single-strand break) was also observed (MeHgCl 2 group, P = 0.002; CdCl 2 and PbCl 2 groups, P = 0.004). Increased activity of superoxide dismutase ( P = 0.0002 and P = 0.01) was observed in MeHgCl 2 and CdCl 2 , respectively. Cell apoptosis was detected in all the PbCl 2 and CdCl 2 ( P = 0.00007) and MeHgCl 2 ( P = 0.001) groups. The results of this study can be used to characterize the responsiveness of fallow deer gonadal cells to the stress of toxic metal exposure.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Tenebrio molitor larvae meal supplementation in chicken diets on the chemical composition and sensory quality of meat. The experiment was conducted on 120 Ross 308 male broilers from day 12 to day 38 of their age. Broilers were divided into three equal groups with 5 replicates per treatment. The two experimental groups received feed mixtures containing 2% (TM2; n = 40) and 5% (TM5; n = 40), respectively of yellow mealworm ( Tenebrio molitor L.) meal. The third group (TM0; n = 40) was control, receiving 0% of mealworms in diet. The addition of mealworm meal to diets in this trial do not worsen the chemical composition or sensory characteristics of the thigh meat of broilers. The control chickens had a higher live weight ( P &lt; 0.05) compared to the experimental groups at the end of the trial. The lowest live weight and feed intake was determined in group TM2 ( P &lt; 0.05). The highest feed intake ( P &lt; 0.05) was found in the control group. The breast meat from the control group was rated better ( P &lt; 0.05) in flavour compared to the groups receiving 2% and 5% of yellow mealworms. The primary requirement for the use of any ingredient in feed is that it does not adversely affect food safety and quality. In our study, the inclusion of 2% and 5% mealworm meal in the broiler’s diet had no influence on meat quality.",

Foram coletados uteros gravidicos entre 4 a 8 meses de gestacao. Realizou-se seccao dorsal ao longo da cervix ate o corpo do utero. A peca foi invertida para verificacao da idade fetal e coleta dos placentonios. Foram coletados placentonios, do corno uterino gestante e nao gestante com forma oval, circular e em fusao. Em seguida as pecas foram fixadas em solucao de formol a 10%, para posterior preparacao histologica em parafina e coloracao em hematoxilina-eosina. Os placentonios apresentavam um estroma endometrial bem desenvolvido e vascularizado revestindo a caruncula e apresentando lacunas, os cotiledones possuiam vilosidades revestidas por celulas trofoblasticas uninucleadas e binucleadas. O epitelio da mucosa era do tipo prismatico simples e as glândulas do corio proximas ao limite do miometrio possuiam aspecto tortuoso. Caruncula e cotiledone estavam revestidos respectivamente por epitelio cubico simples e celulas trofoblasticas em meio a lacunas da placenta. A partir dos 6 meses observou-se um estroma fibrovascular compacto. Concluiu-se que a placenta mesmo possuindo diversidade anatomica entre as estruturas encontradas, apresenta caracteristicas histologicas semelhantes em todos os periodos gestacionais estudados, e o crescimento dos placentonios no decorrer da gestacao parece estar relacionado com a multiplicacao das celulas que formam os cotiledones e carunculas, bem como da vascularizacao.\r\n\r\nPalavras-Chave: Placenta, utero, vaca zebu, celulas trofoblasticas gigantes.",

We evaluated digital radiographs of elbows (n = 26) with arthroscopically or arthrotomically proven FCP and digital radiographs of healthy elbows (n = 28). A template was made on radiographs in the JiveX program (Visus Technology Transfer) demarcating individual regions of interest (ROI) in which median optical density was measured. For normalisation of median optical density data of individual ROI, median optical density of the caudal ulnar cortex was used. Elbow joints with fragmented processus coronoideus had a lower mean median optical density in the distal part of incisura trochlearis compared to healthy elbow joints. The lowest median optical densities were found in the region of processus coronoideus medialis and in the distal part of the trochlear notch of the ulna in the region of processus coronoideus lateralis. The biggest difference in median optical densities between elbows with FCP and healthy elbows was found in regions distant from the articular surface. In evaluation of the opacity of the trochlear notch of the ulna it is appropriate to assess the whole region of the proximal ulnar metaphysis from the articular surface to the caudal ulnar cortex.",

Myometrial slices were incubated for 16 h with IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α (1 or 10 ng/ml of medium) or two combinations of the three cytokines (1 or 10 ng/ml of each cytokine per combination). We demonstrated the stimulatory effect of IL-1β and IL-6 on PGF 2α and PGE 2 secretion from myometrium collected on all examined days of pregnancy, excepting of influence of IL-6 on release of PGF 2α by tissue from day 30. In turn, TNF-α was able to stimulate only PGE 2 secretion by myometrium of 40-day-pregnant gilts. The three cytokines applied in combination augmented release of PGE 2 from myometrium collected on days 30 and 40 of pregnancy. Stimulation of PGE 2 secretion by cytokines used individually was more frequent than that of PGF 2α . Moreover, an enhancement in PGF 2α and/or PGE 2 release was accompanied by an increase of COX-2 protein expression. Our study shows the ability of cytokines to stimulate PGF 2α and PGE 2 release by porcine myometrium from the first third of pregnancy. Obtained data suggest that locally PGs produced in myometrium influencing the uterine contraction activity may be important for the maintenance of myometrial quiescence during pregnancy and confirm also that the complex cytokine network is an important regulatory mechanism of PGs production during pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "The effect of a non-medicated diet with or without a grain extract feed additive (benzoquinones as main active ingredients) on the growth of rabbits and certain physiological indicators of the digestive tract was examined. One-day-old rabbits of average birth weight were distributed into litters of eight, and these litters were randomly divided into three groups (21-22 litters/group). The control group (Group C) received a basal diet. The diet fed to rabbits of Group IM, was supplemented with a feed additive containing natural basic ingredients (Immunovet-HBM, 1 kg/t); the diet fed to Group M was medicated (tiamulin, oxytetracycline and diclazuril). Three days prior to kindling and up to weaning at 21 days of age of the pups, the does were fed one of the three diets ad libitum . Young rabbits were allowed to consume the same diets beside their mother’s milk before weaning. Significant ( p &lt; 0.05) difference in body weight between groups was detected only at the ages of 4 and 8 weeks. The pH of the gastric content remained significantly ( p &lt; 0.05) higher in Group IM after weaning. Rabbits in Group IM showed the highest pancreatic enzyme (trypsin, lipase, α-amylase) activities throughout the period studied. The composition of microflora of the caecum was only slightly altered by the treatment. The total volatile fatty acid content (tVFA) increased with age and from day 28 it was significantly ( p &lt; 0.05) higher in the C and IM group than in M rabbits. The proportion of butyric acid was lower than that of propionic acid even on the 42nd day in Group M. From the results of this study it is clear that the early weaning of rabbits can be accomplished by the use of a non-medicated diet without any decrease in weight gain. In our study the grain extract feed additive exerted a beneficial effect by increasing the pancreatic enzyme activity and maintaining a better VFA ratio.",

    "abstract": "This study compares two fish farms in the Jihlava River basin that differ mainly in the intensity of rearing of the nase fry and in water sources. During rearing, we observed the health condition of fry from hatching to expedition at the age of one year. Four species of parasites (i.e., Ambiphrya ameiuri , Apiosoma piscicolum , Trichodina sp., Diplostomum spathaceum ) were found to infest the fish and Aeromonas hydrophila was isolated by bacterial culture. In both breeding facilities the intensity and prevalence of Ambiphrya ameiuri increased during the summer. The state of health and its development including the recognised infections was similar in both farms. Immunological indicators such as differential white cell count, absolute white cell count and the oxidative burst in autumn were evaluated in the fry samples. Although fry from both farms had similar health condition, the results on immunological indicators show that fry from farm I are more exposed to the effects of stressors. In the next phase, we confronted immunological indicators of fry from farm II and brood fish from the Jihlava River. The results show differences in immunological indicators, which could be caused by a variety of stress factors having different effects on the immune system of these two fish categories. The environment affects greatly the immunity of juvenile as well as brood fish. It reflects in the different levels of immunological indicators in the comparison of fry from two farms as well as in the comparison of fry and brood fish from the river.",

The myometrial reactivity to oxytocin (10 -6 mol l-1) was investigated by an in vitro method in female rabbits 14 days after ovariectomy treated with 17β-estradiol - 1 mg/kg/day i.m. for 7 days, or with a combination of progesterone 2 mg/kg/day s.c. for 7 days and 17β-estradiol - 0.2 mg/ kg/day (day 3–7). The strips of myometrial smooth muscle were incubated with a specific opener (NS 1619) and an antagonist (TEA) of potassium large conductance calcium-activated channel, or with a specific opener (pinacidil) and an antagonist (glybenclamide) of ATP-sensitive potassium channels before the administration of oxytocin. NS1619 produced more potent inhibition of the oxytocin-induced contraction during the gestagen dominance (experimental secretory phase) than the one observed during the oestrogen dominance (experimental proliferatory phase). TEA antagonized the NS1619 induced inhibition of the myometrial contraction. In the matter of K ATP potassium channels, after the administration of pinacidil we observed a similar situation in the changes of myometrial contractility. Pinacidil produced more pronounced inhibition of oxytocin-induced contraction during the secretory phase, and its effect was abolished by the selective inhibitor glybenclamide. Our experimental results indicate that both potassium large conductance calcium-activated channels and ATP-sensitive potassium channels significantly participate in the regulation of myometrial oxytocin-induced contractions and the activity of these channels is probably influenced by the levels of oestrogens and gestagens.",

A total of 54 blood samples for serum TXB 2 measurements were collected from six healthy beagle dogs into two separate serum tubes.

The average weight of birds was 2 694 ± 32.6 g for cockerels and 2 345 ± 23.9 g for pullets. The study birds did not show any clinical signs of leg diseases. The long bones of the right pelvic limbs (femur and tibiotarsus) were collected after bird slaughter and after removal of soft tissues, they were used for laboratory analyses. The crude protein content and the amino acid (AA) composition were determined and the obtained values were recalculated to 100% dry matter. The chemical score (CS) and the essential amino acid index (EAAI) were calculated for each AA. As a standard, the hen egg ovalbumin was used. The crude protein content in 100% dry matter shows that the content of crude protein was significantly higher ( P ⪬ 0.01) in the femur (405.3 ± 17.21 g/kg) compared to the tibiotarsus (393.5 ± 12.68 g/kg). The same trends were found with regard to sex. Both males and females had significantly ( P ⪬ 0.01) higher crude protein content in the femur (406.6 ± 19.34 g/kg and 404.1 ± 15.09 g/kg, respectively) than in the tibiotarsus (395.0 ± 12.16 g/kg and 392.1 ± 13.21 g/kg, respectively). Both bones showed the highest contents of Gly, Glu and Pro, and the lowest contents of Met, Tyr and His. The same trends were found with regard to chicken sex. Collagenous protein has lower contents of most AA in comparison to the standard protein - ovalbumin; especially contents of Ser, Val, Met, Ileu and Phe are substantially lower. On the other hand, collagenous protein had higher contents of Gly, Pro, His and Arg. The collagenous protein EAAI for the femur and the tibiotarsus was 59.0% and 57.4%, respectively. The knowledge of amino acid composition in protein from long bones of the pelvic limb in broiler chickens is important because it can help us understand the origin of bone disorders.",

Originally, the strains were isolated from Japanese quails after their landing from flight onboard the orbital station Mir during the experiment in August 1990. Because taxonomy as well as the studies concerning the bacteriocins, especially those produced by enterococci, have been continually developed for years, the aim of this study was to confirm species identification, stability of the properties of enterococci as well as to test new properties after their long storage. Genotyping allotted the strains to the species E. faecium . Lactic acid production was detected in similar amounts in the strains before and after their long-storage in dry-frozen form. The strains were vancomycinsensitive and kanamycin-resistant before as well as after their long-time storage. Variability in sensitivity to different antibiotics was found among the strains tested even before and after longtime storage. Each of the strains possessed at least one structural enterocin gene. The structural genes for enterocin A, P, B, L50B were detected in E. faecium EP7. E. faecium EP2, EEP4 have the genes for ent A, B, L50B. The gene for ent P was detected only in the strain EP7. The most often detected was ent A gene followed by ent genes B, L50B. All strains inhibited growth of at least 4 out of 15 indicators.

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of three different chemical feed phosphates on the blood biochemical indicators and the content of main minerals of bones in finishing pigs. Over a period of 85 days of fattening, monocalcium (MCP, Finnish product), dicalcium (DCP, Polish product) and calcium-sodium (CSP, Russian product) phosphates were used in fattener feeding. The feeding was based on standard mixtures of starter, grower and finisher type. Dicalcium phosphate was produced according to the new, pro-ecological technology based on phosphoric acid. The content of Ca, Na, P, solubility of P in citric acid, and the concentration of undesirable substances (As, Cd, F, Hg and Pb) were determined in feed phosphates. At the end of the fattening period, blood was collected from 36 finishing pigs (12 from each group) and the following biochemical indicators were determined in the serum: enzymatic activity of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), creatine kinase (CK), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), lactic acid (LA); the concentration of total protein, albumins, glucose, urea, creatinine, content of triglycerides, cholesterol and its high density lipoproteins (HDL) and low density lipoproteins (LDL) fractions, and mineral components concentration (Ca, Cl, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Na, P, Zn). Basic macroelement content (Ca, Mg, P) was determined in the thigh bones from 30 pigs (10 from each group). Significant differences ( p &lt; 0.05) between groups were observed only in some biochemical indicators, i.e. CK, LDH and LA. The highest content of Ca, Mg and P was found in the bones of pigs fed mixtures supplemented with DCP which indicates improved bioavailability of main macroelements from that phosphate.",

    "abstract": "The study was aimed at defining leptin gene polymorphism and its potential association with values of particular features of fattening and slaughter value of gilts of Line 990. The study included a total of 208 gilts. The polymorphic locus in LEP gene was identified by the restriction enzyme Hinf I in 3469 position, by using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment-length polymorphism (PCR–RFLP) method. Two alleles of LEP gene were identified: T (0.94) and C (0.06), resulting in two genotypes: TC (0.12) and TT (0.88). We did not observe any gilts of CC genotype. The analysis of values of fattening and slaughter features, depending on LEP genotype did not reveal significant differences in body mass increase, daily gain from day 63 to 180, and daily gain from birth to day 180, feed conversion per 1 kg body mass and the loin-eye thickness. Significant differences between the LEP genotypes were present for such features as the backfat thickness at points P2 ( p ⪬ 0.05) and P4 ( p ⪬ 0.01) and average backfat thickness ( p ⪬ 0.01) in favour of TT genotype. We noted higher average values of lean meat content in carcass in favour of TT homozygotes, compared to the heterozygotes ( p ⪬ 0.05). The investigation contributes additonal information regarding LEP gene polymorphism in gilts of Line 990. Knowledge of LEP genotypes may be useful to improve the slaughter value in gilts primarily due to less fatness. Due to the lack of individuals representing CC genotype in our results, research should continue on a larger population.",

We focused on morphological changes in the wall of the subrenal aorta in rats suffering from arterial hypertension and chronic renal failure induced by 5/6 nephrectomy (NX). We quantified the area of the profile of the arterial lumen, the volume fraction of elastin and smooth muscle cells (SMC) in the tunica media, the thickness of the intima-media, the length density of elastin lamellae, the lamellar unit thickness and the lamellar number. Calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) was assayed in extracts of aortic tissue and in plasma. Ten days after the subtotal nephrectomy, the structure of the aorta of NX rats did not differ compared to control animals. Pronounced structural changes were observed ten weeks after 5/6 nephrectomy. The area of the lumen profile, the elastin volume fraction and the elastin lamellar number in the tunica media were all significantly higher ( p &lt; 0.001) in NX than in control animals. The SMC volume fraction in the tunica media and the lamellar unit thickness were lower ( p &lt; 0.001) in NX than in control animals. The CGRP concentration was significantly higher ( p &lt; 0.05) in the aortas and in plasma of NX rats both ten days and ten weeks after operation when compared to sham operated animals. Our study demonstrated intensive remodelling of the aorta over the course of 10 weeks following induction of chronic renal failure.

High correlation was found (r = 0.96 and r = 0.90, respectively) based on the results of 548 bovine serum samples, of which 357 were from clinically healthy cows and 191 from cows and calves monitored during treatment for the most common diseases. The Hp detection limit of ELISA using polyclonal Ab was 0.1 mg/l and using MoAb 0.21 mg/l. The addition of 2% PEG 6000 at the antibody-binding steps enabled major shortening of the incubation periods. The relatively short time, low cost of reagents, and high correlation with the reference method support the use of these ELISA variants in bovine diagnostics.",

A significant body weight loss ( P &lt; 0.01) was found in the mares after the foaling. The peak of insulin growth factor 1 concentration in serum was reached at the day of parturition and similar patterns were revealed for the concentrations of insulin and glucose. After parturition, all these indices were significantly decreased. The concentrations of phosphorus and triacylglycerols were decreased, while the concentrations of potassium and sodium were increased at the day of parturition. Moreover, the concentration of non-esterified fatty acids was increased at the day of parturition ( P &lt; 0.05) with a tendency to higher values even on the 7 th day postpartum. Other studied indexes remained relatively stable throughout the transition period. We can conclude that periparturient mares face some degree of negative energy balance with concomitant significant homeostatic and homeorhetic changes. For this reason, our results can be used as a basis for reference values and a diagnostic tool to examine the health status in horses during the transition period.",

We also sought to histopathologically classify and characterize the mast cell tumours. Mast cell tumour was the most common neoplasm, accounting for 16.78% of skin neoplasms. In terms of the epidemiological data, the mast cell tumours did not show sexual predilection. Animals aged 9 to 12 years were the most affected (44.14%). The genitalia were the most frequent location (28.15%), and mongrel dogs showed the highest prevalence (30.43%), followed by boxers (22.61%). A total of 92 slides were classified; grade II was most frequently seen (61.96%). Statistically, injuries such as necrosis, oedema, and haemorrhage were not related with histological classification ( P &gt; 0.05). Finally, the mitotic index was related to tumour grade ( P &lt; 0.05), and can act as an instrument for histological classification of these tumours. Mast cell tumour is the most common neoplasm in dogs, with no sex predilection. Contrary to what was expected, oedema, necrosis and haemorrhage do not increase according to graduation and can be seen in all classifications. Mitotic index is the best indicator to classify these neoplasms.",

The mass in the area of the left ovary was suspected based on palpation, x-ray, ultrasonography of the abdominal cavity and the presence of the mass in the abdomen was confirmed by probatory laparotomy. Since the lesion was inoperable due to its size and infiltrative growth, the animal was euthanized. Leiomyosarcoma of the ovary with infiltrative growth into spleen and pancreas was diagnosed based on histopathological examination and the diagnosis was proved by immunohistochemical staining for the presence of smooth muscle actin. This is the first described case of this type of tumour in young intact female guinea pig.

The animal gut plays a key role in the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria, allowing the selection, multiplication and subsequent contamination of the farm environment. However, applicable procedures for reducing such bacteria on farms are currently unavailable. The present study was aimed to determine whether a probiotic administration to new-born dairy calves would reduce faecal shedding of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and/or AmpC-positive Escherichia coli during the pre-weaning period. Ten randomly assigned new-born Holstein calves on a dairy farm with recent evidence of high occurrence of AmpC-positive Escherichia coli among calves were treated by a probiotic mix within 12 h after birth. Nine control calves were not treated. Faecal samples were collected from each calf daily on days 2 through 5, and then on days 7, 10, and 14. The faecal samples were cultured, and the mean numbers of cefotaxime-resistant Escherichia coli and confirmed enteroaggregative Escherichia coli were compared between the two groups. Results suggested that the Enterococcus faecium probiotic treatment ( Enterococcus faecium M74, NCIMB 11181 ) of new-born calves did not reduce the enteroaggregative Escherichia coli counts in their faeces. There was no significant difference in the shedding of enteroaggregative Escherichia coli between the probiotic-treated and control calves throughout the two-week study period.",

We report an evaluation of the radioactive contamination of the meat of wild boars hunted in the Novohradské (Gratzen) Mountains in the period of December 2012 to December 2019. Radionuclide 137 Cs is surveyed for food safety as a source of food chain contamination and a possible risk for human health. Overall, 654 samples of game meat from wild boars were analysed for 137 Cs activity. The 137 Cs legal limit of 600 Bq·kg -1 was exceeded in 238 samples (36.4%) of hunted wild boar meat. Statistical analysis showed that 137 Cs activities measured in wild boar muscle in March reached lower values compared to the period from June till November ( P &lt; 0.05). Higher values were reported in September ( P &lt; 0.05) as well as in August ( P &lt; 0.01) compared to December. A signiﬁcant season-based 137 Cs level was found ( P &lt; 0.000). Higher 137 Cs activities in wild boar in the winter season (November to April) are related to decreasing access to a naturally occurring diet with a lower 137 Cs content. The keepers of the wild boar in this area were ordered to comply with obligatory emergency veterinary precautions set by the Regional Veterinary Administration to analyse all hunted game meat for radiocaesium. All wild boars with an above-limit 137 Cs value had to be excluded from the food chain by hunting ground keepers and disposed of safely.",

We were interested in the degree of correlation of vitamin E in plasma and RBCs within the individual categories. Blood on EDTA was collected from 61 cows and 12 calves. As a part of the haematological examination, we determined haematocrit (HCT) immediately after the collection. We determined vitamin E from plasma and RBCs by a standard HPLC method. We compared the results of vitamin E in plasma and RBCs and correlated them. The concentration of vitamin E in the plasma and RBCs was 6.98 and 3.45 μmol/l, respectively, in cows 2–3 weeks antepartum ; 1–3 weeks of lactation it was 4.98 and 3.34; 2.5–3 months of lactation 11.76 and 2.80 μmol/l; and in the case of calves 12.07 and 6.29 μmol/l. Weak correlations were observed between vitamin E in plasma and the RBC concentrations in the antepartum category R 2 = 0.2076; 1–3 weeks of lactation R 2 = 0.0369; 2.5–3 months of lactation R 2 = 0.2403 and calves on dairy nutrition R 2 = 0.4628. Vitamin E concentrations in RBCs were shown to be more stable than in plasma, where the concentrations varied. It is possible that vitamin E in RBCs could tell us more about the longer-term reserves of vitamin E in the organism. The highest concentration of vitamin E in plasma and RBCs, as well as a stronger correlation was found in calves.",

    "abstract": "Articular cartilage degeneration represents one of the main features of osteoarthritis. Recently, novel approaches based on biomaterials have been successfully applied to osteochondral regeneration. Our study was carried out on rabbits to assess a model of articular cartilage damage to test biomaterials for osteochondral regeneration. We created osteochondral defects on the surface of the trochlear groove area of the femurs in 15 white male New Zealand rabbits of the size of 3 mm × 3 mm (diameter × depth). Rabbits were then monitored and samples were collected 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks after the operation. The reconstruction of defects was assessed macroscopically according to the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) scale and radiography (X-ray). For microscopic evaluation, haematoxylin-eosin staining and safranin O staining were used. The defects were repaired by regenerative tissue, and the recovery results gradually increased after 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks, showing both microscopically and macroscopically. However, the regenerative tissue was mainly fibrous connective tissue, not cartilage or bone. This is a model of articular cartilage damage that is suitable for early screening of preclinical studies related to osteochondral regeneration using biomaterials.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to reveal the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced lipid peroxidation and DNA damage in ovine pulmonary adenocarcinomas (OPA) by evaluating malondialdehyde (MDA) and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) expressions by immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence methods. Lung tissue samples were collected from 26 sheep brought to the Pathology Department for routine diagnosis. Lung tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, following routine procedures tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Avidin-Biotin Peroxidase method was used as immunohistochemical staining. Indirect immunofluorescence method was applied to the sections. Tumoral cells showed acinar, papillary or mixed type patterns. Only 2 of 20 cases metastasized to regional lymph nodes. All OPAs were immune positive for Jaagsiekte Sheep Retrovirus Capsid Protein (JSRV CA), MDA and 8-OHdG. The control group was negative for JSRV CA, MDA and 8-OHdG expressions. Malondialdehyde and 8-OHdG immune positive cells were statistically increased in the OPA group compared to the control group. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that higher MDA and 8-OHdG expressions in sheep with OPA suggest that OPA may be closely related to lipid peroxidation and oxidative DNA damage.",

    "abstract": "Avian colibacillosis is one of the main causes of economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide. Vaccination could help to prevent infection during the laying period on broiler breeder farms. Effective vaccination against avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) may be an essential step for protection of poultry flocks depending on the region where they are raised. The aim of this study was to investigate the additive protective effect of an autogenous E. coli vaccine in broiler breeders pre-vaccinated with a licensed E. coli vaccine (Poulvac®). Our field study was partially blinded and parallel group designed. Group 1 included 24 000 laying hens vaccinated by Poulvac®. Group 2 comprised 12 000 laying hens vaccinated by Poulvac® and additionally, by an autogenous E. coli vaccine via intramuscular application before transfer. The effectiveness of vaccination in both groups was evaluated according to the results of gross pathology, bacteriology (isolation and characterization of E. coli ) and utility indicators. Based on the pathology, the occurrence of E. coli polyserositis syndrome (EPS), salpingoperitonitis syndrom (SPS), and haemorrhagic septicaemia was decreased in Group 2 compared to Group 1. The difference in the occurrence of EPS ( P &lt; 0.001) and SPS ( P = 0.0342) was significant. The proportion of serotype O78 among E. coli isolated from Group 1 and Group 2 was also significant ( P = 0.0178). The effective and multi-serotype vaccination program in order to expand heterologous protection of laying hens and combination of commercial and autogenous vaccines seems to be a promising preventive management tool.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of our study was to investigate the effects of nebulized adenosine 5'- monophosphate on airflow limitation in healthy cats determined by barometric whole body plethysmography (BWBP), in comparison to the effects of carbachol. Ten healthy 4- to 6-year-old domestic shorthair cats were included in the study. Each cat was placed in a BWBP plexiglass chamber (volume 38 l). Changes in box pressure were measured at baseline and after nebulization of vehicle and increasing concentrations of carbachol and adenosine 5'- monophosphate. Airway responsiveness was monitored as increases in enhanced pause (PENH), a unitless variable derived from dose-response curves estimating airflow limitation. The chosen endpoint was the agonist concentration which increased PENH to 300% of the value obtained after saline nebulization (PCPENH 300). Inter-day repeatability of measurements was assessed by repeated bronchoprovocations with both agonists 2-3 days apart. For carbachol, PCPENH300 was reached in all cats and correlated significantly between days (mean ± SD; 0.54 ± 0.42 mg/ml and 0.64 ± 0.45 mg/ml respectively; r = 0.58, p &lt; 0.05) In contrast, we found no reaction to adenosine 5'- monophosphate even with the highest concentration nebulized during both measurements. At baseline, mean ± SD PENH was 0.47 ± 0.18 and 0.58 ± 0.24 (measurements 1 and 2), whereas PENH after 500 mg/ml adenosine 5'- monophosphate was 0.46 ± 0.20 and 0.71 ± 0.37. All bronchoprovocation tests were well tolerated by the cats. We conclude that healthy airways in cats do not demonstrate airway responsiveness to inhaled adenosine 5'- monophosphate. This is in agreement with observations in humans as well as our previous findings in dogs, where adenosine 5'- monophosphate had no effect on healthy canine airways, but caused significant airflow limitation after induction of acute bronchitis. To define the value of bronchoprovocation testing with adenosine 5'- monophosphate in the feline respiratory tract, further investigation of this agonist in cats with spontaneous lower airway disease will be required.",

    "abstract": "The present report describes a case of fatal actinobacillosis in a dairy buffalo ( Bubalus bubalis ). Clinical signs included a large multilobular, firm abscess located caudo-ventral to the right ear base, submandiblar and prescapular lymphadenopathy, fever and dyspnoea. Haemogram revealed an accelerated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and erythropenia. Provisional diagnosis of actinobacillosis was confirmed by the demonstration of a Gram-negative pleomorphic organism in pus, microscopic examination of a compression preparation of a sulphur granule as well as growth of the organism on blood agar. Intraperitoneal inoculation of pus in guinea pigs was fatal at around 48 hours post-injection. The LD 50 of the Actinobacillus lignieresii isolate in mice was 10 4 colony forming unit per milliliter of Hank's balanced salt solution. The animal died 12 hours after the initiation of surgical drainage of the abscess and administration of iodide, antibiotics and steroids. Necropsy findings included interlobular pneumonia, pulmonary abscessation and mediastinal lympadenopathy that were ascribed to metastatic spread of the organisms to the lungs which probably led to the death of the animal. This case report appears to be the first documentation of fatal actinobacillosis in the dairy buffalo.",

Numerous aetiologies or pathophysiologies can be involved in the MMA-syndrome. Fever, anorexia, vulva discharge and mastitis are the basic changes but the growth rate and survival of the litter are the main problem of MMA. Our survey included 6 studies, of which four were entered in the meta-analysis itself; two studies dealt with the susceptibility profile of bacteria to enrofloxacin. As evident from the meta-analysis, enrofloxacin was effective in the treatment of the MMA-syndrome in pigs. Out of all studies, the results were statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.05) in three of them, whereas the overall result of metaanalysis indicates a high efficacy of enrofloxacin ( p = 0.002) in treatment of the MMA syndrome. In total, there were not more than 0.3% of less susceptible and non-resistant strains out of all surveyed strains E. coli (n = 295) within MMA-sydrome and the MIC value for E. coli ranged between 0.03 and 0.06 μg/ml. The high efficacy of enrofloxacin in the MMA-syndrome therapy has been confirmed by meta-analysis and systematic review.",

However, the equine with gastrointestinal nematodes can easily weaken and to be unable to do physical exercises, therefore researches that test the conventional anthelmintics action are necessary. The aim of this present study was to do a comparison between the action of the anthelmintic abamectin composed gel in relation to the ricobendazole, orally administered, in equine of rodeo in Mossoro city, Rio Grande do Norte state. Eight horses were divided in two groups, each one with four animals: group I treated with ricobendazole and group II treated with abamectin composed gel, they were selected through the result of the number of eggs per gram of feces (OPG) equal or over to 200 eggs, and observed for forty days. The feces were collected directly from the rectum of the animals and processed at the Animal Parasitology laboratory-UFERSA. All the studied animals presented positivity for Strongylus sp., and the abamectin composed gel presented significant reduction in the count of eggs in average of 362,5 OPG at day 0 to 12,5 at day 40.With the ricobendazole treatment it was observed low decrease in the average of the OPG of 437,5 at day 0 to 250 at day 40, however it didn't present significant result. Thus, abamectin composed gel presented better anthelmintic action in relation to ricobendazole.",

    "abstract": "Hypodynamy is the most frequently used ground-based model to study the negative consequences of microgravity on an animal organism. The objective of the current experiment was to examine the influence of hypodynamy on the growth and development of the breast muscle, thigh muscles and liver in female Japanese quail chicks from 3 to 56 d of age. Samples of muscles and liver were obtained at 1, 14, 28, 42 and 56 d; the variables studied were: weight (g), relative weight (%), dry matter (mg/g) and content of total proteins, total lipids and glycogen (mg/g). The actual weight of breast muscle, thigh muscles and liver gradually increased with age of quail in both groups. However, the experimental birds exposed to hypodynamy showed a reduction in growth relative to age-matched control. At the end of testing, the body weight of the hypodynamy group was significantly lesser than that of control ( P &lt; 0.05). The control birds had also significantly heavier breast muscle than those of experimental group. Similarly, the dry matter and total lipid content in both muscles and liver of control group was significantly increased ( P &lt; 0.05). On the contrary, the differences in the content of total protein and glycogen in muscles and liver of both groups were not significant at the end of experiment. These results provide further evidence that, although hypodynamy affects the examined variables of selected skeletal muscles and liver, the female Japanese quail is able to develop under conditions of simulated weightlessness.",

NMU was applied intraperitoneally in two doses each of 50 mg/kg b.w. between 40 - 50 postnatal days. Melatonin was administered in drinking water at a concentration of 4 μg/ml daily from 15:00 h to 8:00 h. The application was initiated 5 days prior to the fi rst NMU dose and lasted 15 days, i.e. during the promotion phase of tumour development, or long-term until the end of the experiment (week 20). Immobilization (2 h per day) began on the third day after the second carcinogen application and lasted for 7 consecutive days. Short-term MEL administration to immobilized animals increased incidence by 22%, decreased tumour frequency per animal by 26% and reduced tumour volume gain (by 21%) when compared to the immobilized group without MEL application. Decreased frequency per animal by 28% and more than a 40% decrease in tumour volume gain and cumulative volume were the most pronounced changes in the animals drinking MEL until the end of the experiment. Long-term MEL administration reduced the number and size of mammary tumours more markedly than its short-term administration. Melatonin decreased certain attributes of mammary carcinogenesis in female rats influenced by psychoemotional stress.",

Polarized light mobilizes the inadequately functioning defence mechanisms of the human body. The aim of the present experiment was to investigate the effect of LPL treatment on the udder of milking cows. Before the start of treatment, there was no significant difference between cows to be treated with LPL and the control cows in mean somatic cell counts (SCC) of milk samples taken separately by udder quarter and in the mean milk yield. The LPL treatment lasted for 20 min and was performed twice a day over a period of one month. Before treatment, the mean SCC of milk was 3.47 × 10 5 ± 910 in the group to be treated and 4.07 × 10 5 ± 920 in the control group. In a six-week period immediately after treatment, the mean SCC of the treated and the control group was 1.32 × 10 5 ± 825 and 2.63 × 10 5 ± 825, indicating a significant difference in favour of the treated group. Before the LPL treatment, the milk yield of cows in the group to be treated was 25.77 ± 1.2 kg/ day, while that of the control cows was 27.30 ± 1.4 kg/day. In a six-week period after treatment, the milk yield of cows in the treated and control groups was 28.83 ± 1.5 kg/day and 25.48 ± 1.4 kg/day, respectively. There is a significant difference between these values in favour of the treated group. The results show that a regular LPL treatment of the udder of cows can significantly reduce the SCC of milk and significantly increase the milk yield. The treatment can be applied during lactation without interfering with the milking regime.",

For this purpose, pasteurized milk was inoculated at four different levels varying between 3 to 6 log cfu ml -1 with the pathogen and its survival was determined in milk, coagulum, curd and cheese received from the production steps and at the 1st and 7th days of the storage. The heat treatment process applied after curd acidification step at 75 °C for 5 min was the most efficient barrier and greatly influenced the viability of the bacteria. Nevertheless this step was not enough to destroy all the bacteria especially when inoculated &gt; 3 log cfu ml -1 levels. For all the groups, this stage resulted in approximately 3 log decrease. Storage at 6 ± 1 °C had no influence on the viability and the count of pathogen remained nearly constant throughout storage. Results of this study indicate that neither production steps nor storage at 6 ± °C for 7 days in vacuum packages was enough to eliminate L. monocytogenes in Kashar cheese particularly if the initial level was high. Thus, in addition to the pasteurization process, hygienic measures should be taken into account to avoid possible secondary contaminations.",

The study was carried on 276 offspring of hyperprolific sows. The sows gave birth to at least 12 live-born piglets. On the first day after birth, litters were equalised to 12 piglets in litter. The body weight was examined on the 21 st (21BW), 28 th (28BW), 63 rd (63BW) and 180 th (180BW) days of life. During evaluation, the live average daily gain (LADG) from birth to day 180 of life and the average daily gain (ADG) from day 63 to day 180 of life were determined. The percentage meat content (PMC), backfat thickness (BFT) and loin eye thickness (LET) was determined using PIGLOG 105 ultrasound apparatus. Two alleles of the RYR1 gene (RYR1 C , RYR1 T ) and three genotypes (C/C, C/T and T/T) were identified. The 21BW and 28BW of the T/T genotype were significantly lower than that of the C/C and C/T. The highest PMC was characteristic of the T/T genotype, whereas the lowest one of the C/C genotype ( p ⪬ 0.05). The T/T genotype had a higher LET than the C/C genotype ( p ⪬ 0.05). No significant differences with respect to LADG, ADG and BFT between RYR1 genotypes were found. It can be stated that early identification of homozygous animals with respect to the RYR1 T gene may allow the prediction of the body weight of animals in the initial period of their rearing.",

The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of this polymorphism in the PrP gene of two Slovak autochtonous cattle breeds, namely Slovak spotted cattle (n = 89) and Slovak Pinzgau (n = 195). In the study's cohort of animals, repletion numbers 6 and 5 were found for the octapeptide repeats. We found 6/6 homozygous animals to be most prevalent (96.1%); the remaining animals were 5/6 heterozygous (3.9%). We did not observe any 5/5 homozygous animals in the studied group. This analysis included only a small group of animals. However, the results suggest that animals with six octapeptide repeats are dominant in these Slovak cattle breeds.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this experiment was to develop an effective postruminal transport system (PTS) with a high content of suitable vegetable proteins and amino acids. PTS serves for nutrient delivery to the abomasum and small intestine of dairy cows in order to increase the milk yield. Direct addition of proteins and amino acids to the diet is not useful as the ruminal microbes will utilize active substances before they reach absorption sites in the small intestine. PTS has several advantages, e.g. a possibility of the direct application in a food, low cost, and nutritional and therapeutical improvement. PTS consists of a core (pellets, small tablets) and a coating, which protects the core against the environment of rumen and enables to release the core content in the environment of abomasum and small intestine. Lenticular tablets - cores of PTS were prepared by wet granulation method and compression. Qualitative indicators of tablets (average weight, weight uniformity, hardness, friability, disintegration time) were determined according to valid Czech and European Pharmacopoeias. Cores were subsequently coated with several types of coating - ethylcellulose, stearic acid and pH sensitive polymer poly-(2-vinylpyridine-co-styren), alone or in combination of various rates. Nine samples of coated protein tablets exhibiting appropriate characteristics in vitro were prepared. The presence of the pH sensitive polymer at least in 10% concentration of the coating and the coating amount of 9.0 to 12.6% per tablet were necessary to ensure the requested PTS properties.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to test a possible extension of the period between vaccination and revaccination with the live Trichoben vaccine (Bioveta, a.s., Czech Republic). The calves (n = 61) were vaccinated intramuscularly. The intervals between vaccination and re-vaccination were 3, 5, 7, 10, 14 or 28 days. Another group of calves (n = 16) was vaccinated once with a double dose of the vaccine. The protective immunity against experimental infection with a virulent Trichophyton verrucosum CCM F-650 strain was investigated in animals one month after the last vaccination and compared with a group of non-vaccinated controls (n = 16). Clinical results were evaluated and compared using balanced two-way-ANOVA. The level of post-vaccination immunity in cattle after re-vaccination was sufficient when the intervals were 5, 7, 10, 14 and 28 days. One-time injection of a double prophylactic dose of the vaccine and a 3-day interval between vaccinations reduced the immunity and vaccine efficacy to an unsatisfactory degree. There were significant differences between the groups of calves vaccinated using an interval longer than 5 days, and the group vaccinated once with a double dose, and the group with a 3-day interval between vaccinations. The level of post-vaccination immunity in cattle after re-vaccination at the commonly used interval of 10 - 14 days was identical with the immunity achieved when the interval was reduced to 5 or 7 days or extended up to 28 days. The extension of the interval between vaccinations to 5 - 28 days is recommended for using the Trichoben vaccine in veterinary practice.",

    "abstract": "Pyodermas are among bacterial skin diseases often resisting antibiotic therapy. We therefore examined how the dogs with deep pyoderma (n = 29) respond to therapeutic effect of antibiotic cephalexins (Ceporex®, 30 mg kg -1 p.o., once a day for 9 - 11 weeks) combined with immunomodulators (Baypamune®, once a week i.m. pro toto ). The dogs with the first occurrence of pyoderma (n = 11) were treated by antibiotics alone, whereas the dogs with recurrent pyoderma (n = 18) were treated by either antibiotics alone (n = 8) or antibiotics combined with Baypamune® (n = 10). Of 11 dogs with the first occurrence of disease, 8 (73%) were successfully cured. However, only 5 of them (45%) stayed recovered after a period of two months that elapsed from the completion of therapy. Of the 8 dogs with recurrent pyoderma treated by antibiotics only, 6 (75%) recovered quickly but only 3 of them (38%) stayed healthy after 2 months elapsing from the therapy termination. Of the 10 dogs treated by antibiotics combined with immunomodulators, 8 (80%) regained health within a therapeutic period and 7 of them (70%) remained completely cured after 2 months from completion of therapy. The durations of treatment in dogs with the first occurrence of pyoderma and those with recurrent pyoderma were 8.4 and 10.5 weeks, respectively, the difference begin significant. Hair lenght and percentage of the skin area affected had no effect on the therapy duration. The disappearance of pruritus preceded the successful treatment. The results suggest that the joint treatment of deep pyodermas in dogs by antibiotics and immunomodulators may be superior to the purely antibiotic therapy, because of a stronger suppressive effect on the disease relapse.",

Therefore, studies evaluating the iron profile are necessary to elucidate this trace mineral requirements and its role in the equine exercise physiology. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of barrel racing exercise on serum iron profile of Quarter horses. Twenty-two regularly trained Quarter horses (8 females and 14 males, 4.8 ± 2.4 years old, mean body weight 431.7 ± 33.9 kg) were enrolled in this study with the owner’s informed consent. All horses were evaluated at T0 (at rest), T1 (immediately after barrel racing trial), T2 (30 min after trial) and T3 (2 h after trial). At these time points, blood samples were taken to determine the packed cell volume (PCV), red blood cell count (RBC), haemoglobin concentration (Hb), total protein (TP), serum iron (SI), total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) and transferrin saturation (TSAT). Variables were analyzed for normality through Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and comparisons were made using Tukey test, considering P &lt; 0.05. The imposed exercise challenge significantly altered PCV, RBC, haemoglobin concentration, TP, SI and TSAT, with higher values were recorded at T1. These findings can be linked to an increased demand as a result of physical activity. Significant changes occurred in the iron status in physically well-conditioned Quarter horses during the barrel racing exercise. Better understanding of iron metabolism in horses will help determine the actual necessity of supplementation.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to assess serum hyaluronic acid (HA) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) concentrations: 1) to differentiate hepatic fibrosis from other forms of liver disease, and 2) for the non-invasive staging of canine liver fibrosis. We also evaluated the association between serum HA concentration and the size of the shunt vessel as an indirect marker of decreased liver clearance in patients with single congenital vascular anomaly. Forty-one healthy client-owned dogs and forty dogs diagnosed with hepatobiliary disease were enrolled in the prospective study. Patients were divided into 4 subgroups: 1) congenital portosystemic shunts (CPSS); 2) parenchymal diseases (a. mild and moderate fibrosis, b. advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis); 3) hepatic neoplasia; 4) biliary tract disorders based on thorough clinical, ultrasound and histopathological examination. Serum HA and TGF-β1 concentrations were measured using ELISA. The HA concentration was significantly increased in patients with advanced liver fibrosis/cirrhosis ( P &lt; 0.001) and CPSS ( P &lt; 0.001) compared to healthy dogs. Using a cut-off HA concentration of 135.94 ng/ml, the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis for advanced liver fibrosis/cirrhosis was 100% (95% CI, 50.6–100) and 90.8% (95% CI, 81.6–95.7), respectively. The TGF-β1 levels did not significantly differ among groups ( P = 0.180). Negligible correlation was found between serum HA concentration and the size of portosystemic shunt vessel (rs = 0.07; P = 0.831). These findings suggest that serum HA concentration is a potential non-invasive biomarker for advanced liver fibrosis and/or cirrhosis in dogs. The utility of measuring serum concentration of TGF-β1 for diagnosing canine liver fibrosis was not supported.",

    "abstract": "This study was performed to examine the adequacy of biological inert patches as a substitute material for the construction of urinary bladder replacement tissue. An animal model experiment was conducted in six sheep and six swine. In all animals partial resection of the urinary bladder was performed; round or oval-shaped, 5–6 cm in diameter. Patches of the same shape, 4–5 cm in diameter were used. Two types of patches, polytetrafluorethylene and small intestinal submucosa were tested in the experiment, sewn with an absorbable 4-0 polydioxanone suture. Following 16 weeks the animals were euthanized followed by autopsy and histologic analysis. All animals showed evidence of bladder regeneration at the replaced segment. The patches were found to be contracted to 12–20 mm in length and 8–10 mm in width, attached to the bladder mucosa with their smaller base and protruding into the bladder lumen. In some animals, no shrunk patches were found, suggesting they had been passed out by urine. Histologically, fibrous tissue completely replacing the substitute tissue was identified with endothelial-lined luminal surface and submucosal and serosal ingrowth of new blood vessels. The replacement tissue showed no evidence of muscle layer ingrowth. Bladder capacity was also measured and no significant decrease was recorded. Our experiment demonstrated the formation of replacement tissue at the site of graft implantation, which allows the resection of a larger portion of bladder without decreasing its capacity and thus constitutes a very good method for surgical treatment of urinary bladder tumours and other defects.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory tract disease is the second most common cause of poor performance in racehorses after musculoskeletal disease. Lower respiratory tract disorders (LRTD) are common in thoroughbred horses of all ages. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there was any association between the microbiological and cytological examinations. Fifty horses ranging in age from 2 to 6 years were examined. Horses with only upper respiratory tract abnormalities identified by endoscopy (at rest) were eliminated from the study and horses with LRTD were used in this study. Tracheal aspirate specimens were collected for cytological and microbiological examinations. Thirty six horses had positive and 14 horses had negative cultivation. The isolated bacteria included β-haemolytic Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (38.8%), Escherichia coli (22.2%) and other bacteria that were isolated at rates ranging from 0.4 to 1.8%. Percentages of neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, macrophages and mast cells were evaluated in the cytological examination. The percentages of neutrophils were significantly higher in the samples with isolated bacteria (35.75 ± 2.60%) compared to the samples from which bacteria were not isolated (16.79 ± 2.36%) ( P &lt; 0.001). This study shows that S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus could play an important role in the etiopathogenesis of LRTD. It also demonstrates the importance of evaluating the microbiological findings of the tracheal aspirate specimens from horses suffering from respiratory infections, in addition to performing a detailed clinical examination and other complementary tests that focus on the respiratory system, such as endoscopy and cytology of the tracheal aspiration.",

    "abstract": "The protective effect of polysaccharide glucan in chickens fed low doses of T-2 toxin was assessed. The binder effect of β-D-glucan on jejunal mucosa in relation to the expression of Na + /K + -ATPase, proliferative activity of enterocytes and number of goblet cells was investigated. A total of 40 one-day-old chickens were allocated to four groups: control (C), β-D-glucan (G), T-2 toxin (T) and combined β-D-glucan+T-2 toxin (GT). The chickens were individually administrated per os 1.0 mg/bird/day of β-D-glucan derived from Candida albicans on days 11, 12, and 21 of the experiment (totally 3 mg per bird). T-2 toxin at a concentration of 1.45 μg·kg -1 was added to the feed from day 14 to day 28 of the experiment. The α subunit-specific anti-Na + /K + -ATPase antibody was used to identify the protein by immunofluorescence in the cell membrane of jejunal enterocytes. Higher expression of Na + /K + -ATPase was found in the jejunal epithelial cells and lamina propria in the chickens fed T-2 toxin and administered glucan ( P &lt; 0.05) compared to control. The number of proliferated enterocytes was higher in group T compared to group G and control ( P &lt; 0.001), as well group GT ( P &lt; 0.01). Goblet cell density did not present significant differences between groups of chickens, but group G showed the highest values. These data suggest that administration of pure T-2 toxin at low doses affects primarily the protein synthesis of actively dividing cells. Higher distribution of Na + /K + -ATPase in enterocytes of chickens in GT group suggests positive influence of glucan and mycotoxin on the ion pump. A binding effect of this immunomodulator on the digestive tract mucosa in the applied setup was not observed.",

Nine muscles/cuts from four groups of pigs (surgically castrated, entire males, immunocastrated and sow) were analysed. Free fatty acids (FFA) were analysed using standard methods according to CSN EN ISO 660. Thiobarbituric reactive substances (TBARS) were determined as malondialdehyde (MDA) equivalents and antioxidant capacity was evaluated by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method .

The highest content of TBARS was found in entire males; the content was significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) higher than in sows. Generally, the highest values of DPPH inhibition were detected in samples of surgically castrated pigs whereas the lowest values were observed in samples of entire males. Antioxidant capacity in musculus longissimus dorsi and backfat of surgically castrated pigs was significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) higher than in other evaluated groups of pigs. The study confirmed the differences in FFA and TBARS formation between analysed groups of pigs, probably due to differences in the fatty acid composition. The results of our study indicate that methods of castration have an effect on the antioxidant capacity of pork. These findings are of value to the meat industry.",

    "abstract": "Severe spinal cord injury (SCI) causing significant morbidity and mortality remains one of the most challenging problems in both human and veterinary medicine. Due to the restricted regeneration potential of the central nervous system (CNS) in mammals, the neurological deficit caused by spinal cord (SC) injury is permanent, and no therapeutic measures are able to completely restore neurological functions either in primates or in non-primate animals with traumatic tetraparesis/tetraplegia or paraparesis/paraplegia. The constant progress in the understanding of pathophysiologic events developing after spinal cord trauma constitute an unremitting inspiration for neuroscientists and health care professionals to test novel medicaments and treatment strategies to cope with this situation. Recent experimental studies and preclinical trials have delivered promising results. The aim of this review is a presentation of generally accepted methods of management of dogs with SCI as well as a report on new therapeutic modalities, and comment on their potential for clinical translation. The research strategy involved a search of PubMed, Medline, and ISI Web of Science from January 2010 to December 2018 using the terms “spinal cord injuryˮ and “management of spinal traumaˮ in the English language literature.

Fourteen pigs, weighing 18 to 22 kg, aged between 55 and 70 days, American Society of Anaesthesiologists classification 2, affected by congenital reducible umbilical hernia, were included in the study. Alfaxalone (5 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) mixed in the same syringe were administered into the neck muscle. Pain on injection, quality of sedation and time to achieve lateral recumbency were recorded. Heart rate (HR), respiratory frequency ( f R ), and rectal temperature (RT) were recorded at 0 (baseline: before drug administration), 10, 15, and 20 min after the injection. Oxygen saturation of haemoglobin (SpO 2 ), arterial blood pH, arterial oxygen (PaO 2 ) and carbon dioxide (PaCO 2 ) tensions and bicarbonate concentration (HCO 3 - ) were recorded at 10, 15, and 20 min after injection. Continuous data were analysed using a repeated-measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a P -value &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. Ten animals out of fourteen showed no pain on injection, whereas the remaining four exhibited mild pain. The time from the end of injection to lateral recumbency was 266 ± 40 s. The quality of sedation ranged between good to very good. No significant changes in the variables monitored were observed between the time points. In conclusion, the intramuscular administration of alfaxalone and midazolam in pigs at the doses used induced reliable and fast sedation, without pain on injection and moderate respiratory effects.",

    "abstract": "Extracts of sweet chestnut ( Castanea sativa Mill.) which contain hydrolysable tannins are used to prevent diarrhoea in farm animals due to the astringent effect of tannins. The aim of this study was to establish whether long-term treatment with the chestnut extract as a feed additive affects the acetylcholine (ACh)-triggered contractions of isolated rat ileum. Wistar rats of both sexes were divided into 4 male and 4 female groups with 6 animals in each group. The first, second and third groups of both sexes received feed with 3, 15 and 30 g of chestnut extract per kg, respectively. The fourth group of both sexes received feed without the added chestnut extract and served as the control group. After the 90-day trial, the animals were euthanized, and ilea were isolated and placed in an organ bath filled with Tyrode’s solution. Ilea were connected to an isometric transducer. Ileal contractions were triggered by 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0 and 10.0 mg of ACh, and contractions were recorded. The groups exhibited dose responsiveness to the ACh treatment steps; however, no significant differences in the contraction intensity were observed among the groups at the same ACh dose level. These results suggest that long-term treatment with chestnut extract as an astringent does not influence the intensity of ileal contractions triggered by ACh. Thus, no adverse effect on intestinal motility can be expected during a long-term use of chestnut extract as a feed additive in livestock production; however, further studies in target animal species are needed to confirm the findings.",

The study was conducted on 36 clinically healthy horses. Blood samples were taken during 60-km endurance competitions in 2014, three times in total. The study revealed an increase of lymphocytes (× 1.89-2.05; P &lt; 0.001), red blood cell count (× 1.11-1.12; P &lt; 0.001), and a decrease in the mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (× 1.20-1.27; P &lt; 0.001), red cell distribution width (× 1.11; P &lt; 0.01), platelet concentrations (× 1.33-1.40; P &lt; 0.05), when compared at the beginning and in the end of the horse endurance racing season. During the entire season, haematocrit values significantly increased after the race but were at their lowest in the mid-season period. The results proved a significant increase in the white blood cell and granulocyte counts following the finish of a 60-km endurance race, when comparing the values at the beginning and in the end of the horse endurance racing season, and a significant reduction in lymphocytes when comparing the values at the beginning (35.7%) and at the end (29.7%) of the season. The endurance competition season highly influences haematology indices in horses' blood, however, to determine the season's impact on the results of the race, additional studies must be conducted.",

    "abstract": "The study examines an analysis and evaluation of iodine content in raw cow’s milk in three regions of the Czech Republic between the years 2008 and 2018. Bulk milk samples were collected at dairy farms situated in South Bohemia, Central Bohemia, and the Vysočina Region. Iodine in milk was determined on the basis of alkaline ashing, using the spectrophotometric method according to Sandell-Kolthoff. The highest mean iodine content was measured in 2009 (485.5 ± 408.2 μg/l) and the lowest in 2016 (169.2 ± 71.7 μg/l). Since 2010 there has been a gradual decline of iodine concentration, from 479.5 ± 304.9 μg/l in 2010 to 231.2 ± 63.5 μg/l in 2018. A similar decreasing tendency was recorded in all the monitored regions. The percentage of samples containing iodine above 500 μg/l was on the decrease (37% in 2009; 0% in 2016–2018) and less than 80 μg/l (8% in 2009; 0% in 2017–2018). The current state corresponds to the requirements for iodine content in milk for human consumption. The study emphasizes the importance of continuous iodine content checks in milk and the related adjustments of iodine supplementation to the feeding rations of dairy cows.",

Firstly, the present study was designed to examine susceptibility of the corpus luteum (CL) in early diestrus in jennies; and secondly, to investigate the effect of two commonly used hormonal agents in horses on the induction of ovulation in jennies. The oestrus cycles of eleven jennies were monitored by ultrasound every day. When the dominant follicle reached a diameter of 30 mm, the jennies were treated by intramuscular administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist lecirelin (GnRH, 50 µg pro toto ) in the first oestrus cycle, and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, 1500 IU pro toto ) intramuscularly in the second oestrus cycle. Prostaglandin F 2α analogue cloprostenolum (PGF 2α , 0.125 mg pro toto ) was administered intramuscularly 2 days after the first ovulation and the interovulatory interval was monitored. This study showed that intramuscular administration of 50 µg of GnRH agonist lecirelin resulted in ovulation within 48 h in 73% of treated jennies. Intramuscular administration 1500 IU of hCG was found to be poorly effective to induce ovulation, with 36% of animals ovulating within 48 h. Intramuscular administration of PGF 2α analogue cloprostenol 2 days after ovulation was unsuccessful in attempting to shorten the interovulatory interval in donkeys.",

The study was carried out in the conditions of industrial farming. Four sows of the Large White swine breed with their litters were included in the study. Piglets were homogenously distributed into control (22) and experimental (24) groups according to weight and sex. Piglets in both groups suckled their mothers' milk. In addition, piglets in the experimental group were also fed a feed supplemented by porcine plasma protein (5%), starting on the third day post partum , whereas piglets in the control group were offered a standard pre-starter feed mixture. We recorded average daily weight gains calculated per the 27-day trial, and body weight at weaning. Clinical findings, mortality, and selected biochemical indices of protein (total immunoglobulins, total protein, albumin, creatinine, urea), and energy (glucose, total cholesterol, total lipids) metabolism were assessed as well. Results of the study showed a significant difference ( P &lt; 0.01) in average daily weight gains in the experimental group compared to the control group (0.245 kg and 0.177 kg, respectively).

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to investigate inline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) changes in clinically healthy dairy cows according to the number and stage of lactations, milk yield, and the reproduction status The LDH activity (μmol/min per litre) was measured using the dry-stick technology. A total of 378 cows were selected and classified according to their reproductive status into the following groups: fresh (1–44 days after calving); open (45–65 days after calving); inseminated (1–35 days after insemination); pregnant (35–60 days after insemination). According to their milk productivity, the cows were classified into the following groups: &lt;15 kg/d, 15–25 kg/d, &gt;25–35 kg/d, and &gt;35 kg/d. They were milked with a DeLaval milking robot in combination with a Herd Navigator analyser. The results showed that the inline LDH concentration had a tendency to increase along with the increase in the number of lactation periods ( P &lt; 0.05). The highest level of LDH was observed in fresh cows 5–10 days in milk (DIM), and the highest LDH concentration was found in the milk of fresh cows. A positive statistically reliable relationship was found between the milk yield and LDH concentration ( P &lt; 0.05); LDH and milk somatic cell counts (SCC) were positively related in all groups of cows, although LDH concentration and SCC were the highest correlated variables in inseminated cows ( P &lt; 0.05). The present study shows that measuring LDH activity in milk is both easy and cost effective with high sensitivity and specificity, having a great potential as a diagnostic tool for detection of subclinical mastitis.",

Three cats presented with localised resorption of the distal root of a mandibular molar tooth were treated by hemisection, extraction of the distal root and endodontic treatment of the mesial root. The oral function was maintained in all three cats with no clinical evidence of pain or further resorption at follow-up 10 months post treatment. One cat was also examined at 27 months post treatment, at which stage there was still no oral discomfort and the tooth appeared fine but there were radiographic signs suggestive of early apical resorption. Whilst longer term follow-up is required, it appears that hemisection may be an acceptable treatment for these localised resorptive lesions, at least for the short to medium term.",

Recently, biofortification of Se has been carried out by soil fertilization and foliar application of crops. The aim of this study was evaluate the productive traits, Se status and blood metabolic profile in fattening lambs affected by Se biofortified corn. The research was conducted with 20 Merinolandschaf lambs of the average age of 70 days, during 30 days of fattening. The feed mixture of the control group contained corn (0.014 mg Se/kg dry matter, DM); in the experimental group (Se-BC), corn was biofortified (0.278 mg Se/kg DM). The feed mixture, hay and water were offered to lambs ad libitum . Blood was collected from the jugular vein on days 0 and 30 of experiment. Haematological indices were determined in whole blood, whereas concentrations of biochemical indices, enzyme activities, and concentrations of metabolic hormones were determined in serum. After the slaughter, samples of musculus semimembranosus, liver, kidney, lungs, spleen, peritoneum and heart tissues were taken. No significant differences were obtained in productive traits when feeding lambs with Se-BC. Higher concentrations of Se in lungs and liver (control: 0.26 and 0.75 mg/kg, respectively; Se-BC: 0.33 and 0.92 mg/kg, respectively) was determined in Se-BC compared to control. Higher activity of glutathione peroxidase enzyme in serum, higher erythrocyte count, higher content of haemoglobin and haematocrit in whole blood of Se-BC lambs were determined. The results of the study indicate the posibility of using Se-BC in lambs’ diets.",

Prostaglandin F 2α + Ovsynch oestrus synchronization protocol was applied to the cows. Following the fixed time insemination (day 0), the cows were divided into 4 groups. In Group 1 (n = 42), progesterone releasing intravaginal device (PRID) was placed vaginally at 84 h and removed on the 9 th day after the artificial insemination. In Group 2 (n = 40), the cows were administered human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) on the 7 th day. Group 3 (n = 45) was applied a combination of progesterone and hCG. Group 4 (n = 42) was not given any treatment. Blood samples were collected from all cows 4 times on days 3.5, 7, 12, and 18 to evaluate progesterone concentrations. The pregnancy rates were 40.47%, 37.50%, 44.44%, and 30.95% in Group 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively ( P &gt; 0.05). In addition, in cows with progesterone concentrations &lt;2 ng/ml on day 3.5, the pregnancy rates were found to be lower than in the cows with progesterone concentrations &gt;2 ng/ml in Group 4 ( P &lt; 0.05). Progesterone supplementation in cows with progesterone concentrations &lt; 2 ng/ml appeared to increase pregnancy rates ( P &lt; 0.05) in Groups 1 and 3. As a result, post-insemination hormonal applications in the repeat breeder cows did not increase the pregnancy rate. However, it was concluded that determination of progesterone concentrations on day 3.5 following artificial insemination and then hormonal support in the cows with low concentrations would increased the pregnancy rate.",

The study was conducted on ejaculates collected from 10 boars aged 1.5–2 years. Based on sperm concentration measurements, two groups of boars were identified: Group 1 – boars providing ejaculates with a sperm concentration of at least 500 × 10 3 /mm 3 and Group 2 – boars providing ejaculates with a sperm concentration of less than 500 × 10 3 /mm 3 . Four ejaculates were collected manually from each boar. Each ejaculate was diluted with Biosolvens Plus diluent, and insemination doses were prepared and stored at 17 °C. Mitochondrial membrane potential and motility of spermatozoa were evaluated at each insemination dose. The tests were carried out after 1, 24, 48, 96 and 168 h of storage. Based on the results, it was found that ejaculates with a sperm concentration ≥ 500 × 10 3 /mm 3 have a lower share of spermatozoa with high mitochondrial membrane potential than ejaculates with a sperm concentration below 500 × 10 3 /mm 3 . A high correlation between the share of spermatozoa with a high mitochondrial membrane potential and motility of spermatozoa was demonstrated in the first 24 h and after 96 h of semen storage, which was confirmed by the calculated phenotypic correlation coefficients. Sperm cells in ejaculates with a higher sperm concentration are more sensitive to storage time than spermatozoa in ejaculates with a lower concentration.",

This study aimed to do a retrospective evaluation of 274 medical records of dogs with external otitis treated at the “Dr Halim Atique” Hospital during the period of January 2006 to August 2010. It was performed the analysis of paper and electronic records in way to examine the influence of sex, age and breed of animals in external otitis. After that, it was done the description of etiologic agents and sensibility test for antimicrobials. Two hundred and fourteen cultures were positive (78.68%) for the growth of microorganisms, and 60 (21.32%) were negative. Regarding to culture growth, the frequency of Staphylococcus spp. was 47.08%; Proteus spp. of 14.39%; Pseudomonas spp. 13.23%; 10.31% of Escherichia coli and others. Bigger bacterial isolation was described in the age group of 0-3 years (p = 0.059), accounting for 89 cases (32.04%). Regarding the breed, 59 (21.24%) were mongrel dogs and 40 Poodles (14.40%). There was no statistical difference between the microorganism isolation and the sex. The distribution of external otitis according to sex and monomicrobial infection in females was of 113 cases (41.22%) and 63 males (22.97%). Monomicrobial infection was significantly higher compared to polymicrobial (p < 0.0001). There was a higher sensitivity, a statistically significant of Staphylococcus spp., cephalexin (60.86%), ciprofloxacin (59,09%) and enrofloxacin (59,09%) were statistically significant compared to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (16.66%).\r\n\r\nKeywords: External otitis, dogs, Staphylococcus spp.",

Seven measurements of the hoof were taken: angle at the toe, lateral and medial heel length, toe length, frog length and width, and length and width of sole. From these measurements the following hoof problems could be identified: 32 out of 50 horses (64%) had contracted heels, 15 (30%) had medial to lateral hoof imbalance, and 27 (54%) had asymmetry of hoof. The difference of toe angle among contralateral members was not significant, however, some horses presented difference among the angle of the opposite forelimb, varying from the degree 1 to the 2, and foot contraction varied from 40 to 64% to the different studied members. The high frequency of hoof abnormalities in this population of horses suggests that trimming and shoeing practices employed should be reviewed and improved. \r\n\r\nKeywords: Equine, hoof balance, trimming, lameness",

It is known that the amount of parasites can affect the survival and the reproductive performance of the parasited animals. Most of the studies on helminthes have been addressed for the taxonomy of those parasites. In this study, capybaras were captured through the construction of snares (after obtaining permission of Ibama/AC), in order to guarantee the number of individuals wanted in the breeding stock, composed by seven adults and five cubs animals, where the adults were distributed like this: a male and six females, belonging to the same group, which were identified with microchips and also weighted. Those animals were conditioned in a picket, composed by dam area, bushes and natural vegetation (shelters). The feces analyses were achieved by Willis Molay technique (fluctuation) five days after the birth, and monthly in the first three months of animal lifespan. The no-parametric test of the Sign was applied (Siegel & Castellan Junior, 2006) for the variable infestation degree. Great parasitic infestations are observed in the period of the rains, in the capybaras livestock, in semi-extensive system, committing the breeding of adult animals and mainly of nestlings. It takes advice six anthelmintic treatments a year, every two months for the adult animals and regarding the young of animals one week after the birth, and about one month after the second anthelmintic treatment.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Wild animals, anthelminthic treatment, intestinal parasites",

Udder myoelectrical activity was measured on 10 healthy highly productive dairy cows of Slovak Pied cattle breed. The electrical activity of four quarters of the udder was recorded simultaneously using four bipolar electrodes. The udder was stimulated by delicate two-finger massage, manual milking and mechanical milking. During the experiment the duration of the reaction for stimulation and the amplitude of spike dischargers were listed. The udder stimulation through palpational massage of the teat end, manual and mechanical milking caused immediate reaction. The udder responded to stimulation with an increase in myoelectrical activity: increase in discharge frequency to 2.33 ± 0.6 per min and an increase in discharge amplitude with the average of 457 ± 147 µV. The average count of spike discharges was 3.86 ± 0.97, the average duration of the action potential was 8.12 ± 1.68 s and the average myoelectrical index was 31 ± 4%. Manual milking caused the highest increase in the udder myoelectrical activity. Evaluation of the mammary gland myoelectrical activity may provide an alternative method to study milk ejection disorders and to diagnose mastitis.",

Blood samples were obtained from six groups of horses comprising a total of 119 horses (75 males and 44 females, 5–15 years old) with laminitis, acute abdominal syndrome, acute diseases, chronic diseases, after castration and healthy control. Hormone concentrations in serum were determined for each group using competitive enzyme immunoassay. Significant increases compared to control were found for dehydroepiandrosterone in horses with castration ( P &lt; 0.01), acute abdominal syndrome and acute diseases ( P &lt; 0.05). Besides, significant increases were observed for androstenedione in horses with laminitis, castration and acute diseases ( P &lt; 0.01), and in acute abdominal syndrome and chronic diseases ( P &lt; 0.05). Significant increases were also found for testosterone in horses with castration ( P &lt; 0.01) and with laminitis, acute abdominal syndrome and chronic diseases ( P &lt; 0.05). The lowest values of testosterone were found in the control group. Compared to control, 17b-oestradiol serum concentrations showed significant decreases ( P &lt; 0.01) in horses with laminitis, acute abdominal syndrome, acute and chronic diseases.

Fourteen healthy thirteen-month-old cats of both sexes were immobilized by TZXT or TZX on two different occasions. The cats’ scores for immobilization, analgesia and baseline physiological indicators, heart rate, respiratory rate and rectal temperature, were recorded before and 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100 and 120 min after administration of TZXT or TZX. Animals in both groups became laterally recumbent within 3 min and physiological indicators changed after administration. These changes were within biologically acceptable limits; these measurements did not differ between the treatments. Induction and recovery quality in animals was better with TZXT than with TZX. Sedation, analgesia, muscle relaxation and posture scores was higher in TZXT group. During recovery, cats in TZXT group were more conscious than cats in TZX group. This study showed that in cats, addition of tramadol (T) to TZX improved the quality of anaesthetic induction and increased the analgesic effect without adversely affecting the physiological indicators. Thus tiletamine/zolazepam-xylazine-tramadol shows to be more suitable for cat anaesthesia.",

Clinical signs were firstly observed on November 2001 in sheep in Konavle, Dubrovnik – Neretva County. During this epizootic the overall sheep morbidity and mortality were 5.2% (95% confidence interval (c.i.), 4.1-6.6%) and 2.29% (95% c.i., 1.6-3.3%), respectively. After the outbreak, 3,318 serum samples of ruminants from 53 villages of the Dubrovnik – Neretva County were examined for bluetongue virus (BTV) antibodies by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA). In forty nine (92.45%, 95% c.i., 82.11-96.92%) of the 53 villages, animals with antibodies against bluetongue virus were found. In particular, a total of 178 cattle (49.86%, 95% c.i., 44.7-55.0%), 174 sheep (13.72%, 95% c.i., 11.9-15.7%) and 270 goats (15.95%, 95% c.i., 14.3-17.8%) were seropositive. Antibodies to bluetongue virus serotype 9 were detected in 212 positive sera by serum neutralization test. The percentage of positive animals decreased ( P &gt; 0.05) from the east to the west suggesting a possible east westward spreading of BTV infection. Fourteen light-trap midge collections from seven different sites were examined. Of the 4872 Culicoides spp. collected, 4,492 (92%, 95% c.i., 91.4-92.9%) of them belonged to the species of Obsoletus complex . This study showed for the first time that a pathogenic strain of BTV-9, probably from Montenegro, entered Croatia causing disease and death in local sheep and that C. obsoletus and C. scoticus were likely the major vectors of infection.",

Fistulas located in tissues surrounding the anus are usually described in the course of furunculosis in dogs. This study presents the case of a one-year-old cat in which two rectocutaneous fistulas had formed. This process was a result of the chronic inflammation of tissues around the base of the tail due to the drainage of an abscess. The animal was referred for radiological examination with clinical signs of dyschezia. Faecal material was discharged only through the fistulas situated on both sides of the tail. The aim of the radiological examination was to preoperatively determine the course of the fistula tract and to identify their internal openings. Fistulography revealed that both fistulas were connected with each other and with the rectal lumen. Their external opening was located at the height of the 4 th caudal vertebra, 1.5 cm (fistula on the right) and 2 cm (fistula on the left) from the wall of the rectum. The fistula located on the right side branched cranially. The rectal lumen in this area was significantly narrowed. Abscess formation resulting in the development of rectocutaneous fistulas has not yet been described in dogs or cats. In the present case, fistulography made it possible to identify directly the source and course of the fistula canal. This examination should be complemented by other diagnostic modalities, such as a contrast examination of the gastrointerstinal tract, ultrasound evaluation, and magnetic resonance imaging.",

The compliance with legal requirements (Regulation EC No 1924/2006) and information stated on the product was checked.This study is the first one in the Czech Republic dealing with this issue. Among hundreds of marketed MPs, we observed only a limited number of MPs bearing claims. We analysed and compared chemical composition of 12 MPs bearing nutrition claims to 5 identical brand products without any claim. None of the claims dealt with reduced amount of Na/salt content and none was evaluated as an explicit health claim. Most of the mentioned nutrition claims were declared as “Fit, Fitness, Light, Wellness, With low/reduced fat”. Only one claim mentioned “ω3 FA addition”. All analytical results, except one product with claim “Low/reduced fat” or “Light” (if connected with fat reduction), corresponded to the legal requirements and information stated on the product. Three statements on the products associated with Na/salt content did not correspond to the amount measured in the sample. When comparing MPs “with” and “without” nutrition claim, lightly reduced fat or added amount of ω3 FA was recognized only in one product with claim. Other indicators, such as Na/salt content, better FA profile or more evident fat reduction were not found. The results of our study show that claims such as “Healthier, Fit, Fitness or Wellness” may be considered as somewhat misleading for consumers.",

After sampling, kidney sections of experimental and control animals were evaluated. Under a light and electron microscope the diffuse degenerative changes in kidney cortex and medulla were noted. Light microscopy revealed that the renal corpuscles had normal structure, but other nephron components and the collecting ducts were invariably changed. The epithelial cells inside the proximal and distal tubules and collecting ducts possessed increased quantity of cytoplasmic vacuoles and some tubular sections showed cellular sloughing and necrotization. The cells within the thin limbs of the Henley’s loops had normal histological structure except for sporadic necrotizing cells within some segments. The ultrastructural evaluation showed extensive cytoplasmic vacuolisation and degenerative changes, such as mitochondrial swelling and shortening of basal infoldings within proximal and distal tubules, and microvilli reduction within proximal tubules. Cells of the collecting tubules exhibited a higher number of vacuoles and some cells had apparently reduced organelles. The cells of the thin limbs of the Henle’s loop showed more vacuolised cytoplasm, some tubular sections revealed cellular detachment between the adjacent epithelial cells and rare necrotising epithelial cells were observed.

    "abstract": "This study was carried out to determine the usefulness of standard electrocardiography for the diagnosis of early canine heartworm disease. Baseline electrocardiograms were recorded in 12 dogs. Thirty artificial Dirofilaria immitis worms were inserted in the pulmonary artery of each dog. New electrocardiograms were recorded on days 1-4, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 after insertion of worms. A significant attenuation of amplitude of Q wave in lead I was recorded on days 1-4, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35; of R wave in lead II on days 21, 28 and 35; and of S wave in lead aVR on days 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35. Duration of the QRS complex in lead AVF was significantly prolonged on day 14. In 41.6% of the dogs, right axis deviation was recorded. These results suggest that for a dog whose normal baseline standard electrocardiogram is known, a comparison of the QRS complex of the baseline with those of subsequent standard electrocardiograms may suggest early canine heartworm disease when there is an attenuation of amplitude of Q wave in lead I, R wave in lead II and S wave in lead aVR. An additional indication can be right axis deviation.",

At clinical examination food or liquid regurgitation episodes were reported at different times after food ingestion. The esophagus was visualized with the videoendoscope and then examined on liquid barium sulphate. The assessment revealed the existence of two cervically and mediastinally (intrathoracically) located dilatations. The surgical procedure was based on polyester vascular prostheses also used in human vascular surgery. The surgery was performed in two stages with a 4 week interval in between, without the resection of the dilated walls, with the prostheses positioned and fixed in different ways and with very good post surgery recovery. Eleven months after the surgery the dog’s health condition was very good. To our knowledge, this is the first report about these procedures which avoid the resection of a portion of the esophagus wall, thus preventing the occurrence of scars or strictures at this level, and prostheses increase the support and stability of the affected esophagus portion.",

When evaluating the nitrogenous substances, their determination was based on the content of pure protein (sum of amino acids) which is more accurate than crude protein. There were differences in the chemical composition of dry matter from pasture vegetation and horse excrements. Regarding crude fat, crude fibre, acid detergent fibre, neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent lignin, ash, P and Mg, the average values in dry matter of horse excrements were significantly ( P ≤ 0.01) higher; on the contrary, we found significantly ( P ≤ 0.01) lower mean values of nitrogen-free extract, organic matter and Ca ​​in the dry mass of pasture grass. The highest coefficient of apparent digestibility for organic nutrients was determined in the nitrogen-free extract (73%) followed with organic matter (71%), pure protein (68%), crude protein (65%) and crude fat (61%). In case of fibre and its fractions, the apparent digestibility coefficients decreased as follows: crude fibre (66%), neutral detergent fibre (66%), acid detergent fibre (63%) and acid detergent lignin (42%). Significantly lower values were determined for coefficients of apparent digestibility for minerals P (16%) and Mg (50%), which highlights the need for their regular supplementation in horses on pasture. This study extends the current state of knowledge regarding the apparent digestibility of pasture vegetation which is a prerequisite for optimal nutrition of horses.",

Toad species of the genus Bufo are among those susceptible to infection by the pathogen in Europe. The aim of this study was to observe the presence and impact of infection in adults of two toad species collected for captive breeding. The total number of animals included in the study was 162, but only subsets were used for sampling at different occasions (35 specimens in the initial sampling in summer 2011, 48 post hibernation during winter 2011, and 31 in summer 2012, after all toads in captivity were treated with itraconazole). We performed TaqMan real-time quantification PCR to detect and quantify the pathogen. We found that a large infection load was linked to mortality in a single adult green toad ( Bufo viridis) . However, low infection loads observed in five B. viridis and five natterjack toads ( B. calamita) were lost over time, with no apparent adverse effect. Intraconazole treated animals were all clear of infection. As infection in these two toad species either led to mortality or recovery, it seems unlikely they could act as permanent carriers of B. dendrobatidis and therefore persistence of the pathogen is likely maintained by different host species. This is the first study to date that has detected infection and observed its impact and persistence in wild-infected toads in Europe.",

A total of 14 eight-month-old Chinese experimental miniature pigs were used in this study. Tiletamine-zolazepam (3.5 mg·kg -1 ), xylazine (1.32 mg·kg -1 ) and tramadol (1.8 mg·kg -1 ) were administered i.m.; blood pressure and heart rate were recorded. At the same time, blood was collected through precaval vein, and nitric oxide, endothelin, 6-keto-PGF 1α and thromboxanes B 2 were determined by colorimetry and radioimmunoassay. The mean times to dorsal recumbency, duration of immobilization, standing and walking were 2.26 ± 0.72, 87.57 ± 9.61, 25.63 ± 12.55 and 36.70 ± 14.53 min, respectively. Blood pressure was significantly changed at 10 and 80 min ( P &lt; 0.01), and the heart rate ranged from 89 to 134 bpm without episodes of severe bradycardia or tachycardia. Significantly positive correlation was observed between endothelin, thromboxanes B 2 and blood pressure as well as the heart rate ( P &lt; 0.05). There was negative correlation between PGI 2 and blood pressure as well as heart rate ( P &lt; 0.05). The results showed that endothelin, 6-keto-PGF 1α and thromboxanes B 2 participated in the changing of cardiopulmonary parameters which were caused by tiletamine-zolazepam-xylazine-tramadol anaesthesia in miniature pigs, and the 6-keto-PGF 1α , ET and TXB 2 concentrations in plasma participated in the changing of blood pressures during anaesthesia. Therefore, we can recommend tiletamine-zolazepam/xylazine/tramadol for anaesthesia in pigs, and this study also contributes to the evaluation of the effect of endothelium-derived vasoactive factors during anaesthesia.",

The aim of this study was to describe a rare case of sternal (pectoral) ectopia cordis in a calf. A female calf of the Limousin breed born in Poland in 2011 was subjected to euthanasia because the heart was situated outside the chest. The carcass of the calf was subjected to anatomical examination in which alterations in cardiovascular system and in the structure of the sternum were observed. Cytogenetic studies were performed to find out if the karyotype of the calf was normal. Elongation of the ascending aorta was observed and the pattern of aortic branching was aberrant similarly to that found in dogs, not cattle. The systemic circulation was found to be linked to pulmonary circulation due to persisting large calibre arterial duct. Each of the ventricles had its own cardiac apex and walls of the ventricles manifested a similar width. The atria were slightly altered. A single, short and dilated blood vessel (pulmonary vein) evacuated its content to the left atrium. Pericardium formed no pericardial sac. Radiogram of the sternum demonstrated a ring-resembling shape and 12 (6 pairs) cartilaginous bars of the sternum (sternebrae). A normal female karytotype (60, XX) indicated that this malformation was not caused by an abnormal number of chromosomes (aneuploidy).",

The study was conducted on ewes (n = 12) and gimmers (n = 12) of Sumava mountain sheep; each group was subdivided into two groups (group A and B) of six animals. Feed of group A was supplemented with 3 mg iodine/kg of dry matter; group B was given 5 mg iodine/kg dry matter. The iodine in feed mineral supplement was in the form of calcium iodide. The ewes were at first carrying, subsequently lambing, lactating and finally remained barren. The experiment ended after 11 months, when all animals were slaughtered and a sample of the thyroid gland was taken for histometric examination and determination of iodine content by modified colorimetric method. Prior to the slaughter, blood samples were collected for determination of thyroidal hormones and the thyroid-stimulating hormone in blood serum. Thyroid glands of sheep from group B showed higher thyroid weight, larger follicles, higher percentage of large follicles and lower follicular cells compared to groups A. Normal or lower content of triiodothyronine and thyroxine, lower content of their free fractions and bordering or elevated concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone were detected in blood serum of all four groups. This trend can signalize the tendency of lowering activity of the thyroid gland. The results of this long-term study show impacts of higher iodine intake on the structure and function of the thyroid gland in sheep.",

Post-vaccination examination of blood serum for antibodies against L. intracellularis in sucklings in experimental and control groups was negative, probably due to insufficiently long period of rejection of antibiotics-medicated feedstuff and by chlorinated water. With the exception of immunological profile, no essential changes were recorded in the dynamics of other indices of examined profiles in groups of sows in relation to immune-modulation. In groups of sucklings from sows fed beta-glucan supplemented feedstuff significant changes were determined for various indices compared with sucklings from sows fed standard foodstuff.

The study describes two cases of undesirable heterofermentation in dry sausages from two different producers. In the sausage samples (n = 7) the pH value and the content of lactic and acetic acids were measured. Microbial analysis focused on quantitative and qualitative detection of lactic acid bacteria. The acetic acid content varied from 24.28 to 67.41 µmol·g -1 dry matter, in the case of samples from the second producer the content of acetic acid (48.45 to 67.41 µmol·g -1 dry matter) was higher than the lactic acid content (20.98 to 29.02 µmol·g -1 dry matter). The lactobacilli strains from the sausages were assigned to the corresponding species by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization – Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and classified to three groups according to the sugar fermentation pattern (obligately homofermentative, facultatively heterofermentative and obligately heterofermentative) and they caused the heterofermentation process in the samples of dry fermented sausages. The description of the case of heterofermentation process in dry sausages is unique and there is little information about this topic.",

The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript in the outlet wall of the abomasum of bulls with different daily weight gains. The study was performed on 15 bulls, breed crosses of local black and white milk cattle and Limousin bulls. The animals were slaughtered at the mean age of 543–549 days and body weight of 441.0–491.4 kg. Fragments of the outlet wall of the abomasum were sampled for analyses during routine slaughter. Immunohistochemical assays showed that slowly growing bulls (803 g/day) had significantly ( P ≤ 0.05) fewer positive structures of cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (by 1.65 × on average) compared to bulls with large daily weight gains (905 g/day). This tendency was also observed in the case of cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript distribution in particular layers of the abomasum wall. The most numerous positive structures of cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript were found in the nerve fibres of the muscularis and in the muscle plexus, whereas they were evidently less numerous in the submucous plexus. Our results suggest that the number of cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript immunopositive structures is associated with the growth intensity of the animals, and frequent occurrence of this neuropeptide in the nerve fibres and the muscular plexus proves its role in the control of stomach emptying.",

Biogenic amine concentrations in breast and thigh muscles were analysed by reverse phase liquid chromatography. In the thigh muscle, the highest increases during the storage time were found in cadaverine (20.17 ± 18.66 mg/kg), putrescine (4.39 ± 4.17 mg/kg) and tyramine (15.20 ± 16.88 mg/kg) concentrations. Changes of biogenic amine concentrations in the breast muscle were minimal during the whole storage time. The concentration of biogenic amines in meat is associated with the presence of contaminating microorganisms. For that reason, biogenic amines are often used as markers of meat spoilage in various livestock species. Based on our results, the biogenic amines cadaverine, putrescine and tyramine may be considered the main indicators of hygienic quality of pheasant meat. We can recommend storing pithed pheasants treated by evisceration no longer than for seven days at 7 °C. After that period, biogenic amine concentrations in meat begin to change. The main significance of this study lies in the extension of the lack information about the content of biogenic amines in the meat of eviscerated pithed pheasant and also about changes of their concentrations during the course of storage.",

A significant increase of lethality was observed after 48, 72 and 96 h of exposure to only azoxystrobin, but also in the group exposed to the combined effect of azoxystrobin and glyphosate at all time intervals. On the other hand, a significant decrease of lethality was observed in those groups exposed to ionizing radiation even at the dose of 30 Gy at all time intervals compared to non-irradiated groups. These results confirm the toxicity of azoxystrobin to aquatic organisms; non-toxicity of glyphosate to crustaceans and support the theory of radiation hormesis at the level of 30 Gy radiation dose.",

Significant interdependence was found between the number of CART structures and carcass adiposity and the fat content of the longissimus lumborum muscle. The identified tendency for fat tissue increase in the carcasses was accompanied by a lower concentration of the structures. In the endocrine system cell the greatest number of immunopositive cells were found; ranging from 28.9 in animals more obese to 37.8 with the smallest amount of fat accumulated. The lowest numbers of immunopositive cells, ranging from 2.4 to 3.9 were noted in the submucous plexus layer. Slightly more structures were observed in nerve fibres and the myenteric plexus, at 2.9 and 4.7, respectively. The number of CART in the endocrine system was correlated with subcutaneous fat (-0.451) and marbling (-0.514). The amount of CART in these anatomical layers was significantly correlated with the thickness of subcutaneous fat (-0.541 and -0.636) and the weight of perinephric fat (-0.487 and -0.672). The results confirm that CART is an important neurotransmitter that participates in the regulation of fat deposition in the body. It must be stressed that the correlations with the analysed fat deposition indices concerned the adiposity indicators influencing the commercial value of carcasses and the meat traits important to the consumer.",

    "abstract": "Biochemical analysis in horses is an important aid for determining correct clinical diagnosis of general, infectious, and some parasitic diseases. This work studied the biochemical and mineral indices in mares of two breeds: the Norik breed Muráň Plain type and the Hucul breed. A total of 34 mares of the Norik breed Muráň Plain type (aged 15.18 ± 5.99 years) and 28 Hucul mares (aged 9.03 ± 5.50 years) were used. Blood serum was analysed using the biochemical analyser Cobas c111 (Roche, Switzerland). Significant difference ( P &lt; 0.05) was found between the Norik breed Muráň Plain type and the Hucul mares in aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase and gamma-glutamyltransferase activity; significant difference ( P &lt; 0.01) was found in urea values; and highly significant difference ( P &lt; 0.001) was found in glucose values. The mineral profile elements showed a highly significant differences ( P &lt; 0.001) between the Norik breed Muráň Plain type and the Hucul mares in phosphorus, magnesium, iron, chloride, potassium, and sodium concentrations. The results confirmed that there are significant differences between horse breeds in some biochemical indices. Therefore, it is appropriate to determine reference values for other horse breeds, as well. To our knowledge, this is the first report that compares biochemical and mineral indices between the Norik breed Muráň Plain type and the Hucul breed.",

The experiment was carried out on 360 turkey hens (6 groups). The groups C and C+stress were the control groups and did not receive any additive. Birds from the groups A and A+stress were administered aloe extract at the amount of 0.70 ml/kg body weight (bw)/day. The turkey hens from the groups T and T+stress received 5-oxo-1,2,4-triazine at the amount of 30 μg/kg bw/day. The additives were administered in the birds’ drinking water twice for 28 days (days 36–63 and 78–105) of the birds’ life. On days 61–63 and 103–105 a stress factor (simultaneous crowding and a change in temperature and lighting) was introduced in the groups C+stress, A+stress and T+stress for 1 hour a day. The results showed that the applied stress factors caused a significant ( P ≤ 0.05) decrease in the lysozyme level and % phagocytic cells, as well as a non-significant reduction in the metabolic activity of heterophils. Under the influence of stress an increase ( P ≤ 0.05) in the percentage of monocytes and basophils was observed. The use of aloe preparation improved some indicators of immunity (increased, P ≤ 0.05, lysozyme and % phagocytic cells) in the turkey hens. To alleviate the negative effect of stress on immune reactions, supplementation of diets with aloe extract supplemented with resveratrol and vitamin C may be considered.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the case of a six year-old, male, thoroughbred horse with clinical signs of inappetence, weakness, and incoordination when walking. Clinical examination showed that the horse staggered and leaned to the left side. Feedstuff was present inside and around its mouth. Salivation was increased and there was no reflex at the palpebrae and tongue. The horse had difficulty swallowing and the tone of its tail was reduced. Botulism was diagnosed based on the clinical signs. Antibiotic (ceftiofur) and fluid-electrolyte treatment was commenced. Next day, neostigmin was added to the horse’s treatment, and it became recumbent. The horse’s palpebral, tongue and tail reflexes returned partially after neostigmine methylsulphate treatment on the same day and it stood up on day four. However, it could not swallow anything during the whole week, so after getting permission from the owner, the horse was euthanized on day 10. Samples of the colonic content and blood serum were sent by courier to the laboratory for toxin neutralization, however, botulinum neurotoxins could not be detected. After that, serum samples from days 6 and 10 were sent to another laboratory for testing for botulinum neurotoxin antibodies by ELISA. Specific antibodies against botulinum neurotoxin type A were measured, indicating a previous, immuno-relevant contact with the toxin. This seroconversion for type A supports the clinical botulism diagnosis. Type A botulism is rarely seen in Europe and has been detected in a horse in Turkey for the first time.",

    "abstract": "Irreversible electroporation is a local, non-thermal ablation method, where short electrical pulses of high voltage lead to changes in cell membrane permeability and cell death. Recent experimental studies have shown that it does not lead to damage of blood vessels, nerves, bile duct or ureters. The aim of our experimental study was to evaluate the negative effect of irreversible electroporation regarding damage to the vascular wall and porcine pancreatic tissue. Irreversible electroporation of the pancreas was performed in 6 pigs after medial laparotomy. Irreversible electroporation was applied to each pig to the splenic lobe of the pancreas in order to assess damage to the pancreatic tissue and to the duodenal lobe of the pancreas to assess damage to the vascular structure of the pancreatic tissue. Higher ablation electric intensity (minimum 500 V/cm – maximum 1,750 V/cm, step 250 V/cm) in 90 μs pulses was utilized on each pig. After 7 days, macroscopic and microscopic evaluations of en bloc resected specimen (pancreas with duodenum) were performed. During 7 post-ablation days, no deaths or clinical worsening occurred in any of the pigs. Necrotic changes in the pancreatic tissue were recorded at an electric intensity of 750 V/cm. Changes in the outer layers of the wall of the arteries and veins occurred at 1,000 V/cm. Transmural vascular wall damage was not recorded in any case. Irreversible electroporation allows for relatively efficient cell death in the target tissues. Our independent experimental work confirms the safety of this method towards vascular structures located in the ablation zone.",

It is acquired by the ingestion of embryonated parasite eggs; the ingestion of meat from animals carrying cystic larvae plays a central role in this disease. The study was conducted in Ayapango, Mexico. Ninety-two sheep where used, of which 72 were females and 20 males. The total prevalence of anti- Toxocara antibodies was 15.21% (14/92), ranging from 17.24% in the one to six months age group to 14.28% in the group older sheep six months, with a higher percentage in females (19.44%) compared to males (5.0%), with a significant difference between positive males and females older than six months of age (Chi-square test = 4.22, P &lt; 0.05). The prevalence of anti- Toxocara antibodies in sheep suggests that a high number of animals are infected with Toxocara spp. The consumption of meat from paratenic hosts, including sheep, is considered a means of transmission of toxocariasis to humans.",

Traditionally, bolus administration of furosemide is the treatment of choice. However, there is emerging information that continuous rate infusion might be more effective than bolus injections in relieving clinical signs and producing a lower rate of complications such as azotaemia, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances. We tested the effect of furosemide both in bolus (4–6 mg/kg intravenously) and continuous rate infusion (1 mg/kg/h) in 30 dogs that had been presented with fulminant pulmonary oedema during 2 days of hospitalization. No differences in the selected biochemical indicators between the groups were found. There were significant differences in blood urea nitrogen in the bolus injection group and creatinine and phosphorus in the continuous rate infusion group between days 1 and 2. The results of this study showed no differences in the approach of furosemide administration in the management of pulmonary oedema. Both methods may cause renal and electrolyte complications, however, further studies with a larger number of patients are recommended.",

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of monosodium glutamate administered parenterally to rats on the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein, S-100β protein and Ki-67 antigen in the satellite glial cells. Adult, 60-day-old male rats received monosodium glutamate at two doses of 2 g/kg b.w. (group 1) and 4 g/kg b.w. (group 2) subcutaneously for 3 consecutive days. Animals in the control group (group C) were treated with corresponding doses of 0.9% sodium chloride. Immediately after euthanasia, spinal ganglia of the lumbar region were dissected. Immunohistochemical peroxidase anti-peroxidase reactions were performed on the sections containing the examined material using antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein, S-100β and Ki-67. Next, morphological and morphometric analyses of immunopositive and immunonegative glia were conducted. The data were presented as the mean number of cells with standard deviation. Significant differences were analysed using ANOVA ( P &lt; 0.05). In all 63-day-old rats, immunopositivity for the examined proteins glia was observed. Increased number of cells expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein was demonstrated in group 2, whereas the number of S-100β-positive glia grew in the groups with the increasing doses of monosodium glutamate. The results indicate the early stage reactivity of glia in response to increased levels of glutamate in the extracellular space. These changes may be of a neuroprotective nature under the conditions of excitotoxicity induced by the action of this excitatory neurotransmitter.",

Em regioes temperadas, a duracao do dia e o fator extrinseco primario responsavel por ativar o eixo hipotalâmico-hipofisario-gonadal e determinar a dinâmica reprodutiva das aves, estabelecendo um ciclo reprodutivo anual, que se divide em sucessivas fases (sensibilidade, estimulacao e refratariedade) ao longo do ano. Em regioes aridas e semiaridas, a disponibilidade de comida e a periodicidade das chuvas sao os principais fatores ambientais que determinam a dinâmica reprodutiva das aves. O controle e a sincronizacao das fases do ciclo reprodutivo das aves sao determinados pela acao de hormonios sexuais e nao sexuais, sendo a prolactina e o hormonio luteinizante os principais envolvidos neste fenomeno, mediante secrecao fotoinduzida.

    "abstract": "Pteridium aquilinum ou samambaia do campo, como e conhecida popularmente, esta presente na maioria das propriedades rurais de criacao extensiva e semi – extensiva do mundo. Sua presenca esta relacionada com a intoxicacao aguda denominada hematuria enzootica, apos ingestao de grandes quantidades em pouco tempo. Possui relacao, tambem, com a presenca de neoplasias de trato digestorio superior quando ingerida constantemente por longos periodos. As alteracoes por cronicidade de ingestao estao ligadas ao principio toxico mais importante do Pteridium, o ptaquilosideo, um agente cancerigeno distribuido por toda estrutura vegetal. Este atua de forma deleteria quando consumido, tanto in natura quanto seco. Seus brotos e rizomas contem as maiores concentracoes toxicas sendo os mais procurados para compor pratos culinarios, principalmente no Japao aonde e comum encontrar brotos em conserva. Estudos demonstraram que este metabolito e liberado no leite de vacas que pastam constantemente em terrenos com a presenca da samambaia. Sabe-se que a liberacao no leite se inicia apos 38 horas do consumo da samambaia e cessa somente depois de dois dias sem a ingestao. Assim sendo, pode ser considerado um agente de importância para saude publica humana e veterinaria. A quantidade de planta ou leite ingerido e o ponto crucial para estabelecer o desenvolvimento neoplasico a curto ou longo prazo do trato digestorio superior, principalmente esofago e estomago. Mesmo apos o processo de pasteurizacao, ha volume efetivo de ptaquilosideo para causar danos. Este fato se deve a capacidade do metabolito em alterar permanentemente genes ligados a apoptose celular e supressao de tumores.\r\n\r\nPalavras-Chave: Ruminantes, saude publica, samambaia, intoxicacao.",

A mensuracao do diâmetro dos halos hemoliticos indicou producao de uma grande quantidade de toxina. Alem disso, a maioria das amostras (70,5%) demonstrou atividade hemolitica as 24 horas de incubacao.

    "abstract": "No meio ambiente, tanto fungos filamentosos quanto leveduras podem desencadear micoses em humanos, e em outros animais. Com o objetivo de verificar a ocorrencia e fatores de patogenicidade de fungos em lesoes de animais do Parque Zoologico de Dois Irmaos foram coletados especimes clinicos da regiao superior das patas traseiras das lhamas (Lama glama). De cada lhama foram realizadas seis coletas, tres dos pelos e tres das escamas epidermicas. Para o exame direto, os especimes clinicos foram clarificados com hidroxido de potassio a 20%. Para isolamento dos agentes etiologicos, as amostras clinicas foram semeadas em duplicata em pontos equidistantes na superficie do meio agar Sabouraud adicionado de cloranfenicol (50 mg/L) contido em placas de Petri, as quais foram mantidas a temperatura ambiente (28o±1oC) e a 37oC. A identificacao dos fungos foi realizada utilizando-se as caracteristicas macroscopicas, microscopicas. O exame direto dos especimes clinicos da Lama glama nao revelou estruturas fungicas. Na cultura, em todos os pontos de inoculo foi detectado Paecilomyces farinosus. Pode-se observar com o teste de caracterizacao de patogenicidade o crescimento nas temperaturas ambiente 37o e 42oC que e um fator de patogenicidade. Nenhuma das culturas foi positiva para atividade fosfolipasica. Quanto a atividade proteasica o diâmetro da colonia foi de 6 cm e o halo da expressao enzimatica foi ZA = 0,7 mm, considerado forte (+++). O diagnostico laboratorial micologico nos casos relatados e de grande importância para o tratamento e cura, levando consequentemente a uma melhor qualidade de vida dos animais.",

    "abstract": "As possibilidades de uso de espermatozoides obtidos do epididimo vem sendo amplamente utilizadas devido a permanencia da capacidade espermatica fecundante e possibilidade de uso para felideos selvagens. Porem, no processo de criopreservacao, alguns estudos demonstram perdas na qualidade dos espermatozoides quando deixados sob refrigeracao antes da congelacao por tempos determinados. O presente trabalho teve por objetivo, avaliar a qualidade dos espermatozoides obtidos de epididimos de gatos domesticos, apos a criopreservacao utilizando um meio diluente a base de gema de ovo com glicerol (Botu-crio®), comparando as caracteristicas morfofuncionais, apos refrigeracao por 24 horas em container de transporte de semen (Botu-tainer®). Foram utilizados oito gatos domesticos submetidos a orquiectomia eletiva, com idades a partir de oito meses, sem determinacao racial e em bom estado nutricional (2,5 – 5,5kg ou 4kg em media). As caracteristicas espermaticas avaliadas foram: motilidade, vigor, concentracao, integridade de membrana e morfologia espermatica. Verificou-se que, apos avaliacoes estatisticas, o container de transporte de semen foi capaz de manter a viabilidade espermatica, mesmo apos as 24h. Observou-se tambem uma queda significativa de todos os parâmetros pos-congelacao, consequentes, provavelmente, ao estresse termico que ocorre no processamento. No entanto, a porcentagem de integridade de membrana pos-descongelacao demonstra boa empregabilidade do diluente Botu-crio®, com possivel viabilidade in vitro para realizacao de fertilizacoes, necessitando de maiores avaliacoes.",

Two production experiments were conducted on 32 hybrid fatteners (16 pigs per experiment, of 8 gilts and young hogs each, at a 1:1 ratio) fed complete diets in a 2-phase system. The animals were clinically healthy and had been treated for parasites prior to fattening. In the first experiment, diets were supplemented with the antibiotic flavomycin (group C1) and the probiotic ToyoCerin ( Bacillus toyoi strain) (group E1) at the amount of 0.1%, and in the second experiment with flavomycin (C2) and Bactocell ( Pedicoccus acidilactici, MA18/5M strain) (E2) at the amount of 0.01%. A histological analysis of small intestinal epithelial sections was performed using bax, bcl-x, bcl-2 polyclonal antibodies and Ki-67 and PCNA monoclonal antibodies. Sections of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum were prepared post mortem . Haematoxylin and eosin H-E, histochemical (PAS-Alcian Blue) and immunohistochemical staining procedures were applied. The results of histological, histochemical and immunohistochemical examinations of the small intestinal mucosa indicated that feed additives and probiotics had a varied effect on the morphological characteristics and the proliferation capacity of crypt epithelium. Enterocyte proliferation in crypt epithelium decreased after the administration of probiotics. The absence of significant differences between groups (C1-E1; C2-E2) may suggest that probiotics have no adverse effect on mucosal epithelial cells. Nevertheless, given the importance of this topic and the development of the use of feed additives, follow up research in this area is needed.",

The testis was removed from the abdominal cavity through a slightly enlarged incision for the instrument port. The testis positioned in the scrotum was in both cases removed using prescrotal castration with ligature of the spermatic funicle and a. et v. testicularis, ductus deferens as well as a. et v. ductus deferentis. Both patients were released into home care on the second day after the procedure without the need to administer further analgesics.

Contrast radiography technique excluded an envolvement of the oesophagus or stomach. Aspiration of 8 ml of acellular straw coloured fluid negative for presence of bacteria, fungi or parasites, reduced the swelling to a third of its original size. Surgical exploration revealed a pathologically changed central part of the liver with multiple different sized cysts. Histopathologically the diagnosis was defined as biliary cystadenoma. As the liver had a physiological appearance cranial and caudal to the central area, a partial hepatectomy was performed. The snake recovered well and started to feed spontaneously two days after surgery. During the check up two, four and seven months after hepatectomy, the snake was active and in a good condition. Hypoproteinaemia and altered activity of lactate dehydrogenase were present two months after surgery, azurophilia and hyperuricaemia were present in the blood sampled four months after hepatectomy. Except for azurophilia, the other values of the blood profile were within the expected range for a healthy snake seven months after surgery, indicating full recovery. This is the first detailed report of a successful central resection of a large pathologically changed part of the liver in snakes which was diagnosed as biliary cystadenoma.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the work was to describe an alternative method of treatment of prolapsed rectum in the sows. This approach was used to treat rectal prolapse in four affected sows. A 23.5 cm long Gerlach's needle was used for sewing a circular suture around the base of prolapsed rectum. The horizontal U-suture was performed with a synthetic absorbable surgical fibre. Two fibres 25–30 cm long were placed into the needle eye, the needle was inserted under finger control into the rectal lumen and the prolapsed tissue was penetrated from the inside to the outside. Both ends of the first fibre were grasped by haemostatic forceps and fixed for the last stitch and the inner end of the second fibre was placed into the needle eye with the third fibre. Rectal tissue was penetrated in the same manner at the distance of 2–3 cm from the place of the first penetration. The first U-stitch was made by tying both ends of the second fibre after the needle removal. The inner end of the third fibre was placed into the needle eye with the fourth fibre and the procedure was repeated around the whole prolapse until the first fibre was reached and used for the last stitch. The prolapsed tissue was excised by a blade at the distance of approximately 2 cm from the suture. There was no haemorrhage due to ligation of the tissue. After placing the simple continuous catgut suture around the rectum, a spontaneous retraction of the stump occurred, and the purse-string suture was not required. This method is applicable in practice in sows suffering from large, oedematous and hard prolapse when simple reposition or use of another surgical correction is impossible. In addition, the method may be used also in other large animal species.",

    "abstract": "The aim of our study was to develop a vitrification carrier for bovine oocyte cryopreservation. The carrier was to be cheap enough, elementary in its construction and meet contemporary requirements for a safe closed system. In a closed system, a cell is prevented from direct exposure to liquid nitrogen, thus minimizing the risk of cross-contamination. Furthermore, two questions regarding the proper vitrification technique were resolved: if it is necessary to partially denude the oocytes before the vitrification process or whether intact cumulus oocyte complexes should be frozen; and if it is more advantageous to preheat the vitrification solutions to female body temperature (39 °C) or to keep them at room temperature. Our results show that it is better to partially denude the oocytes prior to vitrification because cryopreserved intact cumulus oocyte complexes often proved dark, non-homogeneous or fragmented cytoplasm after warming, with many of them having visibly widened perivitelline spaces or fractured zonae pellucidae as a result of extensive damage during vitrification. Consequently, intact cumulus oocyte complexes showed significantly lower numbers of cleavage stage embryos on Day 3 compared to partially denuded oocytes (7.4% and 26%, respectively). On the other hand, the survival rate and following development of fertilized oocytes in preheated vitrification solution were equal to results reached at room temperature conditions. In conclusion, results achieved with the newly developed carrier were comparable to previously published studies and therefore they could be recommended for common use.",

    "abstract": "The outcomes of six different surgical techniques of caudal cervical spondylomyelopathy treatment in dogs with static and dynamic spinal cord compressions were assessed. Out of 425 dogs with cervical spine diseases, caudal cervical spondylomyelopathy was diagnosed in 69 dogs. Dynamic myelographic study was performed in 48 of them as a diagnostic method necessary for choosing the appropriate technique of surgical treatment. Twenty-five out of the 48 dogs underwent surgery. The best results of the surgical treatment of static compression were achieved with a ventral slot (89% of the nine surgical interventions) with partial improvement 48 h after surgery and marked improvement 8 weeks after surgery. For dynamic compressions, vertebral traction and stabilization with intervertebral washer plus vertebral body screws and polymethylmethacrylate bridge was found to be the most successful surgical treatment with significant improvement in 62% of the thirteen surgical interventions 8 weeks after surgery. In 5 dogs (20%), two intervertebral spaces with caudal cervical spondylomyelopathy were surgically treated. Recurrence was observed in 6 dogs (24%) after the mean period of 20 months (5 to 44 months) after surgery. Direct ventral slot decompression could be recommended for clinical cases of the caudal cervical spondylomyelopathy with static compression, and intervertebral washer plus vertebral body screws and polymethylmethacrylate bridge for dogs with dynamic compression, respectively. Our findings refer to the results of surgical treatment in a relatively large number of dogs with caudal cervical spondylomyelopathy and can help surgeons to choose an effective surgical method of treatment in dogs with wobbler syndrome based on dynamic myelographic study findings.",

Spirochetes were diagnosed microscopically in 23 out of 1139 samples of dogs’ excrements, primarily intended for a parasitological testing. The cultivation of positive samples provided 10 brachyspira isolates, which were, on the basis of their biochemical activity and the results of the species-specific PCR, identified as B. pilosicoli (9 isolates) and B. hyodysenteriae (1 isolate). These dogs came from households. All the 7 tested isolates B. pilosicoli were sensitive to metronidazole and doxycycline, uniformly resistant to erythromycin, partly sensitive to cefazoline, lincomicine and ampicilline except for one isolate of B. pilosicoli , which was resistant to ampicilline. The second part of study was focused on dogs with diarrhoea that came from animal shelters, where a high prevalence of 58% (10/17) of B. pilosicoli was found.",

    "abstract": "The study deals with the possibility of substituting time- and material-demanding mechanical testing of a bone defect fixation by mathematical modelling. Based on the mechanical model, a mathematical model of bone-implant construct stabilizing experimental segmental femoral bone defect (segmental ostectomy) in a miniature pig ex vivo model using 4.5 mm titanium LCP was created. It was subsequently computer-loaded by forces acting parallel to the long axis of the construct. By the effect of the acting forces the displacement vector sum of individual construct points occurred. The greatest displacement was noted in the end segments of the bone in close proximity to ostectomy and in the area of the empty central plate hole (without screw) at the level of the segmental bone defect. By studying the equivalent von Mises stress σ EQV on LCP as part of the tested construct we found that the greatest changes of stress occur in the place of the empty central plate hole. The distribution of this strain was relatively symmetrical along both sides of the hole. The exceeding of the yield stress value and irreversible plastic deformations in this segment of LCP occurred at the acting of the force of 360 N. These findings are in line with the character of damage of the same construct loaded during its mechanic testing. We succeeded in creating a mathematical model of the bone-implant construct which may be further used for computer modelling of real loading of similar constructs chosen for fixation of bone defects in both experimental and clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Biomechanics of fracture fixation and testing of mechanical properties of bone/implant construct from the viewpoint of checking the strength and resistance ability to acting forces are of current interest. Computer modelling known as mathematical modelling is regarded as an alternative to mechanical testing of properties on a testing machine. As a result, we get a 3D model of a real object (i.e., implant for fracture fixation in our case), which can be exposed to deformation processes in the environment of the mathematical software in order to characterize forces acting on the implant and subsequently analyze the forces causing the implant failure (broken plate). The goal of this study was to employ mathematical-statistical modelling for determination of forces that caused failure (broken implant) of a five-hole titanium 4.5 mm Locking Compression Plate. This plate has been used for flexible bridging osteosynthesis of segmental femoral diaphyseal defect in a miniature pig to investigate bone healing after transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells in combination with biocompatible scaffolds. Mathematical modelling has been performed with COMSOL Multiphysics software. Numerical study that describes deformation processes taking place in implant failure demonstrates the possibilities of deformation of five-hole titanium 4.5 mm LCP in the case of exceeding the elastic limits of a material. Knowledge of the forces acting on implants used for fracture fixation acquired from mathematical modelling might be used in clinical practice in order to prevent undesirable implant failure.",

In addition to their prevalence in humans, MRSA strains have also been detected in animals, both pets and food-producing animals, especially in pigs. At the same time, transmission of MRSA strains from animals to humans has been documented. This study brings results from the first nationwide survey on the prevalence of MRSA in herds of breeding pigs, carried out throughout the Czech Republic in accordance with the Commission Decision 2008/55/EC, including brief characteristics of isolates. In 2008, a total of 283 pooled samples (dust swabs from partitions between pens) from the holdings of breeding pigs were analyzed. In five cases, MRSA isolates were detected, with a prevalence of 1.8%. All the isolated strains belonged to a single sequence type ST398. It may be said that at present, the prevalence of MRSA on pig farms does not pose a significant general epidemiological risk for the human population.",

The experimental group (n = 15) received enrofloxacin parenterally (subcutaneously) at a dose of 5 mg/kg twice daily and amoxicillin-clavulanate intravenously at a dose of 22 mg/kg three times daily. The control group (n = 15) received only amoxicillin-clavulanate. Electrocardiography was carried out for 5 min once daily for 6 days. The QT interval was corrected by four different formulae. No differences were found between the two groups or within each group for the duration of the study. On the last day of the study the average QT interval for the control and experimental groups was 213.2 ms and 202.9 ms, respectively. Enrofloxacin did not cause prolongation of the QT or corrected QT intervals. We can conclude that the parenteral administration of enrofloxacin in non-cardiac dogs does not adversely affect the electrocardiographic indicators (no prolongation of the QT or corrected QT interval) and does not induce ventricular arrhythmias. Parenteral use of enrofloxacin is thus safe and effective in non-cardiac dogs.",

    "abstract": "The septal organ /SO/ (Masera's organ /MO/) is a chemoreceptor presently considered one of three types of olfactory organs (along with the principal olfactory region and vomeronasal organ). Notwithstanding the septal organ having been first described by Rodolfo Masera in 1943, little is known of the properties of sensory neurons or of its functional significance in chemoreception. Until now the septal organ has been described only in laboratory rodents and some marsupials. This work refers to its existence in the domestic cat ( Felis silvestris f. catus ). The septal organ can be identified at the end of embryonic period - 27 or 28 days of ontogenesis in cats (the 6th developmental stage of Štěrba) - coincident with formation of the principal olfactory region in nasal cavity. At 45 days of ontogenesis (the 9th developmental stage of Štěrba), this septal olfactory organ is of circular or oval shape, 120 μm in diameter, in ventral part of septum nasi, lying caudally to the opening of ductus incisivus. The structure of the epithelium of septal olfactory organ is clearly distinct from the respiratory epithelium of the nasal cavity. It varies in thickness, cellular composition, as well as free surface appearance, and even lack the typical structure of sensory epithelium, in this developmental period. Nerve bundles and glandular acini are lacking in the lamina propria mucosae of the septal organ and in the adjacent tissues. Glands appear as the single non-luminized cords of epithelia extending from the surface. The adjacent respiratory epithelium contains numerous goblet cells.",

The broiler farm was disinfected with a preparation based on peracetic acid while a preparation based on quarternary ammonium salt was used in the processing plant. We evaluated swabs taken from surfaces, which come into contact with broilers and broiler meat. Results of the swabs taken by standard microbiological swabbing method were evaluated with results of the swabs taken by the ATP-bioluminescence method. The microbiological examination included total counts of microorganisms, coliform count and moulds. When using the standard plate counts method on the broiler farm we found that the plate counts in 0% of swabs were &lt; 1, in 12% of swabs ranged between 1 - 100 CFU while in 88% of swabs reached &gt; 100 CFU. In the processing plant, out of 22% of swabs &lt; 1 CFU were recovered, in 36% of swabs plate counts ranged between 1 - 100 CFU and in 42% of swabs plate counts reached &gt; 100. The bioluminescence method was applied only in the processing plant where &lt; 100, 100 - 300 and &gt; 300 RLU were measured in 80, 10 and 10% of swabs, resp. Our observations and results allowed us to conclude that the disinfectants tested appeared suitable for the respective premises and the ATP bioluminescence method could be use as a as a suitable complement for detection of cleanliness of individual surfaces.",

Additionally, various terms of GnRH administration after PGF 2α were tested. Seventy five non-pregnant cows bearing corpus luteum were divided into groups according to the phase of follicular development on D 0 (day of PGF 2α administration)-growth (GR, follicles 3.0-7.9 mm in diameter), early dominance (ED, dominant follicle 8.0-14.9 mm) and late dominance (LD, dominant follicle 15.0-23.0 mm). In addition, the cows were divided into groups according to the terms of GnRH administration (24, 48 or 72 h after PGF 2α ). In this way, groups GR 48 (n = 5), GR 72 (n = 6), ED 24 (n = 10), ED 48 (n = 12), ED 72 (n = 12), LD 24 (n = 10), LD 48 (n = 10) and LD 72 (n = 10) were established. Growth of ovulatory follicle, term of ovulation, insemination and conception rates as well as relation of the size of preovulatory follicle (day of ovulation) to the size of following corpus luteum (day 14) were evaluated. The highest level of synchronization of ovulation (100% on D 3) as well as conception rate (50%) was achieved in group ED 48. This protocol gives an opportunity of timing artificial insemination to 18-24 hours after GnRH administration, as ovulation occurs with a high probability within 24 - 48 hours after GnRH administration.",

    "abstract": "Dental diseases are a persistent problem, not only in humans, but very often in companion animals as well. Aetiological agents of these diseases are the dental plaque bacteria. In the present study, we focused on identifying cultivable bacteria living in the dental plaque of dogs, specifically dogs suffering from the early stages of periodontal disease. Canine oral bacteria pose a risk to humans that get bitten by the dog, but they also have a zoonotic potential. Dental plaque samples were taken from five dogs of small breeds. Samples were cultured under aerobic and anaerobic conditions on several types of microbiological agars. All obtained and selected bacterial colonies were identified by PCR with universal primers for the 16S rRNA gene and the sequences of the 16S rRNA gene were compared with the sequences available in the GenBank database using BLASTn analysis. A total of 75 bacteria belonging to five phyla, predominantly to Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, were identified. The most frequent species was Pasteurella canis which was detected in all samples. In addition, representatives of the genera Actinomyces , Bacillus , Bacteroides , Corynebacterium , Frederiksenia , Fusobacterium , Haemophilus , Lactobacillus , Leucobacter , Neisseria , Ottowia , Porphyromonas , Pseudomonas , Staphylococcus , Stenotrophomonas and Streptococcus were detected in the samples. In the present study, a broad spectrum of bacteria in dental plaque samples, including canine periodontal pathogens such as Porphyromonas gulae or Porphyromonas macacae were identified. In addition, highly pathogenic bacteria, specifically Actinomyces hordeovulneris , Bacillus circulans , and Bacteroides pyogenes , which pose a serious risk to human health, were detected in samples.",

In a temperate forest of the community of San Pedro Yolox, Ixtlán in the Sierra Madre de Oaxaca, Mexico, we collected bats of various species, including 13 specimens of Myotis velifer that showed lesions in the plagio- and uro-patagium. Clinical exploration, histopathological studies and molecular analysis were carried out to determine the causal agent of the lesions present in these individuals. It was determined that the cause was the pathogenic fungus Debaryomyces spp. The present study represents the first report of fungal infection in bats in southern Mexico.",

A total of 30 rats were separated into 5 groups as control (C), diabetes (D), diabetes + anakinra (DA), diabetes + etanercept (DE), and diabetes + anakinra + etanercept (DAE). Anakinra (10 mg/kg/day, s.c.) and etanercept (10 mg/kg, twice weekly, s.c.) were administered to the DA and DE groups, respectively, and the DAE group received both anakinra and etanercept for 21 days. Histopathologically, pathological changes related to diabetes in internal organs occurred in the diabetes group, and there was a significant decrease (improvement) in these changes in the treatment groups ( P &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference ( P &gt; 0.05) between the treatment groups, but some changes in the liver and kidneys were higher in the combined group which should be taken into account for longer use. Although there was no significant difference, etanercept was more effective on pancreatic lesion scores and anakinra was more effective on testicular changes. As a result, the single or combined use of IL-1 and TNF-α antagonists anakinra and etanercept were effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes in rats without any toxic-pathological effect.",

Apical leakage technique was used to evaluate ability of each method to provide adequate apical obturation. The endodontic technique utilizing warm vertical condensation with chemically softened guttapercha in the apical region provided the best radiographic appearance without apical dye leakage. The same vertical obturation technique without the use of chemically softened gutta-percha in the apical region showed 33% dye leakage incidence. Lateral obturation techniques provided the least qualitative radiographic appearance to the endodontic fill and dye leakage incidence. Results of evaluation of quality of apical obturation of root canals based on X-ray examination and apical dye leakage resulted in the following conclusions: lateral obturation techniques used in this study have their limitations resulting from typical root canal anatomy; vertical obturation techniques showed better hermetic apical sealing, mainly in the case of vertical condensation of the chemically softened gutta-percha in the apical part of the root canal.",

    "abstract": "Despite high behavioural similarity, some differences in the central neural control of the cough and sneeze reflexes have been suggested. The main aim of our study was to analyze and compare characteristics of electromyographic (EMG) activities of the respiratory muscles during these two behaviours. Data were taken from eight adult rabbits under pentobarbital anaesthesia. We compared diaphragm EMG activities in tracheobronchial cough, sneeze, and quiet breathing during inspiration. Electromyograms were read from the abdominal muscles during the expiratory phases of coughing and sneezing. Due to the non-stationary character of electromyographic signals, we used wavelet analysis to determine the time-frequency distribution of energy during the behaviours. Inspiratory durations of all above mentioned behaviours were similar. The maximum inspiratory power occurred later in sneeze than during quiet inspiration ( P &lt; 0.05). The total inspiratory power during sneeze was higher compared to that in cough ( P &lt; 0.05) and quiet inspiration ( P &lt; 0.01). Lower frequencies contributed to this increase significantly more in sneeze compared to cough (less than 287.5 Hz, P &lt; 0.05; 287.5 Hz up to 575 Hz, P &lt; 0.01). We found similar energy distribution for coughing and quiet inspiration. Its maximum occurred at lower frequency in quiet inspiration compared to sneezing ( P &lt; 0.01). The abdominal burst during cough was longer than that in sneezing ( P &lt; 0.001). Our results support the concept that both cough and eupnoeic inspiration are generated by similar neuronal structures. A non-specific mechanism producing expiratory activity during tracheobronchial cough and sneeze is suggested.",

This review discusses the role of HSC subpopulations in recovery of haematopoiesis after irradiation, and molecular mechanisms of reaction of HSC to damage induced by genotoxic stress, mainly to double strand breaks (DSB) of DNA. Various proteins are accumulated on the site of break, e.g. 53BP1 and γH2AX. Repair of the damage and related signalling is executed by many proteins, such as ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK kinases, MRN complex and proteins of homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining. Repetitive irradiation by low doses of ionizing radiation causes in HSC accumulation of proteins into so-called “ionizing radiation inducing foci” (detectable by γH2AX) and decreases repair capacity of HCS. Furthermore, two possible molecular mechanisms of HSC reaction to radiationinduced DNA damage are discussed – apoptosis and senescence. While majority of differentiated haematopoietic cells, leukaemic cells, and haematopoietic progenitors die after irradiation by apoptosis, in HSC also senescence was detected. It also seems that decrease in proliferative capacity of HSC related to old age is caused by accumulation of DNA damage induced by oxygen radicals in the pool of quiescent stem cells.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the study was to observe the effect of experimental hypodynamy simulating weightlessness in space on the structure, ultrastructure and alkaline phosphatase activity of kidney in Japanese quail ( Coturnix coturnix japonica ). Two days after hatching, the quails were suspended in special shirts below the cage ceiling so their feet did not touch the floor. They could consume food and water ad libitum . Experimental animals were sacrificed after 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49 and 56 days of hypodynamy. Birds of the same age, hatched at the same time, and fed the same diet were used as a control. Samples of kidney were processed for light (LM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and alkaline phosphatase (AP) analysis. Short-term (14–28 days) hypodynamy caused no marked damage to the structure and ultrastructure of kidneys. However, after long-term (35–59 days) hypodynamy, morphological changes were observed in some cells of the proximal and distal tubules. The dying cells in proximal tubules, observed in semi-thin sections by LM, were dark and contained a nucleus of irregular shape. Observation by TEM showed that their nucleus was dark and shrivelled and the electron-dense cytoplasm contained long, dense, rod-shaped mitochondria with thin mitochondrial cristae. Microvilli were present on the apical surface of cells and formed a brush border. Sporadic dying cells were also observed in distal tubules. Large, light vacuoles were found in the cytoplasm of cells of collecting tubules, however, the structure of renal corpuscles and medullary loops remained undisturbed. Microscopical analysis by means of a direct TUNEL reaction on days 35 to 59 of hypodynamy showed a moderate occurrence of cellular apoptosis in the proximal and distal tubules of experimental Japanese quail. The activity of AP in the brush border of the proximal tubules on days 14–29 of hypodynamy was normal in experimental animals and showed no significant differences in comparison with the control. Between days 35 and 59 of hypodynamy a moderate decrease in the content of AP in experimental animals in comparison with the control ( P &lt; 0.01) was observed. Our results indicated that long-term hypodynamy caused apoptosis of some cells in the proximal and distal tubules and therefore had a negative effect on the kidney structure. The occurrence of apoptosis was only sporadic. We presume no negative effect on the kidney function and the Japanese quails are capable of further development under the conditions of prolonged simulated weightlessness.",

The closure of aorta in duration of 12 min caused a neurological deficit in 81% of rats, 14 min of ischemia paralysed 90% of animals. Preconditioning with 3-min ischemia following 30 min recirculation improved the neurological score in the group with 12 min of ischemia after 48 h, in which only 27% of rats were paralysed. The same preconditioning was performed in the group of animals with 14 min of ischemia, and as a consequence, 33% of rats were paralysed in that group. Protection of the spinal cord during ischemia can be achieved by preconditioning. Thus the method of preconditioning appears to be a prospective technique for the improvement of the devastating neurological deficit after surgery on the aorta and has provided optimism that additional therapies will be possible in the future.",

We evaluated the valve function by epicardial echo before and after implantation, respectively. The findings were confirmed by haemodynamic measurements as well. It was proved that mitral allografts, harvested, processed, and stored according to the Cardiovascular Tissue Bank Protocol remained mechanically strong enough for implantation into the tricuspid position. It was demonstrated that the mitral allograft transplantation into the tricuspid position is feasible. The immediate postoperative haemodynamic performance was excellent in all animals.

Freezing point measurements of raw and heat-treated milk were carried out in compliance with the Standard CTS 57 0538 by a thermistor cryoscope. The FP of raw cow milk increased with heat treatment from the initial values of -0.5252 ± 0.0114 °C (O) by 0.0023 °C (A), 0.0034 °C (B) and 0.0051°C (C). Changes in FP values of goat milk were detected, from its initial value of –0.5530 ± 0.0086 °C there was an increase in the FP depending on the mode of heat treatment due to pasteurization by an average of 0.0028 °C (A), 0.0036 °C (B) and 0.0054 °C (C). The dynamics of the changes were similar both in goat and cow milk. Freezing point values in cow and goat milk differed ( P ⪬ 0.01) when compared to the freezing point of untreated milk after the individual interventions as well as when compared between each other. An increase in the heat treatment temperature of cow and goat milk causes an increase in the freezing point (a shift towards zero).

Six adult Egyptian spiny mice ( Acomys cahirinus , Desmarest) were studied for the presence and location of autonomic fibres and cells in the pancreas. The macromorphological investigations were performed using the thiocholine method adapted for this type of specimens. For processing tissues two histochemical techniques were used: thiocholine method on activity of AChE and the glyoxylic acid method for adrenergic structures. Cholinergic fibres and small autonomic ganglia were found among the secretory sections and along the pancreatic duct and both pancreaticoduodenal arteries, and its branches, reaching the Langerhans islets and forming around them a kind of net. From 24 to 40 AChE-positive ganglions in the whole exocrine part were observed. The highest density of cholinergic fibres was observed in the head of pancreas. Numerous adrenergic fibres that accompanied blood vessels as well as interlobular and intralobular ducts were found inside the exocrine parts of the pancreas. Neither adrenergic cells or adrenergic fibres were observed inside the pancreatic islets. Our results can be used in comparative anatomy studies of pancreas in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury of the testis results in germ cell specific apoptosis, a process in which neutrophil recruitment to the testes plays a critical role. Adhesion molecules, in particular E- and P-selectins, play a critical role in this recruitment. The present study sought to characterize the inhibitory effect of function-blocking monoclonal anti-mouse E- and P-selectin antibodies on the migration of neutrophils into the IR-induced testis of the mouse. Mice were subjected to a 2 hr period of testicular torsion (ischemia) followed by detorsion (reperfusion). Ten minutes after the onset of reperfusion mice received either a mixture of 200 μg function-blocking monoclonal E-selectin and P-selectin antibody (FBMAb group; 100 μg; each) intravenously or 200 μg of isotype-matched control-antibody (IMCAb group). Separate groups of mice underwent shamoperation (SO group) or received 500 ng of TNFα (IF group) to induce inflammation. Mice were sacrificed 24 h after reperfusion and testicular interstitial cells were isolated and analyzed for the presence of neutrophils by means of flow cytometry. The mixture of function-blocking monoclonal E- and P-selectin antibody (FBMAb) decreased neutrophil recruitment to the IR-induced testis significantly (FBMAb group as compared to the IMCAb group 20.2 ± 2.8 vs. 51.9 ± 4.0 % Gr-1+CD11b+ of total leukocytes; p = 0.0002). Therefore, blocking both E- and P-selectin may be therapeutically beneficial to protect postischemic testis.",

Based on the history, clinical signs, palpation, trans-scrotal ultrasonography and semen collection, a left scrotal hernia was diagnosed. Ultrasonographic examination showed a presumably omental fat scrotal hernia with an atrophic left testis and varicocele, and the presence of two sperm cysts could be observed in the right epididymal tail. The testis appeared as a homogeneous and moderately echogenic structure and it was possible to distinguish atrophy of the left testis that was covered by a hyperechoic area, presumably omental fat, within the hernial sac. In addition, on ultrasound examination non-echogenic tortuous areas were present and diagnosed as varicocele. Post mortem examination confirmed gross lesions identified ultrasonographically. The libido of the ram was normal but the semen showed total azoospermia. Ultrasound imaging can be used as a diagnostic technique to confirm the diagnosis of scrotal hernia, varicocele, sperm cyst and testis mineralization.",

    "abstract": "Pathological changes of the equine navicular bone are found in a variety of forms in numerous old and also relatively young horses. Therefore, investigations on this small bone are of major practical significance. The current article presents a view of the alterations observed on the distal aspect of the bone and analyzes their origin and importance. As a result of pressure subjected by the deep digital flexor tendon and adaptive remodelling of the bone tissue, distal border of the navicular bone extends and becomes sharpened. Osseous distal border fragments may be a consequence of this phenomenon. However, the origin of fragments is also associated with the development of entheseophytes on the margins, which can result from stress induced by the distal impar sesamoid ligament. The authors are not unanimous about the clinical importance of fragments, but it seems that the most dangerous are large-sized ones, especially when occurring together with other lesions. An important issue is also the alterations of the nutrient foramina located on the distal border, due to the main role of this surface in blood supply. Changes in the size and shape of pathological synovial invaginations can be a sign of circulatory disturbances and abnormal turnover of the bone tissue. Some researchers link synovial invaginations to cases of lameness, but their importance is still enigmatic. Majority of studies focus on warmblood horses, and a lower interest in coldblood horses can be seen. Nonetheless, certain data are a strong argument that the breed and morphotype can affect the frequency of adverse changes.",

    "abstract": "Antioxidant effect of dietary soapwort extract supplementation was studied in growing Japanese quails suffering from chronic intermittent cold stress. For this purpose, a total of ninety 15-d-old quails were divided into three groups with three replicates. Chronic intermittent cold stress was applied every night between 22.00 to 06.00 h; starting at 14 °C for the first week, and gradually weekly lowered to 8 °C. Three groups were fed with corn-soy based standard diets supplemented with 0, 50, and 100 ppm soapwort extract for four weeks. At the end of the study, three males and three females were slaughtered to determine total antioxidant and oxidant status of serum, malondialdehyde, glutathione, glutathione peroxidase activity, superoxide dismutase of liver and heart tissues. Although the dietary soapwort extract had no effect on serum total antioxidant capacity, it significantly lowered the total oxidant status of serum in cold stressed quails. Glutathione and superoxide dismutase enzyme activity of liver and heart tissues were similar among groups. While the dietary soapwort extract had no effect on glutathione peroxidase activity of the heart tissue, it significantly increased glutathione peroxidase activity in the liver tissue. In relation to the control group, malondialdehyde concentrations in the liver and heart tissues were significantly lower in soapwort extract groups. These data suggest that dietary soapwort extract could alleviate the detrimental effects of oxidative stress in growing Japanese quails exposed to cold stress.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to determine the effect of different physical forms of starter feed on rumen fermentation indicators of calves after weaning and their weight gain. The experiment was performed with Czech Fleckvieh calves after weaning. The calves were fed ad libitum completely pelleted starter feed or texturized starter feed with chopped straw. The rumen fluid samples were collected after a month of feeding the starter feeds. The calves were weighed monthly. The pH, total acidity, total volatile fatty acids, acetate, propionate, butyrate, lactic acid, ammonia and the number of rumen ciliate protozoa were determined in the rumen fluid samples. The calves receiving the starter feed with straw showed significantly higher rumen pH (6.24 ± 0.51 vs. 5.58 ± 0.30), total volatile fatty acids (98.02 ± 20.46 vs. 61.40 ± 26.51 mmol/l), molar proportion of acetate (61.20 ± 4.87 vs. 50.53 ± 4.66%), and the acetate:propionate ratio (2.38 ± 0.53 vs. 1.34 ± 0.18) and lower molar proportion of propionate (26.55 ± 4.48 vs. 37.92 ± 3.58%) compared with the calves receiving pelleted starter feed. Average daily gain of the calves did not differ significantly. The feeding of starter feed with chopped straw compared with the pelleted starter feed led to better development of the rumen fermentation evaluated by rumen pH, by total volatile fatty acids production, and by the proportion and ratio of acetic and propionic acids. The feeding of starter feed with chopped straw reduced the occurrence of subacute ruminal acidosis in the weaned calves.",

The assays were tested on a panel of 25 archived viral haemorrhagic septicaemia isolates and 8 archived infectious haematopoietic necrosis isolates obtained from monitoring and/or outbreaks of the diseases among farmed salmonids in the Czech Republic. The ability to detect the presence of the virus in the tissues of fish was tested on additional 32 field samples collected from the rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ), brown trout ( Salmo trutta ) and brook trout ( Salvelinus fontinalis ). The real-time assay showed the highest analytic sensitivity by detecting the presence of viral nucleic acid in samples with 10 -7 dilution, whereas the sensitivity of the conventional polymerase chain reaction peaked at 10 -5 . Diagnostic specificity of both molecular assays was confirmed by absence of cross-reactivity with the infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus isolates. This, along with consistent results in the detection of the virus in the fish tissues, confirms that the one-step real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction is currently an optimal stand-alone diagnostic method for the detection of the viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus.",

    "abstract": "Bendiocarb belongs to the group of carbamate insecticides that inhibit acetylcholinesterase. In agriculture, it is used to control a variety of insects, therefore it is important to examine every potential aspect of its toxicology. The aim of this study was to observe the effect of bendiocarb on the ultrastructure of the skeletal muscle in rabbits. Rabbits in all experimental groups received capsules of bendiocarb (96% Bendiocarb, Bayer, Germany) per os daily at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight. Samples of skeletal muscles were collected on days 10 and 20. On day 10 of the experiment, muscle fibres were not affected consistently. The observed changes were moderate and focal. Electron microscopy revealed dilatation of sarcoplasmic reticulum, and myofilament disorganization. On day 20 of the experiment, the ultrastructural changes in muscle fibres were more intense and more frequent. The most important alteration was the disruption of the sarcomeres due to the lysis of both thick and thin myofilaments. However, in the unchanged regions of muscle fibres a prominent mitochondrial swelling was observed. Many mitochondria lacked cristae and thus appeared as large membrane-bound cytoplasmic vesicles. The results presented in this study indicate that bendiocarb affects the ultrastructure of skeletal muscles. The intensity of damage (dissolution of myofilaments and disruption of sarcomeres) was related to the duration of administration of bendiocarb.",

    "abstract": "Ergasilosis is a common parasitic disease of fish caused by species of the family Ergasilidae. During the fish growing season, parasitic abundance (including developmental stages) changes in relation to zooplankton development. In this study, we evaluated the seasonal dynamics of ergasilosis in relation to zooplankton development at two reservoirs (Hubenov, Koryčany) in the Morava River Basin (Czech Republic). Samples of fish and zooplankton were obtained at monthly intervals between April and October 2014. In total, 189 fish of 11 species were caught using electrofishing and seine nets. Overall, epidemiological characteristics were higher in the Hubenov reservoir, which also hosted higher numbers of pelagic Copepods. Hubenov also supported a higher number of predatory fish species, which presumably helped to reduce the number of zooplanktonophagic cyprinids. Our results suggest that each reservoir represents a unique ecosystem with its own pattern of ergasilosis seasonal development. Differences between reservoirs are closely related to zooplankton development, which is in turn affected by the fish stock in each reservoir. As the nauplius and copepod stages of arthropods form part of the zooplankton assemblage, they will be found at highest numbers in reservoirs where predatory fish suppress zooplanktonophagic fish species. We suggest to analyse zooplankton with the determination of the genus Ergasilus .",

    "abstract": "This study was aimed to study the potentially beneficial effects of agmatine on oxidative/nitrosative stress development in the brain of Wistar rats during subacute chlorpromazine treatment. The animals were divided into control (0.9% saline), chlorpromazine (38.7 mg/kg b.w.), chlorpromazine+agmatine (agmatine 75 mg/kg b.w. immediately after chlorpromazine, 38.7 mg/kg b.w. i.p.) and agmatine (75 mg/kg b.w.) groups. All the tested substances were administered intraperitoneally for 15 consecutive days and the rats were sacrificed by decapitation on day 15. Subacute administration of chlorpromazine resulted in increased lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide concentration and superoxide anion production, while completely damaging the antioxidant defence system in the cerebral cortex, striatum, and hippocampus. However, the combined treatment with chlorpromazine and agmatine significantly attenuated the oxidative/nitrosative stress indices and restored the antioxidant capacity to the control values in all of the examined brain regions. Western blot analysis supported biochemical findings in all groups, but the most notable changes were found in the hippocampus. Our results suggest potentially beneficial effects of agmatine, which may be useful in the modified antioxidant approach in chlorpromazine-therapy.",

Intramedullary spinal cord tumours in dogs are described infrequently and present a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. A nine-year-old Beagle dog was referred because of tetraparesis of a 20-day duration. The neurological signs were suggestive of a selective lesion involving the cervical spinal cord. Sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical vertebral column revealed a ventral, well-circumscribed mass within the vertebral canal at the level of cervical segment 6 (C6). A primary neoplasia was considered as probable differential diagnosis. The mass was removed by cervical laminectomy, durotomy and gentle dissections. On the basis of histological and immunohistochemical findings, a diagnosis of transitional meningioma (grade I) was made. Treatment of the meningioma with surgery resulted in a complete recovery, the dog was able to walk 21 days after surgery and had normal walk two months after presentation. Clinicopathologic and treatment data of cranial intraspinal meningiomas have been reported sporadically, but a segment 6 location was not thoroughly described before.",

    "abstract": "A Furioso-North Star mare, aged 8 years, was examined for colic signs. The mare had a history of dystocia and post partum vaginal lacerations, acute endometritis and laminitis approximately one year before the admission for colic. Signs of persistent abdominal pain, moderate distended abdomen, non-passage of manure, fever, tachycardia, tachypnoea, congested mucus membranes, and “toxic line” were recorded. No intestinal borborygmi were present in the four quarters of the abdomen. On rectal examination, the colon, the ventral band of the caecum, the right ovary and the uterine horn were palpated on the right side of the abdomen. The spleen, the nephrosplenic ligament, the left ovary and a firm, distended and painful small intestine (SI) loop were palpated on the left side. The left uterine horn and the adjacent broad ligament were not detectable. Percutaneous abdominal ultrasound evaluation revealed a large amount of fluid in the abdominal cavity, SI distention and absence of peristalsis. Abdominocentesis yielded approximately 20 ml of red-tinged peritoneal fluid with increased mean protein concentration (5.2 mg/dl), white blood cell count (12,550 cells/μl), and lactate (14 mmol/dl). A presumptive diagnosis of SI strangulation was made. Surgical resection of the affected intestinal loops was recommended. Due to poor prognosis and financial limitations, the mare was euthanized. Post mortem macroscopic diagnosis was a herniation of 3 metres of the mid-jejunum through the left mesometrium, resulting in a complete and complicated strangulation. To prevent this type of SI strangulation, we recommend transrectal palpation of the urogenital tract (including the broad ligament) after foaling. If a defect is identified, we recommend flank laparoscopy for correction.",

Experimental vaccine containing Microsporum callis culture showed good protective efticacy against experimental mycosis (ringworm) in challenge bioassays on dogs and calves. The efficacy of a commercial vaccine containing Trichophyton verrucoswn strain proved very good against infection with M. canis in calves but insufticient in dogs. Microsporum cllnis. Trichophyton \\·errllCOSlllll. vaccines. immunity Microsporum canis Bodin 1902, a zoophilic dermatophyte, has been reported to play the main role in dermal mycotic diseases of cats and dogs (B 0 h m 1981; Pin a r d et al. 1987; Moriello and DeBoer 1991; Sparkes et al. 1993). These carnivores are then the main source of infection for other animal species. The disease is also known to affect humans: according to S cot t and Horn (1987) microsporia account for 15% of all human dermatophytoses. The development of an efficacious vaccine against M. canis has therefore beentheobjectiveofanumberofresearchteams(Mosher etal.1977; Elad and Segal 1989; Smith etal. 1992). The present study was designed to test the protective efficacy of a living vaccine prepared from M. canis culture in challenge bioassays on dogs and calves. Concurrent tests were made with Trichoben A Y, a commercial vaccine, containing living avirulent Trichophyton verrllcosllm culture which has been used successfully for immunization of cattle against trichophytosis (S i e sen 0 p et al. 1994). The objective was to assess its protective efficacy against experimental infection with M. callis (cross immunity). Materials and Methods The experimental animals were six-month old crosses of small-breed dogs and one-month old calves of the Bohemian pied breed. The animals of the two species were divided into the following three groups: Group I animals were each vaccinated i.m. twice with prophylactic doses of Trichoben A V. a commercial vaccine containing living Trichophyton lerruCO.HIIII strain TV-M-31O. protective lyophilization medium and buffered saline (manufactured by Bioveta. Ltd .. Ivanovice na Hanel. Group 2 animals were each vaccinated i.m. twice with experimental living vaccine prepared from Microsporum canis strain 602. protective lyophilization medium and buffered saline. The interval between the vaccinations was 8 days in both groups. Group 3 animals received no vaccination and served as controls. Thirty-six days after revaccination the dogs and the calves of the three groups were each infected with challenge culture of Microsporulll callis strain B-710. The challenge was carried out by the rubbing 2 ml suspension of the culture into a lOx 10 ern area of the clipped and gently scarified skin of the right flank. The challenge dose was 2 million CFU per animal for dogs and 6 million CFU per animal for calves. The animals were examined at intervals of several days for 32 days after challenge. At the end of the experiments skin lesions and hair specimens were collected or abrasions were made at the challenge site and examined by culture and microscopically (R y b n i k a r 1992).",

Young animals with fast growth and excellent body conditions are more frequently affected. In this article, an outbreak of nutritional myopathy is reported in sheep raised in rural zone of Mossoro-RN. From February 2007 to July 2007, clinical and epidemiological evaluation of the animals was realized. The sheep were fed with high protein and carbohydrate in diet. Eight sheep, aged between two and four months, were affected. Three of them (animals 1, 2 and 3), showed weakness, muscle tremors, incoordination, reluctance to move, sternal recumbency and dyspnea, while the others (animals 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8) died without any previous clinical signs. Animals 1, 2 and 3 died spontaneously, and they were necropsied and submitted to anatomopathological examination. On histology, segmental muscular necrosis areas were observed in the cardiac and skeletal muscles examined. The treatment was made using selenium and vitamin E. There was no clinical remission that has confirmed nutritional myopathy diagnosis. A possible predisposing factor for the occurrence of this disease was the overfeeding using high protein and carbohydrate in diet of the young animals.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Selenium and vitamin E deficiency, sheep, muscular segmental necrosis.",

Prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) were determined in non-diluted and diluted blood plasma samples. Clotting times determined in diluted plasma samples were prolonged in cows with hepatic lipidosis and there was a difference in the PT value at both 50% and 25% plasma dilutions between both groups of animals ( P = 0.004 and P = 0.001). Significant differences between healthy animals and cows with hepatic lipidosis were observed in blood serum values for free fatty acids (FFA), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and triacyglycerols ( P = 0.001, P = 0.007 and P = 0.044), respectively. FFA and liver biopsy are better diagnostic indicators for hepatic lipidosis than coagulation tests. The optimised PT is prolonged in cows with hepatic lipidosis and can detect this alteration that cannot be appreciated using conventional PT test.",

The examination was performed on lateromedial, palmaroproximal-palmarodistal views and on dorsoproximal-palmarodistal, dorsolateral-palmaromedial, dorsomedial-palmarolateral views of a raised limb placed on a navicular block, and of weight-bearing limbs. During the examination, doses of scattered radiation were measured at the sites of radiographer, assistant holding a film cassette and assistant positioning the examined limb or the opposite one. The lowest radiation dose was received by the assistant holding the cassette behind the examined region; a total equivalent dose of 183.6 - 201.7 nSv was received by his hands and genitals, and 110.8 - 113.3 nSv by his eye lens and neck during the examination of the distal interphalangeal joint. The radiographer was exposed to higher radiation; an equivalent dose of 846.6 - 854.1 nSv was received by his hands and genitals, and 271.8 - 328.2 nSv by the eye lens and the neck. The highest scattered radiation dose was received by the assistant positioning the examined limbs; equivalent doses were 7751 - 9354 nSv (hands), 1117.3 - 1119.5 nSv (genitals), and 880.6 - 1096.2 nSv (eye lens and neck). The equivalent dose values measured, received by the radiographer and the assistants during the examination of the distal interphalangeal joint seem to be very low relative to radiation exposure limits. However, it must be taken into account that the personnel involved in radiography is also exposed to scattered radiation during other examinations where radiation doses are often much higher. These results indicate the necessity to use protective lead aprons, gloves and collars during radiography of the distal interphalangeal joint.",

Studies were performed with isolated, modifi ed Langendorff-perfused rat hearts and ischemia of heart was initiated by stopping the coronary flow for 30 min, followed by 60 min of reperfusion (14 ml min -1 ). Wistar rats were divided into three groups. The treated group received pomiferin (5 mg/kg/day in 0.5% Avicel); the placebo group received only 0.5% Avicel; the intact group was left without any applications. Biochemical indicators of oxidative damage, lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde, antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, total antioxidant activity in serum and myocardium has been evaluated. We also examined the effect of pomiferin on cardiac function (left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, left ventricular pressure, peak positive +dP/dt (rate of pressure development) after ischemia and reperfusion. Our results demonstrate that pomiferin attenuates the myocardial dysfunction provoked by ischemiareperfusion. This was confirmed by the increase in both the antioxidant enzyme values and the total antioxidant activity. The cardio-protection provided by pomiferin treatment results from the suppression of oxidative stress and correlates with the improved ventricular function.",

    "abstract": "The factors affecting the course of lactation and intensity of milk secretion include the condition and body weight, as well as chewing time. A little researched factor is also the cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) which has been suggested to have an anorexigenic function. This study sought to examine the dependent indicators of condition and chewing time on daily milk yield assessment in the context of the concentration of CART, glucose and ß-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) in blood. Higher CART levels contributed to shorter chewing time (min/day), lower body condition and lower body weight. Blood glucose concentration showed a stronger correlation with body weight and condition than with blood BHB concentration. An important practical aspect of the results is the relationship shown between CART and chewing time and the potential relation between daily milk production and chewing time. Importantly, the animals with lower daily milk production had relatively the highest concentration CART. This may suggest that this neuropeptide is indirectly involved in milk production, especially by shortening the chewing time. The obtained results help to better explain the mechanisms involved in milk secretion and the process of rumination and digestion. More research is required, but they also show important functions of other examined neuropeptides.",

    "abstract": "A retrospective analysis of dog adoption records was performed with the aim to determine the differences in preferences of male and female adopters in the Czech Republic. From January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2016, 955 dogs were adopted out of a selected shelter. Significantly ( P = 0.03) more dogs were adopted by women than by men (52.6% vs 47.4%, respectively). No preference ( P = 0.06) for adopting a dog of the same or opposite sex as the adopter’s was found. Women adopted more ( P = 0.02) small dogs and men more ( P = 0.004) large dogs, while the adoption rate of medium dogs did not differ ( P = 0.16) between men and women. Significantly more ( P = 0.05) older dogs were adopted by women than by men. With the exception of brown dogs (adopted more often by women) and black dogs with dark markings (adopted more often by men), dogs with different coat colors were adopted equally by men and women. No difference was found between the ratio of crossbred and purebred dogs adopted by men and women. This study fills gaps in scientific knowledge on adopters’ preferences. Women are more willing to adopt dogs including those that may require special care (older dogs). However, women are less likely to adopt large dogs. The lower number of male adopters may be the reason why large dogs are often reported to be difficult to rehome. To remedy this, shelter operators should explore ways how to address men if they have large dogs available for adoption.",

Thirty two adult healthy New Zealand rabbits were randomly allocated to 4 different groups of 8 animals. A 2 × 2 cm urinary bladder defect was repaired by the same size of fascia lata in experimental groups (Group 1, 2, 3). Rabbits in Group 1, 2 and 3 were euthanized at the end of the 4 th , 8 th and 12 th week after surgeries, respectively. No surgical procedure was carried out for the urinary bladder of the rabbits in the control group, but their urinary bladders were used for biomechanical tests and the values compared with those of Group 1, 2 and 3. Histopathological examination of the grafted area was performed. The grafted area was consistent with that of the tissue of urinary bladder. No significant difference was found between the urinary bladder and the grafted area. No differences in biomechanical tests were recorded between grafted and ungrafted urinary bladders. Histopathologically, fascia lata turned into a normal urinary bladder tissue. Therefore, a fascia lata autograft can be succesfully used in urinary bladder defects. Fascia lata grafts can be used successfully in pathological conditions of the urinary bladder that require a new tissue.",

    "abstract": "The most common methods that can be used for species identification of tuna include methods based on detection of species-specific DNA via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. The problem with DNA detection in processed products is the possibility of DNA fragmentation during the technological process. The quantity and quality of extracted DNA is a crucial step for species identification based on the DNA analysis. In this study, two DNA extraction methods (DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit and DNeasy mericon Food Kit) for tuna DNA isolation were compared. Eight food products of canned tuna (three of them were declared as Thunnus albacares and five products were declared as Katsuwonus pelamis ) with a different addition of various ingredients were tested. Furthermore, three different times of proteolysis (30 min, 60 min, overnight) for each sample and each extraction kit were evaluated. The DNA concentration was determined by a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit fluorescence method and quantified using a Qubit fluorometer. The DNA purity was evaluated using the A260/A280 ratio of absorbances measured on a spectrophotometer. The main indicator of DNA quality and quantity was its amplifiability in the subsequent real-time PCR for Thunnus species, Thunnus albacares and Katsuwonus pelamis . Based on the results, both kits can be used for tuna species determination in highly heat-treated products with different composition, nevertheless, the DNeasy mericon Food Kit provided better statistical values in some parameters. The effect of different times of proteolysis was significant in most of the samples with regard to the crossing point values determined by real-time PCR.",

    "abstract": "This study was aimed at the evaluation of the electrophoretic pattern of serum proteins in dogs naturally infected with Babesia canis . Blood samples were collected from 37 dogs infected with B. canis and showing clinical signs consistent with the disease. The sick animals were classified as dogs with physiologic and decreased red blood cell (RBC) values. Twenty-five healthy dogs formed the control group. The concentrations of total proteins and protein fractions were measured in blood serum. The values of total proteins, albumin and albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio in dogs with babesiosis were significantly lower than in healthy ones ( P &lt; 0.001). In the globulin fractions, significantly higher relative concentrations of α 1 -, β 1 - and β 2 -globulins ( P &lt; 0.01), and non-significantly higher values of α 2 - and γ-globulins were found in dogs with babesiosis with a double α 2 -zone in six out of 37 animals. Marked differences were observed also between the two groups of sick animals, with significantly lower values of albumin and A/G ratio ( P &lt; 0.05), and significantly higher values of α 1 - and β 1 -globulins in dogs with decreased RBC ( P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01, respectively). Presented results indicate marked alterations in the electrophoretic pattern of serum proteins in dogs with babesiosis suggesting its usefulness for the evaluation of pathophysiological changes caused by the disease and for diagnostic of disease severity.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the present study was to compare the effects of dietary oils containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) n-3 and n-6, respectively, on cutaneous wound healing in rats, and to demonstrate the usefulness of the matrix-assisted-laser-desorption-ionization mass spectroscopy-imaging (MALDI MSI) method in this type of experiment. Superiority of PUFA n-3 in this context was the tested hypothesis. Four groups of male Wistar rats by twelve animals each were fed a diet with added 5% of palm oil (P; control), fish oil (F), Schizochytrium microalga oil (Sch) and safflower oil (S), respectively, for eight weeks. Consequently, dorsal full-thickness cutaneous excisions were performed, and selected markers of wound healing were evaluated 18 days post excision. The median of signal intensity corresponding to an amount of collagen α-1 (III) fragment, quantified using MALDI MSI, decreased in a sequence P &gt; F &gt; Sch &gt; S ( P &lt; 0.001). Using haematoxylin-eosin staining of the histological preparations, semi-quantitatively assessed epithelium height tended to decrease in the order of P &gt; S &gt; Sch &gt; F; the wound extent in the sequence of P &gt; Sch &gt; S &gt; F; and the sequence of the progress of neo-angiogenesis was assessed as S &gt; P &gt; F ≈ Sch. It was concluded that the tested hypothesis was confirmed only partially: PUFA n-3 showed better results regarding the wound extent, but were inferior in terms of epithelium height and progress of neo-angiogenesis. This was the first time MALDI MSI was successfully employed for evaluating skin wound healing in a rat model.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the relationship of body condition and chewing time (CT) with body weight (BW), the level of cocaine-and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), leptin and energy metabolites in cows until reaching the lactation peak. The results showed the greatest loss of BW between days 11 and 45 of lactation and a decrease in the body condition score (BCS) until day 75. Chewing time showed an increase from day 45 with the highest values after lactation peak. The CART and leptin concentrations demonstrate a reduction of both indices ( P &lt; 0.05) between days 11 and 75. The function of leptin as a factor positively correlating with BW and BCS was found. In the heaviest individuals and those with higher BCS, the blood leptin levels were higher. The results of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) indicate that cows with the lowest BCS had the most intensive energy transformation. This led to a higher BHBA concentration compared to the cows with high BCS ( P &lt; 0.05). The obtained results show that CART was most strongly negatively associated with CT ( P &lt; 0.05). For leptin, the tendency was the opposite and the correlation with CT was not significant. The results suggest that CT may be stronger regulated by CART, which has anorectic properties, than by appetite inhibiting leptin. Significant decrease of body condition during lactation is a great problem for dairy farmers. The explanation of the issue of the participation of CART and leptin in the regulation of body’s energy homeostasis may therefore be of importance for milk production.",

    "abstract": "The study aimed to compare differences of physiological acid-base balance (ABB) parameters in follicular fluid (FF) and venous blood (VB) and to evaluate ABB parameters in FF collected from different ovarian follicles in dairy cows and heifers. The ABB parameters (pH, pCO 2 , pO 2 , HCO 3 – and base excess (BE)) in the FF of the preovulatory follicle, of the dominant follicle on the 9th day of the cycle and of the superovulatory estrous follicles were compared to VB. Similarly, the dynamics of the ABB profile in FF and VB were monitored in repeated sampling in a group of heifers stimulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Higher values of pH and pO 2 and lower values of pCO 2 , HCO 3 – and BE were found in FF compared to VB in all experiments. Laterality of ovaries, time of sampling, ovarian activity or stimulation of the follicular development by FSH did not significantly influence ABB parameters. We found higher pH (7.392 ± 0.027 vs. 7.364 ± 0.032) and pO 2 (13.83 ± 2.20 kPa vs. 4.50 ± 0.67 kPa), lower pCO 2 (5.70 ± 0.39 kPa vs. 6.54 ± 0.61 kPa), HCO 3 – (25.51 ± 1.52 mmol/l vs. 26.86 ± 2.12 mmol/l) and BE (1.14 ± 1.57 mmol/l vs. 1.95 ± 2.2 mmol/l) in FF compared to VB in all non-stimulated cows. Similar relationships between FF and VB were found in all FSH stimulated cows. The study provides as yet unknown knowledge on the physiology of follicular fluid in cattle.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to compare the efficiency, sensitivity and reliability of the MEAT 5.0 LCD-Array and innuDETECT Assay detection kits in identifying selected animal species. Samples were taken from the femoral muscles of six animal species (turkey, chicken, cattle, pig, sheep and goat), and six variants of binary meat mixtures were analysed at 18 different concentration levels of addition. The MEAT 5.0 LCD-Array test was able to detect 0.1% of other meat additions in two meat mixtures and 0.5% in four meat mixtures. The innuDETECT Assays were able to detect the addition of 0.1% of other meat in three meat mixtures, 0.5% in two mixtures and 1% in one meat mixture. Subsequently, these methods were applied in practice to 136 samples of various products taken from commercial food networks. By performing extensive monitoring, we identified 60 products in which one to three species were detected besides what was present on the product label. Nine products were contaminated with pig DNA. Two products that the MEAT 5.0 LCD-Array kit identified as positive for the presence of pig DNA were not confirmed by the innuDETECT Pork Assay kit. We recommend these methods of analysis to comprehensively monitor the presence of animal species in food samples, regardless of the degree of heat treatment or mechanical processing, as a tool to detect food adulteration.",

The multiplate method was composed of Bacillus subtilis BGA CCM 4062 plates (agar pH of 6, 8 and 7.2); Kocuria rhizophila CCM 552 plate, Geobacillus stearothermophilus CCM 5965 plate and Escherichia coli CCM 7372 plate. Geobacillus stearothermophilus plate showed the highest sensitivity. CCβ for the tested cephalosporins was determined at MRLs or lower, except for cefquinome, which was undetectable even at 12 × the MRL. Kocuria rhizophila plate showed the highest sensitivity to ceftiofur ( CCβ = 100 μg/l); cephazoline and cephalonium could not be detected even at 12 × times the MRL. Escherichia coli plate was most sensitive to cefoperazone ( CCβ = 60 μg/l). Other than cephapirine, none of the cephalosporins could be detected by B. subtilis BGA (pH 6, 8 and 7.2) plates even at 12 × the MRL. Our results demonstrate the differences in sensitivity to selected cephalosporins of the individual plate methods that together form the multi-plate method. The multi-plate method is sensitive enough to detect most of the tested cephalosporins, with the exception of cefquinome, which could not be detected at levels close to MRL.",

Various PCR procedures are available to detect mycoplasmas in cell cultures and bovine mycoplasma in different types of samples. We reviewed some common PCR techniques and specific primers targeted to different bacterial genetic regions of mycoplasma. Several researchers used the same PCR approach and Mycoplasma spp. as a target but their results could not be compared because different primer pairs were used. These methods and primers were first developed to identify mycoplasma species that contaminate animal cell cultures, and then were used by other researchers to differentiate mycoplasmas as a cow infecting agent. Our analysis of the specificity of these primer pairs to nucleotide sequences of five Mycoplasma spp. showed that oligonucleotides have less specificity to them. Numerous commercially available PCR kits are applicable to find mycoplasma contamination in cell cultures and fewer of them can be used in veterinary diagnostics. Although serological and culture techniques are still used, it is necessary to develop a new multiplex PCR technique with a more specific primer set especially in agrarian countries.",

The elective docking of a dog’s tail is illegal under both UK and Slovak law except for specific breeds that are intended to be used for specific purposes while the elective cropping of dogs’ ears is illegal under all circumstances. In the EU, there is much variation between countries with some having a total ban on these procedures and others allowing elective ear cropping specifically. Under the current UK as well as Slovak legislation there is no legal requirement for a central monitoring of the number of docking procedures undertaken, therefore it is not possible to analyse the efficacy of the legislation, specifically, the monitoring of the number of legally docked dogs that are not eventually used for the purpose for which their exemption was granted. There is also no certification scheme for dogs undergoing ear cropping legally in EU countries that permit it. It is suggested that greater monitoring be implemented of the eventual use of docked dogs and the EU granting proof of legality to ear cropped dogs in order to understand how great a risk is posed by illegal docking and cropping procedures.",

    "abstract": "The present report describes a novel approach to and presents the surgical results for laparoscopic hepatectomy of the left lobes in small dogs. A purely laparoscopic four-port approach was used in seven beagles. The left triangular ligament was cut first, then the base of the left medial lobe (LMB) was ligated with silk thread using a needle, and the liver parenchyma of the LMB approximately 0.5 cm above the ligation site was removed with LigaSure. The left lateral lobe (LLB) was removed in the same manner. Blood was collected on postoperative days 1, 3, 7, and 14 for laboratory testing. Left hepatic lobe resection was successfully completed in all dogs, with an average operation time of 102.53 ± 9.07 min and an average blood loss of 32.10 ± 6.43 ml. Serious postoperative complications were not observed. The white blood cell (WBC) count and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level were significantly increased in experimental dogs 1 day after surgery ( P &lt; 0.05); aspartate transferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) were significantly different before and after surgery ( P &lt; 0.01); and all the indicators were basically normal seven days after the operation. Exploratory laparoscopy at 28 days revealed adhesion of the surface of the liver section to the omentum or the gastric wall, but there were no other abnormal findings. The combined application of liver pedicle ligation and LigaSure for liver lobectomy provides a simple and effective method for generating liver lobectomy models for research on liver disease and regeneration and a feasible laparoscopic liver lobectomy operation scheme for small dogs (10–15 kg).",

    "abstract": "Serum albumin determination is an important biochemical investigation in clinical laboratories. Photometric methods using albumin binding to organic dyes – bromocresol green (BCG) or bromocresol purple (BCP) – are most commonly used. These determinations are quick, simple, and inexpensive. They are, however, associated with a number of problems. Discussions on the methodological unification and use of BCP are ongoing in human laboratory medicine. The reaction of human albumin with this dye is more specific. On the other hand, its affinity for animal albumin is significantly lower, for which reason BCG is used in veterinary medicine. However, due to the lower reaction specificity of this dye, the results are slightly overestimated as the dye reacts to a lesser extent with alpha and beta globulins. This disadvantage can be largely eliminated by reducing the incubation time to about 30 s. Another problem is the method calibration. Some laboratories use species-specific albumin as calibrators, but this is technically challenging for a laboratory that analyzes albumin of many species. We therefore recommend using a commercially available calibrator that is traceable to the European Reference Material for Specific Proteins. We consider these following principles – using BCG, shortening the incubation time to 30 s and using the mentioned calibrator – as a basic condition to obtain clinically correct and inter-laboratory comparable results.",

For this purpose, 90 cattle were used in the study. The length, width and circumference of the portio vaginalis of the cervix were measured ultrasonographically using a 5 MHz linear probe. In addition, the portio vaginalis of the cervix was ultrasonographically evaluated in terms of echogenicity, cystic formations, calcification and integrity of its borders. Regarding the colour Doppler ultrasonography, measurements of the vascular distribution category, vascular density and the vascular morphological appearance were made. In this study, it was found that the rate of irregularity of the border of the portio vaginalis in B-mode ultrasonography according to the pregnancy status was 10.9% in non-pregnant cows, while this was not observed in pregnant cows (0.0%). According to the metritis status, it was observed that the rate of regularity of the border of the portio vaginalis was higher in animals with metritis (45.5%) in B-mode ultrasonography. As a result, it was concluded that there were significant changes in the B-mode and colour Doppler ultrasonography characteristics of the portio vaginalis of the cervix in different physiological and pathological conditions in cattle, and that hypotheses can be developed regarding the fertility of the animals by evaluating these characteristics.",

Histological examination of the sample from this period showed hyperplasia of cells with a lobular structure. Immunohistochemistry staining demonstrated focal positivity to pancytokeratin. In the terminal stage (at 11 years of age), clinical examination revealed apathy, uncoordinated movement of the hind limbs, obstipation, anorexia and occasional vomiting with progressive weight loss. Skin inspection found multiple skin ulcerating tumorous lesions localized in the sacral region of the back and intercostally, partly fluctuating around the size 4 cm in diameter. Necropsy revealed an intraabdominal tumour localized among intestinal loops. Nodular lesions were found also in the lung parenchyma, on the dorsal surface of the epiglottis, in the myocardium, the cortex and the medulla of the kidneys, the adrenal gland, and in the intestinal wall. Histological analysis showed systemic production of fibrous nodules and formation of fibrous tissue with atrophy of parenchyma tissue. However, no connection between dermatofibrosis and adenocarcinoma of the kidney was found in this case, which was supplemented with pancytokeratin antibody. CD3 + lymphocytes were observed mainly in the zone of cell proliferation and in the interface towards the fibrous layer. Macrophages were seen mainly in the transitional zone between cellular and fibrous part. This indicated participation of monitored immunocompetent cells in fibroblast degradation.",

The animal material of the study consisted of a total of 75 dogs that appeared clinically healthy. Two ml of blood sample were taken from the vena cephalica antebrachii. Then, DNA extraction was performed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to amplify the 666 bp 18S rRNA gene region of Hepatozoon canis . Two positive PCR products were purified and sequenced. As a result of Nested-PCR, H. canis specific bands in 666 bp size were obtained in 7 (9.33%) out of 75 dogs. The result of sequence analysis, the nucleotide sequence was registered in the NCBI GenBank database with accession numbers OL467380.1-OL467538.1. Hepatozoon canis registered in GenBank of sequence OL467380.1 was found to be similar with other H. canis strains of registration numbers MW684292.1 with 99.69% and MH615006.1-MK091085.1-MF797806.1 with 99.53% rates; and the sequence with registration number OL467538.1 was found to be similar to the series MW684291.1 with 99.09% and MH615006.1-MK091085.1-KX 818220.1 with 99.08% rates by BLAST analysis. Hepatozoon canis prevalence of dogs in the Siirt province was determined as a result of this study.

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of different treatment protocols for the control of iron-deficiency anaemia and coccidiosis, one combination injection versus injection of iron and oral application of toltrazuril, on the general behaviour of piglets. Piglets were divided into three experimental treatment groups: 24 piglets were left untreated; (control group, C); 24 piglets received an oral administration of generic anticoccidial agent (20 mg/kg BW) plus intramuscular administration of iron dextran (200 mg/ml; 1 ml/piglet) in the same handling (oral + parenteral group, O+P) and 24 piglets received an intramuscular application of the combination product (parenteral group, P). As expected, the handling time was higher in the oral + parenteral group than in the parenteral group. Regarding the behaviour of piglets, the time spent suckling after treatment was variable in the control and oral + parenteral groups, while piglets from the parenteral group spent more time suckling, and hence, their time spent resting was decreased. A statistical trend of lower concentration of cortisol was observed in P compared to O+P after processing. Regarding productivity indices, the average daily gain of piglets during lactation and, subsequently, their weaning weight were higher in P compared to O+P, and similar to the control. In conclusion, administering a combination product injection decreases the time of administration compared to individual treatments.",

The spermatozoa quality indicators were appraised by computer-assisted semen analysis and a flow cytometer. Significant differences ( P &lt; 0.01) between bulls were registered in all indicators measured. The highest average values of spermatozoa total motility and viability were achieved using BULLXcell® extender (44.33%; 52.06%). Variances in comparing this extender with Optidyl® and AndroMed® were −0.83%, −2.64%; −8.33%, −9.51%. The differences found between the egg yolk-based diluents (BULLXcell® and Optidyl®) and AndroMed® were significant ( P &lt; 0.01). Therefore, the more valuable extenders for bull semen dilution were egg yolk-based extenders, which provided higher post-thaw spermatozoa survival and quality than the soy lecithin-based extender.",

    "abstract": "Classical swine fever is a highly contagious viral disease that affects domestic and wild suids and could cause important economic losses. It is the most dangerous infectious disease of the wild boar that can cause severe death in densely populated areas. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of endoparasites on the oral vaccination against classical swine fever in wild boar. The study compared classical swine fever antibody titres in wild boar treated and untreated with antiparasitics. Fourteen six-month-old wild boar piglets were tested via direct ELISA to detect specific antibodies in blood serum after vaccination. Before the vaccination, one group of piglets was administered antiparasitic therapy; the other group of animals remained untreated. Twenty-eight days post vaccination, piglets from the first group (free of parasites) showed significantly ( P = 0.0015) higher concentrations of specific antibodies than the infected animals. Obtained results proved that parasitic infections substantially influence the efficacy of oral vaccination against classical swine fever and may support the ability of the virus to produce infectious diseases and its transmission in the wild boar population. For that reason, antiparasitic therapy of wild boar populations before their vaccination is highly recommended in order to increase the vaccine’s efficacy.",

Altogether, 122 piglets (12 litters) were divided randomly into four groups (4 × 3 litters). Diet of the piglets in the control group was without popped amaranth grain. Starting from day 5 until day 90 of life, each of the three experimental groups was offered one of the feed mixtures containing different amounts of heat-treated popped amaranth grain: 20% (group A20), 40% (group A40), and 79% (group A79). When comparing the three experimental groups with the control group, in relation to the mean haemoglobin concentration and red blood cell count, higher values were measured in almost all periods of the piglets’ life, except for five-day-old piglets in the experimental groups. Only in 90-day-old piglets, group A79 tended to have a higher body weight compared to the control piglets. In summary, differences in haematologic indices which occurred between groups were inconsistent and of minor practical impact. With regard to the costs of the Amaranthus diet, beneficial effects were not obvious.",

The aim of the study was to assess the influence of genetic effects of selected genetic markers MyoD genes and RYR1 on the achieved indicators of muscle fibres in the musculus longissimus lumborum et thoracis (MLLT). The study included a total number of 216 hybrid pigs with the mean slaughter weight of 123 kg. Gene polymorphism was determined by the PCR-RFLP method. The gene polymorphism was determined in the RYR1, MYOD1, MYOG, and MYF6 genes . Muscle fibre types from MLLT were identified. Concerning the RYR1 gene, the study found that homozygous-dominant animals reached a lower number of type I (8.35 vs. 10.52; P &lt; 0.05) and a higher number of IIA (3.66 vs. 2.10; P &lt; 0.05) and a higher number of IIB (76.61 vs. 67.91; P &lt; 0.05). The maximum number in all types of muscle fibres reached BB genotype of the MYOG gene (type I: 14.02; IIA: 18.47; IIB: 83.08; P &lt; 0.05). The AA genotype of the MYOD1 gene showed the lowest ( P &lt; 0.05) number of muscle in all fibre types (type I: 9.20; IIA: 0.85; IIB: 69.23). The influence of individual genotypes of selected genes on the selected muscle fibre characteristics was proven.

In the present study, the effect of the parasite-host system of Ligula intestinalis and Abramis brama on the mercury concentrations and fish muscle composition of infected and non-infected fish was evaluated. Nine parasitized and seven non-parasitized fish were studied. The total mercury content in the samples was determined by the atomic-absorption spectrophotometry method. Standard indicators of the chemical composition of muscles (dry matter, crude protein, fats, and ash) and a spectrum of fatty acids were evaluated. The mean mercury concentration in the biomass of plerocercoids was 0.045 ± 0.025 mg·kg -1 ; about × 7 lower compared to fish muscles. The mean mercury concentration in the muscles of infected and non-infected fish was 0.36 ± 0.11 and 0.24 ± 0.1, respectively. There was no difference in the composition of fish muscles and the spectrum of fatty acids. Ligula intestinalis takes nutrients from the fish body but according to the results of our study, the withdrawal of the monitored nutrients was uniform without any selection. Mercury is not efficiently accumulated by plerocercoids of Ligula intestinalis . This study brings novel data for this heavy metal and for this parasite host system.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the present paper was to verify whether the method of studying the anaerobic degradability of organic matter of excrements could reveal the utilization of dietary organic matter in the digestive tract of ruminants in relation to the lactation period, and whether it could be replaced by a cheaper and easier method of acid hydrolysis of excrements. Changes in anaerobic degradability and hydrolysis yields of excrements were investigated in an experimental herd of 30 cows divided into two groups differing in their lactation period by 30 days. The results document that anaerobic degradability is a suitable indicator of anaerobic digestion conditions in the digestive tract of animals and of the fitness of their organism. However, the results of excrement hydrolysis according to the Rovira and Vallejo (2002) method were hardly reproducible and so they could not be used, when only the very labile organic fraction is evaluated. The evaluation of the sum of very labile fractions and semi-labile fraction provides easily available values, but these are only orientative values that cannot replace the costly and labour-consuming determination of anaerobic degradability of excrements.",

In this study, the effects of emulsified isoflurane and propofol-isoflurane on the endocrine function were compared in dogs. Sixteen dogs were randomly divided into two groups: one group (G1) of dogs were induced with intravenous 5 mg/kg propofol and maintained with inhaled 2–2.5% inspiratory isoflurane in 100% oxygen; second group (G2) of dogs were induced with intravenous 1 ml/kg emulsified isoflurane and maintained with intravenous 8 ml/kg/h emulsified isoflurane. Blood samples to determine the endocrine function were collected prior to induction of anaesthesia and at 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 2 h, 6 h, and 24 h after drug administration. Serum triiodothyronine and tetraiodothyronine concentrations in G1 increased significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) at 15 min and were higher than in G2. Serum insulin at 15 min and 30 min were significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) higher in both G1 and G2. Serum insulin in G1 was higher after anaesthesia than in G2. Serum glucagon decreased at 15 min, 30 min, and 60 min, without significant changes ( P &gt; 0.05). Serum glucose increased at 15 min and 30 min after anesthesia, and was significantly higher in G1 than in G2 ( P &lt; 0.05) at 60 min. In conclusion, both emulsified isoflurane and propofol-isoflurane anaesthesia affected triiodothyronine, tetraiodothyronine, and insulin in dogs, but emulsified isoflurane anaesthesia had a minimal effect on triiodothyronine and tetraiodothyronine. With its less deleterious effect on the endocrine function, emulsified isoflurane may be more suitable for canine anaesthesia.",

The dog was referred to the Internal Medicine Department Policlinics with the symptoms of anorexia, weakness, swollen joints and ulcerative wounds on testes. On physical examination, the dog was depressed and manifesting discomfort during manipulation of the fore and hind legs’ joints. There were palpable effusions of the right carpal, elbow, and tibiotarsal joints. Haematological and serum biochemical analyses showed mild anaemia, moderate thrombocytopaenia, and elevated alanine aminotransferase. As soon as the synovial fluid aspirates were obtained aseptically from the right elbow, radiocarpal, and tibiotarsal joints, they were sent to bacteriological examination. Symptomatic and supportive treatment was initiated immediately. Empirical enrofloxacin therapy was initially started. Bacteria which were cultivated from the synovial fluid aspirates specimen were identified as S. equisimilis . The isolate was found to be resistant to enrofloxacin and susceptible to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid. According to the results of the antimicrobial susceptibility tests, enrofloxacin therapy was terminated and amoxycillin/clavulanic acid therapy was immediately started lasting for four weeks. The dog was treated successfully. To our knowledge, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis was isolated from the synovial fluid from a dog for the first time in Turkey, as it is rarely seen in dogs.",

    "abstract": "The process of gluconeogenesis in ruminants is under the direct influence of insulin and glucocorticoid hormones. The goal of this study was to determine the effects of added Na-propionate on the neuroendocrine regulation of blood glucose in calves at three specific physiological periods: on exclusive milk nutrition; on mixed milk and forage nutrition; and with established ruminant digestion. The influence of Na-propionate on blood glucose, insulin and cortisol concentrations was examined in the same 20 female Holstein calves at different stages of forestomach development (15 days, 2 months, and 4 months of age of calves). Group 1 of calves (n = 10) received Na-propionate intravenously; group 2 (n = 10) received Na-propionate mixed in milk. Blood sampling was performed 1 and 3 h after Na-propionate administration. After i.v. administration of Na-propionate, a significant increase ( P &lt; 0.05) in blood glucose concentration was observed 1 h after administration only in calves aged 2 and 4 months; blood insulin concentration was significantly higher ( P &lt; 0.01) 1 and 3 h after i.v. administration in 2-month-old calves; and cortisol concentration increased ( P &lt; 0.01) 1 h after administration in each selected calf in all testing periods. Orally administered Na-propionate led to a significant increase ( P &lt; 0.01) of insulin concentration 1 and 3 h after administration in 15-day-old calves, and 3 h after administration in 2-month-old calves. Based on these results it could be assumed that i.v. and p.o. administration of Na-propionate affects the neuroendocrine regulation of glycaemia in calves of different age.",

    "abstract": "Immunophenotyping is a widely used method for a precise diagnosis and classification of haematopoietic neoplasia in human beings and also in dogs. The gold standard for cell preparation is density gradient centrifugation of mononuclear cells. Alternatively, another way to separate human leukocytes is carrying out whole blood lysis. The aim of this study was to validate whole blood lysis as an alternative method in clinical veterinary procedures using an immunophenotype panel of leukocytes designed by our group. Flow cytometry study of adult canine leukocytes subset groups, using whole blood lysis or mononuclear cells tested against an array of canine leukocyte antibodies were done. Besides differential white blood cell counts were done. Also immunophenotyping studies in whole blood samples stored at 4 °C for 48 h were performed. The Coefficient Variation values were less than 20%, for most of the comparison. Consistent results were observed in phenotyping canine peripheral blood leukocytes. Stability results indicated that whole blood samples might be stored for 48 h without a significant difference in the data compared to samples processed immediately after blood collection. This study shows that whole blood lysis represents an efficient and quick alternative for canine leukocyte preparation. In addition, samples can be analysed immediately or stored for 48 h without a significant difference between them. This is relevant for veterinary medicine considering the lack of facilities in many laboratories to process samples.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this research was to study the effect of vacuum packaging on selected microbiological, chemical and sensory properties of cold-smoked common carp ( Cyprinus carpio ) and cold-smoked bighead carp ( Hypophthalmichthys nobilis ) fillets stored at 3 ± 0.5 °C, and to determine the shelf life of the products. Fillets were analysed on days 1, 7, 10,12, 14, 15 and 16. The total viable count was significantly higher ( P &lt; 0.01) in common carp samples than in bighead carp samples from storage day 12. At the end of experiment, the numbers of TVC in both groups of samples had not reached the value of 7 log cfu/g. No significant differences ( P &gt; 0.05) were determined between the psychrotrophic viable counts in common carp and bighead carp samples during the whole period of storage. In cold-smoked bighead carp samples, lactic acid bacteria were the dominant micro-organisms at the end of storage period. Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. were not detected in any of the examined samples. The pH values in both samples groups were quite stable and ranged from 5.97 ± 0.08 to 6.18 ± 0.07 in cold-smoked common carp, and from 5.80 ± 0.08 to 5.98 ± 0.06 in bighead carp samples. The total volatile basic nitrogen concentration increased during the storage period in both groups of samples. Based on sensory evaluation, it was concluded that vacuum-packaged cold-smoked common carp samples remained acceptable up to 15 days of storage, whereas vacuum-packaged cold-smoked bighead carp samples remained unchanged until the end of the experiment.",

    "abstract": "The assessment of fangs is a fundamental part of clinical examination of viperid snakes. The long curved venom fang is carried by short, highly mobile maxilla. Short anaesthesia is advised for safe physical examination and radiography of the mouth cavity. The fangs are gently forced outside the fang pocket by passing the bar or forceps on the palato-maxillary arch, and rotating them rostrally shifting the mucosal fold. Functional fangs are periodically shed and several generations of replacement teeth lie behind and beneath each fang. In case of fang fracture, therapy should be limited to flushing with a solution of chlorhexidine or povidone iodine, and topical application of pro-coagulant and antibacterial cream. Therapy of chronic fang inflammation is based on removal of necrotized fang and repeated abundant irrigation of the fang pocket. Treatment of chronic stomatitis consists of flushing with chlorhexidine or povidone iodine, physical removal of the plaques, administration of analgesics and antibiotics (marbofloxacin, enrofloxacin or ceftazidime). Extra-oral surgical approach is the best method for odontogenic abscess removal. A vigorous flushing with sterile saline solution, chlorhexidine and povidone iodine and topical application of antibiotics (antibiotic embedded surgical sponge) is advised. Force feeding of the anorectic patient suffering from fang inflammation is a mandatory part of the standard treatment protocol.",

    "abstract": "Conazoles are azole antifungals used in agricultural and pharmaceutical products. Exposure to conazole fungicides leads to several toxic endpoints, including reproductive and endocrine. The results of animal experiments have shown that various conazole fungicides at high doses affect the structure and functions of reproductive organs. In males, adverse effects of conazole fungicides are manifested in the testes, prostate, sperm viability, fertility and sexual behaviour. Reduced testis weight, testis atrophy and reduced or absent sperm production were frequently observed. In female genitalia, structural changes in the ovaries and uterus have been observed. The extent of the changes depends on the dose and duration of treatment. Triazoles affected the expression of multiple genes involved in steroid hormone metabolism and modulate enzyme activity of multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP) and other metabolic enzymes in mammalian liver and other tissues. Conazole fungicides act as endocrine disruptors. Conazoles have been reported to reduce oestradiol and testosterone production and to increase progesterone concentration, indicating the inhibition of enzymes involved in the conversion of progesterone to testosterone. The reproductive effects are consistent with impairment of testosterone homeostasis. The disruption in steroid homeostasis is a common mode of action, leading to abnormal reproductive development and diminished reproductive function. At high doses, azole fungicides affect reproductive organs and fertility in several species.",

    "abstract": "Manual therapies, physiotherapy, and modalities are often used as a treatment and prophylactic method for preventing various injuries, as well as a rehabilitation tool in the post-operative, traumatic period for horses. Significant results have been achieved with these therapies: increased joint range of motion, tissue extensibility, and reduced pain and inflammation. This study evaluated the effect of osteopathic manual therapy (OMT) on the nervous and immune systems, as well as on the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. To assess changes in these systems, non-invasive biomarkers were chosen: the heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), temperature (T), as well as objective measurements: blood serum cortisol (BSC) concentration and white blood cell (WBC) count. A total of 30 thoroughbred horses were randomly divided into an experimental group (n = 15) and a control group (n = 15). Blood samples and physiological indicator measurements such as HR, RR, T, BSC and WBC were taken before (p0), after (p1) and one hour after (p2) the OMT treatment for the experimental group. Analogical sequence was performed for the control group without OMT. A significant increase of BSC by 0.94 µg/dl after OMT suggest a direct influence on the HPA axis. Also, a substantial decrease of WBC by 0.57 × 10 9 /l indicates the immune system’s response to the treatment. Moreover, an observed significant decrease in HR and RR shows that the autonomic nervous system was affected by activating the parasympathetic nervous system. Based on the results obtained, it is concluded that OMT has an effect on the HPA axis and on the nervous and immune systems.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate data on doping controls in racehorses over a given ten-year period, primarily to identify positive findings and to summarise recommendations for the prevention of accidental contamination with prohibited substances, where appropriate. Data on doping controls of racehorses in the Czech Republic from 2010 to 2019 were obtained from the archives of the Jockey Club of the Czech Republic. For each year, the total number of horses starting at races held in the Czech Republic, the number of horses tested, and the results of the doping controls were determined. Data on the type of samples, positive findings and statements from responsible persons about the cause of the positive finding were recorded. During the monitoring period, 11,852 horses competed in races in the Czech Republic and 641 of them underwent a doping control. Blood was taken from 356 horses as the sample for testing and urine was collected from 285 horses. A total of 13 positive findings (2.03% of the 641 tested) were found during the period, namely of morphine, caffeine, theobromine, omeprazole sulphide, furosemide, clenbuterol, norketamine, ritalinic acid, dexamethasone, flunixin, hydroxylidocaine and oripavine. The most common cause, in a total of seven horses, was confirmed as suspected feed contamination. Prevention of positive doping results in our circumstances should therefore be directed primarily towards compliance with proper feed and stable management.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the possible protective effects of Tarantula cubensis extract (TCE) on the liver and brain of rats exposed to gentamicin (GM). A total of 40 male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into four equal groups: control, TCE, GM, and GM+TCE. Some biochemical indices, apoptotic markers (B-cell lymphoma 2 [Bcl-2] and Bcl-2 associated X protein [Bax]) and histopathological changes were evaluated. In the GM group, serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), total bilirubin, brain and liver tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations increased; albumin, total protein, brain and liver tissue superoxide dismutase (SOD) concentrations and the total antioxidant status (TAS) decreased. Apoptosis induced down-regulation of Bcl-2 and up-regulation of Bax in liver and brain tissues in the GM group. GM-treated animals demonstrated several histopathological changes. TCE administration restored some histopathological changes. Lipid peroxidation and apoptosis decreased, antioxidant defense increased, concentrations of some serum biochemical indices (AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, and total bilirubin) decreased, and albumin and total protein levels increased in the TCE+GM group compared to the GM group. In conclusion, high doses of GM induce adverse effects on liver and brain tissue of rats. It was concluded that TCE administration can improve these adverse effects by reducing lipid peroxidation and apoptosis, improving the antioxidant defense system. TCE can be used to protect against the toxic effect of GM and other chemical agents in the liver and brain in veterinary medicine. However, additional studies are needed to confirm this assumption.",

Genetic selection based on markers that affect the molecular synthesis and degradation of the two main compounds of boar taint - androstenone and skatole - appears to be one of the possibilities. Many genes and their expression profiles associated with androstenone and skatole levels are known, and studies usually analyse them in hybrids. Our study focused on pure pig breeds and their comparison in the genotypes of the CYP2E1 , TEAD3 , HSD3B , and CYB5A genes. We examined four common commercial breeds (Large White, Landrace, Pietrain, Duroc) and compared them with the original Czech autochthonous Přeštice Black Pied breed, which is also classified as a gene source, with the breed being highlighted for its meat quality. Our research shows that there are differences between purebred individuals. Due to breeding programs, genotyping of breeding boars and sows is not only possible but also relevant.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the housing system on the behaviour, performance, and health of dairy calves. The two-year study was conducted on 56 Holstein bull calves (from birth to 60 days of age) that were placed in individual hutches immediately after their birth. At the age of 31 days, 28 bull calves were moved to group hutches by four. The calves were weighed at birth, at 30 days, and at 60 days of age. The starter intake and health were recorded once a day. The behavioural activities of calves (lying, standing and cross-sucking, etc.) were analysed in 24-h cycles at 38 days and 53 days of age. The results showed that group-housed calves spent less time lying and resting ( P &lt; 0.01) and more time standing ( P &lt; 0.01), receiving the starter ( P &lt; 0.05), drinking ( P &lt; 0.01), cross-sucking ( P &lt; 0.01), and social playing ( P &lt; 0.01) compared to individually housed calves. Conversely, calves from individually housing spent more time licking the housing surfaces ( P &lt; 0.05) and individual playing ( P &lt; 0.05). Bull calves housed from day 31 of age in the group hutches achieved a non-significantly higher body weight at weaning (by +3.0 kg), weight gain (by +2.8 kg), and a significantly higher ( P &lt; 0.05) starter intake (by +7.9 kg) compared to the individually housed calves. These results showed that housing in small groups allowed for the natural behaviour of calves and improved their growth without having adverse effects on their health.",

This research was carried out to determine the prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. by microscopic and molecular methods and to determine subtypes in 100 calves up to 6 months old and with diarrhoea in the Siirt Province, Türkiye. As a result of the microscopic examination (Kinyoun’s acid-fast), Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts were found in 8 (8%) of 100 samples. As a result of nested PCR, 826-864 bp specific bands for Cryptosporidium spp. were obtained in 13 (13%) of 100 samples. When the DNA sequences of the SSU rRNA gene were compared with the NCBI Basic Local Alignment Search Tool database, it was determined that eight samples sequence analyses showed 100% similarity with the C. parvum , C. ryanae , and C. bovis samples. The detection of C. parvum , which has zoonotic importance in this study, suggests that calves with diarrhoea may be a source of contamination for other animals and humans. Therefore, animal owners and people in close contact with animals should be informed about the public health of cryptosporidiosis.",

Thirty individuals of market carp caught in three ponds (Jaroslavicky, Strachotin, Vrkoc) located in the Morava River basin in the Czech Republic were used for this study. Total mercury was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry on AMA 254 device. The highest total mercury content was found in the muscle of carp (7.6 ± 2.8 µg·kg -1 in Jaroslavicky, 6.8 ± 2.3 µg·kg -1 in Vrkoc, and 12.9 ± 4.3 µg·kg -1 in Strachotin), followed by levels in caudal kidney, liver, spleen, and brain; the lowest mercury content was determined in gonads and scales. The comparison revealed that individual localities significantly differ in the mercury content in muscle, caudal kidney, liver and spleen samples. However, in all cases the values of the mercury content in muscle complied with the hygienic limit of up to 0.3 mg·kg -1 , which means that mercury does not pose a risk to the consumers of these pond farmed fish and that the benefits of eating fish meat outweigh the potential risk in terms of mercury content.",

    "abstract": "In laboratory rats, dominance manifests as agonistic behaviour that damages social bonds between individuals. In this study, the effect of the housing system and environmental enrichment on the social dominance in male Wistar rats was assessed in the social dominance tube test. Rats were housed in different housing systems (individual vs. social housing, with or without enrichment) from weaning and tested at the age of 7 weeks. In each test, two rats from different housing systems were released into opposite ends of a narrow tube and the rat that forced its opponent out of the tube was declared the winner (the more dominant animal). In this way, all possible combinations of housing systems were tested and number of wins were recorded and percentage of the total number of matches was calculated. The results show that environmental enrichment suppresses ( P &lt; 0.001) dominant behaviour in individually housed rats while no such effect was seen in socially housed male rats ( P = 0.532). However, social housing combined with enrichment was more effective in reduction of dominant behaviour compared to only providing enrichment for individually housed rats. Reduction of variability in the manifestations of dominant behaviour is important in animals used for experimental purposes from the perspective of greater homogeneity of animals, which ensures obtaining valid research results and at the same time better living conditions for laboratory animals.",

    "abstract": "Protection against water- and air-borne bacteria as well as their detection at very low levels is a big challenge for the health care profession. The study’s main goal was to prepare bacterial filters with a tunable trapping effectivity. We revealed that the trapping efficiency of Escherichia coli estimated from the optical density of bacteria passed through the filter was exponentially dependent on the surface density of the polyacrylonitrile nanofibre membranes. This log/linear regression profile was proven for bacterial trapping efficiency higher than 99.9% which opens a door for easy and tunable constructions of ultrasensitive filters and/or nanosensors as well as for the standardization and quality control of nanofibre membranes.",

The use of methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) as an adjunct to surgical decompression in cases of acute spinal cord injury following intervertebral disc extrusion is controversial. A prospective study was undertaken to compare the perioperative use of MPSS and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in 40 chondrodystrophic dogs presenting with similar signs and undergoing spinal decompressive surgery. Twenty dogs received MPSS and 20 had NSAIDs administered preoperatively. Dogs were administered with either MPSS intravenously 20 min before surgery (30 mg/kg) or NSAID (meloxicam 0.2 mg/kg or carprofen 4 mg/kg) subcutaneously 20 min before surgery. Dogs were evaluated by neurological examination of gait 24 h postoperatively, at time of discharge, and then at 8 weeks. The neurological recovery was similar in both groups, but the frequency of side effects such as vomiting (MPSS group: 90% vs NSAIDs group: 55%), and anorexia within the first three days (present in all 20 dogs pretreated with MPSS) was significantly different, with complications being more prevalent in the MPSS group. This study showed that side effects were significantly more evident with the MPSS treatment group than with the NSAID group, with a neurological recovery similar in both groups.",

From the obtained questionnaire data we selected the rural cats (R, n = 54) and compared them with urban cats (U, n = 144). The R group cats lived predominantly in family houses, U cats in urban apartments. The pressures of physical and social factors in the small niches of urban apartments (dwellings in Czech urban high-density living settings, though comfortable, are smaller than in numerous European countries; they prevailed in our U group) resulted in statistically significant differences in only 31 (51.7%) out of 60 traits under study. Among them, 15 (68.2%) out of 22 concerned the conduct of household members, and 16 (42.1%) out of 38 concerned the behaviour of their cats. Thus the conduct of people in U households showed relatively higher proportion of changes than the behaviour of their cats. U onwers more frequently purchased their cats (R = 24.1%, U = 48.6%, chi-square = 10.648, df = 4, p &lt; 0.05), they kept the cat pedigrees (R = 37.0%, U = 75.4%, chisquare = 24.661, df = 1, p &lt; 0.001), paid more attention to their cats ((R = 93.0%, U = 100.0%, chi-square = 8.950, df = 1, p &lt; 0.005), talked to them daily (R = 87.0%, U = 98.6%, chi-square = 12.024, df = 1, p &lt; 0.001), allowed them to use furniture (R = 77.8%, U = 100.0%, chi-square = 33.839, df = 1, p &lt; 0.001), sleep in beds of family members (R = 61.1%, U = 95.1%, chi-square = 37.149, df = 1, p &lt; 0.001), and celebrated their birthdays (R = 25.9%, U = 100.0%, chi-square = 7.014, df = 2, p &lt; 0.05). Their cats were more destructive than R cats, hunted less and were less aggressive when stroked. However, they showed a slightly larger scope of aggressive behaviours and were more frequently described as nervous and restless. The nature of the significant differences found in this study indicates that the co-existence of cats with people in the urbanized world is becoming more intimate. More interactions occur between the two species. The relationships between people and their cats deserve further study not only in order to gain more insight but also for a practical application of this knowledge.",

The next aim of our work was to determine the mitogenic activity of ovine amniotic fluid fractions of peptide nature on benzo-á-pyrene transformed BALB/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts (BPA31 cells) by use of 3 H-thymidine incorporation into nucleus DNA and in conclusion, to compare the mitogenic activity of ruminant amniotic fluid fractions on different indicator cells. According to our study, inhibiting effect was found only in the case of separated bovine amniotic fluid (Peak I) and ovine amniotic fluid (B fraction). On the other hand, we have observed activation of lymphocytes by other fraction of bovine amniotic fluid (Peak II) and also of BP- A31 cells by fraction A in case of ovine amniotic fluid. The proliferation of peripheral lymphocytes was not significantly changed after the addition of natural bovine amniotic fluid likewise when the delipidated ovine amniotic fluid was added to BP-A31 cells, there was no effect on 3 H-thymidine incorporation. Our results suggest that with testing the proliferation effect, the selection of indicator cells is of great importance since various cell types respond in different ways to the same substances.",

The studies were conducted on 10 young Wielkopolska breed stallions for two years; Group A: 1-month-old, Group B: 3-month-old, Group C: 6-month-old, Group D: 1-year-old, and Group E: 2-year-old. ATP, ADP and AMP concentrations in the erythrocytes were determined by HPLC. 2,3-BPG was determined using the Calbiochem USA kit. We observed that erythrocyte ATP, ADP, AMP and TAN concentrations significantly decreased with age ( p &lt; 0.001), while 2,3-BPG concentration and AEC values significantly increased with age. A significant correlation between the ATP and TAN concentrations was found within all the examined groups ( p &lt; 0.05). A significant correlation was also found between ATP concentration and AEC values (except 12 month-old stallions). Moreover, an age-dependent negative correlation between ATP and 2,3-BPG (r = -0.81) was found. The conclusion is that the adenylate energy charge and erythrocyte 2,3-BPG variables in the Wielkopolska stallions mainly depend on age, thus warranting the use of specific age-related reference values for this breed's foals.",

    "abstract": "Insulin is a hormone essentially involved in the blood glucose level regulation, besides it acts on cell growth and development of a several variety of cell types, including the ovarian cells. In general, the effects of this hormone in ovarian cells of mammals are positive, it stimulates in granulosa cells proliferation, aromatase activity and steroid production, also it is a factor that regulates the oocyte maturation. Therefore, this review described the main biological effects of insulin in female mammalian reproduction, with emphasis on ovarian folliculogenesis, oocyte maturation and embryonic development. This paper shows the structure and action aspects of insulin and its receptor, the presence of insulin and its receptor in the ovary and the role of this hormone in female reproduction. Insulin is an anabolic hormone produced by pancreatic  cells. Its action starts in the cell by binding to the in cell plasma membrane receptor. In the ovarian environment, insulin is an important modulator of follicular development, steroidogenesis, oocyte maturation and subsequent embryonic development. Thus, metabolic hormones such as insulin regulate the follicular development by modulating the follicular recruitment, development and maturation. Despite significant scientific advances that have occurred on the mechanisms of insulin action, there is yet to be better explained its effects on folliculogenesis in mammals, as well as the influence of these effects in the subsequent maturation of oocytes grown in vitro.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Embryo, oocyte, ovarian follicle, receptor.",

Samples of honeys were collected from small producers, in three districts (Mossoro, Apodi, Caraubas) of Rio Grande do Norte State. The samples were fractionated and first aliquots were immediately analyzed, while the second ones were stored under room temperature (25 ± 2 oC and RH 70±5%) for eight months, and then analyzed. The physicochemical parameters evaluated were: humidity, pH, acidity, reducing sugars, apparent sucrose, electrical conductivity and color. The statistical analysis was descriptive, and a distribution of frequencies according to Scott's Criterion was applied. The physicochemical characteristics of the samples from different districts reached the minimum quality requirement, established by the Brazilian Legislation for floral honey. In spite of the variation in the color of the honeys from white to clear amber after the storage period, the honeys did not presented any alterations in the quality characteristic which allow their commercialization after eight months of storage.",

    "abstract": "A feira livre tem um importante papel na comercializacao de produtos carneos, principalmente em pequenas cidades. No entanto, com a mudanca no comportamento do mercado consumidor, que tem valorizado outras formas de comercio, a feira tem perdido espaco como canal de distribuicao. Logo, objetivou-se avaliar a percepcao dos consumidores de carnes de feiras livres quanto as condicoes higienicas de comercializacao e conhecimento dos riscos a saude na aquisicao destes produtos. Para tanto foram entrevistados 400 consumidores de cinco municipios do agreste meridional pernambucano, os quais foram questionados sobre a frequencia de consumo, tipo de carne consumida, condicoes de exposicao e comercializacao das carnes e condicoes higienicas dos mercados de carne. A carne preferida e a bovina, com consumo diario por 240 (60%) entrevistados, seguida da carne de frango. Em relacao aos aspectos higienicos 187 (46,8%) entrevistados classificaram as feiras como regular, 93 (23,2%) como boa, 69 (17,2%) e 51 (12,8%) como pessima ou ruim, respectivamente. Quanto a forma de comercializacao, 210 (52,5%) entrevistados a consideraram inadequada em virtude da presenca de animais, exposicao a poeira, manipulacao da carne pelos consumidores, a exposicao em ganchos, alem da falta de refrigeracao. A veiculacao de doencas pela contaminacao do produto era conhecida apenas por 160 entrevistados (40%), sendo brucelose e febre aftosa as doencas mais citadas como transmissiveis. Conclui-se que e necessaria uma acao preventiva direcionada a reestruturacao das feiras, capacitacao dos comerciantes e programas de promocao a saude, em virtude dos riscos aos quais a populacao esta exposta.",

This report refers to the description of ingestion cases of weird foreign bodies by three jabuti piranga (Chelonoidis carbonaria) from keepers in Sergipe, Brazil. The animals were sent for medical care with a history of apathy, prostration, loss of appetite and constipation. After anamnesis and clinical evaluation the specimens were submitted to simple ventrodorsal radiographs that confirmed the presence of radiopaque material in the digestive tract. Therapeutic procedures were different and one of the animals died due to the seriousness of his condition. From that report we concluded that the occurrence of ingestion of foreign bodies may occur when treatment is inadequate.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Reptiles, digestive tube, foreign body.",

Therefore, the objective was to report the electrocardiogram (ECG) changes of a female 8 months old dog, poodle, with asymptomatic stenosis of the pulmonary valve before and after therapy the basis of enalapril and atenolol. Physical examination was observed tachycardia and pulmonary systolic murmur grade V / VI and tricuspid grade III / VI, with the diagnosis confirmed through radiographic, ECG and echocardiographic examinations, and therapy based on enalapril maleate (0.50 mg / kg) once daily and atenolol (0.25 mg / kg) every 12 hours, both orally. Initially, the ECG showed sinus tachycardia (250 bpm) and an increase in amplitude of the waves PmV, SmV and TmV, suggesting atrial and right ventricular myocardial hypoxia, cardiac axis deviation to the right. At 15, 90, 120 and 210 days of therapy subsequent ECGs showed sinus rhythm with a gradual reduction in heart rate and amplitude values of P waves, S and TmV. The changes described suggest improvement of the electrocardiographic tracing due to the reduction in pre-and post-cardiac load, obtained through therapy. Therefore, we concluded that the ECG performed during the seven months subsequently showed electrocardiographic changes that demonstrate the benefits of therapy based on enalapril maleate associated with atenolol in the dog with pulmonary valve stenosis.",

The results revealed that hematological changes were remarkably inconstant at evaluated dogs, most ones presenting unregenerative anemia; another frequent finding was leucopenia. Furthermore, proteinogram from all studied dogs presented some disturbance; the most frequent were hyperproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia, hyperglobulinemia, hypergammaglobulinemia, and reduction on albumin/globulins ratio. The electrophoretic profile revealed polyclonal gammopathy. Thus, it was concluded that hematologic and serum proteins electrophoretic profiles are valuable tools for help on diagnostic of canine visceral leishmaniasis.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Leishmania, serum proteins, proteinogram, albumin, globulins, hematology.",

The aim of our study was to observe the influence of simulated, long-term microgravity on the spongy bone tissue of the femur in Japanese quails. A total of 80 cockerels at the age of 2 days were exposed to simulated microgravity – hypodynamy. After days 56, 63, 90 and 180, six birds from the experimental group and six birds from the control group were euthanised. Samples for histological examination were collected from femur epiphysis. The whole femur of the other limb was used for the analysis of the calcium content. Microscopic examination showed differences between experimental and control animals in the spongy bone tissue after every day of the experiment. In the experimental animals, there were numerous, big, multinucleated cells osteoclasts, lying on the bone trabeculae surface, which were damaged. The highest difference in the calcium content in femurs between the control and experimental animals was found after 90 days of hypodynamy. This study builds on short-term hypodynamy experiments; such long periods had never been studied before in birds. Because our findings are similar to those found in osteoporotic bone tissue, it could by useful in the development of countermeasures against the negative influence of microgravity and immobilization.",

Birds were divided into two groups fed a control diet and a diet contaminated with DON (n = 20 in each). Feed intake was measured daily and individual live weight weekly; daily weight gain and feed to gain ratio were calculated. Five animals from each group were euthanized on days 21 and 39 when blood (blood plasma and red blood cell haemolysates) and liver samples were collected. Concentration of triglyceride, uric acid and glucose and activities of ALT, AST and LDH were measured in blood plasma. Indicators of lipid peroxide and glutathione redox status, malondialdehyde and reduced glutathione concentration and glutathione-peroxidase activity were measured in blood plasma, red blood cell haemolysates and liver homogenates. The low dose of DON did not cause difference in the production traits, but caused significantly lower concentration of uric acid and glucose, and significantly higher concentration of triglyceride in blood plasma on day 21. Enzyme activities in blood plasma did not differ significantly between the treatment groups. Among the markers of lipid peroxide and glutathione redox status, malondialdehyde content was significantly higher in liver homogenate on day 21 in the group fed with DON contaminated diet, but reduced glutathione content and glutathione peroxidase activity did not differ significantly between the treatment groups. The results showed that diet contaminated even with a low content of deoxynivalenol caused alterations in selected biochemical indicators of blood and liver of broiler chicken.",

    "abstract": "Rapid developments in the field of molecular genetics have led to new possibilities to identify polymorphic genes and to detect quantitative trait loci with major effects on economically important reproduction traits. Our study has defined the influence of polymorphism at position 3469 of the leptin gene on reproductive performance in sows as well as on selected blood biochemical indices in pregnant sows The research involved 173 multiparous sows after the second and third farrowing, crossbreds of Polish Large White and Polish Landrace breeds. The collected data on reproductive performance of sows concerned the number of live births, the number of weaned piglets and the length of weaning-to-estrus interval in the sows. Parities from the first to the fourth were analysed. A sample of blood was collected from each sow in the third month of pregnancy in order to isolate and then analyse DNA with the use of the PCR-RFLP methods. Blood biochemical analyses were performed as well. Two alleles of the leptin-coding gene (T and C ) were found in examined herd. In the second parity, where the live birth number was concerned, the difference between the CC (10.4) and TT (9.0) leptin genotypes proved to be significant ( P ≤ 0.05). Analyses of blood biochemical indices revealed virtually no significant differences between the genotypes compared. However, it was noted that the glucose concentration was the highest in the sows with TT genotype and the lowest in the sows with CC genotype.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of chronic hypodynamia on the structure of the vestibular apparatus in Japanese quail by light microscopy. Morphological changes in the sensory epithelium of chicks reared under hypodynamia from 1 to 42 days of age were evaluated. The differences of shape and arrangement of hair cells in sensory epithelium macula utriculi and the dilatations on their basal parts were found in birds exposed to hypodynamia on day 14 and 42 compared to control. The results confirmed that hypodynamia has specific impact on developmental processes in Japanese quail and indicated that similar damage of inner ear sensory epithelium could be developed in chicks hatched and reared in conditions of real weightlessness during the space flight.",

Three strains of Borrelia afzelii were isolated from three different sources: Ixodes ricinus tick (BRZ 9), Culex (Culex) pipiens molestus mosquito (BRZ 14) and Apodemus flavicollis wild rodent (BRZ 21). Vaccination induced formation of IgM and IgG in the BALB/c mice (males) and these antibodies were detected in the serum by the Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA). IgM antibodies were significantly increased in the mice immunized with BRZ 21 in the third sera testing ( P &lt; 0.001) and IgG antibodies in the mice immunized with the BRZ 9 and BRZ 21 strains ( P &lt; 0.01) during the whole three-sample collection. Significant differences were found in antibody concentration by comparison of groups immunized with BRZ 9/BRZ 21 and BRZ 14 ( P &lt; 0.001), probably caused by the amount of antigen of BRZ 14 strain. Such finding implies that the immune system of the host (rodent), attacked by the same genospecies of pathogenic borreliae ( B. afzelii ) coming from different sources reacts with the same intensity. This is the first study of reaction of the same borrelian antigen mixture coming from various sources.",

Body weight of the sows was recorded at mating, farrowing, weaning and slaughter. The assessment covered the degree of sow body weight loss and its influence on carcass and meat quality as related to the lactation period and to the extent of lactation body loss below 5%, from 5 to 10% and over 10% of body weight. Carcass quality as well as physicochemical meat traits were also subjected to evaluation. Extending the nursing period from 21 to 28 days increased the average lactation body weight loss from 7.88 to 8.50% ( P ≤ 0.01). This did not influence the carcass quality in any noticeable way; nonetheless, some meat traits did yield less favourable results. These were related to the electric conductivity of the meat as well as its water holding capacity and colour ( P ≤ 0.01). The same undesirable tendency was observed in the group of sows with body weight losses exceeding 10%. It resulted in the decrease of backfat thickness ( P ≤ 0.01) and reduction of certain meat traits, particularly lower protein content ( P ≤ 0.05). Lower carcass fatness of primiparous sows is a beneficial trait in preparation of a heavy pig for slaughter.",

One of the possible sources of fluorine for humans is spice, containing various amounts of this trace element. This work describes the method for fluoride determination in various kinds ofspices using microwave-supported sample preparation in high pressure oxygen atmosphere followed by potentiometry with a fluoride ion-selective electrode. Parameters of the microwave device for combustion procedure were checked and optimized in order to find settings ensuring complete sample combustion and/or absorption of the analyte in the absorption solution. For the ion-selective electrode measurement, the technique of standard straight line was chosen. Concentrations of fluorides in spices and spice blends under investigation ranged from 3.15 mg·kg -1 to 26.08 mg·kg -1 . In order to check the accuracy of the method Certified Reference Material Fluoride in Vegetation NIST 2695 was used and a good agreement between certified and found values was found. The precision expressed as the relative standard deviation ranged from 0.6% to 5.0%. The method is fast, accurate and reliable for this kind of analysis.

In all three cases penetrating keratoplasty was performed. Each affected eye had an abscess within the corneal stroma. An initial full thickness circular corneal incision was made around the lesion. After excision of the stromal abscess the created defect was replaced with a larger diameter full thickness donor graft and the initial corneal incision was repaired. All of the horses that underwent penetrating keratoplasty procedure healed with a scar at the graft site and remained visual. Penetrating keratoplasty is an effective technique for surgical removal of medically nonresponsive full thickness stromal abscess in horses and results in a visual and cosmetically acceptable globe. The advantages of this technique compared to medical therapy are that there is less scarring, shorter healing times and less damage of the globe because of the concurrent uveitis. To the authors’ knowledge, clinical experience with penetrating keratoplasty in horses has not been reported in Europe so far.",

It is assumed that the patellar ligament is loaded with little force similarly as after tibial plateau levelling osteotomy. Various aspects related to secondary patellar desmopathy are not completely understood. This study deals with computed radiography measurement of patellar ligament thickness after tibial tuberosity advancement in dogs with cranial cruciate ligament rupture. The thickness of the patellar ligament in exactly predetermined locations was measured from mediolateral radiographs of stifle joints. A total of 18 dogs (20 knee joints) with cranial cruciate ligament (ligamentum cruciatum craniale) rupture underwent three radiographic examinations of the knee (preoperative examination and control examination 7 and 15 weeks after the surgery). Significant difference was found between the thickness of the patellar ligament in the first and second examinations. Some of the demographic factors possibly related to patellar ligament thickness (age, sex, body weight, type of cranial cruciate ligament rupture, arthrotomy, cage size, meniscal injury, time between surgery and radiographic examination) were analyzed. However, statistical analyses did not show any effect of these factors on the thickness of the patellar ligament, except for the time between surgery and radiographic examination. These findings can extend the surgeons’ knowledge of biomechanical aspects of tibial tuberosity advancement.",

New Zealand white male rabbits (n = 18) were treated with 1 of 3 regimens: a single periocular injection of 15 mg of carboplatin (group I), a single periocular injection of 30 mg of carboplatin (group II) and a single transcorneal intravitreal injection of 0.05 mg of carboplatin (group III). Ophthalmologic examinations and vitreous samplings were performed under dissociative anaesthesia at regular intervals during next 2 (groups I and III) or 3 (group II) weeks. Carboplatin concentrations in vitreous samples were assessed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. At the end of experiments, all rabbit eyes were obtained for histopathologic examination. Clinical and histological evidence of toxicity was graded into four grades according to anatomical structures of the rabbit eye. The dose limiting toxicity was reached in group II after periocular injection of 30 mg of carboplatin and in group III after intravitreal injection of 0.05 mg of carboplatin. No systemic toxicity was observed in any group. Focal carboplatin administration may decrease systemic exposure to this cytotoxic drug in the retinoblastoma treatment. This moreover suggests that focal carboplatin administration is a promising approach and challenge for advanced retinoblastoma chemotherapy.",

The virus sequences were also compared with known sequences of the abortogenic reference virus strain (V592) and with other known viral strains. One point mutation in a nucleotide sequence coding glycoprotein G was found, distinguishing the field isolate from V592. One point mutation in the gene for glycoprotein C was passage-induced.

Control animals were given luteinizing hormone (12.5 mg and 25 mg) or human chorionic gonadotropin (2000 IU) intravenously. Accessory corpus luteum on day 14 of the oestrous cycle was considered as an evidence of ovulation. Ovulation was observed in 2 out of 3 heifers in each treatment group (n = 3) after administration of 10–0.1 µg luteinizing hormone (except for 0.5 µg – ovulation in 3 of 3 heifers), in all heifers after administration of 10–0.01 IU human chorionic gonadotropin as well as in all control heifers. Administration of 0.01 µg and 0.001 µg luteinizing hormone as well as of 0.001 IU human chorionic gonadotropin did not result in ovulation.

Increased osmotic resistance was significantly associated with hepatic lipogranulomas. Based on these results, dogs with a congenital portosystemic shunt have a significantly increased erythrocyte osmotic resistance suggesting impaired red blood cell deformability.

The mitochondria were enlarged and the spaces between the myofibrils were slightly extended compared to control. The sarcomeres were irregular and lipid droplets occurred in the sarcoplasm. Further developmental changes occurred on day 28 of age. Mitochondria fused into the giant mitochondria which frequently exceeded the length of one sarcomere. Moreover, at 42 days of age, beside the above mentioned changes, sarcoplasmic reticulum was dilated and the number of mitochondrial cristae was reduced. However, the structure of m. gastrocnemius on day 56 was less damaged compared to the damage observed on day 42 of age. Presented results indicate that the continuous stay of male Japanese quail under simulated microgravity has a negative impact on the structure of m. gastrocnemius, but also the ability of muscle tissue to cope with these specific conditions.",

Sus z y c k a: The Influence of Increased Protein Collfellf in the Diet on Renal FUllctions in Call'es. Acta vet. Brno 1996.65: 115-121. The aim of this work was to study the effect of feeding calves in the neonatal period a diet with increased protein content on their renal function. The experiment was c,IITied out in 3 phases on 10 clinically healthy black and white cah·es. The diet fed to calves in phase 2 was enriched with 25'k casein compared to standard diet fed in phases I and 3. Studies on kidney functions in calves were perfomed using clearance methods in phase I. further 7 and 14 days after introducing phase 2. and 7 days after return to standard diet (phase 3). using inulin and PAH (para-aminohippuric sodium salt) as testing subst,mces. Glomerular tiltration rate (GFR) and PAH clearance (ERPF Effective Renal Plasma Flow) were defined on the basis of inulin and PAH elimination rate from blood. Effective renal blood !low (ERBF) and filtration fraction (FF) were also calculated. Additionally the blood plasma electrolyte concentrations (Na. K.CIJ. total protein content and urea concentration were also determined. Increased protein amount in the diet did not affect the total protein and urea concentration in plasma. At the same time. the Nu concentration increased and the K+ concentration decreased. However. there were no significant changes in CI- concentration and in plasma osmolality. Further. an increase of renal blood and plasma tlow. increase of glomerular tiltration rate IGFR) and filtration fraction were observed. These dlanges were statistically significant (P < OJ) I). The results show that intake of a protein-rich diet modifies the renal functions in calves during their early postnatal period. Seven-day long period of feeding the animals a diet with casein supplement caused the renal blood and plasma !low to increase. and FF was higher. too. One may presume that it was the expression of mobilizing the adaptation mechanisms to effectiwly remove protein metabolism products from the organism. Renal hemodynamics changes induced by the protein-rich diet involved tirst of all the glomerular area as a prerequisite forplusma hyperfiltration.",

    "abstract": "Among the different nutrients that can interfere with performance and carcass quality, lysine appears to exert the most pronounced effect, since this additional supplementation improves weight gain, feed conversion and reduces abdominal fat. Specifically about amino acids, the deficiency in the initial phase prevents the maximum proteic deposition while the excess at the end of the phase, beyond it represents waste, it spends additional energy with excretion in the form of uric acid. The solution proposed for this nutritional impasse has been the recommendation of the adoption of a larger number of diets during the life of birds, known as phase-feeding program, where the differences between required and supplied are lower. In formulating the diets for the phase-feeding, researchers have used mathematical models developed from the requirements set by performance experiments or growth curve and deposition of protein in birds. Among the models available, the Gompertz equation is that best describes the growth of chickens and various tissues. The use of mathematical models to describe the growth of birds allows adequate information of weight versus age and minimizes any random effect caused, for example, by the environment. Predict the performance of birds under different feeding conditions and management or even of different strains is information that the use of the Gompertz equation can provide the professionals of the area.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Amino acids, Gompertz equations, phase feeding",

    "abstract": "The Armadillo is a solitary animal. It occupies fields, cerrados and forest edges where excavates tunnels to hide in. Unlike many other species of sloth, this often reuses its toggling, because they have a strong protection of rigid and extremely keratinized carapace connected to the body by a thick and cornea skin. It could be demonstrated in this study that all bone structures and accidents of PNAS are targeted solely to their way of life. The scapula had 18.0 cm longitudinal, 6.0 cm vertical from the caudal angle to the end of the supra spinous fossa and 2.5 cm from the origin of the acromion. The humerus presented a long lateral epicondyle (2.0 cm), the deltoid tuberosity was 1.0 cm, much developed in the kite muscle. The humerus presented 6.0 cm longitudinal. The radio is short, a bone with 4,0 cm longitudinal and 0,5 cm vertical. But the ulna presents a long olecranon, with 2.5 cm longitudinal and 1.0 cm vertical. The carpais, metacarpais and phalanges are very short, not allowing measurements. The femur presents the first, second and third trochanter, being the third well developed. Designed laterally with 2.5 cm lengthwise, it was 19.0 cm long. The patella was 1.8 cm long. The body of the tibia presented 1,0 cm of projection for the sideplane and 14.0 cm² picking area of the body of the fibula. The measurement of the tibia and fibula was 7.0 cm longitudinal, and they are rendered. The seventh or last cervical vertebra with the first thoracic vertebra is a bone floor named transverse process, in which there is a large dorsal foramen forming a triangle with 1.2 cm height (0.96 cm² area). There are ten relatively small thoracic vertebrae with small, thin and inclined neural spines. The holy bone of this animal may be called sinsacro, because its form is similar to birds, presence of long and heavy tail with 26.0 in long and gradual decrease in the size of the vertebrae.\r\n\r\nKeywords: armadillos, carapace, Euphractus sexcinctus",

Two experiments were carried out to determine corrected apparent metabolizable energy (AMEn), through the method of total excreta collection with broiler chickens, and corrected true metabolizable energy (TMEn) and true digestibility of amino acids of (SFM), through the method of forced feeding with cecectomized roosters. The SFM used presented 89.95% of DM, 28.09% of CP, 4,429 kcal/kg of CE, 22.37% of CF, 2.87 of EE, 0.83% of P and 0.30% of Ca. The TMEn and AMEn were 2,200 and 1,983 kcal/kg, respectively. The values of lysine, methionine, and threonine were 0.68, 0.54, and 0.82, respectively. A trial was carried out at to evaluate the performance, carcass yield and cuts, and economic viability of broilers fed with diets containing different levels of inclusion 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20% of SFM. With inclusion of SFM the feed intake reduced linearly in the initial phase and the feed:gain ratio improved linearly in the total period, while there was quadratic effect to feed:gain ratio in the initial phase. No significant differences were found for carcass yield and cuts. And two experiments were carried out in order to evaluate the performance, carcass yield and cuts, and economic viability of broiler chickens fed with diets containing two different levels of SFM (0% and 20%), with or without enzymatic complex supplementation (EC) (Cellulase, β-glucanase, xylanase and phytase) and the values of AMEn of initial diets. No interactions were observed between the SFM and EC on the performance of animals. While the SFM has significantly decreased the feed intake in the initial phase and the total period, weight gain did not differ during these phases. In all stages there was improvement in feed:gain ratio with the use of SFM, probably due to the inclusion levels of oil in the diet, which might have improved digestibility. There was a significant increase in weight gain with the use of EC in the initial phase. There was no significant effect of SFM and EC on carcass yield or cuts. There was no significant effect of adding EC on the values of AMEn of diets, but the addition of EC significantly improved apparent coefficients of metabolizability of phosphorus and calcium.",

Este trabalho foi desenvolvido para avaliar e comparar a qualidade microbiologica deste produto nestes dois tipos de fabricacao. Foram coletadas 20 amostras, aleatoriamente, no municipio de Mossoro – Rio Grande do Norte, sendo 10 marcas artesanais e 10 industrializadas. Para tanto, foram realizadas analises para a determinacao do numero mais provavel (NMP) de coliformes totais e termotolerantes, contagens de microrganismos aerobios mesofilos e pesquisa de Staphylococcus aureus. Duas amostras artesanais apresentaram contagens de S. aureus elevadas, iguais a 4,2x10 e 6x102 UFC/ mL. Esse microrganismo nao foi detectado nas marcas industrializadas. Na contagem de aerobios mesofilos seis amostras (30%) apresentaram-se positivas, sendo entre essas, quatro artesanais (20%), e duas industrializadas (10%). Na determinacao de NMP de coliformes totais 10% das amostras, ambas industrializadas, tiveram resultados acima dos padroes. Ja na determinacao de NMP de coliformes termotolerantes, todas as amostras apresentaram-se dentro dos padroes permitidos pela legislacao.

Apesar do exato mecanismo da degeneracao retiniana induzida pela enrofloxacina nao estar bem esclarecida ainda, sugere-se que existam alguns fatores predisponentes como: altas doses da droga ou altas concentracoes no plasma; infusao intravenosa rapida de enrofloxacina; longos periodos de tratamento; idade; exposicao prolongada a luz solar durante o tratamento; interacoes medicamentosas e acumulo da droga devido ao seu metabolismo alterado ou eliminacao reduzida.

The study was conducted on 12 clinically healthy pregnant goats ( Capra hircus ) - 75% genotype of the Polish noble white aged between 2-3 years. Blood was taken from the external jugular vein early in the morning before feeding and obtained twice (4 weeks and 1 week) before delivery and twice (2 and 3 weeks) after delivery. The ATP concentration did not change significantly. One week before delivery ADP, AMP and Ino concentrations were significantly higher and AEC value significantly lower compared to values in the third week after delivery ( p ≤ 0.02, p ≤ 0.05, p ≤ 0.03 and p ≤ 0.01, respectively). One week before and two weeks after delivery we observed a significant increase in SOD and GR activities and an increase in NAD + and NADP + concentrations but a significant decrease in Hyp and UA concentrations. Constant ATP concentration and the changes in the dynamics and tendency of Hyp and UA concentrations show that in the periparturient period in goats, purine metabolism undergoes adaptive changes. The balance between resynthetic processes and adenine nucleotide degradation is retained in order to level the oxygen and energy lacks. The results of our study show that the maintenance of prooxidative homeostasis in goats of peripartal period depends mainly on enzymatic mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this work was to study the distribution of heavy metals and of subsequently developed morphological changes in the liver of female mice and their foetuses after oral administration of high doses of lead, mercury, and cadmium (0.03 mg of metal per mouse and day). Heavy metals were administered to pregnant female mice on days 9-20 of pregnancy. The animals were euthanised by cervical dislocation. Samples of mother and foetal liver were subsequently collected and processed by means of the common technique for light and electron microscopy. Histochemical reaction based on metal conversion into appropriate sulphide that conjugates with silver was used for detection of heavy metals. Deposits of heavy metals were found at the periphery of lobules of the central vein in the liver of female mice. On the contrary, in the liver of foetuses no predilection site for localisation of the reaction product could be identified. At the electron microscopy level, accumulation of heavy metals was connected as a rule with the occurrence of certain damage to some organelles. Deposits of the reaction product were located mainly in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. Heavy metals were bound to the heterochromatin of cell nuclei, as well as to some cytoplasmic organelles, such as rough endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, ribosomes, and lysosomes. The presence of heavy metals was associated with obliteration of cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, separation of ribosomes, and destruction of lysosomes. Vacuolation of cell cytoplasm was also a frequent phenomenon. An interesting finding was the \"contrasting\" of structures containing nucleic acids. Accumulation of metals in the liver of pregnant mice and their foetuses observed in our study indicated that placental barrier does not protect the foetal organism against penetration of metals. Their higher accumulation in foetal compared to maternal liver can be explained by the intense metabolism of differentiating hepatocytes.",

While comparing high- and low-tannin horse bean varieties, it was observed that in the case of small doses of 1 and 2 g a higher intensity of fermentation takes place in the samples with the addition of high-tannin horse bean. In the case of larger doses of 5 g per sample, a higher intensity of fermentation takes place in the samples with the addition of low-tannin horse-bean.

The objective of this study was to find the best surgical technique of vascular and intestinal anastomosis in different experimental settings (animals with and without immunosuppression) which could have a major impact on everyday veterinary practice. Transplantation was performed in 43 pigs. In the surgical part of the experiment we examined the most suitable surgical technique of vascular anastomosis. A running continuous single-layer seromuscular suture was used for all types of intestinal anastomoses. With regard to vascular anastomosis, the animals were divided into two groups. In group 1 (n = 18) one animal was both donor and recipient of the intestinal graft. Anastomoses were constructed to the mesenteric vessel bed. In group 2 (n = 25), one animal was the graft donor and another was the graft recipient, with revascularization to the central vessel bed. In the second part of the study, we examined the impact of immunosuppressive drug administration on acute cellular rejection and animal survival. Animals that died due to technical failure and reasons unrelated to transplantation were excluded from the evaluation (19 pigs). A total of 24 pigs were included in the second part of the study. The animals were divided into four experimental groups. Group A - autotransplantation (n = 3), group B - allotransplantation on tacrolimus monotherapy (n = 7), group C on combined immunosuppression with tacrolimus and sirolimus (n = 8), and control group D - without immunosuppression (n = 6). Results: A high rate of vascular complications occurred in the first group; 67% (12 out of 18). In the second group, the rate of complications was reduced to 12% (3 out of 25). In the second part of the study the shortest survival was found in group D and the longest in group A. In neither of the immunosuppressed groups (B + C) did we find any significant difference in survival. No complication with the healing of intestinal anastomosis was found in any group. In conclusion we can state the single-layer continuous running suture was safe for all kinds of intestinal anastomoses. Vascular reconstruction to the central vessels was safer for graft survival.",

After RHDV inoculation, it was observed that serum AFP increased significantly ( p = 0.0082) together with significant elevation in serum aspartate amino transferase (AST), alanine amino transferase (ALT), γ-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Rabbits that died tended to have high AFP values prior to death, the mean value being 4.22 ± 1.61 ng/ml (n = 6). By correlation analysis, AFP significantly correlated more strongly to ALP than γ-GT, but non-significantly with AST and ALT. This is the first report of serum AFP elevation being associated with RHDV infection. Thus, measurement of serum AFP might be a useful complementary index for RHDV infectivity and prognosis.",

It was found that with increase in the number of animals in production occurred at the reduced share of operating cost effective - Economic Committee on Revenue. The total costs compared to revenue production for 100-150 animals were 105.74% and 88.26%. The balance of the project was achieved with production of between 110-121 animals. Gross margin, net margin was positive in herds 100-150. It was observed that when the fixed cost is discounted return on capital invested in land, the profit was obtained with the production of 121 animals. The profitability of the project without considering the return on capital invested in land was negative for production of 100 and 110 animals, and positive for the production of 121, 133 and 150 animals.

The goal of this work was to express the recombinant M protein of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in Escherichia coli cells and compare its serological reactivity with the N protein of the virus. The gene coding for the M protein was cloned into the pDest17 vector. The resulting protein was purified by metalochelating affinity chromatography. Recombinant M protein was applied as an antigen in immunoblot test and compared on a panel of porcine sera with N protein based IDEXX test. Of 120 examined samples, the majority (78.3%) gave identical results using both compared tests. From the group of discrepant results, IDEXX test identified considerably more positive sera (17.5%) than M protein based test (4.2%). The main contribution of the work is finding that although IDEXX test proved to be more sensitive than M protein based test, 4.2% of sera would escape detection by serological test based on N protein. Further development and purification of the M protein for the use in Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay format test could increase the performance of serological testing.",

    "abstract": "Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is the most important cytokine in the inflammation cascade activation in all tissues and is present in acute and chronic phases of inflammation. By blocking IL-1 binding to target cells, numerous inflammation processes are prevented. The use of autologous conditioned serum rich with IL-1 receptor antagonist protein (IL-1Ra) is a novel treatment method of tendon inflammation in domestic animals and humans. Injections of autologous conditioned serum (ACS) have demonstrated clinical efficacy and safety in animal models and humans in the treatment of osteoarthritis, disc prolapse and muscles and tendons injuries with low side effect. Neutropaenia, reduced white blood cell count, and infections or local irritations are described as side effects of IL-1 antagonist use in humans. Therefore, a study of blood changes in rabbits after local administration of IL-1Ra in the Achilles tendon tissue after iatrogenic inflammation was conducted. Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein was used to prevent and reduce tendon inflammation after longitudinal tenotomy. The study was done on 26 white Californian rabbits, divided into two equal groups consisting of 13 animals each; the experimental interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein (irap) group, and the control group. In the irap group, autologous serum rich with IL-1Ra was used (Orthokine ® vet irap, Alfa-Arthro, Croatia). Differences between two groups were considered significant as changes in the blood for certain blood elements at P &lt; 0.01. The P value was P = 0.0153 for the white blood cells, P = 0.00153 for neutrophils, P = 0.00017 and for platelets. In the control group, an increased platelet count was noticed in 70% of blood samples and a decreased neutrophil count was found in all of the irap group samples at the end of the study in comparison to the initial blood count prior to application.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different glycerol concentrations on stallion sperm motility after thawing. For statistical analysis 228 ejaculates were used. The semen was filtrated to remove gel fraction; macroscopic and microscopic evaluation was done. After evaluation the ejaculates were centrifuged, the supernatant was removed and the spermatozoa were re-suspended in French diluent with different concentrations of glycerol (2.0; 2.5; 4.0 and 6.0%). The choice of concentration of glycerol for a particular ejaculate was completely random. The spermatozoa were packed into 0.5 ml straws and placed for 2 h in a fridge (4 °C). Then the straws were placed in liquid nitrogen vapor (-80 to -100 °C) and after 10 min plunged into liquid nitrogen and stored at -196 °C for at least 48 h. The selected straws were individually thawed in a 38 °C water bath for 30 s prior to post-freezing analysis. Two progressive motilities using phase contrast microscopy (magnification × 400) were recorded: motility II immediately after thawing and motility III after 2 h incubation in a 38 °C water bath. The Spearmen/Kendall rang correlation test was selected to prove whether there is a correlation between the selected indices (glycerol concentration and motility II and motility III). Nonparametric multiple group analysis (Steel-Dwass test) was applied for finding the differences between groups. The Spearman/Kendall rang correlation proved a relationship between motility II and glycerol concentration. It can be stated that in this study the best glycerol concentration for freezing equine spermatozoa is with a concentration of 4.0% glycerol.",

    "abstract": "In recent research, personality consistency has become an important characteristic. Diverse traits and human-animal interactions, in particular, are studied in the field of personality consistency in dogs. Here, we investigated the consistency of dominant behaviours in cloned and control groups followed by the modified Puppy Aptitude Test, which consists of ten subtests to ascertain the influence of genetic identity. In this test, puppies are exposed to stranger, restraint, prey-like object, noise, startling object, etc. Six cloned and four control puppies participated and the consistency of responses at ages 7–10 and 16 weeks in the two groups was compared. The two groups showed different consistencies in the subtests. While the average scores of the cloned group were consistent ( P = 0.7991), those of the control group were not ( P = 0.0089). Scores of Pack Drive and Fight or Flight Drive were consistent in the cloned group, however, those of the control group were not. Scores of Prey Drive were not consistent in either the cloned or the control group. Therefore, it is suggested that consistency of dominant behaviour is affected by genetic identity and some behaviours can be influenced more than others. Our results suggest that cloned dogs could show more consistent traits than non-cloned. This study implies that personality consistency could be one of the ways to analyse traits of puppies.",

Blood samples were taken at 3, 21, 28, and 35 days of age and examined for haematological and biochemical indices. Iron deficiency in the experimental group resulted in the development of anaemia. Significantly lower ceruloplasmin activities in blood plasma were found in the anaemic piglets. The other biochemical indices of the oxidative status (thiobarbituric acid reacting substances, carbonyl proteins, super oxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity) were comparable between the experimental and the control group. It can be concluded that apart from lower ceruloplasmin activities the oxidative status of piglets was not affected negatively by iron deficiency.",

Diet supplemented with L. plantarum and inulin alleviated DSS induced inflammatory process by inhibiting production of IL-6, IL-8, activities of NFκB and MPO, and by stimulation of IL-13. These results indicate that the dietary intake of Lactobacillus plantarum LS/07 and inulin suppressed the expression of markers playing an important role in the inflammatory process, which predisposes their use in prevention or treatment of acute colitis.",

This study compares two manners of feeding calves – the esophageal tube feeder (n = 97) and the nipple bottle (n = 97), and their effect on the number of all absorbed immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE). It was statistically proven that absorption of immunoglobulins is better with the nipple bottle ( P &lt; 0.0001). The feeding of calves through a nipple bottle is more beneficial because the content of total protein is the higher than by the feeding through an esophageal tube feeder.",

Blood samples were taken before and immediately after the exercise. The environmental conditions during the competitions varied, with a mean temperature of 22.5 °C and a mean relative humidity of 73.20%. The Žemaitukai horses showed lower haematological values and increased muscle catabolism after exercise. Arabian horses have higher aerobic capacity compared to the Žemaitukai horses which probably contributes to their superior low- to moderate-intensity exercise performance. Serum activity of muscle enzymes suggested that the muscle tissue of the Arabian horses has higher tolerance for exercise-induced muscle catabolism and lower muscle catabolism than that of muscle tissue of the Žemaitukai horses. Further studies need to be carried out to identify the diferences in muscle tissue of both breeds.",

    "abstract": "Detection of the circulating tumour cells (CTC) in dogs with a mammary tumour is a useful tool to reveal the micrometastases long before metastases are recognised clinically. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), claudin 7 (CLND7) and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EPCAM) with the clinical indices and to reveal the diagnostic importance of these biomarkers in canine mammary tumours (CMTs). Peripheral blood (PB) samples were collected from 45 bitches (group MT) which had single mass with malignant epithelial tumours and 9 healthy bitches (group H). Real time PCR (rt-PCR) was performed to determine the expression levels of EGFR, CLDN7, and EPCAM. Mean values of EGFR and CLDN7 expressions were significantly higher in group MT compared to group H ( P &lt; 0.01 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively). The expression level of CLDN7 was positively correlated with EGFR and EPCAM ( P &lt; 0.001 and P &lt; 0.05, respectively). The EPCAM expression was associated with increased tumour size ( P &lt; 0.05) and EPCAM tended to decrease in the presence of skin ulceration on tumour ( P = 0.05). Furthermore, expression levels of EGFR in intact dogs were significantly higher compared to spayed dogs in group MT ( P &lt; 0.01). The EGFR expression was significantly higher in the presence of metastases ( P &lt; 0.05). Also, increased EGFR was determined in grade 2 compared to grade 1 ( P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, these results show that EGFR, CLDN7, EPCAM markers are measureable in PB and they may provide valuable information about the clinical pathophysiology of CMT.",

    "abstract": "Angiomyolipoma is an extremely rare neoplasm in animals. It belongs to a group of perivascular epithelioid cell tumours (so-called PEComas). This study reports a case of primary soft tissue angiomyolipoma in a dog with some unusual clinical features. A 4-year old female Labrador dog with a rapidly growing pelvic tumour measuring 30 × 20 cm with a short history of 12 weeks was presented. The tumour was well-circumscribed and pushed into the right vaginal wall and into the perineum. The tumour was completely surgically excised. An extensive histological examination was performed, including immunohistochemical analysis. Histology revealed a mesenchymal neoplasm consisting of three tissue components – mature adipose tissue (which dominated), vessels, and smooth muscle (spindle) cells. The lesion showed positive immunohistochemical staining with smooth muscle actin and desmin in mature-appearing smooth muscle cells and S-100 protein positivity in adipocytes. The diagnosis of angiomyolipoma must be considered in different types of benign and malignant tumours of various lineages. The diagnostic approach to soft tissue tumours, including angiomyolipoma, requires optimal processing and sectioning of resected specimens. This paper is believed to be the first case of primary soft tissue angiomyolipoma reported in the veterinary literature.",

The aim of this study was to focus on the occurrence of Mycoplasma haemofelis , Mycoplasma haemominutum , and Mycoplasma turicensis in cats. We followed infected individuals’ breeding conditions, age, sex, basic haematological indices, and co-infection with one of the feline retroviruses. A total of 73 cats were investigated. Haemoplasmas were detected by PCR and verified by sequencing. Haematology examination was performed focusing on the number of erythrocytes, haemoglobin concentrations and haematocrit. A subset of 40 cat blood samples was examined by a rapid immunochromatography test to detect retroviruses. The following was found in our study group: M. haemofelis in 12.3% of individuals, M. haemominutum in 35.6% of individuals and M. turicensis in 17.8% of individuals. A highly significant difference was found between positive evidence of blood mycoplasmas in cats living only at home (15%) and in cats with access to the outside (69.8%). There was also a highly significant difference in the incidence of mycoplasma in cats over 3 years of age compared to 1–3 years of age and up to 1 year of age. There was no difference in the frequency of infections between the sexes. Blood mycoplasma infection in our group was not accompanied by fundamental changes in the haematological indices and was only reflected by a decrease in haemoglobin values in three cases. In a subset of cats that were also examined for the presence of retroviral infection, mycoplasma infection in blood was confirmed in all five positive cases.",

The presence of H. pylori in the gastrointestinal tract is associated with the occurrence of serious human diseases such as chronic gastritis, duodenal ulcer or gastric cancer. Therefore, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified H. pylori as a Group 1 carcinogen in 1994. The routes of H. pylori transmission are not yet precisely known. Many authors agree that humans may become infected by H. pylori through foodstuffs. Milk is one of the basic foods of people of all age categories. Helicobacter pylori has been isolated from milk derived from various livestock, such as cows, sheep, goat, camel or buffalo milk. This review research paper indicates that H. pylori may be present in different types of foods and suggests that consumption of milk and selected dairy products may be a source of H. pylori infection for humans.",

    "abstract": "The assessment of mercury content in the muscle, liver and kidneys of fattening pigs and sows was conducted in the Czech Republic during the period of 2015–2019. The samples were collected from sows (n = 31) and fattening pigs (n = 210). The average mercury content in muscle, liver, and kidneys of sows over 5 years was 0.00057 ± 0.00004, 0.0045 ± 0.0008, and 0.0224 ± 0.0067 mg·kg -1 , respectively. The average mercury content in muscle, liver, and kidneys of fattening pigs over the same period was 0.00059 ± 0.00004, 0.0012 ± 0.0001, and 0.0044 ± 0.0004 mg·kg -1 , respectively. The maximum residual limit (MRL) for human consumption was exceeded in 14 kidney samples. The mercury content in liver did not differ significantly between sows and fattening pigs; in kidneys, the mercury content was higher in sows, with a significant difference in one year ( P &lt; 0.05). A slight decrease in the mercury content in kidneys and liver was observed in fattening pigs from the year 2015. In sows, there was a significant increase in the mercury content in kidneys in the year 2016. It can be concluded that there is a need for further monitoring of the mercury content in pig tissues in the Czech Republic.",

    "abstract": "The pharmacokinetic characteristics of toltrazuril (TZR) and its metabolites toltrazuril sulphoxide (TZR.SO) and toltrazuril sulphone (TZR.SO 2 ) were assessed in non-pregnant and pregnant goats. Ten healthy Baladi female goats were allocated into two groups (n = 5 per group): non-pregnant goats (group 1) and pregnant goats at 2–3 months of gestation (group 2). Toltrazuril was administered once orally to all goats at 20 mg/kg. Plasma samples were collected at 0 (before TZR administration), 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48, 72 h and 5, 7, 9, 12, 16, 20, 24, 27, 30, and 35 days post therapy to measure the concentrations of TZR and its metabolites. In pregnant goats, the maximum plasma concentration (C max ), time to reach C max (T max ), and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the last sample (AUC 0-last ) of TZR were significantly higher ( P &lt; 0.05) compared to the non-pregnant ones, whereas the volume of distribution (Vz_F_obs) and clearance (Cl_F_obs) were significantly lower ( P &lt; 0.05) in pregnant goats. No significant differences were observed in the elimination half-life (T 1/2λz ), and mean residence time (MRT) between the two groups. In non-pregnant goats, TZR.SO and TZR.SO 2 could be detected in plasma until 12 and 30 days, respectively; whereas in pregnant goats, they were quantified up to 16 and 35 days, respectively. Conclusively, TZR was well absorbed and rapidly metabolized to TZR.SO and TZR.SO 2 , after oral dosing in goats. Pregnancy caused significant alterations in some of the pharmacokinetic indicators of TZR and its metabolites in goats.",

The work was proceeded form 2005 to 2006. The main objectives were to evaluate the epidemiological conditions of the apiaries based on the productive and social-economic features. In this way, it was emphasized the comparison between the tax of infestation by Varroa spp. in apiaries with and without superposition of visualized feeding areas based in their geoprocessing analysis. The infestation tax in the two nuclei studied with superposition were 10.95% and 9.29%, respectively; in the nuclei without superposition the analysis showed 3.32% of infestation, that means three times less than the superpositioned ones. Concerning to the productive features, the average media in the region was 20.71 Kg of honey/hive/year. It was concluded, from the data from this study, that the developed apiculture in the studied region can be defined as a subsistence one.",

    "abstract": "The present study was carried out in the city of Ceara-Mirim in agreste of Rio Grande do Norte state, in a beef farm producing precocious steers. Thirteen steers of two different breeding Angus x Nelore (¾ Angus x 1/4 Nelore and ½ Angus x Nelore) were studied for productive performance, corporal measures and adaptability characteristics. The variables studied for herd performance were the mean weight daily gain (GPMD) and live weight being the animals were weighted in loco. For the evaluation of corporal measures were observed the length, anterior height, posterior height and thoracic perimeter with use of adapted ruler and metric ribbon. Rectal temperature, coat thickness, length and number of coats for unit of area had been evaluated to compose the adaptation analysis, beyond meteorological variables as temperature of dry bulb, humid bulb, relative humidity of air and black globe located to the sun and to the shade. The rectal temperature and the meteorological variables had been observed in two schedules, 10:00 h and 15:00 h. The period of collection for herd performance, corporal measures, rectal temperature and meteorological variables was from August of 2006 to September of 2007, totalizing 13 evaluations, while that for coat collection it was from January to March and July of 2007. The group ¾ Angus x ¼ Nelore presented greater live weight to weaning (181,60 kg) and to the end of the experiment (419,80 kg), when compared with ½ Nelore Angus, that showed weaning weight of 158,57 kg and to the end of the experiment of 390,0 kg (P<0,01). It suits to emphasize that the initial weight was the same for two groups (103,03 Kg). The crossbreed with higher proportion of Angus breed also had superiors body measures being statistically significant. This means that the lively weight of the animal was accompanied by his growth, when bigger animals were the heaviest. There was correlation between these variables and the lively weight, being highly significant (P <0,01). For rectal temperature, the crossbreed with higher proportion of Nelore (1/2) breed, showed higher value (40,4o C), perhaps for inherent characteristics of the zebu breed, which have bigger stock of corporal heat and lesser loss of water. The value for the group ¾ Angus x ¼ Nelore was 39,96o C (P <0.01). However, in what it refers to the schedule of data collection, the rectal temperatures had not significant differences, what can suggest a good capacity of losing heat by the animals. For the coat characteristics, there was no difference between the groups in the thickness of the coat and number of hairs, whereas the hairs of the animals of the group ¾ Angus x ¼ Nelore were longer. A bigger length for this group was already waited, since the Taurus presents finer and longer hairs than the zebu breed, this is a adaptive characteristic due to the climate of its country of origin. The thermal comfort was considered within the normality range, being the mean value of the CTR of 516,6 w/m2 and ITGU of 78,3. The genetic group ¾ Angus x ¼ Nelore presented better productive performance and satisfactory adaptive capacity.",

Ten bulls with no specific breed were used, with medium age of 20 months, and average weight of 200 kg. The animals were submitted to an alimentary and hydric fast of 12 hours, previous tranquilization with intramuscular xilazine cloridato (0,05 mg/kg) and local subcutaneous infiltrative anesthesia, using lidocayne cloridato at 2% with vasoconstrictor (9mg/ kg).

The skin was incised in the medium line perineal flow, to locate the flexure sigmoid of the penis, myectomy of retractor muscle and fixation of the curvature flow from the sigmoid flexure of the penis. The results show that the gland has kept distant of the ostio prepucial inhibiting the exhibition of the penises, the myectomy of the retractor muscle decreased the tension applied during the erection and its scarification enabled a better adherence of the extremities. The myectomy of the retractor muscle of the penis hindered their action during the act of the erection, diminishing the discomfort of the animal in the act of the sum, this way, increasing the useful life of these animals in the field. When the animals were tested as ruffians they maintained the libido during the experimental period with total inability penis exhibition.

Semen from eight dogs was collected by digital manipulation. The sperm fraction was evaluated for volume, color, motility, vigor, sperm morphology, acrossomal integrity, osmotic answer and sperm concentration. Then, it was diluted in skimmed UHT milk plus egg yolk (20%) and divided in samples, which were stored in 3L or 5L expanded polystyrene isothermal boxes, containing recyclable ice. These boxes were open after 12h, 18h, 24h and 30h of storage and semen was reevaluated for the characteristics already mentioned. The temperature into the boxes and the environmental temperature were monitored. As main results, the progressive sperm motility was acceptably conserved up to 30h in both boxes, which did not present differences in the conservation of none of the seminal characteristics (P>0.05). However, the temperature into the 3L-box showed a significant elevation starting from the 18h (P<0.05), and the temperature into the 5L-box remained constant for whole the experiment. It is concluded that the canine semen diluted in skimmed UHT milk can be efficiently conserved for up to 30h in 3L or 5L isothermal boxes, containing recyclable ice. But it is pointed out that the 5L-box presents larger safety for the sperm viability, because it is more efficient in the maintenance of a constant temperature.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Semen, dog, cooling.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to compare the efficiency of high and low Ca intake in cows with analytically defined levels of calcaemia, phosphoraemia and magnesaemia in the prepartal period, on their postpartal changes important for the diagnosis of postpartal diseases. In dairy cows (Czech Pied cattle) receiving a winter feed ration, the prepartal intake of Ca was adjusted from day 241 of pregnancy to 80% in group A (n = 15) and to 160% of the standard in group B (n = 9). In both groups the concentrations of Ca, P and Mg in blood serum were measured at the beginning of experimental diets, on day 12 before the expected parturition, and on days 1, 2, 3 and 4 after parturition. At the beginning of the experiment (42 days before parturition) the value of calcaemia was 1.82 ± 0.10 mmol l -1 , phosphoraemia 1.61 ± 0.37 mmol l -1 and magnesaemia 0.74 ± 0.6 mmol l -1 of blood serum. After the 30-day feeding of experimental diet (day 12 before the expected parturition) higher hypocalcaemia was recorded in group A persisting to day 3 post partum. Phosphoraemia and magnesaemia were at the lower limit of reference values only from day 12 before the expected parturition to day 4 post partum. In group A three cows became recumbent until day 3 post partum with a decrease in magnesaemia below 0.5 mmol l -1 . Phosphoraemia and magnesaemia were at the lower limit of reference values only from day 12 before the expected parturition to day 4 post partum. In group A three cows became downed until day 3 post partum with a decrease in magnesaemia below 0.5 mmol l -1 . In group B with 160% intake of Ca, 12 days before the expected parturition calcaemia amounted to 2.20 ± 0.27 mmol l -1 and hypocalcaemia ranging from 1.60 ± 0.45 to 1.80 ± 0.26 mmol l -1 of blood serum persisted from day 1 to day 4 post partum. The average level of phosphoraemia in group B was maintained above 1.80 mmol l -1 and magnesaemia was within the range of 0.93 - 1.21 mmol l -1 of blood serum. The results of the nutrition experiment document that for the prepartal adjustment of Ca intake aimed at a reduction in the incidence of the postpartal downer cow syndrome, it is necessary to determine calcaemia, phosphoraemia and magnesaemia in late-pregnant cows. In hypocalcaemia, hypophosphoraemia and especially hypomagnesaemia the prepartal diet with 80% coverage of Ca need leads to a higher risk of the downer cow syndrome accompanied by higher hypomagnesaemia.",

Group 2: sows (n = 405) received subcutaneously 4 ml of saline injection one day after weaning. Group 3: sows (n = 425), purposely chosen from among animals that did not show heat within 7 days after weaning, were treated on day 7 post-weaning with PMSG and HCG as the animals in group 1. Group 4: sows (n = 415) purposely chosen from among animals that did not show heat within 7 days after weaning, were treated on day 7 post-weaning as group 2. Sows expressing oestrus, sows ovulating after treatment, treatment to oestrus intervals and follicular sizes were evaluated. The number of sows expressing oestrus, sows ovulating, and treatment to oestrus intervals differed between the groups (group 1 vs. 2: P &lt; 0.05, group 3 vs. 4: P &lt; 0.01). The sows treated with PMSG and HCG on day 7 post-weaning (group 3) had smaller ( P &lt; 0.05) follicular diameters compared to the sows that were treated one day after weaning. Group 4 sows had a smaller follicular diameter (3.6 +/- 0.6 mm) compared to group 1 ( P &lt; 0.001) and 3 ( P &lt; 0.01). The present results show that the gonadotropin treatment one day after weaning or in the case of anoestrus 7 days after weaning overrides the negative effects of the hot summer season and effectively prevents seasonal infertility of the breeding sow.",

    "abstract": "Langerhans cells belong to the skin-associated lymphatic tissue (SALT). They are antigenpresenting cells derived from monocyte precursors in the bone marrow. The distribution of Langerhans cells was investigated in feline foetuses on day 40 of ontogenesis, in 9 selected body regions: regio intermandibularis, regio axilaris, regio prepubica, regio inguinalis, regio parietalis, regio interdigitalis, regio thoracis, regio sacralis and regio caudalis. Mouse monoclonal antibody against CD1 receptor (epitope CD1a) was applied to localize Langerhans cells in the skin samples. The highest number of Langerhans cells was found in biopsy of the dorsal part of the feline foetuses. Langerhans cells were present particularly among keratinocytes of stratum germinativum (stratum basale and stratum spinosum), scattered or clustered among epidermal cells closing the hair canal in the region close to the hair follicle. Langerhans cells were further located among cells of outer root sheath in the region of hair follicle infundibulum close to ostium of sebaceous glands ductus, some were found also in the upper part of the hair follicle isthmus. Langerhans cells seem to participate in skin disorders related to hypersensitivity and even tumour transformations. Distribution of these cells may play a role in disease predispositions; knowledge of the physiology and pathophysiology of Langerhans cells opens possible targeted treatments in veterinary medicine.",

    "abstract": "IgG-antibody response in aborting sheep and in apparently healthy sheep in a flock against acidglycine- extracted antigens from three strains for each C. fetus subsp. fetus and C. jejuni were analysed by Western blot. One strain of C. fetus subsp. fetus was isolated from aborting sheep. Western blot analysis of the sera revealed the presence of IgG antibody binding to the common antigens including proteins with the Mw of 63 kDa and 54 kDa in extracts from both C. fetus subsp. fetus and C. jejuni strains. In addition, IgG antibodies in sera from aborting sheep reacted more strongly with the antigens from C. fetus subsp. fetus strains with Mw of approximately 100, 95 and 86.5 kDa than those of apparently healthy sheep. The binding profile of the antibodies with these antigens appeared to be unique for each C. fetus subsp. fetus strain. On the other hand, IgG antibodies only in sera from aborting sheep recognized strongly the antigens of each C. fetus subsp. fetus strain at the Mw ranged from approximately 26 to 22 kDa. However, the antigenic components between 26 and 22 kDa were not detectable in coomassie blue stained gel and thought to have non-protein nature. These low molecular weight antigens of C. fetus subsp. fetus may be related to a recent infection in aborting sheep. These observations indicate that such speciesspecific antigens or conjugated protein antigens could be used for improving the specificity of the serological tests to detect C. fetus antibodies in sheep sera, and may be the candidates for subunit vaccines against ovine abortion.",

The condition was caused by iodine deficiency either in the diet solely or in combination with a partial peroxidase defect. Goitre developed in the puppies, fed giblets and poultry meat. Laboratory examinations in both puppies showed symptoms of hypothyroidism: non-regenerative anaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, significant decrease in the concentration of total thyroxine and increased concentration of thyrotropin. Ultrasonographic examination demonstrated enlarged thyroid glands. Cytological examination confirmed hyperplastic epithelial cells of the thyroid gland. The clinical condition improved within two months after the diet was changed to commercial dog food and after oral iodine supplementation was started. The iodine substitution was gradually discontinued. Four years later, the clinical and laboratory examinations were carried out in one of the presented patients under completely different circumstances (examination after a car accident). Haematological, biochemical and hormonal examinations were entirely within the reference range.",

We found that the affected dogs had increased relative counts of neutrophils, decreased relative and absolute counts of lymphocytes, higher relative counts of CD3+ lymphocytes and CD8+ lymphocytes but lower relative counts of CD21+ lymphocytes and CD4+ lymphocytes. The affected dogs exhibited a reduced activity of nonstimulated as well as mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes. Lower values of circulating immune complexes (CIC) in affected dogs were conditioned by the young age of animals. Nevertheless, the changes found in our study were not expressed in all animals.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the experiment was to investigate the influence of the pheasant vaccination with a vaccine containing live attenuated virus of haemorrhagic enteritis, (HE) on the ability of peripheral blood lymphocytes to form a nuclei deformation described as the radial segmentation (RS). This feature is identified with cytoskeletal rearrangement of the cells. The pheasants were vaccinated against Newcastle disease (ND) on the 1st, 28th and 56th day of life. Moreover, on the 49th day of life, a part of the birds was given the vaccine containing HEV (Haemorrhagic enteritis virus) in drinking water. Fourteen days after the HEV vaccination, the birds were administered intravenously 0.5 ml of the 10% SRBC (Sheep red blood cells) suspension. Blood samples were collected on the 21st day after HEV vaccination, on the 7th day after SRBC injection. It was shown that in pheasants the percentage of cells undergoing RS induced by oxalates was low, approximately 3.75%, whereas in HEV vaccinated birds this percentage increased twice ( p &lt; 0.05). Pheasant immunization with SRBC led to significant reduction of the ability to form RS, whereas in HEV vaccinated birds after SRBC administration the percentage of cells with RS remained on the level of the control group. Based on these results, the authors suggest that immunosuppressive effects of some viruses may be a result of both sensitivity and rearrangement ability changes in cytoskeletal proteins of the cells involved in immunological response.",

The research was conducted on adult ovariectomized (Ovx) rats (Sprague Dawley). Ovx rats were injected for 15 days with 0.2 ml of sesame oil (control; C), or 17β-oestradiol (10 μg/d; E), or progesterone (2 mg/d; P), or E + P. Proliferative activity in the colon was assessed by using proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) antibody. The proliferation index (PI), the number of PCNA positive cells divided by the total number of cells counted in the crypt column multiplied by 100, was calculated. PI was lower in the hormonetreated groups, especially in group P compared to that in group C. The apoptotic index (AI), the mean number of apoptotic cells, was detected by active caspase 3 immunoreactivity per crypt in the colon. AI was lower in the colon crypt epithelium of group E than that of the other groups. However, AI in the colon crypt epithelium in groups P and E + P was higher than that of both group E and group C. In addition, the colon crypt size (the number of epithelial cells lining one side of 10 well-oriented, longitudinally cut crypts) was considerably lower in group E than that of the other groups. In conclusion, we showed that the decrease of AI in group E was balanced by progesterone; the decrease of PI in group P was also depressed by oestrogen.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess the effect of vitamin E and selenium (Se) supplementation on the plasma levels of F 2 -isoprostanes as a marker of oxidative stress in horses in their training period. Twelve healthy 3-year-old English thoroughbred horses were divided into two groups: control (n = 6) and experimental (n = 6). Feeding rations were adapted to a moderate workload. The horses of the experimental group received supplements of DL-α-tocopheryl acetate E (2 250 mg/day/horse) and of sodium selenite (0.5 mg/day/horse). The plasma concentrations of both antioxidants and F 2 -isoprostanes were monitored on days 0, 44 and 70. After 70 days of supplementation, the concentrations of selenium in the experimental group were significantly higher ( P &lt; 0.05) compared to the beginning of the experiment (mean ± SE: 135.81 ± 10.19 μg l -1 vs. 98.70 ± 10.88 μg l -1 ), as well as to the control group (day 0: 101.78 ± 11.06 μg l -1 , day 70: 108.18 ± 7.77 μg l -1 ). In the horses of the experimental group, plasma α-tocopherol levels significantly increased from the 44th day of supplementation compared to the beginning of the study as well to the control group (5.23 ± 0.52 mg l -1 vs. 2.45 ± 0.25 mg l -1 or 3.46 ± 0.34 mg l -1 , respectively). The plasma concentration of F 2 -isoprostanes tended to be lower in the experimental group at the end than at the beginning of monitoring (156.8 ± 12.89 pg l -1 vs. 170.3 ± 60.8 pg l -1 ), although the control group showed the opposite trend (181.2 ± 15.67 pg l -1 vs. 137.0 ± 47.05 pg l -1 ). Nevertheless, none of these differences were significant because of the large variability of the individual values. It can be stated that supplementation of the diet used with selenium and vitamin E caused a non-significant decrease of F 2 -isoprostane concentration in the blood plasma only, and a significant increase of plasma concentrations of these antioxidants. The variation of isoprostane levels probably reflected rather the individual responses of the horses' organisms to the training workload.",

    "abstract": "We analyzed turkey breast meat composition in dependence on the presence of proteins of meat and bone meal origin in the feed mixes used. Farmers involved in the research with comparable zoohygienic and technological conditions of poultry management were divided into two groups. The principal difference between the groups was in the feed mixes they used. Poultry in Group 1 was fed feed mixes containing a total of 7.2 - 9.5% of meat and bone meal, fish meal and poultry meal and of 3.4 - 36.8% of soybean according to the age category as the main source of protein. In Group 2 the nutritious portion of meat and bone meal-based protein was substituted with soybean meal. Feed mixes fed to turkeys in Group 2 contained 9.35 - 35.25% soybean meal depending on the age group. Between 2002 and 2003, turkey meat samples were collected at a turkey slaughterhouse. The samples were cooled to + 4 °C and examined for meat binding characteristics, water content, and total fat. The remaining parts of samples were frozen and pooled. Then they were tested for their content of total protein, net muscle protein, collagen and 9 fatty acids (myristic, palmitic, stearic, palmitoleic, oleic, eicosanic, erucic, linoleic and linolenic). Evaluation of the results showed that the absence of meat and bone meal in feed mixes had no effect on the indicators important for technological properties of male turkey breast muscle (meat binding characteristics, water content, content of total protein, net muscle protein and collagen). The results of the study, however, also demonstrated a decrease in total lipids ( p &lt; 0.05) and a change in the composition of fatty acids when meat and bone meal was replaced with soybean meal (Group 2). Also increased were the levels of palmitic, stearic and eicosanic fatty acids. The difference between eicosanic fatty acid levels was significant ( p &lt; 0.05). In the same group of birds, the level of oleic acid also decreased ( p &lt; 0.01). The change in total lipids and in the composition of fatty acids of male turkey breast muscle might be important with regards to human health (particularly cardiovascular and cancer diseases).",

On ophthalmic examination, pigmented skin with long hairs located ventro-temporally on both corneas, a cluster of aberrant long hairs protruding from both caruncles and medial canthi, and a duplicated inferior eyelid of the left eye were identified. Surgical excision of limbic dermoids on both eyes and blepharoplasty appeared curative at the 6-month post-operative follow-up. This case report describes unusually located bilateral limbic dermoids in a horse. In addition, the dermoid on the left eye was accompanied by eyelid malformation. This unique combination of ocular congenital lesions has not been described in a horse so far.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the effects of nonselective cyclooxygenase (COX)-1/COX-2 inhibitors (acetylsalicylic acid, indomethacin, ibuprofen, flunixin meglumine, phenylbutazone), preferential COX-2 inhibitors (diclofenac, meloxicam, carprofen), selective COX-1 inhibitor (SC-560), and selective COX-2 inhibitors (celecoxib, firocoxib, parecoxib) on the contractions of isolated bronchi induced by electrical field stimulation (EFS). Bronchial rings, obtained from lungs of slaughtered horses, were put in isolated organ baths, and the mechanical activity was measured by means of isotonic transducers. Electrical Field Stimulation was applied to the preparations, and the effects of drugs on the amplitude of evoked contractions were measured. Nonselective COX inhibitors did not modify EFS-induced contractions to a relevant degree, except indomethacin which caused a concentration-dependent decrease of the contraction amplitude. Conversely, preferential COX-2 inhibitors enhanced the contractions in a concentration-related fashion, whilst the selective COX-1 inhibitor reduced them. Among selective COX-2 inhibitors, parecoxib increased EFS-evoked contractions whereas celecoxib and firocoxib were ineffective. These results suggest that the inhibition of prostanoid synthesis does not modify the electrical field-stimulated contractions of isolated horse bronchi. Since EFS-induced contractions of horse bronchi were previously shown to be of full cholinergic nature, the increase caused by diclofenac, meloxicam, carprofen, and parecoxib could be due to an inhibition of acetylcholinesterase; in accordance, these drugs potentiated exogenous acetylcholine-induced but not carbachol-induced bronchial contraction. Indomethacin and SC-560 might instead decrease bronchial contractions by inhibiting calcium currents. Clinical use of meloxicam and carprofen in horses with bronchial hyper-responsiveness requires caution for a potential risk of causing adverse effects due to bronchoconstriction.",

This pathogen causes disease in rainbow trout, sea bass, and sea bream in Turkey, however, it has not been reported from meagre ( Argyrosomus regius ) before. Great loss of meagre was observed in the Recirculated Aquaculture System at the Faculty of Fisheries of Izmir Katip Celebi University, which had been transferred from a commercial hatchery for a nutrition experiment. Clinical signs of vibriosis were observed in infected fish, i.e. haemorrhage in the anal area and pectoral fins, mostly as tail ulcers. Petechial haemorrhages in the muscle, liver, peritoneal membranes and pyloric caeca were determined by necropsy. A Gram-negative, rod-shaped, motile bacterium was isolated, showing a positive reaction to oxidase, catalase and gelatin tests, and being sensitive to O/129. Biochemical identification tests and PCR amplifications identified the bacterium as Listonella anguillarum . In slide agglutination test with anti L. anguillarum O1 (ATCC43305) serum, all isolates were positive. The isolated bacteria was resistant to oxytetracycline, sensitive to enrofloxacin, flumequine, phosphomycin, furozulidone, kanamycin and oxolinic acid. In this study, the isolated bacteria from meagre were determined as Listonella anguillarum O1 with biochemical, moleculer identification and agglutination tests.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this work was to detect the presence of three main pig respiratory viral agents (porcine rubulavirus [PorPV], porcine circovirus type 2 [PCV-2], and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus [PRRSV]) in tissues of emaciated piglets from the Baj'o Region (Mexico). Necropsies and histopathological studies of 37 pigs with poor body condition were performed; viruses were detected by molecular biology methods and PCV-2 was further assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Histopathologically, interstitial pneumonia was observed in 25/37 (68%) of the piglets. Also, a varying degree of lymphocyte depletion in lymphoid organs was found in 14/37 (38%) animals. Through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), from the 37 pigs, 16 were positive for PCV-2, 18 for PRRSV and 1 for PorPV. In accordance with these results, the infection and/or co-infection with PCV-2 and PRRSV were fairly frequent findings in piglets with poor body condition in Mexico, while the infection by PorPV was apparently negligible. Wasting of post-weaning piglets is a global pig farming problem that causes great economic losses and has been associated with diverse factors: microbial agents, environmental factors, nutritional factors, and management. When the Blue Eye Disease was first reported in Mexico, it was associated with severe wasting in post-weaning piglets. This study demonstrated that this disease does not seem to play such an important role in the wasting as was previously thought.",

    "abstract": "Due to the high occurrence of mammary neoplasms in cats, the search for prognostic factors has recently intensified. Human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (Her-2) is prominent among the immunohistochemical markers used for prognosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of Her-2 in mammary lesions in queens and relate the expression to the type and histological grade of mammary carcinomas. Thirty-eight cases were selected from 2006 to 2016 and were classified and histologically graded. Her-2 expression was determined through immunohistochemistry, using a semi-quantitative analysis of the slides according to the scores recommended in the Dako HercepTest. Chi-square test was used to evaluate the relationship between Her-2 expression and mammary lesion type and the type and histological grade of carcinoma ( P &lt; 0.05). The mean age was 8.5 years and young cats were affected only by benign hyperplasias and neoplasms. Undefined cats were more affected (84.37%), followed by Siamese (9.37%) and Persian (6.25%) cats. Regarding the histological classification, 18.42% of the mammary lesions were classified as hyperplasia, 18.42% as adenoma, and 63.16% as carcinoma. The most common type of carcinoma was tubulopapillary carcinoma (66.7%), followed by solid carcinoma (25%) and cribriform carcinoma (8.33%). Her-2 overexpression was observed in four samples (16.7%) of tubulopapillary carcinoma, two grade I carcinomas and two grade II carcinomas, but no relationship was observed between Her-2 expression and type of mammary lesion ( P = 0.3127), carcinoma type (0.3446), or histological grade (0.6485). In conclusion, Her-2 overexpression is unrelated to histological grade and type.",

    "abstract": "Temporomandibular ankylosis, even though considered to be of a relatively rare emergence, can be encountered in day-to-day clinical practice. Most cases follow a typical, if not identical anamnesis pattern. The background of mechanical difficulties manifestation is associated with some trauma. The animals usually suffer a severe blow to the head, leading to a gradual development of the defect, which unfortunately most owners are not aware of, or claim not to be. This case report describes a typical incidence of post traumatic ankylosis of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). The patient suffered a blow to the head at the age of 4 months, the clinical aftermath of which was a gradual difficulty in opening the mouth. A CT examination revealed the extent of damage in the region of the zygomatic arch, affecting also the corresponding TMJ. For this particular case, a surgical intervention was the only course of treatment, meaning the resection of arcus zygomaticus and the TMJ. The procedure was scheduled to be performed 14 days post the CT examination. Due to the fact that the changes were located only on the lateral surface of the TMJ, the plan was to resect and remove the affected area only, with the medial part of the TMJ left intact and in position. The joint capsule was then sutured. This approach proved to be very beneficial and effective in the outcome of the surgery and in aiding in the overall comfort of the patient.",

Evaluation of daily milk yield in relation to milk urea presented a positive regression dependency, which was the strongest in early lactation (r = 0.860; P &lt; 0.001), decreasing in mid lactation (r = 0.329; P &lt; 0.001) and late lactation (r = 0.261; P &lt; 0.001). Evaluation of milk protein in relation to milk urea showed a negative regression dependency, which was the strongest in early lactation (r = -0.850; P &lt; 0.001), decreasing in mid lactation (r = -0.819; P &lt; 0.001) and late lactation (r = -0.679; P &lt; 0.001).

The results of the study confirm the influence of production factors (milk quantity and milk components) on the milk urea content.

    "abstract": "This research aimed to evaluate the effect of thyroid hormone deficiency on the erythrocytic system in dogs. Dogs with clinical symptoms of hypothyreosis such as obesity, hyperpigmentation, and lethargy were selected. The dogs demonstrating breed predisposition to hypothyreosis were incorporated in the analysis: Dachshunds, Retrievers, and mixed-breed dogs. A detailed history was taken and clinical, hormonal, biochemical and haematological blood tests were performed. Peripheral blood samples were taken from 53 dogs. Finally, the dogs with the initial T4 (thyroxine) concentration &lt; 1.3 µg/dl and animals demonstrating clinical improvement after a 2-month therapy with levothyroxine at a dose of 10 µg/kg administered per os two times a day were qualified. The animals between 10 months to 13 years of age were divided into two groups: clinically healthy (control group, n = 35) and dogs presenting clinical symptoms of hypothyreosis (experimental group, n = 18). In this research, the broadly described normocytic normochromic non-regenerative anaemia was not diagnosed in dogs with hypothyreosis. However, a positive correlation between T4 and red blood cell indices such as the average mass of haemoglobin per red blood cell, concentration of haemoglobin in a given volume of packed red blood cells as well as a negative correlation with haematocrit value was discovered in the experimental group after the 2-month therapy with levothyroxine. These results point to the influence of thyroid hormones on erythropoiesis. This observation is partially consistent with other studies, which noted the casual link between the changes in red blood cell system and the function of thyroid in dogs and humans.",

    "abstract": "The most frequent canine perineal tumour is the perianal (gland) adenoma (also known as the circumanal adenoma or the hepatoid adenoma). Tumour markers are substances that are produced by the body in response to cancer, or may be produced by cancer itself. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and tissue polypeptide specific antigen (TPSA) are tumour antigens that are markers of carcinogenesis, with significantly elevated serum concentrations in the case of some types of tumours. In our study it has been proven that dogs with a perineal tumour (n = 35) had a mean value of CEA 0.69 ng·ml -1 compared to control dogs (n = 150) with 0.67 ng·ml -1 ( P &gt; 0.05). In TPSA dogs with perineal tumour, the mean value of TPSA was 15.86 IU·l -1 vs 13.92 IU·l -1 in the control dogs ( P &lt; 0.05). The results of the present study show that there is significant differences in TPSA between control dogs and group of dogs with a perineal tumour. Analysis of oncomarkers is a valuable tool for practitioners within small animal oncology, having an advantage over tissue biomarkers as the measurement procedure is non-invasive and shows dynamic changes of physiological and pathological states before clinical signs appear. Therefore, it may be used for an early detection of cancer.",

The highest prevalence is found in large and giant breeds of dogs; the most frequently affected dogs are Doberman Pinschers. Other breeds such as the Great Dane, Boxer, Irish Wolfhound or Cocker Spaniel also have a high prevalence of DCM. No study has yet been reported in regard to the prevalence of DCM in the Weimaraner and its genetic causes. In the study, a total of 232 Weimaraner dogs were enrolled. Out of this total number, 223 dogs were short-haired Weimaraners and 9 dogs were long-haired Weimaraners. The most frequently diagnosed disease was DCM but other diseases were identified.

So far, conclusive evidence regarding the potential involvement of helicobacters in development of chronic inflammatory lesions of canine stomach and intestine is missing. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of Helicobacter -like organisms in endoscopic biopsy samples of different parts of the gastrointestinal tract of dogs with chronic inflammation and to reveal their potential relationship to the presence and severity of morphological and inflammatory changes. A total of 183 samples of inflammatory lesions were examined histologically and immunohistochemically. Helicobacter -like organisms were found in 64.1% of samples of gastritis, 5.3% of cases of duodenitis, 47.6% of cases of ileitis and 48% of cases of colitis. The most frequent gastric morphological change was surface epithelial injury. In duodenum epithelial injury together with villous stunting, and in ileum villous stunting were the most commonly observed morphological changes. Crypt dilation/ distortion was the most frequent morphological abnormality among colonic samples and was significantly more often a feature of colitis than duodenitis and ileitis. Our data show no effect of colonization with Helicobacter -like organisms on the presence of gastric pit epithelial injury and gastric mucosal fibrosis. No association was found between the presence/density of Helicobacter -like organisms and the presence or severity of morphological and inflammatory lesions of duodenal, ileal, and colonic mucosa.",

    "abstract": "The histological grade is usually used as a prognostic factor in canine mammary gland carcinomas, but the actual biological behaviour is not always in accordance with this available tool. Disrupted expression of cell adhesion molecules is a very promising way how to predict possible tumour spread. The goal of this study was to detect and quantify the expression of adhesion molecule E-cadherin and β-catenin by means of immunofluorescence and relate the findings with the histological grade in 18 samples of canine mammary gland carcinomas. There is a disruption of β-catenin and E-cadherin expression in canine mammary carcinoma. Significantly positive correlation was found between the expression index of E-cadherin and β-catenin with the histological grade. A significant difference ( P &lt; 0.05) in the membrane index (MI) of β-catenin expression was found between groups of canine mammary carcinomas (CMCs) grade I and II, grade I and III, grade II and III. A significant difference ( P &lt; 0.05) in the MI of E-cadherin expression was also found between groups of CMCs grade I and II, grade I and III, grade II and III. A significant difference ( P &lt; 0.05) in the cytoplasmic index (CI) of β-catenin expression was found between groups of CMCs grade I and II, grade I and III. In the case of CI expression of E-cadherin, no significant difference was found in the expression of E-cadherinin CMCs of different grade. The results of the study show that these adhesion molecules could be promising markers in determining the prognosis of patients with CMCs.",

Haematoxylin and eosin staining was used to evaluate cell morphology, while Gömöri and orcein staining were selected for histochemical studies; molecular genetic studies were represented by polymerase chain reaction.

Formol proved to be the best for preserving cell morphology during both short-term and long-term fixation. Alcohol fixatives mainly affected the nuclear morphology, therefore they are not completely suitable for histomorphological analysis. The best preservation of nuclear morphology was achieved with Bouin’s fixative. For histochemical studies and short-term fixation, fixative solutions of all 3 groups (crosslinking, denaturing fixatives and fixatives combining both denaturing and cross-linking effects) were suitable. For long-term fixation, the alcohol fixative methacarn proved to be the best in histochemical studies. Finally, for molecular genetic studies, methacarn was the best fixative, while Bouin’s fluid was completely unsuitable. Formalin was confirmed as the most universal fixative overall. However, the selection of a suitable fixative should always be made depending on the specific pathological study and the fixation time.",

The 7th sternebra was shorter and more flattened than the other sternebrae in Van cats. In conclusion, three-dimensional models of the thorax and lower respiratory tracts of Van cats were produced in the study. It is thought that the data of the study may be useful in clinical practice and academic studies in the field of veterinary medicine.",

Over the period of four years (2020–2023), biopsies and necropsies of 203 horses were performed; melanocytic tumours were diagnosed in 34 cases (16.75%). Based on the morphological features of the neoplastic cells and presence of distant metastases, 3 horses (8.82%) were diagnosed with early-stage melanocytic lesions, 10 (29.41%) with melanocytomas, 4 (11.76%) with low-grade melanoma, 8 (23.53%) with intermediate-grade melanoma, 6 (17.65%) with metastatic melanoma and 3 (8.82%) with high-grade anaplastic melanoma.

Progesterone (flugeston acetate)-impregnated intravaginal sponges with were used for 5 days in G1 and G2 and 12 days in G3 and G4. All received a 500 IU pregnant mare’s serum gonadotropin (PMSG) injection 48 h before sponge removal and were exposed to bucks 12 h later. Groups G2 and G4 received a 500 IU hCG injection on the eighth day after mating. Groups G1 and G3 did not receive any application after mating. Blood samples were collected on the 8th, 15th, and 22nd days for post-mating progesterone analysis, and pregnancy examinations were performed on the 35th day. The study showed a 90% total oestrus rate (54/60). However, there were no significant differences in conception, pregnancy, and kidding rates among the groups. Serum progesterone concentrations significantly increased on the 15th day in G2 and G4, where hCG was administered. In summary, hCG raised progesterone levels but did not significantly affect the reproductive performance of undernourished, lactating goats in a non-breeding season, suggesting that environmental factors and animal nutrition play a crucial role in synchronization outcomes.",

Urea showed limited cryoprotective potential, with cell survival rates not exceeding 3% at urea concentrations of 20 to 40 mM, which corresponds to reported levels for blood urea in bats. Higher urea concentrations tended to be toxic rather than protective. Importantly, urea appeared to relieve delayed-onset cell death after cell rewarming, and also improved the cryoprotective effect of glucose up to three-fold. Thus, supplementation of cell cultures with a cryoprotectant mix containing urea could increase cell survival rates.",

This variation can affect comparisons between prevalence rates. Animal-level prevalence estimates vary between 5 and 20% (mean ~10%) while herd-levels vary between 0 and 30% in published studies. Intervention thresholds (‘normal herd-level abortion rate’) also vary widely from 1 to 10% depending on the case definition and the underlying region-specific abortion rate. The infectious abortion diagnosis rate globally is ~45% with Neospora caninum being the most commonly detected abortifacient. Thus, the majority of abortions, in particular, sporadic (not outbreak) cases, have no diagnosed cause. However, current advances in the routine application of molecular diagnostics both for pathogens and for lethal alleles is steadily reducing this diagnosis-not-reached rate.",

Nevertheless, they are now threatened by a wide range of negative influences and are increasingly becoming the subject of strict protection. A collection of reference haematological and biochemical indicator ranges can significantly contribute to the assessment of both individual and population health status. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare blood parameters of two sibling species, the lesser mouse-eared bat Myotis blythii and the greater mouse-eared bat Myotis myotis , to assess any differences between males and females and to establish reference intervals for blood parameters. A total of 51 bats were captured (22 × M. blythii , 29 × M. myotis ). Reference ranges were established for haematocrit, haemoglobin, potassium, urea, glucose, pH, partial dissolved carbon dioxide, total dissolved carbon dioxide, bicarbonate, base excess, alanine aminotransferase, calcium, creatinine, total protein and globulin. For most parameters, there was no influence of species or sex; however, species differences were found for albumin, sodium, chloride, phosphorus and anion gap, and sex differences for total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and amylase. The data obtained will prove useful in clinical diagnostics and care of M. myotis and M. blythii in wildlife rescue centres and in research into the effects of infectious diseases, toxic substances or other negative factors affecting these bat species.",

Between 2017 and 2024, 16 binturong (9 females, body mass 9.1–19.3 kg; 7 males, 12–18.7 kg) aged 1.5 to 20.5 years were anaesthetised on 38 occasions in a rescue centre in Laos using one of three anaesthetic protocols based on combinations of ketamine plus the α2 adrenergic receptor agonists medetomidine (n = 12) and/or xylazine (n = 20) plus diazepam (n = 6). No anaesthesia-related health problems or deaths were observed. Binturong administered different anaesthetic protocols showed no differences in time to observation of first signs of sedation (2–7 min) and onset of deep anaesthesia (3–39 min). Heart rate gradually decreased to bradycardia over the 75 min of anaesthesia with ketamine plus medetomidine and, while respiratory rate remained steady, males became hypothermic. Male body temperatures decreased even further when injected with ketamine plus xylazine. All three combined anaesthetic protocols proved safe and effective for repeated use. However, the cardiorespiratory and hypothermic effects observed suggest that medetomidine may be superior to xylazine. Nevertheless, perioperative body temperature monitoring and management will be imperative to prevent inadvertent temperature complications. Our findings improve understanding of binturong responses to anaesthesia and will have positive implications for wildlife veterinarians and conservation medicine.",

Mature lactating goats (n = 130) were divided into primiparous (n = 45) and multiparous groups (n = 85) (body condition score 3, early-middle stage of lactation). Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein and centrifuged to collect plasma; blood metabolites were measured using UV Vis methods. The result showed creatinine concentrations in multiparous goats were significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) higher (0.87 ± 0.21 mg/dl) than in the primiparous group (0.79 ± 0.15 mg/dl). Meanwhile, the albumin concentration in primiparous goats (3.99 ± 0.20 mg/dl) was significantly higher than in multiparous goats (3.82 ± 0.16 mg/dl); also the total cholesterol level of primiparous goats (122.28 ± 29.20 mg/dl) was significantly higher than in multiparous goats (107.37 ± 24.40 mg/dl). The urea-creatinine ratio was higher in primiparous goats (27.07 ± 11.90) than in multiparous goats (22.37 ± 8.12). It was concluded that distinct blood metabolites between primiparous and multiparous goats were due to different physiological needs which led to different mobilization of stored nutrients inside the body. Different feeding strategies were suggested for each parity group following their nutritional needs, such as a high-protein diet to optimize primiparous body development, and a high-energy diet to enhance multiparous milk production before and after giving birth. Further research is needed to understand the exact optimal ratio of feed energy and protein.",

The meat (beef neck and pork topside) was ground through a plate with a hole size of 8 mm. Salt doses were from 0 to 2.0%, at intervals of 0.2%. Each sort of meat was divided into two parts of 350 g: 1) with initial grinding (coarse grinding), and 2) with subsequent grinding through a plate with a hole size of 3 mm (fine grinding). The salt content in fresh pork meat (0% salt) ranged between 0.13 and 0.16%, whereas the content in beef ranged from 0.14 to 0.19% (as analysed by the AAS method). The proportion of added salt had a statistically significant effect on the salt content in meat. No significant differences were found between coarse and fine grinding and between pork and beef meat. The predicted natural salt content in meat was 0.15 and 0.19% for pork, and 0.20 and 0.21% for beef. The proportion of analysed salt was then determined as 0.99–1.06 times the dosed salt. The authors do not recommend the use of the NIR method, which provides reliable results for the main chemical components of meat, i.e. protein and fat, for the determination of the proportions of salt in meat.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this study was to compare and evaluate the protein profiles of healthy cows and cows diagnosed with left displaced abomasum (LDA) (at the first phase of lactation). Cows were admitted to the Clinic of Ruminants, University of Veterinary Medicine and Pharmacy in Košice, Slovakia (UVMP) between 2018 and 2020. Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein to an EDTA tube from 26 cows, 13 healthy ones and 13 diagnosed with LDA. Biochemical indices were determined in a UVMP laboratory and included total protein, albumin, creatinine, urea and total immunoglobulins. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 9.0.0 and two-tailed Student’s t -test. The mean value of total protein was 75.38 ± 14.93 g/l, and 77.84 ± 10.97 g/l for control group and for LDA affected cows, respectively. The mean albumin concentration for the control group was 37.27 ± 6.02 g/l, while for LDA group it was 32.84 ± 8.7 g/l. The mean creatinine and urea concentrations were 99.72 ± 66.88 µmol/l and 4.44 ± 4.47 mmol/l, respectively, in the control group, and 91.67 ± 25.44 µmol/l and 5.09 ± 2.65 mmol/l, respectively, in cows diagnosed with LDA. Total immunoglobulins were at the level of 37.13 ± 7.65 zinc sulphate turbidity test (ZST) in healthy cows whereas LDA group had 32.8 ± 5.2 ZST. Although the difference was not significant ( P &gt; 0.05), protein profiles varied between healthy cows and cows diagnosed with LDA. Further research is needed to determine the differences in protein profiles between groups of larger numbers of individuals.",

Dentitions of sheep and dogs were restored in vivo with a conventional, glass polyalkenoic, chemically activated cement Kavitan Plus with hydrophilic properties capable and with a resinmodified glass-ionomer cement Vitremer with light-induced polymerization and autopolymerization reaction of methyl metacrylate group. The parameters of glass-ionomers were evaluated in 6 groups of animals, 2 animals in each, at various time intervals (after 1, 4 and 6 months in dogs and 3, 6 and 9 months in sheep, starting from the beginning of the experiment). The restorative materials were placed to buccal surfaces of permanent teeth. At the intervals specified, under general injection anaesthesia, throughout the experiment we extracted 24 teeth from sheep and 30 from dogs. When processing the samples of dog's teeth two samples were damaged. One month after the placement, Kavitan plus restorations became loose only in one case in dogs (80% successfulness). In sheep two Kavitan Plus restorations became loose after 9 months (50% successfulness). During the experiment we observed neither cracks nor marginal discoloration in both Kavitan Plus and Vitremer restorations. Statistically significant ( P = 0.04) differences were observed in the dentin of dogs receiving glass-ionomer Vitremer restorations which exhibited lower marginal microgaps. The remaining results were non- significant (ANOVA test). Fluoride ions released from GIC support the treatment of dental hard tissues. These materials could be used as definitive restorations of class A - D cavities in dogs and dental cervical caries in sheep as well as underlying layers ofcomposite and amalgam materials.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of intensive fattening of bulls with a high-grain diet on selected health parameters. Metabolic indicators under study were compared with those in bulls receiving a traditional diet based on maize silage. The trial included 18 Czech pied bulls that were fed a diet containing from 75.0% to 83.6% concentrate on dry matter basis. As a control, 18 Czech pied bulls were used, given total mixed ration based on maize silage. The experiment was started after weaning when the treated group averaged 114 days of age and the control group 115 days of age. Bulls were slaughtered at an average age of 473 days in the treated group and 474 days in the control group. The experiment lasted 359 days. In the fattening period, blood and rumen fluid samples were withdrawn to evaluate rumen fermentation, acid-base balance and selected biochemical indicators. After the slaughter, samples of tuber coxae cancellous tissue were collected for the bone metabolism assessment. Among indicators under study, the rumen fermentation ones were the most affected by feeding the high-grain diet. Bulls fed the high-grain diet showed ( P &lt; 0.05) lower rumen fluid pH and a higher total titration activity, a higher ( P &lt; 0.01) total level of VFA and propionate proportion, and a lower ( P &lt; 0.01) acetate proportion than the control bulls. Counts of infusoria were also lower ( P &lt; 0.01). Acid-base balance was not significantly influenced by feeding the high-grain diet. The high-grain diet fed bulls showed increased serum levels of AST and phosphorus, but the differences from the control group were non-significant in most cases. In 1 g bone ash of the samples of tuber coxae cancellous tissue in the treated group calcium content was significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) lower than in the control group; no significant differences were observed between other indicators under investigation.",

Beside the pineal gland, the presence of MEL was confirmed in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), where it may exert multiple actions. We investigated the effects of a single MEL administration of 0.4, 4.0 and 40.0 μg MEL/ml of tap water on MEL levels in rat plasma, pineal gland and duodenum. In addition, we studied the effect of a prolonged administration of MEL, an anticonvulsant drug phenytoin (PHT) and a combination of MEL+PHT, on MEL concentrations in pregnant rats and their fetuses. Single MEL administration of 4.0 and 40.0 μg MEL/ml resulted in a dose-related increase of MEL concentration in the rat plasma and duodenum but in a decrease of MEL in the pineal gland. After a prolonged MEL administration, MEL levels in duodenal tissues were significantly lower in control group and group treated with PHT as compared to animals, where MEL and PHT were administered simultaneously. A significant increase in MEL concentration was recorded in the intestine of fetuses taken from mothers treated with MEL and MEL + PHT. Our results indicate a dose-related absorption of MEL from tap water to GIT tissues of pregnant rats and their fetuses, where MEL may increase the protection of the intestinal mucose.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the mechanism of autophagy, apoptosis and necrosis in the neurons of infant mice ( Mus musculus ) whose mothers were exposed to carbofuran during the lactation period. This experimental study included 20 mice; carbofuran was administered at LD 50 fractions by gavage to mice at the doses of 1.25 mg/kg body weight (BW) (1/4 LD 50 ), 0.625 mg/kg BW (1/8 LD 50 ), and 0.3125 mg/kg BW (1/16 LD 50 ). Mothers were exposed to carbofuran during lactation on Days 1–9. On Day 10, infant mice were sacrificed in order to determine the number of neuron cells expressing protein kinase B (Akt) and the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) as autophagy pathway using immunohistochemistry, apoptosis using the Tunel Assay, and necrosis using haematoxylin and eosin staining. The results of Akt, mTORC1, apoptosis, and cell necrosis were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Duncan tests. The results of the study showed that exposing the mothers to carbofuran during lactation caused an increase in necrosis and apoptosis of neuronal cells but did not cause autophagy in neuron cells via the Akt/mTOR pathway of infant mice. The increase in apoptotic neurons opens up opportunities for the prevention and handling of the effects of reactive oxygen species activities due to carbofuran exposure during lactation periods.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted as an in vivo experiment in adult miniature pigs with the aim to test two new biomaterials. An iatrogenic defect was made into the central femoral diaphysis in the experimental animals and subsequently fixated by bridging plate osteosynthesis. Into the defect we implanted a cancellous autograft (control group), a pasty injectable scaffold (EXP A), and a porous 3D cylinder (EXP B). Radiological examination was performed in all animals at 0, 10, 20, 30 weeks after surgical procedure and histological assessment was performed. In the newly formed bone the osteoblastic activity was monitored. In terms of radiology, the most effective method was observed in the control group (completely healed 100%) compared to experimental groups EXP A (70.0%) and EXP B (62.5%). Histological assessment showed a higher cell count in the place of bone defect in the control group compared to experimental groups. Between the experimental groups, a higher count of bone marrow cells was found in group EXP B. Both newly developed biomaterials seem to be suitable as replacements for large bone defects, having good workability and applicability. However, compared to the control group treated with a cancellous autograft, the newly formed bone did not reach the same number of cells settling in and in some cases, full radiological healing was not reached. Nevertheless, the material was found to be grown into the original bone in all cases within the experimental groups. The new biomaterials have a great potential as a substitute in the treatment of large bone defects.",

In the year of 2014, a total of 411 samples (rectal swabs or faeces)from pigs of various age categories (sows, gilts and suckling piglets) were collected. The sampling was performed more than 24 months after the ban of ceftiofur on the farm.The sows and gilts were sampled repeatedly before and after farrowing. All collected samples were directly cultivated on MacConkey agar (MCA) containing cefotaxime (2 mg/l) and obtained sub-cultures were tested for ESBL production by double disc synergy test. According to our results, all gilts were negative for ESBL-producing E. coli in the introduction period, however, the excretion of ESBL-producing E. coli was observed before and after delivery. Most of the new-born piglets from positive sows and gilts shed ESBL-producing E. coli early after birth. All tested ESBL-producing isolates were resistant to multiple antimicrobials, suggesting that antibiotics from other groups used for therapy co-select for ESBL producers in pigs on the studied farm. Intestinal colonization of lactating sows and their offspring as well as survival of ESBL-producing E. coli in the farm environment should be recognised as important risk factors of circulation and long-time persistence of ESBL producers in the herd.",

    "abstract": "Artificial insemination (AI) is the most frequently used assisted reproductive technique for captive propagation of rare avian species. As semen quality is critical for reproductive success, baseline data are needed for evaluating and selecting the best male bird donors. To this end, we used computer-assisted semen analysis to assess male eastern imperial eagles (n = 7), northern goshawks (n = 24) and peregrine falcons (n = 20). While imperial eagles and northern goshawks donate ejaculate voluntarily, peregrine falcons required cloacal massage. Eight peregrine falcon females were inseminated with semen from eight males, with fresh ejaculates (15 to 50 µl) applied to the pars uterina of the oviduct immediately after collection and examination. All females were inseminated within 2 h of laying an egg. A fertilization rate of 70% was achieved using this method. Minimum semen characteristics associated with egg fertilization included a semen concentration of 115.12 × 10 6 /ml, 33.52% total motility, 1.92% spermatozoa with progressive motility and 0.17% with rapid motility. Comparative data on spermatozoa concentration and kinematics suggest that eastern imperial eagles concentrate on high quality semen investment at the start of the breeding season, northern goshawks compensate for a decrease in motility-associated parameters with increased semen concentration and peregrine falcons maintain semen production standards throughout the breeding season. Our data show that, in birds of prey, levels of egg fertilization following AI with fresh semen can be almost as successful as after natural mating.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this retrospective study was to compare the effects of the two methods (laparoscopic or laparotomic) of LDA (left displaced abomasum) correction under field conditions by means of survival rate and biochemical profile evaluation. Holstein cows from one farm with LDA over a 20-month period were included in the study. Cows underwent laparoscopic abomasopexy (Janowitz’s method, LS) or a laparotomic right flank omentopexy (Dirksen’s method, LT). Blood samples for biochemical analysis were taken just prior to surgery (D1) and on days 10 (D10) and 30 (D30) following surgery. Blood profiles of healthy cows identified from the farm’s routine transition cow monitoring program were used as control (C). Aiming to minimize disruptive effects of quite a long period of data collection, the cows’ biochemical profile was evaluated in three orthogonal comparisons: LS cows vs. control group, LT cows vs. control group, and LS cows vs. LT cows. The rate of animal survival was similar for both methods (loss of about 11% until 30 days after treatment). Most of the blood parameters from LS and LT groups were comparable in all three sampling terms indicating continual organism recovery. At D10 the difference of higher cholesterol concentration and lower haptoglobin concentration were favourable for the LS group ( P &lt; 0.05). Total protein, calcium, magnesium and albumin showed more positive dynamics in the LS group too. This proves previous laboratory and clinical indices of expediency of LDA laparoscopy treatment under field conditions.",

Tylosin was administered orally to pubertal male and female rats at concentrations of 0.005, 0.2, 10 and 200 mg/kg b.w. for 6 weeks. The overall body and organ weights were recorded. Serum levels of immunoglobulins, haematological values, histopathological lesions in different organs, and gene expression profiles in pituitary glands were investigated. The mean platelet volume was increased, and the monocyte count was decreased significantly in both male and female rats treated with tylosin. Compared to the untreated control, alanine transaminase in both types of rats and total serum bilirubin in female rats were increased significantly with the administration of tylosin (200 mg/kg), however, lactate dehydrogenase in female rats was decreased. The levels of immunoglobulin M were reduced in both male and female rats but immunoglobulin G levels were significantly reduced only in female rats which were treated with tylosin. Cell proliferation- and adhesion-associated genes were expressed more but apoptosis gene expressions were decreased in the pituitary gland of tylosin-treated rats. In conclusion, this study revealed that the use of tylosin at therapeutic dosage is possibly not completely safe.",

    "abstract": "Diethylnitrosamine is well known for its toxic and carcinogenic properties affecting mainly liver and kidneys. Capsaicin has been proven in previous years as a promising protective agent against many health problems affecting modern people. In this study we used diethylnitrosamine induced mouse experimental model of liver and kidney damage to assess the potential chemopreventive effect of capsaicin in vivo . Fifty female ICR mice were randomly divided into five groups intraperitoneally administered 1% ethanol solution in controls, capsaicin to assess its toxicity, diethylnitrosamine alone, and diethylnitrosamine and capsaicin in combination in different manners in two groups. After 14 weeks all mice were sacrificed, complete necropsy was performed and liver and kidneys were used for further examination. Slides of both organs stained with haematoxylin and eosin were histologically evaluated and immunohistochemical detection of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and glutamine synthetase in the liver tissue was performed. Histological evaluation of the liver and kidneys revealed toxic damage of diethylnitrosamine treated animals, whereas mice that received the combination of the substances showed milder lesions. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression was lower in diethylnitrosamine treated animals compared to the control and capsaicin groups, pointing to a disruption of the proliferative activity of hepatocytes in the juvenile liver. Glutamine synthetase expression did not differ between the groups, indicating that no tumours were induced by any of the substances used in our study. In conclusion, our experiment demonstrated the toxic properties of diethylnitrosamine in mice liver and kidneys, with the promising beneficial effect of capsaicin.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the study was to evaluate the clinical and laboratory outcome after the surgical treatment of a single congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunt using an ameroid constrictor. Patient medical records were reviewed in retrospect. Data on the signalment, clinical signs, preoperative bile acid stimulation test and ammonia concentration were recorded. The surgical treatment success rate was evaluated by mortality in the perioperative and short-term postoperative period and by the long-term clinical outcome. Bile acid stimulation test and ammonia concentration were also analysed 2–3 days, 4–6 weeks, and 6–8 weeks postoperatively. No patient died in the selected periods. The long-term clinical outcome was excellent in 15 out of 20 patients, good in 3 out of 20 patients and poor in 2 out of 20 patients. Preprandial bile acid concentration was elevated in 96.00%, postprandial bile acid concentration in 100.00% and ammonia concentration in 80.95% of patients preoperatively. A significant decrease was found in postprandial bile acid and ammonia 2–3 days postoperatively and in preprandial bile acid 4–6 weeks postoperatively. A significant decrease in liver function parameters in days post operation indicates a rapid restoration of hepatic function. The surgical treatment of a single extrahepatic portosystemic shunt using an ameroid constrictor is a successful method of treatment for this type of portosystemic shunt, with as much as 75.00% of the patients having an excellent long-term clinical outcome.",

Blood samples were obtained at selected time periods: T0 = no longer than 30 min before surgery; T1 = first day after surgery; T2 = second day after surgery. In addition to protein C activity assessment, haematological and haemostaseological analysis was also performed. The mean protein C activity was the lowest at T1 and the highest at T2. No significant relationship between protein C activity and mortality, duration of clinical signs, degree of gastric torsion, gastric necrosis, splenectomy and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy was found in patients with gastric dilatation and volvulus.

    "abstract": "Severe spinal cord injury (SCI) resulting in permanent sensory-motor and autonomic dysfunction caudal to a damaged spinal cord (SC) segment is a catastrophic event in human as well as in veterinary medicine. The situation of paraplegic/tetraplegic people or animals is further impaired by serious complications and often displays an image of permanent suffering. Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) has shown neuroprotective capacity in numerous experimental and several clinical studies or case reports. Hence, the method draws increasing attention of neuroscientists as well as health care workers. While systemic TH is a too complex procedure for veterinary practice, local application of TH with a reduced risk of the whole body temperature fluctuations and minimal side effects can become one of the therapeutic tools considered in the treatment of acute traumatic SCIs in bigger animals, especially when surgical decompression of spinal medulla and vertebral column reconstruction is indicated. Still, additional large prospective randomized studies are essential for the standardization of therapeutic protocols and the introduction of the method into therapeutic armamentarium in canine and feline spinal traumatology. The research strategy involved a PubMed, MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), and ISI Web of Science search from January 2000 to July 2021 using the terms “canine and feline spinal cord injuryˮ, “hypothermiaˮ, and “targeted temperature managementˮ in the English language literature; also references from selected studies were scanned and relevant articles included.",

There was a positive correlation between the thyroid-stimulating hormone and body weight, left atrium size and the serum NT-proBNP concentration in patients with preclinical DCM. Euthyroid dogs with DCM had higher total thyroxine values and more ventricular premature complexes than hypothyroid dogs.

    "abstract": "African swine fever (ASF) is highly contagious haemorrhagic viral disease of domestic pigs and wild boars. The causative agent can be transmitted by direct contact with infected animals or via a contaminated environment, fomites, feed, meat and products thereof. Soft ticks (genus Ornithodoros ) are known reservoirs and transmission vectors of the virus. As the disease causes serious problems in many countries, rapid detection of the agent and early diagnosis could help in prevention of its spread. Therefore, a multiple-analyte profile (xMAP) technology based on multiple oligonucleotide ligation followed by polymerase chain reaction (MOL-PCR) was introduced and verified. A system targeting two independent loci of the virus genome was designed to increase the likelihood of different strains detection and an internal control was employed to verify the correct course of the analysis. The sensitivity was experimentally determined as 10 genomic copies of the virus in one µl of isolated DNA. The system was verified on samples originating from a recent ASF outbreak in the Czech Republic (six spleen) and the Czech market (eight liver and heart tissues) with real-time polymerase chain reaction used as a reference method. The results of both methods were in agreement, even in samples with a low concentration of the virus genome (9.45 × 10 1 genomic copies/µl of DNA). The system introduced represents an open method allowing the detection and semi-quantification of up to 50 targets/agents in one reaction. It can, therefore, be used for rapid one-step screening and as an effective tool for risk management.",

    "abstract": "Dogs are hosts of parasites with different pathogenicities and zoonotic risks. The aim of our study was to assess factors that could affect the occurrence of endoparasitic infections in dogs using questionnaires for owners and examining canine faeces. Based on the responses of dog owners, we evaluated ways of the preventive and therapeutic use of antiparasitic drugs. One faecal sample was obtained from each dog (391 samples total), and then examined by flotation, larvoscopic, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. We focused on zoonotic tapeworms Echinococcus multilocularis and Taenia crassiceps . The answers in the dog owners’ questionnaires showed that owners most often dewormed their dogs irregularly (96.4%), namely, twice a year (24.3%). In coprological examinations the following parasites were detected: Giardia spp., Cystoisospora ohioensis complex , Neospora caninum / Hammondia heydorni , Toxocara canis , Toxascaris leonina , Capillaria spp., Trichuris spp., Angiostrongylus vasorum , Crenosoma vulpis , Ancylostoma spp. and Taenia spp. A total of 4 out of 391 PCR investigated samples of faeces were positive for DNA of Taenia species. Sequences were obtained for 3 of them, confirming 100% identity with T. crassiceps . The zoonotic helminths Toxocara canis were the more prevalent species (9.3%, 4.3%, 1.9% group A, B, C). We consider the presence of T. crassiceps in 3 dog faecal samples to be serious due to its zoonotic potential. Data collected within this study showed that the prevention against endoparasites carried out at the breeders’ discretion is insufficient to ensure the health of their dogs or to cover the risk of zoonotic transmission.",

    "abstract": "The survival of captive-reared pheasants in the wild depends primarily on their ability to avoid predators, therefore, pheasants need to maintain their innate anti-predatory behaviour. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of age and disturbance on tonic immobility (TI) in pheasants ( Phasianus colchicus ) kept in a commercial rearing facility. TI tests were performed in pheasants aged 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 weeks. Randomly selected pheasants of the same age were tested either immediately after capture (group C) or after exposure to various stimuli/disturbance (group D). No significant differences in the number of attempts to induce TI were found between the observed groups of pheasants (the vast majority of pheasants remained immobile on the first attempt). The effect of age was found only in group D, where birds aged 14 and 16 weeks showed a reduction in the duration of TI compared to younger birds. In group C, the duration of TI in pheasants of different ages did not differ. The results document a change in the duration of TI in response to an intense stimulus depending on the age of captive-reared pheasants. Knowledge of changes in anti-predatory behaviour depending on age and habituation to the environment and new stimuli is essential when determining the optimal age for pheasants to be released into the wild considering its impact on the subsequent survival of the released birds. Birds released at an older age and thus accustomed to repeated disturbances during captive rearing may have impaired defence behaviour.",

The monitoring was performed in male Wistar rats which were housed after weaning either individually (n = 8) or in pairs (n = 8) for 33 days. In the open field, rats kept in isolation reared less often ( P &lt; 0.05) than pair-housed rats. In the elevated plus-maze test, pair-housed rats entered the open arm more frequently ( P = 0.002) and stayed in the closed arm less often ( P = 0.019) compared to rats housed in isolation. In the forced swim test, climbing was seen more frequently ( P = 0.016) in pair-housed rats whereas immobility was more common ( P = 0.006) in rats housed individually. In the novel object recognition test, the pair-housed rats preferred ( P = 0.014) the novel object whereas there was no difference ( P = 0.107) in time spent by exploring familiar and novel objects in rats housed in isolation. Furthermore, juvenile rats housed for 33 days in isolation showed higher ( P = 0.003) body weight gain during the monitored period than rats housed for the same period in pairs. Our findings are important not only in terms of assessing the impact of rat housing on their mental and physical development but also in terms of the accurate interpretation of the results of other experiments where the rat is used as a model organism.",

    "abstract": "Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a mycotoxin produced by several moulds of Aspergillus and Penicillium genera on many agricultural commodities used for feed production. It is primarily a nephrotoxic substance, but it can also cause immunosuppression in pigs and increase their susceptibility to infections. Porcine mycotoxic nephropathy (PMN) is a chronic poisoning associated with OTA exposure. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the content of OTA in pig kidneys which were examined during the regular monitoring of the safety and quality of food of animal origin in the Czech Republic during the years 2012–2021. Results revealed no differences between the monitored years or age categories and no differences between the year seasons, which could have an influence on the storage conditions and thus feed contamination by moulds. The values found in this study are low and similar to those assessed in several studies performed in other European countries and do not exceed the limits set in their legislation, which means these organs do not pose a risk for consumers and do not indicate PMN in monitored pigs. Czech Republic as well as EU legislation do not regulate OTA levels in the food of animal origin yet.",

    "abstract": "A horse needs to move in different gaits and carry a rider during riding. Therefore, the equine back must be in a good functional state. Preventing back disorders is one of the keys to ensuring a horse’s health. This study aimed to assess cranial osteopathy therapy as a treatment and prevention method for preventing and reducing back pain. Thirty-two thoroughbred horses were categorised by their backs’ functional status (16 without back pain and 16 with back pain). The mechanical nociceptive threshold was determined before and after osteopathic treatment by an algometer (pain test FPX 100) with pressure points between T14-T15, T18-L1, and L5-L6. The data were analysed with a significance of P &lt; 0.05. The study found that cranial osteopathic therapy raised the mechanical nociceptive threshold average in 83.3% measured points for horses without back pain and in 50% measured points for those with back pain. This study revealed that both horses without back pain and horses with back pain had a positive response to cranial osteopathic therapy, as evidenced by the increased nociceptive threshold limits, indicating that osteopathic therapy can be used as a primary or additional treatment method for back dysfunction.",

The aim of the present study was to verify the effect of antibiotics on canine dental biofilm bacteria due to increasing antibiotic resistance. Dental biofilm samples were taken from six dogs before and after administration of antibiotics, specifically, the combination of spiramycin and metronidazole. The samples were cultured on solid media under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA gene was used to identify bacterial isolates. In addition, total bacterial DNA was extracted from samples from one dog and the V3−V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Using cultivation, 55 isolates belonging to 4 phyla were isolated before antibiotics administration, and 36 isolates belonging to 3 phyla were isolated after antibiotics administration. A significant decrease was noted in the genera Porphyromonas , Neisseria and Frederiksenia , whereas there was a significant increase in the genus Streptococcus . Of the total microbiota, there were 69 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to 11 phyla before antibiotics administration, and 51 OTUs belonging to 8 phyla after antibiotics administration. A significant decrease was recorded in the genus Porphyromonas , while a significant increase in the genus Capnocytophaga . The significant effect of spiramycin and metronidazole on the genus Porphyromonas at the time of their administration was confirmed by both cultivation and amplicon sequencing.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the nephrotoxicity of suxibuzone using the recommended dosage in euhydrated horses. Serum creatinine levels were used to monitor for the presence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in 11 systemically healthy horses treated orally with suxibuzone at the recommended dosage for five days. Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), urine gamma glutamyl transferase/urine creatinine, fractional excretion of sodium, urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, and urine sediment were assessed as additional monitoring parameters. A significant increase in creatinine was found in treated horses ( P = 0.002), 27% (3/11) of treated horses were classified as having AKI compared to 0% of controls (0/10), and a strong correlation was found between the change in creatinine and the change in SDMA in treated horses (τ = 0.645, P = 0.012). The results of this study suggest that treatment with suxibuzone at the recommended dosage can induce AKI even in systemically healthy euhydrated horses.",

Hepatic and renal biomarker levels, cortisol and testosterone synthesis, mercury concentration, relative weight of organs, and tissue architecture were studied. The results showed a significant decrease in the plasma alkaline phosphatase (ALP), plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST), serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), plasma testosterone levels, and relative weight of the liver, testes, and adrenal in the mercury treated group (group M), while the other indices were significantly increased in the m-group compared to the control (group C). However, the group treated with olive oil combined with mercury (group O) showed a significant decrease in the ALP, AST, ALT, testosterone levels, and adrenal relative weight, while plasma creatinine, uric acid levels, mercury concentration in organs, and the kidney relative weight were significantly increased. Vitamin E supplementation (group E) led to a significant decrease in the ALP, testosterone levels, and adrenal relative weight, a significant increase was observed in plasma levels of triglycerides, creatinine, and uric acid. Histological sections of the liver, kidney, testis, and adrenal of group M showed severe tissue damage, while the other groups showed less important tissue alterations demonstrating that supplementation with natural or synthetic antioxidants can protect against the toxicity of heavy metals such as mercury, improving the health of rabbits.",

These patients are typically smaller than their siblings and have obtunded mentation, strabismus, and a range of visual deficits. Surgery is recommended mostly in cases where conservative medical treatment is not effective, but surgery is sometimes not accepted by owners and they opt for humane euthanasia. A 6-month-old female Great Dane was referred to our clinic with ataxia, disorientation, blindness, and seizures. Ventrolateral strabismus, hypermetria, and delayed postural reactions were observed at admission. Congenital hydrocephalus was diagnosed and confirmed with magnetic resonance imaging. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. The dog responded well to surgical intervention, neurological deficits improved after surgery. To our knowledge, this is the first described case of ventriculoperitoneal shunt application in a giant breed dog. The dog is nearly two months post surgery, with no recorded seizures, and it is gradually improving neurologically. The presented clinical case is unique due to the breed and also due to the fact that owners of large breeds of dogs usually have much greater expenses for their therapy compared to small breeds, which makes them rare cases in clinical practice that are rarely reported in veterinary literature.",

    "abstract": "The Babesia genus includes tick-borne haemoprotozoan parasites that infect a wide variety of vertebrate hosts, both domestic and wild, around the world. Babesia spp. cause oxidative stress by increasing the number of free radicals in erythrocytes. Among this genus, Babesia ovis causes babesiosis in sheep and goats, especially in tropical and subtropical regions, causing significant economic losses. In this study, we aimed to determine the presence and prevalence of B. ovis in sheep in Siirt province, Türkiye, using molecular method and to evaluate some oxidant/antioxidant parameters in infected sheep. The animal material used in this study consisted of a total of 500 sheep. DNA extraction, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification and sequence analysis of blood samples and Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) analysis of serum samples were performed. As a result of the study, 84 of the 500 samples (16.80%) examined were PCR positive. Advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) and nitric oxide (NO) concentrations were found to be higher in sheep with babesiosis compared to the control group. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was higher in the control group and catalase (CAT) activity was higher in infected sheep. As a result of this study, the presence of Babesia ovis was detected in all districts of Siirt province. It has been determined that infection caused by Babesia ovis in sheep causes oxidative stress as a result of increased nitric oxide and oxidized protein levels and this process may participate in the pathology of the disease.",

To investigate the presence of Anaplasma spp. blood samples with EDTA were taken from animals aged two years and older between 05.00 am and 10.00 am. Then a blood smear was prepared with the Diff-Quick staining method and examined under the light microscope at a × 100 magnification with immersion in oil. In addition, 40 randomly selected positive blood samples were analysed by the Nested PCR method. A total of 3,051 blood samples were examined by the Diff-Quick staining method. One hundred eleven of 966 samples (11.49%) in Kırklareli province and 297 of 2,085 (14.24%) samples in Tekirdag province were positive. As a result of nested PCR on 40 randomly selected positive samples from both provinces, the rates of A. marginale , A. centrale , and mixed infection ( A. marginale and A. centrale ) were determined as 34.5%, 4.0%, and 61.5% respectively. Of the 140 positive cattle, 70 were treated with oxytetracycline (Group 1), and the other 70 ones were treated with oxytetracycline-imidocarb combination (Group 2) twice with two month intervals for comparison. At the third examination, the rate of latent infection in the group treated with oxytetracycline-imidocarb combination was lower than in the group treated with oxytetracycline alone, but the difference was not significant ( P &gt; 0.05). As a result, it was revealed that anaplasmosis is a common disease in cattle in the Thrace region, and the combination of oxytetracycline and imidocarb was shown to be more successful than using oxytetracycline alone in reducing latent infected anaplasmosis cases.",

The objective of this study was to assess the quality of colostrum on dairy farms of different sizes. A total of 660 colostrum samples were obtained from 28 farms in 11 provinces in Türkiye. The colostrum samples were divided into five groups according to dairy farms size: Group I (1–100, n = 26), Group II (101–200, n = 37), Group III (201–500, n = 200), Group IV (501–1000, n = 235), Group V (&gt; 1000, n = 162). Colostrum quality was assessed by a Brix refractometer (≤ 22% indicates poor quality colostrum) and evaluated statistically. The mean colostrum Brix% was 27.74 ± 0.14. The Brix% in Groups I–V were 24.04 ± 0.72, 25.70 ± 0.93, 28.11 ± 0.26, 28.46 ± 0.23 and 27.30 ± 0.21, respectively.

The research was carried out at Bursa Uludag University Research and Application Center of Veterinary Medicine. The animal material for the study consisted of 35 Saanen kids. Birth weight, 30th day, 60th day, 90th day, and 120th day live weights of Saanen kids were observed as 3.29 kg, 8.02 kg, 12.68 kg, 18.41 kg, and 21.26 kg, respectively. Birth weights were affected by maternal age and sex ( P &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference between body weight and birth type. Comparisons of body weight between the 30th day melatonin-treated and 60th day melatonin-treated groups and the control group showed no significant differences. The findings underscore the potential of melatonin as a growth-promoting agent in goat farming, aligning with previous research that has demonstrated its positive effects on growth trajectories in various livestock species. Moreover, maternal age was found to positively influence birth weights, while no significant differences were observed based on the birth type. These findings contribute valuable insights into optimizing growth strategies in goat husbandry, highlighting the need for further comprehensive studies to fully elucidate the mechanisms and long-term effects of melatonin supplementation on growth and development in Saanen goats.",

Microclimatic variables (temperature, relative humidity, air velocity, airborn particles expressed in particulate matter [PM], aerial germ load and gaseous pollutants) of a conventional calf barn and outdoor placed small-group hutches with pens were real-time monitored in a dairy herd by mounted sensors from summer to winter. Among the risk factors for BRDC, the small-group outdoor rearing units were characterized by high relative humidity, air velocity, and PM2.5 particulate matter concentration. Although the conventional calf barn was poorly ventilated, most variables were more favourable than expected, in which proper farm management may have played a role. We were able to identify long term and intraday periods with limit-breaking values, daily fluctuations as well as specific patterns of individual indicators in different calf husbandry environments. Based on obtained data, contributing technological processes may be reviewed and the effect of changes can be monitored under farm conditions. In addition, assessment of prevailing microclimatic conditions os also possible before investing in modernization of calf rearing units.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of intraperitoneal tryptophan (Trp) administration on liquid diet consumption in early weaned piglets. Furthermore, the effects of two chemical forms of the amino acid were compared. Single doses (100 mg.kg- l ) ofL-tryptophan (480 mmol.kg- l ) or L-tryptophan methyl ester (392 mmol.kg-l ) (Sigma, USA) were L p. administered at 07.00 h to 2 groups of 5 piglets each at the age of 3,9, 12, 14 and 16 days. The piglets were weaned on d I, housed individually in cages and offered a commercial diet (Selasan) for suckling from feeding bottles between 06.00 and 22.00 h 9 times a day at 2-h intervals with an 8-h break at night. Control piglets (n=5) were left intact. Compared with intact controls, L-Trp decreased the relative sizes of individual meals in piglets aged 3 d only 5 h (P < 0.02) after its administration, in the 9-d-old ones 1,3 and 5 h (P < 0.05; P < 0.01; P < 0.05, respectively), and in the 16-d-old piglets 3 h (P < 0.01) later. No significant differences between control and L-Trp-treated animals occurred on days 12 and 14. L-Trp methyl ester decreased the diet consumption of piglets at all ages as follows: in 3-, 9- and 16-d-old piglets 3 h (P < 0.05; P < 0.05; P < 0.01, respectively) post-injection, in the 12-d-old animals I h (P <0.01), 3 h (P< 0.001) and 7 h (P< 0.05), and in the 14-d-old piglets I h (P<O.OI) and 3 h (P < 0.01) after L-Trp methyl ester administration. In 12- and 14-d-old piglets its effect was also reflected in 24-h diet intake that was significantly decreased. Similar differences in diet consumption were found when the relative sizes of individual meals were compared to the first morning consumption, Le. I h before Trp treatment. In conclusion, Trp did suppress food consumption in early weaned piglets as soon as on day 3 after birth, indicating that the aminostatic component of their food intake regulation is functional at this age. At the same time it was found that this effect ofL-ttp methyl ester (the actual dose of which was smaller than that ofL-Trp) occurs earlier, is more profound and lasts longer than that ofL-Trp.

The aim of the study was to compare the basic haematological parameters in peripheral blood of captive Japanese quail employed as model organisms for research in cosmic biology. In the first experimental series, red blood cell count (RBC), white blood cell count (WBC), haemoglobin concentration, and erythrocytic indices, i. e. mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) of 207 clinically healthy birds of both sexes was studied. The quail were kept in groups in cages under standard laboratory conditions. In the second series, 55 female individuals exposed to experimental hypodynamy (birds suspended in a special device) for up to 90 days were used. A total of262 blood samples were analyzed for haematological parameters, and 5629 haematological data were evaluated using variation statistics. Analysis of the first series made possible to establish a range of physiological values ofRBC and WBC counts with significant (P < 0.05) sex differences in RBC counts. In general, the blood of these birds showed a high oxygenating capacity and a remarkable lymphocytic character. Haematological parameters of quail females exposed to artificial hypodynamy for 60 days remained unaffected. However, by the end of this exposure lasting for 90 days, a mild decrease occurred in some indices. It can be concluded that Japanese quail have shown an excellent adaptation ability and can serve as a suitable model organism for the study of cosmic physiology. Japanese quail, cosmic biology, haematology, hypodynamy Efficient use of Japanese quail (Cotumix cotumix japonica) as a model organism for simulated and real cosmic flight experiment requires a detailed study of its physiological functions, including the respiratory, circulatory and immune ones. In this type of original studies, however, even more detailed data are required than those commonly available in literature (S turkie 1986; C amp be 11 1989 a. 0.). Haematological data on Japanese quail are, to our knowledge, still rather fragmentary. The first more systematical approach was that of A tw al (1964) who studied its ontogeny. Similar basic information is provided in studies by N irmalan and Ro bin son (1971). In papers by Mor g an (1980) and others, again only selected haematological data are presented. Therefore in the first part of our study, detailed haematological parameters were determined in a population of Japanese quail bred at the Institute of Biochemistry and Genetics of the Slovak Academy of Sciences. In the second part, the same parameters were studied under condition of simulated hypodynamy. Such information is of paramount importance for any later comparison with data obtained from birds flown under real microgravity conditions during a space flight.",

The new 'Greenhouse SVET-2' experiment is a Russian-American-Bulgarian Experiment planned for the Spacelab-Mir-I (SLM-I) mission in 1995. It includes two plantings, desigened (I) to test the capability of the Bulgarian SVET space greenhouse with the American SIS to grow a crop of wheat from seed to seed for 120 days, and (2) to provide green plant material for post flight analysis. The 'Greenhouse S VET -2' experiment was prepared by the Russian crew (January and February 95) and continued by the American astronaut (from March to June 95). The plant samples and root modules used during the experiment will be returned to Earth on the SHUTTLE. Plants. growth, leaf area, soil, moisture, sensors The investigation of ecological problems concerning the creation of closed biospheric systems, based on the biological recycling of the chemical elements is one of the basic scientific problems of our civilization. It is related to the future manned space missions and will be of essential importance if an ecological disaster takes place. Scientific research on these problems entitled' Study of the ways and means for the use of higher plants, algae and animals in the biological life support systems for the space crews' within the INTERCOSMOS Program started in 1984. Under the co-ordinating role of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP), Moscow, Russia, scientists from several countries joined their efforts to design and develop instruments and new technologies. These are directed towards the design of separate units of the future Biological Life Support System (BLSS) which allows a natural food production, air and water regeneration (I van 0 v a et al. 1993). A new model of device 'INCUBATOR-2' was designed in Bratislava, Slovakia, and tested onboard 'MIR' orbital station for chicken incubation (Japanese quail) in 1990 (B 0 d a et al. 1991). In an experiment with 43 incubated eggs 21 were fertilized and 8 viable quail were hatched. After emerging from the shell, they were rotating, unable to stop and orient themselves in space and also unable to feed. They were fed by the cosmonauts. In the next flight experiment with adult Japanese quail running from 1 to 9 of August 1990 on the 'MIRKV ANT' complex the behaviour of animals in weightlessness and after their bringing back to Earth was observed (B 0 d a and Bar a nov 1992). The experiments in the field of avian micro gravity were carried out in 1992 and will continue in the MIR -SHUTTLE-95 mission. A new type of space greenhouse named 'SVET' for higher plants growing was created in Sofia, Bulgaria. 'SVET' Space Greenhouse (SG) is a full-automatic operating and controlling system for higher plant growth. The 'SVET' SG was mounted on the 'KRISTALL' technological module, docked with the 'MIR' orbital space station on June 10, 1990. The Soviet cosmonauts Balandin and Solovyov started the first experiments with sowing seed of radish and cabbage on June 15, 1990. The first 29-days (dried) and 54-days fresh plants were obtained and brought back to Earth to be studied on August 10, 1990 (Ivanova and Dandolov 1991).",

Bmo 1996,65: 57-64. Japanese quail line resistant to hypodynamy have been selected during 12 generations. Cumu­ lative egg-production throughout 14 days lasting hypodynamy was used as the selection criterion. In each generation one half of quail with the highest egg-laying was chosen to the subsequent gene­ ration. The average egg-production during hypodynamy in selected line was higher than in con­ trol. There was a small decrease in body weight detected in the selected line during hypodynamy, but food intake was increased. Egg weight, especially the egg shell weight, fertility and hatchabi1ity was in selected line higher in course of rearing. There were significant differences in response of the endocrine system represented by hormones (catecholamines, corticosterone. thyroid hor­ mones, estradiol) and some indicators of intermediary metabolism (protein, glucose, cholesterol, triacylglycerols, polyunsaturated fatty acids) between nonselected and selected line of Japanese­ quail to short hypodynamy treatment. Japanese quail, endocrine and metabolic profile, egg, selected line, nonselected line The Japanese quail in Earth conditions shows a fair number of performance qualities, the most important being the high coefficient of feed conversion into the egg proteins. From this aspect an inclusion of the Japanese quail in a closed spaceship ecosystem was considered, with the aim to provide food for astronauts (B 0 d a 1993). In order to survive in specific conditions of space flights, such as weightlessness and limi­ ted space, an organism must be able of quick adaptation. In Earth condition the hypodyna­ my simulates the weightlessness in space and is usually used in experiments of similar type (Kovalenko 1977). Obviously the reactions of neurohumoral system have been used as indicator of normal or stressogenic situation of organism.",

The phannaceutical was administered orally on 6 consecutive days at a dose of 415 mg. kg-I per day to each of 19 moufflons infected naturally with Mullerius capillaris, Chabertia ovina and Nematodirus spp. Their fecal samples collected before, during and after ivermectin administration were examined. On days 14,21 and 28 after the treatment was finished, 2 animals were shot, respectively. Their lungs, duodena, colon and ceaca were necropsied for the parasites. Parasitological examination of the organs proved a good helminthicidal efficacy of the preparation including that against the adult Mullerius capillaris. Based on examination of pooleq fecal samples it was shown that ivermectin rapidly stopped also the elimination of infective forms (eggs and larvae) of the helminths. The drug was readily consumed and well tolerated. The animals did not show signs of side effects. Mullerius capillaris, Chabertia ovina, Nematodirus spp., necropsy, GIT, lungs",

    "abstract": "Grass carp reovirus (GCRV) has been assigned to a newly established Aquareovirus genus in the family of Reoviridae which leads to haemorrhagic disease and extremely high mortality rate in grass carp. In this study, comparison was made between the novel one-step reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detection of grass carp reovirus. The result indicated that RT-LAMP had × 10 higher sensitivity comparable to RT-PCR. The specificity of the two methods for GCRV detection were both developed successfully by other three aquatic viruses. In the field trial, both RT-PCR and RT-LAMP methods were applied to detect the samples from different infected organs and tissues. The result demonstrated that RT-LAMP had a high accuracy to confirm the diagnosis as well as the RT-PCR. This study showed that the RT-LAMP, compared to the RT-PCR, was simple, time-saving, convenient, but required specificity primers and possibly generated false positive product. Its products, unlike RT-PCR, could not be direcly used in further molecular research after purification. Thus RT-LAMP might be an optimal diagnostic method for rapid and preliminary diagnosis of GCRV infection in resource-limited setting situation.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the present study was to evaluate in a model organism the effect of different dietary lipids on plasma concentration of total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triacylglycerols (TAG). One hundred adult male rats (Wistar Albino) were divided into 10 groups with 10 animals each and fed for 7 weeks either basic feed mixture (control diet, C) or basic feed mixture with 5% of palm oil (P), safflower oil (SF), salmon oil (S), fish oil (F), Schizochytrium microalga oil (A), and 20% of beef tallow (T; four groups), respectively. The T-groups were fed for another 7 weeks T-, SF-, F- and A-diet, respectively. At the end of both the first and the second 7-week fattening period, plasma lipid concentration and hepatic fatty acid content was determined. Both A and F diets fed for 7 weeks decreased (P &lt; 0.05) plasma TC (0.98 mmol∙l -1 ) compared to control (1.19 mmol∙l -1 ). The highest ( P &lt; 0.05) plasma TC was established in rats fed for 7 weeks the SF-diet following the previous 7-week T-treatment (2.15 mmol∙l -1 ). A-diet had the most positive (decreasing) effect on TAG concentrations (0.68–0.86 mmol∙l -1 compared to 1.22 and 2.88 mmol∙l -1 found in the C and T diets, respectively; P &lt; 0.05). Both plasma TC and TAG were in a negative relationship ( P &lt; 0.01) with the hepatic eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) contents, respectively. It was concluded that dietary Schizochytrium microalga oil (with high DHA content) may have the potential for decreasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases.",

The study was performed as a prospective, randomized, “double blind” clinical study. A total of 45 client-owned dogs scheduled for periodontal treatment were included. Dogs of Group C received carprofen (4 mg·kg -1 ), dogs of Group B received bupivacaine (1 mg·kg -1 ) and dogs of Group CB received a combination of carprofen (4 mg·kg -1 ) and bupivacaine (1 mg·kg -1 ). Carprofen was administered subcutaneously 30 min before anaesthesia, bupivacaine was administered by nerve blocks in anaesthetized dogs. Painful periodontal treatment was performed in all patients, lasting up to one hour. Modified University of Melbourne Pain Score (UMPS), Visual Analogue Scale for pain assessment (VAS), plasma glucose and serum cortisol levels were assessed 30 min before administration of analgesics (C-0, B-0, CB‑0) and 2 h after recovery from anaesthesia (C-2, B-2, CB-2). For statistical analysis Friedman test, Mann-Whitney U-test, ANOVA and Fischer exact tests were used ( P &lt; 0.05). In CB‑2 compared to CB‑0 significantly decreased modified UMPS values. In CB‑2 UMPS values were significantly lower compared to C‑2 or B‑2. In C‑2 VAS values were significantly increased compared to C‑0, and in B‑2 VAS values were significantly increased compared to B‑0. Visual Analogue Scale values were significantly lower in CB‑2 compared to C‑2 or B‑2. Significantly increased plasma glucose concentrations were found in C‑2 compared to C‑0 and in B‑2 compared to B‑0. No other significant differences were detected. Administration of carprofen, bupivacaine or their combination is sufficient for early postoperative analgesia following periodontal treatment. Carprofen-bupivacaine combination is superior to carprofen or bupivacaine administered separately.",

Thoracic and abdominal radiography, ultrasonography, and positive contrast cheliography of all animals were performed. Eight cases were considered as acute and six cases were considered chronic. The contrast images taken immediately after the injection of contrast material revealed the contrast material in the thoracic cavity in 8/8 acute trauma patients, but in none of the chronic cases. In 5/6 of these cases contrast material was seen in the thoracal cavity only in additional images taken after 5 min. One patient was diagnosed with FIP and excluded from the study. Twelve cases had complete resolution and one animal died during the early postoperative period. Our results suggest that positive contrast cheliography performed immediately after the injection of contrast material may not reveal chronic cases of diaphragmatic hernia and a second imaging (or imaging after 5 min) is indicated in order not to overlook chronic cases.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogen breath test is a non-invasive and inexpensive method for estimation of small bowel transit time, detection of excess bacteria in the small intestine and demonstration of maldigestion or malabsorption. Until now, little has been known about breath hydrogen excretion in lambs. The aim of our study was to assess the patterns of breath hydrogen excretion in lambs before and after feeding ewe’s milk, and to evaluate pathological and/or physiological alterations in the lambs’ gastrointestinal function. We assumed that intestinal disorders may influence the breath hydrogen concentrations, which could be detected early in the subclinical stage. A total of 52 healthy black-headed Dorper lambs were included in the study. Breath hydrogen was measured after overnight fasting and at 30, 60 and 90 min after the start of feeding. There was a 2-week follow-up period after the measurements to assess the gastrointestinal health of lambs. During the follow-up period, clinical signs of diarrhoea developed in 6 lambs. Based on our results in healthy lambs, the median concentration of baseline breath hydrogen was 1.00 parts per million (minimum: 0.00, maximum: 2.00). We observed a significant elevation in breath hydrogen concentrations 60 min after feeding ( P = 0.004), whereas the values detected 30 min after feeding were similar to the baseline values. Regarding the lambs in which clinical signs of diarrhoea developed, we revealed significantly higher baseline breath hydrogen concentrations compared to those which remained healthy ( P &lt; 0.001). Our observations underline that hydrogen breath test may be a useful tool for indicating potential bacterial overgrowth before any clinical signs of diarrhoea.",

In goat kids, neonatal mortality and morbidity seems to be relatively higher than in other farm species. This high mortality and morbidity in goat kids may be associated with underdeveloped metabolism and immune system during the first week of life. The main objectives of this study were to determine amylin concentration and its relationship with some hormones, biochemical indicators and with a general inflammatory marker, CRP (C-reactive protein) in goat neonates. Blood samples were collected from 30 Saanen goat neonates at 20–35 days of age. Plasma amylin and other hormone concentrations were measured by ELISA, whereas serum biochemical indices were analysed by spectrophotometry. The mean values of plasma amylin concentrations were 9.07 ± 0.25 pmol/l. Plasma amylin concentrations were positively correlated with plasma non-esterified fatty acids, CRP, prolactin, cortisol, insulin; however, a negative correlation was determined between plasma amylin and serum triglyceride concentrations. The current study suggests that amylin contents are strongly associated with circulating concentrations of some hormones and with those of CRP in Saanen goat kids.",

The animals were divided into two groups. The first clinical group consisted of 7 animals with confirmed mastitis. The second control group consisted of 7 mastitis-free animals. Mastitis was confirmed by clinical examination, California Mastitis Test, and bacteriological examination of the milk. The recording of spontaneous myoelectrical activity of the udder was followed by the registration of the voltage of the electrical current passed through the udder using EMS (electrical muscle stimulator). An increase of 540% in the amplitude of spontaneous spike potentials recorded in the mastitis-changed udder compared to the healthy udder was noted. Simultaneously, a decrease of 54% in the voltage of current generated by the electrical muscle stimulator passed through the mastitis-changed udder compared to the healthy udder was observed. The method of diagnosing mastitis in dairy cows shown in this study can be an alternative to California Mastitis Test because of its simplicity, velocity and inexpensiveness.",

A five-month-old Rasa Aragonesa male lamb was received at the Ovine Clinical Service of the Veterinary Faculty of Zaragoza, Spain, with a history of cervical protuberances coming from birth. The lamb showed three round swollen lumps (5–12 cm in diameter) parallel to the trachea on the left side of the neck. Clinical examination, haematology, ultrasonography, fluid examination and histopathology were performed. No abnormalities were found in blood samples and ultrasound confirmed a multicystic lesion with internal separations. Histological evaluation of the tissue revealed dilated lymphatic vessels and channels in the dermis and hypodermis; some lymphatic vessels were filled with amorphous proteinaceous material and occasional lymphocytes and macrophages. These protuberances were diagnosed as congenital lymphatic malformations. Most of the gross and microscopical lesions were very similar to those described in humans. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first time that a congenital lymphatic malformation is described in sheep.",

Two hundred and sixty in-calf, second and third parity cows were selected into pairs on basis of age, parity, milk production in previous lactation, days in milk and body condition score with the greatest possible conformity within pairs. Cow pairs were assigned into a 2-period crossover experiment (2 × 45 days) and kept in separate groups within the same shed. Dietary treatments were TMR with crimped corn preserved with either organic acids (treatment K) or microbial inoculant (treatment B). Ten superbly matched cow-pairs were selected to form nucleus pairs for metabolic studies. The preservatives had no effect on the nutrient content of crimped corn. Crimped corn preserved with the microbial inoculant were found mouldy, predominantly with Mucor sp. at a number high enough to inhibit the growth of lactic acid bacteria, and had significantly higher pH and ammonium concentration compared to the chemical treatment. The milk yield of treatment K cows was significantly higher than that of treatment B cows with identical feed intake. Blood beta-hydroxy-butyrate concentration was lower and blood aspartate amino transferase activity higher with treatment K compared to treatment B. Results of this study suggest the superiority of total mixed rations containing chemically preserved crimped corn in terms of ammonia and microbiological indicators of crimped corn, significantly higher milk yield, and balanced energy metabolism.",

We developed an active bone tissue substitute using nanofiber technology for a polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffold with the addition of hydroxyapatite and the colonisation of both components with hMSC with the ability of differentiation towards osteocytes. The constructed composition included the components necessary for bone healing (inorganic and cellular) and it also forms a spatially-oriented 3D structure. We used polycaprolactone Mw 70,000 with electrostatic spinning for the formation of nanofibers using a modified Nanospider TM method. For the inorganic component we used orthophosphate-calcium silicate with a crystal size of 1-2 mm which the nanofiber membrane was coated with. Both components were connected together with a tissue adhesive based of fibrin glue. Cultivated hMSC cells at a concentration of 1.2 × 10 4 /cm 2 were multiplied in vitro and then cultivated in the expansion medium. HMSC overgrew both the PCL membrane and the Si-CaP crystals. After colonisation with cultivated cells, this composite 3D structure can serve as a three-dimensional bone tissue replacement.",

The gene fragment coding glycoprotein D of canine herpesvirus 1 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, cloned into plasmid vector and expressed in Escherichia coli cells. Recombinant protein was then purified and used as an antigen in immunoblot for a detection of canine herpesvirus 1 specific antibodies. Antibody testing was performed on the panel of 100 canine sera by immunoblot with recombinant glycoprotein D as antigen and compared with indirect immunofluorescence assay. Serum samples were collected from 83 dogs with no history of canine herpesvirus 1 or reproductive disorders, and from 17 dogs from breeding kennels with a history of canine herpesvirus 1 related reproductive disorders. Sensitivity of glycoprotein D based immunoblot was 89.2% and specificity was 93%. Kappa value was calculated to be 0.8 between immunoblot and indirect immunofluorescence assay. Antibodies against canine herpesvirus 1 infection were detected in 33% of samples by immunoblot assay. Our study confirms that recombinant glycoprotein D expressed in bacterial cells could be used as a suitable and sensitive antigen for immunological tests and that herpesvirus infection seems to be common among the canine population in the Czech Republic.",

Another goal was to compare the efficacy and safety of sodium selenite and selenopyran as selenium sources for parenteral administration to piglets. Altogether 30 piglets were divided equally into three groups. Piglets in group 1 were injected i.m. with sodium selenite, piglets in group 2 were injected with selenopyran. The dose was 0.42 mg Se/kg body weight for both groups. Piglets in group 3 were given only saline. As expected, the study revealed low Se serum concentrations in weaned piglets. The injection of sodium selenite increased Se serum concentrations but did not have a positive effect on the peroxidase activities. Administration of selenopyran did not influence Se concentrations and gluthation peroxidase activities. The selected dose did not have a significant impact on the level of the oxidative stress. The piglets receiving Se only from the feed achieved comparable gluthation peroxidase activities during the trial. It seems that despite initially low Se concentrations, the physiological requirements for gluthation peroxidase synthesis were met with the feed consumption as the only Se source. The results of the study are important because until now it was unclear whether the selected dose would have negative effects on the organism with respect to the induction of oxidative stress in piglets.",

    "abstract": "Venison is becoming more and more interesting for consumers. Although treatment procedures of hunted game differ from slaughtered livestock, the hygienic quality of game meat must still be ensured. Potential indicators of meat hygienic quality include the content of biogenic amines. The aim of the present study was to assess the content and changes of biogenic amines in the muscles of selected kinds of small game (common pheasant and brown hare) during storage, and based on the obtained results, to assess the hygienic quality of the meat. Biogenic amines (putrescine, cadaverine, histamine, tyramine, phenylethylamine, and tryptamine) in the breast and thigh muscles separated by reverse phase liquid chromatography and consequently were detected using tandem mass spectrometry. Based on the determined content of biogenic amines, both pheasant and hare meats complied with values of high quality meat. The sum of biogenic amines did not exceed the value of 5 mg/kg after 7 days at 0 °C or 7 °C in pheasant meat, and after 21 days at 0 °C or after 14 days at 7 °C in brown hare meat. The biogenic amine content and the speed of their formation in venison can be very helpful for the evaluation of both meat hygienic quality and safety of these foods during storage.",

    "abstract": "Brook trout ( Salvelinus fontinalis ) is a species of fish native to North-East America. Brook trout are also commercially raised in large numbers for food production. Skin infection and/or parasite outbreaks can have a serious economics effect on aquaculture businesses. For this reason, it has been hybridized with the more resistant Arctic char ( Salvelinus alpinus ). The aim of this study was an examination of the epidermal structure and dynamic in brook trout and its Arctic char hybrid which is less sensitive to skin infection. The samples of fish (72 brook trout, 72 brook trout × Arctic char hybrid) from fish farm in Pravíkov (49°19’10”N, 15°5’40”E) were collected five times during the year 2011. Absolute and relative epidermal thickness (in relation to body size) and relative proportion of secretory cells in a given volume of epidermis were measured. The epidermis structure of brook trout and brook trout × Arctic char hybrid both display similar seasonal dynamics, with a decrease in absolute and relative epidermal thickness and a reduction in the relative percentage of mucous secretory cells over the summer. On the other hand, the lower absolute (mean 103 µm (range 84–146 µm) in brook trout; 88 µm (range 68–115 µm) in hybrids) and relative epidermal thickness (mean 4.8 (range 3.6–6.8) in brook trout; 4.4 (range 2.9–6.4) in hybrids) and lower volume of secretory cells was observed to the hybrid (mean 28% (range 19–33%) in brook trout; 23% (range 10–30%) in hybrids). It can interrelate with their higher resistance to infection and/or parasite outbreaks.",

A printed sample and a non-printed sample were taken from each of the packaging films analysed, the sample area being 1 dm 2 , to determine whether or not there is increased presence of phthalates in printed packaging films compared to non-printed packaging films, and to assess possible risks arising from their use. The determination of DBP and DEHP was conducted using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with the Zorbax Eclipse C8 column and UV detection at a wavelength of 224 nm. Concentrations of phthalates ranged from 2.18 to 81.33 µg∙dm -2 in printed samples and from 2.25 to 69.88 µg∙dm -2 in those without printing. This study shows different contents of phthalates in printed and non-printed areas of packaging films. The printed area had in most cases a higher content of phthalates probably due to the content of the substances in the printing colours.",

    "abstract": "Sudden deaths of finishing pigs in modern pig herds cause economic losses and therefore draw constant attention worldwide. In the case of peracute mortality associated with gastrointestinal bleeding, pigs usually die during a short period without clinical manifestations. Necropsy can detect bleeding into various parts of the digestive system. Determining the exact aetiology of the sudden death can be difficult in many cases. Diseases and conditions such as gastric ulcers, abdominal torsion, haemorrhagic bowel syndrome and infectious diseases should be taken into account in the differential diagnosis. Because some of these diseases still have an unclear aetiology and pathogenesis, the aim of our work was to provide a summary of existing knowledge as well as to describe related pathognomonic pathological changes.",

    "abstract": "The main goal of this study was to assess the progress of vertebral stability after lumbar interbody fusion related to microcomputed tomography (micro CT), biomechanical analysis, and histological assessment towards spine fusion. Twelve male pigs were used; each underwent L2-3 discectomy and implantation of an iliac crest bone graft in two groups; six spines were harvested eight weeks (A1) and six spines 16 weeks (A2) after surgery (7 native spines for biomechanical analysis). The CT was performed by GE phoenix datos|x 2.0 with a sample drift correction. The samples were divided according to fusion quality. Biomechanical evaluation was carried out on the MTS Mini Bionix testing system. In the nondestructive mode, three cycles of pure bending moments were applied (5 Nm load limit) at a rate of 20 °/min in flexion (+40 °) and extension (-40 °). Two representative histological sections from four samples were obtained (A1, n = 2; A2, n = 2); areas of mature bone were quantified. In micro CT, better results were achieved in group A2 (not significant). Eight weeks after the operation, flexural stiffness decreased to 48% of its initial value for native cadavers ( P &lt; 0.05); after 16 weeks it was comparable to native cadavers, demonstrating the suitability of the implanted graft ( P &lt; 0.05). The newly formed bone tissue occupied an average area of 94.205 mm 2 (A1) and 26.240 mm 2 (A2). It was confirmed that micro CT, biomechanical analysis, and histological assessment are technically feasible and suitable for the evaluation of results of other methods of large bone defect treatment.",

These cells showed considerable cellular pleomorphism. The protein markers CD3 and CD20 and paired box 5 (PAX5) transcription factor were traced immunohistochemically. Immunophenotypization using PAX5 showed nuclear positivity of this marker, but CD3 and CD20 (not interspecies cross-reactivity for guinea pig) demonstrated no positive reaction in the tumour cells. CD3-positive cells were found only in guinea pig tissue sections used as control. PAX5 in guinea pigs appears as a beneficial and preferred marker for B-cell derived tumours.",

    "abstract": "Cattle are among the most important farm animals that underwent an intense selection with the aim to increase milk production and to improve growth and meat properties, meanwhile reducing the generation interval allowing for a faster herd turnover. Recently, a shift from traditional breeding methods to breeding based on genetic testing has been observed. In this perspective, we review the techniques of molecular biology, genetics, and bioinformatics that are expected to further boost the agricultural potential of cattle. We discuss embryo selection based on next-generation and Nanopore sequencing and in vitro embryo production, boosting the potential of genetically superior animals. Gene editing of embryos could further speed up the selection process, essentially introducing a change in a single generation. Lastly, we discuss the host-microbiome co-evolution and adaptation. For example, cattle already adapted to low-quality low-cost fodder could be bred to achieve desired properties for the beef and dairy industry. The challenge of breeding and genetic editing is to accompany the selection on desired consumer-oriented traits with the push for sustainability and the adaptation to a changing climate while remaining economically viable. We propose that we are yet to see the limits of what is possible to achieve with modern technology for the cattle of the future; the ultimate goal will be to produce and maintain genetically elite individuals that can sustain the growing demands on the production.",

Ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen revealed a pregnant uterus and ultrasonography of the inguinal mass showed an organ with a lumen filled with anaechoic fluid. The diagnosis of a herniation was made and the owners decided for complete ovariohysterectomy. The left uterine horn had an incarcerated part of the inguinal hernia together with the ovary. Inside there was one macerated conceptus. The remaining part of the left uterine horn was located in the abdomen and had 2 macerated conceptuses.

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the morphological patterns of the genital tract after long-term treatment of deslorelin acetate in a female cat, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist currently used in adult cats to obtain transient oestrus suppression. A 1-year-old Chartreux female cat was treated with 4.7 mg deslorelin acetate to suppress oestrus manifestations. The treatment was repeated for a total of × 3 every 2 years. After 8 years, the female cat came into oestrus again, but she was no more implanted, and an ovariohysterectomy was performed. Before surgery, an ultrasound examination was performed that showed a normal uterus and the presence of about 5 follicles in ovaries. Concentrations of oestradiol, progesterone, and vaginal smears were compatible with oestrus. During surgery, a very short ovarian pedicle was observed yet neither uterus nor ovaries presented appreciable alterations. At histology, the ovaries presented a juvenile appearance with numerous primordial and periovulatory follicles. The uterus showed marked endometrial hyperplasia with polypoid projection and atrophic myometrium. Based on this case report, deslorelin acetate is a powerful drug able to preserve ovarian function. However, the suppression of gonadotrophin, especially for a long period, has a detrimental atrophic effect on the target organs during treatment and, on the opposite, hyperplastic changes may occur after the restoring of normal cyclicity.",

In total, 628 dairy cows were examined in the pre-parturient period (days in milk [DIM]: -21 to -1 day; n = 117), in the calving and maternity period (DIM: 0 to 7; n = 137), in the early lactation period (DIM: 8 to 30; n = 139), and the in the peak lactation (DIM: 31 to 150; n = 235). The dROMs and OSI values were significantly different (P &lt; 0.05) when comparing the 1st and 2nd+ lactation cows in each group. The highest mean value of dROMs was detected at the calving and maternity stage in 1st lactation cows (141 ± 25 U. Carr) and the lowest (103 ± 29 U. Carr) was found in peak lactation. The OSI developed similarly, with the highest value of 5.58 ± 0.94 in the calving and maternity period in the 1st lactation cows and the lowest value of 4.05 ± 1.21 in peak lactation and significant differences were found in many cases. Based on the results, the measurement of dROMs and OSI may be suitable for detecting oxidative stress in different lactation stages.",

Our results showed that the frequency of abnormalities was higher in exotic species of the Bovidae family compared to domestic species. Furthermore, the acquired defects prevailed over developmental abnormalities. Cytoplasmic droplets are a characteristic feature of epididymal sperm. Their average prevalence in the whole Bovidae family is almost 30%. However, distal droplets are not considered to be sperm pathology and, therefore, they are not the most frequent defect. The most common abnormalities are acquired head defects, followed by acquired tail defects, and then by acquired neck defects, mainly represented by proximal cytoplasmic droplets. The lowest prevalence was found for developmental abnormalities, with heads being more often affected than tails. The remaining defects were sporadic.",

After delivery, the offspring was not exposed to EMR. Samples of the liver of 5-week-old offspring were subjected to histopathological evaluation. They were processed for light and transmission electron microscopy. Our results indicated that EMR did not cause pronounced changes in the structure of the liver of the investigated offspring. The size and shape of liver lobuli was preserved and the amount of connective tissue in the liver parenchyma did not increase. However, electron microscopy revealed changes in the shape and number of microvilli at the vascular pole of hepatocytes, and formation of vesicles of various shapes and sizes. The endothelial cells were swollen with larger fenestrations compared to the control group. The spaces of Disse were irregular and dilated. Even though these changes were only mild, further studies are needed to determine the effect of EMR and clarify its potential risk during pregnancy.",

A two-week-old foal was presented with the right hind limb showing a 90-degree torsion of the tarsal region towards the medial side and the metatarsophalangeal joint forced in a 90-degree extension behind the right tarsus. As assessed through radiography, the tibial malleoli and the trochlea of the talus were poorly developed, the flexor tendons inserted topographically correctly on the phalanges but due to articular torsion, the tenaculum of long and lateral digital extensor tendons were projected laterally and the common digital extensor tendon on the medioplantar aspect. At the age of one month, a corrective ostectomy of the tibial malleoli, trochlear ridge, and talus was performed to reposition the adjacent bones. The tarsal bones were repositioned through an arthrotomy and subsequently the tarsal region fused by means of two cortex screws inserted in a lag fashion. Complete correction of the torsion was achieved through metatarsal osteotomy. A 20-hole 3.5-mm reconstruction plate was used for stabilization of the tibia and metatarsus, resulting in a pantarsal arthrodesis. Partial tibia shortening was performed to improve angulation of the tarsal region. At nine months after surgery, the pony was keeping the right limb hoof sole on the ground.",

These wastes should be directed to a destination that does not promote any risk to the environment and above all, according with the laws regulating waste disposal. So, the wastes are transformed into byproducts for utilization in the animal nutrition, poultry and swine feeding, but cannot use for ruminant feed, only non-ruminant feeding. In Brazil, the first scientific studies on the use of by-products of poultry slaughter as a protein source in diets for broiler chickens were started in the 1960's, and these results were used for a long time for food formulation, but the need to improve the herds stimulated the search for improvement in technologies for more accurate diet formulations.

    "abstract": "Honey is globally an important food and the concern regarding its conservation is increasing. Irradiation is an interesting alternative process of food conservation known to efficiently improve the quality and extend the durability of many products. The purpose of this work was to investigate the physical and chemical effects of the treatment of honey produced by Apis mellifera with a gamma radiation dose of 10 kGy. No significant change was found in the irradiated samples for the levels of humidity, acidity, fixed mineral residue (ashes), reducing glucids, non-reducing glucids (apparent saccharosis) and insoluble ashes, as well as in the results from Lund`s and Fiehe`s tests. Thus, it can be concluded that irradiation at 10 kGy does not significantly affect the physicochemical characteristics of honey produced by Apis mellifera.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Honey, Apis mellifera, irradiation, physicochemical properties.",

Dentre as moleculas de adesao, quatro grandes familias se destacam: as integrinas, imunoglobulinas, selectinas e caderinas. Essas moleculas coordenam as varias fases da adesao leucocitaria ao endotelio, promovendo rapida regulacao de interacoes adesivas entre as celulas sanguineas e o endotelio.

Muitas substâncias e farmacos alteram a adesao leucocitaria, como: anticoagulantes, corticoides e anti-inflamatorios nao-esteroidais. Enfermidades que acometem os animais podem ser relacionadas a adesao leucocitaria de duas formas: doencas que suscitem processo inflamatorio que levem a migracao de leucocitos (como doencas infecciosas e neoplasias) ou por um restrito grupo de doencas que inibem a adesao leucocitaria. Alguns testes in vitro para avaliar a capacidade migratoria dos leucocitos podem ser realizados, tais como os testes de quimiotaxia, de analise de mutacoes pontuais em moleculas de adesao, imunohistoquimica dentre outros. No entanto, algumas enfermidades que alteram a adesao leucocitaria sao pouco frequentes, e, assim, podem ser negligenciadas na clinica veterinaria. A despeito da pouca literatura disponivel, o estudo da adesao leucocitaria e de extrema relevância na clinica medica veterinaria. Desta forma, a presente revisao aborda desde os aspectos mais fundamentais acerca da etiologia, diagnostico e fatores que interferem na homeostase dos mecanismos da adesao leucocitaria.",

Fourteen adult male Wistar rats were divided into two groups. Langendorff hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit solution at constant pressure (85 mmHg) and 37 °C (CaCl 2 , 1.2 mM). The electrogram was recorded by touch-free method. The hearts of the first group were exposed to 3.10 -5 M perphenazine, the hearts of the second group to 3.10 -8 M perphenazine. The incidence of arrhythmias and the heart rate and QT interval changes were studied on electrogram during 30 min periods of control, the first perphenazine administration, washout, and the second drug administration. Perphenazine administration significantly prolonged QT ( p &lt; 0.001) and QTc ( p &lt; 0.05) in group 1. In group 2, QT and QTc prolongation was less pronounced ( p &lt; 0. 05). A number of arrhythmias appeared, from single premature ventricular complexes to more severe ones in both groups. The heart rate changes were non-significant. We conclude that although phenothiazines are still medicaments of choice in certain psychoses, their cardiovascular side effects should be always taken in consideration.",

The freezing point was determined in 42 bulk tank raw sheep milk samples and 42 pasteurized milk samples collected during lactation of sheep at one ecofarm in Moravian Walachia (Valašsko in the Czech Republic). The freezing point was determined in accordance with the standard ČSN 57 0538 using a thermistor cryoscope. The average freezing point of raw milk was -0.617 ± 0.052 °C, with a range from -0.560 to -0.875 °C. The freezing point was lower in the first months of lactation and increased at the end of lactation. The freezing point correlated (r = 0.8967) with the content of total non-fat solids. The average freezing point of sheep milk pasteurized at 65 °C for 30 min was -0.614 ± 0.053 °C, with a range from -0.564 to -0.702 °C.

A total of 68 Wistar albino rats ( Rattus norvegicus v. alba f. domestica ) aged 3–4 weeks were divided into four groups. In group 1 (n = 22) pinealectomy was performed, in group 2 (n = 24) the sensorymotor cortical area 2 × 1 × 1 mm below the coronal suture was removed. Sham operation consisted of a craniotomy (n = 11) and a craniotomy with a durotomy (n = 11). All surgeries were performed from the left side. The rats were killed four months after surgery and radiography was then made. Scoliosis, C2-T7 lordosis and T7-S1 kyphosis were measured.The brains of rats after sensorimotor cortical area removal were isolated and investigated including histological examination (light microscope). Scoliosis of 9–14 degrees (mean value 10.8) was developed in five animals after pinealectomy; in rats after removal of the sensorimotor cortical area scoliosis of 10–24 degrees (mean value 15.9) was observed in eight animals. The scoliotic curves were non structural. Our results indicate the importance of cortical area damage, together with craniotomy and durotomy in the development of growing rat spine. These damages could cause a disorder of balance between smaller inhibitory and greater facilitating area of central nervous system, controlling the muscular tone and resulting in the development of increased lordosis and kyphosis and non structural scoliosis due to muscle imbalance. Thus the new hypothesis of scoliosis aetiology was introduced.",

    "abstract": "Leptin, the product of the ob gene, is secreted mainly in adipose tissue. Due to the associations between plasma leptin concentrations and body fat, leptin could be used as an indicator for the in vivo evaluation of carcass composition in breeding programs. Previous studies showed relation between leptin concentrations and some trace elements, suggesting that they might be mediators of leptin production. The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of single nucleotide polymorphism of the leptin gene on concentration of trace elements in the serum of 58 Czech Pied bulls. Three experimental groups of bulls were formed depending on different leptin genotypes: group CC (n = 28), group CT (n = 21) and group TT (n = 9). In all groups, the age (at a mean age of 240 days) and the body weight (mean 291 ± 11 kg) difference among the chosen animals was non-significant. Blood samples of all bulls in experimental groups were collected from vena jugularis externa between 8.00 and 9.30 h. Concentrations of copper, zinc and iron in the serum of animals were measured. Significantly lower ( P &lt; 0.05) zinc concentrations were recorded in bulls of TT group (13.21 ± 1.81 µmol·l -1 ) compared to CC (20.09 ± 1.11 µmol·l -1 ) and CT group (19.67 ± 1.45 µmol·l -1 ). In case of copper and iron concentrations in serum of animals, no differences were recorded between the tested groups. This is the first study of its kind in Czech Pied cattle. Based on our results, we may assume that zinc plays some role in the metabolism of adipose tissue, havings an effect on beef quality.",

The aim of this study was to monitor biogenic amine concentrations in the muscle tissues of pheasants (n = 20) killed by pithing and treated by drawing (guts are removed from the body cavity through the cloaca using a specially fashioned hook). The pheasants’ bodies were stored hanged by the neck for 21 days at ±7 °C. Breast and thigh muscle samples were collected at weekly intervals (day 1, 7, 14 and 21 of storage). Biogenic amines (putrescine, cadaverine, tyramine, histamine, tryptamine and phenylethylamine) were analysed by reverse phase liquid chromatography and detected by tandem mass spectrometry. In breast muscle, the most evident change was noted in the concentration of cadaverine (0.026 and 1.070 mg/kg for storage day 1 and 21, respectively) and tyramine (0.001 and 0.958 mg/kg for storage day 1 and 21, respectively). Throughout the storage period, the concentration of 5 mg/kg (indicating a loss of high hygienic quality of meat) was not exceeded by any of the assessed biogenic amines. In thigh muscle, the concentration indicating high hygienic quality of meat was exceed after 14 days of storage in the case of cadaverine, tyramine and putrescine (at the end of storage their concentrations were 9.058, 10.708 and 3.345 mg/kg, respectively). Hygienic quality of thigh muscle decreased faster compared to breast muscle. This study brings new information about the content of biogenic amines in the meat of pithed pheasants treated by drawing.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to develop a diet which causes stable hyperglycaemia and development of diabetes in female Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. We also examined whether worsened wound healing is caused only by hyperglycaemia or whether it is caused by more factors. Four types of special diets with a different content of fat were fed to eight groups of 3–7 ( fa/fa or fa/+ ) rats. The following diets were used: H1 (24.6% fat), H2 (33.2%), C13004 (25.6%), and St1 (3.4%). We detected significant diet-dependent changes of weight and concentration of glucose in animals with leptin mutation ( fa/fa ). All examined indicators were significantly ( P &lt; 0.001) higher in ( fa/fa ) animals compared to the fa/+ ones no matter what diet they ate. All diets with high-fat content caused increased glycaemia, but only the diet with 24.6% fat caused a significant ( P &lt; 0.01) increase of glycaemia. Our results have proved that this diet is the most suitable to invoke and keep hyperglycaemia. The diet with 25.6% fat is suitable to invoke stable slightly increased glycaemia (10 mmol/l) and hyperinsulinaemia. On the other hand, the diet with 33.2% fat is unsuitable. We did not observe a significant influence of diet on wound healing. We developed a new diet more suitable for induction of stable hyperglycaemia in female ZDF rats than commercially available mixtures. Our study is the first to present recommendations for adjusting a high-fat diet to produce stable hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia in the rat model.",

    "abstract": "Stryphnodendron fissuratum Mart. (Fabaceae) is an importantly toxic plant for livestock in Central-Western Brazil. Despite the recently published clinical descriptions of the poisoning, the gross and histopathological lesions of the disease needed to be better characterized. For this reason the pods of S. fissuratum were given orally to 10 young goats. The goats that received single doses of 10 g/kg, 20 g/kg and 40 g/kg and 4 fractioned doses of 5 g/kg, died poisoned. One goat that received a single dose of 10 g/kg recovered. Only those animals that received one dose of 5 g/kg did not become ill. At post mortem examination, the main lesions were associated with the digestive system and consisted of broken up epithelium and congestion of the mucosa of forestomachs and abomasum. Widespread areas of erosion and ulcerations were observed at the reticula and abomasal mucosa. Int these areas, the main lesions were neutrophil infiltration, vacuolization of the epithelial lining, swelling and dissociation of cells with cytoplasmic eosinophilia, pyknosis, karyorrhexis and nuclear karyolysis. In the central nervous system, the main lesions were identified in the brain of goats that received 20 g/kg and 40 g/kg of pods and consisted of spongiosis of the brainstem white matter. Based on these results, it was proved that the pods of S. fissuratum are acutely toxic for goats under the conditions of this experiment. The poisoning was characterized by damage to the organs of the digestive system and the central nervous system.",

A tecnica de Moore apresentou um bom resultado, e em casos de presenca de entropio bilateral podem ser realizadas ambas as cirurgias no mesmo dia, desde que o entropio nao seja do tipo espastico. O procedimento cirurgico usando a tecnica de Moore continua sendo a tecnica cirurgica de facil aprendizado, mais simples de se realizar e nao afetou a mobilidade da terceira palpebra.",

The morfometric characteristics were studied through a transversal incision of the main structures of the metacapophalangeal joints of 16 right side thoracic members and 14 left side thoracic members of adult horses of no defined breeding, seeking to generate a form of predictable quality. Measurements were taken so as to obtain the width and thickness of the superficial and deep tendons of the digital flexor muscle, interdigital intersesamoid ligament, tendon of the common digital extensor muscle and palmar, back and side of the articular capsule. No differences were found between the superficial digital flexor muscle tendons, common and lateral digital extensor muscle tendons, interdigital intersesamoid ligament, neither in width or thickness, deep digital flexor muscle tendon, only in thickness and back portion of the articular capsule (P>0.05) independing of the antimere, however significant differences were found amongst the widths of the deep digital flexor muscle tendons (P>0.01), as well as in the palmar portion of the articular capsules (P>0.05).

    "abstract": "This study was aimed to compare the effect of fresh and frozen immune plasma of rabbits with acute infection in the prophylactic and curative control of Trypanosoma evansi-infected rats. Thirty adult rats and a rabbit were used. The rabbit was infected with 0.5ml of blood containing trypomastigotes. Showing the parasite in the bloodstream, plasma was obtained and divided in frozen and fresh plasma. Frozen plasma was stored in cryopreservation tubes and frozen. Fresh plasma was kept at 37°C for 30 minutes. The rats were separated into six equal groups, all infected intraperitoneally with 4.5 x 104 trypomastigotes of the T. evansi strain. Each rat from prophylatic (A and B) and curative(C and D) groups received 0.8ml of plasma. Animals from group E (control group) received only saline. Frozen plasma was administered in groups A and C and the fresh plasma in groups B and D. The effects of rabbits plasma with acute infection was estimated by evaluation of the prepatency period, longevity and curative effects of rats. No difference was observed in the prepatency period. The longevity of the animals treated prophylactically with fresh plasma (group B) was superior than the other groups. No curative effect was observed in the animals, but based upon the results it is concluded that the treatment with immune plasma of rabbits increases the longevity of T. evansi-infected rats.",

    "abstract": "Uncoupling protein-2, discovered in 1997, is the first described homologue of uncoupling protein-1. Uncoupling proteins increase the permeability of inner mitochondrial membrane for protons, decrease the efficiency of energy conversion, inhibit the ATP synthesis and stimulate energy release in form of heat. Uncoupling proteins also increase the substrate oxidation and reduce production of reactive oxygen species in mitochondria. The present study was conducted to assess the effects of acute treatment with triiodothyronine on uncoupling protein-2 mRNA levels in Wistar rats. Intraperitoneal injection of one dose of triiodothyronine (200 μg/kg rat body weight) increased mRNA expression of uncoupling protein-2 in liver tissue almost 2-fold after 12 h. Concentrations of total triiodothyronine and free triiodothyronine in serum were increased 122-fold and 76-fold, respectively. These results suggest that gene coding uncoupling protein-2 is gene inducible in the liver shortly after single administration of T 3 . Data about the kinetics of T 3 mediated induction of UCP-2 mRNA during the first 24 h after treatment were not available in literature so far and therefore constitute our priority findings.",

Together with sediment samples we also collected benthos, biofilm and juvenile fish. Concentration of lead was established in all the samples since the sewage waters discharged from the car battery production plant are heavily polluted with lead. Genotoxicity was tested with two tests of genotoxicity: the SOS chromotest and the Escherichia coli WP2 test. The toxicity of sediments was tested with a test of toxicity performed on a water crustacean Daphnia magna . A profound toxic influence upon benthic organisms was found; a consequence of the river pollution with waste water and flush water from the car battery production plant. This toxic effect was also proven by an aqueous leach from the test performed with Daphnia magna . Both tests of genotoxicity proved a significant genotoxic potential of the sediment samples linked with the growth of the concentration of lead in the sediments (up to 647 mg kg -1 ). The content of lead also increased in the biofilm (up to 3.37 mg kg -1 of dry mass) as well as in the fish bodies (up to 804.5 mg kg -1 of dry mass). This thesis is the first study of the load imposed on this river as a consequence of the waste water and flush water discharge from the motor industry production plant (car battery production).",

However, little is known about healing of the pancreatic parenchyma after radiofrequency ablation as it is important for the prevention of complications and treatment strategy. The aim of this experimental in vivo study on pigs was to evaluate the pancreatic parenchyma healing dynamics after damage by radiofrequency ablation. Radiofrequency ablations of the duodenal lobe of the pancreas were performed on 8 cross-bred laboratory pigs. They were euthanized in pairs at seven, fourteen, forty and eighty days after the procedure. Histological and cytological changes of the ablated zone were evaluated after autopsy. It was proved that pancreatic necrosis after radiofrequency ablation heals by means of fibrotic scar. There was no sign of exocrine and endocrine regeneration, respectively, during 80 days after the procedure. This is the first study verifying that the healing process of an ablation zone in the pancreatic parenchyma after radiofrequency ablation is similar to healing in the liver, lung, heart and other parenchymal organs.",

    "abstract": "Certain types of convulsions may lead to multiorgan dysfunction. We investigated whether the chemoconvulsant pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) could influence energy synthesis in the liver besides evoking convulsions in adult male Wistar rats. In 80% of the rats PTZ (100 mg/kg body weight, administered intraperitoneally – i.p.) evoked generalised clonic convulsions (GCCs) and in 60% of the rats generalised clonic-tonic convulsions (GCTCs) within 4 min after its administration. Cytochrome c oxidase activity was simultaneously reduced approximately three-fold compared to 0.9% NaCl-treated (control) rats ( p &lt; 0.01). Midazolam administered before PTZ was an excellent anti-convulsant especially against GCCs ( p &lt; 0.05). However, it did not protect against the decrease in cytochrome c oxidase activity induced by PTZ. In contrast to midazolam, pretreatment with L-arginine did not prevent PTZ-evoked convulsions. However, it offered some protection against the PTZ-mediated reduction in cytochrome c oxidase activity. Our results open new avenues of research that will focus on the mechanisms of action of PTZ, midazolam and L-arginine with particular reference to their direct and/or indirect effects on liver function.",

Possible toxic effects were evaluated using the test determining the inhibition of the growth of white mustard root Sinapis alba . Results of ecotoxicological assessment of sediment leachates showed that their quality varied significantly during the year. Differences were found between results of sediment evaluations from different collection profiles, which may indicate effects of point source pollution. Of the ecotoxicological tests used, the most sensitive organisms included the green algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata , bioluminiscent bacteria Vibrio fischeri and the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis . The highest concentrations of arsenic were found by chemical analysis in both spring and autumn sediment leachate samples collected at Site L1 (Leskava). The highest organic pollutant concentrations were found in autumn sediment leachate samples from Site L1. In total PAH sums, phenanthrene was the dominant pollutant at all the sites investigated.",

    "abstract": "Two newly synthesized short-acting agents 44Bu and 444 were observed to suppress the aconitine-induced arrhythmias and block the fast sodium current I Na in the rat heart. No data about their effect on the electrocardiographic parameters are available. In this study, we explored the effect of both racemates and particular isomers of 44Bu and 444 on the QRS-complex width in vivo in rats and on I Na in isolated rat ventricular myocytes. All variants of 44Bu and 444 (1.5 mg/kg) caused a significant QRS-widening reaching the peak effect at the 1st or 2nd min after their intravenous administration. 44Bu racemate widened the QRS-complex from 16.8 ± 0.4 to 26.3 ± 0.5 ms (by 57%), significantly more than R- (33%-widening) and S-isomer (36%-widening). 444 racemate widened the QRS-complex from 20.8 ± 1.0 to 34.1 ± 0.9 ms (by 64%), which was comparable to S-isomer (63%-widening), however, substantially more than R-isomer (40%-widening). Regarding the effect on I Na , 44Bu caused a significantly deeper I Na - block compared to 444 when applied at the same concentration of 3 μmol/l (~0.1 mg/kg). 44Bu racemate and R-isomer blocked I Na similarly (91.7 ± 0.8 and 91.8 ± 1.6%-block, respectively) and significantly more than S-isomer (82.4 ± 2.3%-block). 444 R-isomer blocked I Na less than racemate and S-isomer (by 31.7 ± 3.9% vs. 48.3 ± 4.7 and 50.2 ± 4.1%, respectively). We conclude that both racemates and particular isomers of 44Bu and 444 induce a QRS-widening and block I Na in the rat heart, however, their effects notably differed. The relative widening of the QRS-complex after application of 44Bu did not conform to the level of I Na -block observed in isolated cardiomyocytes which stresses the importance of in vivo experiments in the pre-clinical testing of new drugs.",

Specimens from the vasospastic vessel (group of specimens B) and from the flap border with no vasospasm (control group A) were taken 2 h after the stimulus initiation. Detection of ET-1 mRNA by Quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR was performed. β-actin was selected as an acceptable reference gene. Relative gene expression data were given as the n-fold change in transcription of target genes normalized to the endogenous control. Relative gene expressions and time indicators of vasospasm were compared in both groups. No significant difference of the ET-1 gene expressions was found between groups A and B ( p = 0.505). No correlation between the duration of vasospasm and ET-1 gene expression was found as well ( p = 0.299). In conclusion, the expression of the ET-1 gene in the mechanically induced vasospastic vessel of the pedicled flap was not significantly increased. In this study, the causality of the vasospasm pathogenesis and gene expression of ET-1 was not proven.",

The major causes of the immunosuppression are viruses that suppress transcription of interferon genes, especially interferon alpha. There is a need for monitoring immunosuppression in commercially bred chickens. For this purpose, the absolute abundance of interferon alpha transcripts can be measured in blood of chickens by a suitable assay. Such an assay was used to estimate abundance of chicken interferon alpha in a sample of splenic cells induced with polyinosinic polycytidylic acid. The abundance measured was 29 ± 2 attomoles/µg total RNA. This assay can be performed in microtitre plates using samples collected from chickens in poultry houses.",

A total of 34 domestic piglets of the Czech Black Pied (Přeštice) breed were used in the study. The animals (male to female ratio 8 : 9) were six weeks old and their average body mass was 22 kg. A general anaesthetic (fentanyl and azaperon) was introduced via a pulmonary artery catheter and the spontaneously breathing animals were monitored for 60 min. Cardiac output and haemodynamic indicators were established using intermittent pulmonary artery thermodilution. Blood gas data were deduced using fan dynamic parameters of ventilation and ventilation indices. The study yielded reliable data of dynamic lung indicators ( p &lt; 0.05); e.g. the tidal volume 6.00 ± 0.82 ml/kg, hypoxemic index 350.47 ± 42.50 mmHg, lung compliance 0.63 ± 0.12 ml/cmH 2 O/kg, and haemodynamic indicators ( p &lt; 0.01) such as cardiac output 2.12 ± 0.75 l/min, pulmonary vascular resistance 3.92 ± 0.52 and systemic vascular resistance 15.8 ± 6.81 Woods units. Reliable data regarding lung dynamics, cardiac output, preload and afterload of both heart ventricles in spontaneously breathing healthy piglets under general anaesthesia were achieved.",

The study was carried out in one commercial flock of laying hens in Opatovice in the Czech Republic in the years 2008-2010. A total of 280 samples of blood sera were taken from laying hens coming from four poultry houses. The sera were tested by the haemagglutination inhibition test according to the OIE Manual. Virological testing was conducted as a consequence of atypical results of serological testing. Newcastle disease virus RNA was proved by the RT-nested PCR method in the pooled tissue samples of 5 hens, in the samples of intestines with ileocaecal tonsila, in trachea and also in one swab sample from the environment of one house. Based on sequencing analysis and subsequent phylogenetic analysis, the virus was identified as a low pathogenic strain of paramyxovirus (PMV-1). This low pathogenic strain did not have any impact on the health of laying hens.",

Eighteen Murrah buffaloes with approximately 17 months of age and initial average weight of 300kg were observed for 9 days. They remained on pasture from 7 a.m. till 5 p.m. (observation period). In the evenings, animals were put in their individual stalls, and received the concentrate under 3 different treatments: Treatment 1 = 0.6%, Treatment 2 = 0.9% and Treatment 3 = 1.2% of the animal weight. The observed variables were: Grazing time (TP); Standing time (TEP); Lying time (TD); Rumination time (TR); Wallowing time (TCH); and Time in other activities (TOA). The effect of treatment was significant only for TEP and TD. The day influenced significantly (P <0.01) all variables, but there was no difference between days for the variables of weather and humidity temperature index (ITU). There was an interaction between day and treatment for variable rumination time (P <0.05), the treatment 2 was superior to the others on the fourth day of observation. The fourth day of observation showed significantly superior in comparison to the other days in all treatments. The levels of supplementation did not alter the activities of grazing, wallowing and time in other activities of buffaloes in semi-confined system.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Buffalos, ingestive behavior, semiconfined.",

The variables of composite materials were evaluated in 3 groups of animals, 2 animals in each, at different time intervals (1, 6 and 9 months after beginning of the experiment). In various time intervals, 12 teeth per group were extracted under general injection anaesthesia, 6 teeth from each animal). Altogether 36 teeth were extracted throughout the experiment. During the experiment we observed neither cracks nor marginal discoloration in both Filtek P60 and Opticor New restorations. Retention of all restorations was 100%. Significant ( P = 0.029 ANOVA) differences were observed in the dentin with Filtek P60 packable restorations which exhibited smaller marginal microgaps (OPTICOR NEW and dentin 11.09 mm, FILTEK P60 and dentin 5.64 μm). The mean size of microgaps between dentin and the packable composite material Filtek P60 was significantly lower (P = 0.029 ANOVA) in comparison with the microhybrid Opticor New composite restorations.

This report describes a case of a male pseudo-hermaphrodite in a pig, whose reproductive organs were collected in a slaughterhouse. The pig was 150 days old, weighed nearly 100 kg, and showed external genitalia compatible with a female. The organs were evaluated grossly and microscopically. Grossly, the vulva showed abnormal morphology, but the vagina and the uterus (cervix, body, and horns) showed normal topographic anatomy. The gonads were morphologically compatible with testes with epididymis and pampiniform plexuses present. Histological examination of the gonads confirmed the identification of testes showing degenerative changes. Based on the gross and microscopic findings, the animal was diagnosed as a male pseudo-hermaphrodite.",

Optimization of the alimentary efficiency in the drove have caused serious problems because of the inadequate feeding management. This procedure has a complicated result: the obstructive urolitiasis. Thus the aim of this work is to study bladder fistulization techniques as chirurgical treatment of this disease. It was used 10 male adult goats, clinically healthy. The animals were submitted previously to tranquillizer cloridrate of xylazine and anaesthetized with cloridrate of lydocaine 2 %. It was performed 5 centimeter incision in paramedian ventral region of the abdomen where bladder was localized and externalized. It was made an incision of approximately 1 centimeter and the whole bladder muscular layer was taken to make the fistula. These animals were observed during 15 days, in this period the micturition flow without difficulties. We concluded that bladder fistulization technique is an alternative to the obstructive urolitiasis treatment once no serious pos chirurgical complication is present and because of its simple execution.\r\n\r\nKey words: goat, surgery, bladder, urolitiasis.",

    "abstract": "The functional development of the small intestine was investigated in Japanese quail chicks subjected to simulated microgravity (hypodynamy) on the second day after hatching and reared under these conditions to 63 days of age. On days 5, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 56 and 63 the activity of brush-border-bound alkaline phosphatase (AP) in the duodenum and jejunum were determined in experimental animals as well as in control quail chicks housed in a floor box during these periods. As compared with control quails the experimental animals displayed a significantly increased enzyme activity until day 42 in the duodenum and day 35 in the jejunum ( P &lt; 0.001) whereas in older quails no significant enzymatic differences between these groups was found. However, a decrease in food consumption due to a partial physical constraint cannot be excluded. Moreover, the results suggested that the activity of AP in the control birds did not change substantially during all the periods examined. In contrast, in older hypodynamy quail the AP activity significantly decreased in the duodenum on days 56 and 63 and in the jejunum on days 42, 56 and 63, respectively. These results indicate that a) the enhanced intestinal function in early periods of life may reflect the higher sensitivity of small intestine to simulated weightlessness, b) the decrease of the AP activity in older animals to the level of controls might be considered as a part of intestinal mechanisms involved in adaptation of quail chicks to long-term hypodynamy, c) different activity of AP in the small intestine of Japanese quail may not have resulted only from hypodynamy but also due to decreased food intake.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this work was to find whether an adsorbent used as an additive in the feed mixtures could influence the concentration of free available zinc. The feed supplement ZeoFeed, which often constitutes a part of animal feed mixtures, mainly for poultry, was used as adsorbent in the amount of 10 g kg -1 of the feed mixture. A substantial part of ZeoFeed is clinoptilolite, a natural form of zeolite. Two sample preparation methods were used for the determination of zinc. The microwave-assisted wet digestion method was used to achieve a complete decomposition of the feed mixture in order to determine the total zinc concentration. The extraction method represented a simplified model of the processes in the digestive fluid tract. The extraction was done under laboratory temperature for 30, 60 and 120 min. Concentrations of zinc both in digests and extracts were determined by the method of the differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry. The total zinc concentration (mean ± 95% confidence interval) in the feed mixture without addition of clinoptilolite was found to be 145 ± 32.0 mg kg -1 and in the feed mixture with added clinoptilolite 146 ± 11.5 mg kg -1 . The concentrations of free available zinc were approximately ten times lesser than the total amount. The analysis of extracts showed that no statistically significant differences between concentrations of zinc in extracts without clinoptilolite and with clinoptilolite addition have been found. The extraction time did not affect the extracted amount of zinc significantly. In addition to zinc, also other three trace elements, namely the essential trace element copper and the toxic trace elements cadmium and lead, were measured. However, these data have only preliminary value and need further verification.",

    "abstract": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) have been associated with stroke prevention. This stroke prevention appears to occur apart from cholesterol lowering effects. A number of mechanisms have been postulated for this prevention. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of simvastatin on the c-fos gene activity and its relation to delayed neuronal death in CA1 region of hippocampus following transient forebrain ischemia in the adult rat hippocampus. A total of 17 male Wistar albino rats were used in this study. The animals were divided into three groups: 5 sham-operated animals; 6 ischemised rats without statin pre-treatment and 6 ischemised rats with statin pre-treatment. We used simvastatin at the dose of 20 mg/kg during 14 days prior to the ischemic attack. Fifteen min long transient forebrain ischemia was induced by the four-vessel occlusion. Two and a half h reperfusion was used for the c-Fos activity detection using immunostaining and 72 h reperfusion was used for the determination of neurons surviving using haematoxylin/eosin staining. The average neuronal density in the CA1 region of hippocampus in the sham-operated rats, in ischemised rats without pre-treatment and in ischemised rats with statin pre-treatment was 47.03 ± 3.09/0,025 mm 2 , 9.05 ± 2.46/0,025 mm 2 and 16.45 ± 2.78/025 mm 2 , respectively. A significant neuroprotective effect was observed in the pre-treated ischemic group ( P &lt; 0.001) in comparison to the ischemic group without pre-treatment. The average of c-Fos positive nuclei density in the CA1 region of hippocampus in the sham-operated rats, in ischemised rats without pre-treatment and in ischemised rats with statin pre-treatment was 0.266 ± 0.074/025 mm 2 , 28.2 ± 2.053/025 mm 2 , 30.3 ± 4.816/025 mm 2 , respectively. A highly significant difference in c-Fos positivity ( P &lt; 0.001) was found between the sham operated group and both ischemic groups (with and without pre-treatment). No significant difference in c-Fos positivity was observed between untreated ischemic and pre-treated ischemic groups ( P &gt; 0.05). These findings indicate that simvastatin provides protection against CA1 hypoxic neuronal injury, which is independent of c-fos activation. We can conclude that simvastatin neuroprotection may be mediated by multiple mechanisms as can be expected based on its pleiotropic effects.",

Furthermore, effects of an eight-week oral administration of the newly synthesized substances on serum cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, adiponectin, resistin and weight gain were studied in C57Bl/6J mice that were fed high energy diet. The newly synthesized substance A482 (4-(2-{[2-hydroxy-3-(4-methyl-carbamoylphenoxy) propyl]amino}ethyl)phenoxy-acetic acid hydrochloride) was able to produce almost full lipolysis at a 1 × 10 -7 M concentration, and its effect on the rat epididymal adipose tissue was similar to the specific β 3 -adrenergic agonist BRL37344. Ethyl ester of this substance significantly lowered plasma total cholesterol ( p &lt; 0.001), resistin ( p &lt; 0.01), weight gain ( p &lt; 0.01), improved total/HDL-cholesterol ratio ( p &lt; 0.01) and increased circulating adiponectin ( p &lt; 0.001) in C57Bl/6J mice that were fed high energy diet. The second tested substance B496 did not show all activities expected from β 3 -adrenergic agonists.

Therefore the myoelectric activity was continuously recorded before and after intravenous administration of 0.15 M NaCl or CCK peptides in adult rams, equipped with platinum bipolar electrodes in the abomasal antrum, duodenum, and jejunum. CCK octapeptide (CCK-OP) was given to five rams at doses of 17.5, 175, or 1750 pmol/ kg and cerulein was administered to six rams at doses of 0.735, 7.35, or 73.5 pmol/kg of body weight. Each dose was infused to fasted or non-fasted animals for 30, 60, 120, or 300 s during phase 1, 2a or 2b (the less or more intense) of the migrating myoelectric complex (MMC). The 300-sec infusion of the moderate CCK-OP dose during the less intense or more intense phase 2b of the MMC increased the antral slow-wave amplitude from 79 ± 7 to 124 ± 26 μV ( p &lt; 0.01) and from 82 ± 8 to 175 ± 40 μV ( p &lt; 0.001), respectively. The 300-sec infusion of the highest CCK-OP dose under the same conditions increased antral slow-wave amplitude from 79 ± 6 to 121 ± 24 μV ( p &lt; 0.05) and from 84 ± 9 to 138 ± 27 μV ( p &lt; 0.01), respectively. Administration of the moderate dose of CCK for 120 s in the course of the less or more intense phase 2b of the MMC increased antral slow-wave frequency from 6.1 ± 0.2 to 6.6 ± 0.4 cpm (N.S.) and from 6.1 ± 0.3 to 6.8 ± 0.4 cpm ( p &lt; 0.05), respectively.

    "abstract": "This study examined the influence of low, adequate and high dietary zinc intake on the growth and metabolic interactions between zinc, copper and iron in different Mongolian gerbil ( Meriones unguiculatus ) tissues. Animals were fed a basal diet (for 3 wk) containing a low-zinc level (8 mg/kg diet, LZ-group), adequate zinc level (25 mg/kg diet, AZ-group) and saturated zinc level (38 mg/kg diet, SZ-group). After comparing the body weight of gerbils, the present study demonstrated that the LZ-group (51.68 g ± 3.35) showed growth retardation, contrary to the AZ- and SZ-groups (58.03 g ± 2.18 and 62.35 g ± 2.04, respectively). Concentrations of zinc in the liver, kidneys and testes in the LZ-group (41.28, 19.58, 22.55 mg/kg, respectively) were significantly lower than in the AZ-group (57.27, 23.73, 28.79 mg/kg, respectively) and the SZ-group (73.06, 30.07, 34.52 mg/kg, respectively). Results also showed that copper and iron concentrations in the kidney, heart and liver were significantly higher in the LZ-group (Cu 11.45, 7.01, 7.95 mg/kg; Fe 116.19, 126.07, 299.47 mg/kg) than in the AZ-group (Cu 8.72, 5.6, 6.5 mg/kg; Fe 97.27, 97.27, 250.25 mg/kg) and the SZ-group (Cu 6.48, 4.15, 4.8 mg/kg; Fe 74.95, 77.95, 200.27 mg/kg). There was an increase of testis copper concentration in the LZ-group (4.9 mg/kg) compared to the AZ- and SZ-groups (3.99 and 3.05 mg/kg, respectively), and there was no significant difference in testis iron concentration between animals in different diet groups. These results showed that a low-zinc diet had negative effects on growth and the concentration of zinc in the kidneys, liver and testes. This also affected homeostasis of copper and iron by increasing its distribution in the kidneys, liver and heart tissue. However, in testes only copper concentration was increased.",

A total of 86 forelimbs were examined. On the forelimbs, dorsolateral-palmaromedial, and dorsomedial-palmarolateral oblique views were performed. The oblique views were performed on raised limbs placed in a navicular block and on weight-bearing limbs placed on a pedestal made at the equine clinic. In total, 688 dorsolateral-palmaromedial and dorsomedial-palmarolateral views were taken. During the evaluation of the radiographs we focused on the detection of signs of degenerative joint disease of the distal and proximal iterphalangeal joints, and the detection of new bone formation in the phalanx regions, not associated with a disease of the distal or proximal interphalangeal joints. Based on the radiographic signs visible on these views, we diagnosed 9 cases of degenerative joint disease of the distal intraphalangeal joint, 13 cases of the degenerative joint disease of the proximal intraphalangeal joint and 21 cases of new bone formation in the phalanx regions. These signs were observed in 253 of 688 oblique views. Positive radiographic findings of the above-mentioned disorders were shown on 127 oblique views of the raised limb placed in the navicular block and 126 oblique views of the weight-bearing limb placed on the pedestal we made. When 128 oblique views of the weight-bearing limb (placed on the pedestal) were compared with those of the raised limb (in the navicular block), there were different radiographic findings in three cases only. The differences in detection rates of radiographic signs between different type views showed no statistical significance ( p ≥ 0.05). Therefore we assume that the pedestal we made can be routinely used for the radiographic examination of the distal and proximal interphalangeal joints on DL-PM and DM-PL oblique views, as part of pre-purchase examination or diagnosis of lameness.",

The initial clinical signs were demonstrated by symmetric, primarily non-pruritic alopecia that began in the perineal, genital, and ventral abdominal regions and propagated cranially to the thorax and to the neck. Based on physical and dermatological examination, laboratory findings, and results of skin biopsy, a hormone-responsive dermatosis was diagnosed. Once hypothyroidism and hyperadrenocorticism were ruled out, with the help of hormonal tests, the diagnosis was specified as alopecia X. The first treatment option recommended for the patient and subsequently completed was ovariohysterectomy. After three months, the owner reported improvement; the dog was almost covered with hair. The patient was presented again six months later, showing almost the same dermatological symptoms, which, however, were of a more striking character than before ovariohysterectomy. Again a series of hormonal tests was carried out. Considering the elevated basal and post-adrenocorticothropin stimulation progesterone concentrations, the final aetiology of the disease was determined as an adrenal sex hormone imbalance. Therefore trilostan therapy was initiated. The trilostan dosage of 8 mg/kg/day was divided and given 2 times daily. This treatment led to complete hair regrowth in the dog within four months. No adverse effects associated with trilostane were recognized.",

Beagle puppies (n = 14) of three litters were used. The puppies of litters 1 and 2 were from a research breeding facility and litter 3 from a dog breeder. They were nursed by their dams and obtained extra puppy food from the 4th week of age. The puppies were weighed weekly. Morning urine was sampled at the age of up to 48 h, and 7, 14, 21, 24, 35, and 56 days. Urine cortisol was measured using the RIA method, and creatinine was determined using a diagnostic kit. The urine cortisol to creatinine ratio (UCCR) was calculated. The body mass of puppies increased more than ten times. The UCCR for litters 1 and 2 as against litter 3 showed no significant differences and therefore the results were pooled. Thus no effect of the rearing environment upon this indicator was found. The UCCR values in puppies aged up to 48 h was 44.32 ± 30.47 × 10 -6 . Its following changes (a decrease to 30.52 ± 12.98 × 10 -6 on day 7 and oscillations around these values until day 49) as well as an increase on day 56 were not significant. Characteristic features of the UCCR in puppies were values surpassing those reported for healthy adult animals, and a great inter-individual variability, presumably reflecting the maturation processes such as rapidly increasing body mass and skeletal musculature mass, changes in nutrition, locomotory activity and maturation of their excretory system. The specific features of this period should be considered when evaluating the UCCR in puppies.",

Rats with liver damage induced by thioacetamide were divided into an experimental and control group. Experimental and control animals were applied Mutaflor and saline, respectively. Samples of blood, liver, lymph nodes and caecum for microbiological examination, of liver, duodenum and oesophagus for histological examination and of spleen for weight evaluation were collected. There were no significant differences between both groups of animals in the qualitative proportion of Staphylococcus spp., Enterococcus spp. and Proteus spp. cultured from the lymph nodes, blood and liver. The quantitative culture results on Enterococcus spp. in the caecum, liver and lymph nodes showed no significant differences between both groups. There was a significant difference between the experimental and control group in the counts of coliform bacteria. No significant differ - ences between both groups were found in the overall damage score of the liver, duodenum and oesophagus. There were no differences in the spleen to body weight ratio of both groups. The application of Mutaflor ® suspension for eight days had no recognisable effect diminishing the selected complications of chronic liver damage caused by the administration of TAA to laboratory rats.",

    "abstract": "An 18-year old intact female Bactrian camel ( Camelus bactrianus ) was suffering from lameness due to a mass on the right dorsal metacarpal region that caused acute swelling and local skin necrosis. Histology examination and immunohistochemistry of the biopsy material of a mass revealed haemangiosarcoma of the extensor tendons. Three weeks after the biopsy, the tumour was enlarged to 6 cm in diameter and the animal became disabled. The tumour with its associated tendon were resected and the tendon’s edges were bridged with a synthetic polytape graft. The camel was fully weight-bearing after the surgery. Two weeks later, the graft was removed due to widespread necrosis. Since the wound was positive for Corynebacterium sp., Acinetobacter iwoffii , Micrococcus sp., Escherichia coli , and Staphylococcus sp., the post-operative antibiotic treatment was prolonged for 28 days. Four months later, the wound healed using daily irrigation and bandaging and the camel walked normally. Nine months after diagnosis, the camel suddenly died without any clinical signs. Metastases of the haemangiosarcoma were found in the liver, lungs, kidneys, brain, meninges, and mediastinum. Exsanguination due to rupture of a liver metastasis was determined as the cause of the death. Haemangiosarcoma is a malignant neoplasm that arises from endothelial cells of blood vessels and tends to be very aggressive. To the author’s knowledge, this is the first case report of a metastasizing haemangiosarcoma arising from the lateral extensor tendon in a Bactrian camel.",

In the present study the anaesthetic efficacy of 1-phenoxy-2-propanol and its influence on biochemical and haematological blood indices of juvenile common carp were studied. For blood profile test, fish were divided into four groups (n = 10). The haematological and blood biochemical profiles of common carp were evaluated 10 min and 24 h after anaesthesia with 1-phenoxy-2-propanol (400 mg·dm -3 ) and compared to non-anaesthetized control groups. Significant changes ( P &lt; 0.05) in red blood cell indices and in white blood cell count were found as well. Increased concentrations of glucose, ammonia and inorganic phosphates indicate that stress reaction occurred. No changes in total protein, globulin, triacylglycerols, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase and calcium were found. Although exposure to 1-phenoxy-2-propanol caused a moderate, temporary stress response in examined fish, we can state that 1-phenoxy-2-propanol can be used as an effective anaesthetic for common carp.",

    "abstract": "The autonomic nervous system is a sophisticated and independent structure composed of two antagonistic (opposing) divisions (sympathetic and parasympathetic) that control many vital functions including: homeostasis maintenance, heart rate, blood circulation, secretion, etc. Thymus is one of the most important primary lymphoid organs playing a role in the developing of a juvenile’s immune system mainly by maturation, development, and migration of T-cells (T lymphocytes). In the last decades, several studies identifying sources of the thymic autonomic supply have been undertaken in humans and several laboratory rodents but not in higher mammals such as the pig. Therefore, in the present work, retrograde tracing technique of Fast Blue and DiI was used to investigate the sources of sympathetic efferent supply to the porcine thymus. After Fast Blue injection into the right lobe of the thymus, the presence of Fast Blue-positive neurons was found in the unilateral cranial cervical ganglion (82.8 ± 3.0% of total Fast Blue-positive neurons) as well as in the middle cervical ganglion (17.2 ± 3.0%). Injection of DiI resulted in the presence of retrograde tracer in neurons of the cranial cervical ganglion (80.4 ± 2.3% of total amount of DiI-labelled neurons), the middle cervical ganglion (18.4 ± 1.9%), and the cervicothoracic ganglion (1.2 ± 0.8%). The present report provides the first data describing in details the localization of primary efferent sympathetic neurons innervating the porcine thymus.",

Male Wistar rats (n = 24) were divided into four groups (A–D). In groups A (22–25 °C) and B (4–8 °C), blood perfusion rate was 10 ml/h and the graft was placed in a water bath. Groups C, D were initially rinsed with cold (4–8 °C) Hartmann solution (C) and cold saline solution (D), next the graft was placed in a water bath of cold (4–8 °C) Hartmann solution (C) or saline solution (D). The observed time was 30 min after the implemented perfusion (A, B) or initial rinsing (C, D). At 30 min, hearts of all the groups were perfused for 10 min with prograde-autologous arterialized blood at room temperature. At perfusion minute 10, blood was collected for biochemical analysis (sample 1). Sample 2 involved blood from a portable syringe infusion pumps (in parallel with sample 1). Pairwise test differences between samples 1 and 2 were significant in all the groups as regards creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase values, sampling 1 values being always higher, while cardiac troponin I concentrations were non-significant in the same comparison. The heart rate during the final perfusion was identical in all the groups. Our study has demonstrated that all observed cardioprotection modes are useful for experimental heart grafting.",

    "abstract": "Unstable fractures of the thoracic spine represent a serious\nsocial and economic issue. They can lead to persistent\nconsequences and chronic disease. The anatomical and\nbiomechanical characteristics of the thoracic spine are\ndifferent from all the other spinal parts due to its higher\nmovability. The vertebrae of the chest area are less mobile\nconferring a higher degree of rigidity to the spine. To\ndestabilize this relatively rigid system, a considerable force\nis necessary. The treatment of unstable spinal fractures is\nsolely surgical. The decompression of the spinal canal with\nreposition and stabilization of the fracture is indicated\nurgently. This intervention is performed mostly from the\nposterior approach in the first phase. However, the anterior\nspinal column is the structure responsible for the stability of\nthe spine. Therefore, the recent advances in spine surgery\nfocus on this area of expertise. For this reason, we carried\nout a bio-mechanical study aimed at assessing the effectiveness\nof two surgical tactics used. The study consists in comparative\nexperiments performed by computer aided device on segments of\npig cadavers. The experiment involves a comparison of segments\nof thoracic spine under the following conditions: an\nanatomically intact segment, a spine segment with an\nartificially created anterior instability, and a segment with\nan applied internal fixator. The experiment compared the\nmechanical characteristics of these segments. The experiment\nhas demonstrated that after application of the internal fixator\nused for stabilization of injured anterior spinal column at\ndefined pre-loading of 200 N, the stability of damaged spinal\nsegment in torsion increased twofold. It was also verified that\nsufficient stability can be ensured using the Modular Anterior\nConstruct System (MACSTL) implant for ventral stabilization of\nthoracic spine unstable injuries. Endoscopic application of\nthis implant represents an additional advantage of this\nsurgical procedure.",

    "abstract": "The study focused on the welfare of end-of-lay hens during their transportation for slaughter from the viewpoint of the stress load on hens resulting from unsatisfactory treatment that leads to traumatic injury to the limbs of hens detected during the veterinary examination of hens at the slaughterhouse. Blood samples were taken during bleeding after slaughter at the slaughterhouse for the determination of corticosterone and other biochemical indices from 35 hens with traumatic limb injuries and 35 hens without traumatic limb injuries. The stress load during the transportation of hens for slaughter potentiated by traumatic injuries was found to increase ( P &lt; 0.01) the plasma corticosterone concentration as an indicator of stress in birds (6381 pg/ml vs. 3681 pg/ml) and affect the plasma concentration of some biochemical indices, in particular increasing ( P &lt; 0.05) the level of total protein and albumin and decreasing ( P &lt; 0.05) levels of triglycerides, calcium and alanine aminotransferase. These findings demonstrate that hens with traumatic limb injuries occurring during the course of transport (loading, transport, unloading) are burdened by a greater degree of stress than hens that have not suffered traumatic injuries. From the viewpoint of the protection and welfare of end-of-lay hens, this study unequivocally demonstrates the necessity of the corresponding careful handling of birds during their loading onto and unloading from means of transport during transportation to the slaughterhouse – the kind of handling that does not cause injuries and, thereby, an increased stress load on hens slaughtered at the slaughterhouse.",

    "abstract": "African swine fever virus is the causative agent of an acute and highly contagious disease affecting domestic and wild members of the family Suidae . The virus can be transmitted by direct contact among infected animals or via a contaminated environment or feed. Since the contaminated meat or products thereof have been characterised as the most probable vehicle in several outbreaks, the aim of the present study was to define viability of the virus in meat under conditions of freezing and chilling (−25 °C and 6 °C) and low temperature cooking (55 °C for 2.5 h and for 1 h). Two independent methods were employed; cell culture as a reference and real-time polymerase chain reaction combined with palladium compound (BB-PdCl 2 and PdCl 2 COD) pre-treatment as an alternative method. Obtained results demonstrated a minimal decrease in the infectious virus titre during storage at −25 °C, and a remaining amount of viruses in meat stored at 6 °C for 14 months that can cause a disease after ingestion. The results obtained by both methods applied on the samples corresponded to each other. In contrast, results related to the virus’ persistence in thermal-treated meat indicated much lower stability than previously thought; infectious viruses were not detected by infectivity assay after the treatment at 55 °C for 1 h. The observed difference of one order of magnitude of virus detected using palladium compound pre-treatment suggests presence of intact rather than infectious viruses. A better suitability of PdCl 2 COD compared to BB-PdCl 2 pre-treatment was demonstrated.",

Holstein-Friesian and Simmental cows and calves were immunized with M. haemolytica leukotoxin (Lkt) and outer membrane proteins (OMPs) at 6 and 4 weeks before parturition. Sera and colostrum were collected from the cows directly after calving. Sera from calves were obtained before colostrum intake and 48 h after birth. Calves from vaccinated and unvaccinated cows were placed in the feedlot and immunized with Lkt or OMP on days 10 and 24. Calves were tested for serum antibodies against respiratory viruses. Trachea and lung samples were collected for bacteriological examination from all calves that had died with BRDC. The results indicated high colostrum values and IgG transfer in calves at 48 h (&gt; 12.5 g/l) and a high concentration of anti-BVD antibodies in calves at 48 h (&gt; 33–45 mg/ml). Similar values were observed for bovine herpes virus BHV-1 and bovine respiratory sycytil virus BRSV. Immunoglobulin concentrations were highest for antibodies specific to parainfluenza PI-3 and adenoviruses. The lowest antibody levels were detected against M. haemolytica antigens in all experimental groups of calves (&lt; 50 mg/ml in calves of cows vaccinated with M. haemolytica antigens and &lt; 25 mg/ml in calves of unvaccinated cows).

The aim of this study was to define the frequency of such transmission. At the same time, the degree of closeness of owner-animal cohabitation, the effect on the spectrum of shared FF and health risk assessment were defined. The effect of previous antibiotic therapy on fungal flora was also assessed. In total, 150 pet owners and 135 pet animals from 125 households provided 911 samples; 80 non-owners provided 320 samples. All owners completed a questionnaire focusing on the level of contact with the pet and information on previous antibiotic treatment. The relationship between the contact index (CI) and the effect of previous antibiotic treatment on the number of FF species shared was quantified. Results were compared with those of non-owners. The CI was very close (CI &gt; 4) in 131 owners (87.3%). A total of 110 FF were isolated. Common FF were found in 42 households (33.6%); 65 FF were identified in the non-owners. In the last year, 46 pets, 43 owners and 25 non-owners used antimicrobial agents. Aspergillus niger was most prevalent in owners and pets and Alternaria alternata in non-owners. The degree of contact intimacy did not seem to have any effect on the joint abundance of FF, but antibiotic treatment had a significant effect on FF abundance in non-owners. This effect was not significant in either owners or pets.",

    "abstract": "A 6-year-old thoroughbred gelding was admitted to the clinic with acute severe lameness and swelling of the front limb fetlock area. The traditional examination methods (clinical, radiography, and ultrasonography) were insufficient to identify the exact pathological changes causing the lameness. Despite conservative treatment, the condition of the horse deteriorated and the horse was euthanized after 15 days. A diagnosis was determined by post mortem CT examination and an autopsy of the affected limb. From several pathological findings, an acute cystoid lesion in the first phalanx communicating with the fetlock joint was determined to be the probable main cause of the severe lameness in this horse.",

    "abstract": "A 7-year-old, castrated male, Dachshund dog initially presented with locked-jaw syndrome. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging indicated bilateral lymphadenopathy, but no skeletal or joint disorder was suspected. The dog showed no evidence of masticatory muscle myositis in the masticatory muscle antibody test and histopathologic examination, indicating non-infectious inflammation. Temporomandibular disorder due to immune-mediated disease was suspected, and the symptoms improved following prednisolone treatment. One year later, the dog was referred with multiple joint swellings and fever. Based on radiographic findings, synovial fluid analysis, and positive results of the antinuclear antibody test, systemic lupus erythematosus was diagnosed. The previous temporomandibular disorder might have been caused by systemic lupus erythematosus showing typical characteristics of recurrence and instability of various musculoskeletal systems. The symptoms were also relieved by glucocorticoid treatment. This report describes a case of systemic lupus erythematosus in a dog that was previously treated for temporomandibular disease, implying that systemic lupus erythematosus might be a cause of temporomandibular disorder or the two diseases might be associated in dogs.",

Abdominal radiographs showed severe pneumoperitoneum and an intestinal mass. Computed tomography revealed massive pneumoperitoneum associated with intestinal perforation, with cervical and thoracoabdominal wall emphysema, pneumomediastinum, pneumoretroperitoneum, pneumoscrotum, and peritonitis. Surgery confirmed a ruptured jejunal mass, and histopathologic evaluation of the excised tissues revealed intestinal lymphoma. Clinicians should therefore consider the possibility of gastrointestinal perforation in patients with severe pneumoperitoneum even where there is no history of trauma.

    "abstract": "The study investigates the interspecies similarities between canine and human mammary cancer in the sense of innovative predictive and prognostic tumour markers. Surgical resection specimens with diagnosed spontaneous primary mammary cancer obtained from 100 female canine patients were included in this study. Expression of carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) enzyme and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression was evaluated immunohistochemically. The study was completed with investigation of Ki67 expression and proliferation with marker of myogenous differentiation. Histopathological grading was performed using the Nottingham/modified Bloom-Richardson system. As in humans, our analysis of canine mammary cancer has shown that CAIX positivity in tumour cells significantly correlates with higher levels of HER2 immunoreactivity ( P = 0.001), and increased tumour grade ( P &lt; 0.001). The percentage of smooth muscle actin (SMA) positive cases was significantly higher ( P = 0.002) in the group of mammary carcinomas with CAIX positivity compared to the tumours that were negative. Using antibody Ki67 proliferative activity was not significantly different between mammary tumours that were CAIX positive and CAIX negative. Canine mammary gland carcinomas may, therefore, represent valuable animal models for the study of hypoxic signaling pathways involved in mammary carcinogenesis in humans. Further research investigating this possibility is required.",

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum are protozoon parasites from the intracellular apicomplexan family. Toxoplasma gondii is the cause of health and economic problems in the sheep industry worldwide. Neospora caninum is usually reported in cows and leads to infections causing abortions; however, its prevalence in sheep is not clear. The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and pathology of T. gondii and N. caninum by PCR, histopathological and immune-histochemical methods in aborted sheep foetuses collected at different sheep flocks in the Van Province, Türkiye, in 2021. Firstly, the DNA of T. gondii and N. caninum were investigated by PCR in the brain, heart, and peritoneal fluid samples from 42 sheep foetuses. Toxoplasma gondii DNA was proved in 35.7% (15/42) of foetuses whereas N. caninum DNA was not determined in any of the samples. Histopathologically, all T. gondii positive brain tissue samples showed lymphohistiocytic multifocal encephalomyelitis and additional findings included necrotizing myocarditis in the positive heart samples. Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites were identified in the lesions (diffuse or focal mononuclear cell infiltration in the meninges, and microglia proliferation, myocarditis with oedema) by anti- T. gondii antibodies by the immunohistochemical method. Based on our results, we can conclude that T. gondii is an important agent in sheep abortions and the PCR method is a suitable method for diagnosis which can also be used in heart tissue in pathological studies.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the motor nerve conduction velocity in the tibial nerve after surface stimulation in healthy dogs, to correlate the obtained data by biological factors, and to compare these results with published findings utilizing needle electrodes. The study was performed in 11 clinically healthy dogs without anaesthesia. There were significant correlations among several indicators (age, limb length, conduction velocity, latency and duration of compound muscle action potentials). Age was found to have a significant effect on the duration of the compound muscle action potential from both stimulation sites (proximal/distal; r = 0.68, r = 0.71, P &lt; 0.05), but there was no effect on the conduction velocity or amplitude of the compound muscle action potentials. Limb length was found to have a significant effect on the duration of the compound muscle action potential from the distal stimulation site (r = 0.64, P &lt; 0.05), a significant effect on the conduction velocity (r = −0.91, P &lt; 0.01), and a significant effect on the amplitude of the compound muscle action potential from both stimulation sites (proximal/distal; r = −0.76, r = −0.63, P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.05 respectively). These results indicate that limb length should be considered as the most important biological factor in tibial nerve conduction studies and that electroneurography in dogs could be performed non-invasively, without a danger of infection, haematomas or complications related to anaesthesia.",

Cell detachment was around 5 log CFU/cm 2 (colony forming units) over the first 6 h and around 6 log CFU/cm 2 over 48 h characterizing a high persistence of cells on the tested surface. The number of cells (5–7 log CFU/cm 2 ) needed for biofilm formation was noted already after 6 h of incubation. The decrease in cell counts caused by preparation A was 1.12–2.07 log CFU/cm 2 ( P &lt; 0.0001), whereas for preparation C and preparation B, the decrease was 1.13–2.08 log CFU/cm 2 and 1.61–2.16 log CFU/cm 2 , respectively ( P &lt; 0.0001). Preparation A was found to be the most effective (80.9%) in reducing the adhered cell count in the biofilm matrix. From these results, the assayed S. aureus strain revealed high capacities to adhere and form biofilms on stainless steel surfaces, and the cells in biofilm matrixes were resistant to total removal when exposed to the evaluated disinfectants.",

The current study investigated the relationship between IOP and CCT in horses of different ages, sex, breed, and body weights using tonometry and pachymetry. Ninety-seven horses without ocular disease were examined at the Equine Clinic of the University of Veterinary Sciences Brno, Czech Republic, between 2019 and 2020. A complete ophthalmological examination was performed, including direct ophthalmoscopy and slit-lamp biomicroscopy, to include only horses with healthy eyes in the study. The central corneal thickness was measured with a pachymeter, and the IOP was measured with a tonometer. The effects of sex, age, breed, and horse weight on IOP and CCT were analysed. Measurements of IOP and CCT were acquired in all 97 horses. There was a significant correlation between CCT and age and weight in both eyes. Older and heavier individuals had high CCT values. Mares had lower IOP mean values compared to geldings and stallions. No correlation was found between IOP and CCT of the same eye. This study confirmed a relationship between individual variables such as age and weight on CCT, and sex on IOP. Based on this report, CCT should be considered a minor indicator when interpreting IOP values in healthy horses. Nevertheless, age and weight are essential constraints when interpreting CCT values and sex on IOP values in horses.",

This study aims at evaluating the prognostic value of plasma protein C activity in dogs (n = 34) with PSS treated surgically using an ameroid constrictor. Plasma protein C activity was measured in the following time periods: preoperatively (T1), 2 days after surgery (T2), 8 weeks after surgery (T3) and &gt; 6 months after surgery (T4). There was a significant increase in plasma protein C activity between T1/T2 and T3/T4 ( P &lt; 0.001).

The aim of the study was to investigate Salmonella and endo-parasite carriage in hedgehogs and to determine the antibacterial resistance profiles of isolated Salmonella agents. Free-range hedgehogs living in parks and gardens of Istanbul that were brought to veterinary clinics by animal lovers for check-up and treatment were used for sampling. Thirty faecal samples were taken from the animals. For bacteriological examinations, samples were seeded on selective media, and then the isolates were identified by conventional methods as Salmonella spp. Identification and antibiotic susceptibilities of the isolates were determined by the BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System. All faecal samples were also investigated by PCR for Salmonella spp. specific gene regions. The aminoglycoside and quinolone resistance profiles of the strains were analysed by PCR. On parasitological examination, samples were analysed for parasites’ eggs, oocysts, and larvae. Two Salmonella isolates were determined as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ), whose antigenic formula was 4,5,12:i:1,2. The isolates were phenotypically resistant to ciprofloxacin but did not harbour any of the genes examined. Out of 30 faecal samples, 19 (63.3%) were positive for one or more genera of parasites. The hedgehogs were infected with the species of Capillaria spp. (60%), Crenosoma spp. (13.3%), Eimeria spp. (10%) and Acanthocephala spp. (6.6%).

Based on the evaluation of the growth curve, PLGA/MUP NPs inhibited growth of the both tested strains already at a concentration of 0.29 µg/ml, and their inhibitory effect at concentrations from 0.29 to 1.17 µg/ml was comparable with free MUP using the disk-diffusion method. PLGA/MUP NPs also tended to increase the abundance of the dead cells of MRSA, but not of S. aureus , in comparison with free MUP when evaluated by fluorescence microscopy. Further, cryo-SEM evaluation demonstrated an antibacterial-inhibitory effect of PLGA/MUP NPs on S. aureus in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, PLGA/MUP NPs cytotoxic activity tended to be substantially lower in comparison with both free MUP and empty PLGA NPs. It can be concluded that the excellent biocompatibility and satisfactory antibacterial effects of PLGA/MUP NPs constitute a suitable alternative as far as cutaneous wound healing is concerned.",

We aimed to identify potential stem cell subpopulations in porcine and bovine endometrium by measuring the expression of selected stem cell markers (OCT3/4, CD44, SSEA-1, SOX10, CD73, and CD117) during the follicular and luteal phases of the oestrous cycle. We studied 28 endometrial tissue samples collected from 14 healthy, cycling pigs and cows. The endometrial mucosa of each sample was divided into basal, middle, and luminal portions, and the immunohistochemical staining intensity and percentages of cells that were marker-positive were recorded for each portion of the endometrium. Expression of OCT-3/4 was identified in the glands and stroma, and that of SOX10 and CD117 was identified in stroma of both porcine and bovine endometrium. In porcine endometrium, CD44 was only expressed in the glands, whereas SSEA-1 was expressed in the glands and stroma. In bovine endometrium, CD73 was only expressed in the glands. Differences in the expression of most of these markers were found between phases of the oestrous cycle and/or portions of the endometrial mucosa. Our data indicate the existence of both epithelial and mesenchymal stem cell subpopulations in the endometrium of pigs and cows during their oestrous cycles. The expression pattern of the stem cell marker SSEA-1 in porcine endometrium suggests a possible alternative location of the epithelial stem/progenitor cell population in the middle portion of the endometrial glands.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of cystinuria in dogs of various breeds in the Czech Republic. In total, 326 voided urine samples from client owned dogs were obtained. Samples were divided into four groups according to the breed - Irish Terriers (n = 58), Dachshunds (n = 67), French Bulldogs (n = 64) and a group of various breeds (n = 137). Urinary cystine concentration was measured using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, urinary creatinine concentration was determined by Jaffe method. Samples with urinary cystine concentrations above 178 µmol/g creatinine were considered as cystinuric. Urinary cystine concentration above the upper limit was found in 71 dogs (21.8%) with significantly higher incidence in intact males of Irish Terriers. In general, cystinuria was more common in intact males. In Irish Terriers, Dachshunds, French Bulldogs, German Shorthaired Pointer, Pomeranian, and Fox Terrier, cystinuria was identified in females. Cystinuria appears to be a relatively common finding in dogs in the Czech Republic, with some breeds being more affected. The finding of cystinuria in two female Irish Terriers calls into question the classification of cystinuria in this breed as androgen dependent only. The detection of cystinuria in related dogs suggests that other individuals in the same family should be examined as part of the management of a cystinuric patient.",

    "abstract": "The aging process is still not fully understood, although it has been studied for centuries. One of the processes in the brain during aging is the accumulation of extracellular and intracellular deposits of amyloid and lipofuscin. Deposits of various polyglucosan bodies (PGBs) are also found in brain tissue. The accumulation of the Lafora bodies (LB), a type of PGBs, can cause the Lafora disease (LD). Initial signs of the disease in humans are tonic-clonic seizures with blindness and myoclonus seizures. Normally, all haematological and biochemical indices are within the reference range in dogs with this disease. In this case, a 7-year-old Chihuahua dog with tonic-clonic seizures was presented. According to history, neurological examination, and blood test, toxic, metabolic, and infectious causes for the seizures were ruled out. The dog was started on phenobarbital 2.5 mg/kg twice daily per os . Two years later, the dog died due to complications caused by a duodenal foreign body. Postmortem examination revealed hyperaemic meninges and an enlarged, oedematous brain with flattened gyri and narrowed sulci. Histopathological examination revealed multifocal to diffuse, randomly distributed PGBs that were positive on periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining. The diagnosis of LD in dogs is of great importance because they are a good experimental model for neurological studies of neurodegenerative diseases in humans.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the mycobiome composition of the lower respiratory tract in asthmatic horses using fungal culture, quantitative multiplex real-time PCR analysis (FungiMultiPlex) and Next-Generation Sequencing approach. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples obtained from 45 client-owned horses diagnosed with equine asthma were analysed by fungal culture (19 samples), FungiMultiPlex (34 samples), and Next-Generation Sequencing (14 samples). The fungal culture was positive in 11/19 (58%) cases, and FungiMultiPlex was positive in 19/34 (56%) cases. No fungal PCR product was detected by Next-Generation Sequencing analysis. Fungal culture and FungiMultiPlex methods were performed simultaneously on eight horses only. Association of results of these methods was calculated using Phi coefficient (φ= 0.333), and concordance between the methods was not confirmed ( P = 0.420). The results of this study suggest that the fungal culture and quantitative multiplex real-time PCR might be considered diagnostically useful to assess the presence of fungi in BALF in a semiquantitative and quantitative manner, respectively. The Next-Generation Sequencing method seems to be less diagnostically suitable due to technical obstacles pertinent to both the low concentration of microbial agents in the rather diluted BALF samples, and, also, due to the relatively high environmental background contamination of the collected material. Based on our data, we advocate the use of the combination of quantitative multiplex real-time PCR and fungal culture in a routine clinical diagnostic setting.",

However, primates are also kept as pets. The aim of the study was to assess the species and numbers of primates kept in the Czech Republic as pets; for comparison, the species and numbers of primates kept in Czech zoos were also monitored. According to the CITES register, a total of 7,708 primates of 79 species from nine families were kept in both types of facilities (data valid as of 31 December 2020). Of these, 3,821 individuals were kept as pets and 3,877 in zoos. The most commonly kept species were the western pygmy marmoset, common marmoset, golden-handed tamarin, Guianan squirrel monkey from the Cebidae family, ring-tailed lemurs and black-and-white ruffed lemur from the Lemuridae family, mandrill, guereza, Japanese macaque, and bonnet macaque from the Cercopithecidae family. No primates of the Hominidae and Atelidae families were recorded in the case of pet keeping. The results show that in the Czech Republic, the number of primates kept as pets is comparable to their numbers in zoos. However, the question is whether this is a positive finding, given the difficulty of creating conditions for pet primates that meet their requirements, and also given that the contribution of pet keeping to the preservation of their population on Earth is questionable.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a global public health challenge and one of the main risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Its pandemic prevalence created a demand for developing a relevant model system for deep insight into the molecular basis of MetS. Animal models, especially Wistar rats, are commonly used for that purpose. However, there are no standardized protocols in terms of the diet, strain, or age of rats used for the development of MetS. Studies have mostly used a high-fat high-fructose (HFHF) diet in Wistar rats but have reported inconsistent results; thus the main aim of this study was to examine the effects of the HFHF diet on inducing MetS in Wistar rats. We used two different sub-strains of Wistar rats – Hannover and Kyoto – of two different age groups (8 weeks and 4 months). Animals were placed on a modified diet, standard chow diet enriched with 25% fat and 20% fructose. Following 8 weeks of treatment, all groups were tested for indicators of MetS and the treatment was extended to 16 weeks for groups that developed some of the required parameters. None of the tested groups developed MetS after 16 weeks of HFHF diet, suggesting that the HFHF diet is not sufficient to develop at least three out of five (visceral obesity, high fasting glucose, high triglyceride, low HDL-cholesterol, high blood pressure) needed parameters. Based on our results, the addition of some pharmacological agents (e.g., cholic acid) is necessary for establishing a rat model system of MetS.",

Contraction of the deep digital flexor tendon and flexural deformity on the right front limb was the primary diagnosis established by the equine practitioner. The filly was referred to the Equine clinic of the University of Veterinary Medicine and Pharmacy (UVMP) in Košice for desmotomy of the accessory ligament of the deep digital flexor tendon. The final, primary diagnosis obtained by a complex diagnostic approach was osteochondrosis of the scapulohumeral joint. Presence of multiple pathologies on the right front limb was detected, but the main source of painful clinical manifestation was the condition of the scapulohumeral joint. This report describes an uncommon, rarely diagnosed pathological condition, which can lead to unfavourable prognosis. Osteochondrosis of the scapulohumeral joint was the reason for humane euthanasia of the filly in this case. The clinical case was completed by postmortem findings.",

The pooled ejaculate was divided into five equal parts as control (C) and Tris diluent containing 25, 50, 100, 200 μg/ml JB. Diluted semen was incubated at 4 °C for 4 h and then frozen in liquid nitrogen (−196 °C). After freezing-thawing, motility characteristics were determined using a sperm analyzer system. The results showed that the 25 μg/ml dose of JB had an improving effect on overall sperm motility ( P &lt; 0.05). The total abnormal spermatozoa ratio was not significantly different between the groups ( P &gt; 0.05). The JB25 and JB50 groups had higher DNA integrity than the other groups ( P &lt; 0.05). This finding was supported by low malondialdehyde levels ( P &lt; 0.05). Especially the 25 μg/ml dose of JB was found to have a remedial effect on DNA integrity, as well as increasing progressive and total motility rates. This study has revealed new information on the effects of JB on bull semen cryopreservation. Juniper berry oil may be used as an antioxidant in bull semen freezing.",

The analysis of 115 reports on R. infection in man showed that only 59 (51 %) contained data on the possible exposure to animals, manure or soil. The positive contact was reported in 35 cases (30 %) and denied in 24 cases (21 %). The most common type of contact was the exposure to horses or horse manure, being mentioned in 18 cases. The next most frequent type of exposure was farming. In the animal exposure positive group the median age was 30 years, male to female ratio (M:F) was 3.38 and the clinical outcome was fatal in 10 cases out of 35 (29 %). In the group of patient without the animal exposure the median age was 39 years, M:F was 3.0 and the outcome was fatal in 11 cases out of 24 (46 %). The differences were not significant. There was also no difference in the presence of HI V infection between patients with and without the animal exposure, HIV infection being reported in 16 out of 35 patients with the positive animal exposure and in 12 out of 24 of patients without such exposure. It is concluded that with a better epidemiological history the true percentage of R. infected persons with positive animal exposure may be higher. equi, infections of man, contact with animals, manure or soil (Magnusson) Goodfellow and Alderson 1977, formerly named equi, has been for a long time considered a zoopathogenic microbe, mainly an agent of pneumonia in young equidae, mostly in foals (Prescott 1991). Since 1967, infections in humans, usually pneumonias or lung abscesses, have been reported (Golub et al. 1967). Immunodeficient persons, e.g. patients under cytotoxic therapy for malignancies, under immunosuppression after renal transplantation or alcoholics, are usually infected. After acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) turned out, many cases of rhodococcal lung infections in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive persons have been reported, the first one by Samies et al. (1986). Though many reviews of human R. infections eXist (the most recent e.g. McNeil and Brown 1994; Verville et al. 1994; Scott et al. 1995), none was aimed specifically at a possible contact of patients with animals. An analytical study from this point of view was made the topic of our paper. Materials and Methods MEDLINE data base was searched through using the terms Rhodococcus equi and Corynebacterium equi for relevant reports and references quoted in the reports were compared with our own collection of reprints. When the original source was not obtained, the data from reviews were employed (Doig et al. 1991; Drancourt et al. 1992; Harvey and Sunstrum 1991; Verville et al. 1995). Only reports concerning fully identified R. strains were considered. We searched the text for data relative to the patient's contact with animals. esp.livestock. and with manure or soil. When the contact was not stated explicitly in the history of an individual case reported but its importance as a risk factor was mentioned by the author, such a report was considered for the purpose of this study as denying the contact of the respective patient.",

Japanese quail kept individually in cages were inseminated under conditions of 22-day hypodynamy. Fertility and hatchability of their eggs were assessed. The efficiency of the insemination depended on the number of inseminations. Compared with the results obtained upon natural breeding, it was 58.2% lowerin quailinseminated twice and 35.9% lower in birds inseminated theree times in individual cages; under the conditions ofhypodynamy it was 62.8% lower aftertwo inseminations and41.7% lower aftertheree inseminations. There were no substantial differences in egg production between the groups. In male quail subjected to 22-day hypodynamy semen volume, sperm concentration and blood plasma testosterone level were reduced. It is recommended that under space flight conditions quail should be inseminated every two or three days and the male-female ratio should be 1: 1. Selection should be made of male quail having high semen volume and high sperm concentration on the basis of their blood plasma testosterone level under the conditions of hypodynamy. Japanese quail,fertility, insemination, plasma testosteron The results obtained so far both in model experiments on Earth and under space flight conditions have provided a basis for achieving a long-term objective to conclude the reproductive cycle of Japanese quail under microgravity conditions and to produce Japanese quail cosmic population ( Bod a 1979). Evidence has been obtained to indicate that in microgravity the embryonic development and hatching of Japanese quail from eggs that were fertilized and developed in the oviduct and uterus under gravity conditions is possible (Me Ie s hko etal. 1991; Bod a eta!. 1991). However, the question remains as to the effect of gravity on fertilization and embryonic development in the oviduct from fertilization to egg-laying and particularly on the development of dorso-ventral and cranio-caudal polarity. The blastoderm of a newly-laid egg is a bilateral symmetric system (V 0 n B ae r 1928). Some writers (Clevert et al. 1955; Vintemberg et al. 1960; Clevert 1963) have concluded that the bilateral symmetry is shifted by rotation of the egg in the uterus and that the inclination changes the position of the axis. These writers did not regard gravity as playing a major role in this process. According to other writers (Kochava et al. 1971; Eyal-Giladi et al. 1980; Fabian et al. 1981) gravity is a prerequisite for development of the cranio-caudal polarity. The definitive answer as to the possibility of fertilization in weightlessness and the influence of gravity on the development of symmetry can be given only by experiments conducted under the conditions of micro gravity. We attempted to contribute to the resolution of this problem on an experimental hypodynamy model used successfully in our previous experiments on Japanese quail (J u ran i et al. 1983; J u ran i et al. 1988) in studies on the processes of adaptation of the productive and reproductive functions of experimental birds.",

Three cycles of quail egg incubation were performed in the conditions of spaceflight in incuba­ tors of Slovak provenience. In these experiments, 22 embryos were obtained at different stages of development with a variety of anomalies. Frequency of these anomalies exceeded considerably that of terrestrial controls. Analysis of this unique material revealed that the majority of them were defects of the primary nerve structures of the brain and eye as a derivative brain rudiment. Such anomalies accounted for 65%, while the remaining 35% were anomalies of ectoderm and meso­ derm derivatives. It is assumed that the main reasons for this high frequency of anomalies of avian embryogene­ sis under conditions of space flight are both vibrations and overloads during transfer of the space­ ship to orbit. These factors cause changes in the position of the embryo within the egg related to its components such as the air chamber, yolk and albumen. Mechanic displacements of the embryo during launch are then further reinforced by the effects of weightlessness. Embryogenesis, Japanese quail, microphthalmy, anophthalmy, deformations, ectopies Analysis of three joint Russian and Slovak experiments on incubation of Japanese quail eggs is presented. The experiments were carried out in 1979, 1990 and 1992. The embryonic material obtained in these studies allows for first generalizations to be made. To our knowledge, almost no comparable data have been presented yet except for those of Hullinger (1993).",

Cerna: Reactive Oxygen Species in the Pathogenesis of Stress-Induced Gastric Ulceration in Rats and Protective Effect of Omeprazole. Acta vet. Bmo 1996, 65:201-207. To examine the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in stress-induced gastric ulceration and possible protective effect of proton pump inhibitor omeprazole male adult rats were immobilized for 9 hours. Phagocyte-derived ROS were measured using the chemiluminescence method in whole blood obtained at start and after 3,6, and 9 hours of immobilization. As indirect sign of gastric mucosal damage faeces were examined after 3 and 6 hours for blood spots presence and after 9 hours the animals were killed and stomachs were examined. Stress resulted in a gigantic increase of ROS in immobilized animals both without and with omeprazole. Blood spots were not found after 3 hours of immobilization. After 6 hours, massive presence of blood spots was found in immobilized animals in contrast to minimal presence (P<O.OOI) in rats treated with omeprazole. The same difference was observed for macroscopically evaluated gastric mucosa after decapitation. We conclude that immobilization causes a large increase of ROS in rats and this increase is not influenced by omeprazole. In contrast, omeprazole decreased bleeding from gastric mucosa and dramatically decreased both number and severity of gastric mucosal lesions.

The seed mordants Agronal Super, which contains the organic mercury (5.4% phenylmercurychloride), has appeared to induce poisoning and even death of many people and animals. Minimal single embryotoxic doses of Agronal Super were estimated in 2-4-day old chick embryos using the CHEST method and compared with the minimal embryotoxic doses of other g seed mordants without mercury. Minimal embryotoxic doses (the beginning of the embryotoxicity range) of Agronal Super were between 0.1-1.0 JLglembryo. The seed mordants without mercury appeared to be less toxic: The minimal embryotoxic doses of Bay tan Combi, Bay tan Universal, Fundasol, Quinolate and Wolfen Thiuram were between 1-10 JLg/embryo. Novozir and Sibutol had minimal embryotoxic doses within the range 10-100 JLglembryo. The least dangerous appeared the seed mordant Vincit, which produced no embryotoxic effect, even after administration of the highest doses (100 JLg/embryo). Our results demonstrated the difference of several orders of magnitude between embryotoxic doses of Agronal Super and other g seed mordants. Replacement of seed mordants containing organic mercury (e.g. Agronal Super) by new ones with minimal or no embryotoxic effect (e.g. Vincit) is advisable.

In prepubertal intact males and females and adult castrated males, norethindrone acetate (NA; a synthetic steroid exhibiting progestational and estrogenic activities)- stimulated mammary growth was decreased by antiprogestins: more by RU 46556 (RU) than RU 38486 (MI) and onapristone (ON). In adult OVX females the inhibitory effect of RU and MI was lower than that of ON. Uterine weights were not significantly decreased by MI, were significantly decreased by RU at a lower daily dose (50 μg) but not affected by a high (500 μg) dose. Seminal vesicle weights were increased by RU but not affected by MI in both NA-treated prepubertal and adult castrated males. In adult castrated but not in prepubertal males ON decreased seminal vesicle weights. In 17β-estradiol (E) plus progesterone (Prog)-treated animals of all four model systems, RU (100 μg/d) acted additively with a submaximal daily dose (10 μg) of antiestrogen ICI 182, 780 (ICI) to produce a lower mammary gland growth rate than ICI alone. In uterus, however, no significant effect of a combination of ICI plus RU was noted when compared with ICI alone. In general, our assay could serve as an in vivo tool for the detection of steroid hormone agonist and antagonist activities of newly synthesized analogs of steroid hormones, and natural and man-made chemicals and extracts of environmental samples.",

    "abstract": "In former Czechoslovakia after the Second World War foot and mouth disease (FMD) was widely spread causing enormous losses to animal production. First reliable data were from 1952 when the FMD was reported in 5,912 villages with 316,997 diseased and 23,112 dead animals. Following a very demanding anti-FMD programme, panzootic occurrence was gradually reduced to sporadic cases and finally to the eradication in 1975. During 1952-1975 there were reported 8,898 new FMD outbreaks (villages). Anti-FMD protection measures, eradication strategy and methods are described. The eradication was achieved mainly thanks to strict measures for avoiding FMD introduction from abroad, animal population health protection including FMD vaccination of threatened populations (annual ratios vaccinations/cattle population oscillated between 0.0293 in 1955 and 1.8168 in 1973 with an average of 0.6445) and timely FMD discovery followed by a rapid response applying very strict intrafocal, perifocal and territorial measures. There were used different complex methods, including stamping-out, adjusted flexibly in time and place to epizootiological situation and influencing factors such as livestock concentration in large units. Important role was played by the strong and centralized public veterinary service with adequate infrastructure, necessary facilities such as FMD diagnostic laboratory, vaccine production and rendering plants, material and financial support. During 1957-1960, a particular epizootiological research was conducted in 70 districts, 245 villages and 459 farms affected by FMD; the results were expressed in morbidity, mortality, sanitary slaughter, disease course, outbreak duration, promptness of disease detection and response, virus types and ways of transmission.",

Healthy 54 adult New Zealand White female rabbits were separated into three groups as control, zinc, and aprotinin treatment. The control animals did not receive any medicament; zinc sulphate was given orally to the rabbits in the Zn group for 15 days. Aprotinin was postoperatively infiltrated into the fracture area at the 3 rd and 24 th h following operation. Immobilization of fracture ends of all groups was similar throughout the experiment. The zinc administered group displayed the highest alkaline phosphatase positive cell level through the experiment. By day 30 after the operation, fibrocartilage and osseous tissues reached the highest levels in the zinc treated group. Based on the observation of augmented osseous tissue formation and increased alkaline phosphatase positive osteoblastic cell activity in the callus, it was conluded that Zn sulphate is a potent stimulator of bone formation by increasing mineralization in the fractured bone segments.",

The aim of the study was to establish a rapid and accurate quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method to detect and enumerate L. lactis subsp. cremoris in artisanal raw cow’s milk cheese. Artisanal raw cow’s milk cheese samples were used to check for presence and number of L. lactis subsp. cremoris strains. The method applies a set of target-specific PCR (polymerase chain reaction) primers and a fluorogenic probe, and amplifies a part of the LACR_RS01280 gene that encodes the aminoacetone oxidase family flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) binding enzyme. All 5 L. lactis subsp. cremoris strains examined were found to be qPCR positive. There was no signal recorded for 8 strains which belong to closely related species. The limit of detection amounted to ten copies per reaction and the assay indicated a linear dynamic range of seven logs. This method may be applied in detection and enumeration of L. lactis subsp. cremoris in cheese during its ripening. Moreover, it may be applied to examine the distribution of L. lactis subsp. cremoris during the cheese production and ripening.",

The animals were subjected to standard physical examinations, radiography and low-field magnetic resonance imaging scans with the use of a contrast agent. The Spin Echo T1 dorsal sequence as well as 3D SST1 transverse and XBONE T1 transverse sequences were highly effective in diagnosing osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the medial humeral condyle. Degenerative changes and the fragmented coronoid process (FCP) of the ulna were very well visualized by High Resolution Gradient Echo, XBONE T2 and Spin Echo T1 sequences in the sagittal plane. The administration of the gadolinium contrast agent, diluted 1:800, to the elbow joint cavity enhances the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance images in evaluations of medial compartment disease, in particular fragmentation of the medial coronoid process.",

    "abstract": "Dysgerminomas are infrequent neoplasms resulting from undifferentiated germinal cells, mainly observed in the bitch. Our case describes for the first time a dysgerminoma related splenic metastasis in a bitch. A 14-year-old crossbred bitch was admitted at our facility with a 3-month history of irregular oestrous cycle, vulvar swelling, haemorrhagic vaginal discharge, lethargy and anorexia. Cytological examination showed the presence of superficial epithelial cells of the vaginal mucosa with a high degree of cornification. Vaginoscopy showed the typical pale and crenulated mucosal folds (oestrus). Haematological analysis indicated moderate anaemia and leukocytosis, and increased level of oestrogen. Ultrasound examination showed a mass located caudally to the kidney in the region of the right ovary. Abdominal and thoracic radiographs confirmed the findings and did not reveal metastases. Suspecting an ovarian tumour, we decided to perform a complete ovariohysterectomy. Once located, the right ovary presented an increased volume, irregular shape and reddish colour. Samples collected during the procedure were stained with haematoxylin and eosin and observed under optical microscope. The cells were characterized by a scant cytoplasm, a large vesicle type nucleus with coarsely granular chromatin and distinct cell borders. The neoplastic cells were remarkably similar to those of a testicular seminoma, allowing for the diagnosis of ovarian dysgerminoma. Two years after the ovariohysterectomy, the owner reported history of increased volume of the abdomen and lethargy. A second surgery was performed during which an irregular splenic mass was found. The morphological diagnosis was “splenic metastasis of dysgerminoma”. To the authors' knowledge, dysgerminoma related splenic metastasis was never described in the bitch before.",

There are many studies evaluating the effectiveness of the Ovsynch programme. However, few of them assess the impact of factors that can lead to a decrease in the pregnancy rate and thus, reduce the success of the Ovsynch programme. This review aims to examine the impact of both individual and environmental factors on the likelihood of pregnancy. The risk factors described include: the body condition, age, number and stage of lactation, production level, occurrence of diseases and postpartum complications, functional status of the ovaries, oestrous cycle phase, temperature, season and year, and program start-up after calving. Possible modifications of the Ovsynch programme are presented in order to increase its effectiveness and to determine the best time to start it. Additionally, attention was paid to pregnancy losses during the Ovsynch programme which ultimately decrease pregnancy rates. The impact of this many factors on the efficiency of the Ovsynch suggests the need to adjust the synchronization program each time to the individual situation of the herd.",

The animals were divided into two groups, group 1 (G1) with 30 obese adult dogs (2 to 8 years) and group 2 (G2) with 29 obese senior dogs (over 8 years old). The mean values of the erythrogram and platelet count parameters of both groups remained within the compared reference ranges except the red cell distribution width (RDW), whose values were lower than the reference ranges in both groups. A comparison of the values of erythrogram and platelet count of the groups indicated that the RDW and MPV (mean platelet volume) of G2 were higher than those of G1. As for the white blood cell count (WBC), only the number of band neutrophils exceeded the physiological limits for the species in both groups, with no significant difference in values between the age groups. The males in G2 showed a significantly higher mean eosinophil count than those in G1 and than the females of both groups. As for the frequency of findings, 90% of the animals in G1 and 68.96% in G2 showed left shift neutrophils (LSN), while 34.48% in G1 and 20% in G2 showed eosinophilia. It was concluded that, irrespective of age, obese animals presented no changes in erythrogram and platelet indices, and that their WBC may exhibit discrete LSN without leukocytosis.",

    "abstract": "Cow footrot in the Heilongjiang Province, northeast China is a problem resulting in lost production in agriculture. In this study, 200 swab samples from footrot lesions of naturally infected cows with odorous exudative inflammation and keratinous hoof separation at 10 farms were examined in the period from May 2016 to May 2017. Twenty cows from each farm were taken for sampling. The samples were examined for detectingthe presence of Dichelobacter nodosus ( D. nodosus ) and Fusobacterium necrophorum ( F. necrophorum ). Such detection was carried out using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR primers were designed to identify the lktA gene, which encodes a leukotoxin unique to F. necrophorum , and the fimA gene of D. nodosus . Of the 200 samples, 111 (55.5%) revealed the presence of F. necrophorum and 11 (5.5%) exhibited D. nodosus . The frequent finding of F. necrophorum in cow farms of Heilongjiang province, northeast China is noteworthy. The possibility of F. necrophorum and D. nodosus infection should be an important concern when controlling cow footrot in China.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether oral mucosa wounds in rats can be successfully treated with triamcinolone acetonide (TA), incorporated into liposomes. A round wound was inflicted on the oral mucosa of female Wistar rats divided into four groups of 12 animals. This wound was treated topically from day 1 with liposomes without the inclusion of TA and liposomes containing 0.01% or 0.05% TA. The wounds of the animals in the control group were not treated. Polymethyl metacrylate was used as an ointment for mixing in liposomes. The size of the wound was measured until day 6. The area of inflammatory infiltrate under the wound was evaluated by histopathology, the expression of iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) enzyme under the wound was evaluated by immunohistochemistry until day 6. On the sixth day of experiment, the size of the wound and the area of the inflammatory infiltrate was the smallest in the group receiving empty liposomes (EL). Expression of iNOS was the most reduced in the group receiving EL. We conclude that oral mucosa wounds can be successfully treated with liposomes, although the incorporated drug triamcinolone would not be the appropriate drug for treating wounds of traumatic origin.",

Twenty-six dogs with chronic gastrointestinal problems were included in the prospective study. Each research subject had their stomach, duodenum, ileum, and colon examined endoscopically. A histopathological examination of the obtained biopsy samples was then performed, excluding other potential diseases. Stool samples were collected and then examined for the presence of Campylobacter spp. To evaluate the relationship between Campylobacter spp. occurrence and the intensity of chronic enteropathy, patients were divided into two groups; animals in the first group presented with no to mild inflammation whereas research subjects in the second group suffered from moderate to severe inflammation. Subsequently, the patients were divided based on positive or negative test results for Campylobacter spp. cultures. No significant relationship between the presence of Campylobacter spp. in stool samples and chronic enteropathy was found. In contrast to other previously published papers, our study showed a lower occurrence of Campylobacter upsaliensis .",

Specific scFv antibody clone D5 was selected from the Tomlinson phagemid library and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography from the periplasmatic space of E. coli cells. The antibody was then characterized by sequencing and the ability to recognize the native virus N protein by Western blot and competitive ELISA. Pepscan analysis identified the position of the binding epitope between amino acids 62–84 of the N protein.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes of Doppler indices in the foetal aorta (FA), foetal vena cava (FVC), umbilical artery (UA), and uteroplacental artery (UPA) in pregnant queens, thereby advancing knowledge about Doppler findings in normal feline pregnancy. The study was conducted with 10 pregnant queens with known gestational age. Doppler ultrasonography was performed every three days beginning from the 21 st day to the 60 th day of pregnancy. The pulsatility index (PI) and resistance index (RI) of FA, FVC, UA and UPA were recorded during the D-USG examinations. Although a declining trend was seen in the mean RI of FA, a comparison with earlier sampling periods revealed that significant decreases ( P &lt; 0.05) did not occur until Days 30 and 60. While PI of FVC was relatively constant, RI varied througout pregnancy. The PI and RI of UPA values were significantly lower ( P &lt; 0.05) on Day 60 when compared to the first five sampling periods for PI and the first six sampling periods for RI. The study concludes that the decrease in UA indices is a precursor for delivery time in queens. However, there is a need for further comparative studies involving impaired pregnancies.",

Ten female donkeys were included in the study and were repeatedly rectally palpated and sonographically examined during the oestrous cycle. Samples were taken from the fossa clitoridis and around the cervix for microbiological examination. Each jenny was sampled twice, always at different stages of the cycle, both in the oestrus and in the dioestrus. In addition, samples from the endometrium were taken in oestrus for both microbiological and cytological examination. After collection, the samples were examined in a microbiological laboratory. There were 62 different species of microorganisms found belonging to 19 different bacterial genera. The presence of agents of mares’ infectious metritis Taylorella equigenitalis was not found in any of the samples. The outcome of our study is an initial mapping of the microbial colonization of the endometrium and the genital tract in jennies with correct formation of the perineal region. The hypothesis that the level of bacterial contamination was related to the oestrous cycle was not confirmed. The practical significance of the study lies mainly in the description of the composition, amount and changes of microbiota in healthy individuals during their oestrous cycle, which allows the evaluation of the risk of developing infection during the active oestrous cycle in connection with mating.",

    "abstract": "In November 2018, a horse owner from the Czech Republic experienced the loss of two of his stallions in consequence of probable poisoning. The affected animals were kept in the stable only. The mares, which were grazing on pasture during the day, were not affected. All the animals were fed the same type of feed. The day before the animals became sick, between 15:00 to 19:00 h the stable was not secured against the entry of strangers. When the mares were brought back to the stable and all animals were closed and locked for the night, no signs of health issues were observed. In the following morning, the two stallions were found in lateral recumbency with seizure attacks. Despite symptomatic treatment (infusion with saline, flunixine meglumine, activated charcoal) and applications of myorelaxants, the symptoms persisted until the afternoon, and the owner agreed with euthanasia. Based on the clinical signs and pathological examination, poisoning by pesticides was suspected. The results of toxicological analyses revealed that carbofuran, metaldehyde, and strychnine were not responsible for the poisoning as they were not detected in the samples. The only positive finding was a high aluminium concentration in the stomach content, liver and kidney samples. Based on the observed symptoms and the high aluminium concentration, it was presumed that aluminium phosphide could be the source of poisoning. As there was no evidence of the possession of such product by the horse breeder and the stable stayed unsupervised for a few hours, intentional poisoning cannot be excluded.",

    "abstract": "Septic arthritis is considered one of the most severe disorders that affect horses’ joints. Therapy is intended to eliminate the microorganisms that cause this infection. The intravenous administration of antibiotics is an easily performed technique, but there is no guarantee that the antibiotics will reach the joint milieu at high concentrations and remain elevated for a certain period of time. This study aimed to determine and compare the levels of gentamicin in the plasma and synovial fluid of healthy horses after intravenous administration for seven days. Five horses received 6.6 mg/kg intravenous gentamicin every 24 h for seven consecutive days. Blood and synovial fluid samples were collected from the right metacarpal-phalangeal joint before the start of the treatment (T0) and after 6 h (T6), 12 h (T12), and every 24 h during antibiotic therapy for seven days (D1 to D7). The levels of gentamicin in serum and synovial fluid were quantified by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The intravenous administration of 6.6 mg/kg of gentamicin, in horses, after a period of 24 h, promotes synovial fluid concentrations below the MIC of the drug, in spite of reaching high plasma concentrations of gentamicin, daily mean serum concentration which was 29-fold higher than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the drug. The intravenous administration every 24 h during seven consecutive days did not cause systemic side effects, such as hepatic or renal injury.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the viability time of horse venous blood samples kept at laboratory temperature (LT) and in water with ice (WI), to perform blood gas analysis. Eleven blood samples were collected in duplicates from 10 healthy horses. The samples were transported to the laboratory and subjected to one of the 24 h storage method. Each pair of syringes was distinctly kept at LT or submerged in WI. Blood gas tests were performed at times T0h, T1h, T2h, T3h, T4h, T5h, T6h, T8h, T10h, T12h and T24h after collection. Analyses of electrolytes were also performed from the same samples. A difference in blood pH was found between the treatments ( P &lt; 0.05). From T4h, pH decreased in samples kept at LT, but in WI, pH did not change. For partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2 ), a difference between treatments ( P &lt; 0.05) was noted starting at T8h. In samples kept at LT, pCO 2 increased; no changes occurred in samples stored in WI. There was a decrease in the base concentration beginning at T5h in samples kept at LT ( P &lt; 0.05), but no variation in samples kept in WI. These changes can be attributed to the erythrocyte metabolism, still active in vitro , which generates lactic acid from anaerobic glycolysis. The potassium concentration increased in samples kept in WI from T4h, with a gradual increase until T24h. Conservation of equine venous blood samples in WI is efficient in reducing cellular metabolism, thereby increasing the viability of samples for examination and interpretation of results.",

The minimum number of Aenolithic deer individuals was researched within this percentage by means of limb bones. By method of Klein and Kathryn Cruz-Uribe, 1987., the minimum number of deer individuals were established in each Aenolithic layer.

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the amounts of time that selected crossbreeds of Holstein (H), Red-Holstein (R), and Czech Fleckvieh (C) cattle spent chewing, eating, being physically active using a Vitalimetr 5P neck responder during the period around oestrus in all seasons of the year. Oestrus and the days preceding it greatly affected the times of events of increased activity, eating, and rumination. Eating and chewing times were longest for H cows, at 51–74%, and shortest for C cows, at &gt; 88%. The number of events of increased activity was highest (533.4 ± 8.94 events, P &lt; 0.01) for cows R 51–74%. Oestrus in dairy cows was manifested by decreases in the times of chewing and eating and the frequency of events of increased activity. Feeding time decreased by 8.01 min from the second day before oestrus to the day of oestrus. Rumination time also decreased from the second day before oestrus to the day of oestrus. Rumination time on the day of oestrus decreased by an average of 61.80 min but increased the next day by 33.39 min. In contrast, events of increased activity were highest on the day of oestrus (623 ± 7.68 events). Our findings on differences between breeds, lactation order, and months may contribute to the improvement of algorithms for detecting oestrus, thereby improving the economic status of farms.",

    "abstract": "The ventral slot technique is used to relieve neural compression secondary to intervertebral disc degeneration or disease. In the present study, the biomechanical properties of three different ventral surgical procedures in the rabbit C6–C7 vertebral motion unit (VMU) were assessed and compared with the intact C6–C7 VMU. The ventral slot procedure (slanted, full, or mini; n = 8/group) was performed on these cervical vertebrae. Normal spine torsion and flexion values were compared to those of spines subjected to slanted, full, and mini slot surgery. The slanted slot spines were the most stable, maintaining 70% of normal cervical spine strength, compared to 26% with the full slot and 30% with the mini slot. Regarding torsion, slanted slot spines showed 74% stability compared to the normal cervical spine, while the full slot and mini slot spines showed 58% and 62% stability, respectively. Flexion values were lower after all versions of the ventral slot procedure than in the normal spine, with the greatest flexion difference occurring after the full slot procedure (21% of the normal flexion value). The flexion values also differed significantly between the slanted and full spine groups, and all operated spines showing roughly 60% torsion rates compared with normal spines. The slanted slot maintains more stability in rabbit cervical spine than the other procedures. To our knowledge, this was the first study to examine biomechanical failure differences between the distinct versions of this ventral slot procedure.",

    "abstract": "Two bitches with a history of hypoluteoidism were treated by recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin (r-hCG) in repeated doses during early dioestrus. The level of progesterone increased, but the therapy led to hyperstimulation of the ovaries which resulted in ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), with subsequent development of oestrogen toxicity. This is the first case documenting OHSS in a canine after administration of r-hCG. Although manifested during dioestrus in our case report, the occurrence of OHSS is associated with similar administration of r-hCG to women. The described use of r-hCG is not appropriate for luteal insufficiency treatment, but seems to have a place in assisted reproduction technology because of its surprising effects. Further research of luteotrophic factors in bitches is warranted because of these unpredictable results. Lower doses and frequency of administration need to be considered for a better outcome.",

The biochemical indices analysed were potassium, total protein, glucose, lactate and creatinine. Effusion-to-blood concentration ratios of selected indices were obtained for higher data validity and this ratio was then compared between two groups: patients with gastrointestinal tract damage and patients without gastrointestinal tract damage. There were 11 dogs in the study group of patients with gastrointestinal tract damage and 18 dogs in the study group of patients without gastrointestinal tract damage. Subsequent statistical data analysis did not show any significant difference between these two groups in any of the selected indices.

A close correlation between gamma spectrometry determined by 137 Cs activity concentration in the meat and stomach wall (r = 0.984) was found in monitored Slovak wild boars with a low activity of 137 Cs . The transfer factors of the soil and the stomach content and the soil and the meat were approximately 0.07 at the median. The median transfer factor between the stomach content and the stomach wall is similar to that of the stomach wall and the meat (2.412 and 1.805). The mean value of 137 Cs activity concentration in the muscles of wild boars from the Czech Republic was 46.7 Bq·kg -1 . The mean value of 137 Cs activity concentration in the stomach wall was 23.7 Bq·kg -1 . The mutual correlation was r = 0.988. There was further correlation of 137 Cs activity concentration between the heart and the diaphragm (r = 0.977), the heart and the tongue (r = 0.902), and the heart and the lungs (r = 0.906). Based on the results from Slovakia and the Czech Republic, there is hope that it will be possible to use a sample from the stomach wall to determine the activity concentration of 137 Cs in meat, thereby replacing the commonly used and highly valued top side sample. In practice, monitoring soil contamination to predict the meat contamination of wild boars is more important than monitoring elements of the food chain. The potassium-caesium coefficient reached 5.57 in the muscles and 17.25 in the stomach wall.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the effects of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) supplemented in the Ovsynch protocol on pregnancy per timed artificial insemination (P/TAI) in cyclic dairy cows. All cows (n = 383) included in the study received the Ovsynch protocol. The cows in FSH3 (n = 92), FSH4 (n = 88), and FSH3&amp;4 (n = 91) were administered 20 mg FSH on day 3, or day 4, or both on days 3 and 4 of the protocol, respectively, whereas the control group (n = 112) did not receive any FSH treatment. The mean follicle number at TAI and ovulation number after TAI were similar among the FSH groups. However, the mean follicular size was smaller (~14.9 mm, P = 0.02) in FSH4 compared to the other groups (~15.9 mm). Pregnancy/TAI of the FSH4 group on day 31 (59.1%) and day 62 (53.4%) was higher than those of other groups on day 31 (45.5% in control, 45.7% in FSH3, and 46.2% in FSH3&amp;4) and day 62 (42.9% in control, 43.5% in FSH3, and 40.7% in FSH3&amp;4), but the difference was non-significant. Likewise, FSH4 (62.7%) had more ( P = 0.05) P/TAI than the other groups (48.6% in control, 47.7% in FSH3, and 49.4% in FSH3&amp;4) in synchronized cows. The cows which responded to the first gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) of Ovsynch in the FSH4 group (64.8%) had higher ( P &lt; 0.02) P/AI rate than the responding control cows (44.6%). We concluded that application of FSH on day 4 in cyclic cows which were responsive to the Ovsynch protocol can yield higher pregnancy rates, but more studies are needed to better demonstrate this potential effect.",

In both dogs, computed tomography angiography revealed a single extrahepatic portosystemic shunt with the absence of the portal vein cranial to the shunt origin. Intraoperative mesenteric portography (IOMP) was performed after temporary complete occlusion of the shunt, revealing the portal branches faintly opacified with contrast medium. A cellophane band was applied around the shunt vessel without intraoperative attenuation. Postoperatively, both the dogs showed significant clinical improvement and the portal veins, not observed on preoperative ultrasonography, were visualized on postoperative ultrasonography. This study suggests the efficacy of IOMP, enabling the appropriate surgical procedure to be determined.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of the Ringer B. Braun solution on stallion epididymal sperm viability and motility during liquid storage for 72 h at 4 °C and at 20 °C. Eight stallions (3–10 years old) were used in the study. Sperm from the cauda epididymis was harvested immediately after routine castration. The sperm from epididymis was washed out and diluted with Ringer B. Braun solution and with a commercial semen extender which was used as a control. Samples from each horse were divided into two parts: one part of samples was stored at 4 ± 1 °C as recommended for the commercial semen extender, the other one was stored at 20 ± 1 °C. Sperm viability, motility, and pH were checked one hour after collection and dilution, and after 24, 48 and 72 h of incubation. The results of sperm viability, subjective and progressive sperm motility showed slightly higher results in semen samples diluted with Ringer B. Braun solution in one hour compared to the commercial extender, by 2.40 ± 0.49% for viability ( P &gt; 0.05), by 0.30 ± 9.92% for subjective motility ( P &gt; 0.05) and by 5.70 ± 6.07% for progressive motility ( P &gt; 0.05).

Seven client-owned dogs with severe PH were recruited prospectively and given low-dose masitinib orally, 3 mg/kg body weight (approximately one-fourth of the recommended antineoplastic dosage), q24h, for 123–928 days. Examinations were performed prior to masitinib administration, as well as 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months later. At 1–12 months, low-dose masitinib significantly reduced systolic pulmonary arterial pressure ( P &lt; 0.05 or 0.01) and dramatically improved clinical symptoms. Low-dose masitinib treatment improved right ventricular function indicators such as right atrium/aorta ratio, maximum tricuspid regurgitation velocity, right ventricular Tei index, and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, without worsening left ventricular function indicators. These findings suggest that low-dose masitinib may be effective as an adjunctive therapeutic for chronic heart failure in dogs with PH and may increase the survival of PH dogs.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate polymorphisms of DGAT1 , FABP , OLR1 and ATP1A1 genes using PCR-DNA sequencing, and to associate these genetic structures to changes in metabolic biochemical markers and milk composition indicators in a total of 90 dairy cows of the Holstein, Simmental, and Brown Swiss breeds (30 cows each). PCR was carried out for amplification of 411-bp of DGAT1 , 525-bp of FABP , 582-bp of OLR1 , and 300-bp of ATP1A1 genes. Three breeds’ nucleotide sequence variations in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detailed by DNA sequencing analysis. Chisquare analysis showed that the distribution of all discovered SNPs varied significantly ( P &lt; 0.001). Biochemical indices in cow’s serum revealed no significant difference in serum total protein, albumin, and total cholesterol among the three breeds. However, triglyceride showed a significant increase in Simmental compared to either Holsteins or Brown Swiss, while the highest mean value of triiodothyronine (T3) and tetraiodothyronine (T4) was detected in Holstein dairy cows The milk composition indicators analysis revealed that milk protein, sugar, and density were significantly higher in Holsteins than both Simmental and Brown Swiss. Meanwhile, milk fat and total solids revealed a significantly higher increase in Simmental than both brown Swiss and Holstein. As a result, the metabolic biochemical markers profile along with the identified SNPs could be used as a candidate and a reference guide for effective characterization of the Holstein, Simmental, and Brown Swiss breeds, leading to the creation of a marker-assisted selection system for production traits in dairy cattle breeds.",

We compared the treatment of equine gastric squamous mucosa ulcers by omeprazol and by nutraceutical herbal mixture PREVUL (Dzsar Ltd., FitoCavallo, Hungary). A total of 36 horses, 18 geldings, 15 non-pregnant mares and 3 stallions were diagnosed with Equine Squamous Gastric Disease (ESGD) by gastroscopy. Horses were randomly divided into three groups. The first group was treated with 4 mg/kg omeprazole paste (Peptizole, Norbrook, United Kingdom) per os once daily on empty stomach for 28 days. The second group received 20 g of pulverized herbal mixture PREVUL twice daily in cracked oats for 28 days. The third experimental group received 2 mg/kg omeprazole per os once daily on empty stomach followed by 15 g of PREVUL mixed with cracked oats twice daily for 28 days. Ten healthy horses were used as control to evaluate the palatability and voluntary intake of PREVUL. Control gastroscopy was performed afted 30 days. The use of PREVUL alone P &lt; 0.05 or in combination with omeprazole paste P &lt; 0.01 appears to improve the healing of gastric ulcers in horses.",

    "abstract": "This study focused on determining the success of inducing endogenous progesterone source (by formation of accessory corpus luteum) by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration on day 4 post timed artificial insemination (TAI) and on evaluating the effect of the day of hCG administration (day 4 or 5 post TAI) on pregnancy rates in repeat breeder cows according to their responses to hCG administrations. Non-pregnant cyclic lactating Holstein dairy cows with more than three services despite no clinical reproductive abnormalities were enrolled in the study. All cows (n = 192) received the Ovsynch protocol (GnRH-7d-PGF 2α -56h-GnRH-16/18h-TAI) and hCG administration (1500 IU, i.m.) was performed in group hCG4 (n = 64) on day 4 and in group hCG5 (n = 68) on day 5 post TAI. The control group (CON, n = 60) did not receive any hCG treatment. The responses (ovulation rate) to hCG (~64%) were similar on days 4 and 5 post TAI. Pregnancy per AI (P/AI) at 31 days was similar among the groups (48.3% in CON, 48.4% in hCG4, and 42.6% in hCG5). Regardless of the day of the treatment (hCG4 + hCG5), the cows had an ovulatory response to hCG (54.1%), and a greater P/AI ( P = 0.007) at 31 days than those without a response (29.8%). The administration of hCG on either day 4 or 5 post TAI did not increase overall pregnancy rates, however, the ovulatory response to the post TAI hCG administration on day 4 improved fertility in repeat breeder cows. Further studies are needed with a larger number of animals to reveal this potentiallly beneficial effect.",

The aim of the study was to determine the frequency of eosinophilic infiltration into the endometrium in chronically infertile mares and to determine factors conducive to this type of changes. A total of 117 samples of endometrium were collected from infertile mares, 15 samples of endometrium were collected from maiden mares, and all were evaluated histologically. Eosinophilic infiltration of the endometrium was found in 59 mares; in 10 mares, eosinophiles were the predominant cells that had infiltrated the endometrium. The probability of eosinophilic infiltration of the endometrium increases with the age of the mare and with a higher score of endometrial degeneration. The simultaneous infiltration of the endometrium by polymorphonuclear cells and mononuclear cells, in mares being in oestrus, and in mares having fluid in the uterus, also increased the probability. In the group of young mares, eosinophilic infiltration of the endometrium was not detected. Eosinophilic infiltration of the endometrium increases in chronically infertile mares with age and with the presence of other abnormalities observed in the endometrium. We suspect that presence of eosinophils in endometrial tissue together with other abnormalities can be considered as reducing factor for future fertility, however, this hypothesis should be evaluated critically.",

An early radiographic sign of sequestrum formation (discrete changes in the outer cortex) was not seen after the injury. Six weeks later, the wound was completely covered with vascularized, healthy-appearing bed of granulation tissue, which was prepared for grafting using the punch technique. A reinforced bandage was applied for the following 7 weeks; the grafts were accepted by granulation tissue. The horse was discharged 20 weeks after admission and the owners were advised to maintain stall rest with hand walking for two weeks. Four years later the owner reported that the wound had completely healed with a good cosmetic outcome and the horse was being used in a carriage.",

    "abstract": "Proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPJ) arthrodesis is performed commonly in horses with chronic osteoarthritis of the pastern joint or in cases of acute traumatic injury to the pastern, in which the weight-bearing bony column must be restored. Chronic osteoarthritis of the pastern joint is a frequent cause of lameness in the equine athlete and is evidenced by chronic lameness which is supported radiographically by periosteal proliferation and loss of joint space. The conventional method of joint fusion involves the opening of the joint, debridement of the joint cartilage, osteostixis of the subchondral bone plate and application of either lag screws or plate. This case report describes the successful treatment of chronic proliferative ossified osteoarthritis and periarthritis of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the front limb of two mares by performing simple percutaneous drilling destruction of the articular cartilage and stabilization with the application of three lag screws. After three years of conservative treatment with local corticosteroids, the mares exhibited non-weight-bearing lameness. Radiographs revealed extensive periarticular new bone formation over the proximal interphalangeal joint. Three 4.5 mm transcortical bone screws were placed in the lag fashion. A lower limb fiberglass cast was applied in both cases for 3 days. The antibiotic and analgesic protocol included gentamicin, penicillin, and flunixin meglumine for several days. Control radiographic examination after a period of 6 and 12 months showed reduction of the periarticular bone tissue. Both of the mares in this case study successfully returned to pleasure riding after undergoing forelimb arthrodesis.",

    "abstract": "The aims of this study were to investigate the effects of three different concentrations of the Pu-erh tea extract (PTE) on the contractile activity of the isolated mouse duodenum and explore their mechanism. The contraction amplitude and frequency of the isolated mouse duodenum were inhibited by all three concentrations of PTE. The high-concentration PTE significantly ( P &lt; 0.01) inhibited the promotion effects of acetylcholine chloride or BayK8644 on the amplitude and frequency of intestinal contraction, which were comparable to those of atropine sulphate and verapamil hydrochloride, respectively. The results of UV-Vis and ELISA showed that the content of methionine-enkephalin (Met-ENK) in the PTE-treated groups was decreased to varying degrees; contrarily, the activities of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), total nitric oxide synthase, and the content of nitric oxide were increased to different degrees. The results suggest that PTE can inhibit the contraction of the isolated mouse duodenum, and the mechanism of action is that PTE can not only inhibit the signal transduction pathways of AC-cAMP-PKA and PLC-IP 3 -Ca 2+ , but also the Ca 2+ signal systems mediated by G protein-coupled M receptors through the myenteric plexus. By reducing the release of Met-ENK from the motor neurons of the myenteric plexus, the GTP-cAMP-PKK signalling pathway and the Ca 2+ signalling system mediated by G protein-coupled delta receptors were inhibited. By increasing the TH activity of the motor neurons in the myenteric plexus, the norepinephrine content was increased, thereby the AC-cAMP-PKA signal transduction pathway mediated by G protein-coupled β receptors was activated. This study increases knowledge regarding the medicinal value of the Pu-erh tea.",

The cytotoxic effect of Aeruginosin-865 (Aer), capsaicin (Cap), resveratrol (Res) and their combinations was evaluated on normal hepatocytes (AML) and tumour cells derived from livers (Hepa) and kidneys (Renca). Various concentrations from 25 to 200 μM of tested substances were used. Only the Aer + Res combination and a low concentration of Res had a significant cytotoxic effect on Hepa and Renca and no significant cytotoxic effect on AML. Cap had a significant cytotoxic effect on all tested cell lines, but tumour-derived cells showed higher resistance than AML. A significantly increased cytotoxicity was found in the combination of Cap + Res compared to each substance alone. All types of cells showed similar sensitivity to the cytotoxic effect of Cap + Res. Because of a possible hepatotoxic effect, we recommend further investigations into side-effects of Cap + Res. No cytotoxic effect was described in Cap + Aer or in Aer alone. Only substances with a significant cytotoxic effect on tumour cells and no cytotoxic effect on normal cells can be potentially used in anticancer treatment. According to the results, only Res or the combination of Aer + Res can be recommended for further evaluation in the process of new anticancer drug development. The potential hepatotoxic effect of Cap + Res can significantly limit the utilisation of these substances in anticancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "The study deals with the influence of haemolysis on the results of vitamin E determination in plasma (serum) in cattle. Although nowadays specific High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) techniques are used almost exclusively for the determination of vitamin E, this indicator is also influenced by haemolysis. This occurs in the pre-analytical phase due to the fact that iron contained in haemoglobin is able to catalyze peroxidation reactions. Subsequently, changes occur mainly in polyunsaturated fatty acids in the lipoprotein components of serum/plasma. The vitamin E present inhibits this process, as a result of which its concentration is reduced. The experiment was performed by preparing model samples with a defined degree of haemolysis by adding haemolysate to the centrifuged plasma in the range of ca 0–12 g/l, i.e. mild to severe haemolysis. After 4 h of incubation at room temperature, the vitamin E concentration was determined by the HPLC method. Haemolysis was found to reduce the test result; mild one (approximately up to 2 g/l) non-significantly, medium and severe haemolysis by up to tens of percent, which warrants repeated sampling. False reductions in results will not endanger the patient’s health, but economic losses may occur due to unnecessary check-ups and increased vitamin E supplementation.",

RG-tannin in the dose of 50 mg.kg-I (but not 25 mg.kg-I) inhibited significantly yawning induced with apomorphine (0.1 mg.kg-I), but failed to decrease yawning to a significant extent in rats treated with phrsostigmine (0.075 mg.kg-I). RG-tannin given intraperitoneally in mice in the dose of25 mg.kg- and 50 mg.kg-I body weight increased statistically significantly the time of immobility in forced swimming test in comparison with mice treated only with saline. All these findings indicate that RG-tannin has interesting neuroleptic properties, which could be useful also in veterinary medicine.",

The aim of the experiment was to observe the effect of increased gravitational field (2 g) on the synthesis and degradation rates of skeletal muscles proteins in Japanese quail. The observations in vivo were compared with results obtained on the isolated muscles. The rates of synthesis and degradation of mixed proteins in m. biceps brachii and m. iliotibialis anterior were estimated. It was shown. that the protein synthesis rates only in in vivo experiment were affected. A decrease of protein degradation rates in both conditions were observed. 2 g hypergravity, protein synthesis and degradative rates, effect in vivo, in vitro For determination of the capacity of muscles to cope with the load of gravitational stress it is important to understand the influence of altered gravity. Our earlier results (G a f 0 et al. 1988; Jan k e I a et al. 1991) confirmed that altered gravity caused changes in muscle mass connected with changes in protein level and composition. It is anticipated that muscle growth or atrophy is regulated by the changes in protein synthesis or degradation (Van den bur g h 1987). We paid attention to quantification of these processes. To eliminate the possible effect of neurohumoral mechanisms. the observations in vivo were compared with results of experiment in which isolated muscles were used. Materiats and Methods In vivo experiment 42 days old japanese quail cockerels were used. The control birds were kept under normal husbandry conditions (24 hours lighting. ambient temperature 21 ·C, commercial mash ad libitum). The experimental treatment of increased gravitational field (2 g) was administered for 144 hours continually by means of centrifuge. Parameters are given in Gato et al. (1988). During the centrifugation the feed supply. lighting and temperature were the same as in the control group. Centrifugation was interrupted only for a few minutes one hour before finishing the centrifugation. the label C14 arginine was peritoneally injected. Breast (m. supracoracoides) and thigh (m. superficialis fibularis) muscles were removed and analysed for protein (L 0 wry et al. 1957), RNA and DNA (Canev and Markov 1960) contents. The parts of muscles were homogenised in 10% trichloroacetic acid and the sediments were hydrolysed. In supernatants as in hydrolysates the arginine concentration and its radioactivity after thin layer chromatography were estimated. The arginine measurement was according the method of Sakaguchi (Devenyi and Gergely 1974). The radioactivity was measured by means of Packard TriCarb liquid scintillation system. In vitro experiment The wing (m. biceps brachii) and tight (m. iliotibialis anterior) muscles of 42 days old Japanese quail-cockerels. were incubated in the Krebs-Henseleit solution bubled with carbon dioxide oxygene mixture and centrifuged to 2 g for one hour. For synthetic rate measurement the C14 arginine was added into the solution. The muscles were analysed for arginine concentration and radioactivity by the methods mentioned above. For the determination of the degradafive rate the inhibitor of protein synthesis (actinomycine) was added into incubation solution. The estimation of degradative rate was established on the measurement of loosed thyrosine in that solution. The thyrosine measurement was according the method ofU denfriend and Cooper (1952). The determination of protein synthesis rates were based on the calculations of the specific activities of protein bound and free arginine. in breast and thigh muscle in first experiment or in isolated wing and thigh muscle in the second. Protein degradation was calculated as a difference between synthetic and growth rates (M u ram a t suet al. 1985) in in vivo experiment. In isolated muscles the determination of degradative rate was established on the measurement of loosed thyrosine after inhibition of protein synthesis.",

A model of human biological life support system (BLSS) was created with a photoautotrophic link including unicellular algae and higher plants having an equal oxygen production. This system model supported the vital activities of two people at the biomass regeneration of 92% from that consumed by them. The plant cultures studied were wheat grown on 11.25 m2 (of a total 15 m2) and several vegetable species. The total photosynthetic productivity of the plants was high, stable over the studied time span, and independent on the composition of the system. However, the grain productivity of wheat decreased periodically, and during certain harvests it decreased to almost zero. A detailed analysis revealed that this decrease was not caused by any of the system's adjacent links as a similar decrease in yield was also found in the control period with an autonomous growth of the plants in a closed volume of a chamber. Inclusion of bigher plants into BLSS led to a considerable improvement od food supply regeneration for man as compared to the previous model with only 26% regeneration effect. This inclusion did not exert any marked effect upon the general closure of the cycle. However, the biological value of the food for man was increased dramatically. This improvement is the main goal of designing and operating such BLSS systems. Regeneration. ecosystem. photosynthesis, photoautotroph link, unicellular algae. higher p.lants The prospect of long-teon existence of man outside the Earth's biosphere (interplanetary flights, lunar and planetary bases) is connected with creating an artificial environment with the help of regenerating it from the products of vital activity. This environment must correspond to the evolutionarily conditioned biological needs of the humans and to provide their lives for generations. The fact of adaptive biology shows that the full-value environment for humans and other terrestrial organisms is the natural environment of the Earth. In order to recreate that environment artificially it is necessary to reproduce the mechanisms existing on Earth, i. e. to foon closed ecological systems including man. The lack of our knowledge about the natural environment of the humans prevents us from reproducing it by non-biological means, even if it were possible. The investigation of the problem of creating biological life-support systems (BLSS) of man began as early as in the 60ies. By the present time, experimental BLSS models have been created with different structures and different degrees of the cycle closure. , The creation of the systems was based on the ecological concept according to which strategy and tactics were worked out providing the organisms and populations were studied and then united into biocenoses, including also humans. The main method of solving the problem was the method of experimental modelling from the simple to the complex (Rashevski 1966).",

A.: Avian Reproductive Function under a Combined Effect of Phytoadaptogens and Some Factors ofa Space Flight. Acta vet. Bmo 1996.65: 87-92. Adult quail Cotumix cotumix japonica were used as test objects. A set of factors which had an impact on the avians included adaptogens supplemented to quail's dry diet and simulated space flight effects (shock and vibration) known for their physiological implications. Results of the experiment showed that administration of the composite phytoadaptogen following extreme physical impacts had a favorable effect on japanese quail ability to lay eggs. Ingredients of the composite adaptogen. the chosen dose and the pattern of adaptogen administration appear to block stress reactions to these physical impacts. Physical stimulation, stress, egg production, phytoadaptogens,food Rat experiments in biosatellites showed that mammals of this type are able to adapt to the conditions of a space flight. Nevertheless, such reversible functional changes as specific, related to weightlessness, and non-specific, related to stress development (F e d 0 r 0 v 1967; Fogt 1981; Philpott 1985; Plakhuta-Plakhutina 1979) were discovered in a number of organs and systems. The authors think that the share of such a non-specific component as stress in the reaction of the organism to the flight factors is very big and the fact that stress is responsible for a larger part of functional and structural changes occurring under these conditions cannot be discarded. Undoubtedly, the results of animal experiments with simulated space conditions and a modified stress component will be interesting to analyze the mechanism of the effect of space flight factors. A 9-day experiment Incubator-2 with Japanese quail carried out in 1990 in conditions of weightlessness at the orbital station Mir showed the possibility of maintaining adult birds in weightlessness and also that these conditions had no effect on such fundamental processes as growth and development of birds. Nevertheless, all three female quail stopped laying eggs. Similar results were observed in a laboratory group of simultaneous control exposed to mechanical stimulation simulating factors of a space flight. Evidently start loads and dynamic weightlessness in the space and physical stimulation in land experiments were the reason why the quail were unable to lay eggs. Autopsy of birds of these two groups revealed ovarian and oviducal hypotrophy and absence of mature follicles. These changes were reversible: female quail from Mir station started laying eggs 8 days after landing and laboratory birds resumed egg production 7 days after stress stimulation was interrupted. Their productivity remained on a pre-experiment level. At present there are numerous pharmaceuticals (synthetic, herbal, of animal origin) regulating stress reactions in the organism and increasing its resistance to various harmful factors. Phytoadaptogens are widely known to have a broad spectrum of pharmacological effect (Brekhman 1957,1968). Herbal drugs included into a group ofphytoadaptogens have some advantages: absence of toxicity and a stage of a negative aftereffect, broad",

The implementation of human Biological Life Support System (BLSS) in the conditions of weightlessness requires a broader, ecological approach to the analysis of manifestations of weightlessness in living systems as compared to the traditional morphophysiological approach common for gravitational biology. For a stable functioning of BLSS, as an ecological system the most decisive are superorganism levels of biological organization from population to ecosystem. On these levels, the weightlessness effects may manifest themselves even if no primary biological effects on the organism level are noted. In this paper, possible weightlessness effects on living systems are discussed as well as the consequences of these effects. On different levels of organization of the living matter, from a cell to an ecosystem, weightlessness can exert different effects and these may come to the fore by different mechanisms. Ontogeny, ecology, unicellular organisms, quail, gravitational biology, population, biocenosis Modem gravitational biology directed mostly at the study of separate organisms and their subordinate levels (cellular and subcellular) gives no answer to the question of possible existence under the conditions of weightlessness of whole ecological systems where the levels above that of organism are decisive, i. e. the popUlation, biocenotic, and ecosystem levels. This inspired us to consider again, if only theoretically, the general problem of biological or other significance of weightlessness, of its possible influence mechanisms and points of impingement on different hierarchic levels of living systems. At the present stage it is important to state that the notion of the biological significance of weightlessness is essentially ambiguous. At various levels of biological organization, from the single organism to the ecosystem, weightlessness can make itself felt in different ways, and its effects can be carried out by qualitatively different mechanisms. The ideas generated by this analysis are schematically presented in Fig. 1. The first way - a direct, primary influence of weightlessness on elementary biological processes, such as metabolism, development, growth, proliferation at the cell and unicellular organisms levels - has not received a convincing confirmation, in spite of many-years efforts in this field. The conclusion about the absence of any specific effect of weightlessness on these main manifestations of life becomes more and more obvious. The very possibility of such an effect has no theoretical grounds yet (P a r f yon 0 v 1988). The second way of influence is not immediate, but performed through the change of gravitationally dependent physiological functions of an organism where they can manifest themselves. Here we mean the change of such functions as gravireception and the spatial orientation, haemodynamics, motor function and the connected with it processes of water-salt exchange of the body. The majority of information in this field have been received by vast research of long-duration space flights of man which have shown not only the facts of weightlessness influence, but also the mechanisms of their origin, carried out through the gravitationally dependent physiological functions. Thus, the widely known facts of weightlessness influence on the level of an adult organism do not present its primary effects, but",

Bmo 1996,65: 11-17. For the first time, vegetation of plants of radish and cabbage from a seed to the harvest age was performed in the conditions of space flight. The duration of the experiment was 54 days. The growth and development of the plants lagged behind the Earth control, and the harvest was by 2-5 times lower than in the control. The radish plants formed roots. Some deviations were found in the plant metabolism. At a practically similar composition of the biomass of the experiment and control plants, the experimental ones manifested some differences in the fractional composition of several compounds (nitrogen, phosphorus, carbohydrates, lipids) at the account of decrease of compounds playing the primary role in the energy exchange of the cell. A tendency was noticed towards a decrease of potassium content in the cells of the experiment plants. For other biogenic elements (iron, manganese, copper, zinc) there were no differences between the experiment and control. The obtained results did not show any difference in the plant metabolism which could testify to its impairment resulting in the death of the plants or impossibility of maintaining trophic connections in the future life support systems. Conservatory, radish, cabbage, biogenic elements, pigments, metabolism The study of growth and development of plants in the conditions of space flight began more than 30 years ago. By the present time, a vast experimental material has been gathered, which is generalized and discussed in the monograph by Parfyonov (1988). He wrote: If we limit ourselves by the processes described in terms of molecular biology, biochemistry and genetics, we should conclude that the elementary biological processes in plants go normally in the conditions of weightlessness. It has been shown that all the stages of plant development may take place normally in weightlessness: germination of seeds and formation of initial organs, differentiation and formation of somatic tissues, laying of the generative cells, differentiation of the generative cells, blooming, fertilization, embryogenesis and ripening of the seeds. Such conclusions were made from the results of experiments made with different plants and in different times by means of questioning of various stages of ontogenesis in the conditions of space flight. Only the results of the experiment with the tube culture of Arabidopsis allow to hope that it is really so. In this experiment, made on board the station Salyut-7, it was possible to perform the whole cycle of individual development (M e r k is and La uri n a vic h u s 1983). Growing plants in the conditions of space flight presents a number of difficulties. Usually, plants perish at the stage of early or late sprouts due to the damage of the root system. The roots are the most sensitive and vulnerable organs of the plants, they are most closely connected with the conditions of the environment, that is why they are adapted to exclusively stable conditions (P a r f yon 0 v 1988).
