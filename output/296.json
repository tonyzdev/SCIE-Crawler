    "abstract": "Advancing technology has made detecting fetal abnormalities in the first and second trimesters a reality. Few families are prepared for the difficult decisions that must be made if their unborn children are diagnosed with a life-limiting condition. Expectant parents are compelled to make decisions on the basis of limited options. A systematic review of the literature is presented with an aim to inform clinicians of parental experiences and outcomes after diagnosis of a fetal anomaly. The review focused on patients given a diagnosis for fetal anomalies for the 40-year period from 1970 to 2010 by using the key words such as fetal anomaly, congenital malformations, pregnancy termination, perinatal palliative care, and perinatal hospice. Regardless of the option taken, women often experienced intense grief reactions. Both giving birth to a child with a life-limiting condition and termination of pregnancy for fetal anomaly can be emotionally traumatic life events, both associated with psychological morbidity. Nonaggressive obstetric management, allowing natural birth without life-sustaining therapeutics, is an option for families. Couples presented with a coordinated perinatal palliative care model may opt to continue their pregnancy. Families who experienced perinatal hospice/palliative care report positive feedback, but more research is needed to explore the psychological outcomes of this choice.",

    "abstract": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common cause of gastrointestinal-related morbidity and mortality in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Its onset is sudden and the smallest, most premature infants are the most vulnerable. Necrotizing enterocolitis is a costly disease, accounting for nearly 20% of NICU costs annually. Necrotizing enterocolitis survivors requiring surgery often stay in the NICU more than 90 days and are among those most likely to stay more than 6 months. Significant variations exist in the incidence across regions and units. Although the only consistent independent predictors for NEC remain prematurity and formula feeding, others exist that could increase risk when combined. Awareness of NEC risk factors and adopting practices to reduce NEC risk, including human milk feeding, the use of feeding guidelines, and probiotics, have been shown to reduce the incidence of NEC. The purpose of this review is to examine the state of the science on NEC risk factors and make recommendations for practice and research.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE To examine the issue of pain assessment in infants by acquiring all available published pain assessment tools and evaluating their reported reliability, validity, clinical utility, and feasibility. DESIGN AND METHODS A systematic integrative review of the literature was conducted using the following databases: MEDLINE and CINAHL (through February 2004), and Health and Psychosocial Instruments, and Cochrane Systematic Reviews (through 2003). MeSH headings searched included \"pain measurement,\" with limit of \"newborn infant\"; \"infant newborn\"; and \"pain perception.\" SUBJECTS Thirty-five neonatal pain assessment tools were found and evaluated using predetermined criteria. The critique consisted of a structured comparison of the classification and dimensions measured. Further, the population tested and reports of reliability, validity, clinical utility, and feasibility were reviewed. RESULTS Of the 35 measures reviewed, 18 were unidimensional and 17 were multidimensional. Six of the multidimensional measures were published as abstracts only, were not published at all, or the original work could not be obtained. None of the existing instruments fulfilled all criteria for an ideal measure; many require further psychometric testing. CONCLUSIONS When choosing a pain assessment tool, one must also consider the infant population and setting, and the type of pain experienced. The decision should be made after carefully considering the existing published options. Confidence that the instrument will assess pain in a reproducible way is essential, and must be demonstrated with validity and reliability testing. Using an untested instrument is not recommended, and should only occur within a research protocol, with appropriate ethics and parental approval. Because pain is a multidimensional phenomenon, well-tested multidimensional instruments may be preferable.",

Despite the benefits, the incidence and duration of breastfeeding preterm infants continues to be less than that of full-term infants. The lower incidence is probably related to breastfeeding challenges that preterm infants and parents face, including establishing and maintaining a milk supply and transitioning from gavage feeding to breastfeeding. In order to increase the incidence and duration of breastfeeding preterm infants, researchers must examine breastfeeding experiences longitudinally. This way, researchers and clinicians can begin to understand the barriers to breastfeeding at various time periods in the breastfeeding experience and begin implementing strategies to remove these barriers.",

Because of the nature of this highly specialized form of nursing, NICU nurses can experience high levels of psychologic and physical stress. Burnout is a response to workplace stress that results in emotional and mental exhaustion, depersonalization, and decreased sense of personal accomplishment. Job satisfaction, emotional support, and self-care are important components for preventing burnout in staff. Therefore, the implications regarding practice and nurse burnout in the NICU are clear. It is the responsibility of both individual nurses and administrative leaders to take the necessary steps to prevent nurse burnout. Preventing this phenomenon in the NICU can lead to better retention and recruitment rates and delivery of safe neonatal care.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Preterm infants frequently experience oral feeding difficulties due to underdeveloped oral motor skills and the lack of coordination of sucking, swallowing, and respiration. The infants' ability to consume all feedings orally while maintaining physiologic stability and weight gain is necessary for their discharge. Therefore, difficulty with oral feeding leads to longer hospital stays and higher costs. For example, with more than half a million of premature infants born each year, a 3-day decrease in hospital stay would save more than 2 billion dollars annually. There is a need for evidenced-based interventions that facilitate development of oral-motor skills, leading to improved oral feeding, thus shortening hospital stays and lowering costs. The purpose of this research was to test the newly developed Premature Infant Oral Motor Intervention (PIOMI) beginning at 29 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA), before oral feedings were introduced, to determine whether the prefeeding intervention would result in a shorter transition from gavage to total oral feedings and a shorter length of hospital stay (LOS). The PIOMI is a 5-minute oral motor intervention that provides assisted movement to activate muscle contraction and provides movement against resistance to build strength. The focus of the intervention is to increase functional response to pressure and movement and control of movements for the lips, cheeks, jaw, and tongue. The cheeks (internal and external), lips, gums, tongue, and palate were stimulated per specific protocol with finger stroking. Subjects: A total of 19 infants from 1 level III NICU born between 26 and 29 weeks PMA: 10 in the experimental group and 9 in the control group. Design: A randomized, blinded, clinical trial was conducted to examine outcomes related to the newly developed PIOMI. Methods: Beginning at 29 weeks PMA (and before the introduction of oral feeding), the experimental group received the PIOMI for 5 minutes per day for 7 consecutive days. The control group received a sham intervention to keep staff and parents blinded to the infants' group assignment. Physiological and behavioral stabilities were continually assessed throughout the intervention. A chart review was then conducted to compare the transition from gavage feeding to total oral feedings between the experimental and control group, as well as LOS. Results: The PIOMI was well tolerated by 29-week PMA infants, as evidenced by physiological and behavioral cues. Infants who received the once-daily PIOMI transitioned from their first oral feeding to total oral feedings 5 days sooner than controls (P = .043) and were discharged 2.6 days sooner than controls. Conclusion: This pilot work supports further study on the use of the PIOMI with preterm infants to enhance oral-feeding skills and decrease LOS.",

    "abstract": "Moral distress is a significant problem for nurses (RNs). It has physical, emotional, and psychological sequelae and a negative impact on the quality, quantity, and cost of patient care. Moral distress leads to loss of moral integrity and job dissatisfaction and is a major cause of burnout and RNs leaving the profession. The majority of research has been carried out with RNs working in acute care, adult inpatient settings, especially critical care areas. Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) RNs confront ethically and morally challenging situations on a regular basis. There are limited data clarifying their moral distress.The purpose of this study was to describe the moral distress of RNs working in NICUs and to identify the situations that are associated with their moral distress.What are the intensity and frequency of moral distress in NICU RNs, what situations are associated with moral distress in NICU RNs, and what personal characteristics are correlated with moral distress in NICU RNs?This descriptive, correlational study was conducted with RNs in the level III NICUs of a healthcare system in the northeastern United States. Participation was voluntary and anonymous. A convenience sample of RNs completed a demographic data sheet and the Moral Distress Scale Neonatal-Pediatric Version. Data were collected during October 2008. Ninety-four of 196 eligible RNs (48%) participated in the study.As a whole, the subjects did not perceive that the situations described in the instrument occurred frequently and did not cause great distress. Subjects' individual scores displayed wide variations for all dimensions of moral distress ranging from low to high, indicating that individual RNs may be experiencing moral distress.The situations receiving the highest scores are comparable with the areas that are problematic for other critical care nurses as described in the literature. In this study, 4 RN characteristics were significantly related to moral distress: the desire to leave their current position, lack of spirituality, altered approach to patient care, and considering but not leaving a previous job because of moral distress.The results of this study add to the understanding of the moral distress in NICU RNs. The data will provide evidence for eventual psychometric testing and factor analysis of the Moral Distress Scale Neonatal-Pediatric Version.",

We examined the development, implementation, and qualitative assessment of the education component of a family-integrated care program.

The educational sessions were provided by staff and veteran parents to assist parents' development of confidence in providing caregiving skills and assuming the role of a primary caregiver for their infants as they moved closer to discharge. Effectiveness of the program was evaluated through anecdotal feedback and a formal evaluation process at discharge. The results indicated that the mothers were provided with the tools to parent their infants in the NICU, recognize their own strengths, increase their problem-solving strategies, and emotionally prepare them to take their infant home. Feedback from the participants provided direction to adapt the program to provide optimal parent support and education. Parental education is a valued and vital component of family-integrated care in the NICU.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that the immune response is blunted and underdeveloped in the premature infant, but human milk supports the infant's growth, function, and effectiveness. Thus, own mother's colostrum (OMC) administered oropharyngeally has potential to deliver oral immune therapy (C-OIT) even before enteral feedings have begun. Colostrum interacts with lymphoid tissue in the oropharynx and gut. Colostrum as oral immune therapy is delivered by swabbing the cheeks in the first days of life. Little formal study has evaluated its effectiveness. However, small studies demonstrate that it is a practice that is safe, feasible, and well tolerated even by the smallest premature infants. Encouraging preliminary evidence supports the effect of C-OIT to reduce the time to full enteral feedings. Effects on other outcomes is unclear, in part because existing studies are underpowered to detect significant differences on outcomes like necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, and death. Another limitation in the evidence base is that adherence to the intervention and the number of doses of colostrum infants received in the studies is not consistently made clear. More well-designed studies are needed to demonstrate the impact on neonatal complications and how C-OIT supports the infant's immune development. Quality improvement and time series reports of differences pre- and postimplementation of OMC given orally should minimally include statistics for adherence to the intervention and/or the number of doses an infant received as a covariate. Even so, OMC is an immune therapy that poses little risk yet offers likely cost-effective benefit for vulnerable infants.",

    "abstract": "The opioid epidemic in the United States has resulted in an increased number of drug-exposed infants who are at risk for developing neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Historically, these infants have been treated with the introduction and slow weaning of pharmaceuticals. Recently, a new model called Eat, Sleep, Console (ESC) has been developed that focuses on the comfort and care of these infants by maximizing nonpharmacologic methods, increasing family involvement in the treatment of their infant, and prn or \"as needed\" use of morphine.The purpose of this evidenced-based practice brief was to summarize and critically review emerging research on the ESC method of managing NAS and develop a recommendation for implementing an ESC model.A literature review was conducted using PubMed, Cochrane, and Google Scholar with a focus on ESC programs developed for treating infants with NAS.Several studies were found with successful development and implementation of the ESC model. Studies supported the use of ESC to decrease length of stay, exposure to pharmacologic agents, and overall cost of treatment.Video Abstract Available at https://journals.lww.com/advancesinneonatalcare/Pages/videogallery.aspx?videoId=32&autoPlay=true.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE The National Association of Neonatal Nurses (NANN) has been a forerunner in its commitment to recognizing the importance of consistent care of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) in neonates as essential for maintenance of their lifelines. NANN has published the only guideline that focuses on PICC practices specific to neonates and infants since its first guideline in 2001. The Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters: Guideline for Practice, 4th edition, follows in this tradition as an updated clinical resource directed to nurses, nurse practitioners, physicians, physician associates, and others who may care for infants with vascular access requirements. This fourth edition highlights the most recent literature informing evidence-based best practices to support care of neonates and infants who may require a PICC at birth or in the future. Beginning early vascular access assessment and planning at birth promotes vessel preservation across the lifespan. NEW TO THIS FOURTH EDITION Evidence-based graded practice recommendations Expanded discussion on Catheter-Associated Bloodstream Infection incorporating the most recent Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (Centers for Disease Control) recommendations Latest evidence for ultrasound Emerging technologies for securement and procedures Key components of this guideline include updated recommendations, neonatal PICC insertion procedures, discussion of insertion-related complications and interventional strategies, monitoring for post-insertion complications, care, maintenance, and current perspectives on emerging new technologies such as ultrasound and catheter securement. This fourth edition includes updates throughout the document supported by 280 references, with over 70% new since the third edition, with 11 images.1 The fourth edition of the guideline presents a concerted approach to harm prevention focusing on monitoring for early complications detection and management with increased emphasis on collaborative interprofessional PICC teams. The summary of recommendations leads with the definitive critically important key recommendation for appropriate catheter tip location in the superior vena cava through upper body insertion sites and the inferior vena cava through lower body insertion sites to minimize risks of complications.2-10 Additional recommendations address repositioning, antiseptics, dressings, education, and technology. CONCLUSION The NANN PICC Guideline has served as a respected resource for vascular access protocol development in neonatal intensive care units around the world. This most recent edition continues as the foundational resource for protocols, policies, and procedures development for nurses and other clinicians inserting PICCs and managing neonates and infants with PICCs around the world. The NANN recommends that this guideline be considered an essential resource in the development of education and training for any clinician performing PICC insertion, care, monitoring, and management. A consistent interprofessional approach is critical to influence future positive outcomes for our tiny patients. The guideline is available at https://nann.mycrowdwisdom.com/cw/course-details?entryId=10902832. - Summary of Key Practice Recommendations 1. Maintain the catheter tip in a central tip location in the superior vena cava/inferior vena cava.2-10 Rationale: Placement of the catheter tip in the superior vena cava or inferior vena cava is associated with a significantly lower risk of complications. 2. Obtain follow-up imaging subsequent to catheter repositioning and consider point-of-care ultrasound prior to any further repositioning.4,6,7,11-16 Rationale: Catheter tip position should be verified following all repositioning efforts. Accurate information about the catheter tip location supports minimizing complications. 3. Consider noninvasive catheter repositioning strategies to correct catheter tip malposition.6,17-20 Rationale: Noninvasive repositioning facilitates central catheter tip location while posing less trauma to the skin and patient associated with catheter withdrawal or replacement and dressing removal. 4. Maintain the extremity where a catheter is inserted in a consistent position for accurate radiographic confirmation.6,12,21-24 Rationale: Consistent patient positioning of the extremity of catheter insertion supports accurate and consistent confirmation of the catheter tip location. Changes in patient position impact catheter tip location and depth. 5. Perform dressing change as needed per patient or external indications.6,25-29 Rationale: The needs, risks, and benefits of dressing changes should be considered because the procedure is not without risk and may cause discomfort or trauma to fragile skin. 6. Consider chlorhexidine gluconate or povidone iodine as disinfectant agents for skin antisepsis. Remove povidone iodine prior to dressing application.1,28,47 Rationale: Removing povidone iodine minimizes the risk for tissue damage, absorption, and thyroid suppression. 7. Consider incorporating new technology and equipment to enhance visualization and vascular access practice as appropriate to specific patient needs.6,13,30-33 Rationale: Evolving technology enables new procedures that may help meet specific patient needs and improve outcomes. 8. Implement preventive strategies for complications including central line-associated bloodstream infection, as well as mechanical and other complications.6,34-36 Rationale: A culture of complications prevention has been successful in central line-associated bloodstream infection prevention. 9. Provide initial, ongoing, and consistent education for providers who insert and care for PICCs.6,29,35-39 Rationale: Appropriate and timely education for those placing and caring for PICCs has been integral to preventing central line-associated bloodstream infection and is critical in harm prevention of other complications. 10. Consider the right saphenous vein in the initial assessment for catheter placement unless gastroschisis is present.6,40-46 Rationale: Lower-extremity vessels are associated with lower complication rates. The right saphenous vein is associated with lower malposition rates.",

    "abstract": "Own mother's colostrum is rich in cytokines and other immune agents that may stimulate oropharyngeal-associated lymphoid tissue if administered oropharyngeally to extremely low-birth-weight (ELBW) infants during the first days of life when enteral feeding is contraindicated. However, the safety and feasibility of the oropharyngeal route for the administration of colostrum have not been determined. PURPOSE: To determine the safety of oropharyngeal administration of own mother's colostrum to ELBW infants in first days of life. A secondary purpose was to investigate the feasibility of (1) delivering this intervention to ELBW infants in the first days of life and (2) measuring concentrations of secretory immunoglobulin A and lactoferrin in tracheal aspirate secretions and urine of these infants. SUBJECTS: Five ELBW infants (mean birth weight and gestational age = 657 g and 25.5 weeks, respectively). DESIGN: Quasi-experimental, 1 group, pretest-posttest design. METHODS: Subjects received 0.2 mL of own mother's colostrum administered oropharyngeally every 2 hours for 48 consecutive hours, beginning at 48 hours of life. Concentrations of secretory immunoglobulin A and lactoferrin were measured in tracheal aspirates and urine of each subject at baseline, at the completion of the intervention and again 2 weeks later. RESULTS: All infants completed the entire treatment protocol, each receiving 24 treatments. A total of 15 urine specimens were collected and 14 were sufficient in volume for analysis. A total of 15 tracheal aspirates were collected, but only 7 specimens (47%) were sufficient in volume for analysis. There was wide variation in concentrations of secretory immunoglobulin A and lactoferrin in urine and tracheal aspirates among the 5 infants; however, several results were outside the limits of assay detection. All infants began to suck on the endotracheal tube during the administration of colostrum drops. Oxygen saturation measures remained stable or increased slightly during each of the treatment sessions. There were no episodes of apnea, bradycardia, hypotension, or other adverse effects associated with the administration of colostrum. CONCLUSIONS: Oropharyngeal administration of own mother's colostrum is easy, inexpensive, and well-tolerated by even the smallest and sickest ELBW infants. Future research should continue to examine the optimal procedure for measuring the direct immune effects of this therapy, as well as the clinical outcomes such as infections, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia.",

    "abstract": "The survival of very low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants has been shown to be effected by alterations in thermoregulation. Morbidity and mortality in these VLBW infants has remained higher than those in any other group of infants because of their innate vulnerability and because of exposure to risk factors in the environment. This leaves the premature infant vulnerable to cold stress especially in the first hours to weeks of life. At birth, the VLBW infant emerges from a warm, fluid environment and is thrust into a cold, abrasive environment before the protective layers of the epidermis have developed. Within minutes of birth, the core temperature begins to fall, particularly in infants whose birth weights are less than 1500 g. Hypothermia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in infants; therefore, maintaining normal body temperatures in the delivery room is crucial. We reviewed evidence related to thermoregulation at birth in VLBW infants, including transepidermal water loss and temperature control in the delivery room, during stabilization and upon admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. Delivery room management that focuses on the adaptation of the infant as well as early interventions that improve long-term outcomes may emphasize the \"golden hour\" of care and improve outcomes in this extremely vulnerable population.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE To examine the baseline acoustic environment in several mid-Atlantic region neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and investigate the perceived factors contributing to noise levels in these NICUs. SUBJECTS Quantitative data were collected from 3 urban, mid-Atlantic level IIIB and level IIIC NICUs. Qualitative data were collected via interview from 2 RNs employed in each of the study NICUs. DESIGN This was an exploratory descriptive study utilizing a mixed-methods approach. A quantitative method was used for sound-level data collection, and a qualitative method was utilized during interviews with nurses to examine perceptions of factors contributing to noise. METHODS Ambient sound levels, measured in decibels, were taken at 5-minute intervals over a 2-hour period during both day and night shifts in a central location at each NICU. In addition, nurses were interviewed using a standardized interview questionnaire, and these interviews were then reviewed to determine themes regarding perceived factors contributing to sound levels. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Hourly mean sound levels in each NICU ranged from 53.9 dB to 60.6 dB, with no statistically significant difference between noise levels recorded on day shift versus night shift, and no statistically significant difference among sites. Qualitative data showed that nurses' believed day shift to be louder than night shift and many perceived their own NICU as \"pretty quiet.\" Key contributing factors to increased sound levels were stated as monitors or alarms, performing invasive procedures, presence of family, nurses or doctors giving report or rounds, and ringing phones. PRINCIPAL RESULTS Noise levels were found to be above the American Academy of Pediatrics–recommended 45-dB level and often louder than the 50-dB level, which should not be exceeded more than 10% of the time. The recommended impulse maximum of 65 dB was also exceeded. Environmental Protection Agency recommendations for hospitals include sound levels no louder than 35 dB on night shift; this standard was also violated. CONCLUSIONS Elevated sound levels need to be addressed in individual NICUs around the country. Further exploratory studies, as well as research regarding effective methods of decreasing sound levels in the NICU environment, are necessary. NICUs can implement behavioral and structural changes that can decrease the sound levels in the NICU environment and decrease the potential for exposure of patients to the harmful physiological effects of increased sound levels.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare the presence of perceived paternal stress and depressive symptomatology in fathers of preterm infants over time. SUBJECTS: Fathers of NICU infants born before 30 weeks of gestation. DESIGN: Prospective convenience sample. METHODS: Consenting fathers were given 2 self-report questionnaires: Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) and Parent Stressor Scale: Infant Hospitalization (PSS:IH) on 7th (time 1), 21st (time 2), and 35th (time 3) days of life. Objective measurement of illness severity was quantified by Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology. Statistical methods included generalized linear estimating equation and mixed linear modeling. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Stress and depressive symptomatology in fathers of preterm infants. RESULTS: Stress scores (PSS:IH) were unchanged over time (P = .62) indicating that fathers (n = 35) remain significantly stressed. Individual subcomponents of stress (parent role alteration, infant appearance/behavior, NICU sights/sounds) also remained constant over the study period (P = .05 for each). Stress scores over time were not modified by demographic characteristics (marriage, education, insurance). Mean depressive symptomatology scores (CES-D) decreased over time (P = .04). The percentage of fathers with elevated CES-D scores (>16) decreased from a baseline 60% but did not diminish between times 2 (39%) and 3 (36%). Parent Stressor Scale: Infant Hospitalization stress scores were correlated with CES-D depressive symptomatology scores (P < .01). Socioeconomic factors influenced initial CES-D scores, but only marriage ameliorated subsequent changes in measurements. Objective measurement of infant illness (Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology) did not influence paternal CES-D or PSS:IH scores. CONCLUSION: Fathers of premature infants in a medical NICU demonstrated elevated levels of stress that persisted across time for all domains of measured stress. Paternal self-reported stress and depressive symptomatology was independent of infant illness. One third of fathers had persistently elevated CES-D scores. If these findings are representative of general NICU population, then the emotional needs of our fathers are not being fully addressed.",

SUBJECTS: Neonates who had PICCs inserted while hospitalized in an urban, 84-bed, level III neonatal intensive care unit in the southwestern United States between 2004 and 2009 were included in the study. A total of 559 neonates with 626 PICCs were reviewed. Neonates who were transferred out of the hospital with an indwelling PICC or had incomplete PICC data were excluded (n = 29). DESIGN: Comparative descriptive. METHOD: Retrospective review of PICC records. Demographic data, neonate survival to PICC removal, PICCs inserted by non-PICC team members, and complications were compiled. Complications included presumed sepsis, occlusion, leaking, infiltration/edema, inadvertent removal, phlebitis, pleural effusion, tip malposition, and catheter breakage. The complications were analyzed between extremities using chi-square or independent-samples t test where appropriate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Type and rate of complication requiring PICC removal and the extremity used for insertion. PRINCIPAL RESULTS: A total of 374 PICCs (59.7%) were inserted in upper extremities and 252 (40.3%) in lower extremities. The upper and lower extremity groups were comparable in all variables except neonate survival to PICC removal, which was greater in neonates with lower extremity PICCs (95.2% in upper extremities vs 98.8% in lower extremities; P = .01). No significant difference (P = .08) was found in the overall complication rate (27% in upper extremity PICCs vs 21% in lower extremity PICCs). Presumed sepsis was the most common complication requiring PICC removal in both extremity groups. At the time of removal, upper extremity PICCs were more likely to have a noncentral tip than lower extremity PICCs (15% vs 4%, respectively). In PICCs removed because of complications, noncentral tips were found to be statistically significant in upper extremity PICCs (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: No significant difference was found in complications that necessitated PICC removal between upper versus lower extremity PICC insertion sites. Catheter tip location may have a significant impact on complications and deserves further investigation. The choice of a PICC insertion site in neonates should be based on the quality of appropriate, available veins and the preference and skill of the inserter. Every effort should be made to achieve and maintain a centrally located PICC tip.",

These strategies are generally nurse-driven and we believe their importance has been underutilized. In this article we will emphasize the importance of maternal presence as a mediator for pain relief. The efficacy of breastfeeding, maternal skin-to-skin care (often referred to as kangaroo care), and multisensorial stimulation such as auditory and olfactory recognition will be the primary focus of our discussion. In addition, although primarily mother-driven, these strategies are ultimately nurse-enabled, thus the importance of this connection cannot be under appreciated with respect to successful implementation in the NICU.",

However, a general view of the experiences preterm infants' mothers can face during their infants' hospitalization and after discharge is lacking.The aim of this integrative review was to explore practical and emotional experiences of preterm infants' mothers with respect to breast milk expression and breastfeeding, from the birth of the preterm infant, during the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) stay, and postdischarge until the cessation of breastfeeding.A systematic literature search from MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and Cochrane databases were performed. The search resulted in 20 qualitative and 3 quantitative studies. The data were analyzed by thematic analysis.Coping was the central theme in mothers' experiences. The benefits of breast milk served both as a supportive factor and an obstructive factor for the mothers, and breastfeeding was used to rebuild connection and motherhood. Simultaneously, the mothers needed to cope with new demands, interfering NICU environment, demanding expressing, and difficulties with breastfeeding.Expressing and breastfeeding are important for the mothers to contribute to their infants' care and to rebuild the interrupted connection. Evidence-based and sensitive informational and practical counseling are vital for the mothers. Intensive emotional support is important during encountered problems and during cessation.Future research is needed about mothers' experiences using supplementation methods, test-weighing, exploring experiences of mothers of late-preterm infants, and the validity of the concept of coping with this phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess and describe the practices involved in the insertion and maintenance of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) in neonates in level III neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in the United States and to compare the findings with current recommendations and evidence.The study included responses from 187 nurses, nurse practitioners, and neonatologists who place PICCs in NICUs representing 43 states.A 90-question, multiple-choice survey of a variety of PICC practices was sent to NICU directors and nursing staff responsible for PICC insertion. The explorative survey was sent by electronic and standard mail services. A descriptive analysis of the responses was performed.Main outcome measures included the response rate to the survey and the summarized responses of multiple categories of PICC practices.Of the 460 level III NICUs contacted, 187 returned surveys meeting criteria for analysis, yielding a 42% response rate. Responses showed wide variation of PICC practices in multiple aspects of PICC insertion and maintenance. The greatest level of conformity was seen with the following practices: use of 2 nurses to perform a dressing change, trimming the PICC, using a kit or cart containing insertion supplies, use of maximal sterile barrier precautions during insertion, catheter tip residing in the superior vena cava for upper body insertions, and not heparin locking, infusing blood products, performing catheter repair, or inserting using Modified Seldinger Technique. Some identified practices, such as infusion tubing change and catheter entry techniques, were contrary to current evidence and demonstrated a lack of correct information, and some represented safety concerns for the neonates having PICCs.This extensive national survey of NICU PICC practices showed wide variation in multiple aspects of PICC insertion and maintenance. A gap between the evidence and current practice was evident in many facets of training, insertion techniques, and maintenance processes. The data suggest a need for an increase in awareness of clinicians of current practice guidelines and standards and the need for further research to develop an evidence basis for many aspects of PICC care where lacking.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The provision of breastfeeding support in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) may assist a mother to develop a milk supply for the NICU infant. Human milk offers unique benefits and its provision unique challenges in this highly vulnerable population. The provision of breastfeeding support in this setting has not been studied in a large, multihospital study. We describe the frequency of breastfeeding support provided by nurses and examined relationships between NICU nursing characteristics, the availability of a lactation consultant (LC), and breastfeeding support. SUBJECTS AND DESIGN: This was a secondary analysis of 2008 survey data from 6060 registered nurses in 104 NICUs nationally. Nurse managers provided data on LCs. These NICUs were members of the Vermont Oxford Network, a voluntary quality and safety collaborative. METHODS: Nurses reported on the infants (n = 15,233) they cared for on their last shift, including whether breastfeeding support was provided to parents. Breastfeeding support was measured as a percentage of infants on the unit. The denominator was all infants assigned to all nurse respondents on that NICU. The numerator was the number of infants that nurses reported providing breastfeeding support. Nurses also completed the Practice Environment Scale of the Nursing Work Index (PES-NWI), a nationally endorsed nursing care performance measure. The NICU nursing characteristics include the percentages of nurses with a BSN or higher degree and with 5 or more years of NICU experience, an acuity-adjusted staffing ratio, and PES-NWI subscale scores. Lactation consultant availability was measured as any/none and in full-time equivalent positions per 10 beds. RESULTS: The parents of 14% of infants received breastfeeding support from the nurse. Half of the NICUs had an LC. Multiple regression analysis showed a significant relationship between 2 measures of nurse staffing and breastfeeding support. A 1 SD higher acuity-adjusted staffing ratio was associated with a 2% increase in infants provided breastfeeding support. A 1 SD higher score on the Staffing and Resource Adequacy PES-NWI subscale was associated with a 2% increase in infants provided breastfeeding support. There was no association between other NICU nursing characteristics or LCs and nurse-provided breastfeeding support. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses provide breastfeeding support around the clock. On a typical shift, about 1 in 7 NICU infants receives breastfeeding support from a nurse. Lactation consultants are not routinely available in NICUs, and their presence does not influence whether nurses provide breastfeeding support. Better nurse staffing fosters nurse provision of breastfeeding support.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decades, advances in neonatal care have led to substantial increases in survival among preterm infants. With these gains, recent concerns have focused on increases in neurodevelopment morbidity related to the interplay between stressful early life experiences and the immature neuroimmune systems. This interplay between these complex mechanisms is often described as the brain-gut signaling system. The role of the gut microbiome and the brain-gut signaling system have been found to be remarkably related to both short- and long-term stress and health. Recent evidence supports that microbial species, ligands, and/or products within the developing intestine play a key role in early programming of the central nervous system and regulation of the intestinal innate immunity.The purpose of this state-of-the-science review is to explore the supporting evidence demonstrating the importance of the brain-gut-microbiota axis in regulation of early life experience. We also discuss the role of gut microbiome in modulating stress and pain responses in high-risk infants. A conceptual framework has been developed to illustrate the regulation mechanisms involved in early life experience.The science in this area is just beginning to be uncovered; having a fundamental understanding of these relationships will be important as new discoveries continue to change our thinking, leading potentially to changes in practice and targeted interventions.",

The type of infant pain instrument chosen is a significant factor in guiding pain management practice. The purpose of this review was to summarize current infant pain measures by introducing a conceptual framework for pain measurement. Although more than 40 infant pain instruments exist, many were devised solely for research purposes; several of the newly developed instruments largely overlap with existing instruments. Integration of pain management into daily practice remains problematic. Understanding how each instrument measures infant pain allows clinicians to make better decisions about what instrument to use with which infant and in what circumstances. In addition, novel new measurement techniques need further testing.",

Factors associated with postpartum depressive symptoms included PTS, anxiety, maternal age, and whether the mother lived with the baby's father (F₄, ₁₀₄ = 52.27, P < .001). The severity of the infants' illness, parental stress, and maternal education were not associated with depressive symptoms among low-income mothers of NICU infants.On the basis of our findings, we recommend that low-income women should be screened for symptoms of anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and postpartum depression on their infants' admission to the NICU. When this is not feasible, we advise NICU healthcare providers to assess women for familial support, maternal age, posttraumatic stress related to their infants birth, and anxiety to determine which mothers are at the greatest risk for postpartum depressive symptoms. Screening for postpartum depression in the NICU can aid in early identification and treatment, thereby decreasing negative consequences for mothers and their infants.",

    "abstract": "Background Premature infants are at risk for difficulties in feeding, social interaction, and growth. Many premature infants exhibit a lower capacity for self-regulation, resulting in less behavioral alertness and hypersensitivity to stimulation. Feeding is critically important because it is a primary factor for infant growth and a major concern for both parents and clinicians. Purpose The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate sucking organization in premature infants following a preterm infant multisensory intervention, the Auditory, Tactile, Visual, and Vestibular (ATVV) intervention. Methods: A convenience sample of 183 healthy premature infants born 29-34 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) enrolled. Sucking organization was measured at baseline, then weekly, during the infant's hospital stay. Results: A quadratic trend was observed for number of sucks, sucks per burst, and maturity index with the intervention group increasing significantly faster by day 7 (model estimates for group × day: β= 13.69, P < .01; β = 1.16, P < .01; and β= 0.12, P < .05, respectively). Sucking pressure increased linearly over time, with significant between-group differences at day 14 (β= 45.66, P < .01). Implications for Practice: The ATVV infants exhibited improved sucking organization during hospitalization, suggesting that the ATVV intervention improves maturation of oral feeding. Implications for Research: Further research that includes 2 or more tests, delivered the same day and/or over consecutive days, will provide researchers and clinicians a more sensitive indicator of maturational changes in feeding behaviors.",

    "abstract": "The standard procedure to assess an infant in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) who is suspected of aspirating on oral feedings is a videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS). The VFSS has been used for more than 30 years to assess dysphagia and is considered the gold standard. However, there are challenges to the VFSS, including radiation exposure, transport to radiology, usage of barium, limited positioning options, and cost. An alternative approach is fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), which uses a flexible endoscope passed transnasally into the pharynx to assess anatomy, movement/sensation of structures, swallow function, and response to therapeutic interventions. Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing has been established as a valid tool for evaluating dysphagia and utilized as an alternative or supplement to the VFSS in both adults and children.This article provides an overview of the current challenges in the NICU with assessing aspiration and introduces a multidisciplinary FEES program for bottle and breastfeeding.A review of the literature of dysphagia, VFSS, and FEES in the adult, pediatric, infant, and neonatal populations was performed. Clinical competency standards were researched and then implemented through an internal process of validation. Finally, a best practice protocol was designed as it relates to FEES in the NICU.Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing is a safe alternative to the VFSS. It can be utilized at the infant's bedside in a NICU for the diagnosis and treatment of swallowing disorders by allowing the clinician the ability to replicate a more accurate feeding experience, therefore, determining a safe feeding plan.Competency and training are essential to establishing a multidisciplinary FEES program in the NICU.Further research is needed to compare the efficacy and validity of FEES versus VFSS for infants in the NICU. Furthermore, evaluating the efficacy of FEES during breastfeeding is warranted.",

    "abstract": "A term borrowed from emergency and cardiovascular medicine, the phrase \"Golden Hour\" refers to the first hour of an infant's life following delivery. The impact of implementation of a Golden Hour Protocol in a level III neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for infants delivered at less than 28 weeks gestation was examined, with a focus on admission temperature, admission glucose, and time to the initiation of an intravenous glucose and amino acid administration. As part of a quality initiative project, data were collected before and after the implementation of the Golden Hour Protocol for infants born at less than 28 weeks gestational age from May 2008 through December 2011. Desired outcomes were admission axillary temperature within a range of 36.5°C to 37.4°C, admission glucose more than 50 mg/dL, and the initiation of a glucose and amino acid infusion within 1 hour of birth. Key components of the Golden Hour included the use of a protocolized script, which clearly defined the roles of the delivery room personnel, placing the infant in a polyethylene bag to prevent heat loss, the application of the isolette skin temperature probe within 10 minutes of age, and insertion of umbilical catheters before moving the infant from the resuscitation area to the NICU. Data were collected on 225 infants born less than 28 weeks gestation: 106 in the preprotocol group and 119 in the postprotocol group. Differences between the 2 groups were not statistically significant for birth weight and gestational age. There was a statistically significant difference in the number of infants with an admission temperature in-range (36.5°C-37.4°C) between the preprotocol and postprotocol infants (28.3% vs 49.6%; P = .002). There was a statistically significant difference in the incidence of admission glucose greater than 50 mg/dL between the pre- and postprotocol groups (55.7% vs 72%; P = .012). There was a highly statistically significant difference in the number of post-Golden Hour Protocol infants who received an intravenous administration of glucose and amino acids within 1 hour of life compared with the preprotocol group (61.3% vs 7%; P = 0.001). Our results suggest that the implementation of the Golden Hour Protocol can significantly improve the stabilization of infants delivered less than 28 weeks gestation.",

In family-centered healthcare settings, exploring fathers' experiences and needs is important because men's roles in society, especially as fathers, are changing. Purpose: To describe fathers' needs when their infants are admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit and to discuss these needs within a theoretical framework of masculinity to advance understanding and generate meaningful knowledge for clinical practices. Methods: This qualitative study used participant observation, interviews, multiple sequential interviews, and a focus group discussion. Data were analyzed using grounded theory principles. Results: Analysis of the fathers' needs generated 2 primary themes: (1) Fathers as caregivers and breadwinners and (2) fathers and emotions. Fathers wished to be involved and to take care of their infants but have to balance cultural and social norms and expectations of being breadwinners with their wishes to be equal coparents. Implications for Practice/Research: Health professionals in neonatal intensive care units must be aware of fathers' need and desire to be equal coparents. Nurses should play a key role by, for example, showing that fathers are as important to their infants as are the mothers, helping them become involved in childcare, and ensuring that they are directly informed about their children's progress. Further research in other cultural settings would contribute to knowledge regarding fatherhood and the role of fathers in childcare.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Healthcare professionals in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) tend to focus attention on the mothers and the newborn infants. Thus, fathers may find it difficult to establish an optimal father-child relationship and their stress may increase and persist during hospitalization. PURPOSE: To investigate the impact of a more father-friendly NICU on paternal stress and their participation in childcare. METHODS: A quasiexperimental design was conducted on Danish-speaking fathers of newborn infants 28 or more weeks' gestational age. The Parental Stressor Scale: Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (PSS:NICU) was used to measure paternal perceptions of stressors. Paternal participation in childcare was measured using 7 additional items. The questionnaires were distributed on admission to the NICU, at the 14th day of hospitalization, and at the time of discharge. The primary outcome was the difference in the PSS:NICU overall stress score on admission to the NICU and at the time of discharge in the control group compared with the intervention group. RESULTS: A total of 109 fathers were included. The overall PSS:NICU stress score increased after the intervention. Paternal involvement, staff expectations, and the social expectation to fulfill the traditional role of a breadwinner and additionally of a caregiver may have caused increased stress. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Healthcare professionals must be aware of the father's need to be an equal coparent. Nurses, as key persons, should motivate and expect fathers to be involved, and support them to establish a father-child relationship, although they might become more stressed. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: More adequate outcome measures are needed to determine the effect of interventions on paternal stress.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

Identification of infants in need of specialized treatment is critical to ensure appropriate nutrition and feeding skill development. Valid and reliable assessment tools help clinicians objectively evaluate feeding. Purpose: To identify and evaluate assessment tools available for clinical assessment of bottle- and breastfeeding in infants younger than 6 months. Methods/Search Strategy: CINAHL, HaPI, PubMed, and Web of Science were searched for \"infant feeding\" and \"assessment tool.\" The literature (n = 237) was reviewed for relevant assessment tools. A secondary search was conducted in CINAHL and PubMed for additional literature on identified tools. Findings/Results: Eighteen assessment tools met inclusion criteria. Of these, 7 were excluded because of limited available literature or because they were intended for use with a specific diagnosis or in research only. There are 11 assessment tools available for clinical practice. Only 2 of these were intended for bottle-feeding. All 11 indicated that they were appropriate for use with breastfeeding. None of the available tools have adequate psychometric development and testing. Implications for Practice: All of the tools should be used with caution. The Early Feeding Skills Assessment and Bristol Breastfeeding Assessment Tool had the most supportive psychometric development and testing. Implications for Research: Feeding assessment tools need to be developed and tested to guide optimal clinical care of infants from birth through 6 months. A tool that assesses both bottle- and breastfeeding would allow for consistent assessment across feeding methods.",

    "abstract": "Inserting, maintaining, and monitoring vascular access are integral components of neonatal care. Advances in vascular access technology have led to the insertion of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) to provide stable venous access for early and aggressive parenteral nutrition. Medications that are irritating or damaging, or those with a high osmolality or a nonphysiologic pH, can also be safely administered into the central venous system. The need for repeated peripheral intravenous attempts, as well as the associated pain and physiologic instability, are virtually eliminated once a PICC line is placed. Complications related to PICCs may occur at any phase of therapy: during insertion, while indwelling, or after discontinuing the line. The risk factors associated with PICCs are distinctly different from peripheral intravenous lines because of their long dwell time, central placement, and potential to migrate. Part 1 of Focus on the Physical offers a review of the relevant anatomy of the vascular system and a discussion of the appropriate sites for catheter tip placement. Guidelines for a systematic physical assessment, along with recommendations for standardized PICC documentation, are provided. A review of the signs and symptoms of more frequently occurring complications, such as catheter occlusion and bloodstream infections, is presented to enhance awareness of PICC-specific complications in the neonate and to expedite early detection and treatment. Part 2 of this series will focus on systematic assessment for less common complications such as catheter migration, dislodgement, breakage, and thrombosis, as well as the life-threatening complications of pleural and pericardial effusion.",

Good evidence exists to support the use of CRP measurements in conjunction with other established diagnostic tests (such as a white blood cell (WBC) count with differential and blood culture) to establish or exclude the diagnosis of sepsis in full-term or near-term infants. This article reviews the immunologic function of CRP and the history of CRP testing. The 3 methods for measuring CRP and the sensitivity and specificity of this diagnostic test are analyzed. Guidelines for the use of CRP in the evaluation and management of infants with suspected sepsis are presented. Quantitative serial CRP levels, obtained 24 hours after the onset of signs and symptoms of infection, with serial measurements 12 to 24 hours apart, offer the most sensitive and reliable information. At least 2 CRP levels, obtained 24 hours apart, with levels ≤10 mg/L, are needed to identify infants unlikely to be infected. The use of CRP to exclude infection may allow clinicians to discontinue antibiotics at 48 hours in select infants, limiting extended unnecessary antibiotic exposure.",

    "abstract": "Phototherapy is the use of visible light for the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn. This relatively common therapy lowers the serum bilirubin level by transforming bilirubin into water-soluble isomers that can be eliminated without conjugation in the liver. The dose of phototherapy largely determines how quickly it works; the dose, in turn, is determined by the wavelength of the light, the intensity of the light (irradiance), the distance between the light and the infant, and the body surface area exposed to the light. Commercially available phototherapy systems include those that deliver light via fluorescent bulbs, halogen quartz lamps, light-emitting diodes, and fiberoptic mattresses. Proper nursing care enhances the effectiveness of phototherapy and minimizes complications. Caregiver responsibilities include ensuring effective irradiance delivery, maximizing skin exposure, providing eye protection and eye care, carefully monitoring thermoregulation, maintaining adequate hydration, promoting elimination, and supporting parent-infant interaction.",

    "abstract": "Theoretically, single patient room newborn intensive care units are designed to optimize the developmental outcomes of critically ill infants by providing individual patient environments with decreased stimulation and noise. This article reports the perceptions of 127 neonatal intensive care nurses after the move into a single room neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The observations of the nurses were obtained using a questionnaire to identify some of the benefits, risks, and specific patient safety concerns related to the single room NICU design. The results suggest that in this setting the single patient room concept was deemed superior for patient care and parent satisfaction when compared to the large open unit. However, the nurses emphasize that the success of single room care model primarily depends on providing sufficient staff coverage, given the decreased patient visibility and greater distances between patients. Larger units also present unique communication, staff education, and quality improvement challenges. To further evaluate the impact of single room designs we evaluated data on important clinical issues, specifically noise levels and catheter-related infections provide objective measures of important improvements. Noise levels decreased from an average of 63 to 56 decibels and catheter-associated bloodstream infections fell from 10.1 per 1000 device days to 3.3 per 1000 device days in the 9 months after the move to single patient rooms. This article provides pragmatic design suggestions that should be prospectively considered to minimize staff isolation and stress.",

Fathers were interviewed 6 to 8 times over a 6-month period, beginning within 1 month of the birth of their infant and continuing after neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) discharge. Interview guides were used only to initiate conversation; probing, clarifying questions helped fathers provide detailed stories of what they did, thought, and felt about specific situations. Transcriptions of all 63 interviews were treated as meaningful text and analyzed using interpretive methods.Fathers' narratives revealed the primacy of work in their lives; work remained a pivotal focus even after an early birth. Fathers returned to work quickly after their infant's birth. They approached their work with a renewed sense of fervor in order to provide financially for their families. They found comfort in their work because in the work setting they felt that they were the experts, as opposed to feeling like novices in the NICU. The most stressful aspect of the experience was juggling their time between work and the outside world.Fathers may respond to the experience of having a premature infant very differently from mothers. Because fathers' stressors often lie outside the NICU, their stressors may be invisible to healthcare providers. A deeper understanding of fathering must consider the social, familial, and historical processes that shape fathering practices.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE To determine if a recording of a mother's voice talking soothingly to her baby is useful in diminishing pain in newborns born between 32 and 36 weeks' gestational age (GA) during routine painful procedures. BACKGROUND While maternal skin-to-skin contact has been proven efficacious for diminishing procedural pain in both full-term and preterm neonates, it is often not possible for mothers to be present during a painful procedure. Because auditory development occurs before the third trimester of gestation, it was hypothesized that maternal voice could substitute for maternal presence and be effective in diminishing pain response. SUBJECTS Preterm infants between 32 and 36 weeks' GA (n = 20) in the first 10 days of life admitted to 2 urban university-affiliated neonatal intensive care units. DESIGN AND METHODS Crossover design with random ordering of condition. Following informed consent, an audio recording of the mother talking soothingly to her baby was filtered to simulate the mother's voice traveling through amniotic fluid. A final 10-minute recording of repetition of mothers' talking was recorded with maximum peaks of 70 decibels (dB) and played at levels ranging between 60 and 70 ambient decibels (dbA), selected above recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics in order to be heard over high ambient noise in the settings. This was played to her infant by a portable cassette tape player 3 times daily during a 48-hour period after feedings (gavage, bottle, or breast). At the end of 48 hours when blood work was required for clinical purposes, using a crossover design, the infant underwent the heel lancing with or without the recording being played. The order of condition was randomized, and the second condition was within 10 days. The Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) was used as primary outcome. This is a composite measure using heart rate, oxygen saturation, 3 facial actions, behavioral state, and gestational age. This measure has demonstrated reliability and validity indexes. RESULTS There were no significant differences between groups on the PIPP or any of the individual components of the PIPP except a lower oxygen saturation level in the voice condition following the procedure. The second condition, regardless of whether it was voice or control, had higher heart rate scores and lower oxygen saturation scores even in the prelance baseline and warming phases. Order did not affect PIPP scores or facial actions. CONCLUSIONS Different modalities of maternal presence would appear to be necessary to blunt pain response in infants, and recorded maternal voice alone is not sufficient. The loudness of the recording may have obliterated the infant's ability to discern the mother's voice and may even have been aversive, reflected in decreased oxygen saturation levels in the voice condition. Preterm neonates of 32 to 36 weeks' gestation may become sensitized to painful experiences and show anticipatory physiological response.",

PARTICIPANTS Eighty-two registered nurses working in a level III neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) were included. METHODS AND DESIGN This was a quantitative pretest, intervention, post-test design with a single group undergoing educational sessions in the 6 areas of pain management, symptom management, ethical/legal issues, communication/culture, spiritual/anxiety, and prevention of compassion fatigue. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS An instrument, \"Comfort in Caring for Dying Infants\" (CLCDI), was developed to assess pre- and posteducational knowledge and comfort in these areas. RESULTS There were statistically significant higher levels of comfort and knowledge in care for dying infants in the areas of ethical/legal issues and symptom management after the educational programs. Although not statistically significant, mean scores were higher after the educational sessions on pain management, spirituality/anxiety, and prevention of compassion fatigue. The communication/culture module scores were lower in the post-test administration. CONCLUSIONS Education by hospice experts in the NICU can assist nurses' comfort with care of the dying infant. In addition, ongoing support is highly desirable for all staff participating in such care. The authors suggest incident debriefings from outside experts, debriefing after each infant's death, multidisciplinary meetings for the whole team, and having sessions of lessons learned on infant death cases.",

DESIGN A retrospective descriptive study. SUBJECTS All infants born between 32 to 34 weeks' gestational age (GA) (n = 4932) followed by ParadigmHealth, a care management company, from January 2001 through June 2004 were evaluated. Infants with major congenital anomalies were excluded. This sample represented 453 NICUs in 24 states in the United States. METHODS Retrospective data analysis. Infants born between 32 and 34 weeks' GA were studied (n = 4932). This subset of patients in the NICU was compared to the entire population in the database (n = 19,923) for incidence and cost comparison. Infants were followed for 2 weeks after hospital discharge. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Demographics, feeding characteristics, respiratory needs, complications, discharge needs, and patient costs. RESULTS The 4932 infants admitted to the NICU with gestational ages of 32 to 34 weeks represented 24.8% of the 19,923 admissions during this time period. This cohort experienced low mortality (0.5%) and had an average length of stay (LOS) of 17.6 days. The average cost per case was $31,000, representing 21.6% of total NICU costs. Fifty-four percent of infants experienced respiratory compromise, requiring ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure, or oxygen during their hospital course. Fifty-six percent required intravenous nutrition, and 19% of these patients were discharged home with ongoing medical needs and the use of durable medical equipment. CONCLUSIONS Although morbidities with long-term consequences were rare, there is a significant burden on the infant, family, and healthcare team for patients 32 to 34 weeks' GA. It is important to understand the characteristics of this group of infants and explore ways of optimizing care to minimize this burden.",

SUBJECTS: Twenty-eight term infants that were exposed to methadone in utero and exhibited symptoms of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) prior to hospital discharge were included into the study. The sample was further divided by self-selected infant feeding method including (1) predominately breastfed (n = 8), combination fed (n = 11) or predominately formula fed (n = 9). METHODS: Data were extracted by two independent researchers from both the mother's and infant's chart. This included variables such as NAS scores, NAS treatment, infant feeding method and baseline demographic information. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: NAS scores were assessed by Registered Nurses according to hospital protocol using a Modified Finnegan Scoring Tool. PRINCIPAL RESULTS: A non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis one way analysis of variance based on ranks revealed statistically significant differences in the number of NAS scores recorded (P = 0.001), magnitude (P < 0.0001) and area score (P = 0.04) by infant feeding method. In particular, infants who were predominantly breastfed had significantly fewer NAS scores done and lower mean scores suggesting decreased severity and duration of NAS symptoms when compared to infants who were combination fed or predominately formula fed. CONCLUSION: Breastfeeding may offer enhanced benefits for infants who have been exposed to methadone in utero. As such, in the absence of contraindications, mothers in methadone maintenance programs should be encouraged and supported to breastfeed their infants.",

SUBJECTS One hundred thirty-four preterm infants at high risk for NEC because of either having a birth weight of <1500 g or requiring mechanical ventilation at birth. DESIGN Descriptive secondary analysis using data from a larger longitudinal study. METHODS Weekly review of infants' medical record until discharge; demographic questionnaire completed by mothers at the time of enrollment; and data analysis done with logistic regression, Fischer's exact tests, and correlations. OUTCOME MEASURES Total number of days the infant required mechanical ventilation, birth weight in grams, number of infections prior to NEC diagnosis, maternal race (black, white, or Asian), and infant gender were used to predict the development of NEC. RESULTS Maximum likelihood estimates indicated that mechanical ventilation had a positive relationship with developing NEC, such that as the number of days of mechanical ventilation increased so did the risk of developing NEC. There was also a very strong positive relationship between the number of nosocomial infections and NEC, indicating that as the number of infections increased, the likelihood of developing NEC increased. Although the relationship between race and NEC was not significant in the logistic regression, the Fisher exact test showed that black preterm infants had increased incidence of NEC as compared with other races. This relationship was not due to correlations between race and mechanical ventilation or infections. No relationship between gender and NEC was noted. Birth weight was not significantly associated with NEC in the logistic regression but was correlated with NEC, probably because of its correlation with mechanical ventilation and number of infections. CONCLUSIONS In this sample, number of infections and length of mechanical ventilation were the primary predictors of NEC in preterm infants. In addition, the frequency that black infants are diagnosed with NEC is significantly higher than that of other races. Knowledge of risk factors for NEC can allow healthcare providers to evaluate and adjust care practices for preterm infants who present with higher risk for NEC on the basis of empirical data.",

    "abstract": "Use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is increasing as a means of respiratory support for respiratory distress syndrome in many premature neonates across the United States. Nasal CPAP is less invasive and may be as effective as mechanical ventilation in premature infants, and has been shown to cause less lung damage in premature neonates. Because of the increased use of nasal CPAP in neonates, especially younger and more fragile neonates, the presence of nare and nasal septum breakdown may be seen as a complication. Currently, all nasal CPAP systems use a hat and prong or mask type of delivery system. This appears to be effective for many neonates, but for some, it is difficult to appropriately fit the hat and prongs. The result of an inappropriately fitted device can be mild to severe nare and nasal septum damage. This article will discuss the need for nasal CPAP and the mechanics of nasal CPAP, but more importantly, serve to guide caregivers in the appropriate physical assessment and care of a neonate on nasal CPAP with the goal of preventing skin breakdown and nasal damage.",

    "abstract": "Hospital-acquired infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in neonatal intensive care units. Central line-associated blood stream infection (CLABSI) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are costly, preventable infections targeted for eradication by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. After evaluation of current practice and areas for improvement, neonatal-specific CLABSI and VAP bundles were developed and implemented on the basis of available best evidence. The overall goal was to reduce infection rates at or below benchmarks set by National Healthcare Safety Network. All neonates with central lines (umbilical or percutaneous) and/or patients who were endotracheally intubated were included. All patients were risk stratified on the basis of weight per National Healthcare Safety Network reporting requirements: less than 750 g, 751-1000 g, 1001-1500 g, 1501-2500 g, and greater than 2500 g. The research was conducted as a quality improvement study. Neonatal-specific educational modules were developed by neonatal nurse leaders for CLABSI and VAP. Bundle development entailed combining select interventions, mainly from the adult literature, that the nurse leaders believed would reduce infection rates. Nursing practice guidelines and supply carts were updated to ensure understanding, compliance, and convenience. A CLABSI checklist was initiated and used at the time of line insertion by the nurse to ensure standardized infection control practices. Compliance audits were performed by nurse leaders weekly on intubated patients to validate VAP bundle implementation. CLABSI and VAP bundle compliance was audited and infection rates were measured before and after both bundle implementations following strict National Healthcare Safety Network inclusion criteria for CLABSI and VAP determination. The reduction in CLABSI elicited 84 fewer hospital days, estimated cost savings of $348,000, a 92% reduction in CLABSI (preintervention to postintervention), and a reduction in central line days by 27%. The reduction in VAP resulted in 72 fewer hospital days, estimated cost savings of $300,000, 71% reduction in VAP (preintervention to postintervention), and a reduction in vent days by 31%. Nurses are central in hospital efforts to improve quality care. The bundled interventions provided the nurses with a structure to successfully implement a systematic process for improvement. Nursing leaders ensured that bundles were implemented strategically and provided consistent and specific feedback on intervention compliance with quarterly CLABSI and VAP rates. Real-time feedback assisted the registered nurses, neonatal nurse practitioners, and physicians appreciation of the effectiveness of the change in practice. Finally, empowering the bedside nurse to lead the bundle implementation increased personal ownership and compliance and ultimately improved practice and patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Phototherapy is the use of visible light for the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn. This relatively common therapy lowers the serum bilirubin level by transforming bilirubin into water-soluble isomers that can be eliminated without conjugation in the liver. The dose of phototherapy is a key factor in how quickly it works; dose in turn is determined by the wavelength of the light, the intensity of the light (irradiance), the distance between the light and the baby, and the body surface area exposed to the light. Commercially available phototherapy systems include those that deliver light via fluorescent bulbs, halogen quartz lamps, light-emitting diodes, and fiberoptic mattresses. Proper nursing care enhances the effectiveness of phototherapy and minimizes complications. Caregiver responsibilities include ensuring effective irradiance delivery, maximizing skin exposure, providing eye protection and eye care, careful attention to thermoregulation, maintaining adequate hydration, promoting elimination, and supporting parent-infant interaction.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Infant Mortality Statistics, 28 384 infants died in the United States in 2005. On examining the state of the science in providing end-of-life care for newborns, it is important to examine the practice of providing compassionate and dignified palliative care at the end of life. The purpose of this research study was to examine the barriers to and facilitators of providing a quality end-of-life care in one large Midwestern tertiary NICU. SUBJECTS: A convenience sample of 50 NICU registered nurses from a Level III Midwestern Facility participated. METHODS: A quantitative, prospective, cross-sectional design was used. Data were collected with the Neonatal Palliative Care Attitude Scale questionnaire. RESULTS: Five barriers and 8 facilitators to end-of-life care practice in the NICU were identified. The 5 barriers were the nurses' inability to express opinions values and beliefs regarding palliative care (M = 2.98, SD = 1.30), less than ideal physical environment (M = 2.70, SD = 1.31), technological imperatives (M = 3.22, SD = 1.11), parental demands (M = 3.46, SD = 1.07), and, finally, lack of education (M = 2.86, SD = 1.44). The 8 facilitators were supportive medical staff (M = 3.60, SD = 1.29), parental involvement of decisions (M = 3.76, SD = 1.17), parents informed of options (M = 3.32, SD = 1.22), support from medical team when palliative care is implemented (M = 3.20, SD = 1.28), staffing (M = 3.60, SD = 1.29), time spent with dying baby (M = 3.52, SD = 1.31), policies/guidelines supporting palliative care (M = 3.76, SD = 1.19), and available counseling (M = 3.566, SD = 1.26). CONCLUSIONS: Barriers and facilitators continue to exist within neonatal end-of-life care. There is significant importance for NICU nurses to recognize and understand the barriers to and facilitators of providing end-of-life care within their specific unit. Further research is warranted regarding implementation of end-of-life care education in the NICU to improve patient care.",

This study focuses on the emotional reactions during the transition to home from the NICU for parents who participated in one such support group.Parents were interviewed 4 to 6 months after discharge of their baby from hospital.Themes from these interviews included anxiety and concern about the baby's readiness for discharge, concerns about the risks of further illness and rehospitalization, and whether the parent felt prepared sufficiently to care for his or her baby at home. Recalling their time in the nursery was distressing for parents, but despite this, they identified that positive staff interactions helped them through the hardest times in the NICU.The support group was reported to be effective and helpful for parents. Parents often maintained social contact with other parents and recalled advice and supportive information from the group as needed. Participants recommended that the support group continue to assist other parents.",

The multidisciplinary program team conducted a literature review and then designed and conducted a survey to assess the educational requirements of nurses regarding family-integrated care. A nursing workshop was then developed on the basis of the literature review, staff survey responses, and discussions with staff and parents who had experienced having an infant in the NICU. Six months into the program, the contribution of the nursing workshop content to nurses' participation in the family-integrated care program was evaluated using individual structured interviews. Nurses who were interviewed described the workshop as valuable and reported that the information provided on nursing versus parental responsibilities in infant care, the parent experience in the NICU, and developmental care strategies was the most useful. Interviewees also identified the need for ongoing staff mentoring to maximize their ability to facilitate family-integrated care. Specific education for nurses facilitates family-integrated care in the NICU.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: To evaluate whether the establishment of a dedicated percutaneously inserted central catheter (PICC) team is associated with reduced risk of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) in the neonatal intensive care unit. Subjects: Participants were extremely low-birth-weight infants admitted to a level IIIC neonatal intensive care unit. Design: A before- versus after-intervention study design was implemented. Intervention group participants were admitted after April 2006 when the PICC team was established, dedicating line insertion and maintenance responsibilities to the team. Historical control group participants were managed via the previous standard of care. Methods: The risk of CRBSI over time was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analyses and the effect of the PICC team on CRBSI risk was evaluated after controlling for covariables in a Cox proportional hazards model. Principal Results: Mean birth weight and gestational age were similar between groups. After controlling for gestational age, central line days, respiratory support days, and average daily census at time of admission in a Cox regression model, the intervention group had 49% lower risk of CRBSI in patients who had a central line in place for more than 30 days. There was no difference in rate of CRBSI between groups that had central lines of short or intermediate duration (<30 days). Conclusions: Catheter-related bloodstream infection in extremely low-birth-weight infants requiring long-term central venous access was reduced by nearly half after the institution of a dedicated PICC team in the neonatal intensive care unit. Standardizing PICC line placement is important, but standardizing line maintenance is essential to improvement of CRBSI rates.",

Up to 50% of neonates with TEF/EA will have Vertebral anomalies (V), Anal atresia (A), Cardiac anomalies (C), Tracheoesophageal fistula (T), Esophageal atresia (E), Renal anomalies (R), and Limb anomalies (L) (VACTERL) association, which has the potential to cause serious morbidity. Purpose: Timely management of the neonate can greatly impact the infant's overall outcome. Spreading latest evidence-based knowledge and sharing practical experience with clinicians across various levels of the neonatal intensive care unit and well-baby units have the potential to decrease the rate of morbidity and mortality. Methods/Search Strategy: PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Review, and Google Scholar were used to search key words— tracheoesophageal fistula, esophageal atresia, TEF/EA, VACTERL, long gap, post-operative management, NICU, pediatric surgery—for articles that were relevant and current. Findings/Results: Advancements in both technology and medicine have helped identify and decrease postsurgical complications. More understanding and clarity are needed to manage acid suppression and its effects in a timely way. Implications for Practice: Knowing the clinical signs of potential TEF/EA, clinicians can initiate preoperative management and expedite transfer to a hospital with pediatric surgeons who are experts in TEF/EA management to prevent long-term morbidity. Implications for Research: Various methods of perioperative management exist, and future studies should look into standardizing perioperative care. Other areas of research should include acid suppression recommendation, reducing long-term morbidity seen in patients with TEF/EA, postoperative complications, and how we can safely and effectively decrease the length of time to surgery for long-gap atresia in neonates.",

Parental touch, especially during skin-to-skin contact (SSC), has potential to reduce adverse consequences. Purpose: To examine relationships between parental engagement and salivary oxytocin and cortisol levels for parents participating in SSC intervention. Methods: A randomized crossover design study was conducted in a neonatal intensive care unit; 28 stable preterm infants, mothers, and fathers participated. Parental engagement was measured using the Parental Risk Evaluation Engagement Model Instrument (PREEMI) prior to hospital discharge. Saliva samples for oxytocin and cortisol levels were collected 15-minute pre-SSC, 60-minute during-SSC, and 45-minute post-SSC. Results: Data were analyzed using Pearson's correlation to measure relationships between parental engagement composite scores and salivary oxytocin and cortisol levels. A significant negative correlation between paternal engagement and paternal oxytocin levels ( r = −0.43; P = .03) and a significant negative correlation between infant oxytocin levels and maternal engagement ( r = −0.54; P = .004) were present. Adjusted linear regression models demonstrated that as infant oxytocin levels increased during SSC, maternal engagement scores significantly decreased at discharge (β = −.04; P = .01). Linear regression, adjusting for infant oxytocin and cortisol levels, showed that as paternal oxytocin levels increased, there was a significant decrease in paternal engagement (β = −.16; P = .03) and as paternal cortisol levels increased, there was a significant decrease in paternal engagement (β = −68.97; P =.05). Implications for Practice: Significant relationships exist between parental engagement and salivary oxytocin and cortisol levels. Defining parent engagement facilitates identification of parent risks and needs for intervention to optimize preterm outcomes. Implications for Research: The PREEMI can serve as a standardized instrument to examine parent engagement.",

These respondents were representative of both the United States and Canada, with 29 US states represented. The majority of respondents (95.7%) reported current nursing employment in a level III NICU.: Survey research was used in this exploratory study.

Data analysis included descriptive statistics and univariate analysis of variance assessing for significant differences in specific neonatal feeding practices reported. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the qualitative data reported.: The outcome measures included the survey responses to the questions asked about the implementation of an enteral feeding protocol and various aspects of enteral feeding practices in the NICU.: The majority of participants (60.9%) reported that an enteral feeding protocol was implemented in practice, but that it was inconsistently followed because of individual physician or nurse practice patterns, or highly individualized feeding plans required of specific clinical care needs of the patient. Respondents indicated that gestational age was the leading criteria used to initiate feedings, and patent ductus arteriosis treatment was the primary contraindication to enteral feedings. The leading factor reported to delay or alter enteral feedings was the presence of gastric residuals. Survey data indicated that other contraindicating factors to enteral feeding are variable across NICUs and, as reported, are often inconsistent with the current research published to date.: Research is needed to provide a foundation on which to develop effective enteral feeding protocols that are appropriate for the diversity of infants cared for in the NICU. Such research findings will culminate in the development and implementation of enteral feeding protocols in the NICU, which will result in improved nutrition, growth, and development outcomes for premature infants.",

Selecting appropriate and supportive interventions begins with a thorough assessment of the infant's skills. The Early Feeding Skills (EFS) tool is a clinician-reported instrument developed to assess the emergence of early feeding skills and identify domains in need of intervention. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify the factor structure of the EFS and test its psychometric properties, including internal consistency reliability and construct validity. Methods: EFS-trained interprofessional clinicians in 3 settings scored 142 feeding observations of infants 33 to 50 weeks' postmenstrual age. Redundant and rarely endorsed items were removed. Factor analysis methods clustered items into subscales. Construct validity was examined through the association of the EFS with (1) concurrently scored Infant-Driven Feeding Scale-Quality (IDFS-Q), (2) infant birth risk (gestational age), and (3) maturity (postmenstrual age). Results: Principal components analysis with varimax rotation supported a 5-factor structure. The total EFS demonstrated good internal consistency reliability (Cronbach α= 0.81). The total EFS score had construct validity with the IDFS-Q ( r =−0.73; P &lt; .01), and with gestational age of a subsample of premature infants ( r = 0.22; P &lt; .05). Implications for Practice: As a valid and reliable tool, the EFS can assist the interprofessional feeding team to organize feeding assessment and plan care. Implications for Research: The strong psychometric properties of the EFS support its use in future research.",

    "abstract": "Bathing the newborn infant is controversial, ranging from how and when to give the newborn their first bath, whether to bathe newborns at all in the initial days of life, and how to approach bathing the hospitalized premature and full-term infant in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).To review relevant literature about bathing newborn infants, as well as examine the controversies about bathing NICU patients including the use of daily chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) baths.Despite studies showing that temperature can be maintained when the first bath was at 1 hour after delivery, there are benefits from delaying the bath including improved breastfeeding. Tub or immersion bathing improves temperature, and is less stressful. It is not necessary to bathe infants every day, and premature infants can be bathed as little as every 4 days without an increase in skin colonization. No differences have been reported in skin parameters such as pH, transepidermal water loss, and stratum corneum hydration whether the first and subsequent baths are given using water alone or water and a mild baby cleanser. Concerns about systemic absorption suggests caution about widespread practice of daily CHG bathing in the NICU until it is known whether CHG crosses the blood-brain barrier, particularly in premature infants.Research regarding bathing practices for NICU patients should be evidence-based whenever possible, such as the benefits of immersion bathing. More evidence about the risks and benefits of daily CHG bathing is needed before this practice is widely disseminated.",

    "abstract": "Background: Although oxygen is the most widely used therapeutic agent in neonatal care, optimal oxygen management remains uncertain. Purpose: We reviewed oxygen physiology and balance, key studies evaluating oxygen saturation targets, and strategies for oxygen use in the neonatal intensive care unit. Results: Oxygen is a potent vasodilator involved in the transition at birth to breathing. Supplemental oxygen is administered to reverse/prevent hypoxia; however, excessive oxygen can be toxic owing to the formation of reactive oxygen species. Current neonatal resuscitation guidelines recommend using room air for term infants in need of support, with titration to achieve oxygen saturation levels similar to uncompromised term infants. In premature infants, targeting a higher oxygen saturation range (eg, 91%-95%) may be safer than targeting a lower range (eg, 85%-89%), but more evidence is needed. In combined analyses, lower oxygen saturation levels increased mortality, suggesting that the higher target may be safer, but higher targets are associated with an increased risk of developing disorders of oxidative stress. Implications for Practice: Need for supplemental oxygen should be assessed according to the American Heart Association guidelines. If appropriate, oxygen should be administered using room air, with the goal of preventing hypoxia and avoiding hyperoxia. Use of oximeter alarms may help achieve this goal. Pulmonary vasodilators may improve oxygenation and reduce supplemental oxygen requirements. Implications for Research: Implementation of wider target ranges for oxygen saturation may be more practical and lead to improved outcomes; however, controlled trials are necessary to determine the impact on mortality and disability.",

    "abstract": "Working in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) can be both rewarding and stressful. Stressors can outweigh satisfiers, leading to job dissatisfaction and turnover. Nurse retention remains a problem, particularly for nurses within the first year of employment.The purpose of this study was to examine current nurse stressors, satisfiers, and coping processes in the NICU.Seventy-two neonatal nurses from 3 Magnet facilities in North Carolina completed the ICU Stressors Survey, the Ways of Coping Scale, demographic data questions, and free-text questions in Qualtrics, a secure online survey system. Questionnaires were analyzed using protocols developed and validated by instrument developers, and quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS statistical software. Free-text responses were analyzed using iterative coding and thematic grouping.Most nurses thought that NICU nursing was stressful, but they coped well with work stress. Nurses felt confident in their knowledge and patient care abilities and were not stressed by the NICU environment. Inadequate staffing was the most common stressor. Coping strategies were aimed at task completion. Nurses wanted better teamwork on their units. Nurses felt more respected by their peers and families than by their immediate supervisors and physicians.Attention to staffing patterns is paramount. Team-building activities may help foster mutual respect and collegiality among the nursing staff and between disciplines. Research investigating creative staffing patterns would be helpful. Interprofessional research may also reduce stressors and enhance team performance.",

For each of the 25 nipple types, 15 nipples of that type were tested by measuring the amount of infant formula extracted in 1 minute by a breast pump. Mean milk flow rate (mL/min) and coefficient of variation (CV) were calculated for each nipple type. Comparisons between nipple types were made within brand and within category (eg, Slow, Standard). A cluster analysis was conducted to identify nipples of comparable flow.A total of 375 individual nipples were tested. Milk flow rates varied widely, from 0.86 to 37.61 mL/min. There was also a wide range of CVs, from 0.03 to 0.35. Packing information did not accurately reflect the flow rates of bottle nipples. The cluster analysis revealed 5 clusters of nipples, with flow rates from Extra Slow to Very Fast.These data can be used to guide decisions regarding nipples to use for feeding infants with medical complexity in the hospital and after discharge.Research on infant feeding should consider the flow rate and variability of nipples used, as these factors may impact findings.",

Studies among the neonatal population are lacking. According to the Gate Control Theory, it is expected that applied mechanical vibration will have a summative effect with standard nonpharmacologic pain control strategies, reducing behavioral and physiologic pain responses to heel lancing.To determine the safety and efficacy of mechanical vibration for relief of heel lance pain among neonates.In this parallel design randomized controlled trial, eligible enrolled term or term-corrected neonates (n = 56) in a level IV neonatal intensive care unit were randomized to receive either sucrose and swaddling or sucrose, swaddling, and vibration for heel lance analgesia. Vibration was applied using a handheld battery-powered vibrator (Norco MiniVibrator, Hz = 92) to the lateral aspect of the lower leg along the sural dermatome throughout the heel lance procedure. Neonatal Pain, Agitation, and Sedation Scale (N-PASS) scores, heart rate, and oxygen saturations were collected at defined intervals surrounding heel lancing.Infants in the vibration group (n = 30) had significantly lower N-PASS scores and more stable heart rates during heel stick (P = .006, P = .037) and 2 minutes after heel lance (P = .002, P = .016) than those in the nonvibration group. There were no adverse behavioral or physiologic responses to applied vibration in the sample.Applied mechanical vibration is a safe and effective method for managing heel lance pain. This pilot study suggests that mechanical vibration warrants further exploration as a nonpharmacologic pain management tool among the neonatal population.",

    "abstract": "Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is the persistence of a fetal shunt between the pulmonary artery and the aorta. This structure normally closes in the first 3 days after birth; however, closure is delayed in up to 80% of infants born at 25 to 28 weeks of gestation. Persistent PDA results in pulmonary overcirculation and systemic hypoperfusion.The purpose of this article is to review pathophysiology and treatment options for PDA.A literature review was conducted using PubMed, CINAHL, and Google Scholar (2013-2018). Search terms included neonate, PDA, pathophysiology, pharmacotherapy, nursing, ligation, indomethacin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen (paracetamol).Optimal treatment remains contentious. Options include conservative/medical, pharmacologic, and surgical management. Conservative/medical management includes mild fluid restriction, increased airway pressures, and supportive care. Pharmacologic treatment is accomplished using indomethacin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen. Surgical intervention is by direct closure or by percutaneous ligation. Treatment may be prophylactic, presymptomatic, or symptomatic. Long-term morbidities associated with PDA include chronic lung disease, retinopathy of prematurity, and neurodevelopmental delay.Absence of a universal scoring system for severity of PDA limits accuracy of comparisons among research studies. Lack of a consistent definition also makes it difficult to aggregate data for meta-analyses. Adoption of a consistent scoring system for hemodynamic significance would facilitate comparisons of outcomes among research studies.Clinicians should be aware of treatment options for PDA and their implications on neonatal outcomes. For nurses, anticipation of possible side effects is important for performance of focused assessments.",

Father involvement with neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) infants reduces the length of stay. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore and describe involvement, confidence, and beliefs of fathers of infants who were hospitalized in the NICU and discharged home in order to begin to investigate NICU father involvement from a longitudinal perspective. Methods: This exploratory qualitative study was conducted 4 to 5 years after the initial NICU stay using telephone interviews. Fathers who participated in this study were selected from participants of a previous NICU study. Qualitative analysis was conducted using standard procedures for grounded theory. Results: Nineteen fathers participated in the study. The major themes were “It was scary,” “Just be there,” “It was rough,” “It's not about yourself,” “A special bond,” and “Almost a treat.” The fathers reported that the NICU providers, nurses, and staff helped them to overcome uncertainty and lack of knowledge, which helped them improve their confidence and involvement during the NICU stay. Implications for Practice: Fathers see nurses as a source of support. Nurses can encourage fathers to visit regularly and participate in infant care activities. NICU presence aids fathers in developing confidence and knowledge in parenting during their child's infancy, which can set the stage for ongoing involvement. Implications for Research: Future work should continue to focus on longitudinal studies of fathering and the role of the NICU in encouraging involvement and parenting readiness.",

Society does not recognize this type of loss, and parental grieving is particularly complicated and intense. Purpose: The aim of this study was to describe and understand the experiences of parents in relation to professional and social support following stillbirth and neonatal death. Methods: This was a qualitative study based on Gadamer's hermeneutic phenomenology. Twenty-one semistructured interviews were carried out. Inductive analysis was used to find themes based on the data. Results: Twenty-one parents (13 mothers and 8 fathers) from 6 families participated in the study. The analysis identified 2 main themes: (1) “professional care in dealing with parents' grief,” with the subthemes “important aspects of professional care,” “continuing of pathways of care”; and (2) “effects of social support in parental grief,” including the subthemes “the silence that surrounds grieving parents,” “family and other children: a key element,” and “perinatal loss support groups: a reciprocal help.” Implications for Practice: Counseling and support according to parents' requirements by an interdisciplinary team of professionals educated in perinatal loss and ethical family-centered care is needed. A social support system for families is necessary to avoid negative emotional consequences. Implications for Research: Further research is needed to analyze midwives' and nurses' experience as facilitators to improve parental grief and the difficulties experienced by the family, other children, and friends of parents with perinatal loss in providing support.",

    "abstract": "Background: The current US opioid crisis has resulted in a significant increase in opioid use disorder among pregnant and parenting women. Substance use disorders, in general, are highly stigmatized conditions. Stigma serves as a well-documented global barrier to health-seeking behaviors and engagement in healthcare. While extensive research exists on the stigma of mental illness, few studies have explored the stigma experienced by families impacted by neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Purpose: Therefore, the purpose of this article is to explore the role of stigma in the care of families impacted by NAS. Methods: In this article, we present a discussion about the effects of stigma on this patient population and provide exemplars of stigma experiences from our previous research and the existing literature. Findings/Results: Mothers of infants with NAS faced the challenges of overcoming stigma as they were often ostracized, excluded, and shamed. Nurses who provide care for these women and their infants have reported experiencing ethical distress, moral distress, and compassion fatigue. Implications for Practice: Greater awareness of the impact of opioid use on the maternal–child population has resulted in numerous educational offerings for healthcare providers; however, this alone is not adequate to end stigma. Fortunately, promising tools and methods have been developed for assisting nurses with addressing stigma in a manner that can be both nonconfrontational and highly effective. Implications for Research: Future research is needed to explore and evaluate the efficacy of various existing strategies for counteracting harmful stigma in this patient population.",

    "abstract": "Background: Infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are exposed to many stressors. There is growing evidence that chronic stress early in life has long-term neurodevelopmental implications. Skin-to-skin care (SSC) is an intervention used to reduce stress in the NICU. Clinical Question: In premature infants in the NICU, what is the available evidence that SSC improves short-term physiologic stress outcomes compared with incubator care? Search Strategy: PubMed and CINAHL were searched for terms related to SSC, stress, physiology, and premature infants. Of 1280 unique articles, 19 were identified that reported on research studies comparing SSC with incubator care in the NICU and reported stress-related physiologic outcome measures. Results: Although there have been some mixed findings, the research supports that SSC improves short-term cardiorespiratory stress outcomes compared with incubator care. The evidence is clearer for studies reporting stress hormone outcomes, with strong evidence that SSC reduces cortisol and increases oxytocin levels in preterm infants. Implications for Practice and Research: SSC is safe and has stress-reducing benefits. SSC should be considered an essential component to providing optimal care in the NICU. More research is needed to determine the timing of initiation, duration, and frequency of SSC to optimize the stress-reducing benefits. Future research should include the most fragile infants, who are most likely to benefit from SSC, utilize power analyses to ensure adequate sample sizes, and use sophisticated data collection and analysis techniques to more accurately evaluate the effect of SSC on infants in the NICU.",

METHODS A retrospective review of medical records of infants treated for NAS due to in utero exposure to methadone and/or illicit drugs such as heroin or morphine was performed for birthweight, neonatal abstinence scores, infant and maternal illicit drug exposure history, maternal methadone dose (if any), and details of treatment. Length of stay was the primary outcome measure. RESULTS Forty-six infants met the inclusion criteria. The median LOS of infants treated with methadone versus OMP was not significant (P > 0.05). Prolonged LOS was associated with larger pharmacological treatment doses required to control withdrawal symptoms, larger maternal methadone dose, and increased birthweight. After adjusting for these factors, exposure to opioids in utero, maternal nicotine use, hospital of treatment, severity of withdrawal symptoms, and foster care placement were not significantly associated with LOS in univariate or multivariate analyses. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that infants treated with OMP or methadone have similar LOS. Longer LOS is associated with both higher maternal methadone doses and higher opioid treatment dose requirements after birth. The potential effect of maternal methadone dose on neonatal LOS should be considered when treating expectant mothers on methadone maintenance therapy.",

Data were extracted from the research records of the research lactation consultant that addressed all aspects of mothers' reported breastfeeding experiences. The principal investigator identified the main issues of the conversations, entered these into a summary chart, and then assigned appropriate categories.

Categorical data were analyzed descriptively using the crosstabs function.Barriers to the successful establishment and maintenance of breastfeeding during discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), at discharge home, and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months corrected age, or until weaning from breastfeeding. Changes in breastfeeding barriers across the 6 time periods were also determined.At NICU discharge, low milk volume was the greatest breastfeeding barrier. During the period from discharge home and at 1 month and 3 months, the infants' compromised physical status was the largest barrier to breastfeeding. Data from the 6- and 12-month time periods indicated that the provision of complementary feeding was the greatest barrier to breastfeeding; it was most prevalent in the period following NICU discharge and before discharge home. Across all time periods, nipple and breast problems were most prevalent at NICU discharge, whereas poor technique was a barrier at 1 month. Mothers' compromised emotional status was greatest at discharge from the NICU and diminished thereafter.Results from this study indicate the need to address time-period-specific barriers encountered during the breastfeeding experience of mothers of VLBW infants.",

    "abstract": "Infant sleep position impacts the development of head shape. Changes in infant sleep position, specifically the movement toward supine sleep, have led to a redefinition of normal head shape for infants in the United States. Historically, a dolichocephalic (elongated) head shape was the norm. Currently the norm has changed to a more brachycephalic (shorter and broader) shape. Since the American Academy of Pediatrics' Back to Sleep Campaign, the incidence of positional plagiocephaly has increased dramatically with a concurrent rise in the incidence of torticollis. Infants who require newborn intensive care, particularly premature infants, are more prone to positional plagiocephaly and dolichocephaly. Both can be prevented or minimized by proper positioning. The infant with an abnormal head shape requires careful evaluation; treatment varies according to the etiology. Craniosynostosis, a less common but pathological etiology for plagiocephaly, should be considered in the diagnostic process. Successful treatment of positional plagiocephaly and dolichocephaly includes systematic positioning changes to overcome the mechanical forces of repetitive positioning, physical and/or occupational therapy to treat underlying muscle or developmental challenges, and in some cases, molding helmet therapy.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE To determine the relationship of prenatal attachment and other selected perinatal contextual variables (method of delivery, maternal self-reported health, depression, infant birthweight, need for neonatal intensive care unit [NICU] admission) to postnatal attachment in mothers of twins. SUBJECTS Two hundred fourteen women were initially recruited from a national mothers of twins support group for a study of maternal prenatal attachment. Of the 168 women who agreed to be contacted after delivery, 142 returned completed questionnaires (82.7% response rate), with 139 study-eligible women included in the analysis for this report. STUDY DESIGN Correlational design with longitudinal follow-up at 1 month after expected delivery date. METHODS Self-administered, mailed questionnaires completed by women with twin gestations prenatally and postnatally 1 month after their expected delivery dates. Descriptive analysis, correlations, and regression equations were performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The Maternal Attachment Inventory. PRINCIPLE RESULTS A modest correlation was found between prenatal and postnatal attachment (r = 0.38, P < 0.001). Prenatal attachment and postpartum depression explained 26.1% of the variance in postnatal attachment (F = 5.06, P < 0.001). Depression, method of delivery, and need for admission to the NICU had moderator effects on the relationship between prenatal attachment and postnatal attachment. The addition of these interaction terms nominally increased the adjusted R2 to explain 27.9% to 29.6% of the variance in postnatal attachment. CONCLUSIONS Although the study findings support a modest relationship between prenatal and postnatal attachment in mothers of twins, maternal depression was also significant in explaining postnatal attachment. Postpartum depression, having a cesarean delivery, and the experience of a NICU admission for 1 or both twins further influenced the relationship between prenatal attachment and postnatal attachment. When fostering attachment in mothers of twins, nurses should assess for symptoms of depression and pay particular attention to those women who have an infant requiring a NICU admission.",

While vast changes in the neonatal intensive care unit have occurred over the last 2 decades, little research has addressed the loss of exposure to maternal voice for the preterm infant. To address this gap, we compared studies that directly investigated effects of exposure to maternal voice on preterm infants. Studies reviewed were conducted between 1972 and 2007. All presented recordings of maternal voice at sound levels above current recommendations, and few of the findings reached statistical significance. Some potentially positive developmental effects were indicated. Future study of the effects of exposure to maternal voice on preterm infants using recommended sound levels is needed.",

Study Design: Following staff orientation, a policy of DCC for 45 seconds was instituted for all eligible babies born between 28 and 32 weeks' gestational age, and later to all those younger than 33 weeks. Results: Of 480 babies, 349 (73%) were eligible for DCC. Of these, 236 (68%) received DCC. Monthly compliance rates to DCC protocol in eligible babies ranged from 18% to 93%. There was no significant difference in demographic measures or rates of delivery room ventilation between eligible babies who did or did not receive DCC. Delayed cord clamping was associated with less hypothermia, higher initial hemoglobin levels, and less necrotizing enterocolitis, with a trend toward lower 1-minute Apgar scores and less blood pressure support. Conclusions: The DCC protocol is feasible in preterm babies with reinforcement and education. It appears practical, safe, and applicable, and has minimal impact on immediate neonatal transition, with possible early neonatal benefits.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To identify infant and maternal characteristics associated with the pace of progression from the first oral feeding to complete oral feeding. SUBJECTS: One hundred forty-two stable premature infants who were fully or partially gavage feeding immediately after birth (29 to 34 weeks gestational age at birth). DESIGN: Exploratory secondary analysis. METHODS: Data are from an ongoing randomized clinical trial of a developmental maternally administered intervention (Hospital to Home Transition–Optimizing Premature Infant's Environment) for mother-infant dyads at high social-environmental risk. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Oral feeding progression (transition time from the first attempt to complete oral feeding). SAMPLE CHARACTERISTICS: The convenience sample of preterm infants consisted of 48.6% male infants; the mean gestational age at birth was 32.4 weeks and mean birth weight 1787 g; and African American mothers (47.9%; n = 80) and Latina mothers (52.1%; n = 83). PRINCIPLE RESULTS: Multivariable linear regression results showed that, on average, the number of days for infants of Latina mothers to achieve complete oral feeding was 2.43 days more than for infants of African American mothers. In addition, lower birth weight and lower postmenstrual age at first oral feeding were associated with longer feeding progression. Higher infant morbidity was correlated with longer feeding progression. CONCLUSION: Infants with Latina mothers, lower birth weight, lower postmenstrual age at first oral feeding, and higher morbidity scores had a longer transition from first to complete oral feeding. Identification of infants at risk for delayed transition from first to complete oral feeding may allow for the development and testing of appropriate interventions that support the transition from gavage to complete oral feeding.",

Research has demonstrated that while the environment of the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is capable of providing extraordinary lifesaving measures following birth, the experience may be disruptive to several key aspects of early development, placing infants at risk for adverse behavioral, cognitive, and emotional outcomes.This article provides rationale for the concept of Infant Medical Trauma in the NICU (IMTN) as a means of describing this unique stress experience. A triad of cumulative early life NICU experiences (stress, parental separation, and pain) is proposed to influence an infant's swinging neurodevelopmental pendulum amid the potential outcomes of risk and resilience.Creating language that describes the infant experience brings meaning and calls caregivers and parents to action to consider strategies that may improve long-term health. Actively seeking opportunities to decrease the allostatic load of at-risk infants may support an infant's pendulum to swing toward a path of resilience, thereby moderating his or her early life adverse experience.",

Controversies remain surrounding the definition of hsPDA, the population of infants requiring treatment, the appropriate timing and method of treatment, and the outcomes associated with PDA and its therapies.This integrative literature review focuses on diagnostic and treatment recommendations derived from the highest levels of evidence.PubMed and CINAHL were searched using key words \"neonatal\" and \"patent ductus arteriosus\" to discover the highest levels of evidence surrounding diagnosis, treatment methods, and outcomes.The lack of consensus surrounding the diagnosis and clinical significance of PDA hinders meta-analysis across studies and confounds understanding of appropriate management strategies. Novel biomarkers, pharmaceutical choices, and transcatheter closure methods are expanding diagnostic and treatment options.Infants weighing less than 1000 g are at highest risk. Prophylactic closure is no longer recommended, although early asymptomatic therapy is still preferred by some to avoid prolonged pulmonary overcirculation or decreased renal and gut perfusion. Conservative treatment measures such as fluid restriction and diuretic administration have not consistently proven effective and are in some instances detrimental. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors are effective but have adverse renal and mesenteric effects. Oral ibuprofen is associated with lower instance of necrotizing enterocolitis.Well-defined staging criteria would aid in comparison and meta-analysis. Trials that include a control group that receives no therapy may help separate the outcomes associated with prematurity from those associated with PDA.",

As an Australian regional level 3 NICU that was randomized to the intervention group, we aimed to explore parent and staff perceptions of the FICare program in our dual occupancy NICU.This qualitative study took place in a level 3 NICU with 5 parent participants and 8 staff participants, using a post implementation review design.Parents and staff perceptions of FICare were explored through focus group methodology. Thematic content analysis was done on focus group transcripts.Parents and staff perceived the FICare program to have had a positive impact on parental confidence and role attainment and thought that FICare improved parent-to-parent and parent-to-staff communication. Staff reported that nurses working with families in the program performed less hands-on care and spent more time educating and supporting parents.FICare may change current NICU practice through integrating and accepting parents as active members of the infant's care team. In addition, nurse's roles may transition from bedside carer to care coordinator, educating and supporting parents during their journey through the NICU.Further research is needed to assess the long-term impact of FICare on neonates, parents, and staff.",

Bacteroides, an early member of the intestinal microbiome, is necessary for breaking down complex molecules within the intestine and function to assist the body's immune system in fighting against potentially harmful pathogens. Little is known about the colonization pattern of Bacteroides in preterm infants during the early neonatal period.This study measured Bacteroides colonization during the early neonatal period in a population of preterm infants, based on clinical factors including mode of birth, antibiotics, and nutrition.Bacterial DNA was isolated from 144 fecal samples from 29 preterm infants and analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Analyses included liner mixed models to determine which clinical factors affect Bacteroides colonization of the infant gut.We found that infants born via vaginal canal had a higher rate of increase in Bacteroides than infants born via cesarean section (P < .001). We did not find significant associations between antibiotic administration and differences in nutritional exposures with Bacteroides colonization.These findings highlight the significant influence of mode of birth on Bacteroides colonization. While mode of birth is not always modifiable, these study findings may help develop interventions for preterm infants born via cesarean section aimed at overcoming delayed Bacteroides colonization.Greater study of the intestinal microbiome and the clinical factors relevant to the preterm infant is needed so that interventions may be developed and tested, resulting in optimal microbial and immune health.",

    "abstract": "Breastfeeding preterm infants is shown to have important health benefits for both infants and mothers. A positive relationship between mothers and healthcare teams and supportive practices tend to facilitate maternal competence and promote early initiation of breastfeeding within neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).The aim of this study was to understand attitudes and behaviors of healthcare professionals toward breastfeeding practices and supporting mothers of preterm infants.This study adopted an ethnographic research design that involved 135 hours of participant observation over a 6-month period and semistructured interviews of 10 nurses and 5 physicians.Data analysis suggests that while staff members agree with the benefits of breastfeeding for preterm infants, the actual implementation of a breastfeeding policy within NICUs is problematic. Three key themes emerged. The first described the contradiction that exists between the staff beliefs and behaviors in relation to breastfeeding and supporting mothers. The second theme was related to staff working conditions, which described the lack of institutional support and barriers to supporting breastfeeding. The final theme of controlling relationships captured the essence of the practitioner to mother association. Together, these elements revealed a situation whereby the staff appeared more preoccupied with addressing the task of caring for the babies than with supporting mothers in feeding and subsequently caring for their preterm children.The institutional barriers to breastfeeding promotion within NICUs should be addressed by healthcare providers. Actions that provide a supportive environment within NICUs for both mothers and nurses are essential to improve the overall quality of care.Future research may include an examination of hospital policies and practices of promoting breastfeeding for preterm infants.",

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) first published safe sleep recommendations for parents and healthcare professionals in 1992. In 1994, new guidelines were published and they became known as the \"Back to Sleep\" campaign. After this, a noticeable decline occurred in infant deaths from SIDS. However, this number seems to have plateaued with no continuing significant improvements in infant deaths.The objective of this review was to determine whether nurses provide a safe sleep environment for infants in the hospital setting. Research studies that dealt with nursing behaviors and nursing knowledge in the hospital setting were included in the review.A search was conducted of Google Scholar, CINAHL, PubMed, and Cochrane, using the key words \"NICU,\" \"newborn,\" \"SIDS,\" \"safe sleep environment,\" \"nurse,\" \"education,\" \"supine sleep,\" \"prone sleep,\" \"safe sleep,\" \"special care nursery,\" \"hospital policy for safe sleep,\" \"research,\" \"premature,\" \"knowledge,\" \"practice,\" \"health care professionals,\" and \"parents.\"The review included research reports on nursing knowledge and behaviors as well as parental knowledge obtained through education and role modeling of nursing staff. Only research studies were included to ensure that our analysis was based on rigorous research-based findings. Several international studies were included because they mirrored findings noted in the United States. All studies were published between 1999 and 2012.Healthcare professionals and parents were included in the studies. They were primarily self-report surveys, designed to determine what nurses, other healthcare professionals, and parents knew or had been taught about SIDS.Integrative review.Thirteen of the 16 studies included in the review found that some nurses and some mothers continued to use nonsupine positioning. Four of the 16 studies discussed nursing knowledge and noncompliance with AAP safe sleep recommendations. Eleven of the 16 studies found that some nurses were recommending incorrect sleep positions to mothers. Five of the 16 studies noted that some nurses and mothers gave fear of aspiration as the reason they chose to use a nonsupine sleep position.In the majority of the studies, the information was self-reported, which could impact the validity of the findings. Also, the studies used convenience sampling, which makes study findings difficult to generalize.The research indicates that there has been a plateau in safe sleeping practices in the hospital setting. Some infants continue to be placed in positions that increase the risk for SIDS. The research also shows that some nurses are not following the 2011 AAP recommendations for a safe sleep environment. Clearly, nurses need additional education on SIDS prevention and the safe sleep environment, and additional measures need to be adopted to ensure that all nurses and all families understand the research supporting the AAP recommendation that supine sleep is best. Further work is needed to promote evidence-based practice among healthcare professionals and families.",

Facilitated tucking supports the preterm infant and is a valuable strategy to manage neonatal pain. Alternative nonpharmacologic approaches to pain management in neonates include nonnutritive sucking and kangaroo care.In premature and critically ill infants, what is the effect of facilitated tucking on pain behaviors in those who received the intervention compared with those who did not, and what alternative interventions for nonpharmacologic pain reduction are supported by strong research evidence?Studies were identified in the PubMed database using the search terms: facilitated tucking, NICU, pain management, preterm infant, and nonpharmacologic. Studies were included if they were peer reviewed, were published in the last 5 years (or considered classic), and if they used experimental study designs.The studies identified demonstrate that facilitated tucking reduces the expression of pain in premature infants. As a whole, existing research supports the use of facilitated tucking for infants as early as 23 weeks' gestational age, during painful procedures including: heel stick, endotracheal suctioning, and venipuncture.Pain management interventions are necessary to decrease the potentially unfavorable consequences of early exposure to pain and to promote positive outcomes. Additional research is indicated to discover the effects of nonpharmacologic interventions in neonates with severe illness, congenital abnormalities, and/or assisted breathing.",

Nevertheless, infants still die in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) every day. Despite existing standards of care, some aspects of end-of-life care (EOLC) are still not delivered consistently. Little is known about how NICU nurses' individual experiences affect EOLC.The purpose of this study was to explore, through lived and told stories, the affective, interactional, and meaning-related responses that NICU nurses have while caring for dying infants and their families. Coping strategies and changes in practice were also explored.Thirty-six members of the National Association of Neonatal Nurses submitted written narratives about an EOLC experience during which the nurse experienced strong emotions.Narrative analysis revealed many affective responses, but 3 were the most frequent: responsibility, moral distress, and identification. Coping methods included healthy and less healthy strategies, such as colleague support, informal and formal debriefing, practicing intentional gratefulness, avoidance, and compartmentalization. Changes in practice identified were universally described as professional growth through the use of reflective practice.Educators should discuss the range of emotions experienced by caregivers related to EOLC and healthy coping strategies and encourage the use of reflective practice as a facilitator of professional growth. Nurse leaders should promote supportive environments in NICUs and ensure debriefing opportunities for nurses who have recently cared for a dying infant. Future research should focus on formulating interventions to utilize debriefing with NICU nurses and perhaps the development of EOLC mentors.",

    "abstract": "Background: The relationship between behavioral states (alert, sleep, drowsy, and crying) and oral feeding efficiency in preterm infants is not well understood. Purpose: To determine the relationship between behavioral states and feeding efficiency in preterm infants. Methods: This correlational study was conducted as a secondary analysis from a randomized controlled trial. Medically stable preterm infants born between 29 and 34 weeks' gestational age participated. Baseline data from the randomized controlled trial (week 0), 1 minute prior to feeding, were used. Behavioral states were coded by 2 blinded coders. Oral feeding efficiency (mL/min) was calculated as the amount of intake over the first 10 minutes of feeding. Results: Data from 147 infants were included. The proportion of time spent in alert states (β = .76, F = 11.29, P ≤ .05), sleep states (β = −1.08, F = 25.26, P ≤ .05), and crying (β = 1.50, F = 12.51, P ≤ .05) uniquely predicted oral feeding efficiency. Implications for Practice: Comprehensive assessment of behavioral states and infant characteristics for oral feeding readiness is crucial. Alert states are optimal for oral feeding. Forced oral feeding when infants are sleeping should be avoided. Infants in crying or drowsy states prior to feeding should be closely evaluated. Sleeping or drowsy infants may benefit from interventions (eg, oral sensory stimulation, nonnutritive sucking, or multisensory intervention) to support transition to alert states prior to feeding. Implications for Research: Future research should evaluate behavioral states prior to and during feeding and their relationship to oral feeding efficiency.",

    "abstract": "In 2014, more than 10% of all births in the United States were preterm (born at <37-weeks' gestation). These high-risk infants will often spend weeks to months within the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), where noise levels can easily reach 120 decibels adjusted (dBA) on a regular and sometimes consistent basis. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that NICU sound levels remain below 45 dBA to promote optimal growth and development.The purpose of this evidence-based brief is to critically appraise the literature concerning preterm infant response to noise within the NICU as well as the use of noise interventions to improve health outcomes for the vulnerable preterm infant population.Systematic searches of databases included the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PubMed, and Science Direct. Included studies were appraised and then synthesized into a narrative summary.Twenty studies met inclusion criteria for this review. While there are numerous methods that have been shown to reduce noise levels within the NICU, most NICU noise levels remain consistently above the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations. Studies that assessed interventions found that staff reeducation was critical to sustaining appropriate noise levels.Implementing interventions with rigorous attention to initial and continued staff education with engagement and ownership is recommended. This review identifies gaps in intervention studies targeting vulnerable NICU populations.While noise interventions show promise in the NICU, additional focused research is needed to further strengthen the evidence and inform clinical practice.",

A prospective, observational cohort pilot study using telemedicine to improve transition was implemented in a quaternary level IV NICU. Purpose: (1) To assess, identify, and resolve patient care concerns in the immediate postdischarge period. (2) To improve caregiver knowledge and care practices. Design Methods: Caregivers of medically complex infants participated in telemedicine visits with neonatal providers within 1 week of discharge. Providers reviewed infant health, equipment use, and outpatient follow-up. Video was used to visualize the infant, home environment, and care practices. Caregivers completed a postvisit satisfaction survey. Results: Ninety-three visits were performed from May 2015 to March 2017. Seventy-six percent of visits were postsurgery patients. Seventy-eight postdischarge issues were identified: medication administration (13%), respiratory (19%), feeding (33%), and surgical site (35%). Fifty percent of caregivers reported that telemedicine visits prevented an additional call or visit to a clinician; 12% prompted an earlier visit (n = 93). Caregiver satisfaction rating was high. Median estimation of total mileage saved by respondents was 1755 miles. Conclusions: Postdischarge telemedicine visits with complex surgical NICU graduates identify clinical issues, provide caregivers with support, and save travel time. Advanced practice nurses are instrumental in patient recruitment, with patient visits, and in providing postdischarge continuity of care. Barriers to implementation were identified. Implication for Practice and Research: A randomized controlled study is warranted to measure the value of telemedicine visits for specific patient cohorts.",

Nurses play a central role in encouraging parental attachment with their infant.This study was carried out with the aim of understanding NICU nurses' lived experiences of family participation in family-centered care.This interpretative phenomenological study was conducted on the basis of Heideggerian philosophy. The data were collected using semistructured interviews and field notes and analyzed through the 7-stage Diekelmann, Allen, and Tanner approach.Two overarching themes emerged including \"mother's centrality in the care chain\" and \"fathers; the lost ring in the care chain\" each of which consisted of 3 and 4 subthemes, respectively. Interviews indicated that in Iran's NICUs, conditions for the presence of parents were appropriate for the mothers and they were encouraged to engage in family-centered care but the fathers' participation was limited due to traditional attitudes, cultural-religious background, and difficulties relating to the hospitals' organizational rules.Fathers' participation in family-centered care seems to be enhanced through providing facilities, altering the organizational rules, attempting to modify traditional social attitudes, and educating parents and nurses.Future research should explore the experience of mothers and fathers of infants in NICU in Iran to achieve a comprehensive understanding of their role in family-centered care.",

Neonatal palliative care (NPC) has potential benefits for parents, staff, and patients, yet evidence suggests that implementation and utilization of organized NPC services are low.The purpose of this study is to answer the clinical question: In neonatal intensive care, what evidence can be used to guide implementation of palliative care protocols?A literature search was conducted using CINAHL (Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature), PubMed, and the Cochrane Library databases. Publications with a focus on neonates, neonatal intensive care unit, and implementation or evaluation of a palliative care protocol, team, or educational intervention were retained.The search yielded 17 articles that fit with the following themes: NPC protocols or teams (n = 8), healthcare team needs (n = 3), and barriers to implementation (n = 6). Approaches to NPC implementation were varied, and outcome data were inconsistently reported. Healthcare team members cited a need for education and consistent, ethical delivery of NPC. Common barriers were identified as lack of NPC education, poor communication, and lack of adequate resources such as staff and space.Successful team approaches included standardized order sets to initiate NPC, NPC education for staff, and references to NPC guidelines or protocols. Barriers such as lack of interdisciplinary cooperation, lack of appropriate physical space, and lack of education should be addressed during program development. Further research priorities for NPC include seeking parent perceptions, shifting focus from mostly end-of-life to an integrated model, and collecting outcome data with rigor and consistency.",

    "abstract": "Background: Establishing vascular access is a common neonatal intensive care unit procedure. The extended dwell peripheral intravenous (EPIV) catheter is a 6-cm and 8-cm silicone catheter for peripheral vein insertion, which is a newer vascular access device than peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) and peripheral intravenous (PIV) catheter. Extended dwell peripheral intravenous catheters have been widely used in adults but evidence in neonates is lacking. Purpose: To explore indwell time, success rate, catheter-associated complications, and cost among EPIV catheters, PICCs, and PIV catheters in neonates. Methods: We retrospectively compare patient demographics, indwell time, success rate, and catheter-associated complications, and analyze the rate of hyaluronidase-treated intravenous (IV) fluid extravasation on neonates who had an EPIV catheter, a PICC, or a PIV catheter in a level III neonatal intensive care unit. We also estimate the insertion cost of these 3 vascular access devices on the basis of our hospital charges. Results: Extended dwell peripheral intravenous catheters were inserted in 432 neonates with an indwell time of 4.0 ± 2.3 (mean ± SD) days. Peripherally inserted central catheters were inserted in 202 neonates with an average indwell time of 7.3 ± 4.4 (mean ± SD) days, which was longer than EPIV catheters ( P &lt; .001). Peripherally inserted central catheters had a higher success rate of 83.6% than 71.7% of EPIV catheters, meaning succeeded in lasting through the completion of therapy ( P = .001). Peripherally inserted central catheters were associated with 4 cases of life-threatening complications; none was seen in the EPIV catheter group. The incidence of hyaluronidase-treated IV fluid extravasation was less in EPIV catheter recipients (1.2%) than in the PIV catheter recipients (3.9%) ( P = .004); none was in the PICC group. Cost savings were noted with using an EPIV catheter. Implications for Practice: Extended dwell peripheral intravenous catheter is a feasible option for neonatal vascular access. Implications for Research: These data provide a baseline for future studies to explore the efficacy and effectiveness of EPIV catheter in the neonates.",

However, use of vascular access devices is not without danger of failure. Catheter securement adhesives are being evaluated among adult populations, but to date, studies in neonatal settings are scant.This research describes the prevalence of peripherally inserted central catheter failure related to catheter securement before and after the introduction of tissue adhesive for catheter securement. The identified modifiable risks might be used to evaluate efficacy, to innovate neonatal practice and support future policy developments.This was a retrospective observational analysis of routinely collected anonymized intravenous therapy-related data. The study was carried out at the tertiary neonatal intensive care unit (112 beds) of the Women's Wellness and Research Center of Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.The results showed that the use of an approved medical grade adhesive for catheter securement resulted in significantly less therapy failures, compared with the control group. This remains significant after adjusting for day of insertion, gestational age, birth weight, and catheter type.In parallel with currently published international literature, this study's findings support catheter securement with an octyl-based tissue adhesive in use with central venous catheters. When device stabilization is most pertinent, securement with tissue adhesive is a safe and effective method for long-term vascular access among the neonatal population.",

While mostly affecting preterm neonates, full-term neonates, especially those with congenital heart disease, are also at risk. Although the exact pathogenesis of NEC remains elusive, three major factors, a pathogenic organism, enteral feedings, and bowel compromise, coalesce in at-risk neonates to produce bowel injury. Initiation of the inflammatory cascade likely serves as a common pathway for the disorder. Clinical signs and symptoms range from mild feeding intolerance with abdominal distension to catastrophic disease with bowel perforation, peritonitis, and cardiovascular collapse. Vigilant assessment of at-risk neonates is crucial. When conservative medical management fails to halt injury, surgical intervention is often needed.

    "abstract": "Purpose This is a prospective audit to determine the frequency of resuscitation interventions in the clinical setting and to compare self-reports of clinical performance with the existing Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) and Canadian National Guidelines for Neonatal Resuscitation. SUBJECTS Fifty-six level I, II, and III hospitals in Canada participated. Any infant requiring resuscitation, as defined by the need for at least positive pressure ventilation (PPV), was eligible for inclusion (n = 783 resuscitations). DESIGN AND METHODS A prospective self-report audit was chosen and data were collected over a 6-month period in 1998. The audit focused on the use of PPV, intubation, chest compressions, free-flow oxygen, or medications during the resuscitation. The infant's temperature at the end of resuscitation was also noted. The data were analyzed with descriptive statistics. The composition of the resuscitation team and their NRP certification status were recorded. PRINCIPAL RESULTS The need for resuscitation was not anticipated in 76% of the cases (596 of 783). Errors in the sequencing of care, such as delays in initiating PPV, provision of chest compressions before or without establishing an airway and ventilatory support, and administering naloxone before PPV, were reported. Resuscitations attended by a team of NRP certified providers had improved sequencing when compared with those in which only some individual providers were certified. Chest compressions were provided in 8% of the cases (65 of 783). Medications were used in 14% (113/783) of all cases. Providers in level I hospitals performed chest compressions more frequently than those in level II and III settings. At the end of the resuscitation, 27% of the infants were hypothermic (142 of 520), and 25% were hyperthermic (128 of 520). Overall, 52% were out of the normal neutral range. CONCLUSIONS Clear differences between the NRP guidelines and actual clinical practice were shown. A high rate of unanticipated resuscitations, delivery room medications, and chest compressions was described. Postresuscitation hypothermia or hyperthermia were common. Improved sequencing was noted when the entire resuscitation team was NRP certified. Certification in NRP does not assure competency, nor does it ensure compliance with established standards of care.",

Prenatal alcohol exposure is one of the leading causes of birth defects, developmental disorders, and mental retardation in children. The fetal central nervous system is particularly vulnerable to alcohol; this vulnerability contributes to many of the long-term disabilities and disorders seen in individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure. Diagnoses associated with prenatal alcohol exposure include fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial fetal alcohol syndrome, fetal alcohol effects, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, and alcohol-related birth defects. Once diagnosed, early intervention improves the long-term outcome of affected children. Without documentation of maternal alcohol use, a diagnosis, and consequently treatment, is often difficult to attain.

Sucking was measured using a chin strain gauge and breathing was measured with a nasal thermistor. Behavioral characteristics included behavior state, measured using the Neonatal Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program (NIDCAP) behavior state scale, and feeding efficiency. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Characteristics of NS (number of suck bursts, sucks/burst, suck burst length) and breathing (number of breath bursts, breaths/burst, breath burst length), as well as behavior state during bottle feedings and feeding efficiency (percent of prescribed formula consumed, formula consumed/minute of feeding). PRINCIPAL RESULTS NS waves were smoother and more regular than NNS waves. Time to onset and duration of the first non-nutritive suck burst were positively correlated with time to onset for the first nutritive suck burst. Prefeeding NNS had no statistically significant effect on characteristics of breathing or on any other characteristics of NS. Behavioral state during feedings and feeding efficiency were not affected by prefeeding NNS. CONCLUSIONS In this sample, the use of prefeeding NNS did not affect NS, breathing during feeding, or select behavioral characteristics of feeding.",

    "abstract": "Craniofacial birth defects are the fourth most common congenital anomaly in newborns. Cleft lip and cleft palate (CL/CP) are the most common and immediately recognizable craniofacial anomalies. Some are diagnosed prenatally on ultrasound; more often, they are first noted in the delivery room. The infant may have a cleft that is unilateral, bilateral, complete, or incomplete, and it may involve the lip only, the palate only, or both. Cleft lip and/or cleft palate are often isolated nonsyndromic occurrences; however, when associated with other abnormal physical findings, a recognizable syndrome may be present. Part 1 of this 2-part article describes the incidence of CL/CP. The embryology of the face, lip, and palate are reviewed to enhance the understanding of the timing, complexity, and factors that may influence the development of this lesion. The emerging genetic links, environmental influences, and potential teratogens that may interact to contribute to CL/CP are discussed. Part 2 of this series will provide clinicians with tools to perform a focused risk assessment and obtain a detailed family and pregnancy history to evaluate for known associated risk factors for CL/CP. The article provides a guide for a systematic physical examination of infants with CL/CP. Careful assessment for other midline defects or physical findings consistent with associated syndromes is also discussed. Pictorial examples of a variety of forms of CL/CP are provided to enhance understanding of the spectrum of this defect. Treatment and long-term complications of CL/CP are reviewed with an emphasis on family support, identifying educational resources, and counseling.",

SUBJECTS Twenty-seven mothers whose preterm infants were part of a larger study of feeding readiness participated. DESIGN A qualitative, descriptive approach was used to explore mothers' experiences in feeding their preterm infants after hospital discharge. METHODS A convenience sample of mothers of preterm infants were interviewed 2 to 3 weeks after hospital discharge. Data were generated by semi-structured interview and analyzed by searching for thematic patterns in the data. Mothers were asked to describe their experiences feeding their infants, their perceptions of how their infants' feeding ability had changed since discharge, and the meanings they gave to these changes. The interviews were audiotaped and transcribed. Agreement of themes between the investigators was achieved. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Three themes emerged from the interviews: interpreting infant behaviors, managing the feeding process, and realizing knowledge gaps. PRINCIPAL RESULTS Mothers struggle with infant feeding in the first few weeks after discharge and experience a period of transition before comfort develops. CONCLUSIONS Nursing interventions should include anticipatory guidance to mothers about feeding their infants after discharge and more concrete information regarding infant cues of hunger and satiation. Follow-up visits after discharge should include a review of the current feeding regimen, information regarding feeding progression, and reinforcement about changing infant behaviors as the preterm infant approaches 40 weeks postmenstrual age.",

    "abstract": "Infants requiring neonatal intensive care are often placed prone during their acute illness. After hospital discharge the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends supine sleep position to reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Little is known about nursing knowledge and practice regarding best sleep positions for infants as they transition from neonatal intensive care to home. Objective To explore and describe neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) nurses' knowledge and practice in the NICU, and to determine the content of parent instruction regarding infant sleep position at discharge. Study Design This survey was conducted in 2 phases. In Phase I, a questionnaire was designed and completed by 157 neonatal nurses currently practicing in Level III and IV NICUs in the state of New York. After content analysis of responses and item revisions, a panel of experts reviewed questionnaire items. Phase II involved completion of the final questionnaire by 95 NICU nurses in 4 additional hospitals. The combined results of Phase I and II are reported. Results Of 514 questionnaires distributed, 252 (49%) were completed and analyzed. During NICU hospitalization, nurse respondents identified prone position as the best general sleep position for preterm infants (65%) followed by either prone or side-lying (12%). The nurses' assessment of the infants' readiness for supine sleep position at the time of NICU discharge varied. Most nurses responded that preterm infants were ready to sleep supine anytime (29%), close to discharge (13%), when maintaining their body temperature in an open crib (25%), between 34 to 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) (15%), after 37 weeks PMA (13%), and when the infant's respiratory status was stable (6%). Typical sleep positions chosen for full-term infants in the NICU were supine (40%), side or supine (30%), all positions (18%), side (8%), prone or side (3%), and prone (1%). Frequently cited reasons to place full-term infants to sleep prone were: reflux (45%), upper airway anomalies (40%), respiratory distress (29%), inconsolability (29%), and to promote development (17%). At NICU discharge, 52% of nurses instructed parents to place their infants in the supine position for sleep. The most common nonsupine sleep positions recommended by nurses at discharge were either supine or side (38%), and exclusive side positioning (9%). Conclusions Nearly 95% of respondents identified a nonsupine sleep position as optimal for hospitalized preterm infants. Further, only 52% of neonatal nurses routinely provide discharge instructions that promote supine sleep positions at home. This study suggests that nursing self-reports of discharge teaching practices are inconsistent, and in some cases in direct conflict with the national \"Back to Sleep\" recommendations, which emphasize that the supine position is the safest position for healthy full-term and preterm infants after hospital discharge.",

It involves the lower extremities, the lumbar and coccygeal vertebrae, and corresponding segments of the spinal cord. This is a rare disorder, and true pathogenesis is unclear. The etiology is thought to be related to maternal diabetes, genetic predisposition, and vascular hypoperfusion, but no true causative factor has been determined. Fetal diagnostic tools allow for early recognition of the syndrome, and careful examination of the newborn is essential to determine the extent of the disorder. Associated organ system dysfunction depends on the severity of the disease. Related defects are structural, and systematic problems including respiratory, cardiac, gastrointestinal, urinary, orthopedic, and neurologic can be present in varying degrees of severity and in different combinations. A multidisciplinary approach to management is crucial. Because the primary pathology is irreversible, treatment is only supportive.",

It is frequently used in circumstances when continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) might otherwise have been used. Limited evidence is available to support the specific role, efficacy, and safety of HHFNC in newborns. This evidence suggests that HHFNC provides inconsistent and relatively unpredictable positive airway pressure, but may be effective in the treatment of some neonatal respiratory conditions while being more user-friendly for caregivers than conventional CPAP. Concerns regarding infection risks have resulted in one major HHFNC device being withdrawn from the market before being recently reintroduced. Caution should be exercised in the use of HHFNC in neonates (eg, by limiting its use to relatively lower flows and to relatively larger neonates, while collecting and closely monitoring safety and efficacy data) until further evidence is available to clearly delineate its role, as well as to support its safety and efficacy.",

    "abstract": "There is a direct relationship between nonsupine sleeping and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Premature infants are at greater risk for SIDS and are often cared for in nonsupine positions during the course of hospitalization. Healthy premature infants should be placed supine for sleep before discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and parents receive specific instruction about infant sleep position and other risk factors for SIDS. Most published literature addressing nursing practices for SIDS reduction reflects practices with the healthy newborn population.To examine and describe NICU nurses' knowledge of SIDS risk-reduction measures, modeling of safe infant sleep interventions prior to discharge, and inclusion of SIDS risk reduction in parent education.Convenience sample of nurses practicing in level II and III NICUs located in 2 Middle Atlantic States.A prospective survey design was used for the study. The 14-item questionnaire was developed by a team of neonatal clinical experts and distributed via site coordinators to nurses in 19 NICUs.A total of 1080 surveys were distributed and 430 (40%) NICU nurses completed the survey. The majority of nurses (85%) identified the American Academy of Pediatrics SIDS risk-reduction strategies for safe sleep. The investigators found that age, years of nursing and neonatal nursing experience, and educational preparation did not significantly contribute to the practice of \"supine-only\" position for sleep for infants in NICUs. The study revealed that nurses frequently position healthy preterm infants supine for sleep when weaned to an open crib (50%). Others wait one to a few days before discharge (15%) and some never position supine for sleep (6%). Stuffed toys are removed from cribs 90.5% of the time. For term infants without major medical complications, 45.5% of surveyed nurses continued to use positioning aids/rolls in infants' cribs. The most common reasons nurses cited to position preterm infants side-lying or prone in a crib were fear of aspiration (29%), infant comfort (28%), and infant safety (20%). NICU nurses educated parents about SIDS and reduction strategies, using various media. At discharge, 73% of the nurses verbally communicated with parents, 53% provided printed literature, and 14% used audiovisual aids with parents.NICU nurses are in influential positions to educate parents and model SIDS risk-reduction strategies. This study supports other published research that points to inconsistencies in nursing practice regarding implementation of methods to reduce the risk of SIDS.",

SUBJECTS: Mechanically ventilated preterm infants weighing 1500 g or less admitted to a regional level III NICU in the Gulf South between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2009. DESIGN: Retrospective descriptive. METHODS: Oral care with mothers' own milk was implemented as part of the VAP-prevention bundle in the neonatal intensive care unit in the fourth quarter of 2007. Using retrospective deidentified data retrieved from the electronic medical record, the primary and secondary outcome variables were collected among eligible infants (≤1500 g) admitted January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2007 (before implementation) and January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2009 (after implementation). Sample characteristics, including infant gestational age, birth weight, and gender, as well as maternal age, type of delivery, and incidence of maternal chorioamnionitis, were also collected. Data analysis included frequencies and distributions to summarize sample characteristics and variables of interest. Appropriate tests for differences were conducted on outcome variables between the before and after groups of the human milk oral care intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The feasibility outcome variable included nursing compliance with the oral care procedure. The safety outcome variable included record of any adverse events associated with the oral care procedure. The efficacy health outcomes included the rate of positive tracheal aspirates, positive blood cultures, the number of ventilator days, and length of stay. RESULTS: Infant age (26.1–26.6 weeks) and weight (840–863 g) were similar in the before (n = 70) and after (n = 68) sample subjects. There were no statistically significant differences in ventilator days, χ² (46, n = 115) = 46.22, P = .46, and length of stay, χ2 (75, n = 115) = 78.78, P = .36, between groups. Although the rate of positive tracheal aspirates and positive blood cultures reduced after implementation of oral care with mothers' own milk, these differences were not statistically significant (U(47) = 250, z = −7.1, P = .48; U(47) = 217.5, z = −1.44, P = .15). CONCLUSIONS: There were no statistically significant differences in the rates of positive tracheal aspirates and blood cultures after implementation of oral care with mothers' own milk. The findings of this study suggest that using mothers' own milk as part of the VAP-prevention bundle is a feasible and safe practice; however, further research is needed to determine the immunological benefits of this practice.",

The majority of pulmonologists surveyed (78%) reported using nocturnal oxygen saturations as the primary indication for weaning. Only 8% of pulmonologists reported using a standardized protocol. Half of the respondents reported weaning diuretics prior to oxygen. The factors considered prior to initiating oxygen weaning included growth (96%), vital signs (85%), hospitalizations (68%), and echocardiograms (59%). Fewer respondents (21%) reported using chest x-ray findings. The minimum oxygen saturation in room air required to take a patient off oxygen ranged from 90% to 95%, with a mean of 93% (SD = 1.74).: Pediatric pulmonologists reported a wide range of practice patterns in weaning premature infants from supplemental home oxygen. Very few respondents reported using a standardized protocol. There is no consensus about whether to wean diuretics or oxygen first. The majority of providers use nocturnal oxygen saturations as an indication for readiness to wean. Growth is an important factor for oxygen weaning considered by most pulmonologists surveyed. Consensus guidelines and subsequent evaluation of such guidelines are needed to ensure the safety of this growing population of infants.",

SUBJECTS Eleven preterm infants with a mean gestational age of 31.6 weeks without anomalies or conditions associated with neurodevelopmental delay composed the sample. METHODS On days 5–7 of life, the following infant responses were simultaneously recorded in response to naturally occurring sound stimuli in the NICU: real-time measurements of heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturations; sympathetic-mediated sweating via SC; and behavioral responses using the Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program naturalistic observation. Baseline sound levels (BSL, <55 dBA) and high sound levels (HSL, >65 dBA) were measured to index patterns of response during a nonhandling period preceding care. RESULTS Mean heart rate during precare was directly associated with higher SC increases to sound stimuli (r[10] = 0.697, P = .017). The SC during HSL was significantly higher than that during BSL (P < .0001). Males demonstrated higher SC increases to sound stimuli than females (P = .030). Changes in SC induced by increases in sound intensity were associated with lower attention responses (r[10] = −0.92, P < .0001) and lower summated behavioral responses (r[10] = −0.59, P = .054). CONCLUSION SC provides a noninvasive, sensitive measure of sympathetic arousal that may not be apparent in behavioral cues or states, or determined by standard physiological responses alone.",

OBJECTIVE: he objective of this research was to measure baseline noise level in an NICU, compare it to recommendations of international bodies, and evaluate the impact of a noise awareness educational program (NAEP) as a strategy to decrease it. DESIGN/METHODS: Means of hourly average noise levels in decibels (dB) were compared with the recommendations and pre- and postintervention (P = .05). RESULTS: Mean noise-level preintervention was significantly higher than recommended (58.15 vs 45 dB; P < 0.001). The participation rate in NAEP was excellent and most participants thought that the content was relevant and would change their practice. Overall, at first glance, the impact of the NAEP was not as expected: the noise levels increased nonsignificantly postintervention (58.15 vs 58.46 dB; P < .181). However, a significant increase in activity level (number of nurses and patient) was thought to be responsible for the lack of significance postintervention. After controlling for these variables, it was demonstrated that the noise level did significantly decrease postintervention (6.33 vs 5.42 dB per RN & 4.68 vs 4.08 dB per patient, P < .000). CONCLUSION: Although the efficacy of the program was significantly limited by an increase in general activity, it raised staff awareness and had important effects reflected by the significant decrease in mean noise level after standardization and the participant's comments.",

However, despite the well-documented benefits of infant massage, infants born very preterm (≤30 weeks' gestation) are often excluded from these studies, leaving neonatal clinicians and families without guidance in how to provide a stress-reducing supplemental touch. Much of the touch in the NICU is a procedural touch, and infants born very preterm often miss out on comforting touch stimulation. A systematic review of the literature is presented with an aim to explore the research that examines the various comforting touch therapies used on hospitalized NICU infants born very preterm within the first few days of postnatal life. The purpose of this review was to identify appropriate stress-reducing comforting touch techniques for physiologically fragile very preterm infants in order to inform and provide guidance to neonatal clinicians and families.",

Subjects: Seven parents of preterm infants who were born at 24 to 26 weeks' gestation at a western Canadian tertiary NICU. Design: Qualitative, interpretive description, semistructured interviews. Methods: The first author conducted interviews with both parents together or the mother alone. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed. Results: Three main themes related to decision making, culture shock, and relationships emerged: (1) decision making before and in the NICU: moving beyond information, (2) culture shock in the NICU: plunging into a strange land, and (3) relationships in the NICU: enduring in a strange land. Conclusions: Although information and decision making are interconnected and fundamental to parents' experiences of their preterm baby's NICU stay, they also identified the culture and language of the NICU and genuine relationships formed with healthcare professionals as significantly influencing their experiences.",

Concept analysis can clarify an overused or vague concept and promote mutual understanding by providing a precise operational definition. Mentoring is a concept more fully used by other fields, such as business, than in nursing and may not always translate well for use in nursing. Therefore, clarifying the meaning of the existing concept of mentoring and developing an operational definition for use in nursing are aims of this concept analysis. Mentoring is broadly based and concentrates on developing areas such as career progression, scholarly achievements, and personal development. Mentoring relationships are based around developing reciprocity and accountability between each partner. Mentoring is seen related to transition in practice, role acquisition, and socialization, as a way to support new colleagues. Mentorship is related to nurses' success in nursing practice linked to professionalism, nursing quality improvement, and self-confidence.",

Purpose: To describe the frequency and length of maternal and paternal viewing of their hospitalized neonates via a Web camera. Methods/Search Strategy: A total of 219 mothers and 101 fathers used the Web camera that allows 24/7 NICU viewing from September 1, 2010, to December 31, 2012, which included 40 mother and father dyads. We conducted a review of the Web camera's Web site log-on records in this nonexperimental, descriptive study. Findings/Results: Mothers and fathers had a significant difference in the mean number of log-ons to the Web camera system (P = .0293). Fathers virtually visited the NICU less often than mothers, but there was not a statistical difference between mothers and fathers in terms of the mean total number of minutes viewing the neonate (P = .0834) or in the maximum number of minutes of viewing in 1 session (P = .6924). Patterns of visitations over time were not measured. Implications for Practice: Web camera technology could be a potential intervention to aid fathers in visiting their neonates. Both parents should be offered virtual visits using the Web camera and oriented regarding how to use the Web camera. Implications for Research: These findings are important to consider when installing Web cameras in a NICU. Future research should continue to explore Web camera use in NICUs.",

Individuals with high self-efficacy emulate professional resiliency and possess a strong sense of optimism in their ability to adapt, overcome, and persevere in the professional arena. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify characteristics that encourage mentoring relationships between neonatal nurse practitioner (NNP) students and preceptors, as well as student perceptions of mentoring relationships. Methods: A 29-item survey composed of demographic items, the Freeman Mentoring Survey, the Self-Efficacy Scale, and the Confidence Scale, along with qualitative questions, was disseminated to NNP students enrolled in their final clinical practicum course from August to October 2014. Results: Students who sought out their own preceptor \"by choice\" reported higher self-efficacy scores (P = .046) and mentoring scores (P = .047). Students who perceived their preceptor as a mentor (91%) expressed readiness to assume the role of advanced practice registered nursing after graduation. An average of 37.2 hours is required for a student to adapt to a clinical site and preceptor. Implications for Practice: Mentorships between preceptors and NNP students, grounded in the provisions of trust, stability, encouragement, and hope, facilitate positive self-efficacy for the student learner. All NNPs must commit to the integration of mentoring programs in the clinical setting as well as seek out teaching-coaching opportunities with NNP students to demonstrate their unwavering commitment to the NNP workforce. Implications for Research: Further investigation of the impacts of mentoring relationships upon job satisfaction, recruitment and retention, the teaching-coaching role, and scholarship activities of actively practicing NNPs is indicated.",

Nurses scored a standardized video-recorded infant presenting with opioid withdrawal before and after training.Nearly twice as many nurses scored at target (Finnegan score of 8) posttraining (34.7%; mean error = 0.559, SD = 1.4) compared with pretraining (18.8%; mean error = 1.31, SD = 1.95; Wilcoxon, P < .001). Finnegan scores were significantly higher than the target score pretraining (mean = 9.31, SD = 1.95) compared with posttraining (mean = 8.56, SD = 1.40, Wilcoxon P < .001); follow-up assessments reverted to pretraining levels (mean = 9.16, SD = 1.8). Score dispersion was greater pretraining (variance 3.80) compared with posttraining (variance 1.96; Kendall's Coefficient, P < .001) largely due to score disparity among central nervous system symptomology.Education, clinical guidelines, and a restructured scoring tool increased consistency and accuracy of infant withdrawal-assessments among neonatal nurses. However, more than 60% of nurses did not assess withdrawal to the target score immediately following the training period and improvements did not persist over time.This study highlights the need for more objective tools to quantify withdrawal severity given that assessments are the primary driver of pharmacological management in neonatal drug withdrawal.Video Abstract available at https://journals.lww.com/advancesinneonatalcare/Pages/videogallery.aspx.",

Articles published within the past 10 years were included.Epidemiological trends of CS in the United States indicate that maternal syphilis infection and CS are on the rise. Risk factors include ethnicity, socioeconomic status, access to prenatal care, and sexual behaviors, as well as compliance with prenatal syphilis screening by prenatal providers. Risks of CS to the developing fetus begin at approximately 14 weeks. Timely treatment is necessary to minimize or eliminate mortality and morbidity.Evidence-based, interprofessional strategies, which promote a collaborative perinatal/neonatal preventative approach to care of the pregnant female, are indicated to reverse the increasing incidence of CS within the United States. Strategies prioritizing early identification and treatment of at-risk neonates are necessary to reduce/eliminate the devastating long-term consequences of CS upon this vulnerable population.The paucity of research, which focuses on CS, is most likely due to ethical concerns related to infants as research participants and provides an opportunity for future research.

    "abstract": "Infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) often require surgical intervention and maintaining normothermia perioperatively is a major concern. In our preliminary study of 31 normothermic infants undergoing operative procedures in the operating room (OR), 58% (N = 18) returned hypothermic while all 5 undergoing procedures in the NICU remained normothermic (P = .001). To describe perioperative thermal instability (temperatures lower than 36.0°C) and frequency of associated adverse events, support interventions, and diagnostic tests in infants undergoing operative procedures in the OR and the NICU. This prospective, case-control study included 108 infants admitted to the NICU who were sequentially scheduled for an operative procedure in the OR (50.93%; N = 55) or the NICU (49.07%; N = 53). Existing data from the medical record were collected about temperatures and frequency of adverse cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic events, associated support interventions, and diagnostic tests during the perioperative period. Analyses examined the relative risks and proportional differences in rates of hypothermia between the OR group and the NICU group and associated adverse events, support interventions, and diagnostic tests between hypothermic and normothermic infants. Hypothermia developed in 40% (N = 43) of infants during the perioperative period. The OR group had a higher rate of perioperative hypothermia (65.45%, N = 36; P < .001) and were 7 times more likely to develop perioperative hypothermia (P = .008) than the NICU group (13.21%, N = 7). Likewise, infants in the OR group were 10 times more likely to develop hypothermia during the intra- and postoperative periods than those in the NICU group (P = .001). The hypothermic group had significantly more respiratory adverse events (P = .025), were 6 times more likely to require thermoregulatory interventions (P < .001), 5 times more likely to require cardiac support interventions (P < .006), and 3 times more likely to require respiratory interventions (P = .02) than normothermic infants. Although infants undergoing operative procedures in the OR experienced significantly higher rates of hypothermia than those undergoing procedures in the NICU, both groups experienced unacceptable rates of clinical hypothermia. Hypothermic infants experienced more adverse events and required more support interventions during the intra- and postoperative periods than normothermic infants, thereby demonstrating the negative sequelae associated with thermal instability. As a result, a translational team of key stakeholders has been created to explore multifaceted strategies based on translation science to implement, embed, and sustain perioperative thermoregulation best practices for the infant, regardless of the operative setting.",

    "abstract": "The changes in this revised statement reflect how we now view palliative care. Sixteen clinical recommendations span identification of eligible infants before and after birth, delineate components of a palliative care program, and discuss emotional support for parents, families, and healthcare providers. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Traditional neonatal palliative care focuses on improving an infant's quality of life and may be offered concurrently with curative care to treat symptoms and minimize suffering. Through ongoing assessment of care goals, parents, nurses, and other providers weigh the benefits of shifting the goals of care from focus on cure to provision of comfort for the infant and family. End-of-life care, one aspect of palliative care, supports a peaceful, dignified death for the infant. Perinatal palliative care now extends into the realm of obstetrics, neonatology, and pediatrics. Rather than occurring only after the fetus or infant is delivered, palliative care is also offered antenatally. Further amniocentesis with genetic testing or high-level 3D ultrasound may confirm that the developing fetus has a condition with life-limiting components. Palliative care should be offered to all parents who have been informed of a life-limiting fetal diagnosis. End-of-life care should include individualized bereavement interventions for women with a high-level multiple gestation and their families when the pregnancy may need to be reduced or if there is an intrauterine fetal demise. Palliative care provided by nurses and the health team is essential1 and begins with communication between the family and all involved departments—maternal fetal medicine, obstetrics, and neonatal. In North America, a woman may choose to end the pregnancy, have an early induction, or continue the pregnancy until delivery. At delivery, there will be more choices: whether to include the NICU staff in the delivery room, provide life support and transfer to the NICU, initiate both curative and palliative efforts at once, or bypass the NICU transfer for time the parents can hold and comfort the infant.2 The statement encourages families to create a birth plan that directs in advance the type of care they wish to receive. Families appreciate when planning for palliative care starts early in the pregnancy process and is delivered by a well-trained team. NEW CHANGES The statement addresses issues around infant transport. Often parents are not told or do not hear that one transport outcome may be end-of-life care. They often interpret transport as cure. The ethical reality of separating mothers and infants when the outcome for the receiving NICU is the provision of end-of-life care has been discussed.3 All transport teams should be trained in holding difficult conversations with parents. A greater discussion is included on artificial nutrition and hydration. When an infant with a life-limiting condition is delivered and lives through the NICU period, the infant may remain in the hospital or go home. If the infant cannot suck, swallow, or digest nutrition, a decision is made regarding artificial nutrition. Healthcare personnel have written about their experiences with infants who forgo nutrition and hydration and how they cared for the infant and family. Additional resources for nurses wishing to specialize in palliative care are provided. Many countries now incorporate perinatal palliative care into their nation's healthcare delivery.4 Nurses may wish to refer to the video by Tammy Ruiz, RN.5 Neonatal nurses are essential to the provision of palliative and end-of-life care. As the professional voice of neonatal nurses, the National Association of Neonatal Nurses recommends that neonatal nurses be trained and participate in providing palliative and end-of-life care.

Recently, breast milk was found to contain stem cells that are thought to be involved in infant development.The purpose of this review was to synthesize all available research involving the characterization of breast milk stem cells to provide a basis of understanding for what is known and what still needs further exploration.The literature search was conducted between August and October 2015 using the CINAHL, PubMed, and reference list searching. Nine studies addressed characterization of human breast milk stem cells.Five research teams in 4 countries have published studies on breast milk stem cells. Current research has focused on characterizing stem cells in full-term breast milk. The amount, phenotype, and expression of breast milk stem cells are known to vary between mothers, and they have been able to differentiate into all 3 germ layers (expressing pluripotent characteristics).There is much to learn about breast milk stem cells. Given the potential impact of this research, healthcare professionals should be aware of their presence and ongoing research to determine benefits for infants.Extensive research is needed to further characterize stem cells in breast milk (full-term and preterm), throughout the stages of lactation, and most importantly, their role in the health of infants, and potential for use in regenerative therapies.",

    "abstract": "Background: Focus on skin-to-skin contact (SSC) as a family-centered care intervention in Neonatal Intensive Special Care (NISC) Units continues to increase. Previously, SSC has been shown to improve neonatal physiological stability, support brain development, and promote bonding and attachment. Limited research exists investigating SSC duration and neonatal physiological responses. Purpose: This study examined the relationship between SSC duration and the neonate's oxygen saturation, heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and temperature. Method: An observational cohort study was conducted at The Royal Women's Hospital NISC Unit in Melbourne, Australia. For each neonate participant, 1 SSC with their parent was studied (parent convenience) and neonatal physiological parameters recorded, with a bivariate correlation used to explore the relationship between the duration of SSC and the percentage of time during SSC that the neonate's physiological variables remained within a target range. Findings: No correlation existed between the duration of SSC and the neonatal physiological variables of oxygen saturation, HR, RR, and temperature. However, neonatal oxygen requirement was more often reduced across the duration of SSC. Implications for Practice and Future Research: Due to previously documented benefits to neonates physiologically from SSC, and our supportive finding that SSC reduces neonatal oxygen requirement, we believe that this study adds to the evidence to support promotion of SSC in NISC Units. The duration of SSC does not appear to negatively impact the physiological effects to the neonate. Thus, SSC should be encouraged in all NISC Units to be conducted for the length of time the parent is able. This study should be repeated with a larger sample size.",

Data were collected in 2015.The primary themes identified were looking in, persevering, holding, and finding my way. Fathers in this study described feeling like an outsider in the NICU while learning to trust strangers, protect the mother and the child, and continue to work and provide for the family. Holding for the first time is pivotal in this journey, as the moment of solidifying the connection with the child.The findings from this study bring awareness of the experiences of fathers during the NICU journey of having a premature infant. Nurses should encourage paternal participation and involvement, visitation, and facilitate kangaroo care opportunities early and often.The findings from this study allow nurses to better understand the paternal experience of having a premature infant born at less than 28 weeks. However, future research should continue to investigate the paternal experience with other gestational ages as well as the influence of stress of fathers during this experience.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this integrative review was to uncover information regarding emotional and other types of support required by mothers providing breast milk for infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). These high-risk infants are often unable to directly breastfeed and, thus, mothers need to pump their breast milk for weeks to months, which can be both a pleasing experience that increases satisfaction and infant involvement, while at the same time being an uncomfortable and tiring endeavor. Understanding this notion is important because pumping at least 8 times each day is central to increasing or maintaining breast milk production. Articles were gathered using PubMed and CINAHL databases. Forty-four sources were chosen for inclusion in this review. Search terms included \"breastfeeding,\" \"pumping,\" \"neonatal intensive care unit,\" \"emotional support,\" and \"breast milk.\" We identified that the emotional and practical support for NICU mothers is different from those of other breastfeeding mothers, especially around the development of early bonding behaviors. These mothers require significant ongoing emotional support from healthcare professionals and their partners and peers. Healthcare providers need to monitor breast milk production and provide educated encouragement that anticipates breastfeeding challenges, especially when the mother is pumping for an extended period of time while their infant is maturing in the NICU. Effective providers' support may be best provided by selectively bundling interventions to support pumping initiation and transition to direct breastfeeding.",

A quasi-control group of well-baby nursery (WBN) parents (n = 24) and prenatal obstetric clinic (PRE) parents (n = 18) were included. A single, Likert-style question measured nurses' assessment of parental comprehension with discharge teaching. Suspected limited health literacy (SLHL) was defined as the NVS score of 3 or less.Forty-three percent of parents on NICU admission and 32% at NICU discharge had SLHL (P < .01). SLHL for WBN and PRE parents was 25% and 58%, respectively. Parental age, gender, location, and history of healthcare-related employment were not associated with health literacy status at any time point. Thirty-nine percent of NICU parents and 25% of WBN parents with SLHL at time of admission/infant birth had a college education. Nurse subjective measurement of parental comprehension of discharge instructions was not correlated to the objective measurement of health literacy (P = .26).SLHL is common during peak time periods of complex health discussion in the NICU, WBN, and PRE settings. NICU providers may not accurately gauge parents' literacy status.Methods for improving health communication are needed. Studies should evaluate SLHL in a larger NICU population and across different languages and cultures.",

Prior studies of neonatal neurodevelopmental care show improved infant outcomes. Previous studies of mindfulness show improved stress and health outcomes in varied disease processes. No neonatal studies of parent training in mindfulness-based neurodevelopmental care exist. This study examines the impact of parent education and participation in mindfulness-based neurodevelopmental care on parent outcomes (stress, bonding, and satisfaction) and infant length of stay (LOS). Methods: This randomized controlled trial pilot study utilized a convenience sample of 55 parent–infant dyads. Parametric and nonparametric statistical tests examined differences in and between study groups in demographics and dependent study variables (stress, bonding, satisfaction, and LOS). Results: No statistically significant differences in parent outcomes were seen between groups. However, experimental group (EG) parents showed a significant reduction in stress scores from enrollment to discharge ( P = .012) and EG infants had significantly shorter LOS ( P = .026-.047) than control. Implications for Practice and Research: While further research to confirm study results is warranted, changes in current NICU practices to incorporate additional parent education in mindfulness-based neurodevelopmental care may help alleviate parent stress and decrease LOS that impact financial, physical, and psychosocial outcomes for patients, families, healthcare systems, and society.",

Purpose: To determine coping mechanisms utilized by NICU parents, and types of support programs parents are likely to attend. To determine whether sociodemographic and length-of-stay differences impact coping mechanisms utilized, and types of support programs preferred. Methods: A correlational cross-sectional survey design was used. The 28-item Brief COPE tool, questions about demographics and preferred support program styles, was distributed to a convenience sample of NICU parents in a level IV NICU in the southeastern United States. Results: One hundred one NICU parents used coping mechanisms, with acceptance emotional support, active coping, positive reframing, religion, planning, and instrumental support being the most common. Preferred support classes were infant development and talking with other NICU parents. Caucasians more commonly coped using active coping, planning, emotional support, acceptance, instrumental support, and venting compared with other races. Women utilized self-blame coping mechanisms more often compared with men. Younger parents were more likely to use venting and denial coping mechanisms. Parents with a shorter stay utilized self-distraction coping and preferred the class of talking with other parents. Implications for Practice: Support program preference, type of coping mechanism utilized, and sociodemographic factors may be used to guide the creation of NICU support programs. Implications for Research: Additional studies are needed to determine whether support program offering according to preferences and sociodemographic characteristics increases attendance and decreases emotional distress.",

    "abstract": "In the third edition of The Use of Human Milk and Breastfeeding in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, NANN recommends that all infants should be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life with continued breastfeeding for 1 year or more. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2014 Breastfeeding Report Card1 reveal that only 18.8% of infants are exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life, which is far below the Healthy People 2020 goal of 60.6%.1 This revised position statement includes the following recommendations for increasing breastfeeding rates: (1) prenatal lactation intervention should focus on education so that families can make informed decisions,2 (2) milk supply should be maintained through the use of a hospital-grade electric pump and daily ongoing assessment of maternal milk volume to ensure that mothers come to full milk volume and sustain milk production,3 (3) oral care with human milk should be used to promote immunological defense as well as positive oral experiences for the infant,2 (4) human milk management, prioritization of fresh milk, and optimizing human milk feedings including the use of donor milk as a bridge to mother's own milk,4 and (5) vulnerable infants should be transitioned to at-breast feedings as soon as possible prior to discharge and an electronic scale should be used to measure pre- and postweights to determine milk transfer.2 Recent research by Hallowell and colleagues5 demonstrated that only 49% of neonatal intensive care units had lactation consultants employed in the neonatal intensive care unit and nurses only reported providing breastfeeding support 13% (median) of the time during their prior shift. All neonatal nurses should possess evidence-based knowledge regarding the science of human milk, lactation, and breastfeeding. As the professional voice of neonatal nurses, NANN recommends that nurses integrate lactation support and care into their daily routines to ensure that vulnerable infants receive human milk through discharge and beyond.

Purpose: To evaluate changes in neonatal intensive care unit staff nurse beliefs, utilization, and challenges related to practice change in implementing KC as an intervention for management of procedural pain in preterm infants between 2 time points. Methods: Nurses who participated in a larger clinical trial examining the sustained efficacy of KC were asked to complete a questionnaire at 2 time points: 1- and 6 month(s) following study initiation. Identified benefits, expectations, frequency of use, and challenges related to practice change uptake were described using frequencies and percentages. Data from the 2 different time points were compared using χ 2 analysis. Results: Of the 40 nurses approached, all completed the questionnaire (19 at the 1-month and 21 at the 6-month time point). Of the sample (n = 40), 97% of participants indicated that they expected KC to provide good pain relief or better. Staff nurses reported significantly improved preconceived ideas (χ 2 = 22.68, P &lt; .01) and significantly fewer concerns (χ 2 = 22.10, P = .01) related to using KC as a pain-relieving intervention between the 2 time points. No significant differences were seen in the frequency of using KC as an intervention between time points. Implications for Research and Practice: Despite increasingly positive preconceived ideas and reduced concerns, the frequency of using KC for procedural pain relief remained unchanged. Further research addressing ways to overcome barriers to utilizing KC as an intervention for procedural pain is warranted.",

Caring for infants with NAS and their families is a significant challenge to neonatal nurses. Purpose: The purpose of this survey study was to explore attitudes and practice trends among nurses caring for infants with NAS. The study also aimed to identify any gaps in knowledge about NAS. Method: An anonymous, cross-sectional survey study was conducted using a researcher-developed questionnaire. The survey questionnaire included 20 Likert-scale questions regarding nurses' attitudes, knowledge, and practice in care of infants with NAS, 1 case study with 3 questions, and 2 open-ended questions. Nurses, including advanced practice nurses and nurse leaders, were invited to participate at a regional neonatal nursing conference in the New England area. Results: A total of 54 participants responded, the majority being white, female, non-Hispanic, and bachelor's prepared. Many nurses shared concerns regarding the setting in which infants with NAS are cared for. Nurses expressed varying attitudes regarding interacting with the mothers but generally wanted to build a partnership with them. Nurses also reported a lack of standardized and consistent practice in care for infants with NAS. Three major themes were identified from open-ended questions, including environmental issues, relationship with the mother, and inconsistency in care. Implications for Practice: Further research is needed for nurses providing care to infants with NAS. Specific education programs are needed for nurses who are caring for infants with NAS. Implications for Research: Further research is needed regarding the effects of NAS on nurses and other healthcare providers.",

NICU patients were included if Candida species, yeast-like organisms, or Malassezia species were cultured from their venous catheter tips or blood cultures.After fluconazole prophylaxis, cases of Candida spp decreased and those of Malassezia furfur emerged. We reviewed 19 cases of catheter-related M furfur colonization and 1 case of M furfur fungemia. The gestational age was 27.3 ± 2.0 weeks and birth weight was 959.2 ± 229.8 g. Hyperalimentation with lipid infusion was used in all cases. All of the neonates survived with antifungal agent use.This study highlights that prophylactic fluconazole may be an associated factor of Malassezia colonization; M furfur remains a potential concern for fungemia in the care of premature infants and thus requires our attention.Future studies should further investigate the incidence and impact of noncandidal fungal infections with fluconazole prophylaxis use in premature infants.",

    "abstract": "Background/Significance: Premature infants often experience extended stays in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) as opposed to home with parents. This prolonged separation creates a strain for both parents and infants, decreasing attachment and parental caregiving. One strategy to combat this shared stress is increasing parental participation, particularly through the use of their voices whether parents are present or not. Purpose: This Evidence-Based Practice Brief column explores the connection between mother and child, specifically the effects of maternal voice on infant autonomic stability, weight gain, and behavioral states. Methods: A systematic search of CINAHL, PubMed, and PsycInfo was used to identify studies involving the use of maternal voice intervention with preterm infants in the NICU. Results: Fifteen studies were identified. Three intervention categories emerged: (1) live maternal speech, (2) recorded maternal speech (subcategories included whether intervention content was prescribed or not), and (3) recorded maternal speech that was combined with biological maternal sounds (heart rate). Within each category, studies were organized chronologically to reflect how knowledge has changed overtime. Implications for Practice: Maternal voice has physiological as well as behavioral and emotional effect on preterm infants. Several studies found that maternal voice increased autonomic stability improving (heart rate and respirations) as well as weight gain. No negative effects were identified. Given these findings, incorporating different types of maternal voice into routine care by the bedside nurse can assist the mother in feeling more involved in her infant's care without seemingly being a distraction or obstacle to providers. Implications for Research: A major limitation for generalizability was sample size; more research is needed with larger sample sizes replicating interventions types to discern best outcomes.

Skin maintenance interventions initiated in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) have immediate and lifelong implications when the potential for infection, allergen sensitization, and altered aesthetic outcomes are considered. In addition, the high-level medical needs of extremely preterm infants demand skin-level medical interventions that too often result in unintended skin harm.We describe the use of a harm prevention, or consequence-centered, approach to skin care, which facilitates safer practice for extremely premature infants.Neonatal and pediatric Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRN) came together for monthly meetings to review the evidence around best skin care practices for extremely preterm infants, with an emphasis on reduction of skin harm. Findings were focused on the population of interest and clinical implementation strategies.Skin care for extremely preterm infants remains overlooked by current literature. However, clinical practice pearls were extracted and applied in a manner that promotes safer skin care practices in the NICU.Gentle adhesives, such as silicone tapes and hydrogel-backed electrodes, can help to reduce medical adhesive-related skin injuries. Diaper wipes are not appropriate for use among extremely preterm infants, as many ingredients may contain potential allergens. Skin cleansers should be pH neutral to the skin and the prophylactic use of petrolatum-based emollients should be avoided.Further exploration and understanding of skin care practices that examine issues of true risk versus hypothetical risk of harm.",

Research about parental experiences after PTB and on parenting stress in early childhood has focused on mothers. Purpose: To compare parenting stress between mothers and fathers 2 to 3 years after PTB and full-term birth (FTB) and to explore their memories about their stress experience, especially after PTB. Methods: Fifty-four mothers and fathers in Switzerland whose children were PTB and 65 parents of FTB completed the Parenting Stress Index 2 to 3 years after birth. We compared scores between PTB and FTB and between mothers and fathers. A random subset of parents took part in semistructured interviews that began with photo-elicitation. We analyzed the data thematically. We cross-validated and corroborated qualitative and quantitative findings about parenting stress 2 to 3 years after birth. Results: Preterm birth is stressful for parents who cannot take a child's health for granted, but stress experiences after FTB and PTB equalize within 2 to 3 years. Mothers were the primary caregivers and suffered more stress than fathers. For parents with PTB, positive communications from healthcare workers strengthened parental coping in neonatal intensive care unit and after discharge, but parents perceived discharges as early and inconsistent. Implications for Practice and Research: Interventions and new models of care improving communication with healthcare professionals, involving parents in infant care as early as possible, increasing staff support to help parents cope better, and optimizing the management of discharge need to be implemented into practice. Their impact on parenting stress on the long term needs to be investigated.",

If effective, phone apps could improve nurses' professional quality of life (QOL) defined as compassion satisfaction (CS) and compassion fatigue (CF) that includes burnout (BO) and secondary traumatic stress (STS).To test the hypothesis that use of a mindfulness phone app will increase NICU nurses' professional QOL.Using a single-group, pre/posttest design, investigators invited a convenience sample of 54 NICU nurses from a 377-bed Magnet-recognized, nonprofit hospital to complete a demographic sheet and 2 established scales: the Professional Quality of Life scale, version 5 (ProQOL5), and the Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS). The intervention was nurses' using the mindfulness phone app, Premium Moodfit , for 3 weeks.Response rate was 41% (N = 22). A paired t test for the 9 nurses who returned both pre- and posttest questionnaires showed that their STS fell from moderate to low ( P = .003), while their low BO scores ( P = .12) and moderate CS scores ( P = .4) remained stable. Wilcoxon tests confirmed results: only STS decreased ( P =.01). The hypothesis was partly supported.Using the Premium Moodfit mindfulness phone app may improve or maintain NICU nurses' professional QOL even under heightened stress. Individual nurses may independently access Moodfit and the free ProQOL5. Replication studies are warranted to confirm results and establish trends.",

The challenges of managing unstable conditions and resuscitation decisions can cause moral distress in nurses. Purpose: This study aims to determine the relationship between clinical decision-making and moral distress in NICU nurses. Methods: This cross-sectional, multicenter, descriptive correlational study involved 190 nurses working in 7 NICUs across hospitals in Khorramabad and Semnan in 2023. Data were collected using demographic questionnaires, the Clinical Decision-Making Laurie Scale (2001), and the Moral Distress Scale-Revised (MDS-R). Results: All nurses in these NICUs were female. No significant correlation was found between clinical decision-making and moral distress (r = −0.03, P = .684). The moral distress score was low. In decision-making, 57.9% of nurses exhibited intuitive analysis (understanding without a rationale). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that age, education level, and job position were significantly related to clinical decision-making; and being married and having children were inversely correlated with moral distress. Implications for Practice: 20% of nurses exhibited interpretive intuitive clinical decision-making, which involves care complexities, cognitive understanding, and task-based decisions. Nursing managers should focus on refining these decision-making strategies for NICU nurses. Implications for Research: Given the importance of clinical decision-making in the NICU, future research should use quantitative and qualitative methods to explore the decision-making processes and moral distress in NICU nurses.",

Factors that influence the initiation of KMC by bedside staff include a lack of specific education on KMC, low confidence, and hesitancy due to the infant’s clinical illness. Parents can pick up on the staff’s hesitancy and may not realize they can request to hold their baby. Purpose: The purpose of this quality improvement (QI) project was to decrease the time to the first opportunity for eligible neonates for KMC within the first 24 hours. Method: The location of the project was in a 35-bed NICU, private, and semi-private room mix. The project leads revised, updated, and received facility approval for a KMC policy. Parent education was provided via a bi-lingual pamphlet and video. KMC Champions were utilized to increase early KMC rates. Results: During the 12th week of the 3-month monitoring period, all eligible infant dyads were held within the first 24 hours, achieving the goal of 100%. Offering various educational opportunities led to enthusiastic staff participation. Additionally, reinforcement of importance and exposure to KMC led to an increase in staff buy-in. Implications for Practice and Research: Increasing staff knowledge on the importance of KMC may lead to increased confidence and competence, and a potential decrease in apprehension in offering and performing KMC. Further research needs to explore and define causes of staff hesitancy that lead to a decrease in KMC opportunities.",

Purpose: The study aims to explore parents’ experiences with Couplet Care after a caesarean section in an integrated neonatal and maternity unit, where both mother and newborn required treatment. Methods: A qualitative, semi-structured interview approach was employed. Eight mothers and 6 fathers participated, sharing their perspectives on Couplet Care through interviews conducted at a Danish hospital setting providing Couplet Care in 6 family rooms in a level II neonatal intensive care unit. Data were analyzed using content analysis inspired by Graneheim and Lundman. Results: Parents initially relied heavily on nurses, gradually gaining autonomy as their hospital stay progressed. Fathers played an essential role in caregiving, especially when mothers were immobile post-surgery. The study highlighted the importance of clear communication from nurses, which fostered parental confidence. Implications for Practice and Research: Couplet Care offers a supportive environment that promotes parental autonomy and emphasizes the critical role fathers play in caregiving. Future research should investigate the long-term effects on family dynamics and the mental health of both mothers and fathers following caesarean sections in similar settings.",

Holding is often avoided due to concerns for effects on infant temperature and for dislodging equipment. We assessed the effect of holding during TH on maternal and infant salivary cortisol levels and on infant vital signs. Prospective crossover study with infants randomized to a 30-minute session of holding on day-2 versus day-3 of TH. \"No-holding\" occurred on the alternate day at the same time. Pre- and post-holding salivary cortisol levels were compared between holding and no-holding conditions. Vital signs were collected at 2-minute intervals. Data was analyzed using mixed-effects models. Thirty-four mothers and infants were recruited. The median gestational age was 39 weeks, 16 (94%) had moderate encephalopathy and all were on morphine during TH. Salivary cortisol levels decreased after holding for infants on day-2 (P = .02) and mothers on day-2 and day-3 (P = .01). Infants held on day-2, but not on day-3, had lower heart rates, respiratory rates, and mean arterial pressures. Temperature and oxygen saturations were stable on both days. We demonstrate positive effects of holding during TH as evidenced by lower salivary cortisol for both mother and infant and decreased heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure for the infant on day-2. Further research is needed to replicate these results, to understand the lack of infant response on day-3 and to assess correlation with cumulative morphine exposure.",

Critical aspects of brain growth and development may be affected by stressor exposure. Longer term neurodevelopmental effects may result. Purpose: The aims were to examine relationships between NICU stressor scores and childhood behavior and neurodevelopment at 4 years of age in a cohort of preterm infants. Methods: We measured daily stress events with the Neonatal Infant Stress Scale (NISS) in 83 preterm infants over the first 6 weeks of life. Twenty-five of these children were followed up at 4 years of age the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Battelle Developmental Index-Screening Test (BDI-2 ST). Results: The cumulative NISS score was significantly correlated with both childhood scales in unadjusted models, but the CBCL and BDI-2 ST were not correlated with each other, suggesting they measured different constructs. Gestational age (GA) and time until full enteral feeding were the only consistent infant variables significantly associated with the CBCL scales and were selected as covariates in the regression models. Only the Score for Neonatal Physiology with Perinatal Extension (SNAPPE-II) was significantly associated with the BDI-2 ST personal-social, motor, communication, and total scales and was selected as the covariate in the regression models. Hierarchical regressions on CBCL internalizing, externalizing, and total behavior scores and BDI-2 ST scales showed relationships between the NISS and both scales, but other factors influenced these relationships, including GA, SNAPPE-II, and length of time to enteral feeding. Implications for Practice and Research: The amount and nature of neonatal stress may have impacts on neurodevelopment at 4 years of age. Limitations were the small sample size. Further larger studies of neonatal stress and neurodevelopment are warranted. Practice implications would be to ensure efforts to reduce unnecessary stress during the NICU stay and to provide developmental support as these children grow.",

The purpose of this quality improvement (QI) project is to implement a practice change that aligns the neonatal intensive care unit's (NICU) KC policy with the most recent World Health Organization guidelines, potentially improving the outcomes of preterm and very low birth-weight infants. The aims were to revise the unit's current KC policy, create a pamphlet for parent distribution regarding KC awareness, and increase the number of KC sessions by 20% and the duration in minutes of KC sessions by 50% for eligible infant-mother dyads following implementation of the updated policy. A framework developed and published by Guenther et al guided intervention readiness and delivery action sequence in this project. The assessment was made through successful workgroup participation consisting of 5 direct care registered nurses and the project leader. Pre-/post-practice change improvement interventions were assessed by comparing KC-eligible daily census, if KC was performed, and the average duration of individual KC sessions in minutes. After the implementation of an updated policy and distribution of a newly created KC parent pamphlet, there was a 58.1% increase in the number of KC sessions offered and a 140% increase in duration. Expanding the role of KC in the NICU may decrease an infant's NICU-associated morbidities, thereby decreasing healthcare costs. This project's findings may serve as a model for other units to expand their KC practices.",

However, few studies have combined silver sulfadiazine (SSD) with recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rh-EGF), which has limited application in neonatal patients, to treat extravasation. This report describes the case of a female neonate treated with SSD and rh-EGF for a skin injury caused by epinephrine extravasation. Clinical Findings: The patient (gestational age: 33 + 5 weeks) experienced extravasation during epinephrine hydrochloride infusion on the first day of hospitalization in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Primary Diagnosis: Extravasation was diagnosed 6 hours following initiation of epinephrine hydrochloride infusion, which led to specific signs, including erythema, swelling, and pain. Interventions: The patient suffered an extravasation injury in her right lower limb. Sterile puncture points were made from the edge of the leak toward the puncture center. Phentolamine was administered at the puncture site. SSD and rh-EGF were applied to the injured area and covered with Vaseline gauze. Outcomes: After treatment, the extravasation injury in the right lower limb resolved without any debridement or noticeable signs of infection. The black and purple skin discoloration decreased gradually, achieving normalization 13 days post-injury. The patient recovered completely with no scarring and was subsequently discharged. Practice Recommendations: Patients receiving infusions with high extravasation risk should be continuously and carefully evaluated for signs of dislocation, leakage swelling, or extravasation to quickly identify and prevent further injury. Combining SSD and rh-EGF may be an alternative treatment for advanced extravasation lesions in the NICU.",

Cycled lighting is an encouraging technique to stimulate formation of a 24-hour biological rhythm. Purpose: Review the literature regarding benefits of cycled lighting versus other lighting conditions for premature infants and evaluate the optimal gestational age for initiation. Data sources: Search of PubMed, CINHAL, and Google Scholar from 2012 to 2023. Study selection: Inclusion criteria covered effects of cycled lighting and focus on premature infants in the neonatal intensive care unit. Exclusion criteria were non-human studies and those that did not address the clinical question. Articles were limited to randomized controlled trials or systematic reviews. Sixteen articles were included in this review. Results: Research found inconsistent support for cycled lighting depending on the age at initiation when assessing weight gain, quality of movement, sleep and activity rhythms, ventilator days, length of stay, time to oral feeding, and irritability. Implications for practice: Infants should be kept in continuous near darkness until 32 weeks gestational age to promote sleep. Benefits from cycled lighting start to be seen between 32 and 34 weeks of gestation with light levels between 10 and 600 lux. Delaying initiation until 36 weeks has not been shown to be beneficial. Implications for research: Future research should focus on stratifying infants based on gestational age at the time of initiation and consider the length of exposure time to cycled lighting while using larger sample sizes.",

H-HOPE (Hospital to Home: Optimizing the Preterm Infant’s Environment) is an early behavioral intervention that provides an innovative developmental approach and contributes to parents’ opportunity to provide care for their infant in the NICU. Purpose: To explore parents’ experience with H-HOPE. Methods: This qualitative study consists of one-on-one interviews with parents as part of a larger study investigating H-HOPE’s implementation and effectiveness. Data from 38 parents encompassing 54 interviews are included in this analysis. Results: Parents report experiencing many benefits from participating in H-HOPE, including an increase in confidence, understanding of infant cues, promotion of bonding, infant benefits, and improvement in relationships with staff. Facilitators to participation include teaching and support in the NICU, being able to be present regularly, family support, and positive infant responses. Barriers to participating in the NICU were infant condition and readiness, family and economic limitations, lack of parent training or readiness, and nurse availability and communication. A lack of time and infant readiness were barriers at home. Implications for Practice and Research: Our findings highlight the importance of early behavioral interventions like H-HOPE that support parent-partnered care, which promotes parents’ participation in their infants’ care. NICU nurses play a critical role in facilitating parent participation and confidence. Future research should examine policies and programs to help enhance NICU nurses’ readiness and ability to engage with and support parents.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Physiologic and behavioral responses to procedural pain are influenced by gestational age (GA). Compared with term neonates, hospitalized preterm neonates are subjected to more painful procedures aimed at improving their clinical outcome. Although several trials to determine the efficacy of sucrose for managing procedural pain have been conducted, none have examined the influence of GA. OBJECTIVES To examine the influence of GA on the efficacy and short-term safety of oral sucrose for relieving procedural pain associated with heel lances. To explore GA differences in behavioral and physiologic indicators of pain. METHODS As part of a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the efficacy and safety of sucrose during heel lance, 190 neonates were stratified by GA: (a) 27 to 31 6/7 weeks (group 1; n = 63), (b) 32 to 35 6/7 weeks (group 2; n = 63), and (c) >36 weeks (group 3; n = 64). They were then randomized to receive (a) oral sucrose and non-nutritive sucking (NNS), (b) sucrose alone, or (c) sterile water and NNS (control) for a heel lance. The influence of GA was determined by examining the short-term safety, as defined by the number of associated adverse events (choking, coughing or vomiting, sustained tachycardia, sustained tachypnea or dyspnea, or sustained oxygen desaturation). The efficacy was measured by changes in a validated pain measure, scored during each phase of the intervention and analyzed according to GA groups. RESULTS Significant differences in pain response existed in each GA group, with the lowest mean pain scores in the sucrose and NNS group. Significant GA differences in behavioral and physiologic responses were found, with the most mature neonates demonstrating the greatest magnitude of pain response. The greatest number of short-term adverse effects to treatment occurred in the lowest GA group. CONCLUSIONS In a secondary analysis of a larger RCT, sucrose and NNS was the most efficacious intervention for single heel lances in each of 3 GA groups. However, infants of lower GA experienced more adverse events. Research on the efficacy and safety of repeated doses of oral sucrose, tested in infants from a wide range of GA, is required.",

    "abstract": "In neonates tracheostomies are most often indicated to provide a stable airway for infants with congenital or acquired airway obstructions and to provide long-term mechanical ventilation. Learning to care for an infant with a tracheostomy can be challenging for both professionals and families. This article provides an overview of tracheostomy care and the essential elements of family teaching. The surgical procedure and basic anatomical changes are reviewed. Complications such as accidental decannulation, mucus plugging, infection, bleeding, and granulation tissue formation are discussed. Humidification is critical for the infant with a tracheostomy and humidification delivery methods are discussed. Further, an overview of the impact of the tracheostomy on normal development, such as swallowing and language development, is provided. Teaching parents to safely care for the infant with a tracheostomy at home requires careful planning and systematic education. The parents must acquire a unique set of technical skills demonstrating competence and comfort in providing stoma care, suctioning, and tube changes. Parents must be prepared to initiate cariopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and need to understand alterations in CPR techniques in infants with a tracheostomy. They also need to develop critical thinking skills to handle emergency situations. A safe transition to the home can be accomplished by using a multidisciplinary approach to coordinate all facets of care.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE This study examined child health worry among mothers of medically fragile infants with differing health problems and identified factors associated with maternal worry. SUBJECTS Medically fragile infants were term (38%) and preterm (62%) infants who had a life-threatening health problem that necessitated a long hospitalization and dependence on technology for survival. The 78 mothers were recruited during their infants' hospitalization. Their mean age was 26 years. Most had a high school education, were married, and were from diverse ethnic/racial backgrounds. DESIGN Descriptive correlational design using data from a larger longitudinal study. METHODS Mothers completed questionnaires while the infants were hospitalized. OUTCOME MEASURES Instruments measured worry about the child's health (Child Health Worry Scale), maternal characteristics (demographic questionnaire), satisfaction with family (Family APGAR scale), illness-related stress (Parental Stressor Scale: Infant Hospitalization), and illness-related factors (diagnostic category, age/days hospitalized, and technology dependence). RESULTS The highest source of worry was medical problems, followed by worry about whether the child would be normal, when the child could come home, and whether the child would always be sick. There was no significant difference in level of worry among mothers of infants with chronic lung disease, congenital airway anomalies, severe gastrointestinal problems, complex congenital heart disease, neurologic diagnoses, and those grouped as other. Fewer days hospitalized, lower maternal education, and higher stress associated with the child's appearance and behavior were related to higher levels of maternal worry. CONCLUSIONS Mothers of critically ill infants, regardless of the type of diagnosis, worry about aspects of their infant's health. Mothers, especially mothers with a low educational level, need support from nurses to understand and cope with their infant's illness to reduce distress associated with worry.",

This report clearly illustrates the importance of birth trauma in clinical practice for neonatal and perinatal nurses. Estimates suggest that birth trauma occurs in 2% to 7% of all deliveries and is associated with an increase in both mortality and morbidity. Birth trauma to the head may result in minor superficial extracranial injuries, such as caput succedaneum and cephalohematoma, or more serious and potentially life threatening lesions such as subgaleal hemorrhages. The potential for deeper intracranial injury, such as subarachnoid or subdural hemorrhage exists; these may be isolated or associated with skull fractures and/or other extracranial injuries. Injury to the eye, nasal structures, and paralysis of the vocal cords may also result from birth trauma during a difficulty delivery. Part 1 of this 2-part article will focus on birth injuries to the head and face.

    "abstract": "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), a heterogeneous group of inheritable connective tissue disorders, is attributed to mutations in connective tissue genes. These mutations cause defects in collagen. Collagen, a connective tissue protein that acts like glue, gives strength to the body and provides support and elasticity for movement. Thus, the altered gene affects the mechanical properties of skin, joints, ligaments, and blood vessels. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is transmitted through autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or x-linked patterns of inheritance. The life expectancy of an affected infant varies with the type of EDS. This article provides an overview of the 6 major classifications of EDS, their unique clinical presentations, a focused physical assessment guide, considerations for nursing care, and resources for parents. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can be a potentially debilitating syndrome. It requires preventative and protective measures starting at birth to preserve joint function to improve infant outcomes. Caring for patients with EDS requires an understanding of the potential associated complications to help minimize the physical and emotional impact of the syndrome and improve the quality of life for affected individuals.",

This article provides an overview of the complex anatomic, physiological, and developmental mechanisms related to immaturity of both the central nervous system and musculature of the pulmonary system, that contribute to apnea of prematurity. Apnea of prematurity is a diagnosis of exclusion; an array of other conditions and stimuli can also cause apnea, including infections, pulmonary disease, and intracranial pathology. The standard clinical management of apnea, including cutaneous stimulation, methylxanthine therapy, and continuous positive airway pressure or ventilatory support, are discussed as well as newer investigational therapies, such as olfactory stimulation. Emerging evidence on the long-term neurodevelopmental impact of apnea is reviewed. Nursing measures to prevent and manage apnea are reviewed with an emphasis on parent education and preparation for discharge. Apnea resolves in most preterm infants as they approach term corrected gestational age; however, if it does not, options include continued hospitalization or, for infants with stable apnea, discharge with a home apnea monitor.",

Physical findings reflect muscle paralysis from spinal nerve roots. The mechanism of injury includes maternal, obstetric, and infant factors that apply traction on or compression to the anatomically vulnerable brachial plexus. Nerve regeneration can occur if nerve tissue components are preserved. Recovery is affected by multiple factors, including the type and site of injury, intervention timing, and developmental factors.

Photographs and on-line video clips will enhance the description of the brachial plexus injury classifications and illustrate mechanisms of shoulder dystocia and obstetric relief maneuvers. A systematic approach to the physical examination will be explored in Part 2. Serial evaluation of motor function recovery is essential and is accomplished by appropriate referrals and follow-up.

    "abstract": "Prune belly syndrome, a rare congenital anomaly, exists almost exclusively in males and consists of genital and urinary abnormalities with partial or complete absence of abdominal wall musculature. The syndrome, caused by urethral obstruction early in development, is the result of massive bladder distention and urinary ascites, leading to degeneration of the abdominal wall musculature and failure of testicular descent. The impaired elimination of urine from the bladder leads to oligohydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, and Potter's facies. The syndrome has a broad spectrum of affected anatomy with different levels of severity. The exact etiology of prune belly syndrome is unknown, although several embryologic theories attempt to explain the anomaly. With advances in prenatal screening techniques, the diagnosis and possible treatment of prune belly syndrome can occur before birth, although controversy exists on the proper management of prune belly syndrome. This article explores the theories behind the pathophysiology and embryology of prune belly syndrome and its multisystemic effects on the newborn infant. Specific attention is paid to presentation, clinical features, head-to-toe physical assessment, family support, and nursing care of infants with prune belly syndrome.",

Subjects: Convenience sample of neonates between the ages of 32 and 40 weeks' gestation cared for in an isolette or crib. Design: A method-comparison design was used to compare different methods for noninvasive temperature monitoring (infra-red temporal artery; axillary electronic) to core body temperatures (indwelling rectal probe). Main Outcome Measure: Bias and precision of test temperature devices (temporal artery; axillary). Results: Bias and precision for the temporal artery and axillary devices were 0.30 ± 0.44 and 0.28 ± 0.33, respectively. Analysis of variance found significant differences between both temporal and axillary temperatures compared to rectal temperatures (P < .01). Statistical differences were small and did not represent a clinically important difference. No statistical difference was found between temporal artery and axillary temperatures (P = .81). Increases in neonate discomfort after temperature measurement were significantly greater with axillary than increases after temporal artery temperature measurement (P = .03). Conclusions: This study found that body temperature measured with the temporal artery thermometer was similar to temperatures obtained with an axillary thermometer in stable, afebrile neonates. The use of temporal artery thermometry appears to be an acceptable approach for noninvasive temperature measurement in neonates, which causes less discomfort in neonates.",

Insertion length has traditionally been estimated using morphological measures, but studies have indicated that these are frequently inaccurate. This study aimed to evaluate the frequency of correct tube placement and to determine a weight-based formula for estimation of insertion length.A prospective study was performed over a 6-month period in a tertiary NICU. Infants with gastric tubes who required radiography for clinical reasons were included. The infant's weight and the type and length of tube were documented. A radiologist assessed the tube position to be high, borderline, correct, or long.A total of 218 radiographs of infants weighing 397 to 4131 g were included. Correct tube position was achieved on 74% of occasions. By analyzing data for correct tube positions, formulas were derived to predict tube insertion length in centimeters: orogastric = [3 × weight (kg) + 12] and nasogastric = [3 × weight (kg) + 13]. The formulas correctly predicted 60% of misplaced orogastric tubes and 100% of misplaced nasogastric tubes.We propose a novel weight-based formula for estimation of gastric tube insertion length in newborn infants to improve the accuracy of this routine procedure.",

    "abstract": "The benefits of kangaroo care (KC) are well supported by previously published studies, yet KC is offered inconsistently and faces obstacles in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The March of Dimes designed Close to Me to facilitate and increase KC in NICUs. The program incorporates KC education for nurses and parents, as well as awareness and comfort components. The purpose of this study was to assess whether Close to Me increased favorable attitudes toward KC among nurses and parents, and changed nurse and parent behaviors to implement KC earlier, more often and for longer duration.This study took place in 5 NICUs with 48 nurse participants and 101 parent participants. It used a pre-/postprogram implementation design for nurses and a nonequivalent comparison versus intervention group design for parents.Nurses and parents were surveyed on knowledge, attitudes, perceived behavioral control, and behavior. Comparisons were made pre- and postprogram implementation for nurses and between intervention and comparison groups for parents. Nurse focus groups were conducted pre- and postimplementation and analyzed using a constant comparative analysis method. Parents recorded care behaviors and satisfaction in journals, which were analyzed similarly.After the Close to Me intervention, nurses reported more positive attitudes toward KC (P = .04), increased transfer of ventilated babies from incubators to parents (P = .01), and more parents requesting KC. Parents who received Close to Me had greater knowledge about KC (P = .03) compared with those who did not. With the Close to Me intervention, all babies born at less than 28 weeks' gestation had KC by the age of 12 days, whereas without the intervention, some did not have KC until the age of 31 days (P < .05).March of Dimes Close to Me improved knowledge and behavior regarding KC in NICUs. By offering KC education to parents, providing KC awareness and comfort components, and providing information and encouragement on the benefits and feasibility of KC to nurses, hospitals can potentially promote earlier and more frequent use of KC, particularly with infants born less than 28 weeks' gestation.",

    "abstract": "Adverse experiences early in life have the potential to disrupt normal brain development and create stress response channels in preterm infants that are different from those observed in term infants. Animal models show that epigenetic modifications mediate the effects of maternal separation and environmental stress on susceptibility to disease and psychobehavioral problems later in life. Epigenetic research has the potential to lead to the identification of biological markers, gene expression profiles, and profile changes that occur overtime in response to early-life experiences. Combined with knowledge gained through the use of advanced technologies, epigenetic studies have the promise to refine our understanding about how the brain matures and functions from multiple perspectives including the effect of the environment on brain growth and maturation. Such an understanding will pave the way for care practices that will allow the premature brain to develop to its full capacity and will lead to the best possible outcomes. Neonatal epigenetic research is emerging and rapidly advancing. As scientists overcome biological, technical, and cost-related challenges, such research has a great potential in determining key environmental factors that affect the preterm genome, allowing for targeted interventions. The purpose of this article is to explore existing literature related to epigenetic mechanisms that potentially mediate the effects of the environment on preterm infant brain development.",

Demographic and other mother and infant covariates were extracted from medical records. Physiologic stability was measured by the Stability of the Cardiorespiratory System in Preterm Infants (SCRIP) score. Study personnel used daily logs to track frequency and duration of SSC and holding sessions.The intervention and the control groups had similar pre- (mean ± standard deviation, 2.34 ± 0.86 for SSC and 2.94 ± 0.87 for holding) and post-intervention (mean ± standard deviation, 2.55 ± 0.95 for SSC and 2.78 ± 0.90 for holding) overall stress scores. Hours of SSC holding positively correlated with the change in stress scores for the entire scale (r = 0.58; P = .001), and for infant appearance (r = 0.58; P = .001) and parent role alteration (r = 0.48; P = .02) subscales. This relationship remained significant after controlling for the infant's length of stay and SCRIP score.Mothers who provide SSC may experience more stress related to a more facilitated progression in the mother and infant relationship.The relationship between increased stress and the number of hours of SSC holding warrants further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Background: Breast milk is the gold standard of nutrition for preterm infants. Yet, initiation of direct breastfeeding before 32 weeks' postconceptional age (PCA) is not common practice in many neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Our clinical question was, “In preterm infants, when is it safe to initiate breastfeeding in infants <32 weeks PCA receiving enteral feedings?” Search Strategy: A review of the literature was compiled between February 2013 and January 2015 by using the following databases: CINAHL, Cochrane Systematic Review, Scopus, and PubMed. Articles found were written in English and published after 1985. Key words were utilized during searches and references were hand checked. Results: Our review reveled that stable preterm infants maintain their physiological status during exposure to the breast as early as 27 to 28 weeks' PCA. Several studies demonstrated infants during breastfeeding compared with bottle-feeding experienced minimal variation in oxygen saturation and heart rate during feeding. Some infants exposed to the breast before 30 weeks' PCA were exclusively breastfeeding (direct breastfeeding and breast milk) at 32.8 weeks' PCA. Skin-to-skin mother–infant contact is crucial to the successful transition to direct breastfeeding. Implications for Practice and Research: The transition from enteral feedings to direct, exclusive breastfeeding should involve frequent mother–infant skin-to-skin contact requiring support and guidance from the NICU staff. Future research should involve creating standard protocols within NICUs to facilitate breastfeeding transition and exploring barriers that may prevent the preterm infant from achieving direct, exclusive breastfeeding.",

    "abstract": "Background: Human milk has multiple benefits for human health; however, rates of infants receiving human milk at discharge in Canadian neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) are far below recommendations of the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative supported by the Canadian Pediatric Association. Mothers of infants requiring NICU care usually need to express their milk, especially mothers of premature infants, since for some time their infant is unable to feed directly at the breast. Expressing human milk for an extended period can be challenging for mothers. Purpose: To document maternal experiences expressing human milk for their infant in the NICU as a closeness or separation experience, and to discover what factors gave rise to these perceptions. Methods: In this descriptive qualitative cross-sectional study, 15 mothers whose infants were hospitalized in a level III NICU and who were expressing human milk audio recorded their thoughts and feelings with a smartphone application for 48 hours while they were expressing milk. A thematic content analysis was used to analyze data. Findings: Expressing human milk for their hospitalized infant was a difficult experience for all mothers, and most described both closeness and separation feelings while expressing milk. Their feelings fluctuated depending on their coping mechanisms, perceived challenges, as well as their location and environment. Mothers were all pursuing their goal of continued milk expression with various levels of motivation. Implications for Practice: NICUs should adopt a family-centered approach to care whereby mothers' care needs related to milk expression are addressed. Nurses can ask open-ended questions to explore how mothers are coping, and they can assist mothers to find effective coping strategies to minimize the challenges related to milk expression to promote mother–infant closeness. Implications for Research: The impact of environment and location on mothers with hospitalized infants should be explored, as unit designs could be altered to foster closeness.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are increasingly recognized as a public health problem. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the prevalence for ASD is now 1 in 88. The prevalence of ASDs in children has increased over the past 2 decades, nearly doubling the prevalence since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began tracking these numbers. Infants are defined as premature when birth takes place before 37 weeks' gestation (259 days from the first day of the mother's last menstrual period). More than 4 million live births occur in the United States each year. Preterm births account for approximately half a million of those births. The rate of premature birth has increased by more than 20% between 1990 and 2006. Cognitive impairment and atypical brain development are thought to be sequelae of preterm delivery. Low birth weight and preterm birth place these infants at higher risk for disturbances in social interaction, communication, and other psychoaffective disorders in adulthood. Major advances in the field of early autism detection include validated screening tools to facilitate early screening for children with ASD as well as those considered to be at high risk for the disorder. Given the significant maternal and neonatal morbidities that are often coupled with prematurity, understanding the prevalence and risk factors that are implicated in changes in the fetal brain may provide researchers with vital links to autism in this population.",

(2) Assessment of all patients at least twice daily for the presence of skin injuries. Interventions were implemented upon identification of a skin injury. Pressure ulcers of Stage II or more were further assessed by wound/ostomy nurses.A total of 2299 NICU patients were hospitalized and assessed between July 2011 and December 2015. After the initiation of skin rounds, the baseline incidence of pressure ulcers increased from 0.49 per 1000 patient days to 4.6 per 1000 patient days, reflecting an improvement in detection and reporting. The most common skin injuries detected included erythema, skin tears, and ecchymosis; the most common cause of injuries was medical devices.A dedicated skin team can improve the detection and reporting of skin injuries among NICU patients. Determination of the incidence of pressure ulcers in this population is critical to develop targeted interventions.Further research is needed to determine the most effective interventions to prevent and treat skin injuries among hospitalized neonates.",

For example, routine use of maximum sterile barriers was reported by 90.4% of respondents; however, the use of chlorhexidine gluconate for skin disinfection was reported only by 49.4% of respondents. A majority of respondents indicated that trained PICC nurses were largely responsible for routine PICC dressing changes (61.0%). Normal saline was reported as the most frequently used flushing solution (46.3%). The most common PICC-related complications in neonates were catheter migration and occlusion.Variable practices, including the use of chlorhexidine-based solutions for skin disinfection and inconsistent flushing, exist.

Despite known breast milk benefits, outcomes related to exclusive breast milk provision are poor. Identifying factors that promote breast milk provision is critical. Purpose: Breastfeeding practices of mothers of VLBW infants admitted to neonatal intensive care unit were explored to identify factors associated with mode of feeding at discharge. Method: This retrospective study replicates previous work. Subjects were VLBW preterm infants consecutively admitted during a 24-month period. Primary outcomes included receiving any breast milk at discharge. Infant variables included gestational age, postmenstrual age of first direct breastfeeding, and comorbid conditions. Maternal variables included age and ethnicity. Nursing practice variables included first direct-to-breastfeeding, number of times to breast daily, and total direct-to-breastfeeding encounters 24 hours prior to discharge. Results: A total of 96 VLBW infants (28.7 ± 2.8 weeks' gestational age) met inclusion criteria. Of these, 48% received breast milk at discharge. Controlling for significant effect of length of stay, infants receiving first oral feed at breast were more likely discharged home receiving breast milk (adjusted odds ratio = 8.7; 95% confidence interval, 2.9-32.3; P < .0001). There were both an independent effect of first oral feed at breast and an interaction where infants of nonmarried women also benefited from the first oral feed at breast. Implications: Significant associations were found between first oral feeding at breast and infant receiving any breast milk at discharge. Targeting VLBW infants to receive first oral feeding at breast may yield the best outcome even among sickest and smallest infants.",

There is little empiric evidence to guide recommendations for practice in this population.Describe the infant behaviors that disrupt feeding in infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome.A mixed-method approach was used to describe digitally recorded infant feeding behaviors. Qualitative methodology was first used to identify categories of behaviors during the feeding. The categories were used as a coding scheme to identify the temporal sequence, duration, and frequency of behaviors observed during a feeding.The behavior categories that disrupted feeding were identified as fussing, resting, crying, and sleeping/sedated. Infants spent almost twice as much time in fussing as in feeding. The majority of the infants were fussing between 1 and 11 minutes during the feeding, and fussing disrupted feeding in every subject at least once. Feeding behavior occurred only 24% of the time, while fussing and crying occurred 51%. Fussing was the primary transitional behavior from one category to another. Infants who did not complete their feeding had nearly twice the mean number of fussing episodes as those who completed their feeding.Fussing is a transitional state and appears to provide an opportunity to test interventions that help the mothers re-engage their infants in feeding. The frequency of the behavioral transitions provides a measure of irritability that has not been previously described in this population.Additional study is needed to evaluate the impact and contributions of maternal behaviors and external variables on infant behavioral transition.",

The questions were related to the communication and information parents received and their ability to participate in the transport process.Twenty-seven parents completed the questionnaire. Responses to yes/no questions identified areas for improvement for the transport team. These included providing parents the opportunity to view an informational video; ensuring that mothers had the opportunity to provide colostrum or breast milk before transport; and providing an explanation to parents about their role as active participants in their infants' care. Responses to the open-ended questions indicated that approximately 40% of parents felt they had received adequate information about their infants' care during the transport and many parents (40%) cited separation from their infants as very concerning and causing distress. More than one-third (40%) of the parents specifically stated that at least 1 parent should accompany the infant during the transport. One father in this sample had been able to accompany his infant to the tertiary center.The integration of FCC core concepts during an acute neonatal transport is important to parents. The orientation of parents to FCC during the transport process may facilitate communication and help them become active participants in their infants' care.",

Early exposure to lead beginning prenatally and continuing throughout childhood is one of the mechanisms associated with unhealthy and unsafe environments, particularly in industrial countries and urban communities. Lead is a known heavy metal that crosses the placenta and blood-brain barrier depositing in fetal tissues.The purpose of this integrative review was to determine which maternal-fetal dyads were at high risk for elevated umbilical cord lead (Pb) levels and to examine the consequences associated with elevated umbilical cord Pb levels.PubMed was searched to obtain English language publications from 2005 to March 2015 for studies examining the effects of prenatal lead exposure on infant outcomes using key terms \"lead\" combined with \"infant.\" A total of 17 articles were retained for analysis.Infants with elevated umbilical cord blood lead levels were associated with maternal demographic factors and country of origin. Maternal-specific exposure to lead products prior to or during pregnancy was associated with elevated umbilical cord blood lead levels. The consequences of prenatal lead exposure to the infant at birth anthropometrically were mixed. The evidence on neurological consequences of prenatal exposure to lead appears to reflect changes in cognitive impairment; however, it needs further study.The major recommendation is primary prevention of lead exposure across the life span. Implementation of policies that reduce the availability of leaded products to reduce leaded products, especially ones aimed at children and women of childbearing age.Research needs to be focused in 2 directions: (1) prevention of lead exposure during pregnancy and (2) prevention of lead leaching from bones for all women of childbearing age.",

Limited research has focused on infants' symptoms and suffering at end of life (EOL) from multiple perspectives. Purpose: To compare retrospective parent report and electronic medical record (EMR) documentation of symptoms and to examine associations with parent perceptions of infants suffering at EOL. Methods/Search Strategy: Bereaved parents of 40 infants (40 mothers and 27 fathers) retrospectively reported on their perceptions of infant symptoms and suffering during the last week of life. EMRs were also reviewed. Findings/Results: Parents were asked about their observations of 23 symptoms. Within the 27 parental dyads, mothers reported 6.15 symptoms (standard deviation = 3.75), which was not significantly different from fathers' report of 5.67 symptoms (standard deviation = 5.11). Respiratory distress, agitation, and pain were most common according to mothers and EMR, whereas respiratory distress, agitation, and lethargy were most common according to fathers. Few differences were found between mothers, fathers, and EMRs. However, missing data (range: 0%-20%) indicated that some parents had challenges assessing symptoms. Parents reported that the worst symptom was respiratory distress. In addition, parents reported moderate infant suffering, which was correlated with the total number of symptoms. Implications for Practice: Parents demonstrate awareness of their infant's symptoms at EOL, and these observations should be valued as they closely parallel EMR documentation. However, some parents did have difficulty reporting symptoms, highlighting the importance of education. Implications for Research: Future larger sample research should prospectively examine parent perceptions of infant symptom burden, suffering, and associations with other infant and parent outcomes (eg, decision making and grief).",

    "abstract": "Although partnering with parents is important to improving neonatal outcomes, no studies have investigated what parents are taught, remember, or experience when their child is afflicted with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).To characterize parental perceptions of communication and support they were given about NEC.An online survey was developed, reviewed for face validity, and then administered to parents whose child had experienced NEC. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and qualitative data were analyzed using a qualitative descriptive approach.Parents (N = 110) wanted to know the risk factors and warning signs for NEC and wanted to be told as soon as their child was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Information provided before diagnosis was felt to be poor by the majority of families, with only 32% feeling satisfied or very satisfied. No parent wrote that they were \"scared\" by information provided to them about NEC; in fact, parents were dissatisfied when they received \"sugar-coated\" information. Engaged parents were significantly more satisfied than those who were not informed, had their concerns and suggestions dismissed, or who had to advocate for their baby against clinician opposition (eg, activating the chain of command).Areas for quality improvement include better communication and collaboration with parents through early engagement in NEC prevention using modalities beyond verbal instruction.More research is needed on how best to engage parents, especially to engage in prevention, and how doing so affects satisfaction and outcomes.",

DESIGN: This descriptive study measured staff quality of work life and family satisfaction before and at 2 time periods after the relocation of a perinatal centre and the introduction of single-family room care. Differences in work life quality and satisfaction were determined using 2-sample t-tests. RESULT: There were improvements in staff quality of work life and family satisfaction at both time periods following the move. CONCLUSION: Lessons learned may be of value to other units considering such a move. A neonatal intensive care unit designed to contribute to parental and staff well-being is a model to be considered for future neonatal designs.",

Infants have cleft lip (CL), cleft palate (CP), or both (CL/P). Dysfunction in the seal, as with cleft lip, or in the ability to coordinate muscle movement to generate negative pressure, as with cleft palate, leads to feeding issues that may compromise growth and affect bonding.The purpose of this article is to present (1) scientific evidence that supports clinical feeding practices for the infant with CL/P and (2) teaching strategies for staff and parents.Evidence was synthesized using a narrative review of randomized controlled trials, qualitative studies, systematic reviews, professional guidelines, and position statements. Findings were used to present specialized equipment and feeding techniques to support human milk feeding.Special considerations for feeding infants with CL/P include assessing the infant's sucking ability, demonstrating proper breastfeeding positioning, supporting mothers to establish and maintain their milk supply, considering adaptive feeding equipment (ie, specialized bottles and nipples), and education about the benefits of human milk.Support from healthcare professionals, particularly lactation specialists and nursing staff, is critical. Breastfeeding and the use of human milk should be prioritized and supported. Research is needed to explore environmental, genetic, and nutritional causes (eg, folic acid deficiency) of orofacial defects.",

Healthcare providers working in NICUs are likely to provide palliative care at some point in their career.This article examines what neonatal palliative care entails, how parents perceive healthcare providers' actions, what they potentially need at the end of their infant's life, and what bereavement interventions are most supportive for parents.We conducted a search of full-text articles published in English in PubMed and CINAHL using the following key words: \"NICU bereavement care,\" \"end-of-life care,\" \"infant loss,\" and \"palliative care.\"Healthcare providers should consider alleviation of the infant's pain and suffering when discussing whether to provide or continue aggressive medical interventions. The timing of these discussions is important. Parents appear to be most comforted by compassionate, caring healthcare providers who show competence and knowledge in the provision of medical/nursing and palliative care.Healthcare providers working in NICUs require specific training in bereavement/palliative care for infants.

Furthermore, the infant's quality of life must be considered when discussing withholding or withdrawing care.There is a need for further research investigating the specific types of training required by healthcare providers in NICU settings who are providing bereavement/palliative care to neonates, in order to best support the families' needs in these situations.",

Although benefits of FCC have been reported, changes in the maternal experience in the NICU are unknown.The purpose of this study was to compare mothers' experiences in NICUs where FCC is the standard of care and to compare these with the experiences of mothers 2 decades ago.In this qualitative descriptive design, mothers of infants born under 32 weeks postconceptional age were asked to describe their experiences with their infant's birth and hospitalization. Open-ended probing questions clarified maternal responses. Saturation was reached after 14 interviews. Iterative coding and thematic grouping was used for analysis.Common themes that emerged were: (1) visiting; (2) general caregiving; (3) holding; (4) feeding; and (5) maternal ideas for improvement. Findings indicated important improvements in privacy, mother-nurse relationship, ease of visiting, and maternal knowledge and participation in infant caregiving.Mothers suggested improvements such as additional comforts in private rooms, areas in the NICU where they can meet other mothers, and early information on back-transport. Better recognition and response for mothers without adequate social support would provide much needed emotional assistance.Future research addressing benefits of webcams, wireless monitors, back-transport, maternity leave, and accommodations for extended visiting for siblings would address other needs mentioned by mothers.",

    "abstract": "Our current culture defines breastfeeding and the use of human breast milk as the preferred criterion standard for infant nutrition. Medical and health professionals have a responsibility to support breastfeeding in the mother-infant dyad. This includes the recognition of anatomical barriers to breastfeeding such as a tongue-tie, ankyloglossia.The purpose of this article is to enrich and expand the clinical knowledge of health professionals about the physical assessment of ankyloglossia and its impact on breastfeeding. Techniques for assessing anterior and posterior ankyloglossia and interventions across the spectrum are discussed. We also explore maternal emotional experiences of breastfeeding an infant with ankyloglossia.A systematic literature search from MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases was performed. The search results consisted of qualitative and quantitative studies performed involving infants with anykloglossia and breastfeeding experiences. Data and findings from the search results were analyzed and reviewed.Ankyloglossia, commonly referred to as tongue-tied, can result in weight loss, painful breastfeeding, and a cessation of breastfeeding prematurely. Depending on severity, interventions to alleviate breastfeeding difficulties can range from a lactation consultation to surgical intervention. The options for treatment and intervention must be discussed thoroughly with caregivers.Thorough assessment of the breastfeeding dyad is essential to discovering ankyloglossia and its role in breastfeeding difficulties. Intervening appropriately can prevent negative outcomes associated with ankyloglossia and breastfeeding.Future studies should be focused on developing universal tools for grading ankyloglossia and the effects of ankyloglossia on speech development. There is also a gap in the knowledge regarding ankyloglossia in the preterm infant and its impact on developing breast and bottle-feeding technique in the neonatal intensive care unit.",

Implementation of a group, or bundle, of evidence-based practices that improve processes of care has been shown to be cost-effective and to have better outcomes than implementation of individual single practices.The purpose of this article is to describe a safe, effective, and efficient neonatal VAP prevention protocol developed for caregivers in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Improved understanding of VAP causes, effects of care practices, and rationale for interventions can help reduce VAP risk to neonatal patients.In order to improve care practices to affect VAP rates, initial and annual education occurred on improved protocol components after surveying staff practices and auditing documentation compliance.In 2009, a tertiary care level III NICU in the Midwestern United States had 14 VAP cases. Lacking evidence-based VAP prevention practices for neonates, effective adult strategies were modified to meet the complex needs of the ventilated neonate. A protocol was developed over time and resulted in an annual decrease in VAP until rates were zero for 20 consecutive months from October 2012 to May 2014.This article describes a VAP prevention protocol developed to address care practices surrounding hand hygiene, intubation, feeding, suctioning, positioning, oral care, and respiratory equipment in the NICU.Implementation of this VAP prevention protocol in other facilities with appropriate monitoring and tracking would provide broader support for standardization of care. Individual components of this VAP protocol could be studied to strengthen the inclusion of each; however, bundled interventions are often considered stronger when implemented as a whole.",

    "abstract": "Benefits of exclusive human milk diets for preterm and low birth-weight infants are well established. Despite known benefits, supporting mothers in the provision of mother's own milk for high-risk infants is challenging. Lactation support in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is highly variable. Lactations consultants (LCs) are often shared between postpartum units and the NICU, potentially increasing LC workload with less time spent with high-risk mothers. Furthermore, less than half of NICUs in the United States staff an international board-certified lactation consultant. Limited understanding exists regarding impacts of NICU-specific lactation support on breastfeeding outcomes.The purpose of this evidence-based practice brief is to synthesize the literature on the impact of NICU-specific lactation support, LCs who work exclusively in the NICU, and provide guidance about how NICU staffing with LCs solely focused on supporting mothers of high-risk infants impacts breastfeeding outcomes for low birth-weight infants.CINAHL PLUS, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and OVID databases were searched using key words and restricted to English language.During hospitalization, NICUs staffed with dedicated board-certified LCs have increased potential to yield improved breastfeeding rates through hospital discharge, increased proportion of infants who receive mother's own milk, and increased duration of breastfeeding or human milk expression through hospital discharge.Human milk nutrition is related to improved outcomes for high-risk infants. Neonatal intensive care unit-specific lactation support can potentially optimize maternal breastfeeding practices and improve outcomes for high-risk infants.There is a need for further studies pertaining to NICU-specific lactation consultants and influences on breastfeeding outcomes.",

Parents who perceive that their infant suffered may report less satisfaction with care and may be at greater risk for distress after the death. Despite calls to improve EOL care for children, limited research has examined the EOL experiences of families in the NICU.We examined parent perceptions of their infant's EOL experience (eg, symptom burden and suffering) and satisfaction with care in the NICU.Forty-two mothers and 27 fathers (representing 42 infants) participated in a mixed-methods study between 3 months and 5 years after their infant's death (mean = 39.45 months, SD = 17.19). Parents reported on healthcare satisfaction, unmet needs, and infant symptoms and suffering in the final week of life.Parents reported high levels of healthcare satisfaction, with relative strengths in providers' technical skills and inclusion of the family. Greater perceived infant suffering was associated with lower healthcare satisfaction and fewer well-met needs at EOL. Parents' understanding of their infant's condition, emotional support, communication, symptom management, and bereavement care were identified as areas for improvement.Parents value comprehensive, family-centered care in the NICU. Additionally, monitoring and alleviating infant symptoms contribute to greater parental satisfaction with care. Improving staff knowledge about EOL care and developing structured bereavement follow-up programs may enhance healthcare satisfaction and family outcomes.Prospective studies are needed to better understand parental perceptions of EOL care and the influence on later parental adjustment.",

    "abstract": "Background: Retinopathy of prematurity screenings is considered a painful procedure. Yet, preterm infants 30 weeks of gestation or less or weighing 1500 g or less or between 1500 and 2000 g or greater than 30 weeks of gestation with an unstable course are required to have these examinations until their eyes reach maturity. Purpose: A systematic search of the literature was conducted to answer the question “For premature infants undergoing retinal eye examinations, what interventions are the most effective for pain reduction?” Methods/Search Strategy: CINAHL Plus and MEDLINE were searched using the key words: retinopathy of prematurity and pain. The search was limited to the last 10 years and experimental or quasi-experimental studies attempting to reduce pain during eye examinations. Findings/Results: The search criteria yielded 14 studies that addressed interventions to decrease pain during examinations. Three strategies were noted for pain relief including nonpharmacological interventions (n = 9), topical anesthetics (n = 3), and examination techniques (n = 2). The findings indicate that these 3 strategies provided varying results for pain relief but could be beneficial if provided in a consistent protocol. Implications for Practice: Consequently, policies for pain management during retinopathy of prematurity examinations need to be used consistently. It is important for clinicians to consider using a combination of strategies that maximize comfort and provide pain relief. Implications for Research: There remains a need to continue to examine pain-relieving techniques for retinopathy of prematurity examinations. Further investigation is needed to evaluate effective strategies that mitigate pain and the pathways causing pain. In addition, investigating the clinical feasibility of examinations without speculum use may be worthwhile.",

    "abstract": "Parents and their preterm infants (born between 32-37 weeks of gestation) are often overlooked by the healthcare system. And very little attention is given to the relationship parents develop with their infants in the neonatal unit (NNU). Specifically, very few studies focused on fathers and how they establish a relationship with their infants. However, we know that the father-infant relationship is extremely important for their future social development and more.This article presents the results of a qualitative study of the establishment of the father-premature infant relationship in an NNU.The study's theoretical framework was Bell's model of the parent-infant relationship, which encompasses discovery, physical proximity, communication, involvement, and emotional attachment. Ten fathers of premature infants (gestational age: 32-37 weeks) participated in 2 semistructured interviews (1 individual and 1 \"in situ,\" ie, at the infant's bedside) during the first week following the premature birth.The results confirm the emergence of different components of the relationship between fathers and their children from the first days of hospitalization in the NNU. The commitment component is the basis for the development of other components in the relationship with their children. Furthermore, involvement influences the deployment of emotional attachment, discovery, physical proximity, and communication toward premature infants. Similarly, the 5 themes of the model can be seen as forming a dynamic nexus in which each theme influences the others.For neonatal nurses, this model of the early father-child relationship helps the understanding of the deployment of that relationship according to 5 components. Similarly, it provides awareness of the experiences of fathers so that nurses can be better equipped to support and individualize interventions tailored to their specific needs, thus helping them develop and sustain the relationship with their children.This study allows us to better understand fathers' experience regarding the establishment of the relationship to their premature infants born between 32 and 37 weeks of gestation. However, there is little understanding about the early paternal experience and more research on this dyad is necessary in neonatology.",

Besides the complete blood count and blood culture, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, presepsin, IL-6, IL-8, and lactoferrin were measured at the admission and after 72 hours.At the time of the admission, presepsin, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, and IL-8 were significantly higher in the sepsis group.

However, few studies have described predictors of parental presence in the NICU. Purpose: To identify sociodemographic, clinical, environmental, and maternal psychological factors that predict parent presence in the NICU. Methods: Using a prospective cohort design, 66 preterm infants between 32 and 40 weeks' corrected gestational age were recruited at 2 level III NICUs in the United States. Data for length of parental presence were collected for 48 consecutive hours from daily visitation logs and medical records. A general linear model was estimated to identify significant predictors of parental presence. Results: Parental presence varied considerably, with a mean percentage of visitation time of 32.40%. The number of children at home ( P = .003), presence of neurological comorbidity ( P &lt; .001), room type ( P &lt; .001), surgical history ( P &lt; .001), and perceived stressfulness of the NICU ( P = .03) each had large main effects on parental presence, and room type and surgical history ( P = .004) had a large interaction effect on parental presence. These predictors accounted for 65.8% of the variance in parental presence. Implications for Research: Future research aimed at understanding predictors of parent presence is essential for developing interventions and designing NICUs that support parental presence. Implications for Practice: Understanding factors that contribute to parental presence may help healthcare providers identify infants at risk for low parental presence and thus be able to provide greater support to these infants and their families.

Nonpharmacologic treatment and using the Eat, Sleep, Console (ESC) model of care have been shown to decrease lengths of stay (LOSs).To determine whether using the ESC model of care to treat infants with opioid withdrawal resulted in decreased LOSs and number of infants receiving morphine when compared with traditional medication management.Retrospective medical review for all patients admitted for NAS 12 months before and 12 months after implementing the ESC model of care. Data collected from electronic health records included demographic data, maternal history, infant LOS, infants receiving morphine, and birth weight/weight on day of life (DOL) 5. Univariate analysis was used to control for demographic data/risk factors. A 2-samples t test was used to compare average LOSs. Chi-square test was used to detect differences in the number of infants receiving morphine. Data were analyzed using SAS 9.4 software.LOS decreased from mean of 17.7 days to a mean of 5.9 days (P < .0001). The number of infants receiving morphine decreased from 20 (58.9%) to 1 (2.7%) (P < .0001). No statistically significant difference was noted in the percentage of weight loss on DOL 5. Data showed an increase in breastfeeding rates from 41.18% to 64.86% (P = .0456).The ESC model of care decreased infant LOS and the number of morphine doses administered for opioid withdrawal symptoms. Maternal breastfeeding rates increased.More research is needed to determine long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of infants managed using ESC principles.",

NEC is now understood to be several disease processes under one umbrella. The most common form occurs in premature infants and can exert significant impacts to preterm morbidity and mortality. Purpose: This narrative review describes current knowledge of the clinical presentation and pathophysiology of NEC in premature infants. Methods/Search Strategy: A review of literature was conducted using key words in PubMed and CINAHL with preference for years 2015 to 2020. Findings/Results: Several converging and interrelated factors including characteristics of the premature intestinal mucosa, gut ischemia, dysregulation of the microbiome, enteral feeding, and genetics create an environment where NEC is more likely to occur. Implications for Practice: To recognize and diagnose NEC in preterm infants, an understanding of underlying factors that create an optimal environment for disease acquisition in premature infants is essential. Implications for Research: Prevention of NEC remains the most important strategy for decreasing morbidity and mortality. Multiple areas of potential study exist for NEC pathophysiology including those that consider how the factors discussed in this review are interrelated and how each particular pathway can be optimized to prevent the onset of NEC.",

    "abstract": "Background: Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) nurses need a better understanding of fathers' needs and perceptions in order to provide more family holistic care. Previous research aimed at exploring fathers' experiences in the NICU resulted in identifying some needs; however, these studies mostly occurred outside the United States where practices may differ. Therefore, research is needed to explore NICU fathers' needs within the United States. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore the needs of fathers who previously had a premature infant in the NICU. Methods: This qualitative descriptive study used semistructured interviews collected to obtain in-depth knowl-edge of fathers' needs in the NICU. Twenty-eight fathers were recruited through 3 parent support organizations: Hand to Hold, NICU Parent Support Network, and March of Dimes. Results: Results revealed 3 themes: need for support, clarity and to be recognized. Implications for Practice: Fathers have specific needs in the NICU that need to be addressed and that may differ from mothers. Awareness of addressing fathers' needs promotes more holistic care to fathers, supports coping within the NICU environment and the multifaceted impact of the experience, and helps them engage in the care of their infant. Implications for Research: Further research is needed to explore the needs of fathers from diverse backgrounds and those who perceive to be or are less involved in their infant's care as well as their experiences and needs related to the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Comparative research is also needed to identify differences between mothers' and fathers' needs in order to determine interventions that promoting more holistic, family-centered care.",

Purpose: This systematic review examines the psychological and medical literature for psychospiritual interventions designed to support parents’ mental health and psychological well-being during or after the NICU experience. Data Sources: Data sources include PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) with peer-reviewed studies published between 2013 and 2023. Study Selection: Peer-reviewed studies that included spiritual and psychological intervention components focused on supporting parents during or after the NICU were included for this systematic review. There were 42 records located in 3 databases ultimately yielding 4 peer-reviewed studies that met inclusion criteria. Articles must have been written in English and evaluate parents’/caregivers’ mental health/psychological well-being in relation to a psychospiritual intervention. Data Extraction: Because of the small number of studies, article summaries are provided within the results section and were written by the first author with approval by the second and third authors. Results: Results indicated that when psychological (focus on coping) and spiritual components were included psychological and well-being outcomes were better for NICU parents. Implications for Practice and Research: The inclusion of psychological and spiritual aspects of coping and supportive care is necessary for the best family-centered NICU care. More work needs to be done to develop psychospiritual supports and include fathers in these endeavors as most work occurs with mothers. Nurses need support and training to facilitate family-centered care with a focus on parents’ psychospiritual needs.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE To determine whether developmental care interventions reduce neurodevelopmental delay, poor weight gain, length of hospital stay, length of mecharical ventilation, physiologic stress, and other clinically relevant adverse outcomes in preterm infants. SUBJECTS Infants born at less than 37 weeks postconceptional age. This review consisted of 31 studies in 4 categories of developmental care interventions, 19 subgroups, and multiple clinical outcomes. The total sample sizes in the individual studies ranged from 16 to 259; the sample size in 18 of the studies was less than 50. DESIGN AND METHODS A systematic review, based on the Cochrane Collaboration format, of all randomized trials in which elements of developmental care are compared with routine nursery care and that measured clinically relevant outcomes. Searches were made of MEDLINE from 1966 to July 2000. Additional databases were also searched electronically. Reference lists and bibliographles of relevant articles were hand-searched. Experts in the field were contacted. If more than one study in an outcome category existed, a meta-analysis was conducted. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES Outcome measures included the following length of hospital stay, weight at discharge, neurodevelopment, physiologic parameters, feeding, growth, sleep/wake states, age at discharge, neonatal outcomes, cost of hospital stay, and death. PRINCIPAL RESULTS Developmental care interventions showed some benefit to preterm infants with respect to improved short-term growth outcomes, decreased respiratory support, decreased incidence of moderate to severe chronic lung disease, decreased length and cost of hospital stay, and improved neurodevelopmental outcomes to 24 months corrected age. These findings were based on 2 or 3 small trials for each outcome. Although a number of other benefits were shown, those results were from single studies with small sample sizes. The lack of blinding of the assessors of the outcome variables was a significant methodological flaw in half of the studies. The costs of the interventions and personnel were not considered in any of the studies. CONCLUSIONS In most studies, the inclusion of multiple interventions made the determination of the effect of any single intervention difficult. Although there is evidence of some benefit of developmental care interventions overall and no major harmful effects reported, there were a large number of outcomes for which no or conflicting effects were shown. The single trials that did show a significant effect of an intervention on a major clinical outcome were based on small sample sizes, and the findings often were not supported in other small trials. Before a clear direction for practice can be supported, evidence showing more consistent effects of developmental care interventions on important short- and long-term clinical outcomes is needed. The economic impact of the implementation and maintenance of developmental care practices should be considered by individual institutions.",

SUBJECTS Twenty-nine mothers and their preterm infants were included in the analysis. DESIGN AND METHODS The study was conducted using a descriptive and exploratory single group design. The analysis included 29 mothers of preterm infants, mean gestational age 33.14 weeks, mean postnatal age 78.59 days, 6 to 10 weeks after discharge. Mothers were administered the Parenting Stress Index (PSI), a 101-item questionnaire that includes a total score and Parent and Child Domains. It also includes the following 13 scales: Adaptability, Acceptability, Demandingness, Mood, Distractibility/Hyperactivity, Reinforces Parent, Depression, Attachment, Restriction of Role, Sense of Competence, Social Isolation, Relationship with Spouse, and Parent Health. PRINCIPAL RESULTS A high rate of missing items was noted on the PSI. In particular, missing items occurred predominantly in the Child Domain. By following guidelines for scoring the PSI when items are missing, summary scores were calculated for 16 of the 29 participants. Total scores demonstrate the stress experienced by parents of preterm infants. Parent Domain scores were comparable with normative samples; however, Child Domain scores were above the 50th percentile for all child scales. CONCLUSIONS Mothers of preterm infants experience stress that is largely attributable to the particular characteristics of low gestation infants. The PSI may provide insight into parenting stress; however, future research should examine missing items more closely.",

SUBJECTS VLBW infants (n = 148) who were fed mother's milk or formula by parental choice. DESIGN Prospective cohort with longitudinal follow-up at 6 and 12 months corrected age. METHODS Self-administered questionnaires given to mothers at study entry, before discharge, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up visits. During hospitalization, mothers recorded the 24-hour volume of expressed milk once per week. At each follow-up visit, the volume of a single feeding was assessed by pre- and postbreastfeeding test weights of infants measured on an electronic scale accurate to 1.0 g. The amount of breastfeeding was also assessed by feeding records and mother's report. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The Bayley Scales of Infant Development (2nd Edition), the Mental Development Index (MDI), and the Psychomotor Development Index (PDI). PRINCIPAL RESULTS After controlling for specific sociodemographic and infant variables, this study of VLBW infants showed no statistically significant effect of predominantly breastfeeding compared with predominantly formula feeding on neurodevelopmental outcomes to 12 months corrected age. The most significant predictor of MDI scores at 6 and 12 months corrected age was birth weight, in which higher birth weights predicted higher MDI scores. CONCLUSIONS Despite the lack of statistically significant differences, the findings suggest a small but consistent advantage in developmental scores in infants who were fed their mother's milk compared with those who were predominantly formula fed. Supporting parents to breastfeed preterm infants may maximize the potential advantages of early nutrition in the neurodevelopmental outcome of VLBW infants.",

    "abstract": "Intralipid infusions remain a critical part of ensuring adequate nutritional supplement and growth in premature and term infants. Managing intralipid therapy requires great care to prevent metabolic and physiological side effects. The authors sought to systematically study medication errors associated with intralipid administration in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). A descriptive quantitative and qualitative analysis incorporating secondary data was used. Medication error data were drawn from 54 institutions that voluntarily participated with MEDMARX, a national, Internet-accessible medication error reporting program owned and operated by the United States Pharmacopeia. These errors were associated with NICUs, and each medication error record identified nursing staff as making the initial error. A total of 257 errors were reviewed, with 3.9% resulting in harm. The mean age of the neonate was 7 days, and more errors occurred on Mondays than any other day of the week. Errors disproportionately occurred between 6 pm and midnight, with a significant difference between errors near 7 am and 7 pm (P = .002). Wrong dose errors occurred in 69% of the sample. Nearly one quarter of the errors resulted from misprogramming infusion devices (either pumps or syringes). Qualitative findings revealed that many of the errors were the result of the nurse's misinterpretation of the modes (ie, time, volume, or rate) on the infusion device or by not recognizing the decimal point on the device's display panel. Several errors involved switching the rate of infusion with total parenteral nutrition and that of intralipids. Voluntary medication error reporting offers valuable insights into intralipid errors occurring in NICUs. Secondary analysis is an ethical, economic means of studying the occurrence of such errors. MEDMARX data suggest that some of the serious errors are the result of complex care and equipment needed for these vulnerable infants.",

SUBJECTS Quantitative data were collected from 3 urban, mid-Atlantic level IIIB and level IIIC NICUs. Qualitative data were collected via interview from 2 RNs employed in each of the study NICUs. DESIGN This was an exploratory descriptive study utilizing a mixed-methods approach. A quantitative method was used for sound-level data collection, and a qualitative method was utilized during interviews with nurses to examine perceptions of factors contributing to noise. METHODS Ambient sound levels, measured in decibels, were taken at 5-minute intervals over a 2-hour period during both day and night shifts in a central location at each NICU. In addition, nurses were interviewed using a standardized interview questionnaire, and these interviews were then reviewed to determine themes regarding perceived factors contributing to sound levels. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Hourly mean sound levels in each NICU ranged from 53.9 dB to 60.6 dB, with no statistically significant difference between noise levels recorded on day shift versus night shift, and no statistically significant difference among sites. Qualitative data showed that nurses' believed day shift to be louder than night shift and many perceived their own NICU as \"pretty quiet.\" Key contributing factors to increased sound levels were stated as monitors or alarms, performing invasive procedures, presence of family, nurses or doctors giving report or rounds, and ringing phones. PRINCIPAL RESULTS Noise levels were found to be above the American Academy of Pediatrics–recommended 45-dB level and often louder than the 50-dB level, which should not be exceeded more than 10% of the time. The recommended impulse maximum of 65 dB was also exceeded. Environmental Protection Agency recommendations for hospitals include sound levels no louder than 35 dB on night shift; this standard was also violated. CONCLUSIONS Elevated sound levels need to be addressed in individual NICUs around the country. Further exploratory studies, as well as research regarding effective methods of decreasing sound levels in the NICU environment, are necessary. NICUs can implement behavioral and structural changes that can decrease the sound levels in the NICU environment and decrease the potential for exposure of patients to the harmful physiological effects of increased sound levels.",

SUBJECTS Convenience sample of 115 infants weighing less than 1500 g who were born at Women & Infants' Hospital, Providence, Rhode Island, and admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. DESIGN A quality assurance study using a nonrandomized experimental design. Infants placed on the TransWarmer Infant Transport Mattress were compared with those treated with standard care. METHODS Charts were reviewed and data abstracted on the 115 very low birth-weight infants delivered at Women & Infants' Hospital, Providence, Rhode Island. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Hypothermia was significantly lower in the mattress group than for controls (52.5% vs 77.3% using a definition of hypothermia as body temperature less than 97.4°F, P = .01). The difference resulted despite the fact that the mattress group was at increased risk based on various risk factors, lower mean age (26 vs 28.5 wk, P = .001), a lower birth weight (876 vs 1091 g, P = .004), and a higher proportion of Apgar scores of less than 5 at 5 minutes (13.2% vs 6.4%, P = .29) compared with controls. A linear regression model adjusted for birth weight, gender, and gestational age showed that the use of the heated gel mattress raised body temperatures by a mean of 0.7°F per infant (P < .001). PRINCIPAL RESULTS The occurrence of hypothermia was significantly lower in the mattress group. CONCLUSION The results of this investigation suggest that further research of the TransWarmer Transport Mattress is warranted using an adequately powered randomized controlled trial. Information on the safety and cost-effectiveness is needed. Long-term follow-up evaluating admission temperatures and long-term outcomes is also warranted.",

Early detection and timely treatment have been shown to be effective in improving visual outcomes; moreover, it is crucial that a series of indirect ophthalmic examinations be performed until an infant is considered no longer at risk for the disease. The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize and evaluate the published evidence regarding characteristics and effectiveness of pain management interventions during the ROP examination. Implications for practice are discussed and suggestions for further research are made. Despite the general consensus that ROP examination is a painful procedure with considerable amount of discomfort, evidence shows that pain management during the ROP examination is inadequate. Although there are currently clear recommendations and guidelines for performing the ROP examination, there are no standard protocols for pharmacological and nonpharmacological pain management during the ROP examination. This is an area where much work is still needed to address the needs of the infant during this critical examination.",

    "abstract": "Perinatal asphyxia and resulting hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) occur in 1 to 3 per 1000 births in the United States. Induced hypothermia as an intervention for asphyxiated infants offers promising results in reducing neurodevelopmental disabilities in surviving infants. Induced hypothermia and selective head cooling are effective interventions for asphyxiated infants that minimize continued neuronal damage and decrease neurodevelopmental disability at 18 months of age. Identification of affected infants immediately after delivery and transfer to a facility that provides this therapy is necessary to maximize the potential of this intervention. Standardization of hypothermia protocols within neonatal intensive care units is essential for providing hypothermia as a treatment of HIE in infants. This article explores the pathophysiology of HIE, identifying infants at risk for HIE as a result of perinatal asphyxia, the use of hypothermic intervention for compromised infants, and barriers to the implementation of treatment.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Examine changes in oxygen saturation in well neonates at altitudes from 4498 to 8150 feet with serial measurements at 12 to 24 hours of age, 36 to 48 hours, and, if still hospitalized, at 60 to 72 hours. SUBJECTS: Convenience sample of well newborn infants meeting inclusion criteria of normal cardiopulmonary status (centrally pink with adequate perfusion) and no respiratory distress (absence of grunting, retracting, nasal flaring, or tachypnea-respiration ≤60/minute). DESIGN: Nonexperimental, longitudinal, descriptive study. METHODS: Using Masimo Radical SET monitors the SpO2 values were recorded from infant's right upper extremity to obtain a preductal measurement and then from left lower extremity for postductal measurement at study intervals. OUTCOME MEASURE: SpO2 values. RESULTS: The well neonates' birth weights ranged from 1835 to 2805 g, with 94.3% classified as term and 5.7% classified as preterm. At the data collection intervals based on hours of life, mean SpO2 readings at 4498 feet were 95% to 96.67%, at 6800 feet were 93.91% to 95.36%, at 7851 feet were 91.80% to 94.37%, at 7890 feet were 93.44% to 96.10%, and at 8150 feet were 93.69% to 96.25%. SpO2 readings at sites at or above 6800 feet were significantly lower than those at 4498 feet. No significant differences were noted for sleep state or season. Significant differences were noted in the first and second lower extremity readings between preterm and term neonates, with preterm SpO2 readings higher than term readings. CONCLUSIONS: Mean oxygen saturation levels for well neonates born at higher altitudes are lower than those born at 4498 feet. Neonates born at or above 6800 feet exhibit \"normal\" oxygen saturation levels between 91% to 96% rather than the expected 97% found at sea level. These reference values for varying altitudes can guide clinicians to avoid hypoxemia or hyperoxia. If routine oxygen saturation screening for detection of critical congenital heart defects is implemented, these results will provide clinicians the mean values specific for additional altitudes, thus preventing unnecessary interventions when results are lower than the expected 97%.",

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Effect of peak sound and differences in infant position on cerebral oxygen saturation. RESULTS: Peak sound levels 5 dB above the average ambient sound level did not significantly change cerebral oxygen saturation values. Differences in cerebral oxygenation were significantly less when infants were changed from a supine, head midline position to a right lateral, 15° head elevation compared with a left lateral, 0° elevation position.

But although the respondents were able to identify physiological factors or lethal conditions leading to a transition to purely palliative care, they stated that these factors were not how the goals of care were established. Respondents (96%) stated that parental agreement was the determinant to palliative care transition, and, regardless of neonatal physiological condition, without agreement, curative technological efforts continued. Respondents felt that more education on the palliative care process for both staff and families was necessary to move dignified end-of-life care forward.Parents must be our partners when the burden of care to the infant is greater than the benefit. Suggestions to assist both parents and providers are offered.Although this study is based on end-of-life decision making for newborns, the findings may resonate to nurses who care for dying patients of any age group, with any diagnosis, cared for in any type of medical-surgical or critical care unit.

    "abstract": "Background: Pentalogy of Cantrell is a rare, congenital disorder characterized by lower sternal defects, diaphragmatic defect, pericardial defect, supraumbilical abdominal wall abnormalities, and/or intracardiac defects. The collective defects result from failure of either differentiation or migration of mesenchymal or mesodermal structures during the embryonic phase of development. Mortality of the disease complex is high, and treatment, when appropriate, revolves around surgical correction of the associated defects. Purpose: This article presents a case of pentalogy of Cantrell and examines the literature to report the most current evidence relative to the embryology and pathophysiology. In addition, the methods of pre- and postnatal diagnosis, management, and prognostic indicators are examined. Methods/Search Strategy: Case report was gathered from the medical records and is provided as it occurred. The literature was searched for evidence of best management strategies as well as care implications for families. Findings/Results: A female newborn was delivered at 294/7 weeks' gestation secondary to premature onset of labor. Prenatal ultrasonography identified an abdominal wall defect, diaphragmatic hernia, sternal defect, ventricular septal defect, and open neural tube defect. Examination immediately after delivery confirmed prenatal findings and a diagnosis of pentalogy of Cantrell was assigned. Implications for Practice: Patients with the diagnosis of pentalogy of Cantrell should receive antenatal counseling relative to mortality and morbidity risks. An interprofessional approach in the immediate timeframe after delivery facilitates timely diagnostics and offers families prompt confirmation of antenatal findings. Implications for Research: Future research can focus on further elucidating genetic etiologies of pentalogy of Cantrell.",

Nurses are the principal caregivers in the NICU. The nurse work environment may influence whether parents spend time with their hospitalized infants. Purpose: To examine the relationship between the NICU work environment and parental presence in the NICU using a national data set. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional, observational study of a national sample of 104 NICUs, where 6060 nurses reported on 15,233 infants cared for. Secondary analysis was used to examine associations between the Practice Environment Scale of the Nursing Work Index (PES-NWI) (subscale items and with a composite measure) and the proportion of parents who were present during the nurses' shift. Results: Parents of 60% (SD = 9.7%) of infants were present during the nurses' shift. The PES-NWI composite score and 2 domains—Nurse Participation in Hospital Affairs and Manager Leadership and Support—were significant predictors of parental presence. A 1 SD higher score in the composite or either subscale was associated with 2.5% more parents being present. Implications for Practice: Parental presence in the NICU is significantly associated with better nurse work environments. NICU practices may be enhanced through enhanced leadership and professional opportunities for nurse managers and staff. Implications for Research: Future work may benefit from qualitative work with parents to illuminate their experiences with nursing leaders and nurse-led interventions in the NICU and design and testing of interventions to improve the NICU work environment.",

Questionnaire results showed that 88% of participants felt better prepared to assist in an ECMO initiation after the simulation. All participants (100%) agreed that the modified mannequin and the environment were realistic and that this simulation helps teamwork and communication in future initiations of ECMO. Simulation can be used for the prevention, identification, and reduction of anxiety-related crisis situations that novice providers may infrequently encounter during routine clinical use of mechanical circulatory support.

Neonatal trials have demonstrated that ECMO is an effective treatment of severe respiratory failure, with acceptable cognitive and functional outcomes. Technological advances in ECMO have resulted in improved safety and accessibility, contributing to decreased morbidity and improved survival of increasingly complex patients requiring ECMO support. Purpose: This review aims to describe the innovations in ECMO technology and management in the neonatal population in the last decade. The long-term outcomes of neonatal patients requiring ECMO support will be discussed. Search Strategy: Relevant clinical trials from MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library were identified. The following key words were used: ECMO, infant, neonate, and outcomes. Findings: Challenges still remain in supporting the premature and/or low-birth-weight infant with severe respiratory failure, as well as infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Neonatal ECMO survivors can present with neurodevelopmental and respiratory problems, which become more prominent with time. Implications for Practice: While newer technologies have led to fewer neonates with respiratory failure progressing to ECMO, it remains an important tool to in those who have failed conventional therapies. Given the presence of neurodevelopmental problems in neonatal ECMO survivors, multidisciplinary follow-up targeting motor performance, exercise capacity, behavior, and subtle learning deficits is warranted. Implications for Research: With the overall decreasing use of neonatal ECMO, ECMO centers must find ways to maintain their expertise in the light of lower patient volumes amidst complex patient physiology.",

The secondary aim was to gain an understanding of the NICU nurses' attitudes toward human milk and breastfeeding.Through a prospective descriptive cohort design, the authors of this study created and disseminated a web-based survey (SurveyMonkey) of 21 questions including the Iowa Infant Feeding Attitude Scale (IIFAS) to a Northeastern urban hospital staff of bedside nurses.A total of 140 of the 389 eligible NICU bedside nurses responded to the survey. Between 50.7% and 72.9% of nurses reported to providing lactation-based support and care during the previous shift worked and during the previous week worked, respectively.

    "abstract": "Feeding difficulties are common in infancy. There are currently no valid and reliable parent-report measures to assess bottle-feeding in infants younger than 7 months. The Neonatal Eating Assessment Tool (NeoEAT)-Bottle-feeding has been developed and content validated.To determine the factor structure and psychometric properties of the NeoEAT-Bottle-feeding.Parents of bottle-feeding infants younger than 7 months were invited to participate. Exploratory factor analysis was used to determine factor structure. Internal consistency reliability was tested using Cronbach α. Test-retest reliability was tested between scores on the NeoEAT-Bottle-feeding completed 2 weeks apart. Construct validity was tested using correlations between the NeoEAT-Bottle-feeding, the Infant Gastroesophageal Reflux Questionnaire-Revised (I-GERQ-R), and the Infant Gastrointestinal Symptoms Questionnaire (IGSQ). Known-groups validation was tested by comparing scores between healthy infants and infants with feeding problems.A total of 441 parents participated. Exploratory factor analysis revealed a 64-item scale with 5 factors. Internal consistency reliability (α= .92) and test-retest reliability (r = 0.90; P < .001) were both excellent. The NeoEAT-Bottle-feeding had construct validity with the I-GERQ-R (r = 0.74; P < .001) and IGSQ (r = 0.64; P < .001). Healthy infants scored lower on the NeoEAT-Bottle-feeding than infants with feeding problems (P < .001), supporting known-groups validity.The NeoEAT-Bottle-feeding is an available assessment tool for clinical practice.The NeoEAT-Bottle-feeding is a valid and reliable measure that can now be used in feeding research.Video Abstract Available at https://journals.lww.com/advancesinneonatalcare/Pages/videogallery.aspx.",

    "abstract": "Achievement of independent oral feeding is a major determinant of discharge and contributes to long lengths of stay. Accumulating evidence suggests that there is great variation between and within newborn intensive care units in the initiation and advancement of oral feeding. The Infant-Driven Feeding (IDF) method is composed of 3 behavioral assessments including feeding readiness, quality of feeding, and caregiver support. Each assessment includes 5 categories and is intended as a method of communication among caregivers regarding the infant's readiness and progression toward independent oral feeding.To identify and summarize the available evidence on the use of the IDF method at initiation of oral feeds, time to independent oral feedings, and length of stay in the newborn intensive care unit or level II nursery for preterm infants.Four databases including CINAHL, Medline/PubMed, Ovid Nursing, and Embase were searched for \"infant guided feedings,\" \"infant driven feeding,\" \"cue-based feeding,\" and \"co regulated feeding.\" The full text of 32 articles was reviewed to identify experimental, quasiexperimental, or retrospective design to assess the evidence related to cue-based feeding.There were no randomized control, quasi-experimental, or retrospective studies utilizing the IDF method. There were 3 quality improvement projects utilizing the IDF method. The findings were conflicting: 1 project found the IDF method favorable in the achievement of full oral feedings, 2 projects found the IDF method favorable for reducing length of stay, and 1 project did not find differences in initiation, achievement of oral feedings, or length of stay.There is scant evidence limited to quality improvement projects to support the use of the IDF method.Research is needed to empirically validate the IDF method and to inform practice related to the initiation and advancement of oral feeding for preterm infants.",

    "abstract": "Background: Utilization of the neonatal sepsis calculator published by Kaiser Permanente is rapidly increasing. This freely available online tool can be used in assessment of early-onset sepsis (EOS) in newborns 34 weeks' gestation or more based on maternal risk factors and neonatal examination. However, many hospitals lack standard guidelines for its use, leading to provider discomfort with practice change. Purpose: The goal of this project was to study the antibiotic use rate for EOS at a level III neonatal intensive care unit and create standardized guidelines and staff education for using the sepsis calculator. Our ultimate goal was to decrease antibiotic use for EOS in newborns 34 weeks' gestation or more. Methods: A standard quality improvement Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) model was utilized with a plan to study the problem, implement the intervention, and test again for improvement. The primary outcome of interest was a decrease in the use of antibiotics for EOS in neonates 34 weeks' gestation or more. Results: Over a 4-month period, prior to sepsis calculator implementation, antibiotic use for suspected EOS was 11% and blood culture was done on 14.8% of live births. After implementation of the sepsis calculator and completion of the PDSA cycle, sepsis calculator use was greater than 95%, antibiotic use dropped significantly to 5% ( P = .00069), and blood culture use dropped to 7.6% ( P = .00046). Implications for Practice: Staff education and systematic intervention using a PDSA model can significantly impact patient care, decreasing the administration of antibiotics to infants at risk for sepsis. Implications for Research: Future research is needed to decrease antibiotic use in premature infants less than 34 weeks' gestation with similar risk factors and clinical features.

    "abstract": "Background: Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the leading viral intrauterine infection in the United States. It causes more developmental delays and long-term sequelae than Down syndrome (trisomy 21), neural tube defects, or fetal alcohol syndrome combined. Yet, this virus, a member of the herpes virus family, is not well known to the public and its prevention is typically not discussed in obstetric offices. Although many infants with congenital CMV are asymptomatic at birth, a significant proportion still may develop sequelae. Symptomatic infants face potentially devastating consequences. Pharmacologic treatment is reserved for those with severe organ or central nervous system involvement. Treatment of infants with congenital CMV can be complex and requires extensive outpatient follow-up. Purpose: To educate nurses and nurse practitioners regarding the risks, signs, treatment, and care related to congenital CMV. Methods/Search Strategies: PubMed was searched to obtain English language publications from 2005 to 2015 for studies examining the current knowledge base of congenital cytomegalovirus, sequelae, and subsequent treatment using key terms \"cytomegalovirus\" combined with \"congenital.\" A total of 18 articles were retained for analysis. Findings/Results: Overall, the greatest risk reduction strategy for CMV transmission is education of pregnant women. In the neonate at risk for congenital CMV, early identification, antiviral treatment, and care coordination are pivotal to maximizing outcomes. Implications for Practice: Increasing understanding of congenital CMV, modes of transmission, signs of infection, and intervention strategies as well as its impact on development are essential to maximizing outcomes. Implications for Research: The need for research exists in the area of valganciclovir's impact on sensorineural hearing loss as well as potential vaccines to protect against CMV transmission. Research is also being conducted in the area of passive immunity via administration of CMV-specific hyperimmune globulin therapy to pregnant women diagnosed with a primary CMV infection.",

    "abstract": "Background: Infants, especially those born prematurely, are at increased risk for skin breakdown because of the immaturity and fragility of their skin. Following a review of existing skin risk assessment tools, we concluded that none provided valid, clear, and concise assessment criteria and direction for treatment interventions specifically for use with neonates. Purpose: To examine the risk factors of skin breakdown in infants using the knowledge of interprofessional providers who routinely care for infants. Combined with scientific knowledge, this could potentially result in a valid, reliable, and useable skin risk assessment tool. Methods: Using an online survey tool, 2 rounds of the Delphi technique were conducted with interprofessional providers who routinely care for infants. During round 1, participants were asked, \"What do you perceive as risk factors for skin breakdown in neonates?\" Responses for round 1 were categorized into themes. In round 2, respondents were asked to rank the importance of these themes using a 5-point Likert scale. Results: These data resulted in the creation of the Seton Infant Skin Risk Assessment Tool, currently being further validated through a retrospective chart review. Responses were categorized into themes, including the use of medical devices, postmenstrual age/birth weight, activity/movement, comorbidities, skin integrity/tolerance, moisture/chemicals, and nutrition/hydration. Implications for Practice: All infants in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) are at risk of skin breakdown. Matching a risk assessment tool with routine skin assessment and a risk-related care plan could result in a reduction of skin breakdown in these infants. Implications for Research: A retrospective study of infants in 2 Level III NICUs and 1 Level IV NICU is being finalized, which will result in an infant skin risk assessment tool as well as a tool describing methods to minimize each risk factor. Further research will be needed to test the interrater reliability and validity of the tool and increase knowledge of skin breakdown prevention practices.",

    "abstract": "Background and Purpose: The American Academy of Pediatrics supports palliative care (PC) for all children with life-threatening illnesses. Thus, many neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) patients and their families could benefit from PC. Our study objective was to examine provision of PC as experienced by mothers and healthcare providers (HCPs) of NICU patients with life-threatening illnesses. Palliative care components explored included communication, choices, comfort, psychosocial and spiritual needs, and coordination of care. Methods: In this qualitative, descriptive study, we conducted semistructured interviews with mothers of infants with life-threatening illnesses and NICU HCPs who cared for these infants. Mothers selected HCPs who were key figures during their infant's NICU stay to participate. Interviews were transcribed and manually coded until themes emerged and theoretical saturation was achieved. Researchers reviewed charts for demographics and notes pertaining to PC. Triangulation of maternal interviews, HCP interviews, and chart notes was performed. Results: Theoretical saturation was achieved after 12 interviews. Mothers identified 5 nurses and 1 physician to be interviewed. Five themes were identified following data analysis and triangulation: (1) communication, (2) privacy, (3) continuity of care and relationship building, (4) maternal knowledge seeking, and (5) emotional turmoil. Implications for Practice and Research: Of domains of pediatric PC explored, participants emphasized transparent communication, family meetings as a venue for collaboration and shared decision making, the significance of psychosocial support for maternal emotional distress, and the importance of continuity of care across an often long and stressful hospitalization. Although mothers desired privacy, participants valued the security of the open-room NICU design. Future research should address components of PC that predominate in this specialized population.",

Medical technology introduces another layer of complexity for parents, including specialized education about neonatal assessment and operation of technology. The transition home presents a challenge for parents and has been linked with greater healthcare utilization.To determine incidence, characteristics, and healthcare utilization outcomes (emergency room visits, rehospitalizations) of technology-dependent neonates and infants following initial discharge from the hospital.This descriptive, correlational study used retrospective medical record review to examine technology-dependent neonates (N = 71) upon discharge home. Study variables included demographic characteristics, hospital length of stay, and type of medical technology used. Analysis of neonates (n = 22) with 1-year postdischarge data was conducted to identify relationships with healthcare utilization. Descriptive and regression analyses were performed.Approximately 40% of the technology-dependent neonates were between 23 and 26 weeks' gestation, with birth weight of less than 1000 g. Technologies used most frequently were supplemental oxygen (66%) and feeding tubes (46.5%). The mean total hospital length of stay for technology-dependent versus nontechnology-dependent neonates was 108.6 and 25.7 days, respectively. Technology-dependent neonates who were female, with a gastrostomy tube, or with longer initial hospital length of stay were at greater risk for rehospitalization.Assessment and support of families, particularly mothers of technology-dependent neonates following initial hospital discharge, are vital.Longitudinal studies to determine factors affecting long-term outcomes of technology-dependent infants are needed.",

We designed an evidence-based golden hour protocol (GHP) with a goal to stabilize and perform admission procedures within 1 hour of birth at a level IIIB neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).The aim of this quality improvement project was to ascertain whether an evidence-based GHP would improve care efficiency and short-term outcomes.Rapid cycles of change using Plan Do Study Act were utilized to document progress and gain knowledge during the quality improvement project. Measures were plotted with statistical process control methods (SPC), which analyzed improvement over time.Both admission temperature and glucose-level means were within reference range throughout the project and predicted a stable process. We observed significantly decreased time to initiation of intravenous fluids and antibiotics. An upward trend of surfactant administration within the first 2 hours of life was also observed.The use of a GHP provided an organized approach to admission procedures and care. By using a checklist and recording intervention times, NICU caregivers were more aware of time management for each intervention and were able to decrease time to initiation of intravenous fluids and antibiotics.Future research should focus on establishing normal blood pressure ranges and safe pain management during the \"golden hour\" and beyond. Future quality improvement should focus on improving subsequent temperature and blood glucose levels after admission umbilical artery and venous catheter placement.",

The Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) used in an urban level IV NICU addresses acute pain but may not adequately measure chronic neonatal pain.The purpose of this quality improvement study was to improve acute and chronic pain measurements for neonates in an NICU through implementation of the Neonatal Pain, Agitation, and Sedation Scale (N-PASS).An evidence search for a comprehensive tool to assess neonatal pain in the setting of a 45-bed level IV NICU was completed. The N-PASS was found to be inclusive of measuring acute and chronic neonatal pain. Participants for a quality improvement study, including NICU nurses and providers, were educated on the N-PASS. Nurses documented in the N-PASS and the NIPS during routine pain assessments for NICU infants for comparison. Participants completed a survey assessing knowledge of the N-PASS.When compared, the N-PASS generated 98% of pain scores greater than the NIPS. Surveys demonstrated an increase in staff knowledge for the N-PASS.Implementation of a multidimensional pain tool that measures acute and chronic pain is essential for proper pain assessment. Providers can manage neonatal pain when accurate documentation is available.Further research evaluating guided management of acute and chronic pain scores on the N-PASS would aid hospital policies on therapies for neonatal pain.",

A code co-occurrence model was used to visualize the relationships between themes.Thirteen mothers of infants with NAS participated. Trying to Do What Is Best emerged as the overarching theme with which several subthemes co-occurred. Subthemes that captured mothers loving their infants and bonding, feeling supported by the infants' fathers, feeling supported in the community, and receiving information from hospital staff were associated with mothers' trying to do what is best. Barriers to trying to do what is best included feeling unsupported in the community, guilt about taking medications or substances during pregnancy, feeling judged, and infant withdrawal.Specific implications for practice may be derived from the mothers' criticisms of NAS assessment tools. Mothers highlighted the value of reassurance and education from providers and the uniquely nonjudgmental support received from peers and male coparents.There is a lack of information about maternal-infant bonding in dyads affected by NAS and factors that contribute to parental loss of custody. Qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods studies in diverse populations might help researchers better understand the long-term outcomes of NAS and develop interventions that decrease family separation.",

Studies that explored nurses' experiences when caring for infants who were dying or when lifesaving care was withdrawn were retrieved and 15 studies were thematically analyzed.Five major themes emerged: advocating for the dying infant, building close relationships with the family, providing an appropriate care environment, nurses' emotional responses to dying or death, and professional inadequacy in EOLC.Nurses face multiple challenges when providing EOLC including moral dilemmas and feelings of professional inadequacy. Avoidance was a common strategy used by nurses to cope with the stress associated with EOLC. Managers can foster quality EOLC by implementing education sessions about infant mortality, EOLC, advocacy, team communication, and self-care practices.Research could evaluate the effectiveness of EOLC education sessions to build nurses' competence and confidence in advocacy and EOLC clinical skills.",

Nonnutritive sucking (NNS) and oral stimulation interventions may be effective for oral feeding promotion, but the mechanisms of the intervention effects need further clarifications. Purpose: We reviewed preterm infant intervention studies with quantitative outcomes of sucking performance to summarize the evidence of the effect of interventions on specific components of sucking. Methods: PubMed, CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PSYCOLIST databases were searched for English language publications through August 2017. Studies were selected if they involved preterm infants, tested experimental interventions to improve sucking or oral feeding skills, and included outcome as an objective measure of sucking performance. Specific Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms were utilized. Results: Nineteen studies were included in this review: 15 randomized, 1 quasi-randomized, and 3 crossover randomized controlled trials. Intervention types were grouped into 6 categories (i) NNS, (ii) NNS with auditory reinforcement, (iii) sensorimotor stimulation, (iv) oral support, (v) combined training, and (vi) nutritive sucking. Efficiency parameters were positively influenced by most types of interventions, though appear to be less affected by trainings based on NNS alone. Implications for Practice: These findings may be useful in the clinical care of infants requiring support to achieve efficient sucking skills through NNS and oral stimulation interventions. Implications for Research: Further studies including quantitative measures of sucking performance outcome measures are needed in order to best understand the needs and provide more tailored interventions to preterm infants.",

Among them, 61% (n = 27) had at least 1 abdominal sign 36 hours before diagnosis, with fewer numbers having 2 (18%; n = 8) or 3 (5%; n = 2). At 36 hours before NEC, abdominal distension, duskiness, higher gastric residual, and greater count of abdominal signs were associated with severe NEC. No medical NEC cases had abdominal signs 36 or 24 hours before diagnosis. Highest severity of NEC was related to more abdominal signs at the times leading up to and at diagnosis of NEC. Gastric residuals were largely unrelated to NEC except for the most severe NEC at 36 hours before diagnosis.Communicating a count of abdominal signs may support earlier recognition and treatment of NEC.More research is needed to explore timing for clinical worsening of status (eg, surgical and NEC leading to death) and to study effective clinical approaches targeting early recognition to support timely action.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Preterm neonates often depend on peripheral intravenous administration of nutrition and medication. Since their skin is not fully developed and very vulnerable, extravasation injury is a risk. Medical-grade honey (MGH) possesses antimicrobial activity and stimulates wound healing; although its use in neonatal patients is limited. Clinical Findings: We present a case series of 7 preterm neonates (28-36 weeks of gestation) with extravasation injuries secondary to peripheral intravenous administration of total parental nutrition and medication. Primary Diagnosis: Extravasation injury following the unintentional leakage of total parenteral nutrition, and medication into the surrounding tissue. Signs of extravasation include local pain, erythema, burning, pruritus, and/or swelling. Interventions: All extravasation injuries were treated with daily cleaning and application of MGH. Some of the cases needed additional surgical intervention or assisted debridement. Outcomes: After treatment, all extravasation injury wounds presented with granulation tissue formation progressed to normal epithelialization and closed in 7 to 67 days (median: 32 days). Upon initial application, peripheral edema and inflammation decreased. When present, necrotic tissue was effectively debrided, slough was removed, and no signs of infection were detected, irrespective of initial wound presentations. Cicatrization was minimal, and the full range of motion was preserved in all cases. Practice Recommendations: Continuous and thorough assessment of peripheral intravenous line placement for malposition, leaking, and signs of extravasation is needed for fast discovery and prevention of further damage. Conclusion: Medical-grade honey possesses antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative activity, enhancing wound healing. Medical-grade honey was safe and effective for treating extravasation-induced injuries, independent of location and severity. We recommend MGH for treating extravasation wounds and consideration for other types of wounds.",

    "abstract": "Background: Numerous scholars have reported that inconsistent levels of incubator humidity in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) require attention. Evidence synthesis was needed to identify optimal incubator humidity levels and duration to decrease transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and the potential for infection. Purpose: The purpose of this systematic review was to appraise and synthesize the evidence of preterm outcomes related to incubator humidity. The primary aim of this study was to determine how patient outcomes were impacted by incubator humidity levels and duration in premature infants born before 32 0 / 7 weeks cared for in the NICU. Methods/Search Strategy: The foundation of this systematic review was the Joanna Briggs Institute method for systematic reviews. Mefford's theory of health promotion for the preterm infant was used to address the wholeness of the preterm infant's body system. Evidence was classified using the Johns Hopkins evidence-based practice levels and quality of evidence. Findings: Twelve studies met inclusion criteria. The evidence demonstrated that the practice of incubator humidity is warranted; however, it does not come without risks. Microbial growth was increased in high levels of incubator humidity. Unnecessary TEWL was prevented by lowering high levels of incubator humidity after the first week of life, improving skin barrier formation. Implications for Practice: Incubator humidity of 60% to 70% in the first week of life was effective in preventing TEWL in infants born 26 weeks or more. Implications for Research: Future incubator humidity research is needed for infants born before 26 weeks.

Standard treatment of newborns exposed to opioids prenatally often requires prolonged hospitalization and separation of the mother-infant dyad. These practices can potentially increase severity of withdrawal symptoms, interrupt breastfeeding, and disturb mother-infant bonding. Use of the Eat, Sleep, Console (ESC) model may ameliorate symptoms, decrease mother-infant separation, and decrease hospital length of stay.To manage opioid exposed infants in a more holistic manner to decrease neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions, reduce the need for pharmacotherapy, and evaluate response and total length of treatment after a unit protocol change from morphine to buprenorphine.Implemented ESC model, optimized nonpharmacologic bundle, and prescribed buprenorphine therapy instead of morphine as needed for adjunctive therapy.Admissions of opioid-exposed infants from the Mother-Baby Unit (MBU) to the NICU decreased by 22%, and the number of infants who required pharmacotherapy was reduced by 50%. The average length of pharmacotherapy fell from 14 to 6.5 days.The successful implementation of the ESC model helped keep the mother-infant dyad together, reduced admissions to the NICU, and lessened the need for pharmacotherapy. The change to buprenorphine further reduced our average length of treatment.Investigation of monotherapy with buprenorphine needs to be evaluated as a valid treatment option. The buprenorphine dosing and weaning chart will need to be revised and modified if indicated.",

While evidence suggests that skin-to-skin contact (SSC) is a stress-reducing intervention for both neonates and parents, the mechanisms that underlie its efficacy are not well understood. Objective: Purpose of this systematic review is to summarize the current state of knowledge on changes in biomarkers (ie, oxytocin [OT], cortisol, hypoxanthine, xanthine, uric acid, and allantoin), associated with SSC in premature infants and parents, that may reflect physiologic responses to stress. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted from 1990 to 2020. Studies were selected using prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: Of the 175 studies identified, only 19 are included in this review. Ten studies evaluated only infants, 2 evaluated only parents, and 7 evaluated for changes in biomarkers in both infants and parents. Cortisol was the most common biomarker evaluated. While changes in infants' cortisol levels were highly variable, in 55% of the parent studies, parent cortisol levels decreased following SSC. In both parents and infants, OT levels decreased following SSC. Only 1 study found that allantoin levels were significantly lower in infants who received SSC. Implications for Practice and Research: While evidence suggests the numerous benefits of SSC, additional research is needed to identify the optimal biomarker to determine the mechanisms that underlie these effects. The use of novel biomarkers (eg, gene expression changes microbiome) may provide new insights into the mechanisms that underlie the efficacy of SSC.

However, since its introduction there have been significant changes in peripartum and neonatal management, our understanding of neonatal physiology, and changes in data analysis capabilities.To assess the Apgar score's reliability and validity in the context of today's clinical and research environments.PubMed was searched using the term \"Apgar.\" Just over 22,000 titles were identified. Full-text articles were obtained if they addressed the Apgar score's use, reliability, and validity, or if the score was a primary outcome measure. This was followed by a hand search using the same criteria. The 505 identified articles build the basis for this discussion of the Apgar score's reliability and validity.Multiple positive and negative aspects of the Apgar score's reliability and validity were identified. Some facets needed to evaluate reliability and validity do not seem to have been addressed in the literature. Overall, the identified concerns can introduce bias into outcomes obtained via the use of the Apgar score in both clinical practice and research.The Apgar score is no longer used to determine neonatal management in the delivery room.The use of the Apgar score in research may introduce bias into outcomes.

Further research is needed to develop strategies useful in mitigating moral distress in and prevent attrition of NICU nurses.Many NICU nurses experiencing high levels of moral distress have left positions or are considering leaving a clinical position.

    "abstract": "Background: Family-centered care is a philosophy and healthcare delivery model adopted by many neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) worldwide, yet practice varies widely. Purpose: The aim of this study was to synthesize recommendations from frontline NICU healthcare professionals regarding family-centered care. Methods: Data were obtained from the baseline phase of a multicenter quasi-experimental study comparing usual family-centered NICU care (baseline) with mobile-enhanced family integrated care (intervention). Members of the NICU clinical care team completed a family-centered care survey and provided free-text comments regarding practice of family-centered care in their NICU and recommendations for improvement. The comments were analyzed using a directed content analysis approach by a research team that included NICU nurses and parents. Results: Of the 382 NICU healthcare providers from 6 NICUs who completed the survey, 68 (18%) provided 89 free-text comments/recommendations about family-centered care. Almost all comments were provided by nurses (91%). Six main themes were identified: language translation; communication between staff and families; staffing and workflow; team culture and leadership; education; and NICU environment. The need for greater resources for staffing, education, and environmental supports was prominent among the comments, as was team culture and staff–parent communications. Implications for Practice: The NICU healthcare professionals identified a range of issues that support or impede delivery of family-centered care and provided actionable recommendations for improvement. Implications for Research: Future research should include economic analyses that will enable determination of the return on investment so that NICUs can better justify the human and capital resources needed to implement high-quality family-centered care.",

Neonatal exposure to donor human Milk (DHM) is a suitable alternative when MOM is insufficient or unavailable. However, the same protective composition and bioactivity in MOM are not present in DHM. Additional evidence is needed to justify and inform evidence-based practices increasing MOM provision while optimizing adequate use of DHM for premature infants. Purpose: A systematic review of the literature was conducted to determine differences in neonatal outcomes among premature infants exposed to predominately MOM versus DHM. Methods/Search Strategy: Databases including PubMed, CINAHL and Cochrane were searched (2020-2021) using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines. Evidence was classified using the John Hopkins evidence-based practice levels and quality of evidence. Results: Eleven studies met inclusion criteria. Studied neonatal outcomes included ( a ) growth parameters (n = 8), ( b ) neonatal morbidities (n = 6), and ( c ) gut microbiome (n = 4). Overall, evidence suggests DHM exposure is beneficial but not equivalent to MOM feeding. Compared with DHM, greater doses of MOM are ideal to enhance protection primarily related to infant growth, as well as gut microbiome diversity and richness. Implications for Practice: Standardized and evidence-based practices are needed to clearly delineate optimal use of DHM without undermining maternal and neonatal staff efforts to support and promote provision of MOM. Implications for Research: Additional evidence from high-quality studies should further examine differences in neonatal outcomes among infants exposed to predominately MOM or DHM in settings using standardized and evidence-based feeding practices.",

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to create an assessment tool to evaluate symptoms of problematic feeding in infants that can be used across all feeding methods (breastfeeding, bottle-feeding, and mixed feeding), then test its psychometric properties and establish reference values. Methods: Item response theory (IRT) was used to identify the most important items on the Neonatal Eating Assessment Tool (NeoEAT) related to symptoms of problematic feeding in infants (N = 1054) to create the Infant Eating Assessment Tool (InfantEAT). Reliability of the InfantEAT was tested using Cronbach's α and interitem correlations. Reference values of the InfantEAT were determined from a sample of healthy, full-term infants (n = 561).

However, no universal screening standards exist and predicting maternal risk remains challenging. Reconceptualizing maternal distress in relation to differences between parenting expectations and NICU experiences may illuminate commonalities across a range of experiences. Purpose: This study explored parenting expectation–experience differences (EEDs) among NICU mothers and assessed correlations between EED scores and psychological outcomes 1 to 5 years post-NICU hospitalization. Methods: A 3-phase explanatory sequential mixed-methods design was used. Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to measure relationships between EED scores and maternal psychological outcomes. Reflexive thematic analysis of one-on-one, semi-structured interviews contextualized EED scores. Results: Most participants (92.9%) reported negative EED scores, indicating NICU experiences fell short of parenting expectations. Significant inverse correlations were found between EED scores and maternal outcomes, including depression ( r = −0.25, P &lt; .01), anxiety ( r = −0.25, P &lt; .01) and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms ( r = −0.41, P &lt; .001), and perceived parenting self-efficacy ( r = −0.28, P &lt; .01). Major qualitative themes included unexpected versus prepared, lost parenting experiences, and surviving and thriving. Data synthesis contextualized EED scores and revealed key differences in meaning ascribed to unmet parenting expectations. Implications for Practice and Research: Preparing mothers for infant NICU hospitalization and creating a NICU parenting environment, which better supports mothers and their engagement in parenting tasks, may help to reduce differences between parenting expectations and NICU experiences. Further research is needed to elucidate the impacts of parenting EEDs in this population.",

    "abstract": "Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is a frequently encountered problem in infancy; it commonly resolves spontaneously by 12 months of age. Caregivers are challenged to discriminate between physiologic GER and the much less common and more serious condition of pathologic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Pathologic GERD may require more extensive clinical evaluation and necessitate treatment. GERD may be primary or secondary; secondary GERD is associated with a number of genetic syndromes, chromosomal abnormalities, birth defects, or a host of neurologic conditions frequently seen in the newborn intensive care unit. This article reviews the unique anatomic, physiologic, developmental, and nutritional vulnerabilities of infants that make them susceptible to GER and GERD. The North American Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition have recently developed a comprehensive evidence-based clinical practice guideline that structures the diagnostic approach and treatment option in infants with suspected and confirmed GERD. These guidelines provide clear definitions of GER and GERD to aid the clinician in distinguishing between the 2 conditions. They emphasize the use of history and physical examination and discuss the indications for the use of other diagnostic procedures, such as upper gastrointestinal studies, nuclear medicine scintiscan, esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy, and esophageal pH probe monitoring. Management of GERD begins with a nonpharmacologic approach; the emphasis is on positioning, a trial of a hypoallergenic formula, and thickening of feedings. When these measures fail to control symptoms, a trial of either histamine2 antagonists or a proton pump inhibitor may be indicated. Finally, surgical treatment may be needed if all other management measures fail. New sleep recommendations for infants with GERD are now consistent with the American Academy of Pediatrics' standard recommendations. Prone sleep positioning is only considered in unusual cases, where the risk of death and complications from GERD outweighs the potential increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The nursing care of infants with GER and GERD, as well as relevant issues for parent education and support, are reviewed and are essential elements in managing this common condition.",

Misconceptions about the infant's ability to feel, remember, and express pain contribute to this long-standing problem. These misconceptions include beliefs that infants are unable to feel pain like adults or to remember it. This article describes the embryology of pain and includes a discussion of emerging evidence that infants do remember pain and consequently react differently to subsequent painful experiences. In addition, the adverse long-term effects of pain on the developing infant are identified and discussed. Permanent structural and function changes in the brain and spinal cord occur with repeated painful experiences, and adverse outcomes are described. An enhanced understanding of the infant's ability to experience pain and the long-term effects of unrelieved pain are essential to avoid harm and to maximize short- and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in this vulnerable population.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE Decisions regarding the need for volume replacement in neonates often are made in the immediate newborn period. Capillary refill time (CRT) is used as an indicator of circulatory status; however, recent data show that CRT varies considerably with age, ambient and skin temperature, anatomical site of measurement, and duration of pressure. The purpose of this study was to (1) examine the relationship between CRT and heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) in term neonates, and (2) evaluate the differences among CRT values measured at 3 body sites and with varying duration of cutaneous pressure. DESIGN This was a prospective, cross-sectional, correlational study. SUBJECTS Forty-two appropriate-weight-for-gestational-age (AGA) neonates with birthweights, (M = 3407; SD = ± 540 g), gestational ages (M = 39 weeks; SD = ± 1 week), and sex (21 males, 21 females). Infants had no history of perinatal distress or maternal chorioamnionitis. METHODS Each neonate was studied prospectively 1 to 4 hours after birth. The infants were clothed with only a diaper and evaluated on a radiant warmer bed set to achieve an axillary temperature of 36.5° to 37.0°C. Capillary refill time was measured with a digital stopwatch at 3 sites: volar surface of finger (F), plantar surface of heel (H), and lower sternum (St), using brief (1- to 2-second) and extended (3- to 4-second) pressure. Heart rate was auscultated and counted for 60 seconds, and BP was measured by oscillometry. Relationships among variables were assessed by Pearson correlation coefficient, analysis of variance, and multiple regression analysis. The Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was applied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Capillary refill time, blood pressure, and heart rate. PRINCIPAL RESULTS There was no significant site variation for CRT for either brief (2.4 ± 0.6 to 2.9 ± 1.0 seconds) or extended (3.8 ± 0.8 to 4.3 ± 0.8 seconds) pressure. However, regardless of site, CRT was greater when extended versus brief pressure was used (P < 0.001). There were no significant correlations between HR and CRT. There was a moderate, direct relationship between BP and CRT observed in the following anatomic sites: (1) sternum/extended pressure and systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP, and mean BP (r = 0.35, P = 0.02; r = 0.49, P = 0.001; and r = 0.43, P = 0.005, respectively); (2) sternum/brief pressure and SBP (r = 0.31, P = 0.05); and (3) finger/extended pressure and SBP (r = 0.30, P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS An unanticipated moderate, direct correlation between BP and CRT was observed; prolongation of CRT occurred with elevated blood pressure. This finding may have been secondary to increased circulating vasoactive substances in the newborn period; measurement of these substances was beyond the scope of this study. In addition, CRT was highly dependent on the duration of cutaneous pressure, regardless of the site. These 2 findings indicate that CRT may be an unreliable indicator of cardiovascular status in the term neonate during the first 4 hours after birth.",

    "abstract": "Forty years ago manufacturers commonly used polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in a wide variety of products. In the late 1970s, following research demonstrating neurotoxicity in animals, even at low levels, PCBs were banned internationally. Today PCBs are widespread environmental contaminants and may be isolated from breast milk of women worldwide. This article provides an overview of the current research on the relationship between PCBs in breast milk and their effects on breastfed children with regard to neurological effects, growth and maturity, potential mitigating effects of breastfeeding, and immunologic effects. The vast majority of results from this body of research indicate that despite higher PCB loads, breastfed children continue to fare better than their formula-fed peers. At this point, there is no evidence of a threshold among the general population beyond which the risks of breastfeeding outweigh the benefits, nor is there any evidence demonstrating a clinically significant negative effect of postnatal exposure to PCBs via breast milk. To date the majority of studies conclude that despite substantially higher PCB loads among breastfed infants, breastfeeding is still preferable to formula feeding.",

The modified Seldinger technique allows insertion of the PICC via smaller peripheral veins while decreasing venous trauma and enhancing the rate of successful placement. A second useful technique, the catheter exchange procedure, allows insertion of a new catheter within the same vein when complications such as occlusion, breakage, or inappropriate position occur and require removal of the currently dwelling PICC.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE The purpose of this pilot study was to determine the cerebral blood flow velocity and resistance changes and vital signs following a painful stimulus in the premature infant. SUBJECTS A convenience sample of 12 infants was randomly assigned to one of 2 treatment groups. In the final analysis, there were 10 infants younger than 24 hours of age and between 25 and 32 weeks' gestational age. DESIGN A randomized 2-period, 2-group, crossover design was used. METHODS Cerebral blood flow velocity and resistance were measured via a Doppler head ultrasound transducer placed over the anterior fontanel. Vital signs were measured with a cardiorespiratory monitor. The infant then received the heel stick procedure or the sham procedure (heel preparation with no heel puncture). Each infant served as his or her own control. After each procedure, there was ultrasound and vital sign measurement at 15, 60, 120, 180, 240, and 300 seconds. Thereafter, the alternate treatment was used and 6 more measurements were taken. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Cerebral values: peak systolic velocity (PSV) and resistive index (RI); vital signs: heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2), and blood pressure. RESULTS Treatment groups were similar at baseline except for gestational age. There were no carryover or period effects in the crossover design for the primary outcomes except for SpO2. There was a significant group effect (heel stick compared with sham) (P = .009) for peak systolic velocity; however, there were no significant differences between groups at each time point. Two subjects had a distinctive pattern based on simultaneous changes in flow and resistance: when flow velocity increased, resistance decreased. This may be reflective of risk for intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was not significant. However, heart rate was significantly different between stick and sham at 15 seconds (P = .022); respiratory rate was significant at 180 seconds (P = .029); and SpO2 was significant at 3 different time points. There were no significant correlations between PSV and mean arterial blood pressure and PSV and SpO2 when comparing stick to sham. CONCLUSIONS This is a study based on a small sample size. However, the Doppler-measured peak systolic velocity increases significantly after a painful stimulus. The clinical implication of this finding needs to be established.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE Determine whether levels of depressive symptoms and current stress related to prior perinatal loss differ from similar prenatal evaluations after the birth of a subsequent healthy full-term infant and investigate differences in depressive symptoms in the postpartum period among parents with and without a history of perinatal loss. PARTICIPANTS Seventy-four of the original 206 parents who participated in an earlier prenatal study agreed to participate at follow-up and were divided into 2 groups (38 parents with a history of perinatal loss and 36 parents with no prior losses). METHODS AND DESIGN A 2-wave, 2-group comparative design was used. Both mothers and fathers were recruited for this study. Surveys were completed via telephone interviews. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, t tests and Pearson correlations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The Impact of the Event Scale (IES) is broadly used to evaluate the continuing influence of a past stressful life event. In the current study, the items were anchored to the traumatic event of perinatal loss. The IES contains 2 subscales: Intrusion and Avoidance. Cronbach's alphas for the current study were .80 (total scale), .85 (Intrusion subscale), and .69 (Avoidance subscale). The Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) is used to identify the duration and frequency of depressive symptoms experienced by the respondent during the previous week. The Cronbach's alpha for the current study was .92. PRINCIPLE RESULTS There was a significant overall decrease in depressive symptoms after the birth of a healthy infant for fathers but not for mothers with prior perinatal losses. Nevertheless, approximately one third of the mothers with a history of loss continued to report CES-D scores that placed them at high risk for depression. There also was a significant decrease in stress related to the prior loss for both mother and fathers. The greater the stress associated with the prior loss, the greater were parents' depressive symptoms after birth. In contrast to the prenatal assessment, there were no significant differences in levels of depressive symptoms between the loss and nonloss groups at the postnatal assessment. CONCLUSIONS The stress associated with perinatal loss, although diminished after the subsequent birth of a healthy infant compared with that during pregnancy, remained high for many parents, especially mothers. Neonatal nurses need to continue to evaluate parents with a history of perinatal loss for ongoing psychological distress after the birth of a subsequent healthy infant.",

Since nasogastric tube placement techniques are not well standardized and common verification methods can be unreliable, placement errors may lead to unsafe situations. In mechanically ventilated neonates and neonates on continuous positive airway pressure, malpositioning of the nasogastric tube may prevent excess air within the stomach to escape. In this study, we aimed to relate tube position to amount of air. The hypothesis was: the better the position of the tube, the smaller the amount of air in the stomach.A 1-year cohort of neonates in a level IIIc neonatal intensive care unit with a nasogastric tube.We retrospectively reviewed 326 radiographs and classified nasogastric tube position and gastric air. Descriptive statistics were used to describe demographic data. Kendal's tau statistic was applied to explore the relationship between nasogastric tube position and amount of gastric air. A Mann-Whitney U test was performed to confirm the differences in gastric air in neonates with Ch5 and Ch6 gastric tubes and neonates with Ch8 gastric tubes.One or both orifices of nasogastric tubes were in the esophagus in 7.1% of cases, tubes were curled up in the stomach in 35.3% of cases, and tube tips were beyond the pyloric sphincter in 5.5% of cases. Substantial or excessive air was found in 37.7% of cases. Kendal's tau value indicated that there was no significant correlation between nasogastric tube position and gastric air. The Mann-Whitney U value indicated that children with Ch5 and Ch6 gastric tubes had significantly more gastric air than children with Ch8 gastric tubes.Nasogastric tubes were malpositioned in nearly half of cases, and substantial or excessive air was found in more than one-third of cases. The hypothesis-the better the position of the tube, the smaller the amount of gastric air-was not confirmed by the data. However, a significant relationship was found between tube size and gastric air.",

Of the participants, 96% worked in a level 3 NICU.A descriptive, correlational design was used to study job satisfaction among NICU nurses.Nurses were recruited at 2 regional NICU conferences in 2009 and 2010. The questionnaire was a researcher-developed survey consisting of 14 questions in a Likert-type response rating 1 to 5, with an area for comments. Descriptive statistics and correlations were used to analyze the resulting data.The majority of participants were moderately satisfied overall in their current position and workplace (mean ranking = 4.07 out of 5.0). Kendall's Tau b (TB) revealed that the strongest positive correlations were between organizational support and team spirit with overall job satisfaction (TB = 0.53).: The individual factors with the highest mean scores were caring for patients in a stressful situation, level of autonomy, and communication between nurses and neonatal nurse practitioners. This indicates that our population of NICU nurses feels most satisfied caring for patients in stressful situations (m = 4.48), are satisfied with their level of autonomy (M = 4.17), and are satisfied with the interdisciplinary communication in their units (m = 4.13).Nurses in the NICU are relatively satisfied with their jobs. The small sample size (n = 109) of Midwest NICU nurses proves to be a limitation for generalization. Additional research is needed to further evaluate nursing role, educational level, and job satisfaction in the NICU.",

In Portugal, physicians are the stakeholders in the decision-making process with reference to the transition to palliative care in the neonatal intensive care unit, and it was considered very important to raise their awareness and motivation about neonatal palliative care. Our research was based on Catlin and Carter's protocol from 2002 and the main goal was to assess neonatologists' willingness to build a palliative care and end-of-life protocol that could be acceptable nationwide. The survey used the Delphi technique and was developed in 3 rounds. The expert panel was composed of 57 participants who represented 41% of the Portuguese neonatologists. The study was conducted via the Internet, based in a researcher-created private Web site, and e-mail was used for data collection and feedback. Neonatologists agreed on 7 areas: (1) planning (medical education, resources, and local), (2) prenatal palliative care, (3) neonatal palliative care criteria, (4) the parents (presenting neonatal palliative care to parents, including then in the daily care of newborns and in family-centered care), (5) physicians' needs, (6) pain and symptom management, and (7) end-of-life care (withholding/withdrawing ventilation and hydration/nutrition).",

Care of a dying infant requires the same skill set as caring for older terminally ill children internationally. A combination of face-to-face lectures and interactive workshops using case studies and audiovisual examples is the preferred format.",

The impact at the state level has been the evolution of a fragmented, perinatal system with limited access and poorer outcomes. The evidence demonstrates lower mortality risk for very low-birth-weight infants born in designated tertiary centers. Regionalized systems of perinatal care are recommended to ensure that each mother and newborn achieve optimal outcomes. This article discusses the factors impacting implementation of this model at either the state or federal level as well as the incorporation of perinatal regionalization as part of the national agenda of health care reform.",

    "abstract": "The ability of a preterm infant to exclusively oral feed is a necessary standard for discharge readiness from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Many of the interventions related to oral feeding advancement currently employed for preterm infants in the NICU are based on individual nursing observations and judgment. Studies involving standardized feeding protocols for oral feeding advancement have been shown to decrease variability in feeding practices, facilitate shortened transition times from gavage to oral feedings, improve bottle feeding performance, and significantly decrease the length of stay (LOS) in the NICU.This project critically evaluated the implementation of an oral feeding advancement protocol in a 74-bed level III NICU in an attempt to standardize the process of advancing oral feedings in medically stable preterm infants.A comprehensive review of the literature identified key features for successful oral feeding in preterm infants.Strong levels of evidence suggested an association between both nonnutritive sucking (NNS) opportunities and standardized feeding advancement protocols with successful oral feeding in preterm infants. These findings prompted a pilot practice change using a feeding advancement protocol and consisted of NNS and standardized oral feeding advancement opportunities. Time to exclusive oral feedings and LOS were compared pre- and postprotocol implementation during more than a 2-month evaluation period.Infants using NNS and the standardized oral feeding advancement protocol had an observed reduction in time to exclusive oral feedings and LOS, although statistical significance was not achieved.",

Subjects: Eleven mothers of very low-birth-weight infants who have received various supplemental oxygen delivery methods in the NICU for a minimum of 7 days were selected for interview. Design: Qualitative descriptive. Methods: One semistructured interview exploring mothers' experiences surrounding oxygen delivery methods was conducted. Qualitative content analysis was undertaken to describe mothers' experience. Principle Results: Four themes emerged related to the oxygen therapy and the various methods of delivery: Oxygen therapy is a positive, worries about the adverse effects for my baby now and in the future, a learning experience, and the delivery of supplemental oxygen is a barrier to mothering. Conclusion: Mothers balanced the positive aspects of oxygen therapy with their fears of the negative consequences. They were able to adapt to the equipment and trajectory of having their infant on supplemental oxygen delivery methods. Mothers were particularly distressed by the physical barriers created by oxygen delivery methods (ie, unable to hold, hear, or see their baby). Nurses in the NICU should support mothers' positive reframing as a way of coping, provide education about the consequences of this therapy, encourage mothers to touch and hold their infants, and provide opportunities for them to see their infants' faces.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Care of the very low-birth-weight (VLBW) infant is associated with prolonged hospitalization and increased hospital costs. Specific complications of prematurity, including necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), late-onset sepsis (LOS), and feeding intolerance, contribute to increased cost and length of hospitalization in this population. The provision of breast milk to VLBW infants has been associated with decreased incidence of NEC and LOS as well as fewer days required to achieve full enteral feedings. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of breast milk on length of hospitalization and hospital costs among VLBW infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). SUBJECTS: A total of 80 infants weighing less than 1500 g, born prior to 32 weeks' gestation and who remained in the home hospital until discharge. DESIGN: This descriptive comparative study examined cost of hospitalization and length of stay between 2 groups of VLBW premature infants fed either exclusively formula (n = 40) or at least 50% breast milk (n = 40) during their hospitalization. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was used to collect information concerning patient demographics, discharge information, and nutritional variables. Information regarding hospital costs was obtained from the hospital's patient accounting office. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Independent t tests were used to compare demographic data, length of hospitalization, and cost of care between the 2 groups. PRINCIPAL RESULTS: No statistically significant differences in length of stay or cost of care were found between infants fed at least 50% breast milk and those who were exclusively formula fed. Descriptive data concerning length of stay and cost of care for VLBW infants and those infants weighing less than 1000 g are presented. CONCLUSION: This article presents a descriptive comparative study on the effect of providing at least 50% breast milk feedings compared with formula feeding on days to discharge and cost of hospitalization in VLBW infants in the NICU. It also provides information concerning cost of care and length of stay in VLBW and infants weighing less than 1000 g.",

The current approach to management of maternal symptoms related to postpartum depression in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) ranges from no intervention to depression screening and referral. For depressed mothers of NICU infants, obtaining treatment is especially difficult and usually becomes a secondary priority; thus, we looked to a nurse-delivered counseling model. Listening visits (LV) are an empirically supported nurse-delivered intervention that focuses on relationship building and exploration of a mother's problems through active reflective listening and collaborative problem solving. An LV open trial in the NICU has been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention for mothers of hospitalized infants. Results indicate that LV are associated with a reduction in both maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms. This case study following the description of the intervention demonstrates how the authors used the experiences from the NICU open trial to expand the application of LV to this new setting.",

Purpose: To compare agreement and consistency of transcutaneous and serum bilirubin measurements in a multiracial premature infant population ranging from 30 to 34 JOURNAL/ancr/04.03/00149525-201804000-00012/12FSM1/v/2023-07-21T043933Z/r/image-gif weeks' gestation before, during, and after phototherapy. Methods: Forty-five neonates, 30 to 34 JOURNAL/ancr/04.03/00149525-201804000-00012/12FSM1/v/2023-07-21T043933Z/r/image-gif weeks' gestation, were enrolled in this prospective, correlational study over a 12-month period. One set of paired transcutaneous and serum bilirubin measurements, per neonate, was obtained before phototherapy, during therapy, and after phototherapy. Exclusion criteria included neonates with positive direct coombs test or evidence of hemolytic disease, major congenital anomalies, hydrops fetalis, and those not expected to survive. Results: There was a strong, positive correlation between TcB and total serum monitoring (TSB) measurements obtained pretherapy ( r = 0.797, P &lt; .001). A moderate correlation was noted between TcB and TSB measurements obtained during therapy ( r = 0.588, P &lt; .001). A strong correlation was noted between TcB and TSB measurements obtained posttherapy ( r = 0.869, P &lt; .001). There were no significant differences between paired samples across time ( F = 0.891, P = .41, partial η 2 = 0.01). The TSB measurements were consistently lower than TcB pretherapy, during, and posttherapy. Implications for Practice: The TcB measurements provide a reliable estimation, generally within 2 to 3 mg/dL of TSB levels, in premature infants 30 to 34 JOURNAL/ancr/04.03/00149525-201804000-00012/12FSM1/v/2023-07-21T043933Z/r/image-gif weeks' gestation. Implications for Research: Investigation of consumption of time and nursing personnel required to perform TcB testing, compared with TSB testing, is indicated. Cost analyses comparing TcB-driven screening protocols and interval TSB measurements, among premature infants, are indicated. As newer generations of TcB devices are approved for use, additional studies using mixed-race populations of premature infants will be necessary to continue to evaluate the reliability and validity of this screening tool within the everyday neonatal intensive care unit.",

    "abstract": "Background: Mother's own milk (MOM) provides significant health benefits to very low birth-weight infants (VLBW, ≤1500 g). However, 60% of African American (AA) women initiate lactation, and less than 35% provide MOM 6 months following the birth of their infant. Previous research focuses on term infants and is not specific to AA mothers of VLBW infants. Purpose: To qualitatively describe supports and barriers experienced by AA mothers while providing MOM for their VLBW infants. Methods: In this qualitative, descriptive study, we conducted semistructured interviews with AA mothers who provided MOM for their VLBW infant. Interviews were transcribed and manually coded concurrently with enrollment until theoretical saturation was achieved. Infant charts were reviewed for demographics, and triangulation with notes from the medical record by bedside nurse lactation consultants and other providers was performed to increase validity. Member checks were completed to ensure true meaning of responses. Results: Theoretical saturation was achieved after 9 interviews. Themes perceived to support provision of MOM included (1) Being a Mother; (2) Neonatal intensive care unit environment; (3) Community support; and (4) Useful resources. Themes that emerged as barriers to the provision of MOM were: (1) Maternal illness; (2) Milk expression; (3) Challenging home environment; and (4) Emotional distress. Implications for Practice: African American mothers report supports similar to published data but faced challenges not previously reported. These factors warrant attention by professionals who support lactation in this population. Implications for Research: Future research will address perceived barriers to improve provision of MOM and the quality of the lactation journey of AA mothers of preterm infants.",

    "abstract": "Although extensive research has been conducted on preterm infant oral feeding, few investigations have examined parents' experiences learning to feed orally their preterm infant while in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). As such, the aim of this study was to explore parental learning experiences to gain a better understanding of the process parents use in learning to feed their preterm infant.Parents included in the investigation were 18 years of age or older with a medically stable preterm infant who was less than 36 weeks' gestational age at birth, free of congenital malformations, and feeding orally.This investigation used phenomenology to explore the depth and richness of parental experience with the process of learning to feed orally their preterm infant.Participants were recruited from a university-affiliated women's hospital with a level III NICU. Purposive sampling was used to ensure that all participants were familiar with the experience of interest. Data collection consisted of personal interviews, which were conducted in a private consultation room located within the NICU. In instances where both the infant's mother and father chose to participate, the interviews were conducted separately on the same day.Twelve mothers and 8 fathers participated in semistructured interviews. For 8 mothers and 6 fathers, this was their first child. This was the first preterm infant for all participants. From the parental experience, the following 3 themes were identified: an emotional experience, learn as you go, and it is technical.Parents noted that feeding encompassed both positive and negative emotions, that learning was a process that nurses played an instrumental role in, and that feeding a preterm infant could be very technical, requiring extra skills for feeding success.Nurses can play a key role in helping parents learn by acknowledging both positive and negative feelings about the feeding process, recognizing parents' learning needs, and by teaching and demonstrating appropriate feeding techniques.",

    "abstract": "Background: While biological and behavioral stress response systems are intact in early gestation, preterm infants' behaviors are often more subtle and difficult to interpret compared with full-term infants. They are also more vulnerable for regulatory issues (ie, colic) that are known to impact caregiver–infant interactions. Biobehavioral measures such as behavioral responsivity and heart rate variability (HRV), particularly cardiac vagal tone, may help elucidate preterm infants' stress/regulatory systems. Purpose: To test the hypotheses that preterm infants' consoling behaviors and high-frequency (HF) HRV in the first week of life are significantly associated and they are inverse correlates of future colic risk. Methods/Search Strategy: Thirty preterm (mean ± SE = 32.7 ± 0.3 weeks postmenstrual age [PMA]) infants underwent direct NIDCAP (Newborn Individualized Development and Assessment Program) observation during routine care and had HRV measurements during their first week postbirth. Sixty-three percent of mothers completed the Infant Colic Scale at 6 to 8 weeks adjusted postnatal age. Nonparametric tests were used to determine associations among behaviors, HRV, and maternal perceptions of infant colic. Findings/Results: Self-consoling behaviors were positively associated with HF-HRV (vagal tone). In addition, stress behaviors were positively associated with low-frequency/high-frequency HRV (sympathetic dominance). Infants who displayed more stress behaviors also demonstrated more self-consoling behaviors. No significant associations were found with colic. Implications for Practice: HF-HRV provides information on the infant's capacity to modulate stress and is a useful, noninvasive measure when behaviors are more difficult to discern. Implications for Research: Further study in a larger sample is needed to determine whether behavioral stress measures and HF-HRV may be useful to determine colic risk.",

The Wetzel/Krisman tool, eNEC, was developed and tested as part of a quality improvement initiative in a single clinical setting using evidence synthesis, review by internal expert clinicians, and implementation and evaluation of its use by direct line neonatal staff. Refinement of both tools is under way to evaluate their effect on clinical decision making, early identification of NEC and surgical NEC. METHODS AND MAIN OUTCOMES: Clinicians can take an active role to reduce NEC in their units by focusing on modifiable risk factors such as adoption of standardized feeding protocols, preferential feeding of human milk, and antibiotic and histamine blocker stewardship. RESULTS: Feeding during transfusion remains controversial, but judicious use of transfusions, adoption of transfusion guidelines, and withholding feeding during transfusion are feasible measures with potential benefit to prevent NEC and confer little risk.",

    "abstract": "Background: Gastric tubes are used in nurseries on a daily basis. Various methods of estimating gastric tube length for insertion using anatomical landmarks are used to assist correct placement. Sometimes, however, they can be up to 55% inaccurate. In 2012, we published a weight-based formula to estimate gastric tube length for insertion. Purpose: This study reviews the rates of correct gastric tube placement, as confirmed by radiography, after the incorporation of this weight-based formula into bedside practice. Methods: A 6-month prospective study was performed in a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit. The formula estimating gastric tube length for insertion had been derived in an earlier study. This was incorporated into the hospital's policies and procedures guideline for the insertion of gastric tubes. Neonates with gastric tubes who required radiography for clinical reasons were included. The infant's weight and the type (orogastric or nasogastric) and length of tube were documented. A single radiologist assessed the tube position to be high, borderline, correct, or long. Results: A total of 195 chest radiographs were obtained. Correct tube position was found in 84% of instances. This was a statistically and clinically significant improvement. Implications for Practice: Implementation of a simple weight-based estimate for gastric tube length improves correct position rates. Implications for Research: Further studies comparing accuracy of length/height and weight-based estimations for gastric tube insertion lengths in very preterm and extremely preterm infants are needed.",

    "abstract": "Although the benefits of skin-to-skin care (SSC) are well documented in the literature, practices in the clinical setting remain inconsistent. Although nurses' reported knowledge about SSC has improved, confusion still exists regarding safety and appropriateness. Existing qualitative literature primarily focuses on parents' experiences; yet it is crucial to describe the essence of professional caregivers' experiences to enhance facilitation and implementation of SSC. Most studies surrounding the caregiver's perspective and SSC have focused on barriers that impede implementation or examined the experience from the organizational perspective and general group experiences rather than individual personal experiences with SSC.This meta-ethnography integrated the findings from several discrete studies into a salient interpretative perspective, creating a relevant understanding of the process of SSC as a means of enhancing facilitation and implementation of SSC with hospitalized infants.An ethnographic meta-synthesis of qualitative literature was completed.As a result of this synthesis, the caregivers' experiences were separated into themes to articulate the phenomena juxtaposed from the 8 original studies that influence facilitation of SSC for the parent-infant dyad. Qualitative data analysis uncovered 4 overarching themes: (1) varying thresholds of getting started; (2) defining adequate resources; (3) navigating the demands and complexity of the infant; and (4) balancing parental readiness with infant needs.This ethnographic meta-synthesis confirms nurses have good intentions in supporting SSC practices, yet struggle to meet competing demands in their daily practice.Innovative and practical translations of SSC are needed to normalize SSC as the daily standard for premature infants.",

However, the location can vary from the well newborn setting to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Purpose: The purpose of this review is to examine differences in LPI discharge criteria between the well newborn setting and the NICU by answering the clinical questions, “What are the recommended discharge criteria for the LPI and do they differ if admitted to the well newborn setting versus the NICU?” Search Strategy: Databases searched include CINAHL, TRIP, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library. Focusing first on the highest level of evidence, position statements, policy statements, and clinical practice guidelines were reviewed, followed by original research. Results: There were few differences shown between settings. Discharge criteria included physiological stability and completed screenings for hearing loss, hyperbilirubinemia, car seat safety, hypoglycemia, critical congenital heart disease, and sepsis. Parent education is provided on umbilical cord care, feeding, elimination, and weight gain norms. Recommended maternal assessment included screenings for depression, drug use, safe home environment, and presence of social support. In general, research supported protecting the mother-infant dyad. Implications for Practice and Research: Developing a standardized approach for discharge criteria for LPIs may improve outcomes and reduce maternal stress. Research is needed to compare health and cost outcomes between settings. Video Abstract available at http://links.lww.com/ANC/A29.",

Three Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles tested its impact on parent partnership in care. Information about developmentally supportive care provided by parents during each 12-hour shift was extracted from nursing documentation. A staff survey evaluated perceptions of the tool and informed modifications.Changes in parent partnership during PDSA 1 did not reach statistical significance. Staff perceived that the tool was generally useful for the patient/family but was sometimes overlooked, prompting its inclusion in the daily goals checklist. For PDSA 2 and 3, parents were more often observed participating in rounds, asking appropriate questions, providing environmental comfort, assisting with the daily care routine, and changing diapers.Use of a bedside visual tool may lead to increased parent partnership in care for infants after cardiac surgery.Future projects are needed to examine the impact of bedside care partnership interventions on parent preparedness, family well-being, and infant outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Background: Infant skin is susceptible to dryness and irritation from external factors, including topical skin care products not formulated for the infant's skin. This may increase the risk of contact dermatitis. Parents frequently express concern regarding potential harm from ingredients in skin care products and seek information. This is complicated by several skin care myths. Purpose: The purpose of this literature review was to provide evidence-based information to educate parents on the use of products for preterm and term infants. Search Strategy: Multiple searches using PubMed were conducted including the search terms “infant skin care,” “infant products,” “infant bath,” “emollients,” “diaper skin care,” and “diaper wipes.” Reference lists of comprehensive reviews were also scanned. Google searches were used to assess consumer information, product information, and regulatory guidelines. Findings: There is little scientific evidence to support safety of natural/organic products on infant skin. Raw materials originate from different sources, complicating testing and comparisons of ingredients. Research shows that cleansers formulated for infant skin do not weaken the skin barrier the way harsher soaps and detergents can. Oils with the lowest oleic acid content provide a lower risk of irritant contact dermatitis. Implications for Practice: Nurses must be informed about natural and organic products, preservatives, and fragrances and know the definition of commonly used marketing terms. Implications for Research: Decisions regarding the use of infant products in preterm and term infants should be evidence based. More research is needed to support claims regarding the safety of products used on infant skin.",

    "abstract": "Background: When posttraumatic growth occurs in clinicians as a result of their caring for patients and families who are traumatized, it is termed vicarious posttraumatic growth. Purpose: (1) To determine the level of vicarious posttraumatic growth and the disruption of core beliefs in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) nurses who have cared for critically ill infants and their families. (2) To explore those quantitative findings through nurses' qualitative descriptions of their growth. Methods: A mixed method with a convergent parallel design was used to address the study aims. A targeted sample of neonatal nurses was recruited from the National Association of Neonatal Nurses (NANN) through the MyNANN Community message board. The sample consisted of 109 NICU nurses who completed the quantitative strand and 61 (55%) who completed the qualitative strand. Nurses completed the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory, the Core Beliefs Inventory, and described their experiences of any positive changes in their beliefs or life as a result of caring for critically ill infants. IBM SPSS 25.0 and Krippendorff's content analysis were used to analyze the quantitative and qualitative data, respectively. Results: NICU nurses reported a moderate degree of vicarious posttraumatic growth and disruption of their assumptive world. Appreciation of Life was the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory dimension that reflected the highest growth and Spiritual Change the lowest. Implications for Practice: Providing posttraumatic growth interventions has the potential to help NICU nurses find meaning through their experience. Implications for Research: Future surveys need to include a higher response rate to generalize the findings. A video abstract is available.

Standards of care support providing PC early after diagnosis with any condition likely to impact quality of life.To determine the state of early PC practice across populations to derive elements of early PC applicable to neonates and their families and demonstrate their application in practice.Multiple literature searches were conducted from 2016 to 2019. Common keywords used were: palliative care; early PC; end of life, neonate; NICU; perinatal PC; pediatric PC; family-centered care; advanced care planning; palliative care consultant; and shared decision-making.Early PC is an emerging practice in adult, pediatric, and perinatal populations that has been shown to be helpful for and recommended by families. Three key elements of early PC in the NICU are shared decision-making, care planning, and coping with distress. A hypothetical case of a 24-week infant is presented to illustrate how findings may be applied. Evidence supports expansion of neonatal PC to include infants and families without terminal diagnoses and initiation earlier in care.Involving parents more fully in care planning activities and decision-making and providing structured support for them to cope with distress despite their child's prognosis are essential to early PC.As early PC is incorporated into practice, strategies should be evaluated for feasibility and efficacy to improve parental and neonatal outcomes. Researchers should consider engaging NICU parent stakeholders in leading early PC program development and research.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 7 out of every 100 births in the United States result in admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), which contributes to a delay in initial physical contact between the parents and their newborn. While family-centered care (FCC) increases opportunities for parent-infant connection, implementation barriers persist in clinical practice. Research has yet to examine whether organizational and nursing factors of empowerment and compassion fatigue (CF) in the NICU are associated with FCC practice.The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between empowerment, CF, and FCC practices among NICU nurses.This quantitative portion of a mixed-methods study used a cross-sectional, descriptive correlational design. Bedside NICU nurses with at least 6-month experience were recruited to complete an anonymous online survey using established, valid, and reliable instruments.Except for organizations with Magnet status, there were no significant differences in FCC practice within individual and institutional characteristics. Hierarchical linear regression model indicated nurse empowerment was a strong predictor of FCC practice (β= 0.31, R2 = 0.35, P < .001). There was only a weak, inverse association between CF and FCC practices ( r =-0.199, P < .001).Further qualitative research will integrate these findings to understand the process by which neonatal nurses engage in FCC practices in the context of NICU setting. Future studies should examine facilitators and barriers of FCC practice in the NICU. Strategies (eg, policies and trainings) to increase nurse empowerment and support for FCC implementation should be developed and evaluated.",

    "abstract": "The neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) stay following the birth of a preterm infant can be stressful and traumatic for families. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the NICU environment changed precipitously as infection control and visitor restriction measures were implemented.Our study aimed to examine the impact of the pandemic policies on the experiences of mothers of preterm infants during their stay in the NICU.Semistructured interviews were conducted with mothers of preterm infants hospitalized in a Canadian tertiary-level NICU. Informed by interpretive description methodology, interview content was transcribed and analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. The identified themes were validated, clarified, or refined using investigator triangulation.Nine English-speaking mothers, aged 28 to 40 years, were interviewed. Four themes emerged from the analysis of their experiences: (1) disrupted family dynamic, support, and bonding; (2) physical and emotional isolation; (3) negative psychological impact compounded by added concerns, maternal role change, and survival mode mentality; and (4) positive aspects of the pandemic management measures.During the pandemic, the way that care was provided in the NICU changed. This study helps to explore how neonatal clinicians can foster individual and organizational resilience to keep patients and families at the center of care, even when the healthcare system is under intense stress.: Our results show that these changes heightened mothers' distress, but also had a modest positive impact. Further research about long-term consequences of pandemic policies on the mother and preterm infant after NICU discharge is warranted.",

Participants included parents of preterm infants who were born less than 34 weeks' gestation during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020-August 2020). Telephone surveys were conducted through open-ended questions. A thematic content analysis identifying themes was performed after interviews were completed and transcribed.A total of 8 mothers completed the telephone survey. Key themes from this study include parents experiencing increased stress due to the restricted visitation policies, limited opportunities to care for their infant, lack of support, and inconsistent communication regarding their infant status and COVID-19 protocols.Suggestions provided to enhance NICU services during the pandemic include increasing parental engagement opportunities to care for their infant in the NICU, enhanced empathy and compassion from the neonatal team, and open and transparent communication.Further research investigating cultural impact on parents' perspectives, perspectives of fathers, long-term impact of how parents coped after discharge from the NICU, and emotional impact on NICU staff members may be beneficial to aid improvements in NICU service delivery during the ongoing and future pandemic.",

Purpose: The purpose of this systematic review was to examine routine nurse caregiving in the neonatal intensive care unit and its effect on stress responses and behavior state in preterm infants. Data Sources: A systematic search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL for studies published between 2013 and 2023. Study Selection: Included studies enrolled preterm infants born &lt;37 weeks gestational age and investigated nurse caregiving practices and effects on stress responses and/or behavior state. Data Extraction: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, data about study design, methods, findings, and limitations were extracted and summarized. Included studies were evaluated for bias using the National Health, Lung, and Blood Institute quality assessment tools. Results: All 13 studies included in the review received a fair quality rating. Nurse caregiving activities, including suctioning, diaper changes, bathing, and weighing, were associated with increases in heart and respiratory rates, blood pressure, energy expenditure, and motor responses, lower oxygen saturations, and fewer sleep states. Implications for Practice and Research: Adapting nurse caregiving frequency and duration, aligning caregiving with infant state, and integrating developmental care strategies may reduce infant stress responses and support behavioral rest. Further research is needed to understand how caregiving activities affect stress responses and behavior state in preterm infants, aiding in identifying modifiable caregiving stressors to promote optimal development.",

Mortality from NEC is 7% and occurs in 1 out of 1000 preterm infants. Studies have shown the efficacy of an exclusive milk from mother diet in decreasing rates of NEC and associated mortality. Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness of an existing exclusive human milk diet (EHMD) protocol on the incidence of NEC in extremely premature infants. EHMD, for the purposes of this project is defined as breast milk of mother, with or without human milk-based fortifier. Methods: A single-center retrospective quasi-experimental study. The sample included 201 infants born less than 32 weeks gestation, weighing less than 1250 grams, small for gestational age (SGA) and with low Apgar scores. Outcomes measured included incidences of NEC, mortality, and co-morbidities in infants pre- and postinitiation of an EHMD protocol. Results: Just 4.8% of the EHMD group had a NEC diagnosis compared to 10.5% of the bovine-based (BOV) group. There was a 1% mortality rate of the EHMD group as compared to 6% in the BOV group. The EHMD group had a statistically significant greater weight gain during hospitalization as compared to infants fed BOV ( P = &lt; .05). Implications for Practice and Research: Neonatal intensive care units should consider EHMDs for use in this infant population. Future research is needed to support dissemination of the use of EHMD as standard of practice.",

This randomized controlled trial examined the effect of the mother's own milk odor and white noise on pain management during heel lance in preterms. The data were collected in the neonatal intensive care unit and postpartum services between May and October 2022. The study included 66 infants born between 34 and 37 weeks. Infants were randomly assigned to either the mother's own milk odor, white noise, or control groups. Data were collected using the Premature Infant Pain Profile-Revised Form, Descriptive Information Form, and Follow-Up Chart. Pain was evaluated 5 and 2 minutes before the procedure, at the time and 5 minutes after the procedure by 2 independent nursing academicians/lecturers through video recordings. Frequency, mean, standard deviation, chi-square test, one-way ANOVA and repeated measures were used for data analysis. All groups were similar regarding the descriptive characteristics. The control group had higher heart rates before and after the procedure than the mother's own milk odor and white noise group. Oxygen saturation was higher and pain scores were lower in the white noise and mother's own milk odor group compared to the control group during and after the procedure. There was no difference between the mother's milk odor and white noise groups at any time. The odor of the mother's milk and white noise may effectively manage pain during heel lance in preterms. Neonatal nurses can adopt these methods as effective non-pharmacological pain management methods.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Insertion of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) is a commonly performed procedure in both preterm and term infants. Tetracaine 4% gel (Ametop; Smith & Nephew Inc, St. Laurent, Quebec), a topical anesthetic, although reported to be effective for reducing the pain of venipuncture in neonates, has not been investigated for the management of pain associated with the PICC procedure. PURPOSE To determine the efficacy of tetracaine gel for managing the pain associated with the PICC procedure in preterm and term infants. METHODS A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial (RCT) design was used. Infants undergoing nonurgent PICC insertion were randomized to receive either the treatment (1.0 g of tetracaine 4% gel) or placebo control (1.0 g of eucerin-plus cream) applied to the skin under occlusion for 30 minutes before the procedure. Data on the behavioral (facial expression) and physiologic (heart rate and oxygen saturation) indicators of pain were collected via videotaping and computer monitoring throughout the procedure. Data then were coded and measured by independent observers using the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP; Stevens et al, 1996), and analyzed using descriptive statistics and repeated-measures analyses of variance. RESULTS Forty-nine infants, gestational age 27 to 41 weeks (mean = 33; SD = 4.2) and age at time of insertion 2 to 85 days (mean = 18; SD = 22.5) participated. No differences were found between the groups at the time of randomization. There were no adverse cardiorespiratory events or local skin reactions in either group. There was a significant within-subjects main effect of time across the procedure (F[48,3] = 11.03; P < 0.0001). There was no significant between-subjects main effect of group (F[48,1] = 0.11; P = 0.74) and no (group × time) interaction (F[48,3] = 0.45; P = 0.72). CONCLUSION Tetracaine gel was not effective for pain relief for PICC insertion in infants. Its use for pain relief cannot be recommended based on the results of this study. Other pharmacologic, behavioral, and physical interventions should be investigated for safety and relief of procedural pain in this population of infants.",

In the midst of these emotions they must learn to provide for the special needs of their infant. Providing parents with the knowledge and skills to care for their infant during this stressful time requires the concerted effort of a multidisciplinary team who can provide clear, concise, and consistent communication. This article provides a step-by-step guide to the information needs of families who are preparing to take their infants home after cardiac surgery. Parents must understand the underlying cardiac defect and the goals and objectives of the surgical repair. In addition to normal newborn care, parents need to learn about care of the incision, nutritional support, and how to safely administer prescribed medications. Potential complications and when to call their health care provider or seek emergency care are an important focus of teaching. Information about infant development, challenges specific to their infant, and pragmatic strategies to support normal development are of prime interest to parents. Written reference materials, a Web resource list, and a family discharge teaching tool provide tangible resources for the family after discharge.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE Swedish hospitals apply various regimens for preterm infants' nutrition in connection with their mothers' establishment of breastfeeding. Milk intake is assessed either by test weighing before and after breastfeeding or by observing the infant's suckling behavior (ie, clinical indices). These differing policies may lead to differences in infants' feeding progress. The purpose of this study was to compare effects on breastfeeding and weight gain of preterm infants, depending on whether the volume of breast milk intake when suckled in the hospital was estimated by \"clinical indices\" or determined by test weighing. SUBJECTS Sixty-four infants treated at a unit applying test weighing were compared with 59 infants treated at a unit assessing milk intake by \"clinical indices.\" DESIGN AND METHODS A retrospective, descriptive, and comparative design was used to explore the consequences of different nutrition regimens. Data were obtained from a review of hospital medical records. PRINCIPAL RESULTS The infants treated at the hospital where test weighing was practiced attained exclusive breastfeeding at an earlier postmenstrual age (PMA) and were also discharged at an earlier PMA. However, the 2 study units were alike regarding the proportion of infants attaining exclusive breastfeeding, the postnatal age when this occurred, and the weight pattern in hospital. CONCLUSION To establish breastfeeding in preterm infants, test weighing before and after breastfeeding and gradual reduction of supplementation are both applicable regimens. Mothers can be encouraged to choose either of them, although test weighing may help infants attain exclusive breastfeeding at an earlier PMA.",

This rare autosomal dominant disorder affects approximately 1:50 000 live births. It primarily affects the development of facial structures through a mutation in the TCOF1 gene found at the 5q32–33.1 loci. While common facies and phenotype can be described with this syndrome, the gene has a wide variation of expressivity, thus making the diagnosis of mild cases challenging. This study involves a term female diagnosed with Treacher Collins syndrome, who was also diagnosed with Tracheal Esophageal Fistula. She is expected to be of normal intelligence but, as is typical for Treacher Collins syndrome, has conductive hearing loss and therefore is at risk for developmental delay.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of oral sucrose solution on pain responses of neonates to arterial puncture compared with neonates who did not receive a sucrose solution. SUBJECTS: Convenience sample of 47 neonates, 31 to 35 weeks' gestational age. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized controlled trial. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Changes in pain response during and after an arterial puncture. METHODS: Infants were randomly assigned to receive a 24% sucrose solution or usual care (comfort measures only) 2 minutes before an arterial puncture. Pain, heart rate, and oxygen saturation were measured before, during, and after an arterial puncture. Chi-square analysis was used to determine group differences, with P < .05 considered significant. RESULTS: Forty-seven subjects were studied during arterial puncture (sucrose, 24; no sucrose, 23). Neonates receiving sucrose solution had significantly less crying than the no sucrose group, both during and immediately after an arterial puncture (P = .006 and .022, respectively). No significant changes in other pain subscales, heart rate, or oxygen saturation were found during or after the arterial puncture (P > .05). CONCLUSION: This study found a significant reduction in the crying subscale of the Neonatal Infant Pain subscale immediately after the introduction of an arterial needle in neonates receiving a 24% sucrose solution, compared with those who did not receive sucrose solution. While prior studies found a similar reduction in pain scores after heel and venipuncture needlesticks, this is the first study evaluating a high concentration of oral sucrose to blunt the pain associated with an arterial puncture.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hypothermia is an independent contributor to neonatal mortality. All very low-birth-weight (VLBW) newborns have the potential to undergo cold stress or frank hypothermia during delivery room stabilization. Thus, clinicians aiming to maintain normothermia in VLBW neonates are compelled to use multiple adjuncts of unknown efficacy or safety. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of thermoregulation procedures in maintaining normothermia during delivery room resuscitation and to assess the impact of an unanticipated change in equipment at our institution on the admission temperatures of VLBW newborns. DESIGN/METHODS: Institutional review board—approved, retrospective analysis of quality assurance data submitted to the Vermont-Oxford Network (VON) for 24 consecutive months starting January 2006. We compared the rate of hypothermia (admission temperature < 36.5°C) in our NICU during 2006 with the aggregate rates reported by VON. We then compared the rates of hypothermia and mean admission temperatures in our NICU during period 1 (when chemical warming packs were used routinely, in addition to plastic wrapping and warm blankets) and period 2 (after packs were discontinued owing to an incident of focal skin injury). RESULTS: In 2006, 42% of VLBW babies in our NICU had an admission temperature of less than 36.5°C compared with the VON rate of 61% (interquartile range 48%, 76%). During period 1, 39% of 183 VLBW neonates were hypothermic compared with 68% of 103 during period 2 (P < .001). Mean admission temperatures during periods 1 and 2 were 36.5°C and 36.1°C, respectively (P < .001). A control chart showed the shift in temperatures occurring as period 2 began. No change in practice other than discontinuation of the warming packs was instituted during period 2. The incidence of temperatures greater than 38°C (hyperthermia) was 1.6% during period 1 and 1.0% during period 2. CONCLUSIONS: The results associated with this isolated change in practice at our institution suggest that chemical warming packs were a useful adjunct in achieving above-average rates of normothermia during delivery room resuscitation of VLBW newborns. Their potential adverse effects should be weighed against the increased risk of mortality associated with hypothermia in this population.",

In 2009, CLABIs were on the increase at Covenant Healthcare's 55 bed Level III neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Prior to this practice initiative, there were no standardized central line management practices in the NICU. We retrospectively reviewed the incidence CLABIs for the six months prior to the initiation of the standardization of central line management and then 3 months following the implementation of the new practice policy. Specific outcomes measured were the number of CLABIs, length of stay related to CLABIs, and adherence to the policies and procedures. The project was implemented in four phases: 1) hand hygiene, 2) \"scrub the hub\", 3) central line tubing changes, 4) central line insertion, removal, and dressing changes. Although there were no statistically significant changes in the outcome measures, there were clinically significant differences between length of stay and risk for central line infection, incidence of CLABIs, and an increase in adherence to the central line practice change policies. The study showed for every week that is added to the patient stay, the patient was 7 times more likely to have a CLABIs. The rate of central line infection was decreased from 15.6 percent per 1000 line days to zero in 2010.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: In neonates, the course of illness is often unpredictable and symptom assessment is difficult. This is even truer at the end of life (EOL). Time to death can take minutes to days, and ongoing management of the infant is needed during the time between discontinuation of life-sustaining treatment and death to ensure that the infant remains free of pain and suffering. The symptoms experienced by neonates as they die, as well as best ways to treat those symptoms, are understudied. The purpose of this study was to examine symptoms exhibited by neonates at the EOL and the treatments used to manage those symptoms as documented in the medical record during the last 24 hours of life. Subjects: The sample included 20 neonates who died at a large children's hospital. Design: This was an exploratory, descriptive study. Methods: Descriptive data, such as diagnosis, ongoing therapy at time of treatment withdrawal or withholding, pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions associated with treatment withdrawal, time of treatment withdrawal and death, age at time of death, signs and symptoms exhibited during EOL care, and pain scores, were abstracted from the infant's medical record. Main Outcome Measures: Inadequate documentation in the medical record resulted in missing data that made it not possible to fully explore aspects of symptom management during the last 24 hours of life; however, some important results were found. Results: This study showed a difference in the way neonates approach the EOL period. Other findings were that most infants in the study received pain medication, even though pain scores were infrequently documented and drug dosages varied across infants. Finally, documentation of nonpharmacologic interventions utilized at the EOL was also lacking.",

    "abstract": "Background: Maintaining normothermia and prevention of hypothermia are critical determinants of morbidity and mortality in infants. Noninvasive monitoring of skin temperature using skin temperature probes (STPs) has been a practice in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) for decades. Incubators and radiant warmers use feedback mechanisms from the STP readings to determine the heat output to maintain normothermia. Placing the STP on an ideal site on the infant's body is essential for optimum servo control of the temperature. More importantly, where is the ideal site for the STP placement? Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) vary on information regarding the site and proper placement of the STPs. The literature is analyzed to identify evidence for the ideal STP placement on infants in NICUs. Purpose: To review the literature for evidence for ideal placement for skin temperature probe placement on an infant. Search Strategy: OVID/MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane databases, and CPGs were searched to identify research, literature reviews, and guidelines for ideal sites for STP placement. Twenty documents were reviewed. Results: Guidelines vary in suggested sites for STP placement. The majority of the studies compared temperature measurement between abdomen and axilla. Although a Cochrane review found abdominal skin as an ideal site, other studies did not find any difference between axially and abdominal skin temperature measurements. Implications for Practice and Research: Placing the STP on an ideal site is essential for accurate and safe monitoring of skin temperature in infants. NICU nurses are uniquely positioned to undertake research to identify the ideal site for STP placement to guide safe practice and impact optimal neonatal outcome.",

    "abstract": "Background: Transient asymptomatic neonatal hypoglycemia (TANH) is common as infants transition from their mother's energy stores to their own. There is little evidence supporting the blood glucose threshold that indicates a need for treatment although sustained hypoglycemia has been correlated with negative neurodevelopmental consequences. Treatment of TANH includes a stepwise approach from supplemental enteral feedings, buccal glucose gel, intravenous dextrose infusion, and/or transfer to special care units including neonatal intensive care units. Purpose: The purpose of this evidence-based practice brief is to review current evidence on 40% buccal glucose gel administration as a treatment strategy for TANH. Methods/Search Strategy: CINAHL, Cochrane, Google Scholar, and PubMed were searched using the key words and restricted to English language over the last 7 years. Findings/Results: The use of buccal dextrose gel for TANH may reduce neonatal intensive care unit admissions, reduce hospital length of stay and cost, support the mother–infant dyad through reduced separation, support exclusive breastfeeding, and improve parental satisfaction without adverse neurodevelopmental consequences. Implications for Practice: Timely collection of blood glucose levels following intervention is critical to support clinical decisions. Clinicians should offer family education regarding the rationale for serial glucose monitoring and treatment indications including buccal glucose administration. Clinical protocols can be revised to include use of buccal dextrose gel. Implications for Research: There is a need for rigorous long-term studies comparing treatment thresholds and neurodevelopmental outcomes among various treatment strategies for TANH.",

Confusion exists regarding the accuracy of methods to determine FT insertion length and verify gastric FT placement, and it is unknown whether evidence-based methods are used by neonatal nurses. Purpose: To compare individual and unit-based neonatal nursing practices regarding methods used to determine FT insertion length and verify gastric FT placement. Methods: Neonatal nurses were surveyed about individual and unit-based practices regarding methods used to determine FT insertion length and verify gastric FT placement in infants in the neonatal intensive care unit. Results: Sixty neonatal nurses completed the survey, with 63% utilizing the nose-ear-midway to the umbilicus method, which was included in 50% of protocols and is associated with up to a 90% accuracy rate. Although it has an unacceptably high inaccuracy rate, the nose-to-ear-to-xiphoid method was used by 32% of nurses and recommended in 30% of protocols. To verify gastric FT placement, 98% of nurses used auscultation of a whoosh sound and 83% used aspiration of gastric contents. Neither verification method is supported by evidence or recommended for use. Implications for Practice: A lack of consistency exists between nursing practice and evidence-based methods. Implications for Research: Research is needed to determine more accurate and reliable ways to determine FT insertion depth and verify gastric FT placement in neonates.",

Better understanding of the research evidence on the effect of the side-lying position will help clinicians make informed decisions and guide future research in this important area.To identify and summarize the available evidence on the effect of side-lying position on oral feeding outcomes in preterm infants.PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science and PsycINFO were searched for (\"preterm\" OR \"premature\") AND \"feed*\" AND \"position*\". The full text of 47 articles was reviewed to identify eligible studies that use a quasi-experimental or experimental design to examine the intervention effectiveness; 4 studies met criteria.Four studies compared the effect of the side-lying position with either the semi-upright, cradle-hold, or semi-reclined positions on various feeding outcomes. The findings were conflicting: 2 studies found the side-lying position to be beneficial for supporting physiologic stability during feeding compared with the semi-upright position whereas 2 studies did not find significant differences in any of their outcomes between the side-lying position and other feeding positions. However, this finding should be interpreted cautiously because of various methodological weaknesses and limited generalizability.This review does not provide strong or consistent evidence that the side-lying position improves preterm infants' oral feeding outcomes.A large randomized controlled trial with a diverse group of preterm infants is needed to determine the effects of the side-lying position and identify infants who would receive the most benefit.Video Abstract Available at https://journals.lww.com/advancesinneonatalcare/Pages/videogallery.aspx.",

Hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and early-onset sepsis are common problems related to prematurity. Implementation of a Golden Hour protocol has been shown to improve outcomes for preterm infants. Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness of a Golden Hour protocol for infants born at less than 32 weeks' gestation on improving the admission process in a military care facility. Specific aims focused on temperature, time to initiation of intravenous (IV) fluids, time to administration of antibiotics, and time to close of the incubator top. Methods: A pre-/postdesign was used to compare outcomes from preimplementation to postimplementation. Predata were collected using electronic health record chart review and postdata were collected from the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit admission worksheet. Results: Although we did not find statistical significance, we found that more infants had a temperature greater than 36.5°C within 1 hour of birth and decrease in time to initiation of IV fluids and antibiotics from preimplementation to postimplementation, which is clinically significant. Time to close of the incubator top remained greater than 1 hour. Implications for Practice: Implementation of a Golden Hour protocol provides a guide to caring for preterm infants during the first hour of life to improve patient outcomes. Involvement of key stakeholders and staff education are key to successful implementation. Implications for Research: Researchers should examine long-term outcomes related to implementation of a Golden Hour protocol in future studies. Future quality improvement projects should include the effectiveness of similar protocols and address possible barriers.",

    "abstract": "Appropriate thermoregulation affects both morbidity and mortality in the neonatal setting. Nurses rely on information from temperature sensors and radiant warmers or incubators to appropriately maintain a neonate's body temperature. Skin temperature sensors must be repositioned to prevent skin irritation and breakdown. This study addresses whether there is a significant difference between skin sensor temperature readings from 3 locations on the neonate and whether there is a significant difference between skin sensor temperatures compared with digital axillary temperatures.The study participants included 36 hemodynamically stable neonates, with birth weight of 750 g or more and postnatal age of 15 days or more, in a neonatal intensive care unit. Gestational age ranged from 29.6 to 36.1 weeks at the time of data collection.A method-comparison design was used to evaluate the level of agreement between skin sensor temperatures and digital axillary thermometer measurements.When the neonate's skin sensor was scheduled for routine site change, 3 new skin sensors were placed-1 each on the right upper abdomen, left flank, and right axilla. The neonate was placed in a supine position and redressed or rewrapped if previously dressed or wrapped. Subjects served as their own controls, with temperatures measured at all 3 skin sensor sites and followed by a digital thermometer measurement in the left axilla. The order of skin sensor temperature measurements was randomly assigned by a computer-generated number sequence.An analysis of variance for repeated measures was used to test for statistical differences between the skin sensor temperatures. The difference in axillary and skin sensor temperatures was calculated by subtracting the reference standard temperature (digital axillary) from the test temperatures (skin temperatures at 3 different locations), using the Bland-Altman method. The level of significance was set at P < .05.No statistically significant differences were found between skin temperature readings obtained from the 3 sites (F2,70 = 2.993, P = .57). Differences between skin temperature readings and digital axillary temperature were also not significant when Bland-Altman graphs were plotted.For hemodynamically stable neonates in a supine position, there were no significant differences between skin sensor temperatures on abdomen, flank, or axilla or between skin sensor temperatures and a digital axillary temperature. This may increase nurses' confidence that various sites will produce accurate temperature readings.",

The aim of this study was to improve consistency of pain assessment documentation through implementation of a multidimensional neonatal pain and sedation assessment tool. The study was set in a 60-bed level IV NICU within an urban children's hospital. Participants included NICU staff, including registered nurses, neonatal nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, pharmacists, neonatal fellows, and neonatologists. The Plan Do Study Act method of quality improvement was used for this project. Baseline assessment included review of patient medical records 6 months before the intervention. Documentation of pain assessment on admission, routine pain assessment, reassessment of pain after an elevated pain score, discussion of pain in multidisciplinary rounds, and documentation of pain assessment were reviewed. Literature review and listserv query were conducted to identify neonatal pain tools. Survey of staff was conducted to evaluate knowledge of neonatal pain and also to determine current healthcare providers' practice as related to identification and treatment of neonatal pain. A multidimensional neonatal pain tool, the Neonatal Pain, Agitation, and Sedation Scale (N-PASS), was chosen by the staff for implementation. Six months and 2 years following education on the use of the N-PASS and implementation in the NICU, a chart review of all hospitalized patients was conducted to evaluate documentation of pain assessment on admission, routine pain assessment, reassessment of pain after an elevated pain score, discussion of pain in multidisciplinary rounds, and documentation of pain assessment in the medical progress note. Documentation of pain scores improved from 60% to 100% at 6 months and remained at 99% 2 years following implementation of the N-PASS. Pain score documentation with ongoing nursing assessment improved from 55% to greater than 90% at 6 months and 2 years following the intervention. Pain assessment documentation following intervention of an elevated pain score was 0% before implementation of the N-PASS and improved slightly to 30% 6 months and 47% 2 years following implementation. Identification and implementation of a multidimensional neonatal pain assessment tool, the N-PASS, improved documentation of pain in our unit. Although improvement in all quality improvement monitors was noted, additional work is needed in several key areas, specifically documentation of reassessment of pain following an intervention for an elevated pain score.",

We initiated a series of quality improvement cycles designed to reduce delays in the initiation of antibiotic therapy to less than 2 hours when hospital-acquired infection (HAI) was suspected. All infants in this study were in neonatal intensive care (level II or III) who were started on antibiotics for a suspected HAI (defined as an infection that occurred 72 hours after admission to the NICU) were audited. Through a series of quality improvement cycles, we analyzed sources of delays in the initiation of antibiotic therapy from the time the order was written through administration. In subsequent cycles, we intervened to reduce delays through education, standardize the evaluation process, and develop an online ordering system that streamlined the workflow patterns in the nurseries and pharmacy. Using a prospective cohort design, we compared antibiotic delivery times after each process improvement cycle. Antibiotic delivery time was reduced from a median of 137.5 minutes to 75 minutes and variation of practice was reduced in terms of standard deviation and range (P < .001). The use of computerized physician order entry significantly improved the writing of STAT orders (P < .0001). A systematic analysis of workflow patterns and efficiencies, coupled with improvement cycles targeting delays and development of a computerized physician order entry system, allowed us to improve antibiotic delivery time in neonates with suspected HAI in an intensive care nursery system.",

    "abstract": "Does your institution value human milk? Are there institutional barriers in place that do not support the use of human milk and breastfeeding? What facilitators are present? The Centers for Disease Control (since 2007) conducts the biennial Maternity Practices in Infant Nutrition and Care (mPINC) survey to all birth hospitals in the United States.1 The mPINC survey covers 7 domains of care that influence breastfeeding including: labor and delivery, postpartum care routines, provision of breastfeeding assistance, maternal-infant contact including rooming-in, breastfeeding support at discharge, structural and organizational components to support breastfeeding, and staff education.1 The most current mPINC data available (2011) shows an average national score of 70/100 possible points.1 With national average scores being this low, it is clear that many institutions may not value human milk and breastfeeding or make it a priority in terms of financial, time, and other resources. If all birth hospitals and all children's hospitals provided evidence based lactation support and care, I am confident that breastfeeding initiation, duration, and exclusivity rates in the United States would be much higher. Currently, a mere 16.4% of infants receive exclusive human milk for the first 6 months.2 Clearly, there is work to be done. When considering how to change your institution's culture to make it more supportive of human milk and breastfeeding, consider using the \"evidence-based management\" strategy developed by Pfeffer and Sutton.3 In my role as a nurse researcher and manager of the Lactation Program at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), I have used this model in implementing change for more than 10 years. There are 5 basic tenets of evidence-based management: Face the hard facts and encourage people to tell the truth even if it is unpleasant,3 \"Fact-based\" decision making is essential,3 Treat your organization as an unfinished prototype,3 Look for risks and drawbacks,3 and Avoid basing decisions on untested but strongly held beliefs.3 When you consider these statements and think of your own institution and apply the model to human milk and breastfeeding, it will be easy to see how you can improve and change your institution's culture to be more supportive of breastfeeding. Consider step 1. Breastfeeding is not always the most popular topic. Have you ever heard a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) nurse say \"I can't help that mom breastfeed\" or have you met staff who are squeamish about human milk? In our current U.S. culture, breastfeeding is not the cultural norm. Therefore, many nurses and other health professionals have little exposure to or knowledge about breastfeeding. The \"Surgeon General's Call to Breastfeeding Action\" explicitly addresses the need for health professional education and training.4 Within the university portion of my job, I provide an entire semester (28 hours of lecture and 14 hours of clinical time) undergraduate course on breastfeeding and human lactation5 and as an aspect of the clinical portion of my job I developed the breastfeeding resource nurse (BRN) model.6 BRNs receive an intensive 2-day educational course focused specifically on human milk and breastfeeding in the context of a children's hospital.6 Nurses receive continuing education credit and are paid to take the course. The BRN serves as a resource to our families and to other staff in their patient care area.6 BRNs take a 4-hour refresher course every 2 years to stay up to date on current research and policies. To provide excellent care, health professionals must have excellent education and training. Step 2 and 5 go hand in hand; we need to use the best available evidence and if we do not know where the gaps in care are, we need to collect data. The evidence that human milk and breastfeeding is the preferred form of infant nutrition for all infants is clear.7 As noted in the ethics article, we have a significant role as health professionals in ensuring that all NICU infants receive a human milk diet. However, when trying to change practice, health professionals do not always know where to start. You need to begin by collecting data and determining where the gaps in care are in your healthcare setting. Which directly relates to step 4 of understanding any risks and drawbacks related to making your planned change? I would encourage you to start by making a list of all the positive components in your institution that support the use of human milk and breastfeeding and all the negative components or barriers. Things to consider include: Do you have an adequate number of refrigerators and freezers for storing human milk? Do you have an adequate number of breast pumps for your mothers to use at the infants' bedsides? Do you have a human milk management system in place? Do all staff have specific required education related to the use of human milk and breastfeeding in the NICU? Are there appropriate educational materials? Do all health professionals send the message to families that human milk is an essential required component of caring for a critically ill infant? And are mothers and their families presented with specific information about how human milk can improve the health and developmental outcomes of their child allowing them to make an informed decision. Step 3 is essential for evolving institutional culture: \"Treating your institution as an unfinished prototype.\" At CHOP, we have an interdisciplinary hospital-wide breastfeeding committee that meets monthly to ensure that every day, every month, every year, we are continually working to make our institutional culture the best that it can be to support the use of human milk and breastfeeding. The participation of the hospital wide committee members has been integral to ensuring the cultural change permeates the entire institution. It is not enough for a hospital to have the availability of lactation consultants—all members of the healthcare team must be supportive of human milk and breastfeeding. Nurses in particular play a critical role in ensuring that families receive evidence based support and advice while an infant is being cared for in the NICU. 8 At CHOP, we use World Breastfeeding Week (WBW) as a way to continuously improve our institutional culture. Every year, the World Alliance for Breastfeeding Action (WABA) sets a theme for WBW which is celebrated August 1-7. The 2014 theme is \"Breastfeeding: A Winning Goal for Life.\"9 We use WBW as a way to increase awareness about human milk and breastfeeding and its importance. Hospital employees, families of patients, visitors and local community members are invited to participate in the week's events. Each year a WBW grand rounds is held during the week and the scholarly presentation is opened to all hospital staff and lactation professionals from the community. We have a lobby display with educational materials about human milk and breastfeeding and local community resources. Donations are obtained from local businesses, so that when participants visit the display and fill out a short quiz, they can enter to win a variety of gifts. And perhaps, the event that provides the most hospital-wide and community impact is the WBW poster competition. All inpatient units are invited to develop 2 posters (1 for their unit and 1 for the main hospital atrium, where it can be seen by anyone who visits CHOP). These posters are displayed in the lobby for the week and most posters stay on the unit's for the whole month and sometimes the whole year. Through these posters, hospital employees, families, and visitors are consistently exposed to positive messaging regarding breastfeeding. I believe the impact of our WBW events is substantial. For those of us privileged to care for the most vulnerable of patients, infants in the NICU, it is our responsibility to ensure that these infants have access to human milk. It is essential that we question our practice on a daily basis to make sure that we are providing the best evidence based lactation support and care by all members of the health care team. As Surgeon General Regina Benjamin states: \"We all have a role in supporting breastfeeding.\"4 Let's make sure we work together so the institutions we work in support and value human milk and breastfeeding.

    "abstract": "Premature infants have an increased risk for developing skin breakdown. Perceivably noninvasive interventions may have detrimental effects on the infant's skin.This case presentation describes an extreme case of nasal breakdown associated with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP).Highlighted is the vital importance of proper placement, along with appropriate apparatus size, in the efforts to prevent skin breakdown. Ensuring that pressure points are avoided is imperative to prevent nCPAP-related injuries, along with treating the area in the event of skin denudation. A literature search was conducted to determine best practice options to prevent these injuries.There is little information in the literature to guide treatment and prevention of this type of breakdown.Avoidance of pressure in a localized area is the most commonly found recommendation.There are extensive opportunities for adding to our current knowledge in terms of prevention and treatment of skin breakdown associated with device utilization in the neonatal intensive care unit, especially with the increasing use of nCPAP.",

    "abstract": "Background: Structured training courses have shown to improve patient outcomes; however, guidelines are inconsistently applied in up to 50% of all neonatal resuscitations. This is partly due to the fact that psychomotor skills needed for resuscitation decay within 6 months to a year from the completion of a certification course. Currently, there are no recommendations on how often refresher training should occur to prevent skill decay. Purpose: Improve provider proficiency and confidence in the performance of neonatal resuscitation with a focus on chest compression effectiveness. Methods: The study recruited neonatal intensive care unit providers (n = 25). A simulation-based Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) curriculum was developed and executed. Training sessions were delivered utilizing in situ simulations at varying time intervals. Pre- and postconfidence surveys and practicum skill scores were collected and evaluated by a content expert. Categorical data were summarized by frequency and percentage and tested for distributional equality via Pearson chi-square tests or Fisher exact tests depending on cell sample size distribution. All statistical tests were 2-sided with P &lt; .05 considered statistically significant. Results: Provider overall confidence and rate of chest compressions improved; however, there was no statistically significant difference between groups. Rolling refresher training at varied time intervals did not demonstrate statistically significant differences in chest compression quality among NRP providers. Implications for Practice: Rolling refresher training more frequently than every 6 months may not provide added benefit to NRP providers. Implications for Research: Additional research is needed to determine optimal refresher training frequency to prevent skill decay.",

However, most of the trials used unfortified donor milk, which limits the ability to generalize the results to current clinical practice.To evaluate the impact of early human milk feeding (donor milk and/or mother's own milk) with standard fortification on in-hospital growth of very low-birth-weight infants.This pre-/postretrospective study included selected newborn infants less than 1500 g admitted to a level IV neonatal intensive care unit before and after the introduction of a policy providing donor milk when mother's own milk was not available in sufficient quantity to meet her infant's need. When enteral feeds reached 80 mL/kg per day, all human milk was fortified.Seventy-two \"before\" (any formula-fed) and 114 \"after\" (human milk-fed) infants were enrolled in this study. Infant characteristics and neonatal morbidity were similar in both groups. Outcomes revealed that an initial human milk diet with standard fortification was associated with significantly higher early extrauterine weight gain and head growth in very low-birth-weight infants than a formula-fed diet.Very early initiation of fortified breast and/or donor milk feeding can help promote in-hospital head growth and weight gain of preterm infants. Formula may not be appropriate for early use among preterm infants.Further large-scale clinical trials are needed to determine the best initiation and composition of enteral feeding for preterm infants.",

    "abstract": "Background: Preterm neonates often have feed intolerance that needs to be differentiated from necrotizing enterocolitis. Gastric residual volumes (GRV) are used to assess feed tolerance but with little scientific basis. Purpose: To compare prefeed aspiration for GRV and prefeed measurement of abdominal girth (AG) in the time taken to reach full feeds in preterm infants. Methods: This was a randomized controlled trial. Infants with a gestational age of 27 to 37 weeks and birth weight of 750 to 2000 g, who required gavage feeds for at least 48 hours, were included. Infants were randomized into 2 groups: infants in the AG group had only prefeed AG measured. Those in the GRV group had prefeed gastric aspiration obtained for the assessment of GRV. The primary outcome was time to reach full enteral feeds at 150 mL/kg/d, tolerated for at least 24 hours. Secondary outcomes were duration of hospital stay, need for parenteral nutrition, episodes of feed intolerance, number of feeds withheld, and sepsis. Results: Infants in the AG group reached full feeds earlier than infants in the GRV group (6 vs 9.5 days; P = .04). No significant differences were found between the 2 groups with regard to secondary outcomes. Implications for Practice: Our research suggests that measurement of AG without assessment of GRV enables preterm neonates to reach full feeds faster than checking for GRV. Implications for Research: Abdominal girth measurement as a marker for feed tolerance needs to be studied in infants less than 750 g and less than 26 weeks of gestation.",

Newborn babies survive at gestational ages of 23 to 26 weeks, earlier than when BPD was first described. New mechanisms of lung injury have therefore emerged and the clinical and pathological characteristics of pulmonary involvement have changed.Improved neonatal intensive care unit modalities have increased survival rates; the overall prevalence of the condition, however, has not changed. Management of evolving BPD aims at minimizing lung injury. Management of established, especially severe BPD, still poses significant clinical challenge as these babies need long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) for variable length of time. We aim to give an overview of management of established BPD with particular focus on weaning home oxygen therapy at our local center in the United Kingdom.On the basis of most recent evidence, we concluded that an integrated pathway for managing babies on LTOT is very important after discharge from neonatal unit.A structured weaning pathway for premature babies on home oxygen improves outcome.The management of severe BPD and related complications, particularly during the first 2 years of life, remains a continuing challenge for parents and healthcare providers. The most beneficial respiratory support strategy to minimize lung injury and/or promote lung healing remains unclear and requires further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Background: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the second most frequent hospital-acquired infection in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and significantly affects neonatal morbidity and mortality. The population most at risk for VAP are extremely preterm infants. Purpose: The objectives of this quality improvement project were to create and evaluate the effectiveness of a VAP prevention bundle (“ZAP-VAP”) in reducing VAP. Methods: The development of the ZAP-VAP bundle and creation of audit tools were documented. A targeted gestational age less than 29 weeks was selected for this study. Electronic medical record review was used to determine the preintervention baseline for patient outcomes. Patient medical record data were analyzed retrospectively to measure patient outcomes preimplementation. VAP rates (number of VAP cases per 1000 ventilator days) were calculated pre- and postintervention. After implementation, data were analyzed prospectively to measure patient outcomes between neonates who developed VAP and those who did not. Results: The VAP rate significantly decreased from 8.5 (2010-2011) to 2.5 ( P = .0004) postintervention (2016). Median mechanical ventilation days decreased among VAP cases (47 vs 33 days) and slightly increased among non-VAP cases (19 vs 24 days) during the intervention period. Median length of stay decreased for VAP cases (136 vs 100 days) but remained unchanged for non-VAP cases (85 vs 84 days). Implications for Practice: The intervention was implemented from 2012 to 2016. The protocol was readily accepted by our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) team through education and practice changes. ZAP-VAP is an effective and straightforward protocol that improved VAP outcomes in our level IIIB NICU. An interdisciplinary team successfully implemented this intervention for mechanically ventilated infants of all gestational ages in our unit and has been a model for these practice changes in other units and other hospitals. Implications for Research: Future studies should focus on how to create sustainable interventions to decrease VAP in NICUs and to expand the approaches to other units in our hospital and other hospitals in our city among patients at risk for VAP.",

Specific aims included the use of increased delivery/operating room temperatures and proper use of thermoregulatory devices (polyethylene bags and thermal mattress).Outcomes were analyzed and compared using a pre/postdesign. The data was collected using the neonatal intensive care unit admission worksheet.Although statistical analysis was not significant, clinical significance was illustrated by a decrease in hypothermia rates on admission and at 1 hour of life. There was a 100% compliance rate with increasing delivery room/operating room temperatures and thermal mattress use. Polyethylene bag use compliance was 50%.Golden Hour protocols have proven to be an effective tool. Thermoregulation is a significant component of these protocols, and it is imperative that every step is taken to manage the environmental temperature during the birth and admission process.There is a need for continued research on the impacts of thermoregulatory devices and protocols, with resulting practice and device recommendations.",

    "abstract": "As an integral member of a healthcare team, neonatal nurse practitioners (NNPs) provide care in a variety of settings that include but are not limited to all levels of inpatient care, transport, acute and chronic care settings; delivery rooms; and outpatient care settings. Anecdotal evidence indicates that responsibilities, practice environment, and workload vary widely between regions and practice settings.Historically, the supply of neonatal nurse practitioners has rarely met the demand for services, although needs vary by region at any given time. Because the NNP role is a collaborative one, a shortage of NNPs leaves a gap in the team approach to care. In 2011, the National Association of Neonatal Nurse Practitioners (NANNP) commissioned the first national study of the current NNP workforce in the United States and Canada. In an effort to further explore the NNP workforce population, the NANNP Council partnered with the National Certification Corporation to perform a second workforce survey of NNPs in the spring of 2014.The online survey was conducted between March and April 2014. The goal of the study was to describe the demographics, practice environment, scope of responsibilities, benefits and reimbursement, and job satisfaction for the current NNP workforce.Key areas of concern identified by the 2014 Neonatal Nurse Practitioner Workforce Survey include an aging workforce; the need for NNP faculty; inadequate staffing ratios; the lack of downtime during prolonged shifts; and the need to assisting practices in developing competency and mentoring programs.",

    "abstract": "Parents of infants hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) frequently need guidance to prepare them for the care and health promotion of their child after hospital discharge. The health literacy of the parents should be considered so that education can be tailored to meet their needs. It is also important to understand the parents' preferences for how, and from whom, they receive education.The purpose of this study was to identify health literacy levels of parents of infants in an NICU and preferences for who they want to provide them with education.An exploratory, descriptive design was used to assess participant health literacy and preferences for obtaining child health information. Only mothers (no fathers) with babies in the NICU were available to complete the survey. Mean participant age was 26.4 years (SD = 6.7).Participants had a mean Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine, Revised, score of 5.64 (SD = 2.4), indicating a low level of health literacy. Questions regarding when to administer medication were correctly answered by 69% of participants. Proper medication dosage was understood by 92% of participants; however, only 30% were able to correctly convert measurements. One-on-one discussions with a physician were the preferred source of health information for 80% of participants.The current exploratory study provides new information that will help inform the development of future studies and increase awareness of nurses regarding health literacy and the specific types of skills for which parents need the most help.",

    "abstract": "Background: Preterm infants generally spend weeks in the neonatal intensive care unit where light intensity can fluctuate as well as be high, leading to physiological instability and increased motor activity in these infants. To date, 2 lighting control methods have been studied: cycled lighting and continuous near darkness. The most appropriate method of lighting is still unknown due to ambivalent results from the studies that have assessed these 2 interventions. Objective: To compare the effects of cycled lighting versus continuous near darkness on physiological stability and motor activity level in preterm infants born between 28 and 32 weeks of gestation. Methods: A randomized clinical trial was conducted to compare physiological stability and motor activity level in preterm infants assigned to cycled lighting or continuous near darkness. Thirty-eight participants were recruited and randomly assigned to one of the lighting conditions for 24 hours. Physiological stability was measured using the Stability of the Cardiorespiratory System in Premature Infants (SCRIP) score, the means, and the coefficient of variation of each physiological parameter measured. The level of motor activity was measured with an accelerometer. Results: There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with regard to physiological stability measured by the SCRIP score, means, and coefficient of variation as well as motor activity level. Participants in both groups were physiologically stable and their motor activity level was comparable. Implications for Practice and Research: Neither cycled lighting nor continuous near darkness negatively impacted infant's physiologic stability and motor activity level. Further research is required to identify the most appropriate lighting control method for preterm infants born between 28 and 32 weeks of gestation.",

Purpose: The aim of this scoping review is to identify risk factors associated with feeding problems that persist beyond infancy in children (aged 1-6 years) who were born preterm (&lt;37 weeks' gestation). Methods: To perform this scoping review, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses framework was applied. To be included in this study, articles had to be published in peer-reviewed journals, had an empirical study design, examined feeding problems relating to the child's feeding ability or refusal to eat certain texture of foods, and assessed risk factors (age, weight, and medical conditions) associated with long-term feeding problems in children who were born preterm. Results: After abstract and full-text screening, a total of 9 articles meeting the inclusion criteria were included in this study. Findings from this study identified that gestational age and birth weight are significant risk factors and that sex, duration of mechanical ventilation, and length of tube feedings are potential risk factors. Implications for Practice: This study confirms that younger and smaller infants are at a high risk of encountering oral feeding difficulties and early interventions services should be focused on these preterm infants. Implications for Research: Evaluation of timing and intensity (dose) of early interventions strategies should be investigated to provide more targeted and effective interventions for younger and smaller preterm infants.",

    "abstract": "Background: Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are used routinely in neonatal care. Measures of surface anatomy have been used to estimate appropriate PICC depth in neonates since 1973. However, prior PICC research using anthropometric measures to estimate proper PICC insertion depth has been limited to pediatric and adult literature. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore the relationships among a neonate's anthropometric measures and the appropriate PICC insertion depth. Methods: Neonates requiring PICC insertion at Nationwide Children's Hospital were enrolled between January and September 2018. Standard PICC procedures were followed. The research group corroborated appropriate PICC tip position of enrolled infants. Multivariable linear regression with robust standard errors was used to evaluate linear relationships between PICC insertion depth and current weight, current length, and PICC insertion site. Results: Demographics of enrolled infants included gestational ages of 23 to 39 weeks, weights of 510 to 3870 g, and lengths of 31 to 54 cm. Of the 56 infants considered, final statistical analysis included 49 neonates (14 ankle, 16 knee, and 19 antecubital insertions). Current neonatal weight was associated with PICC depth at all sites (all P s &lt; .0001). Current neonatal length was associated with PICC depth at all sites (all P s &lt; .0001). Preprocedure surface measurement was also strongly associated with PICC insertion depth ( P &lt; .0001). Implications for Practice: This investigation demonstrated a relationship for both neonatal weight and length that may be an anthropometric model for neonatal PICC insertion depth. Implications for Research: A more robust sample size could more precisely define the anthropometric model.",

Purpose: To identify US prevalence of FCC practices and resources and to identify the largest gaps in resource provision. Methods: Neonatal nurses completed an online survey through national conferences (eg, NANN educational conference), neonatal organization Web sites (eg, NANN research survey), and social media (eg, NANN and NPA Facebook). Nurses provided demographics and the National Perinatal Association Self-Assessment on Comprehensive Family Support, a 61-item checklist of FCC practices and resources from 6 categories: family-centered developmental care, staff education/support, peer support, palliative care, discharge education, and mental health support. Results: Nurses (n = 103) reported lowest resources for Peer Support and Mental Health Support. About a third had a neonatal intensive care unit parent advisory committee (n = 39; 37.9%). Only 43.7% (n = 45) had necessary amenities for families to stay with their infants. Less than a third felt that mental health professionals were adequately staffed to provide counseling to parents (n = 28; 27.5%). Very few nurses had adequate training on providing parents psychological support (n = 16; 15.8%). More than half (n = 58; 56.3%) stated that all staff receive training in family-centered developmental care. Finally, less than half (n = 42; 40.8%) stated that staff see parents as equal members of the care team. Implications for Practice: We demonstrate a consistent and widespread lack of training provided to neonatal staff in nearly every aspect of comprehensive FCC support. Implications for Research: Researchers need to identify unit/organizational interventions that increase adoption and implementation of FCC practices and resources.",

The initial search produced 905 articles of which 8 met the eligibility criteria.Data extraction and analysis were guided by Noblit and Hare's (1988) meta-ethnography approach. The analysis process was completed by a team of researchers, inclusive of breastfeeding experts.Five overarching themes emerged including trustworthy information; early postpartum support by key influencers; maternal culture; tangible resources, and Black mothers' empowerment.Social support is a major determinant for the initiation and continuation of breastfeeding among African American women in the United States. Future longitudinal studies are warranted to explore the social support of breastfeeding among African American women in the United States.",

Purpose: To compare 3 methods of determining gastric tube insertion length in infants in the NICU. Methods: In this randomized triple-blind clinical trial, 179 infants admitted to the NICU were randomized to have their gastric tube insertion length determined by 1 of 3 methods: (1) the nose, earlobe, mid-umbilicus (NEMU) method, (2) a weight-based method, or (3) an age-related height-based (ARHB) method. Positioning of the gastric tube was verified by radiograph. R software was used for analyses. To compare categorical variables, Fisher's exact test, χ 2 tests, and simulated χ 2 tests were used. Results: Overall, infants had a mean gestational age of 35 weeks, 115 (58.8%) were male, and the mean birth weight was 2481.5 g. Upon radiological assessment, 145 gastric tubes (81.3%) were correctly positioned in the gastric body or greater curvature of the stomach with the weight-based method having the highest percentage of correctly positioned gastric tubes (n = 53; 36.6%), followed by the ARHB method (n = 47; 32.4%) and the NEMU method (n = 45; 31.0%). No significant differences were identified between groups ( P = .128). Implication for Practice and Research: Despite the NEMU method being the most commonly used method in clinical practice, the weight-based and ARHB methods to determine gastric tube insertion length may be more accurate.",

The aim was to address the prolonged hospitalization of infants and exposure to medications to treat NAS.The goal was to determine whether the eat, sleep, console (ESC) method decreases the length of stay (LOS) and morphine usage when compared with the Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring System (FNASS).The inclusion criteria were 36 weeks' or longer gestation and exposure to opiates in utero. The FNASS method was replaced by the ESC method with a refocus on nonpharmacologic care. Data were collected for 6 months during implementation of the ESC method and compared with the 6 months prior to implementation.The results of the project include: the average LOS decreased from 25.9 days to 13.7 days, a 47% reduction; the rate of scheduled morphine initiation decreased from 58% to 7%, an 88% reduction; as-needed morphine initiation decreased from 33% to 7%, a 79% reduction; and the rate of adjunctive medication initiation decreased from 17% to 0%, a 100% reduction.The outcomes of LOS and rate of morphine usage were significantly improved when using the ESC method when compared with the FNASS at this facility. The results support future implications including expanding the ESC program to the well newborn population at this facility and other similar units.

The purpose of this study was to test the effect of SSC on physiologic responses in I-VLBW infants. Specific variables of interest include central/peripheral temperature difference, fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2), and oxygen saturation. SUBJECTS Fourteen I-VLBW infants participated in the study and completed the protocol. DESIGN/METHODS An experimental, interrupted time series crossover design was used with infants randomly assigned to treatment order, intermittent SSC (treatment) versus incubator care (control). Data collection was facilitated by a computer data acquisition system. Data were analyzed by using repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance. RESULTS Infants weighed 990 ± 155 g and had a corrected gestational age of 30 ± 1 weeks. Mean central/peripheral temperature difference decreased from a baseline of 0.86°C (±0.4°) to 0.36°C (± 0.3°) during the first hour of SSC (P = .002) and to 0.12°C (± 0.3°) during the second hour of SSC (P = .01). Mean FIO2 increased during SSC (mean FIO2 = 45% = 8.6%) compared with incubator care (mean FIO2 = 36% ± 8.8%) (P = .009). Oxygen saturation was lower during SSC, but this finding was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS Intubated VLBW infants did not show stability of these physiologic variables during SSC and were more stable during the incubator phase (control). Data demonstrating physiologic stability during SSC are necessary before SSC are routinely adopted for the I-VLBW infant.",

    "abstract": "In the past 50 years, only 7 studies evaluating demand feedings in preterm infants have been published. The studies employed a variety of research methods including nonexperimental, quasi-experimental, and experimental designs. The earliest demand feeding studies are difficult to interpret due to inadequate sample sizes and incomplete descriptions of methodology. Trials in the 1980s and early 1990s were better described; however, they suffered from designs that produced findings that likely were strongly related to unit, nurse, or infant-specific interactions with the treatment, making it unlikely that findings could be replicated in other settings. The most recent studies are better conceived and described. Overall, the pattern of findings across the past 50 years indicates that preterm infants who were fed on demand showed some clinical improvement when compared to those infants offered other feeding patterns. Demand-fed infants exhibited more hunger cues and had improved behavior state organization, shorter duration of hospitalization, and gained weight at the same rate or faster than infants not fed on demand. Although each of the studies reviewed had some methodologic weaknesses, the consistency of findings across differing researchers, settings, empirical indicators, and years supports the cautious contention that demand feeding might prove to be the feeding approach of choice for most healthy preterm infants. Further studies in this area are warranted to add to current knowledge regarding the safety and efficacy of feeding various preterm infant populations. Research to address subpopulation differences (i.e., infants with congenital heart disease or orofacial lesions) in timing, method, and approaches to preterm infant feeding care is also needed.",

The pathophysiology and disease state of sepsis appear to be similar between adults and children. Both groups display symptoms that indicate a systemic inflammatory response leading to coagulopathy, hypotension, inadequate perfusion of peripheral tissues and organs, and, ultimately, organ failure and death. By presenting a comparison of adult and neonatal pathophysiology, as well as a supporting literature review and clinical evidence, this article links the pathways of inflammation, activation of coagulation, and impaired fibrinolysis, known as the sepsis cascade, to neonatal sepsis. Knowledge of the pathophysiology has important clinical and research implications. Unlike traditional antimicrobial therapy, new potential therapies, currently under investigation for the treatment of sepsis, target the cellular response rather than the invading organism. A more complete understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis may also lead to diagnostic tools with improved sensitivity and specificity for early recognition and treatment.",

The effects of fatigue, due to long work hours, working at night, and insufficient sleep, are often underestimated. This article reviews basic information about fatigue and sleep and includes examples drawn from data provided by 6 NICU nurses who participated in a recent study to highlight the relationship between fatigue and error. These case studies reinforce the concept that NICU nurses need to be alert enough to provide safe care for their patients, as well as alert enough to detect and correct the errors made by others. Employing good sleep habits, minimizing shift rotations and excessive work hours, and using strategic naps can reduce the adverse effects of fatigue that could potentially put patients, especially the most vulnerable ones, at risk.",

    "abstract": "Free radical production occurs continuously in all cells as a by-product of cell metabolism. In tandem, the human body has developed endogenous antioxidant systems as well as taken advantage of dietary exogenous antioxidants to process and detoxify free radicals appropriately. However, certain conditions may increase free radical production beyond the body's endogenous and exogenous antioxidant systems. The neonatal period is a vulnerable time for free radical damage and injury, particularly for preterm infants whose antioxidant defense systems have not fully matured. Endogenous and passively acquired exogenous antioxidant defense systems do not accelerate in maturation until late in the third trimester. To explore the complexities of these concepts, this article includes a description, an evolutionary perspective of oxygen, and a basic background on free radical chemistry in biology. In addition, this chemistry is applied to the etiology of many of the most common diseases seen in the neonatal period. Finally, the current research addressing clinical strategies in this area is critically appraised. Implications for practice and directions for further research are presented with an emphasis on strategies that support the prudent use of oxygen therapies.",

SUBJECTS One hundred fifty-two mothers of 165 infants who were admitted to the NICU. DESIGN Descriptive longitudinal study that was part of a larger project that investigated changes in family function during the first year after the birth of an infant requiring neonatal intensive care. METHODS Mothers were asked to complete the study questionnaires at 3, 6, and 12 months after the infants' discharge from the NICU. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Maternal health status (1 question from the Short Form-12 Health Survey); health service utilization of mothers and their infants (components of the Health and Social Service Utilization Questionnaire adapted for postpartum women and their newborn infants); and mother's report of infant's health problems and infant's re-hospitalization(s) (form developed for current study). PRINCIPAL RESULTS The majority of mothers described their current health to be excellent or very good (73%, 64%, and 73%, at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively). Approximately half of the mothers indicated that their infants had a variety of health problems during each of the 3 time periods after NICU discharge. Use of health services was reported by the largest proportion of mothers in the 3 months after discharge, with physicians being the most heavily used group at each of the 3 time periods (72%, 36%, and 45% at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively). According to maternal report, few infants were readmitted to hospital at any time period (14%, 6%, and 10% at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Few mothers of high-risk infants in the current study reported poor health. About half of the sample reported their infants to have health problems during the first year of life. Mothers reported use of more health services during the first 3 months following their child's discharge than during the latter part of the first year. Mothers also reported using more health services for their infants in this time period compared with the later time periods. By maternal report, few infants were rehospitalized in any time period.",

DESIGN A pilot randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. SUBJECTS Two groups of 10 infants were enrolled and randomly assigned to treatment or nontreatment groups. Gestational age was less than 29 weeks. Demographic descriptions of the 2 groups were statistically similar. METHODS The observer and staff were blinded to assignment; the TT practitioner was blinded to observed measurements. Each infant received either TT or no therapeutic touch (NTT) for 5 minutes on 3 consecutive days at the same time of day, behind a curtain. Heart period variability (HPV) was measured 5 minutes before, during, and after the treatment phase. RESULTS Examination of the parameters of oxygen saturation and episodes of apnea demonstrated no increase in adverse events in TT group compared with NTT group. Repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance on HPV revealed differences in the interaction of group assignment with low-frequency, high-frequency, and low-to-high- frequency ratio interaction (F2,143 = 8.076, P = .000) and for group, day, and low-frequency, high-frequency, and low-to-high-frequency ratio (F2,288 = 3.146, P = .015), and in the posttreatment time period (F1,16 = 6.259, P = .024), reflective of greater parasympathetic activity in TT group. CONCLUSION In this pilot trial, HPV showed an increase for the TT group compared with the NTT group. The study reveals no adverse effects of TT in preterm infants.",

At birth, CK had a grossly distended abdomen, prominent abdominal veins, hepatomegaly, bounding femoral pulses, and generalized edema. Initial imaging identified an absent ductus venosus, absent segment of the inferior vena cava (IVC), and prominent superior vena cava to the right atrium. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed a mass contiguous with the liver causing compression of the IVC. Biopsy confirmed infantile myofibromatosis (IM), an uncommon soft tissue neoplasm that may present at birth or in early infancy. Although rare, this neoplasm is the most common fibrous tumor of infancy. The case of CK was unusual because the solitary IM lesion was in an atypical location; a solitary lesion is not commonly found in the viscera, and solitary lesions are predominant in males. Although lesions are often benign, visceral involvement is associated with high mortality. The cause is unknown, although familial cases have been reported. This article describes the key features of IM, possible treatment options, nursing care, and prognosis for infants with the disease.",

Delivering care in units of this size that incorporates the principles of family-centered care and that is satisfying to both staff and parents is challenging. One proposed method to enhance delivery of care in the megaunit NICU has been to implement a clinical microsystem approach. Up to now, research to evaluate the efficacy of a clinical microsystem has focused primarily on staff satisfaction and perception. However, implementing the clinical microsystem within the NICU requires that careful attention be paid to the parents and their experience and perception of their infant's care in the NICU. This article reviews the basic principles of familycentered care, identifies components of care that affect parents' satisfaction with NICU care, reviews the theoretical underpinnings of the clinical microsystem, and discusses areas for future research.",

Quiet time is a strategy implemented in neonatal units to promote the sleeping of neonates by reducing noise levels, luminosity, and handling during particular periods of the day. Purpose: To determine the impact of quiet time on reducing sound levels and increasing total sleep time. Methods: This longitudinal study was conducted at a neonatal intermediate care unit with a convenience sample of 12 premature infants. Four times per day, 60-minute quiet times were provided in the neonatal unit. Sleep-awake states and sound levels were evaluated during quiet times as well as 60 minutes before and afterward. Polysomnography was used for sleep-awake state assessment, and a noise dosimeter was used to check sound levels every 24 hours. Results: The preterm infants had a corrected gestational age of 35.0 ± 1.5 weeks and weighed 1606.0 ± 317.8 g. Total sleep time was highest during quiet time ( P = .005). Premature infants remained awake for longer following quiet times ( P = .005). There was also a reduction in sound level during quiet times compared with the other time frames ( P = .006). No statistically significant relationship was found between total sleep time and sound levels more than 24 hours. Implications for Practice: Quiet time is a nursing intervention that should be implemented in all neonatal units. Implications for Research: Future research should use a greater sample size and other factors that influence sleep should be further investigated.",

While many unimodal and multimodal sensorimotor interventions have been generated to optimize oral feeding skills, there has been little cohesion between interventions. Purpose: The aims of this systematic review were to examine the effect of sensorimotor interventions on oral feeding outcomes and to determine whether multimodal interventions lead to better oral feeding performances than unimodal interventions. Search Strategy: A systematic search of CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO databases was conducted. Studies were reviewed to assess the types of interventions used to improve transition to full oral feeding, volume intake, weight gain, and length of hospital stay. Results: The search identified 35 articles. Twenty-six studies examined a unimodal intervention, with the majority focusing on oral sensorimotor input and the others on tactile, auditory, and olfactory input. Nine studies assessed multimodal interventions, with the combination of tactile and kinesthetic stimulation being most common. Results varied across studies due to large differences in methodology, and caution is warranted when interpreting results across studies. The heterogeneity in the studies made it difficult to make any firm conclusions about the effects of sensorimotor interventions on feeding outcomes. Overall, evidence on whether multimodal approaches can lead to better oral feeding outcomes than a unimodal approach was insufficient. Implications for Practice: The use of sensorimotor interventions to optimize feeding outcomes in preterm infants varies based on methods used and modalities. These factors warrant caution by clinicians who use sensorimotor interventions in the neonatal intensive care unit. Implications for Research: Large randomized clinical trials using a standardized approach for the administration of sensorimotor input are needed to further establish the effects on feeding outcomes in preterm infants.",

Mothers could not take milk-enhancing or milk-reducing substances, feed directly at the breast, have had breast surgery, or use any other breast pump during the study.Nonexperimental, descriptive study.Mothers were instructed to use the Ameda Platinum breast pump exclusively 8 times daily, for 14 days. They recorded milk volumes, suction pressures, cycle speeds, and time spent pumping. A \"Performance Questionnaire\" was completed at the end of the study with questions about the ease of use, preferred speed and suction settings, and overall performance of the pump.Full milk production was defined as 700 mL/d. Speed and suction settings, as well as average pumping session length, were analyzed in relation to categories of maximum milk volumes expressed.The average maximum daily milk volume for all mothers was 817 mL/d. Sixteen mothers produced milk volumes more than 700 mL/d and 9 of these mothers were able to express more than 1000 mL/d. Those with daily milk production more than 700 mL/d used lower suction pressure settings to stimulate the milk ejection reflex and to empty the breast. These higher-producing mothers also chose ending speeds of 50 to 60 cycles per minute, similar to the nutritive sucking pattern of a healthy newborn. Mothers producing less than 500 mL/d used higher suction pressures, faster ending cycle speeds, and longer pumping times. Suction pressures varied widely among all of the mothers and were influenced by the mothers' nipple or breast sensitivity, which varied from mother to mother and day to day. Mothers reported liking separate controls for speed and suction and used them to achieve maximum comfort and milk volume.The Ameda Platinum breast pump is an effective hospital-grade pump for exclusively pumping mothers to establish full milk production by 14 days postpartum. Separate control of speed and suction allows mothers a wide range of options to achieve greater comfort and multiple milk ejections, both of which contribute to optimal milk expression.",

The committee felt that to implement the proposed FCC projects someone would need to devote full attention to the task. The parent-to-parent (PTP) position was created to develop and sustain initiatives of our institution's NICU Family Support Program. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to describe the process of creating a PTP manager position and the effects it can have in the NICU for the family. Program outcomes were assessed in 3 areas that align with core principles of FCC: (1) emotional support and parent empowerment, (2) a welcoming environment with supportive policies, and (3) education for staff and families. The assessment of the program included review and attendance of parent support offerings, review and revision of parent material, and survey evaluation of staff education. Findings/Results: In the first year, the program reached over 800 families, provided 136 parent education hours, and organized social activities that reached 847 families. Implications for Practice: The creation of a PTP manager position has been instrumental in the development and management of multiple initiatives to offer families and staff continued support and education. Implications for Research: Further evaluation of programs and strategies for PTP support in the NICU setting is needed.",

    "abstract": "Neonatal pain management guidelines have been released; however, there is insufficient systematic institutional support for the adoption of evidence-based pain management in Japan.To evaluate the impact of a collaborative quality improvement program on the implementation of pain management improvements in Japanese neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).Seven Japanese level III NICUs participated in a neonatal pain management quality improvement program based on an Institute for Healthcare Improvement collaborative model. The NICUs developed evidence-based practice points for pain management and implemented these over a 12-month period. Changes were introduced through a series of Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles, and throughout the process, pain management quality indicators were tracked as performance measures. Jonckheere's trend test and the Cochran-Armitage test for trend were used to examine the changes in quality indicator implementations over time (baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months).Baseline pain management data from the 7 sites revealed substantial opportunities for improvement of pain management, and testing changes in the NICU setting resulted in measurable improvements in pain management. During the intervention phase, all participating sites introduced new pain assessment tools, and all sites developed electronic medical record forms to capture pain score, interventions, and infant responses to interventions.The use of collaborative quality improvement techniques played a key role in improving pain management in the NICUs.Collaborative improvement programs provide an attractive strategy for solving evidence-practice gaps in the NICU setting.",

    "abstract": "Background: The unique communication challenges faced by parents of infants undergoing therapeutic hypothermia have not been well characterized. Purpose: To develop awareness of communication challenges experienced by families of infants treated with therapeutic hypothermia. Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted in a group setting with parents matched into groups according to the severity of the infant's presenting encephalopathy. The interviews were transcribed and coded into principal and additional subthemes. Results: Thirty adults were interviewed including 15 mothers, 12 fathers, 2 grandmothers, and 1 grandfather. The 15 infants were between 2 and 24 months of age at the time of the interviews. The principal theme of communication included the following 3 subthemes; transparency, consistency, and delivery style. Parents reported a strong desire for improved early and transparent communication about therapeutic hypothermia, particularly during transfer from an outside hospital. Parents also reported a preference for consistent communication and highlighted parental touch of the hypothermic infant, obstetrical nurse-to-neonatal intensive care unit nurse communication, and parent and visitor presence in the infant's room as areas in need of greater communication consistency. Parents valued direct and compassionate communication styles that excluded medical jargon. Implications for Practice: All providers can implement recommendations for communication to parents of infants treated with therapeutic hypothermia by increasing transparency, developing greater consistency in the communication delivered, and employing a direct and compassionate style to improve the parental experience of therapeutic hypothermia. Implications for Research: Further investigation is needed into the specific challenges parents face with a lack of transparent communication prior to the transfer of an infant for therapeutic hypothermia.",

    "abstract": "Background: Premature birth affects opportunities for interaction between infants and mothers. Skin-to-skin contact (SSC) is standard care in neonatal care but has not been sufficiently studied regarding the effects on interaction between preterm infant and mothers. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare interaction between preterm infants and their mothers after continuous versus intermittent SSC from birth to discharge. A secondary aim was to study a potential dose–response effect between time in SSC and quality of interaction. Methods: Families were randomly assigned to either continuous (n = 17) or intermittent (n = 14) SSC before delivery. Interaction was measured from videotapes of a Still-Face Paradigm collected at 4 months' corrected age. Face-to-face interaction was coded according to Ainsworth's Maternal Sensitivity Scales and the Maternal Sensitivity and Responsivity Scales-R. Dose–response correlations were calculated between mean time spent in SSC and each of the interaction scales. Results: There were no statistically significant differences between groups in maternal interactive behavior toward their infants regarding sensitivity, interference, availability, acceptance, withdrawal, or intrusivity. There was no correlation between mean time in SSC and quality of interaction. Implications for Practice: Continuous SSC from birth to discharge was not superior to intermittent SSC concerning mother–infant interaction between preterm infants and their mothers at 4 months' corrected age. However, compared with other studies, mean time in SSC was also high in the intermittent group. Implications for Research: Further studies are needed to find out how interaction between parents and preterm infants can be improved, supported, and facilitated in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and whether there is an optimal dose for SSC.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: This article explores the differences and similarities in opinions of neonatal intensive care issues between parents, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) healthcare professionals (nurses and physicians), and managers (neonatal unit managers and pediatric division managers). METHOD: An exploratory survey (n = 624) was conducted in Sweden during 2012-2013 on the basis of a validated questionnaire composed of 92 neonatal care-related Likert items. A total of 141 parents, 443 professionals, and 40 managers completed the survey. The parents were recruited consecutively from 5 NICUs of the Västra Götaland region in Sweden and the professionals and managers from all 40 NICUs in Sweden. Data were analyzed with analysis of variances, and post hoc analyses were conducted through pairwise t tests with Bonferroni corrections. RESULT: Professionals and managers differed significantly on 1 item. Parents, however, found 54 items significantly less important than professionals did, but found only 4 to be significantly more important than professionals did. CONCLUSIONS: In line with previous research, we found that a gap exists between views of neonatal intensive care practices, with parents on one side and professionals and managers on the other. The nature of this gap, however, differs substantially from previous research, where parents found many items to be more important than professionals did. To develop and improve neonatal intensive care, this gap must be acknowledged and addressed, both in research and in practice. NICU managers need to develop strategies and routines that allow professionals to understand and adjust to the specific priorities of individual parents and families.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this article was to establish psychometric validity evidence for competency assessment instruments and to evaluate the impact of 2 forms of training on the abilities of clinicians to perform neonatal intubation. To inform the development of assessment instruments, we conducted comprehensive task analyses including each performance domain associated with neonatal intubation. Expert review confirmed content validity. Construct validity was established using the instruments to differentiate between the intubation performance abilities of practitioners (N = 294) with variable experience (novice through expert). Training outcomes were evaluated using a quasi-experimental design to evaluate performance differences between 294 subjects randomly assigned to 1 of 2 training groups. The training intervention followed American Heart Association Pediatric Advanced Life Support and Neonatal Resuscitation Program protocols with hands-on practice using either (1) live feline or (2) simulated feline models. Performance assessment data were captured before and directly following the training. All data were analyzed using analysis of variance with repeated measures and statistical significance set at P < .05. Content validity, reliability, and consistency evidence were established for each assessment instrument. Construct validity for each assessment instrument was supported by significantly higher scores for subjects with greater levels of experience, as compared with those with less experience (P = .000). Overall, subjects performed significantly better in each assessment domain, following the training intervention (P = .000). After controlling for experience level, there were no significant differences among the cognitive, performance, and self-efficacy outcomes between clinicians trained with live animal model or simulator model. Analysis of retention scores showed that simulator trained subjects had significantly higher performance scores after 18 weeks (P = .01) and 52 weeks (P = .001) and cognitive scores after 52 weeks (P = .001). The results of this study demonstrate the feasibility of using valid, reliable assessment instruments to assess clinician competency and self-efficacy in the performance of neonatal intubation. We demonstrated the relative equivalency of live animal and simulation-based models as tools to support acquisition of neonatal intubation skills. Retention of performance abilities was greater for subjects trained using the simulator, likely because it afforded greater opportunity for repeated practice. Outcomes in each assessment area were influenced by the previous intubation experience of participants. This suggests that neonatal intubation training programs could be tailored to the level of provider experience to make efficient use of time and educational resources. Future research focusing on the uses of assessment in the applied clinical environment, as well as identification of optimal training cycles for performance retention, is merited.",

    "abstract": "Health care providers have debated the timing of umbilical cord clamping since the days of Aristotle. Delayed cord clamping was the mainstay of practice until about the 1950s when it was changed to immediate clamping on the basis of a series of blood volume studies combined with the introduction of active management of the third stage of labor. However, in recent years, several systematic reviews advise that delayed cord clamping should be used in all births for at least 30 to 60 seconds.The purpose of this article is to discuss the physiology of umbilical cord clamping, the potential benefits and adverse effects of delayed cord clamping, and how this affects the advanced practice nurse.A search of PubMed, Cochrane Reviews, and Clinical Key was used to find relevant research on the topic of umbilical cord clamping.Potential benefits of delayed cord clamping include decreased frequency of iron-deficiency anemia in the first year of life with improved neurodevelopmental outcomes in term infants, reduced need for blood transfusions, possible autologous transfusion of stem cells, and a decreased incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage. Apprehension exists regarding the feasibility of the practice as well as the potential hindrance of immediate resuscitation.There is a need to begin to look for populations for which delayed cord clamping can be implemented.Recommendations are inconsistent on the patient population and timing; therefore, further studies are needed to understand the multiple variables that affect timing of umbilical cord clamping.",

Factors such as changes in resident duty hours, increasing neonatal intensive care unit admissions, and a shortage of NNPs contribute to NNP workload. Increased workload has been shown to be detrimental to providers and can affect quality of care. Purpose: This study quantified NNP workload using a subjective workload metric, the NASA Task Load Index, and a newly developed objective workload metric specific to NNP practice. Methods: The NNP group at a level IV academic medical center was studied. The sample included 22 NNPs and 47 workload experiences. Results: A comparison of scores from the NASA Task Load Index and objective workload metric showed a moderate correlation ( r = 0.503). Mental demand workload scores had the highest contribution to workload. Feelings of frustration also contributed to workload. Implications for Practice: The NASA Task Load Index can be utilized to measure the workload of NNPs. The objective workload metric has potential to quantify NNP workload pending further validation studies and is a simple, straightforward tool. Implications for Research: Additional research is needed regarding NNP workload and methods to quantify workload. Larger studies are needed to validate the objective workload metric.",

No research has assessed neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) nurse experience in providing care to hypothermic babies and emotional support to their parents.To assess NICU nurse attitudes to the provision of TH with respect to perceptions about baby pain/sedation, need for nurse and parent education, decision making about initiation of TH, and barriers to best care.A survey was electronically sent to 219 nurses at 2 affiliated academic level III NICUs: 1 rural and 1 urban location. There were 17 questions where responses were selected from a preset list and 7 opportunities for nurses to provide free text responses.The response rate was 38% (N = 83). Overwhelming similarities between the urban and rural institutions were found with NICU nurses expressing understanding of the indications for initiating TH, agreement that TH improves long-term outcomes and that the benefits of TH outweigh the risks. Nurses at the urban institution more frequently expressed concerns surrounding inadequate treatment of baby pain/sedation, and nurses at both institutions strongly emphasized the need for more nurse and parent education about TH and improved timeliness of decision making for initiation of TH.NICU nurses specifically want to learn more about outcomes of babies after treatment with TH and feel that parents need more education about TH.Research is urgently needed to better understand the implications of TH treatment for parent-baby bonding.",

Opportunities to create parenting experiences with transitional objects exist following the infant's death.This article offers suggestions for staff in units where infant loss is possible to best assist parents in optimal grieving through the offering of transitional bereavement objects.CINAHL Complete, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched using the following key words-perinatal bereavement, grief, perinatal loss, transitional objects, bereavement photography-and the search was limited to 5 years and the English language.Recommendations exist and are well supported by leading neonatal and perinatal nursing and medicine organizations for the use of transitional objects to facilitate healthy grieving when parents experience perinatal loss. Transitional objects are mementos that validate the meaning of parenthood-even if the physical act of parenting was brief. Nursing and medical staff have significant roles in guiding parents to a healthy state of bereavement and ultimately managing long-term grief.Transitional objects can be provided by staff that are low-cost or free, such as taking photographs for parents, or they can involve purchased products from perinatal bereavement programs. In the latter case, funding needs are a consideration for budgeting decisions.Immediately following a loss, parents experience a brief sense of healing after receiving mementos of their infant. However, further research is needed to assess long-term effects of receiving transitional objects following perinatal loss.",

However, cvEEG is labor-intensive and the need to initiate and interpret studies on a 24-hour basis is a major limitation.This study aims at establishing consistency in monitoring of newborns admitted to 2 different neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) managed by the same neurocritical care team.Neonatal nurses were trained to apply scalp electrodes, troubleshoot technical issues, and identify amplitude-integrated EEG abnormalities. Guidelines, checklists, and visual training modules were developed. A central network system allowed remote access to the cvEEGs by the epileptologist for timely interpretation and feedback. A cohort of 100 infants with moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy before and after the training program was compared.During the study period, 192 cvEEGs were obtained. The time to initiate brain monitoring decreased by 31.5 hours posttraining; this, in turn, led to an increase in electrographic seizure detection (20% before vs 34% after), decrease in seizure clinical misdiagnosis (65% before and 36% after), and reduction in antiseizure medication burden.Training experienced NICU nurses to set up, start, and monitor cvEEGs can decrease the time to initiate cvEEGs, which may lead to better seizure diagnosis and management.Further understanding of practice bundles for best supporting infants at risk and being treated for seizures needs to be evaluated for integration into practice.Video Abstract Available at https://journals.lww.com/advancesinneonatalcare/Pages/videogallery.aspx.",

The project studied 4 main outcomes of interest related to efficiency and effectiveness: increase in parenting confidence, parent learning, knowledge change, and satisfaction. Data were collected from speakers and attendees immediately following educational sessions. Analytical approaches included descriptive statistics such as frequency, percentage, and response rate, and inferential approaches such as t test, χ, and analysis of variance.Findings suggest that the NFS Core Curriculum improved both program efficiency and effectiveness. Sessions fully implemented according to recommended strategies had better outcomes than sessions not fully implemented according to recommended strategies (P < .0001). Across the 3648 attendees at 41 sites, 77% of parents reported learning \"a lot\" at the session they attended and 85% of attendees reported increased confidence. Attendees also reported positive knowledge change and high satisfaction.Parent education best practices identified through this initiative can be utilized for future NFS Core Curriculum topics and potentially generalized to all NICU parent education and family education in other hospital intensive care units.Content and best practices identified through this project will require regular review to ensure medical accuracy and appropriateness of best practices as the physical design of NICUs evolves.",

    "abstract": "Nonimmune hydrops fetalis secondary to congenital chylothorax (CC) is a rare disease process associated with high morbidity and mortality related to abnormal formation of the lymphatic system and disrupted management of fetal fluid. Hydrops fetalis is typically diagnosed prenatally by the presence of pleural effusions or other fluid collection on ultrasonography. Congenital chylothorax is diagnosed when the analysis of pleural fluid is deemed chylous. Neonatal presentation is often respiratory distress secondary to lung compression or pulmonary hypoplasia. Management ranges from supportive medical management such as high-frequency ventilation, chest drainage, and nutrition support, to controversial therapies such as octreotide administration and chemical pleurodesis, to surgical interventions such as thoracic duct ligation and mechanical pleurodesis.To discuss a range of management techniques and supportive therapies for hydrops fetalis and CC.PubMed and CINAHL were searched using the terms \"hydrops fetalis,\" \"congenital,\" \"chylothorax,\" \"neonate,\" and \"preterm.\" Twenty-two English language articles published within the last five years were identified and included to determine the current body of evidence surrounding treatment options for hydrops fetalis and CC.In this case, a preterm male infant presented at birth with prenatally known bilateral pleural effusions and ascites, later diagnosed as nonimmune hydrops fetalis secondary to CC. A combination of supportive medical management, octreotide therapy, and surgical intervention effectively resolved this infant's chylothorax and hydrops.Antenatal intervention may be appropriate for some infants, otherwise supportive medical management including respiratory and nutrition therapies should be prioritized for infants born with hydrops fetalis and CC.Nonimmune hydrops fetalis secondary to CC presents a complex challenge for neonatal providers, as no definitive treatment strategy currently exists. Further research is needed to determine the safety and efficacy of controversial therapies including octreotide.",

Cell phone use by both family and staff introduce unwanted bacteria into the NICU environment, thereby becoming a threat to this high-risk population.A quality improvement initiative to evaluate and improve the cleanliness of cell phones used in the NICU.A convenience sample of 18 NICU parents and staff. The participants' cell phones were sampled for bacteria pre- and postcleaning with disinfectant wipes and sent to the microbiology laboratory for a 2-day incubation period. In addition, each participant completed a survey on cell phone cleaning habits.Microbial surface contamination was evident on every phone tested before disinfecting. All phones were substantially less contaminated after disinfection.A standardized cleaning process with a surface disinfectant reduced the amount of germs and potential transmission of nosocomial pathogens within the NICU. The simple exercise illustrated the importance of cell phone hygiene in a high-risk population. The implementation of a simple cleaning process has been an easy and effective way to rid unwanted organisms from this high-risk population.Further research evaluating transmission of nosocomial infections from cell phones would enhance the evidence to establish hospital policies on cleaning devices.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Research concludes that there is a need for educational programs for grandmothers, as well as networking opportunities; educational programs for other extended family members have long been sought by parents, relatives, and nurses in neonatal intensive care unit. PURPOSE: To describe the effect of having premature infants' extended families participating in family-centered care (FCC) groups in the neonatal intensive care unit. An intervention based on dialogue, including topics as own reactions, general knowledge about the premature infants, parenthood, and how the extended families can support the new families during hospitalization and after discharge. METHODS: A qualitative content analysis of 2 focus group interviews involving 16 purposefully sampled extended family members, who had participated in 1½ hours of FCC group interventions. FINDINGS: The overall theme was: Accepting the individuality of the infant and providing the family with realistic expectations for the future. This theme emerged during the analysis of 4 categories: knowledge sharing, same basis for understanding, access to the immediate family, and competent supporting role. The interrelationship between the categories also emerged, surprisingly, during the analysis. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Extended family members should be recognized as an essential part of the new family's life from the time of the premature infant's admission to neonatal intensive care unit. Family-centered care group interventions should be integrated into ward practice and policy. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: The study reinforces the need for further research, utilizing both qualitative and quantitative methods, into age and ethnicity aspects of FCC group interventions. There is also a need to compare the new parents' perceived level of stress and support from the FCC group intervention in relation to participating and nonparticipating extended families.",

    "abstract": "Background: Neonatal sepsis is a leading cause of morbidity and early-life mortality worldwide, and previous data have reported the highest neonatal mortality rate in Pakistan. Purpose: The present study aimed to decipher the prevalence of group B Streptococcus (GBS)–associated sepsis, coinfections, and antibiotic susceptibility of isolated microbes in neonates. Methods: Blood samples of 100 cases of neonatal sepsis were subcultured on blood agar, GBS agar, and MacConkey agar for isolation of GBS and suspected microbes. Results: Of 100 neonatal blood samples, 85 blood samples were culture-positive, including mixed culture growth (n = 18), 25 samples as early-onset neonatal sepsis (EONS) and 60 as late-onset neonatal sepsis (LONS). Staphylococcus aureus showed high percent positivity (31.4%), followed by Candida sp (16.5%), GBS (14.1%), Klebsiella (14.1%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (11.8%), Pseudomonas (9.4%), Acinetobacter (9.4%), Esherichia coli (8.2%), and Enterococcus (5.9%). GBS was isolated more frequently from EONS than from LONS with 50% coinfections. Mode of delivery, gender, and respiratory distress in neonates were significantly associated with culture-positive sepsis. GBS isolates were highly (91.7%) susceptible to vancomycin, cefotaxime, and chloramphenicol, followed by penicillin (83.3%), ampicillin, and tetracycline (75%). GBS isolates were resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, and linezolid. Implications for Practice: Our findings evidenced GBS-associated risk factors and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of neonatal sepsis, which will help clinicians in management, control, and treatment of neonatal sepsis. Implications for Research: The epidemiological evidence of GBS-associated neonatal sepsis, demographic characteristics, risk factor data analysis, and drug resistance pattern has disease prevention implications in neonates in low-income countries including Pakistan.",

Half of the NNPs (51%) report high satisfaction with their scope of practice and role in their organization. Distribution of NNPs throughout the workforce is suboptimal, with 67% of the administrators indicating they do not have enough NNPs.The 2020 NANNP workforce survey collected information on NNP compensation, benefits, work environment, and experiences. It identified areas of satisfaction, such as compensation with bonuses and pay increases, and acknowledged areas needing improvement such as the lack of diversity within the profession.

The Neonatal Resuscitation Program® (NRP®) is the training and education standard in the United States for healthcare professionals who manage newborns in the hospital. This article summarizes the development of evidence-based resuscitation science, changes in the NRP 8 th edition educational methodologies, and several significant practice changes made for educational efficiency and patient safety. Evidence Acquisition: The NRP 8 th edition is informed by multiple systematic reviews of emerging science conducted by the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR), which culminates in consensus documents on resuscitation science. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Heart Association (AHA) used these recommendations to develop the most recent neonatal resuscitation guidelines for North America. These guidelines inform the NRP 8 th edition practice recommendations. Results: The most recent CoSTR (Consensus on Science with Treatment Recommendations) summary and AAP/AHA guidelines for neonatal resuscitation yielded no major changes in practice. However, scientific research over the past 5 years resulted in new and higher grades of evidence to support previous recommendations. The NRP Steering Committee revised several practices in the interest of patient safety and educational efficiency. Implications for Practice: The NRP 8 th edition materials were released in June 2021 and must be in use by January 1, 2022. In the new ILCOR evidence review format, CoSTR scientific reviews and statements are published continuously instead of every 5 years; however, future editions of NRP will be released every 5 years unless there is compelling evidence that mandates an earlier change.",

A comparative effectiveness study design was used to evaluate the ESC model.The ESC model impacted care and outcomes for infants with NAS, contributing to a significant reduction in morphine treatment, decrease in LOS among morphine-treated infants, increase in weight loss in infants who did not require morphine treatment, less NICU use, and greater Pediatric Unit utilization. A nonsignificant increase was found in the number of infants who consumed their mother's own milk by any feeding method in the 24-hour period prior to discharge.Results may be helpful for hospitals striving to optimize care for infants exposed to opioids, using assessments of eating, sleeping, and consoling to guide individualized treatment decisions and to reduce morphine use.",

Purpose: To test the Premature Infant Oral Motor Intervention (PIOMI) on the development of oral–motor function, feeding, and anthropometric outcomes using sucking manometry. Methods: A single-blind randomized experimental design was conducted with a sample of 60 preterm infants from 2 neonatal intensive care units between May 2019 and March 2020. The experimental group received PIOMI for 5 min/d for 14 consecutive days.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND The pacifier, a non-nutritive sucking device, is commonly used for calming infants. The World Health Organization/United Nation's Children's Fund (WHO/UNICEF) Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative recommends avoiding pacifiers in breastfed term infants because it is thought to lead to early weaning. Most studies that found early weaning to be associated with pacifier use were observational in design. This Critically Appraised Topic evaluates a randomized controlled trial that examines pacifiers and early weaning. PURPOSE The objectives of the study analyzed were to test whether regular pacifier use has a causal effect on early weaning from the breast by 3 months of age and to assess the difference in results when the data are examined using randomized intervention allocation (intention to treat) versus observational use of pacifiers. METHODS Two hundred eighty-one breastfeeding women and their healthy term infants were allocated randomly to 1 of 2 counseling interventions. Both groups received basic breastfeeding promotion information. In addition, the experimental group mothers (n = 140) were asked to avoid pacifiers and were given other alternatives for comforting a crying infant. Logs detailing infant crying, fussing, and pacifier use were completed at 4, 6, and 9 weeks of age, and an interview at 3 months determined the duration of breastfeeding. RESULTS The experimental group had a higher rate of total avoidance of pacifier use (38.6% v 16% in the control group) and less daily use of pacifiers (40.8% v 55.7%). When the data were analyzed based on the intention to treat (randomized allocation), the experimental intervention group had similar rates of early weaning as the control group (18.9% v 18.3%). When the data were analyzed on the treatment given (ignoring randomization), a strong observational association was found between daily exposure to pacifiers and weaning by 3 months (25% v 12.9% of exposed versus unexposed groups). CONCLUSION The results imply that pacifier use may be a marker of breastfeeding difficulties or decreased maternal motivation to breastfeed, as opposed to being the causal agent in early weaning.",

Those with high-risk neonatal histories, family history of childhood hearing loss, and hyperbilirubinemia are at greatest risk. Current neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) hearing screening methods that rely only on otoacoustic emissions will fail to detect this disorder. Auditory neuropathy differs from conductive hearing loss and sensorineural hearing loss; a specific constellation of findings on audiologic evaluation are diagnostic of this disorder. The pathophysiology of AN is unclear; however, it may be caused by demyelinization or degeneration at points along the auditory pathway. The actual incidence of AN is unknown; it is more prevalent in high-risk infants. The course of AN varies widely among patients. Current management ranges from close monitoring of the child's development to cochlear implantation. Neonatal intensive care unit nurses need to be aware of this disorder to help support and educate at-risk families and to alert them of the need to monitor hearing and language development in their infants.",

SUBJECTS Thirty-three mothers of infants born weighing less than 1500 g. DESIGN A single-group, pretest—posttest design was used. METHODS Preintervention mothers completed self-report questionnaires and their interaction with their infant was observed. Mothers then received the intervention program. Mothers were assessed twice postintervention, first when the infant was 11/2 months old and again at 6 months. At the postintervention assessments, mothers completed the same questionnaires and interaction was observed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Mothers completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the revised Parental Stress Scale: Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, the NICU Parental Beliefs Scale, and the Perinatal PTSD Questionnaire. Interactions between mothers and infants were rated by trained research staff using the Index of Parental Behaviour in the NICU. Postintervention mothers also responded to a questionnaire that assessed their perceptions of the intervention program. RESULTS It was feasible to enroll mothers because 62% of eligible mothers agreed to participate. However, 39% of mothers who enrolled withdrew. Most of the mothers who withdrew did so before even beginning the intervention, and many of these women were mothers of multiples. It was also feasible to provide the intervention because more than 80% of mothers who began the intervention received all 6 teaching sessions. Mothers found both the content and the format of the program to be acceptable. There were nonetheless several challenges in conducting an intervention study with mothers early in the NICU hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS The results of this pilot study are encouraging. It was found to be both feasible and acceptable to provide the intervention program to mothers during the NICU hospitalization. The effectiveness of this program needs to be assessed in a randomized controlled trial.",

SUBJECTS Sixty-eight healthcare professionals who were employed in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) on a full-time or part-time basis and had received an educational session regarding the PIPP. DESIGN AND METHODS A pilot study using an exploratory descriptive design was used to answer: (1) How satisfied are healthcare professionals with the computer-based teaching module? and (2) What is the feasibility of a computer-based teaching module in the clinical setting? Satisfaction was measured using an investigator-developed 5-point Likert scale. Feasibility was measured in terms of time to complete the module, satisfaction with instructions and ability to navigate through the module, acceptability of the module as a teaching method, and format with the computer-based module. PRINCIPAL RESULTS Ninety percent of those sampled were very satisfied with the computer-based teaching method. Use of video and audio clips and photographs enhanced the learning process. Healthcare professionals identified the computer-based teaching method as an effective way of learning about the PIPP and thought that it was feasible to use within the clinical setting. CONCLUSIONS Computer-based teaching is a feasible method for educating NICU healthcare professionals about the PIPP. Additional research is required to examine the effectiveness of this teaching method on relevant patient outcomes such as pain management.",

Meconium testing is considered a potentially useful newborn screening method. Screening for alcohol (and other drug) use is unique from all other types of newborn screening in that there is a greater element of social risk for parents, particularly mothers (public exposure of substance use with potential for child welfare involvement). There are many factors related to the science and ethics of the meconium screening process to consider before implementing universal or targeted screening. As care providers who participate in the screening and counseling process and as advocates for infants and their families, neonatal nurses should be active participants in discussions surrounding the ethical and clinical appropriateness of meconium screening program development and expansion. The science behind meconium screening at present is not strong enough to warrant widespread implementation of screening; neonatal nurses are cautioned to approach screening carefully because of the critical social implications for mother and baby.",

Sample Forty-four 24-hour decibel recordings were obtained in one of eight randomly selected four-bed pods. In addition, a single 1-hour recording was obtained in four different models of vacant incubators. Main Outcome Variable Ambient sound levels. Results Decibel levels were analyzed to identify changes in noise levels following alterations in the NICU environment. Installation of motion-sensing motorized paper towel holders significantly increased levels at beds closest to the towel dispensers, as did the trial of a new communication system. Decibel levels in four different incubators revealed varying noise levels.

There were no human subjects.Twenty-four samples of 8 oz of DHM were divided into four 60-mL aliquots. Timed feedings were given by Medfusion 2001 syringe pumps with syringes connected to narrow-lumened extension sets designed for enteral feedings and connected to standard silastic enteral feeding tubes. Gravity feedings were given using the identical syringes connected to the same silastic feeding tubes. All aliquots were analyzed with the York Dairy Analyzer. Univariate repeated-measures analyses of variance were used for the omnibus testing for overall differences between the feeding methods. Lipid content expressed as grams per deciliter at the end of each feeding method was compared with the prefed control samples using the Dunnett's test. The Tukey correction was used for other pairwise multiple comparisons.The univariate repeated-measures analysis of variance conducted to test for overall differences between feeding methods showed a significant difference between the methods (F = 58.57, df = 3, 69, P < .0001). Post hoc analysis using the Dunnett's approach revealed that there was a significant difference in fat content between the control sample and the 1-hour and 2-hours feeding methods (P < .0001), but we did not find any significant difference in fat content between the control and the gravity feeding methods (P = .3296). Pairwise comparison using the Tukey correction revealed a significant difference between both gravity and 1-hour feeding methods (P < .0001), and gravity and 2-hour feeding method (P < .0001). There was no significant difference in lipid content between the 1-hour and 2-hour feeding methods (P = .2729).Unlike gravity feedings, the timed feedings resulted in a statistically significant loss of fat as compared with their controls.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To design, implement, and to evaluate the outcomes of an evidence-based practice change regarding the use of heparin in intravenous (IV) locks to improve patient safety. Phase I of the project examined dwell time, hours of patency, gestational age at birth and at time of IV lock insertion, birthweight and weight at time of insertion, and reason for discontinuation for IV access devices prior to and following the practice change from heparinized saline (HS) to normal saline (NS) flush. Phase II of the project was to determine the effect of the educational program on staff knowledge of the use of heparinized saline vs normal saline flushes. SUBJECTS: The setting was an 18 bed level III NICU located in the northeastern United States. A sample of 70 infants with IV locks were included in the study; HS (n = 34) and NS (n = 36) respectively. Infants with IV's that were converted to IV locks were excluded. Only professional NICU staff (n = 40) were recruited for the educational offering. DESIGN: A comparative descriptive design with two components was utilized. METHODS: A retrospective and prospective chart review was used to compare the outcomes of neonates with IV locks flushed with heparin and normal saline flush and evaluated the outcomes. A pretest/posttest design was used to analyze the change of the NICU staff's knowledge concerning heparin flush before and after an educational offering. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: IV lock patency after practice change to NS flush and the change of the NICU staff's knowledge concerning heparin flush after an educational offering. PRINCIPAL RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference in IV catheter patency with NS flushed catheters averaging 13 hours longer than HS flushed catheters (p = 0.02). Also a statistically significant increase in mean scores was noted for the NICU staff posttest after the educational offering (p = .0001). There was a 20% increase in knowledge scores. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this project support the current literature base suggesting that the use of heparin is unnecessary for the maintenance of IV access devices. Unnecessary exposure of neonates to heparin increases risk to patient safety and should therefore be avoided. Future research should examine the use of heparin in central lines in neonates. Findings additionally support educating staff prior to practice changes.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To devise and test an instrument measuring clinician perceptions of perinatal palliative care (PPC) and barriers to care delivery. THEORY: PPC was theorized to involve the care of pregnant women and their families after prenatal testing resulted in a life-limiting fetal diagnosis. Both giving birth to a child with a life-limiting condition or termination of pregnancy for fetal anomaly can be emotionally traumatic life events. Clinicians were thought to face ethical dilemmas that involved approaches to care for this population. The ethical dilemmas were measured on a perceptions scale using items about informed consent, justice, beneficence, and autonomy. Barriers were theorized as obstacles to delivering quality PPC and included insufficient education, personal discomfort, and difficulty garnering team or administrative support for care. SUBJECTS: Licensed clinicians practicing in the perinatal field. DESIGN: Stage 1 entailed instrument development and validation, which was achieved through a Delphi study involving 11 expert panelists. The devised instrument included 64 six-point Likert items. In stage 2, a computer survey gathered data from a multidisciplinary, clinician group. METHODS: A total of 264 clinicians completed the survey. Exploratory factor analysis with varimax rotation was used to validate the instrument, evaluate the factors, and summarize the explained variance achieved by sum scores of the perceptions and barriers scales. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The perceptions scale was reduced to 23 items with a 6-factor solution explaining 67% of the variance with a good internal consistency reliability of 0.77 (Cronbach α). The 22-item barriers scale had a 6-factor solution explaining 71% of the variance with an alpha reliability of 0.83. PRINCIPLE RESULTS: The Perinatal Palliative Care Perceptions and Practice Barriers Scale instrument© is a valid and reliable measure of PPC perceptions and barriers for measuring the attitudes of physicians and nurses. CONCLUSION: Use of this instrument can foster educational programs and hospital planning for PPC teams that provide grieving families with the varied support they need. It is also a useful instrument for examining trends in the clinician perspectives and practice barriers as more genetic testing and subsequent terminal diagnoses occur.",

Recent studies report that approximately 25% to 35% of very low-birth-weight infants less than 1500 g receiving packed red blood cell transfusions develop temporally associated NEC, known as transfusion-related NEC (TR-NEC). Although there are many known risk factors for NEC, this article focuses on 3 contributing factors: packed red blood cell transfusions, enteral feedings, and gastrointestinal immaturity. Previous data suggest that these factors may interact to affect neonatal intestinal tissue oxygenation, which may lead to tissue ischemia, resulting in intestinal injury. This article presents a conceptual framework that combines current theoretical perspectives for TR-NEC, and reviews previous research examining related variables and how their interaction may increase the risk for TR-NEC development. In addition, incorporation of the proposed framework to guide future research and nursing care in this area is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Despite recommendations from the World Health Organization, the United Nations Children's Fund, the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Breastfeeding, and others, only a small percentage of infants in the United States receive exclusive human milk for the first 6 months of life. In the United States, decisions related to infant feeding are determined by surrogate or proxy in place of the neonatal voice, using the “best interest principle” as the guiding ethical focus. Given the established research on the benefits of an exclusive human milk diet compared with artificial nutrition (infant formula), infant feeding decisions made for the critically ill neonate should rest entirely in the infant's best interest, not solely in parental authority. If the mother's own milk is not available or its use is contraindicated, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends donor human milk.1 However, the preverbal voice of the neonate makes it difficult to isolate the best interest of the infant separated from the family unit. Using a case exemplar, it is proposed that the means in which infant feeding decisions are made for the critically ill infant should rest entirely in the infant's best interest, not parental authority, during the course of care in the hospital setting. The best interest principle, surrogate decision making, parental authority, and proxy consent are reviewed. Furthermore, a case for the best interest principle to further illustrate the importance of the infant's voice in relationship to enteral feeding decisions is provided. Finally, implications for clinical practice are offered.",

Initial systemic supportive therapy remains a critical aspect of HIE management. In addition to support therapy, the widespread use of hypothermia has demonstrated a reduction in death and neurodevelopmental disability in infants with moderate to severe HIE. Neonates with HIE born outside of tertiary care centers must be rapidly identified as hypothermia candidates and have emergent transport arranged. While waiting for the transport team to arrive, these neonates often require intensive stabilization, including meticulous temperature management.

    "abstract": "Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is a growing problem in the United States, affecting 32,000 infants annually. Although breastfeeding would benefit infants with NAS, rates among these mothers are low.The purpose of this quality improvement project was to increase breastfeeding rates and decrease hospital length of stay (LOS) for infants with NAS through prenatal breastfeeding initiatives.A pre-/postquality improvement design was used to assess the relationship between breastfeeding initiatives on breastfeeding rates and LOS in infants with NAS. A 3-class curriculum was offered to pregnant women at risk for delivering an infant with NAS. Chart review was completed for all infants evaluated for NAS in a hospital at baseline (n = 56), after Baby Friendly Status (BFS) (n = 75), and after BFS plus breastfeeding education (n = 69).Although not statistically significant, the BFS plus breastfeeding education cohort had the largest percentage of exclusively breastfed infants during hospitalization (24.6%) and at discharge (31.9%). There was a statistically significant decrease in LOS (P < .001) between cohorts.The small sample made it not possible to infer direct impact of the intervention. However, results suggest that prenatal education may contribute to an increase in the numbers of infants with NAS who receive human milk and a decrease in hospital LOS.Refinement of best practices around breastfeeding education and support for mothers at risk of delivering an infant with NAS is recommended so that breastfeeding may have the greatest impact for this subgroup of women and their infants.",

    "abstract": "Adequate pain management of preterm and sick newborn infants is a critical issue in the neonatal intensive care unit, as the infants are small and vulnerable with limited resources to deal with pain and stressful experiences. The use of pain assessment instruments, however, must be applied correctly to achieve consistency and improve continuity in care and treatment among clinicians. To assess the development of neonatal intensive care unit nurses' interrater agreement in using the COMFORTneo pain assessment tool 5 years after initial implementation, and to identify items needing further development through analysis of discrepancies among nurses' COMFORTneo scores. An evaluation study with a pre- and postdesign comparing nurses' interrater reliability in assessing infant pain using the COMFORTneo pain assessment tool at baseline and 5-year follow-up. Eighty-five percent of the nurses in the follow-up group (n = 26) had improved their skills 5 years after the implementation, and the improvement was significant (P < .000). We also found that interrater reliability was satisfactory (κ scores ≥0.65) for all the items of the COMFORTneo tool. However, to obtain \"very good\" interrater reliability (κ scores ≥0.80) 3 items were identified needing increased focus. A thorough implementation of a national clinical guideline has been partially effective in ensuring that nurses used the COMFORTneo in their daily practice, which increased their competence in pain assessment. Further research into the education of nurses on the efficacy of pain scales, nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies, and individualized pain assessment is needed to better address pain management.",

    "abstract": "Background: Preterm infants are at increased risk of developing feeding intolerance and necrotizing enterocolitis. Comprehensive, targeted nursing assessments can evaluate the risk for and identify early signs of these conditions in an effort to prevent their destructive sequela. Purpose: While the long-term goal is to develop a validated risk-scoring tool for the prediction of feeding intolerance and necrotizing enterocolitis, the objective of the preliminary phase presented here is to assess the ease of use and nurses' attitudes toward a novel feeding intolerance and necrotizing enterocolitis risk–scoring tool. Methods: A novel risk-scoring nursing tool was implemented in a University of Illinois–affiliated 48-bed level III neonatal intensive care unit. Data were collected from the electronic medical record of all preterm infants with parental consent during the initial 6-month study period. Scoring accuracy (accuracy of selection of risk factors based on electronic medical record data), ease of use, and nurses' attitudes toward the tool were assessed at the study site and by evaluators at a national neonatal nursing conference. Results: Fourteen nurses scored 166 tools on the 63 enrolled infants. Sixteen tools (9.6%) contained errors. Mean study site tool ease of use was 8.1 (SD: 2.2) on a 10-point scale. Ninety percent of conference evaluators agreed/strongly agreed that the tool addressed important knowledge gaps. Implications for Practice: The tool is easy to use and valued by nurses. Following validation, widespread implementation is expected to be a clinically feasible means to improve infant clinical outcomes for minimal time and financial cost. Implications for Research: Tool validation and refinement based on nursing feedback will improve its broad applicability and predictive utility.",

    "abstract": "Initiating early enteral intake post-surgical gastroschisis repair may result in better patient outcomes. However, there is lack of evidence and consistency in clinical practice regarding the timing of initiation of feedings, and few studies have determined best practices for post-operative nutritional management.To determine whether early nutritional management using a standardized advancement protocol improves outcomes for patients with gastroschisis.A retrospective study was used, following the implementation of a new early enteral feeding protocol. Patients managed without the new protocol, from January 2007 through December 2009, formed the traditional feeding group, while those receiving post-protocol nutritional management, from January 2010 through December 2012, comprised the early enteral feeding group. The main outcome, measured by length of stay (LOS), and secondary outcomes, including incidence of sepsis, were evaluated; N = 32. There was a statistically significant difference in the scores for LOS (P = .022) and incidence of sepsis (P = .36). No correlation was found between the number of days to initial feeding and LOS (P = .732). However, there was a robust, positive correlation between the number of days to achieve full feedings and LOS (P < .001) IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: These findings support the benefit of early initiation of enteral feedings in reducing the incidence of sepsis. Furthermore, they suggest the time to achieve full enteral feedings, not necessarily the timing of initiation of feedings, significantly impacts LOS.Consideration for future studies include incorporating strategies that combine early enteral feeding initiatives with interventions that allow for quicker onset of full enteral intake.",

    "abstract": "The National Association of Neonatal Nurse Practitioners (NANNP) conducted its second workforce survey of certified neonatal nurse practitioners in the fall of 2016. National Association of Neonatal Nurse Practitioners partnered with the National Certification Corporation and the American Association of Nurse Practitioners to conduct this electronic survey, containing 69 questions and focusing on practice sites and total compensation packages (including benefits) and workforce deficits.Findings indicate a rising neonatal nurse practitioners (NNPs) position vacancy rate across the country. Regional salary data indicated that the southeast had lower compensation rates for NNPs, with regions 4 and 11 (South) having the lowest rates. A promising trend indicated that new graduate NNPs with a doctorate are earning more. The study findings indicate that tailoring benefit packages to the age and years of experience for the individual NNP may aid in recruiting and retaining NNPs in practice. For experienced NNPs, altered shift lengths (shorter), higher employer matching rates in retirement plans, and less employee cost sharing for health insurance benefits are more appealing strategies.It is critical for NNPs to continually evaluate the profession's workforce data. There are more than 205,000 nurse practitioners practicing in the United States, with neonatal NPs making up approximately 3% of the larger whole. Increased participation in future surveys will assist in creating sustainable solutions to the workforce crisis facing the profession.",

    "abstract": "Background: The multifactorial pathology and broad clinical presentation of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) development in premature infants make prediction of disease onset extremely challenging. Over the past decade, packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions have been temporally linked to the development of NEC in severely anemic preterm infants, although this issue is highly controversial. Purpose: In this case study, we describe events of an extremely low birth-weight infant who developed NEC complicated by pneumoperitoneum after receiving multiple PRBC transfusions. Specifically, we describe mesenteric tissue oxygenation trend changes as measured by continuous near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technology. Methods: As part of a larger prospective, observational investigation, this infant was monitored with NIRS (INVOS 5100C; Medtronic, Boulder, Colorado) before, during, and 48 hours following PRBC transfusions. Results: The infant demonstrated severe, prolonged, and persistent reductions in mesenteric tissue oxygenation following blood transfusions, yet routine physiologic monitoring did not indicate intestinal hypoperfusion or impending NEC onset. Implications for Practice: This report demonstrates the ability of NIRS to capture possible tissue ischemia during early stages of NEC that may help guide bedside therapeutic interventions. Implications for Research: Larger cohort studies to evaluate the ability of NIRS to capture early tissue ischemia are essential to validate the feasibility of adding this technology as a routine clinical bedside tool.

    "abstract": "Background: According to the Healthy People 2020 goals, the sustainability of breastfeeding duration rates within the United States has not been achieved. To increase these rates, it is important that women with breastfeeding difficulties receive the support needed to continue breastfeeding. When supplementation occurs, it is essential that the breastfeeding relationship be preserved. Various methods of supplementation are often recommended including use of the supplemental feeding tube device (SFTD). Purpose: The question guiding this brief is “What evidence exists to support the use of an SFTD as a method of supplementation for breastfed infants?” Search Strategy: The PubMed and CINAHL databases were queried for original research published in English from 1990 through July 2016. Search terms included “supplemental feeding tube,” “breastfeeding,” “term infants,” “premature infants,” “Supplemental Nursing System,” “Lact-aid,” and “supply line.” Findings: Very limited research exists on the use of SFTDs as a method of supplementation for breastfed infants; however, existing research suggests that an SFTD may be useful as a supplementation method for breastfed infants. High-quality research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of using an SFTD for supporting exclusive and all breastfeeding rates. Implications for Practice: Nurses and providers need to be educated and trained in the use of SFTDs as well as all supplemental feeding methods. Information on efficacy and SFTD use should also be included in policies related to breastfeeding and human milk use. Implications for Research: Further research should determine best methods of supplementation for breastfed infants and should examine differences in breastfeeding rates when using the SFTD for supplementation.",

Purpose: This study evaluated clinical feasibility, efficacy, and safety outcomes in preterm infants (&lt;36 weeks' gestational age) who received DCC following a practice change implementation intended to reduce the incidence of IVH. Methods: Infants receiving DCC (45-60 seconds) were compared with a sample of infants receiving immediate umbilical cord clamping (&lt;15 seconds) in a retrospective chart review (N = 354). The primary outcome measure was the prevalence of IVH. Secondary safety outcome measures of 1- and 5-minute Apgar scores, axillary temperature on neonatal intensive care unit admission, and initial 24-hour bilirubin level were also evaluated. Gestational age was examined for its effect on outcomes. Results: Although the small number of infants with IVH precluded the ability to detect statistical significance, our raw data suggest DCC is efficacious in reducing the risk for IVH. For infants 29 or less weeks' gestational age, admission axillary temperature was significantly higher in those who received DCC. No differences were found in 1- and 5-minute Apgar scores, 24-hour bilirubin level, or hematocrit level between the two groups. Infants more than 29 weeks' gestational age who received DCC had significantly higher 1-minute Apgar scores, temperature, and 24-hour bilirubin level. Implications for Practice: Clinicians should advocate for the implementation of DCC as part of the resuscitative process for preterm neonates. Implications for Research: Future studies are needed to evaluate the effect of DCC on other clinical outcomes and to investigate umbilical cord milking as an alternative approach to DCC.",

    "abstract": "Background: Despite the recognized importance of human milk (HM) use, breastfeeding is often discouraged for infants with cleft lip and/or palate because of their anatomical abnormalities. Poor weight gain may require formula for calorie supplementation. Stresses associated with caring for infants with cleft lip/palate may decrease rates of HM provision to these infants. Purpose: This study investigates the experiences of mothers of infants with cleft lip/palate (CL/P) to determine choices and factors associated with providing HM to their infants. Methods: A retrospective telephone survey was administered to a cohort of mothers of infants with CL/P. Results: Fifty mothers agreed to participate in the survey. Most (78%) initiated use of HM for a median duration of 4 months, 32% provided HM for 6 months or more, and 79% exclusively expressed their HM. Poor supply was the most frequent challenge to providing HM and led to cessation in 46% of the mothers. Formula was used to supplement for poor supply or poor infant weight gain in 90% of the mothers. The best predictors of a mother's use of HM were child not in day care, genetic diagnosis, and gestational age at birth. Only 36% of mothers reported individual encouragement to provide HM, and 18% reported they were specifically discouraged from providing HM for their infants. Implications for Practice: Although initiation rates were high, there are opportunities to improve support for mothers to increase duration of HM provision in children with CL/P. Implications for Research: This study establishes a baseline for future prospective studies looking at the impact of active encouragement and provision of lactation support within the cleft team setting.",

Purpose: Considering the need to find a method that does not involve the patient's exposure to radiation, this study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography for verifying gastric tube placement in newborns. Methods: This was a prospective, double-blind, observational study performed in a neonatal intensive care unit, in which 159 infants had gastric intubation using ultrasound examination and radiological imaging, to verify positioning. Results were analyzed in terms of diagnostic accuracy. Results: The tubes were correctly positioned in 157 cases (98.7%), according to radiological images, and in 156 cases (98.1%), according to ultrasound. The sensitivity analysis was 0.98 and the positive predictive value was 0.99. It was not possible to perform a specificity analysis, as there were not enough negative cases in the sample. Implications for Practice: The use of ultrasonography to identify correct positioning of gastric tubes in infants and newborns shows good sensitivity. Implications for Research: It was not possible to evaluate the ultrasonography specificity; further studies with greater samples are probably necessary, so that this objective can be achieved.

Outcomes on neonatal intensive care (NICU) patients with CMN are unknown.The primary aim is to describe the clinical profile, resource use, prevalence, and both in-hospital and postdischarge outcomes of neonates with CMN. The secondary aim is to assess the feasibility of sustaining the use of the neonatal complex care team (NCCT).A retrospective cohort study was conducted after implementing a new model of care for neonates with CMN in the NICU. All neonates born between January 2013 and December 2016 and who met the criteria for CMN and were cared for by the NCCT were included.One hundred forty-seven neonates with a mean (standard deviation) gestational age of 34 (5) weeks were included. The major underlying diagnoses were genetic/chromosomal abnormalities (48%), extreme prematurity (26%), neurological abnormality (12%), and congenital anomalies (11%). Interventions received included mechanical ventilation (69%), parenteral nutrition (68%), and technology dependency at discharge (91%). Mortality was 3% before discharge and 17% after discharge. Postdischarge hospital attendances included emergency department visits (44%) and inpatient admissions (58%), which involved pediatric intensive care unit admissions (26%).Neonates with CMN have multiple comorbidities, high resource needs, significant postdischarge mortality, and rehospitalization rates. These cohorts of NICU patients can be identified early during their NICU course and serve as targets for implementing innovative care models to meet their unique needs.Future studies should explore the feasibility of implementing innovative care models and their potential impact on patient outcomes and cost-effectiveness.",

The prevalence of PU in the neonatal intensive care unit is estimated to be 23%, with 80% of those being related to medical devices, including electroencephalographic (EEG) electrodes. Proposed mechanisms involve prolonged pressure to the electrodes and chemical reactions to conductive agents.The object of this quality improvement project was to reduce PU in neonates during continuous EEG (cEEG) monitoring by 50% within 12 months and 75% within 18 months. A secondary objective was to eliminate electrode-related infections by 12 months. Balancing measures included gestational age at the time of monitoring, integrity of the EEG setup, and cost effectiveness. The process measure was adherence to the skin-monitoring tool kit.A multiple Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle method was used. All neonates monitored with cEEG were included. The monitoring tool kit was used to document the condition of scalp and EEG electrodes before, during, and after cEEG.In the preproject period, 8.5% (9/106) of monitored patients developed PU, and 22.2% (2/9) of those developed infections. During the project period, 3.5% (7/198) of monitored patients developed PU and no infections were observed. During monitoring, 21 patients showed skin irritation, and timely intervention resulted in resolution in more than 90% of the cases and prevented progression into PU. Silver/silver chloride-plated electrodes, when exposed to external heat sources, can cause burns, resembling PU.Intervention at the electrode level together with skin inspection successfully reduces PU in neonates. Silver/silver chloride-plated electrodes should be avoided in neonates.Further research is needed to identify the optimal electrode for neonatal EEG.",

However, concerns for patient safety, interrupted workflow, and parent readiness continued to impede KC in a level IV neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Its current policy did not recommend using more than 1 staff member during patient transfer. In addition, NICU staff and parents lacked skills training and education regarding the feasibility of routine KC. Purpose: A KC pathway was developed and integrated within a multifaceted, champion-based, simulated educational training program for NICU staff and families to promote earlier and more frequent KC by increasing their knowledge and comfort with this practice. Methods: Patient data collected before and after the study determined the frequency, timing, and mode of respiratory support during KC. Pre- and posttest surveys evaluated nurses' knowledge and comfort level with KC. Results: The frequency of KC occurred 2.4 times more after the intervention. The percentage of KC episodes for intubated patients nearly doubled. The posttest survey scores for nursing knowledge and comfort level also markedly improved. Implications for Practice: The KC pathway ameliorated feelings of discomfort by depicting criteria and instructions for safe practice. Multidisciplinary champions were invaluable in assisting the nursing staff with patient transfer during KC. Implications for Research: More dose–response studies are needed to maximize the clinical benefits of KC in developed countries.",

    "abstract": "Background: The University of Virginia neonatal intensive care unit is a 51-bed unit with approximately 600 to 700 admissions per year. Despite evidenced-based clinical care, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and feeding intolerance remained problematic. Purpose: In September 2016, the neonatal intensive care unit implemented an exclusive human milk diet (EHMD) for infants born 1250 g or less with the goal of reducing NEC, feeding intolerance, parenteral nutrition use, and late-onset sepsis. Length of stay, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and retinopathy of prematurity were also evaluated. Methods: A work group developed systems for charging and documenting products used in an EHMD. Outcomes were compared with a control group of similar infants born prior to the availability of the EHMD. Results: Infants who received an EHMD had significantly fewer late-onset sepsis evaluations ( P = .0027) and less BPD ( P = .018). While not statistically significant, less surgical NEC was also demonstrated (4 cases vs 1 case, which was 57% of total NEC cases vs 14.3%) while maintaining desirable weight gain and meeting financial goals. Implications for Practice: A multidisciplinary team that implements financial and documentation systems can provide a sustainable clinical practice that improves patient outcomes. Ongoing evaluations of clinical and financial data provide valuable information to guide future clinical practices related to the EHMD. Implications for Research: Future research on the anti-inflammatory effect of an EHMD is needed to provide direction regarding a potential dose-dependent response for reduced BPD rates and severity. The role of human milk and prevention or mitigation of sepsis is not fully understood, but the reduction of the number of late-onset sepsis evaluations may support the relationship between an EHMD and infection protection. Exploring clinical and financial outcomes for implementing the EHMD in infants born more than 1250 g remains a key area for research.",

    "abstract": "Over the past 2 decades, the prevalence of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) has increased almost 5-fold. Skin-to-skin care (SSC), a method of parent-infant holding, is a recommended nonpharmacologic intervention for managing NAS symptoms. SSC has the potential to reduce withdrawal symptoms while positively influencing parent-infant attachment. Yet, little is known about the SSC experiences of mothers of infants with NAS.The purpose of this study was to explore the SSC experiences of mothers of infants with NAS, including perceived barriers to SSC in the hospital and following discharge home.A qualitative descriptive design was used to obtain new knowledge regarding the experience of SSC of mothers of infants with NAS. Purposive sampling was used to recruit participants eligible for the study. We conducted semistructured individual interviews with postpartum mothers of infants with NAS. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis.Thirteen mothers participated in the study. Four themes emerged from the data analysis: \"a little nerve racking\"; \"she needed me, and I needed her\"; dealing with the \"hard times\"; and \"a piece of my puzzle is missing.\" SSC was described as a conduit for healing and bonding; in addition, several barriers to SSC were reported.These findings highlight the inherent benefits of SSC for infants with NAS and demonstrate the unique challenges of these mother-infant dyads. Critical changes in hospital practices are needed to create an environment supportive of SSC for this patient population. In addition, research regarding implementation of interventions to increase SSC usage in this population is warranted.",

Understanding factors that influence duration of mother's own milk (MOM) receipt may have important clinical implications.To identify variables that significantly affect whether or not preterm infants receive their own mother's milk at discharge.Maternal-infant dyads were eligible for inclusion if the infant was born between August 1, 2010, and July 31, 2015, was born at 32 weeks' gestation or less, or was 1800 g or less (institutional donor milk receipt criteria). Bivariate and multivariable regression analyses were performed.Of 428 observations, 258 (60.3%) received MOM at discharge and 170 (39.7%) did not. Maternal characteristics that were protective for MOM receipt at discharge were non-Hispanic race, married, partner support, more educated, and private insurance. Protective infant characteristics were higher gestational age at birth, higher percentage of MOM feedings, fewer ventilator days, and more days of direct lactation. In multivariable logistic regression, the odds of receiving MOM at discharge significantly (odds ratio = 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.72-2.16; P < .001) increased with the increasing proportion of MOM. Regression analysis showed that gestational age and increased maternal age increased the likelihood of MOM receipt at discharge.Clinicians will understand the significant effects even small increases in milk volume have on duration of MOM receipt at discharge, informing them of the importance of strategies to encourage and improve milk expression.Future research studying critical time periods when mothers are most likely to reduce milk expression may have significant clinical importance.",

    "abstract": "Sleep and ongoing cycling of sleep states are required for neurosensory processing, learning, and brain plasticity. Many aspects of neonatal intensive care environments such as handling for routine and invasive procedures, bright lighting, and noise can create stress, disrupt behavior, and interfere with sleep in prematurely born infants. The study empirically investigated whether a 30-minute observation of infant sleep states and behavior could differentiate an intervention to promote sleep in premature infants with feeding difficulties relative to conventional care (standard positioning, standard crib mattress [SP]). We included an intervention to determine the ability of the method to discriminate treatments and generate a benchmark for future improvements. The intervention, a conformational positioner (CP), is contoured around the infant to provide customized containment and boundaries. To more fully verify the 30-minute observational sleep results, standard polysomnography was conducted simultaneously and sleep outcomes for the 2 modalities were compared.In a randomized crossover clinical trial, 25 infants, 31.5 ± 0.6 weeks' gestational age and 38.4 ± 0.6 weeks at the study, with gastrointestinal conditions or general feeding difficulties used each intervention during an overnight neonatal intensive care unit sleep study.Infant sleep states and behaviors were observed during two 30-minute periods--that is, on the positioner and mattress--using the naturalistic observation of newborn behavior. Two certified developmental care nurses assessed sleep state, self-regulatory, and stress behaviors during 2-minute intervals and summed over 30 minutes. Sleep characteristics from standard polysomnography were measured at the time of behavior observations.Infants on CP spent significantly less time in alert, active awake, or crying states by observation compared with SP. Surgical subjects spent more time awake, active awake, or crying and displayed a higher number of behavior state changes than the nonsurgical infants. The percentage of time in observed deep sleep and quiet sleep was correlated with both percentage sleep efficiency (r = 0.78) and fewer state shifts per hour (r = -0.65) from electroencephalogram (EEG). Sleep efficiency by EEG was greater on CP versus SP.The CP enabled sleep compared with the standard mattress (SP) over 30-minute observation periods. Sleep status from behavioral observation was verified by standard EEG-based sleep techniques. Behavioral observation of sleep states may be a useful strategy for measuring the effectiveness of strategies to facilitate sleep in premature infants. Surgical subjects may benefit from additional interventions to promote sleep.",

A case of nonlethal neonatal Escobar is reported in a 35-week-and-6-day old infant who presented in utero with decreased fetal movement, oligohydramnios, and arthrogryposis. The etiologies from maternal causes were excluded prior to birth. Subsequent workup after birth led to a highly suspected diagnosis of nonlethal Escobar by the geneticist. The diagnosis was confirmed by a positive CHRNG gene sequence analysis after discharge. The infant demonstrated contractures and bilateral hip subluxation but was feeding well and was discharged home with outpatient follow-up. Treatment after discharge has been extensive secondary to difficulties associated with this disease. The clinical presentation of nonlethal Escobar, as well as diagnosis and treatment strategies, is provided with caregiving strategies.",

Adhesive products are essential to secure needed medical devices but can be a significant factor contributing to skin breakdown. Current literature does not offer a definitive answer regarding which products most safely and effectively work to secure needed devices in the high-risk neonatal population. Purpose: To determine which adhesive method is best practice to safely and effectively secure lines/tubes in the high-risk neonate population. Findings/Results: The only main effect that was significant was age group with mean skin scores. Subjects in the younger group (24-28 weeks) had higher skin scores than in the older group (28-34 weeks), validating that younger gestations are at higher risk of breakdown with the use of adhesives. Implications for Practice: The findings did not clearly identify which product was superior to secure tubes and lines, or was the least injurious to skin of the high-risk neonate. Neither a transparent dressing only or transparent dressing over hydrocolloid method clearly demonstrated an advantage in the high-risk, preterm neonate. Anecdotal comments suggested staff preferred the transparent dressing over hydrocolloid method as providing better adhesive while protecting skin integrity. The findings validated that younger gestations are at higher risk of breakdown with the use of adhesives and therefore require close vigilance to maintain skin integrity.",

The Stress Resiliency Profile (SRP) questionnaire was administered to a convenience sample of 48 neonatal bedside nurses. The SRP identifies 3 distinct interpretive styles as constructs of stress resiliency including deficiency focusing (negative thinking), necessitating (managing forced change), and skill recognition. Statistical analysis was used to describe associations between ages, years of experience, and resiliency.Results showed skill recognition to be significantly lower than expected in participants 40 years and older. Also, participants with greater than 5 years of NICU experience revealed low to moderate levels of resiliency.Although skill is critical in nursing, it may not be the key factor in reducing the perception of work-related stress. Implementation of interventions targeting interpretative styles known to enhance resiliency may promote positive coping and quality change management.Baseline resiliency data are necessary to guide unit leaders to manage future challenges found in evolving NICU nurse practice environments. More research is warranted to determine the generalizability of study results as healthcare organizations strive to implement best practices, control costs, and deliver safe, quality care.",

Although the rate of neonatal morbidity and mortality decreases with increasing gestational age, recent research has revealed that there is no threshold age for risk or parental concern.This study examines parental concern about medical and developmental outcomes of their premature infant.Parents of 60 premature infants were surveyed in a follow-up clinic regarding their level of concern about 11 morbidities and their child's gestation-adjusted age; these were compared with the infant's inpatient chart. \"Concern scores\" were tallied and compared across gestational age groups and knowledge of gestation-adjusted age using Chi-square tests of independence.Many parents reported concerns about morbidities that were unsupported by their child's diagnoses. Across parents of extremely, very, and moderate-late preterm children, the mean concern scores were 13.9, 15.7, and 19.7, respectively. Overall, 62% of parents incorrectly reported the gestation-adjusted age of their child. Parents who were correct were significantly more likely to correctly anticipate abnormal developmental patterns (70%) and growth patterns (65%) than those who were incorrect (33% and 31%, respectively).Future research should focus on whether NICU graduate parental stress levels are directly linked to the severity of their child's condition, and how physicians can help decrease NICU graduate parental stress.Parental anxiety regarding all gestational age neonatal intensive care unit infant outcomes can be decreased by a thorough explanation of gestation-adjusted age and a discussion of expected prematurity-related issues.",

Difficulties with feeding require specialized attention, and if not well managed, may prolong the newborn's hospital length of stay. This is particularly true for prenatally opioid exposed (POE) infants. A paucity of literature exists characterizing feeding behaviors of POE infants, yet feeding problems are common. Purpose: The purpose of this integrative review was to synthesize and critically analyze the evidence that characterizes feeding behaviors in full-term, POE infants. Methods/Search Strategy: The electronic databases of CINAHL, PubMed, Scopus, and PsycINFO were used. Inclusion criteria were studies in English, conducted from 1970 to 2019, with participant samples consisting of infants with prenatal opioid exposure, born full-term, and between 38 and 40 weeks of gestation. Based on the inclusion criteria, our search yielded 557 articles. After further screening, only 4 studies met our full inclusion/exclusion criteria. These studies were analyzed for evidence of infant feeding behaviors, including characterization of problematic feeding behavior for POE infants. Findings/Results: Our findings revealed inconsistencies in characterization of feeding behaviors among POE infants. A synthesis of the most common evidence-based behaviors was constructed. Infant feeding behaviors were identified and grouped into 2 major behavior domains: (1) typical feeding behavior and (2) problematic feeding behavior. Implications for Practice and Research: Feeding behaviors related to sucking and behavioral states may be different in POE infants. Further examination of effective assessment methods and the categorization of infant feeding behaviors are warranted for use in the development of evidence-based, targeted intervention.",

Little is known about the context and mechanisms of KC implementation. Purpose: This realist review is to explore what NICU policies tell us about practices to implement KC in the NICU. Methods: Policies were obtained via email, database, and search engines. Criteria were established to review each policy. Data were entered into a database then exported for frequency counts of identified characteristics. Results: Fifty-one policies were reviewed, which revealed inconsistencies in the implementation of KC practices. Inconsistencies include variability in infant postmenstrual ages and weight criteria, infant medical equipment in place during participation, duration and frequency of KC, KC documentation, and ongoing monitoring requirements. Implications for Practice: KC implementation varies widely across NICUs, even with similar infant populations. Exclusion of some infants from receiving KC may decrease the potential beneficial outcomes known to result from KC. Implications for Research: More research to understand KC best practice recommendations and implementation in the NICU is needed. Studies are needed to evaluate the duration and frequency of KC, as well as the benefits to infants and families to optimize KC in the NICU setting.",

Their anxiety can inhibit learning and contribute to poor infant outcomes and increased healthcare utilization after discharge. Quality of the discharge teaching is the strongest predictor of discharge readiness, so NICUs must develop excellent discharge preparation programs.This improvement project enhances NICU discharge preparedness by providing consistent, early discharge teaching using technology as a supplemental resource and raises parental satisfaction with the process.Neonatal intensive care unit staff and former NICU parents developed a task force to create technology-based discharge education content. The content was originally uploaded to an e-book and later transferred to the electronic health record inpatient portal. Families were able to view discharge teaching content at their own convenience and pace and review topics as needed with the NICU staff. Postdischarge follow-up phone calls provided insight into parental reaction to the new education format.Parent satisfaction top-box scores, reflecting the highest rating in the \"Prepared for Discharge\" category of the patient satisfaction survey, improved from a baseline of 47% in 2017 to 70% in 2019. Overwhelmingly, 92% of families highly rated the tablet-based discharge teaching during postdischarge phone calls.A comprehensive, consistent, and early discharge program using technology can lead to more effective and efficient NICU discharge education and improved parent satisfaction.Further studies are needed to generalize hospital-based inpatient portal teaching as an additional resource for parental education in the NICU.",

Likert scale responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Free-text responses were analyzed using thematic analysis. A comparison of results was made between parents receiving and not receiving infant mental health services.Fifty (N = 50) parents completed surveys. Eighty percent of parents stated they wanted more information on KC. Common barriers to KC were reported by parents, such as issues with space/environment. The most frequently reported barrier when asked openly was fear of hurting their infant. Ninety-six percent of parents believed that KC helped their emotional well-being. Parents receiving mental health services reported more fear but results did not reach significance.The frequency with which factors are reported as important to parents may allow a prioritization of barriers to KC, which may help focus quality improvement initiatives. The results of this study underscore the vital role nurses play in supporting KC. Additional attention needs to be given to the mental health of NICU parents and its impact on care practices.",

Routine screening for maternal PPD is recommended at infant primary care well-child visits up to 6 months of age.

Bedside nurses administered the screening tool and used a referral algorithm to determine appropriate follow-up. EPDS scores of 10 or more were considered positive and indicated a need for referral.The overall EPDS screening compliance was 66% with a positive rate of 26%. Nurses followed the referral algorithm appropriately 100% of the time. It was confirmed that 93% of the mothers with positive EPDS screenings sought help from a mental health provider.Routine maternal PPD screening should be implemented in all NICU settings. Postpartum mental health issues should not be the sole responsibility of obstetricians, mental health providers, or maternal primary care providers.",

Compared to the maternal skin-to-skin care (M-SSC), fathers in the P-SSC exhibited no significant differences in salivary oxytocin levels (MD: -0.35 pg/mL; 95% CI: -0.75, 0.05), salivary cortisol levels (MD: 0.25 μg/dL; 95% CI: -0.82, 1.33), or anxiety scores (MD: -0.17; 95% CI: -0.57, 0.22) during the period of SSC. Similarly, there were no significant differences in the salivary cortisol levels (MD: -0.11 μg/dL; 95% CI: -0.05, 0.28) among preterm infants between the 2 groups. However, the crying time was less among full-term infants in the P-SSC group compared with infants in the incubator care or cot care groups.P-SSC had similar effects as M-SSC on stress-related outcomes during and after SSC among fathers and infants in the early stages after birth. We recommend that P-SSC be implemented in the early stages after birth. Further RCTs with a longitudinal design and large samples are needed to better understand the long-term effects of P-SSC on fathers and infants.",

    "abstract": "Background: In the United States, up to one-third of infants with a congenital anomaly require neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) hospitalization. Parents of these infants may have different decision-making priorities, which may be influenced by the timing of the infant's diagnosis. Purpose: (1) To compare the ranked importance of decision-making beliefs for parents of infants who received a prenatal versus postnatal congenital diagnosis and (2) explore how parents describe their decision-making beliefs. Methods: A cross-sectional, sequential mixed-methods pilot design was applied to collect quantitative data using the Good Parent Ranking Exercise and further explore parents' decision-making beliefs through qualitative interviews. Maximum difference scaling/hierarchical Bayes estimation and content analysis were used to analyze the quantitative and qualitative data, respectively. Results: Forty mothers completed the Good Parent Ranking Exercise and 20 mothers completed qualitative interviews. Four of the top 5 ranked parenting beliefs were shared by mothers in the prenatal and postnatal groups. Mothers in the postnatal group ranked “focusing on my child's quality of life” higher. Qualitative interviews revealed that previously identified decision-making beliefs were consistent in this NICU parent population, with 1 additional belief identified. Mixed-methods analysis revealed high concordance between the prenatal and postnatal groups. Implications for Practice: NICU nurses need to know that decision-making beliefs for parents who receive a prenatal versus postnatal congenital diagnosis, while largely similar, may have differences. Implications for Research: Future research should explore decision-making beliefs in demographically diverse parent groups (ie, fathers, partnered vs nonpartnered couples) and effective strategies for promoting NICU parents' decision-making beliefs.",

Purpose: To determine what is known about nonpharmacological developmental care interventions used in the NICU to mitigate procedural pain of infants born under 32 weeks gestation. Search/Strategy: Five electronic databases were searched: Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, Embase and the Cochrane Library. The inclusion criteria were as follows: experimental and nonexperimental studies from all publication years with infants born at less than 32 weeks gestational age; peer-reviewed research articles studying nonpharmacological interventions such as skin-to-skin care, facilitated tucking, nonnutritive sucking, hand hugs, and swaddling; and English language articles. Our search yielded 1435 articles. After the elimination of 736 duplicates, a further 570 were deemed irrelevant based on their abstract/titles. Then, 124 full-text articles were analyzed with our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Findings: Twenty-seven studies were reviewed. Sucrose, facilitated tucking, pacifier, skin-to-skin care, and human milk appeared to lessen pain experienced during heel sticks, suctioning, nasogastric tube insertions, and echocardiograms. All nonpharmacological interventions failed to prove efficacious to adequately manage pain during retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) examinations. Implications for Practice: Evidence review demonstrates that healthcare practitioners should use nonpharmacological measures to help prevent pain from day-to-day procedures in the NICU including heel sticks, nasogastric tube insertions, suctioning, echocardiograms, and subcutaneous injections. Implications for Research: Future research is necessary to better understand and measure how pain is manifested by very small premature infants. Specific research on mitigating the pain of examinations for retinopathy of prematurity is also needed.",

Purpose: To inform the design of educational interventions to improve both patient family and staff IP behaviors, we engaged separate groups of nurses and family members to understand perceptions about the spread of infection and barriers to implementing effective IP strategies. Methods: This was a qualitative study using focus groups to gather data from neonatal nurses and patient family members. Data were triangulated with hospital-wide survey data and analyzed using inductive content analysis. Results: Twelve nurses and 4 patient family members participated. Themes related to communication about IP between staff and family members emerged: stakeholders expressed discomfort with the timing and nature of just-in-time HH education. These communication challenges contributed to stress levels within the neonatal intensive care unit. This finding was reflected in the hospital-wide survey. Implications for Practice and Research: Steps should be taken to improve communication about IP behaviors between patient family members and frontline staff. Reducing nurse burden of providing just-in-time HH reminders to patient family members through increased IP education may decrease stress and facilitate IP behaviors. This has the potential to decrease infection spread and improve patient outcomes. The development of interventions targeting stakeholder communication is therefore warranted, but additional research is needed to understand the timing and process for delivery of the educational material.",

However, the role of neonatal nurse practitioners (NNPs) in the development of POCUS programs is not well described. Purpose: To describe the NNP role in the implementation of a NICU POCUS program and exemplify the potential to expand the professional scope and educational advancement of NNPs. Methods: In 2018, a multidisciplinary team assembled to develop a POCUS program in the NICU at Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital (LPCH). Three NNPs received formal POCUS training in order to provide onsite training, perform and supervise POCUS imaging, and participate in quality assurance sessions. NNPs also assisted with the development of a REDCap database and imaging protocols. Results: The LPCH POCUS NNP providers contributed to the advancement of the profession by practicing to the full scope of their role, providing leadership in program development, research, and education. Incorporating NNPs into the programmatic structure of a POCUS program can be a model for others. With advancing skill set, NNPs can be positioned to be national leaders and educators. Implications for practice and research: NICUs developing POCUS programs can benefit from the integration of NNPs to serve as consistent content experts to expand the number of trained providers while assuring the quality of image capture. POCUS is becoming increasingly essential to the care of newborns. NNPs can play a central role in performing POCUS, participating in quality improvement and research, and educating other NICU providers.",

Clinicians frequently question whether variations represent deformations, that is, an alteration in the shape and contour of a normally formed foot, as opposed to a true structural malformation. Distinguishing between a temporary positional deformity and a more serious structural foot malformation is challenging and requires a clear understanding of the anatomy of the foot, its complex embryologic development, and the impact of environmental and intrauterine factors. This installment of Focus on the Physical provides a systematic framework to identify normal, abnormal, and atypical foot deformities in the newborn period. The current theories of pathogenesis are provided, along with a step-by-step approach to the examination of the foot. A series of clinical photographs illustrate talipes equinovarus, metatarsus adductus, talipes calcaneovalgus, and congenital vertical talus. A discussion of the diagnostic studies used to differentiate these abnormalities is provided, along with a brief overview of treatment options.

DESIGN AND METHODS A before-and-after matched cohort study was conducted during 1996/1997 and 1998/1999 enrolling infants in a Standard Practice (SP) group and CPG group, respectively. Weight-stratified CPG were introduced between these 2 study periods. Data on the first 100 babies who could be matched for birth weight and gestational age were analyzed. Data collection continued until full feedings were established and tolerated for 48 hours or the infant was discharged from the hospital, whichever came first. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE Of the 200 infants in the study (median gestational age 28 weeks), 142 infants attained full feedings. The median time to full feedings was 15 days in both groups, and a paired sample t test showed no significant difference between the 2 groups (P = 0.35). PRINCIPAL RESULTS No statistically significant differences in the age of feeding commencement, number of feeding interruptions, days on total parenteral nutrition, days to regain birth weight, age at discharge, incidence of sepsis, hecrotizing enterocolitis, or use of erythromycin were found. CONCLUSIONS The CPG was a safe alternative to standardize nutritional practices in the NICU. The lack of differences between groups shown in this study is likely related to gut immaturity limiting the infant's response to changes in feeding practices, inconsistent use of the guidelines, confounding factors, the small sample size, or the similarity between SP and the CPG.",

    "abstract": "Hypospadias is a common developmental disorder of the urogenital tract, occurring in approximately 1 in 125 live male births. Defined as an atypical urethral opening anywhere along the shaft of the penis, scrotum, or perineum, hypospadias is often associated with a deficient prepuce and chordee. Hypospadias usually occurs as an isolated defect, but can be part of a recognized syndrome or associated with other genital anomalies. The etiology of nonsyndromic hypospadias is unknown, and is believed to be multifactorial. Recent studies have implicated factors such as familial inheritance, low birth weight, assisted reproductive technology, advanced maternal age, paternal subfertility, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals in the pathogenesis of hypospadias. Infants with hypospadias should not undergo circumcision. Currently, most infants with hypospadias undergo surgical reconstruction between 4 and 8 months of age. Parents of a newborn with hypospadias may be anxious and have many questions about their infant's condition. They should be given the opportunity to speak to a pediatric urologist as early as possible. This article provides a guide to the embryologic origins of hypospadias and a photographic atlas to aid bedside clinicians in identifying the spectrum of hypospadias in the newborn.",

A defect in any of these proteins affects the numerous biochemical functions of the cell. Many genetic disorders are associated with peroxisome defects. Zellweger syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder, is one of the disorders that result from a deficiency in the assembly of the peroxisome. Impaired metabolism results in the accumulation of toxic metabolites and damages developing neural cells. This article provides an overview of peroxisome function and its effect on central nervous system development. It highlights the presentation, clinical features, and nursing care of infants with Zellweger syndrome. A meticulous systematic physical assessment enhances early recognition of the physical features of this disorder. Although magnetic resonance imaging detects polymicrogyria, a manifestation of abnormal neuronal migration that is often associated with Zellweger syndrome, the diagnosis is confirmed biochemically.

A head ultrasound 5 days after diagnosis was consistent with cystic periventricular leukomalacia. The scientific literature does not clearly elucidate differences between bacterial and viral infections in infants. When difficulties arise, it is pertinent to consider a viral etiology for the underlying illness and obtain a detailed maternal and infant history focusing on clinical symptoms, seasonality, geographic location, exposure, and incubation period. Polymerase chain reaction is a rapid and sensitive diagnostic test for the identification of enteroviruses in cerebrospinal fluid, blood, urine, and throat specimens and should be performed as part of the general workup in the evaluation of a febrile infant with sepsis. In retrospect, it may have established an earlier diagnosis of meningitis, consequently preventing the unnecessary use of antibiotics, potentially decreasing the length of hospitalization, and eliminating the need for more detailed investigations to rule out other etiological factors. In addition, treatment with pleconaril may have affected the severity of the encephalitis. This article reviews the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and differential diagnoses of enteroviral infections, specifically focusing on the prevention, treatment, and prognosis of the disease and the implications for clinical practice.",

Scoliosis is congenital when associated with abnormal vertebral segmentation regardless of the age of diagnosis. Other conditions may predispose neonates to vertebral damage or the development of sustained uneven forces on the developing spine. Although it is difficult to know which newborns will progress to developing scoliosis, it is important to be aware of risk factors to provide anticipatory education for parents and to arrange appropriate follow-up after discharge. This article reviews the embryology of vertebral formation and risk factors for the development of scoliosis. The discussion includes the incidence, risk factors, genetics, associated problems, physical examination, and nursing implications of the infant with congenital scoliosis.",

SUBJECTS Thirteen healthy premature infants comprised the convenience sample enrolled 1 to 3 weeks prior to discharge. DESIGN A quasi-experimental design was used with the dependent variable being the interface pressures obtained under the occiput and the independent variables as the bed surfaces. METHODS Order of bed surfaces was randomized and standardization of the infant positioning and measuring procedure maintained. Measurements were made between the infant's occiput and the bed surface and interface pressures recorded in millimeters of mercury. The 5 bed surfaces were standard crib mattress with or without foam, gel donut, gel mattress, and water pillow. MEASURES Interface pressure measurements were obtained using the Mini-Texas Interface Pressure Evaluator (Mini-TIPE, Tee-Kay Applied Technology, Inc, Stafford, Texas). RESULTS A 1-way blocked analysis of variance was conducted to evaluate the relationship between the mattress surfaces and the interface pressure measurements. A significant difference in the mean of the interface pressures among the 5 mattress bed surfaces was determined, F4,46 = 33.267, P < .001, with the lowest being the foam overlay. The standard crib mattress had the highest interface pressure that exceeded 100 mm Hg. Post hoc comparisons showed a significant difference between the standard crib mattress with and without foam and the other surfaces. CONCLUSIONS Interface pressure is an important consideration when choosing a support surface for premature infants susceptible to tissue compromise and head molding. Variations in interface pressures between neonatal bed surfaces are apparent. Comparison studies of interface pressures using these and other neonatal bed surfaces will be valuable in determining appropriate products for both premature and neonatal populations with lengthy intensive care stays.",

    "abstract": "PROBLEM Neonatal and pediatric nurses and physicians care for newborn children who have been saved by technological support but who then spend extremely long periods of time in the hospital, perhaps never being able to be discharged to home. There has been little research identifying newborns who are too sick to be discharged from the health care setting and rare reports of staff or parental response to these long-term hospitalizations. PURPOSE This study provides both the numerical data and description of acutely, chronically ill newborn children whose illnesses caused hospitalizations for greater than 6-months (179 days) in the US. METHODOLOGY Method triangulation using a national data set (HCUPKID 2003), a researcher created LONGTERM survey, and a qualitative question was used to identify pathologies associated with newborn length of stays greater than 6 months. Neonatal nurses and physicians provided descriptions of children spending at least 6 months in the hospital, including anecdotal reports of caring for those children. RESULTS The national H-CUP data set identified 680 infants staying 6 months or longer in the hospital during 2003. Four hundred and twentytwo providers submitted LONGTERM surveys describing these infants, with 228 first hand reports on how it felt to care for children with hospital stays between 6 months and 6 years. Extreme prematurity, respiratory distress and necrotizing enterocolitis contributed to the extremely long hospital stays. Nurse and physician participants felt that extremely long hospital stays were often due to situations in which parents or colleagues were insisting upon continued futile treatment.",

In this study, we describe current nursing practices for warming breast milk and examine preterm infants' physiological responses to varying milk temperatures. SUBJECTS AND DESIGN: Randomly selected experienced neonatal nurses (n = 61) were observed as they prepared and administered breast milk gavage feedings. METHODS: We measured the temperature of water baths and breast milk at the beginning and end of the warming period. Physiological responses of the 33 preterm infants cared for by the nurses were observed before feedings and at 5 minutes and 30 minutes after the start of feedings. Gastric residuals were measured 3 hours after the feeds. RESULTS: Water bath temperatures ranged from 23.3°C to 45.5°C at the start of warming and from 23.8°C to 38.4°C when milk was removed. Refrigerated milk was 3.8°C to 27.1°C and warmed to 21.8°C to 36.2°C at feeding time. Warming times ranged from 133 to 3061 seconds. Infant axillary temperatures increased at 5 and 30 minutes into the feedings (P < .05), while heart rate, respirations, and oxygen saturation showed no significant changes. CONCLUSIONS: Further research is needed to clearly define the risks and benefits of warming infant feedings.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe the parent's self-reported confidence as a caregiver. The specific research questions were as follows: What is the parent's perceived level of confidence when performing infant caregiving activities in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)? What is the parent's projected level of confidence about performing infant caregiving activities on the first day at home? SUBJECTS: Participants were parents of infants with an anticipated discharge date within 5 days. Inclusion criteria were as follows: parent at least 18 years of age, infant's discharge destination is home with the parent, parent will have primary responsibility for the infant after discharge, and the infant's length of stay in the NICU was a minimum of 10 days. DESIGN/METHOD: Descriptive, survey research. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants perceived themselves to be confident in all but 2 caregiving activities when caring for their infants in the NICU, but parents projected a change in their level of confidence in their ability to independently complete infant care activities at home. PRINCIPAL RESULTS: When comparing the self-reported level of confidence in the NICU and the projected level of confidence at home, the levels of confidence decreased for 5 items, increased for 8 items, and remained unchanged for 2 items. All of the items with a decrease in score were the items with the lowest score when performed in the NICU. All of these low-scoring items are caregiving activities that are unique to the post-NICU status of the infant. Interestingly, the parent's projected level of confidence increased for the 8 items focused on handling and interacting with the infant. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this research provide evidence that nurses may need to rethink when parents become active participants in their infant's medical-based caregiving activities.",

    "abstract": "Supplemental oxygen plays a critical role in the care of infants born at the lower limits of viability, but not without the risk of morbidity resulting from high levels or prolonged exposure. PURPOSE: The purpose of this quality improvement project was to reduce exposure to hyperoxia as evidenced by SpO2 values within the established target range (88%-92%) among very preterm infants (VPIs) in a level 3 neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Reducing exposure to hyperoxia in this population of exquisitely vulnerable infants has been associated with reduced morbidity, including retinopathy of prematurity, chronic lung disease, and brain injury. SUBJECTS: Two populations of interest were identified: VPIs receiving supplemental oxygen and NICU clinicians. DESIGN: Interventions were employed to (1) improve knowledge regarding hyperoxia and associated outcome sequelae in an interdisciplinary sample of clinicians (pretest posttest design) and (2) reinforce content of the educational intervention by triggering caregiver behaviors to reduce time the VPIs is above target SpO2 range while receiving supplemental oxygen (cohort design). METHODS: Retrospective chart review, baseline clinician knowledge assessment, education, posteducation assessment, collaborative rounds with regular feedback citing time VPIs spent above target oxygen saturation levels (SpO2), and evaluation of impact on time infants spent above target SpO2 range aligned with the project purpose. OUTCOME MEASURES: Pre- and postintervention dependent variables included clinician knowledge of hyperoxia and related evidence as measured by a 24-item multiple-choice Knowledge Assessment Tool before and after attending an educational presentation. Time VPIs were exposed to hyperoxia was evaluated using SpO2 readings and calculating the percentage of time readings were above target range before and after the introduction of educational and behavioral interventions. PRINCIPAL RESULTS: Outcome 1 was to increase knowledge about hyperoxia among clinician caregivers. Paired-samples t test showed a significant difference between preintervention and postintervention Knowledge Assessment Tool scores (P = .000). Outcome 2 measured reduction in time spent with SpO2 readings above target range. An independent-samples t test was used to compare outcomes in preintervention and postintervention VPI cohorts. Mean time spent with SpO2 greater than target range increased in the postintervention cohort, reaching statistical significance with P = .047. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge acquisition on the subject of hyperoxia in VPIs was achieved. Decreasing the percent time VPIs were exposed to hyperoxia was not attained. The postintervention VPI cohort spent more time above the target saturation range despite greater knowledge among clinicians.",

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a potential noninvasive measure of physiologic stress that may be useful for evaluating efficacy of feeding interventions.To evaluate whether HRV is a sensitive measure of physiologic stress compared with standard physiologic outcomes in the context of a feeding intervention study.This was a secondary analysis of a within-subjects, cross-over design study comparing usual care feeding with a gentle, coregulated (CoReg) feeding approach in 14 infants born less than 35 weeks' postmenstrual age. HRV indices were calculated from electrocardiogram data and compared with standard physiologic outcomes, including oxygen saturation (Spo2), respiratory rate (RR), apnea, heart rate (HR), and bradycardia. Data were analyzed using linear mixed modeling.Infants fed using the CoReg approach had fewer apneic events and higher RR, suggesting they were able to breathe more during feeding. No statistically significant differences were found in SpO2, HR, bradycardia, or high frequency power (the most commonly reported measure of HRV). Infants fed using the usual care approach had significantly higher SD12, a measure of HRV indicating randomness in the HR, which is a potential indicator of elevated stress.SD12 was more sensitive to stress than SpO2, HR, and bradycardia. The utility of HRV as a measure of feeding outcomes in clinical practice needs further exploration.Further exploration of HRV as an intervention outcome measure is needed, particularly evaluating nonlinear indices, such as SD12.",

It is a tumor that originates in the connective fibrous tissue found at the ends of long bones and then spreads to other surrounding soft tissues. These lesions are typically large, grow rapidly, and can often be mistaken for teratomas. Diagnosis is confirmed by pathology, where cellular proliferation of fibroblasts occurs. Imaging is an important part of the diagnosis, which includes the use of magnetic resonance imaging and/or computed tomography scan. Although surgical resection is the primary treatment, chemotherapeutic agents may be used as adjuvant therapy.To describe modalities for accurate diagnosis and treatment of CIF.PubMed was searched using terms \"congenital infantile fibrosarcoma\" and \"infantile fibrosarcoma.\" Eleven relevant, English language articles were identified and utilized in the preparation of this case presentation.Complications addressed in this case presentation are prenatal diagnostic challenges, pharmacologic interventions in the setting of prematurity, immunosuppression, and acute liver and renal failure. Pharmacologic treatments will include chemotherapy agents, antimicrobial agents, as well as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for immunosuppression. Nursing challenges included positioning and integumentary disturbances.Utilization of diagnostic imaging and pathology to accurately identify and diagnose CIF is essential.Safety and efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents in premature infants with CIF need to be established.",

    "abstract": "Background: The utilization of placental blood for neonatal admission laboratory tests, specifically the complete blood cell (CBC) count and blood culture, has the potential to delay the onset of anemia of prematurity and intraventricular hemorrhage, frequency of blood transfusions and associated complications, and painful procedures related to laboratory sampling. Purpose: To determine the feasibility of drawing neonatal admission laboratory tests from the placenta rather than the neonate and to compare CBC count and blood culture results. Methods: All infants less than 35 weeks' gestational age and all term infants with a maternal history of chorioamnionitis or untreated, positive group B Streptococcus status were eligible to participate. Participating infants had paired CBC count and blood cultures obtained from the placenta and the infant. Results: All CBC count outcomes were significantly, positively correlated between placental and infant blood (all P s &lt; .05). The paired white blood cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes were strongly correlated ( r = 0.761, r = 0.797, and r = 0.815, respectively), whereas the hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet, and eosinophils were moderately correlated ( r = 0.554, r = 0.545, r = 0.563, and r = 0.478, respectively). Monocytes and basophils were only weakly correlated ( r = 0.373 and r = 0.217, respectively). There were 13 (93%) pairs where placental blood culture was positive but the direct infant draw blood culture was negative, and 1 (7%) pair where the placental culture was negative but the direct infant draw blood culture was positive. Implications for Practice: The results of this and other studies suggest that placental blood can be reliably used to obtain neonatal admission CBC count and blood cultures. Implications for Research: Further research is needed regarding the prevention of blood culture contamination, especially in vaginally delivered placentas. Institutions that adopt this procedure should perform quality improvement initiatives to monitor outcomes and add to the growing body of literature on the utilization of placental blood for neonatal admission laboratory tests.",

However, OFS is inconsistently defined, which impacts the ability to adequately evaluate OFS, identify risk factors, and implement interventions in clinical practice and research.To develop the defining attributes, antecedents, and consequences for the concept of OFS in preterm infants during their initial hospitalization.PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases were searched for English articles containing the key words \"oral feeding success\" and \"preterm infants.\" The Walker and Avant method for concept analysis was employed.Sixteen articles revealed the defining attributes, antecedents, and consequences. Defining attributes included (1) physiologic stability; (2) full oral feeding; and (3) combined criteria of feeding proficiency (≥30% of the prescribed volume during the first 5 minutes), feeding efficiency (≥1.5 mL/min over the entire feeding), and intake quantity (≥80% of the prescribed volume).The 3 defining attributes may be used in clinical practice to consistently evaluate OFS. The antecedents of OFS provide clinicians with a frame of reference to assess oral feeding readiness, identify risk factors, and implement effective interventions. The consequences of OFS allow clinicians to anticipate challenges when OFS is not achieved and create a care plan to support the infants.The empirical referents of OFS provide consistent and clear operational definitions of OFS for use in research. The antecedents and consequences may guide researchers to select specific measures or covariates to evaluate valid measures of OFS.",

Feasibility was assessed by documenting the process of training and utilizing volunteers, as well as tracking duration and frequency of DCP visits. Staff burnout measures were assessed using the Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS) before and after implementation. Infant infection rates before and after the introduction of volunteers were compared.Seventy-two volunteers were interested, and 25 (35%) completed the DCP competencies and provided sensory exposures to 54 neonates, who were visited an average of 8 times (range 1-15). Twelve (48%) DCPs did once-per-week visits, and 9 (36%) did at least 50 contact hours. MBI-HSS scores for staff emotional exhaustion (P < .001) and depersonalization (P < .006) were lower after DCP implementation. There were no differences in infant infection rates before and after DCP implementation (Fisher exact P = 1.000).Volunteer-based DCP programs may be feasible to implement in community hospitals and could help reduce staff emotional exhaustion and depersonalization without increasing the incidence of infant infections.Future research on NICU volunteer programs with larger sample sizes and different infant populations is warranted.",

    "abstract": "The neonatal intensive care unit is often a noisy, overstimulating environment that disrupts infants' regulation of physiological and behavioral states and interrupts caregiver bonding; however, infants benefit from early intervention, including the use of multimodal neurological enhancement (MMNE) intervention to provide appropriate neurodevelopmental stimulation. No one has investigated whether it assists infants in self-regulation.The purpose of this retrospective longitudinal analysis was to examine the effect of a music therapy intervention, MMNE, on self-regulation of premature infants as measured by changes in heart rate (HR).A convenience sample of 60 premature infants received 486 MMNE sessions provided by a board-certified music therapist (MT-BC). Documentation, taken during routine clinical services, involved recording infant's HRs from the standard monitor for 3 minutes at baseline, during, and after a 20-minute MMNE intervention.Infants' mean HRs were decreased during and post-MMNE sessions compared with baseline (P < .004 and P < .001, respectively). Furthermore, infants with a baseline HR above 170 had significant decreases both during and after the MMNE session (P < .001 for both time periods).Results of this study support the existing body of evidence showing the benefits of MMNE with premature infants. Based on our results, MMNE may help infants develop and demonstrate self-regulation as indicated by maintained HRs during and after the intervention as well as a lowered HR for infants who had high HRs prior to MMNE.Further research needs to be done regarding how infants process MMNE and its potential to aid sensory processing.",

Acute kidney injury survivors are at risk for renal dysfunction and chronic kidney disease and require long-term follow-up. Purpose: To maximize identification of AKI and ensure referral, we created guidelines for diagnosis, evaluation, and management of AKI. Methods/Search Strategy: Retrospective cohort study of neonatal intensive care unit patients treated before guideline implementation (cohort 1; n = 175) and after (cohort 2; n = 52). Outcome measures included AKI incidence, documented diagnosis, and pediatric nephrology consultation. Statistical methods included t tests, Fisher exact tests, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Findings/Results: We found 68 AKI episodes in 52 patients in cohort 1 and 15 episodes in 12 patients in cohort 2. Diagnosis and documentation of AKI improved after guideline implementation (C1:24/68 [35%], C2: 12/15 [80%]; P = .003) as did pediatric nephrology consultation (C1:12/68 [18%]; C2: 12/15 [80%]; P &lt; .001) and outpatient referral (C1: 3/47 [6%], C2:5/8 [63%]; P &lt; .01). Implications for Practice: Neonatal AKI guideline implementation was associated with improvements in recognition, diagnosis, and inpatient and outpatient nephrology consultation. Early recognition and diagnosis along with specialist referral may improve outcomes among neonatal AKI survivors, ensuring appropriate future monitoring and long-term follow-up. Implications for Research: Future research should continue to determine the long-term implications of early diagnosis of AKI and appropriate subspecialty care with follow-up.",

Abusive head trauma refers to any type of intentional head trauma an infant sustains, as a result of an injury to the skull or intracranial contents from a blunt force and/or violent shaking. The clinical question was: what evidence-based interventions have been implemented by neonatal nurses to prevent abusive head trauma in infants? PubMed was searched to obtain English language publications from 2005 to May 2014 for interventions focused on preventing abusive head trauma using the key term \"shaken baby syndrome.\" A total of 10 studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria. All of the interventions targeted prevention of abusive head trauma with information about abusive head trauma/shaken baby syndrome and the \"normal\" infant crying behaviors. Interventions taught parents why infants cried, how to calm the infants, ways to cope with inconsolable infants, and how to develop a plan for what to do if they could not cope anymore. Parents who participated in the interventions were consistently able to explain the information and tell others about the dangers of shaking infants compared to the control parents. Only 2 studies calculated the preintervention abusive head trauma rate and the postintervention frequency of abusive head trauma. Each found significant differences in abusive head trauma.",

    "abstract": "Preterm infants provided with sufficient nutrition to achieve intrauterine growth rates have the greatest potential for optimal neurodevelopment. Although human milk is the preferred feeding for preterm infants, unfortified human milk provides insufficient nutrition for the very low-birth-weight infant. Even after fortification with human milk fortifier, human milk often fails to meet the high protein needs of the smallest preterm infants, and additional protein supplementation must be provided. Although substantial evidence exists to support quantitative protein goals for human milk-fed preterm infants, the optimal type of protein for use in human milk fortification remains uncertain. This question was addressed through a PubMed literature search of prospective clinical trials conducted since 1990 in preterm or low-birth-weight infant populations. The following 3 different aspects of protein quality were evaluated: whey-to-casein ratio, hydrolyzed versus intact protein, and bovine milk protein versus human milk protein. Because of a scarcity of current studies conducted with fortified human milk, studies examining protein quality using preterm infant formulas were included to address certain components of the clinical question. Twenty-six studies were included in the review study. No definite advantage was found for any specific whey-to-casein ratio. Protein hydrolyzate products with appropriate formulations can support adequate growth and biochemical indicators of nutrition status and may reduce gastrointestinal transit time, gastroesophageal reflux events, and later incidence of atopic dermatitis in some infants. Plasma amino acid levels similar to those of infants fed exclusive human milk-based diets can be achieved with products composed of a mixture of bovine proteins, peptides, and amino acids formulated to replicate the amino acid composition of human milk. Growth and biochemical indicators of nutrition status are similar for infants fed human milk fortified with human milk protein and bovine milk protein.",

To maximize the neuroprotective effect in infants with HIE, hypothermia is initiated as soon as possible after birth. Many infants who would benefit from therapeutic hypothermia are not born at centers that have intensive care units or offer therapeutic hypothermia and are thus transported to a tertiary care center with a NICU, offering specialty services of therapeutic hypothermia and pediatric neurology. The neonatal transport team plays a significant role in the management of these critically ill infants. Clinical research provides data for safe and effective management of these infants during therapeutic hypothermia in the NICU; however, there are no evidence-based clinical guidelines for management before and during transport. The establishment of evidence-based guidelines for cooling before and during transport will facilitate early recognition of infants who would benefit from therapeutic hypothermia therapy, and decrease delay in initiation of therapy. Careful assessment, monitoring, and intervention by the transport team are critical to provide appropriate care and ensure safe transport of these infants.",

Off-label diuretic therapy is used in preterm and full-term infants to both optimize kidney function and improve respiratory status. Purpose: This article examines the literature specific to the impact of diuretic therapy in the NICU and compares the benefits versus risks of utilization as they pertain to the prevention and treatment of renal and pulmonary dysfunction in this population. Methods/Search Strategy: A comprehensive literature search of online databases was performed, utilizing: CINAHL via EBSCO, PubMed, and ProQuest. Full-text, peer-reviewed, clinical trials, and review articles published in the English language between 2005 and 2015 were searched. Findings/Results: Diuretics rank as the seventh most frequently prescribed medication in the NICU. More than 8% of all NICU patients and 37% of infants born at less than 32 gestational weeks and weighing less than 1500 g are exposed to diuretics. Benefits include lung fluid resorption acceleration, improved urine output, fluid retention counteraction, and augmentation of physiologic weight loss. Implications for Practice: Diuretics are currently utilized in the NICU at an alarming rate, without adequate clinical trials regarding their safety and efficacy of use. Implications for Research: Updated studies are needed regarding short- and long-term outcomes of diuretic use, as well as overall general outcome data regarding the impact and evaluation of diuretic usage in the NICU population.",

Prolonged exposure to morally distressing patient care experiences and other healthcare issues may lead to worry among nurses. When worry becomes excessive, nurses and advanced practice registered nurses may lose joy that gives meaning to their work. Enhancing meaning in work may have a positive impact on nurse satisfaction, engagement, productivity, and burnout. Purpose: To explore neonatal nurses' top professional satisfiers and top professional worries and concerns. Methods: A descriptive study was conducted in a convenience sample of neonatal nurses to identify the top professional satisfiers that get them up in the morning and the top professional worries and concerns that keep them awake at night. Results: Complete data were available for 29 neonatal nurses. The top professional satisfiers were caring for infants and families, making a difference, witnessing resilience, intellectual challenge of specialty, positive working relationships with colleagues, and educating parents and families. The top professional worries and concerns were staffing, missed care, workload, making a mistake, and failure to rescue. Implications for Practice: Healthcare and professional organizations must develop strategies to address occupational stress in today's complex healthcare environment. Identifying professional worries and concerns may help nurses navigate challenging and distressing situations. Furthermore, understanding nurses' professional satisfiers may promote personal and professional resiliency and help organizations create healthier workplace environments. Implications for Research: Future studies are needed to test effective interventions that may promote professional satisfaction and help neonatal nurses cope with occupational stressors.",

    "abstract": "Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects approximately 30% of infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and increases mortality risk by 50%. Current diagnostic criteria (serum creatinine rise with oliguria) cannot detect early-onset AKI, as up to 50% of nephron damage may occur by the time these abnormalities present. Once AKI is established, clinical management is often ineffective; therefore, prevention is key. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) offers a feasible, noninvasive approach to continuously monitor renal oxygenation trends over time, serving as a surrogate marker for renal perfusion. Purpose: To provide an overview of NIRS principles for measuring renal oxygenation, and to describe current evidence of how this technology is being used among infants admitted to the NICU relative to the prediction and identification of AKI. Methods: A comprehensive search of PubMed and CINHAL focused on renal NIRS studies in NICU preterm and term infants was conducted. Results: Findings from 34 studies were included. In term infants, reduced renal oxygenation correlated to invasive SvO 2 monitoring, predicted survivability and AKI. In preterm infants, reduced renal oxygenation was associated with AKI in one study, yet contrasting findings were reported in those with patent ductus arteriosus, including those who received prostaglandin inhibitors. Normative data in all infants were sparse. Implications for Practice: Renal NIRS may offer a noninvasive measurement of kidney hypoperfusion that may precede conventional diagnostic measures. Implications for Research: Normative data are lacking, the threshold for renal ischemia is not defined, and consensus guiding clinical treatment based on NIRS data is nonexistent.",

Data from the preintervention assessment was used to design an educational intervention on improving fathers' support. Following the intervention, a postintervention NPST was administered to fathers to determine whether there was an improvement in support perception.Improvement in the NICU fathers' perception of nursing staff support was noted between father groups. In addition, the NPST can be used to assess paternal support needs and develop staff education.Support provided to NICU fathers can enhance the father's perception of himself as an equal and competent caregiver, leading to improved father-infant bonding as the child ages. Educational interventions targeting father support should be a routine part of nursing staff training.Future research should examine the long-term effects of early paternal support on psychosocial, cognitive, and developmental outcomes of NICU infants.",

    "abstract": "There exists a group of rare, inherited scaly skin disorders, generally termed ichthyosis, that can be evident in the infant at the time of birth. Phenotypes for this disorder span the gamut of severity and may pose complex challenges to the healthcare provider.This article explores the 3 most common nonsyndromic forms of ichthyosis seen in neonates as follows: X-linked recessive, lamellar, and bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma. Moreover, harlequin ichthyosis, a lamellar subtype, is highlighted for being the most severe, clinically problematic, and often lethal form of the disorder.A description of each of these types and their incidence is included, followed by an explanation of the genetic mutations causing them. The phenotypes and natural history are reviewed, as is expected management of the disorder throughout the patient's lifetime.Considerations for the neonatal nurse practitioner charged with caring for these patients, including specific recommendations for care in the clinical setting, are discussed. Additionally, genetic counseling and the risks of reoccurrence are explored.Given the rare nature of this disorder, further research is warranted so that healthcare providers are prepared to provide optimal care to these fragile patients.",

    "abstract": "Background: The United States is in an opioid crisis with abuse among women on the rise over the past 10 years. Infants of opioid-dependent mothers are at risk for neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Neonatal abstinence syndrome can affect multiple systems and disrupt normal growth and development. It is for this reason that strategies to promote health such as breastfeeding need to be explored. This brief evaluates current evidence regarding breast milk and the impact it has on NAS. Purpose: The question guiding this brief is: “Does provision of breast milk reduce NAS withdrawal symptoms, decrease length of stay, and decrease the need for pharmacologic therapy for infants whose mothers are maintained on methadone or buprenorphine?” Search Strategy: CINHAL/MEDLINE Complete and PubMed databases were searched using key words—NAS and breastfeeding—and the search was limited to 10 years for English studies evaluating the effects of breast milk on severity of NAS, pharmacologic therapy, and length of stay whose mothers received methadone or buprenorphine during pregnancy. The search yielded 10 studies addressing these concerns. Findings: Breast milk may be beneficial for decreasing NAS severity, pharmacologic therapy, and length of stay. Implications for Practice: Strategies should be developed to support individualized plans based on maternal history, safety, and mother's choice. Implications for Research: Further research is needed utilizing matched case-controlled studies regarding breast milk and the influence on severity of NAS, need for pharmacologic therapy, length of stay, and neurologic outcomes. In addition, other factors should be investigated including abrupt weaning, polysubstance use, and readmissions.",

Background: Prior studies of pain caused by heel and arterial needlesticks found oral administration of 24% sucrose to significantly blunt pain during these painful procedures. No studies have evaluated this treatment with needlestick pain associated with PIV catheter insertion. Methods: Oral 24% sucrose or placebo solution was administered 2 minutes prior to PIV catheter insertion. Outcome measures were obtained prior to, during, and for 5 minutes after PIV catheter insertion. Investigators and caregivers were blinded to group assignment. Data were analyzed with longitudinal analysis of repeated measures, with P &lt; .05 for significance. Results: A total of 40 neonates (24% sucrose: N = 20; placebo: N = 20) were studied. Pain scores significantly increased from 3.2 ± 1.6 to a maximum of 7.6 ± 3.8 at the time of catheter insertion, returning to baseline levels 8 minutes after PIV catheter insertion ( P &lt; .001). No significant differences were found in pain, heart rate, or noninvasive oxygen saturation (Sp o 2 ) between the sucrose and placebo groups ( P &gt; 0.05). Implications for Practice: Results from this study did not find that 24% sucrose administered prior to PIV catheter insertion altered the infant's pain response. Implications for Research: Since this is the first study to evaluate the pain-blunting effects of 24% sucrose administration before PIV catheter insertion, replication of this study is needed before widespread application of findings.",

Purpose: Feeding guidelines for very low birth-weight (VLBW) infants were implemented in our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to start and achieve full enteral feeds sooner, and increase weight gain over the first month. Methods: Feeding guidelines for VLBW infants were implemented in January 2014, stratified by birth weight (&lt;750, 750-1000, and 1000-1500 g). After trophic feedings, enteral feedings were advanced by 20 to 30 mL/kg/d. Data were analyzed for 2 years prior (baseline) and 6 months after (guideline) guidelines were implemented and included days to initiation of enteral feeds, days on total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and weight gain over the first month. Potential concomitant factors that could affect feeding tolerance were examined including indomethacin or dopamine treatment, delivery room cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and growth restriction. Results: A total of 95 infants with a birth weight of less than 1500 g were included (59 baseline and 36 guideline). Days to start enteral feeds decreased by 47% ( P &lt; .01) and days on TPN decreased by 25% (16 days vs 11 days; P &lt; .01). Weight gain over the first month of life increased by 15% ( p &lt; .05). Dopamine and indomethacin use decreased during the study period, and small for gestational age infants were overrepresented in the guideline group. Implications for Practice/Research: Establishment of feeding guidelines for VLBW infants in our NICU reduced the days to start feeds and days on TPN while increasing weight gain over the first month. Improving growth and nutrition and reducing need for TPN in this vulnerable population may ultimately prevent infection and improve neurodevelopmental outcomes.",

Improving rates of USGIV use will subsequently decrease central venous catheter use and thus decrease the time to treatment initiation, reduce costs, and improve patient satisfaction.Current available programs teach nurses USGIV use for the adult population, mainly with a focus on the emergency department. To address this gap in knowledge, a USGIV program aimed at the specific needs of the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) nurse was developed and implemented.Twelve NICU nurses were trained in USGIV access during a 4-hour combination didactic and simulation-based program. Participants took a pretest survey assessing baseline knowledge and confidence levels related to USGIV access. After didactic lecture, participants worked at stations focused on USGIV access. An 80% benchmark for each participant was set for successful USGIV attempts during simulation. Participants' knowledge and confidence levels were reassessed at the end of the program.Posttest scores increased by an average of 25%, demonstrating increased knowledge. The pre- to posttest confidence scores increased by a minimum of 1.6 points (based on a 5-point Likert scale). All participants (n = 12) successfully demonstrated proficiency by achieving at least 80% of attempted USGIV access on a mannequin.This project demonstrated that USGIV catheter can be employed in neonatal patients by training NICU nurses in USGIV techniques.",

    "abstract": "Background: Improved health outcomes for critically ill infants including neurodevelopmental, immunological, and cost benefits are dependent upon the dose and duration of mother's own milk feedings. However, mothers of infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) must express their milk (pump-dependent) and often struggle with milk production. Purpose: To examine the state of the science on nonpharmacologic modifiable expression factors that may influence milk production in pump-dependent mothers of critically ill infants admitted to the NICU. Data Sources: PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL databases from 2005 to 2020. Search Strategy: Guided by the lactation conceptual model, the authors searched for peer-reviewed studies with terms related to milk volume, pump dependency, critically ill infants, and modifiable factors, which may influence milk volume and assessed 46 eligible studies. Data Extraction: Data were extracted by 3 reviewers with a systematic staged review approach. Results: Evidence from 26 articles found expressed milk volume may be influenced by multiple potentially modifiable factors. Simultaneous expression with a hospital-grade electric pump at least 5 times per day beginning 3 to 6 hours after delivery, and adding complementary techniques including hand expression, hands-on-pumping, music, breast massage, warm compresses, skin-to-skin care, and the mother expressing near her infant may promote increased milk volume. Implications for Practice and Research: Healthcare providers should assist pump-dependent mothers with early initiation and frequent milk removal with a hospital-grade breast pump. Further research is needed to explore optimal frequency of expressions, dose and timing of skin-to-skin care, and other targeted strategies to improve expressed milk volume.",

Since 2018, NCMNs at our hospital have been cared for by the Neonatal Complex Care Team. This model has yet to be evaluated. To inform the evaluation of our care model, we examined literature on care practices for the management of NCMNs and utilized that to define outcome measures. MEDLINE and Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature were searched. Inclusion dates: January 1, 1993, until July 15, 2023. The PRISMA extension for scoping reviews was used. The population was neonates in the neonatal intensive care unit, the concept was models of care, and the context was medical complexity. Two reviewers performed the title/abstract screening and full-text review. A total of 148 articles were screened, 17 fully reviewed, and 5 articles included. Data extraction was completed by one reviewer utilizing resources from the Joanna Briggs Institute. Care practices ranged from structured discharge meetings with families to an inpatient care model. Few reported new clinical models, and long-term health outcome data were limited. Multidisciplinary care teams emerged as crucial to in-hospital care and smooth discharge. Length of stay and readmission were identified as key outcomes for clinical program evaluation. There is limited literature on this topic; however, we identified themes and outcomes that are useful for clinical program evaluation. Long-term evaluation of novel models of care is needed.",

Recent research has introduced infant-driven incubator protocols that are demonstrating promise. Purpose: This study, conducted at a freestanding academic pediatric hospital in the mid-Atlantic, examined the impact of infant-led incubator weaning on a specific neonatal cohort. The primary hypothesis posited that infants in the infant-led weaning group would wean out of the incubator at earlier gestational ages and lower weights, while maintaining comparable or greater weight gain during the transition to open cribs. Methods: A retrospective chart review compared 40 infants weighing less than 1500 g before and after a weaning protocol change. Results: Infant-led weaning demonstrated lower weights at weaning to crib ( M = 1836.80 g) compared with nurse-led weaning ( M = 1975.9 g), with statistical significance ( t [36] = 2.27, P = .02, Cohen’s d = 0.74). Infants in the infant-led group had a lower weight change 5 days prior to weaning ( M = 141 g) compared with the nurse-led group ( M = 185 g), which is also statistically significant ( t [36] = 1.93, P = .03, Cohen’s d = 0.63). T-tests revealed no significant differences in gestational age at wean to crib, change in weight post-weaning, gestational age, or days to discharge. Implications for Practice and Research: Infant-led weaning emerges as a safe alternative with potential benefits for preterm neonates and their families. While initial positive outcomes are evident, further research with a larger neonatal cohort is imperative to validate the efficacy of infant-led weaning as a successful alternative to traditional methods.",

To investigate associations between perceived stress among parents with infants treated in the NICU and sociodemographic characteristics (educational level), clinical factors (labor week, birthweight, previous miscarriage), dyadic adjustment, illness perception, and healthcare satisfaction. In this descriptive, correlational, cross-sectional study, parents ( N = 259) of infants treated in the NICU were recruited by convenience sampling. Study questionnaires, \"Parent-Infant Descriptive Information Form, Perceived Stress Scale, Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire, Dyadic Adjustment Scale, and PedsQL Healthcare Satisfaction Scale\" were administered to parents. Correlation and regression analyses were conducted. Perceived stress level of the parents was high. Parents' perceptions of their infants' illness, satisfaction with healthcare, and dyadic adjustment accounted for 77.8% of their perceived stress. Interventions that promote coping with stress, enhance dyadic adjustment, and increase healthcare satisfaction for parents may promote parents' mental health and may also be crucial to maintain a positive infant-parent relationship. Moreover, because parents reported less stress when they had a positive perception of their infants' diseases, parents should be encouraged to ask questions about their infant's diagnosis, and clinicians should provide anticipatory guidance.",

Infants with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) are often admitted to neonatal intensive care units (NICU) where the development of coregulation between mothers and infants is easily disrupted. Understanding early mother-infant coregulation is needed to guide intervention strategies for these high-risk mother-infant dyads. Explore the impact of prenatal opioid exposure on mother-infant coregulation, as an indicator of early infant neurodevelopment, in response to a standardized stress experiment, the Still Face Paradigm (SFP). A prospective cohort design was used to enroll opioid-exposed (N = 11) and non-exposed (N = 13) mother-infant dyads, when infants discharged from the NICU were 6 to 9 months. Dyadic heart rate variability (HRV) data were used as a measure of coregulation and were recorded using heart rate monitors during the 3 phases of the SFP: (a) baseline, (b) still-face, or flat affect, and (c) reunion. We conducted analyses to determine differences within the HRV dyad profiles. HRV profiles differed between the 2 study groups. In the opioid-exposed group: (a) infants exhibited more irregular autonomic processes, (b) mothers had higher HRV baselines, and (c) there was an overall dysregulation between mothers and infants compared to the non-opioid exposed group. These differences may suggest that prenatal opioid exposure contributes to difficulty with dyadic co-regulation which may negatively impact early infant neurodevelopment. Additional research is needed to better understand the role of prenatal opioid exposure in infant neurodevelopment.",

This was a longitudinal 2-group cohort study using secondary analysis of existing data of 313 infants born ≤32 weeks gestation and weighing ≤1500 g. Information regarding nutritional outcomes was obtained from the infant's electronic medical records. While not statistically significant, male infants reached full feeds nearly 3 days later (18.1 vs 15.2; P = .89), required parenteral nutrition for nearly an additional 4 days (18.3 vs 14.1; P = .37), and had a central line for 3 days longer (19.6 vs 15.7; P = .65) than female infants. Males had higher direct bilirubin levels (P = .02), more emesis (P = .003), and more late-onset sepsis (P = .03).

We used three levels of the socio-ecological model, including the individual, microsystem, and macrosystem, to guide our multiple case study analysis. Qualitative, latent content analysis was used to focus on identifying and understanding barriers and facilitators to breastfeeding across these various levels. Participants across groups identified barriers to breastfeeding at all three socio-ecological model levels, while facilitators were only identified at the individual and microsystem levels. Across the different levels of the socio-ecological model, six subthemes emerged: (1) breastfeeding knowledge and readiness; (2) infant factors; (3) support; (4) daily routines; (5) organizational environment; and (6) policies. Application of the socio-ecological model to identify barriers and facilitators to breastfeeding may inform approaches that are sustainable and more likely to improve rates of breastfeeding over time for mothers receiving medication for OUDs.",

    "abstract": "There is sufficient evidence to support safe discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) with nasogastric tube (NGT) feedings when appropriate caregiver education, outpatient support, and feeding therapy are available. We sought to identify infants eligible for safe discharge with NGT feedings to reduce NICU length of stay and avert unnecessary surgical gastrostomy tube (GT) placement. A protocol with infant eligibility criteria for NICU discharge with NGT feedings was developed and implemented. A focus group was conducted to identify perceived successes, barriers and lessons learned. There was low uptake of the new protocol. Barriers to implementation included inconsistent protocol adoption by NICU providers, concerns about lack of outpatient support, and significant language barriers for non-English speaking families. Outpatient multidisciplinary support is crucial to successfully implement home NGT feedings upon NICU discharge. A well-developed protocol provides eligibility standards and decision support.",

    "abstract": "Background: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted our practice of outpatient methadone weaning for pharmacologic management of infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), resulting in increased average length of stay (ALOS). In response, we integrated a responsive Bassinet (SNOO), into our Eat, Sleep, Console (ESC) care model. Purpose: Our primary aim through this quality improvement work was to explore whether integration of SNOO within our ESC care model had an impact. Methods: Using quality improvement methodologies, a retrospective chart review was conducted for neonates admitted to the NICU for NAS from December 2020 to September 2022 ( N = 109). Study inclusion criteria were primary diagnosis of NAS, birth gestational age ≥35 weeks, and absence of other co-morbid diagnoses. Neonates were organized into two groups based on date of bassinet implementation. An online survey was sent to 76 NICU nurses 6 months post-implementation. Outcome measures included ALOS, number of sleep-related “yes” scores (indicating poor sleep), and nurse experience. Results: Of 109 infants, 13 met inclusion criteria ALOS declined by 17.38% ( P= .57), and “yes” scores decreased by 41.72% ( P =.52). Nurses reported an average of 2.43 hours saved per 12-hour shift. Implications for Practice and Research: The addition of SNOO as a non-pharmacologic intervention within ESC care models for infants with NAS may lead to a decreased average length of stay, improved infant sleep, and improved nursing experience (such as time savings).",

    "abstract": "Background: Infants who require a stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) may require significantly higher levels of care once they are ready for discharge. Although providers try to ensure a smooth transition to home, caregivers may not be fully prepared for home life and may need questions or concerns addressed before their follow-up appointments. Providing telemedicine (TM) visits shortly after NICU discharge may ease these issues and improve care. Purpose: The primary aim of this quality improvement project was to obtain family feedback on potential benefits of post-NICU discharge TM visits conducted by a neonatal nurse practitioner. A secondary aim was to determine if a recent change in the nutrition discharge process was beneficial to caregivers. Methods: All infants discharged from the NICU who had a TM appointment (N = 35) from April to December 2022 were eligible for the telephone interview. Semi-structured caregiver interviews were conducted with the team dietitian by telephone within 2 weeks of the TM FU. Results: Of those who had TM appointments, 30 families participated in the interviews (85.7%), and 28 (93.3%) reported finding the visits beneficial. Implications: Families found TM visits after NICU discharge to be beneficial. TM visits may serve as a safety net for families who at the time of NICU discharge do not yet realize the types of challenges that they will face once home.",

    "abstract": "Background: Mothers of infants with congenital anomalies may experience challenges with milk production. Antenatal milk expression (AME) is thought to support milk production, as past research suggests it facilitates secretory activation. However, past research relied on self-reported data. Purpose: This study examined secretory activation and coming to volume, 2 critical stages of postpartum milk production, by measurement of human milk biomarkers from days 1 to 7 and 24-hour milk volume from birth until day 14 in mothers of infants with congenital anomalies who practiced AME. Methods: Women carrying infants with congenital anomalies received AME education, did AME, gave birth, and recorded their 24-hour pumping frequency and milk volume. An ion selective electrode (ISE) and laboratory analysis were used to measure human milk biomarkers. Results: Sixteen mothers completed AME, and all infants were born at term. Most mothers (87.5%) had normal biomarkers at least once, but biomarkers did not stay in normal range. Four mothers (25%) experienced secretory activation within 72 hours after birth. The pumping frequency and 24-hour milk volume varied. Only 9 (56.25%) mothers secreted ≥500 mL of milk by day 14. Implications for Practice: AME may offer benefits, but secretory activation does not appear to be impacted. The ISE shows promise as a nursing-driven intervention to screen for potential milk volume concerns. Implications for Research: Further research is needed on AME and human milk biomarkers in this at-risk population.",

    "abstract": "Background: Low-birth weight infants are at risk for neurodevelopmental complications. Prolonged mechanical ventilation and endotracheal tube stability can compromise developmentally supportive positioning and result in positional head deformity (PHD). Nationally, PHD prevalence is 22%-66%, yet an internal audit of 93 neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) discharge summaries found normal head assessments. Purpose: To evaluate PHD prevalence among NICU preterm infants and neurodevelopmental positioning practice. Methods: A convenience sample of 50 NICU preterm infants &gt;72 hours of life discharged alive were selected to establish PHD prevalence. Positioning was observed on all active NICU infants. Infants with other deformities or receiving palliative care were excluded. Measures included gender, gestational age (GA) and birth weight, length of stay (LOS), positioning using the Infant Positioning Assessment Tool (IPAT), and the investigator’s head shape assessment at discharge. Results: The prevalence of PHD was 12% (n = 6) though clinician notes reported normal findings. Infants with PHD had a significantly lower GA at birth ( P = .010), and at discharge, had a smaller head ( P = .027) and a longer LOS ( P = .008). Positioning was observed on 78 infants over 4 consecutive weeks; mean GA = 31.29 ± 0.41 weeks; weight = 1713.56 ± 83.70 g. Of the 572 observations, 84% were therapeutic; hand positioning had the lowest scores. Implications for Practice and Research: The PHD prevalence rate for low birth-weight infants is likely underreported. The IPAT hand position element may need validation for extremely low birth-weight infants. Better documentation structures are needed to accurately describe and trend infant head shape.",

Purpose: This study aims to examine the relationships between objective noise measurements and nurses’ subjective perceptions in the NICU and analyze how these measurements vary by location and time of day during quiet hours. Methods: In this observational study, noise was measured in 12 bays of an open-bay NICU during set times in the morning, afternoon, and evening. Subjective ratings of perceived noise were solicited from 25 nurses during these periods, converted to numerical scores, and ranked to categorize the bays into 3 measurement areas: loud, intermediate, and quiet. Noise indices were tested for associations with noise score, measurement area, and time by correlation and variance analyses. Results: The equivalent continuous sound level ( L eq ) ranged from 55 to 63 dB over 60-minute measurement periods. The L 5 (level exceeded 5% of the 60-minute period) and the L 50 (level exceeded 50% of the 60-minute period) were analyzed to capture short-duration high noise levels and typical ambient noise, respectively. Noise ratings showed weak correlations with L eq , L 5 , L 50 , and minimum sound levels (L min ). Implications for Practice and Research: Strategies that consider location and time of day, with measures against sudden noise, are needed for NICU care. Future research should address comprehensive assessments of noise sources and their impact evaluation on preterm infants.",

    "abstract": "Laryngomalacia is characterized by diminished laryngeal tone, leading to the dynamic prolapse of supraglottic tissues into the airway. This often results in inspiratory stridor, airway obstruction and feeding difficulties. This report presents quantitative data on respiratory-swallow coordination recorded by NeoSAFE during breastfeeding and bottle-feeding in a preterm infant with laryngomalacia. A preterm infant, born at 34+3 weeks of gestation and weighing 2090 g, was diagnosed with laryngomalacia, confirmed by clinical symptoms including inspiratory stridor and feeding difficulties, as well as by endoscopic evaluation. NeoSAFE, a device for real-time monitoring of swallowing and respiration, was used to record and analyze the infant's respiratory-swallow coordination during both breastfeeding and bottle-feeding. Key parameters included rhythmic swallowing rate, total swallow count, respiratory rate, and resting period. The NeoSAFE data revealed a higher respiratory rate during bottle-feeding compared to breastfeeding, suggesting potential challenges in coordinating breathing with swallowing during bottle-feeding. In contrast, breastfeeding was associated with a shorter resting period and higher rhythmic swallowing rate, indicating more effective respiratory-swallow coordination. Clinically, less stridor was heard in the infant during breastfeeding, suggesting that breastfeeding was better tolerated. Based on these findings, breastfeeding may be preferred for infants with laryngomalacia to improve respiratory-swallow coordination and reduce airway complications. The NeoSAFE device offers valuable insights into feeding mechanics, suggesting its utility in managing feeding strategies for infants with respiratory and swallowing challenges.",

Purpose: To compare the incidence of respiratory morbidity in Black and White infants, and to identify if pulmonary maturation differences exist. Data Sources: Databases included MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Elsevier), and Web of Science (Clarivate). Study Selection: All identified studies were uploaded into Covidence.

Data Extraction: A citation tracking system was used to identify relevant studies included in the full text review. Results: Though differences among Black and White infants were present, it was not found that race alone had a causal impact on an infant’s pulmonary maturation, but rather that these differences in outcomes could be related to health disparities impacted by race. Implications for Practice and Research: As providers driving care and making treatment decisions for neonatal patients, we must be aware of our implicit biases regarding neonatal lung development. Additional research is essential to drive policy change and ensure equitable healthcare and reduce infant mortality and morbidity.",

Although maternal voice and lullabies are safe non-pharmacological options for pain relief, their effectiveness remains uncertain. Purpose: This study examined the effects of maternal voice and lullabies on pain and physiological parameters in preterm infants during oropharyngeal aspiration procedures in the NICU. Methods: This randomized controlled trial included 66 preterm infants (28-36 weeks gestation) randomly assigned to maternal voice (n = 22), lullaby (n = 22), or control (n = 22) groups. Intervention groups received a recording of maternal voice or lullaby for 15 minutes before, during, and 15 minutes after aspiration. The control group received no auditory stimulation. Pain was assessed using the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale, and heart rate, oxygen saturation, and respiration were recorded at 3 time points. Data analysis included chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests with Bonferroni-adjusted Mann-Whitney U tests for post-hoc comparisons ( P &lt; .05). Results: The maternal voice group exhibited significantly lower pain levels during and after the procedure than other groups ( P &lt; .001). Both intervention groups showed improved physiological parameters ( P &lt; .05), with maternal voice showing the most effective outcomes ( P &lt; .05). Implications for Practice and Research: Maternal voice and lullabies may effectively reduce pain and enhance physiological stability in preterm infants during aspiration. Integrating maternal voice into NICU care may enhance pain management and physiological stability in preterm infants. Future research should explore long-term effects, the role of maternal voice characteristics, and the impact of ambient NICU noise levels on intervention effectiveness.",

Understanding the relationship between these psychological factors and breastfeeding outcomes can help develop targeted interventions to support mothers in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between breastfeeding self-efficacy and anxiety levels on the success of breastfeeding among mothers with infants staying in the NICU. Methods: A descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted in a private hospital from May 2018 to February 2019 in Turkey. The inclusion criteria for the study were as follows: mothers over 18 years old who had a live birth at 34 weeks or above without any breastfeeding hindrances such as cleft lip or palate and infants who were not discharged within the first 24 hours after birth, had no congenital anomalies, and did not undergo any surgical procedures. Data were collected with the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale and the State-Trait and Anxiety Inventory. LATCH Breastfeeding Assessment Tool was used as a measure of breastfeeding success. Results: The study involved 83 mothers and 83 infants. Breastfeeding self-efficacy had a statistically significant relationship on maternal success in terms of breastfeeding the infant for the first time ( P &lt; .001) and 24 hours after the initial feeding ( P &lt; .001). However, state and trait anxiety had no statistically significant effect on breastfeeding success ( P &gt; .05).

    "abstract": "Background: Interdisciplinary family meetings reduce parental traumatic stress and promote shared decisions in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Existing definitions of family meetings derive from adult studies. NICUs need NICU-specific criteria reflecting their distinct clinical and psychosocial context. Purpose: To identify NICU parent and clinician values and expectations about the structure and functions of family meetings to develop a NICU-specific definition and checklist for quantifying neonatal family meetings. Methods: Qualitative thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with parents and clinical professionals recruited from an academic, quaternary-care NICU. Results: Thirteen parents and 25 professionals (16 nurses, 7 neonatologists, 2 social workers) defined a NICU family meeting as a seated, serious conversation in a private room involving a patient’s parents, nurse, and neonatologist. This definition translated to a checklist capturing meeting location and participants. Participants differentiated “meetings” (“serious” conversations needed when parents and professionals lack a shared understanding of the child’s condition) from “updates” (“general” parent-professional conversations). Participants identified logistical and cultural barriers to holding crucial meetings and generated solutions. Implications for practice: This study identified nurse presence and participation as essential for serious conversations with NICU families. Nursing and hospital leaders can implement the resultant NICU-centered definition and checklist for neonatal family meetings into health informatic systems to promote parent-professional communication and to prospectively monitor unit-wide family-centered care. Implications for research: Future research should validate the checklist across diverse NICUs, assess its impact on family outcomes, and identify solutions to barriers limiting nurse participation in family meetings.",

It heightens nurses’ stress, reduces competence, and affects care quality. Addressing these challenges is vital for improved outcomes for nurses and patients. Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of workshop-based ethics education on the competence of NICU nurses in facing ECs. Methods: This quasi-experimental study (2022-2023) used a pretest-posttest 2-group design. 70 nurses were initially recruited from Arash Hospital and Children’s Medical Center, but 68 completed it. Nurses were convenience-sampled and randomly assigned to control (n = 33) and intervention (n = 35) groups. Participants completed demographic and Ethical Challenges in NICU Questionnaires at pretest, 1 month, and 2 months post-intervention. The 6-session ethics education workshop spanned 2.5 months. Data were analyzed using SPSS (v. 20). Results: The pretest scores showed no significant differences between the control and intervention groups, ensuring comparable baseline levels of ethical competencies. The intervention group’s EC questionnaire scores, along with its 4 dimensions, significantly decreased ( P &lt; .05), while no significant changes occurred in the control group ( P &gt; .05). Posttest scores in the intervention group were significantly lower than the control group’s ( P &lt; .05), despite no differences at pretest ( P &gt; .05). Implication for Practice and Research: Workshop-based ethics education positively impacts NICU nurses’ competence in addressing ECs. While successful in our hospital, it shows potential for enhancing ethical competencies in other NICU environments or regions.

A high level of parent participation, called Parent-Partnered Care, integrates parents as full partners in the delivery of hospital care to their infants. One parent-partnered intervention that improves infant, parent, and parent-infant outcomes is H-HOPE (Hospital to Home: Optimizing the Preterm Infant Environment). H-HOPE has 2 components: Massage+ and Parents+. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to present an evidence-based guide showing how to deliver Parents+ and the implications for nursing practice. Methods: The nursing approach to Parents+ includes participatory guidance and social support, which fosters a partnership with parents. The guidelines for using participatory guidance include a detailed description of each teaching/learning session along with implications for nursing practice. Results: Parents’ experienced many benefits from participating in the Parents+ sessions. They reported feeling more confident in the care of their infant and more satisfied with learning and delivering Massage+. Additionally, parents also reported less fears handling their infants, increased feelings of bonding/attachment, and a sensitivity/responsiveness to their infant’s behavioral cues. Implications for practice: Parents+ presents an opportunity for nurses to help parents engage with their infants and increase their confidence and competence. Parents’ desire a neonatal intensive care unit culture that embraces a comprehensive collaborative approach with healthcare professionals that is individualized to their infant’s health and well-being.",

    "abstract": "Background: Supporting preterm infants with mother’s own milk (MOM) can improve health outcomes and decrease mortality. Lactation in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is a disconnected process that often requires mothers to initiate lactation with a breast pump. One solution to improve the mothers’ experience is to bring mothers and infants together by expressing milk at the infant’s bedside. Purpose: This study evaluated the feasibility (eg. enrollment, retention, adherence) and maternal experience of daily bedside milk expression for the first month of NICU admission for mothers of infants born at ≤32 weeks. Methods: A convergent mixed methods approach evaluated the feasibility of bedside milk expression in the NICU. English- and Spanish-speaking mothers were asked to express milk at the bedside and complete a daily survey for one month. After 30 days, the mothers participated in a qualitative interview to understand their experiences. Results: Out of 32 mothers approached, 28 consented. Most mothers were Black/African American (n = 9) or Hispanic/White (n = 17). The study met the a priori criteria for enrollment and retention but not the criteria for adherence. Barriers were similar between mothers and did not influence adherence to bedside milk expression. The qualitative analysis found that coping moderated the barriers and facilitators to expressing milk at the bedside. The guiding framework was modified to demonstrate the influence of coping on lactation behaviors. Implications for practice: Interventions to improve maternal coping may improve adherence to bedside milk expression.",

Although relatively rare, Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is one of the common non-alloimmune hemolytic disorders associated with severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and hemolytic anemia during childhood. HS results from a mutation in genes encoding 1 or more proteins in the erythrocyte membrane, which leads to a loss of membrane structure and dysfunction of the cell. The clinical spectrum of HS varies widely, leading to under-diagnosis during the neonatal period, and management differs from alloimmune hemolytic disorders.

Subsequent decrease in bilirubin levels and safe discharge of neonate with instructions to follow up with pediatrician, hematology, and genetics with outpatient appointments. In this case report, we emphasize the need for a high index of suspicion among neonatal caregivers and discuss management options.

    "abstract": "Background: High levels of nurse stress and burnout, including among Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) nurses, were documented prior to the pandemic. The pandemic increased stressors for NICU nurses although not all NICUs were affected in the same way. Purpose: To examine the relationship between NICU nurses’ perceived stress and burnout during a period of workforce strain. Methods: A secondary analysis of cross-sectional survey data collected from 259 nurses in 10 NICUs enrolled in a parent study between 2021 and 2023. A researcher-developed questionnaire captured nurses’ demographic and work characteristics at the time of parent study enrollment. Perceived stress was measured using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and burnout was assessed using the Emotional Exhaustion (EE) subscale of the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Descriptive statistics and multivariable linear regression were used for the analysis. Results: The mean EE score was 19.7, and more than half of all participants reported a moderate or high degree of burnout. Higher PSS scores, more years of NICU experience, and more weekly hours in direct patient care were associated with higher EE scores. Variation in EE score distribution was observed between NICUs, and the relationship between perceived stress and burnout varied by NICU. Implications for practice and research: We observed high levels of stress and burnout with experienced nurses and those providing direct care most at risk. Strategies to reduce burnout include periodic reduction of direct patient care hours and support tailored to nurses’ career stages. Future research should focus on intervention development and testing.",

    "abstract": "Background: Water insecurity (WI) – or the inability to access affordable and clean water for the purposes of drinking, cooking, sanitation and hygiene – represents a critical nexus between environmental and public health. Rural and agricultural communities with limited economic and municipal resources are disproportionately affected by WI, and these inequities contribute to poorer neonatal health outcomes. Purpose: This review uses the Integrated Socio-Environmental Model of Health (ISEM) to explore the root causes of water insecurity in California’s San Joaquin Valley. It aims to evaluate current research connecting water insecurity and neonatal outcomes and identify areas needing further study. Methods: This review applies ISEM as a conceptual framework to analyze the multifactorial contributors to WI in California’s San Joaquin Valley (SJV) – a region characterized by rural, agricultural communities. We assess the current state of the science on WI and neonatal outcomes in rural, disadvantaged communities of the SJV, identifying key research gaps and proposing directions for future investigation. Results: Water insecurity has been linked to the health outcomes of newborns and infants both directly and through inter-generational effects. The disproportionately elevated rates of neonatal morbidity and mortality in California’s SJV, compounded by escalating WI driven by the climate crisis and environmental degradation, underscore the critical need for targeted public health interventions. Implications for Practice and Research: Clinicians and researchers aiming to investigate or prevent the impacts of WI on neonatal health outcomes should consider implementation of WI questionnaires and scales to assess at a household level a person or family’s ability to access clean water.",

    "abstract": "The relative size of a neonate impacts many aspects of prenatal and postnatal surveillance and care. The designations of appropriate for gestational age, small-for-gestational age, intrauterine growth restriction, and large-for-gestational age are systematic categorizations used to assess and monitor growth throughout pregnancy and delivery. Each abnormal growth descriptor aids in anticipating neonatal needs after birth because each has the potential for complications related to feeding, glucose utilization, short- and long-term growth, and development. Maternal risk factors that impact the neonate's size-related can have immediate implications in the delivery room as well as significant effects postnatally. Caring for neonates at risk for size complications requires knowledge based on prenatal and postnatal complications. Neonates must be carefully measured and plotted on growth charts to confirm a visual assessment of size. Each growth complication requires individual attention to detail and careful planning to maximize adequate postnatal growth and nutrition. Size matters when it comes to the health and welfare of neonates. Anticipatory guidance can improve outcomes in the neonate at risk for failure to thrive from size complications at birth. Part 1 of this article provides an overview of the size classifications and a discussion of clinical factors that are associated with or contribute to small-for-gestational age births. Once the neonate's size for gestational age is calculated, a focused physical assessment is described along with nursing care and prognostic implications. Part 2 will focus on the physical assessment, nursing care, prognosis, and complications associated with large-for-gestational-age neonates.",

SUBJECTS Each cubicle of the 32-bed NICU, distributed across 5 rooms, in a level III nursery was measured. METHODS Temperatures were recorded at a consistent time on one day during January, April, July, and October. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES An electronic monitor (QUESTemp° 34; Quest Technologies, Oconomowoc, Wisconsin) was used to measure dry bulb, wet bulb, and globe thermometer temperatures. RESULTS Analysis of variance revealed statistically significant (P < .000) differences in season, room, and season by room interaction. Room ambient air temperatures differed by less than 2°F across season. Radiant temperature paralleled air temperature. Humidity, the predominant difference across season, produced evaporative temperatures considerably lower than room air temperature, and the gradient between mean nursery dry bulb temperature and wet bulb temperature was 9.3°F in summer and 16.8°F in winter. CONCLUSIONS The thermal map revealed seasonal thermal differences, particularly in humidity level and evaporative temperature. Room temperature alone does not reflect the total thermal environment. Recommendations include periodic assessment of nurseries along with air, evaporative, and radiant temperatures as well as humidity to fully appreciate the impact of the thermal environment on infants.",

Knowledge and awareness of these risks by the flight team can help to alleviate unnecessary risks and complications encountered during air transportation and ensure a safe arrival of both the team and the patient.",

Nutritional guidelines vary widely regarding feeding regimens and there is not a widely accepted consensus on the optimal feeding interval.To critically examine the evidence to determine whether there is a relationship to feeding intervals and feeding outcomes in premature infants.A systematic review of the literature in the following databases: PubMed, CINAHL, Embase and the Cochrane Library. The search strategy used the terms infant premature, low birth weight, enteral feeding, feed tolerance and feed intervals.Search results yielded 10 studies involving 1269 infants (birth weight ≤1750 g). No significant differences in feed intolerance, growth, or incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis were observed. Evidence suggests that infants fed at 2 hourly intervals reached full feeds faster than at 3 hourly intervals, had fewer days on parenteral nutrition, and fewer days in which feedings were withheld. Decrease in the volume of gastric residuals and feeding interruptions were observed in the infants fed at 3 hourly intervals than those who were continuously fed.Reducing the feed interval from 3 to 2 hourly increases nurse workload, yet may improve feeding outcomes by reducing the time to achieve full enteral feeding.Studies varied greatly in the definition and management of feeding intolerance and in how outcomes were measured, analyzed, and reported. The term \"intermittent\" is used widely but can refer to a 2 or 3 hourly interval.",

Little research has been conducted on the culture of Iranian NUs and the impact this has on mothers' emotional caregiving experiences. Purpose: To explore the emotional caregiving experiences of mothers in an Iranian NU. Methods: Focused ethnography was used for this study. Mothers (n = 19) of term and preterm infants participated. Data were collected using observations and interviews. Roper and Shapira's 5-step framework was used to analyze the data. Findings: Four major themes emerged: ( a ) fear, ( b ) loneliness, ( c ) competence, and ( d ) pleasure. Fear occurred when mothers felt unprepared to care for their infants. They were afraid of harming their infant or repeating previous mistakes . Loneliness consisted of bearing the burden of care while feeling alone . Competence occurred when the mothers experienced an increasing ability to provide care for their infants and a growing self-confidence . Finally, the mothers described pleasure as they began to feel worthiness as mothers and intense love for their infants. Implications for Practice: The sense of fear and loneliness shared by these mothers has significant implications for practice. While it may be a challenge for nurses to provide adequate support for mothers due to the heavy workload of Iranian NUs, close relatives and other support persons may play a key role. Implications for Research: Future research should be conducted on the impact of maternal support on mothers' NU experiences in Iran.",

A single prospective case study was used for this article. Data were recorded every 15 minutes for 96 hours. Each observation was categorized according to treatment phase: cooling 0 to 72 hours, rewarming, and controlled normal temperature up to 96 hours. Structured observations were carried out and all nursing care was documented. In addition, 5 periods with no other nursing interventions were identified in which data were recorded every minute for analysis. Skin conductance algimetry showed a variable response during treatment. During cooling, 68% of the 15-minute periods, signs of stress and pain were recorded. During rewarming, the corresponding figure was 83%. During the time sequences with normal temperature, 89% of the periods were associated with stress and pain. During 80% of the nursing procedures, the SCA showed stress and pain. There was no correlation between the pain-rating scales and SCA. When the cooling blanket temperature was lower than core temperature, the infant had more stress and pain according to SCA (P < .001) and an increase in heart rate and blood pressure (P < .001). In infants during induced hypothermia, SCA seem to detect pain and stress. Future evaluation of SCA for the detection of pain and stress during hypothermia treatment is necessary. Pain-rating scales do not appear reliable in this case report.",

    "abstract": "Background: The incidence of neonatal thrombocytopenia is low, yet highly dependent on the populations studied. Purpose: To assess the incidence of neonatal thrombocytopenia and identify factors associated with its outcomes, namely time to disease onset, recovery duration, and platelet count. Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted between May and October 2013 at a large tertiary care facility in Saudi Arabia. Neonates with a platelet count of fewer than 150,000/μL of blood were followed up until their recovery or death. Results: The period incidence of neonatal thrombocytopenia was 84/4379 (1.9%). The mortality rate associated with the condition was 68/100,000 births. The male-female ratio of neonates with thrombocytopenia was 2.4:1. The mean (standard deviation) time to disease onset was 1.83 (1.29) days, whereas that of recovery duration was 15.35 (18.46) days. The mean (standard deviation) platelet count at onset was 109,543 (32,826)/μL of blood, whereas that of the increase in platelet count from onset to recovery was 121,876 (78,218)/μL of blood. Treatment comprised monitoring/spontaneous recovery (n = 52, 64.2%) or platelet transfusion (n = 9, 11.1%), immunoglobulins (n = 8, 9.9%), or a combination of both (n = 12, 14.8%). Neonates with a higher gestational age (β = 8061, t = 2.456) and late disease onset (β = 26,178, t = 3.969) were more likely to have a larger increase in platelet count from onset to recovery than those with a lower gestational age (adjusted P = .017) and earlier disease onset (adjusted P &lt; .001). Implications: The high incidence of neonatal thrombocytopenia in this Middle Eastern setting indicates that it may be dependent on the population studied. Special attention should be focused on neonates of lower gestational ages and with an early disease onset, because their platelet count recovery may be slower than that of the countergroup.",

Measuring the pH of EFT aspirate is a recommended method to evaluate EFT placement. A pH value of ≤5.5 is considered predictive of gastric placement. Using this method in infants has been questioned. It is unclear whether infants can produce adequate gastric acid to achieve a pH 5 or less and whether feedings and medications influence pH.To report EFT aspirate pH values in infants and to evaluate factors potentially influencing pH values.A retrospective descriptive study was conducted with 1024 infants with 6979 pH values. Demographic and clinical data were collected including type of EFT, pH of gastric aspirate, feeding method, time of last feeding, and administration of acid suppression medications. The frequency of measured pH values of 5 or less was calculated for each covariate.The majority (97.51%) of pH values were 5 or less. Orogastric tubes, continuous feeding, a 4-hour or more feeding interval, exposure to medications (proton pump inhibitor, histamine-2 receptor antagonist, or multiple medications) were associated with an increased likelihood of pH values of more than 5. However, with each study variable the majority of pH values were 5 or less.These findings suggest EFT pH, a recommended method to evaluate the likelihood of gastric placement, can be successfully used in the neonatal population.Future research should prospectively evaluate EFT pH in infants when compared with clinically indicated radiographs. Other factors that might influence pH should be explored including severity of illness, feeding type, and other medications.",

Participants were infants with a primary diagnosis of myelomeningocele between 2013 and 2016. The electronic health record was used to collect descriptive data (demographics and daily enteral feeding exposure).

The majority (n = 144/182, 79.1%) of the study cohort was exposed to mothers' own human milk as their first feed. It is also notable that 80.8% (n = 147) fed at least once directly at the breast; however, infants were also fed by bottle or by feeding tube.It demonstrates that with appropriate evidence-based breastfeeding interventions, mothers having infants with myelomeningocele can expect to feed their infants human milk as well as direct breastfeed.Future research should focus on human milk/breastfeeding outcomes of infants with myelomeningocele post-hospital discharge. Long-term breastfeeding may have an important role in the development of infants with myelomeningocele.",

    "abstract": "Background: Adequate human milk nutrition is critical for infant growth and neurodevelopment; however, low milk transfer volumes are common when establishing preterm breastfeeding. Despite clinical assessments of milk transfer volumes at the breast being inaccurate, measurement of feed volume via test weighing is rarely carried out either routinely or in cases where infant weight gain is inadequate. Purpose: To assess the accuracy of the Preterm Breastfeeding Assessment Tool (PBAT) in determining transfer volumes and examine factors associated with PBAT accuracy. Methods: Pre/postfeed weights were performed using electronic scales and PBAT scores recorded for 1186 breastfeeds in 60 preterm infants born less than 33/40 and 33 to 39/40 postmenstrual age. Measured milk intake volumes were converted to percent prescribed feed volume and compared with PBAT estimates of milk transfer. Results: The PBAT is accurate in identifying when no milk is transferred at the breast but not in estimating transfer of half or the full prescribed volume (accuracy 26% and 47%, respectively). Wide ranges of transfer volumes (11-75 mL) were observed within and between infants, and for 20% of breastfeeds, no milk was transferred. Preterm Breastfeeding Assessment Tool accuracy decreased with each 1-week increase in birth gestation (odds ratio = 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.71-0.94; P = .004). Implications for Practice: When establishing breastfeeding, test weighing facilitates adequate nutrition by guiding appropriate complementary feeding. For mothers breastfeeding several times per day in preparation for discharge home, test weighing may offer a useful tool for developing maternal confidence in assessing milk transfer. Preterm Breastfeeding Assessment Tool is inaccurate in assessing preterm infants' milk transfer volumes when breastfeeding. Implications for Research: While studies have typically focused on medically stable infants, test weighing offers a useful tool to examine breastfeeding efficacy and inform nutritional management of preterm infants with complications such as chronic lung and cardiac disease.",

The incidence of NAIT is 1 in every 1000 live births within the United States; it is the most common cause of severe thrombocytopenia (&lt;30 × 10 9 /L) and intracranial hemorrhage in term newborns. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to discuss the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of NAIT and its implications upon the lifespan of the neonate. Methods: A literature review was conducted using PubMed, CINAHL, and Google Scholar (2014-2019). Search terms included NAIT, neonatal/fetal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, newborn platelets, and intracranial bleeding and NAIT. Results: NAIT can affect first pregnancies and often goes undiagnosed until delivery. Universal screening tools with a focus on HPA-1a typing via noninvasive testing have been successfully trialed and have yielded promising results indicating a 75% reduction in risks associated with NAIT; however, none have been incorporated into practice and prophylactic treatment remains unavailable. Implications for Research: Adopting a universal screening tool and prophylaxis for NAIT would allow for early diagnosis and treatment in utero. Implications for Practice: Many healthcare providers are not familiar with NAIT often focusing on other causes of thrombocytopenia as a potential diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Although the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend obtaining temperature in newborn infants via the axilla, controversy still exists whether to obtain rectal or axillary temperatures. Of concern is the risk of perforating the rectum or colon during rectal temperature-taking. The purpose of this study was to explore the accuracy of electronic thermometer measuring temperature in the axilla compared with the rectum in full-term newborn infants.This was an agreement study involving a purposive sample of newborn infants who were greater than 37 weeks' gestation. The general care nursery was located in a large, urban Midwestern academic medical center, and data collection occurred between May 2010 and August 2010.On admission to the general care nursery, both axillary and rectal temperatures were taken using the FasTemp device by Filac Electronic. Axillary temperatures were taken first, followed immediately by rectal temperature. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlations, and scatter plots were computed.In 69 newborns, the mean difference between rectal and left axilla temperatures was 0.23°C. There was a significant correlation between rectal temperature and the body temperature for the left axilla (r = 0.786; P = .01).These preliminary data support the use of left axillary temperature measurement in the full-term newborn infant in the first few days of life to provide a safe and accurate alternative to rectal temperatures.Nurses caring for newborn infants now have evidence showing that temperature-taking in the left axilla is an alternative to using rectal temperatures, possibly minimizing discomfort and potential risk of perforation.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were to examine nurses' perception of feeding temperature practices and to compare the nurses' temperature estimation with the measured temperature of milk at the time of delivery to the infant. DESIGN: A descriptive exploratory study was conducted in 3 level III neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). SUBJECTS: A convenience sample of nurses from 3 level III NICUs in the Midwest. In addition, temperatures from bottle/syringe samples of formula/breast milk were measured and recorded. METHODS: The Feeding Practices and Temperature Survey, a 10-item survey measuring nurses' perception of the effect of feeding temperature on infant condition, was distributed to subjects. Afterward for select feedings, researchers recorded the type of milk, delivery method, nurses' estimated temperature of the milk, and the measured infrared temperature of milk just before feeding delivery. To compare perception with actual practice patterns, the measured milk temperature was compared with the nurses' estimated temperature, standard room temperature, and body temperature using descriptive statistics of the survey responses and t test comparisons. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES/PRINCIPAL RESULTS: A total of 141 surveys were analyzed. More than 50% of respondents reported feeding temperature as clinically very significant. A range of 35.5°C to 37.2°C was reported as the ideal temperature of breast milk at delivery. Recordings of 419 temperatures were used for analysis. Measured milk temperature just before feeding ranged from 22°C to 46.4°C. The mean measured temperatures were 31.0°C (SD = 2.8°C) for warmed milk in a bottle and 30.5°C (SD = 2.5°C) for milk warmed in a syringe. The measured milk temperature and the nurse-estimated temperature were significantly lower than body temperature (P = 0.000) and significantly higher than room temperature (P = 0.000). CONCLUSION: Current warming methods yield wide variation in milk temperature. Nurses' estimation of milk temperature was not consistent with measured temperature at the time of delivery. Future research is needed to establish guidelines for feeding temperature standardization assisting nurses to enhance evidence-based feeding practices.",

The aim was to assess nurses' knowledge of the protocol and nurses' adherence to the protocol documentation before and after the education module was implemented.Registered nurses working in the birthing center who completed the online knowledge tests and an education module.A repeated-measures quality improvement study was conducted to assess nurses' knowledge of the evidence supporting CCHD screening by pulse oximetry and adherence to the correct documentation of the screening protocol before, immediately after, and 3 months following participation in an online education module.Nurses' knowledge of the CCHD screening protocol was determined by the number of correct answers on a 10-item online test administered before and after the education module. Adherence to correct documentation of the protocol before and after the education intervention was evaluated. The medical charts of 300 newborns delivered at the center with pulse oximetry readings performed after 24 hours of age and before discharge were randomly selected and reviewed.A significant improvement in knowledge test scores was observed immediately after the education module (9.1 ± 1.0), relative to baseline (8.4 ± 1.2; paired t = 3.02, P = .0046). A significant increase in knowledge test scores measured at baseline, immediately after, and 3 months postintervention was also indicated (F = 3.25; df = 2, 24; P = .0564). Documentation of the protocol in the medical charts for the location of the readings significantly improved after the educational intervention (right hand: 28%, 83%, and 90%; right foot: 27%, 82%, and 89%; both P < .0001).Providing education to staff before implementing new practice changes enhances their knowledge. Quality improvement monitoring is recommended to ensure nursing adherence to any practice change.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral intravenous (PIV) infiltrations causing tissue damage is a global issue surrounded by situations that make vascular access decisions difficult. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to develop an algorithm and assess its effectiveness in reducing PIV infiltrations in neonates. The targeted subjects were all infants in our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) with a PIV catheter. We completed a retrospective chart review of the electronic medical record to collect 4th quarter 2012 baseline data. Following adoption of the algorithm, we also performed a daily manual count of all PIV catheters in the 1st and 2nd quarters 2013. Daily PIV days were defined as follows: 1 patient with a PIV catheter equals 1 PIV day. An infant with 2 PIV catheters in place was counted as 2 PIV days. Our rate of infiltration or tissue damage was determined by counting the number of events and dividing by the number of PIV days. The rate of infiltration or tissue damage was reported as the number of events per 100 PIV days. The number of infiltrations and PIV catheters was collected from the electronic medical record and also verified manually by daily assessment after adoption of the algorithm. To reduce the rate of PIV infiltrations leading to grade 4 infiltration and tissue damage by at least 30% in the NICU population. Incidence of PIV infiltrations/100 catheter days. The baseline rate for total infiltrations increased slightly from 5.4 to 5.68/100 PIV days (P = .397) for the NICU. We attributed this increase to heightened awareness and better reporting. Grade 4 infiltrations decreased from 2.8 to 0.83/100 PIV catheter days (P = .00021) after the algorithm was implemented. Tissue damage also decreased from 0.68 to 0.3/100 PIV days (P = .11). Statistical analysis used the Fisher exact test and reported as statistically significant at P < .05. Our findings suggest that utilization of our standardized decision pathway was instrumental in providing guidance for problem solving related to vascular access decisions. We feel this contributed to the overall reduction in grade 4 intravenous infiltration and tissue damage rates. Grade 4 infiltration reductions were highly statistically significant (P = .00021).",

    "abstract": "The National Association of Neonatal Nurses (NANN) is committed to efficient, equitable, safe, accountable, and high-quality patient care. As the professional voice of neonatal nurses, NANN recognizes the limitations of current evidence regarding staff nurses' shift length and fatigue and patient outcomes as well as the vulnerability of neonatal nurses to the potential risks of fatigue and sleep disturbances. The revised statement recommends that neonatal nurses and their employers implement a combination of countermeasures to minimize personal and patient safety risks as they relate to fatigue, shift length, and overtime. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE The relationship between working long shifts and safety outcomes is complex and may be influenced by several factors, including patient acuity, workload, type of shift, and how effectively fatigue is managed. Current evidence regarding effects of working long shifts on nurse performance, cognitive functioning, and patient outcomes is inconclusive. However, evidence points to a link between long shifts and suboptimal patient outcomes and healthcare errors.1–3 Currently, there are no effective measures that can completely eliminate the negative effects of working long shifts and there are no clear guidelines to inform neonatal nurse administrators and staff nurses about how to manage shift length and overtime. NEW CHANGES Research on nursing work-related fatigue clearly identifies the need to protect both patients and nurses from work-related fatigue and sleep deprivation. This position statement is aimed at highlighting risk-reduction strategies to address nurses' work-related fatigue and mitigate risks that are associated with working long shifts. Strategies include: Working no more than 12 hours per day (12 hours plus 30 minutes for lunch break) and working no more than 48 hours per week Limiting the number of consecutive 12-hour shifts to three per week Having a minimum of two rest days after three consecutive 12-hour shifts, four 10-hour shifts, or five 8-hour shifts Encouraging staff to take a minimum of one 10- to 15-minute break for every 4 hours worked and at least a 20-minute meal or rest break when working 6 hours or more Incorporating education about fatigue into nursing curricula/orientation Several factors at the system, unit, and individual levels influence the prevalence and intensity of work-related fatigue. Preventing work-related fatigue and consequences require a multifaceted approach toward individual lifestyle changes, workplace culture, and organizational policies. Employers must implement guidelines to minimize work-related fatigue and promote a culture that recognizes nursing fatigue as an unacceptable risk. It should also be recognized that there may be exceptions that necessitate a staff nurse to remain on duty for longer hours (eg, severe weather). CONCLUSION Nurses are responsible for independent judgment related to patient care and treatment. It is imperative that nurses monitor their own fatigue levels. Nurses must be aware of factors that influence prevalence and intensity of work-related fatigue and take actions to modify those factors. Employers must create a culture that recognizes the effect of nursing fatigue on patient outcomes and nursing performance.",

Risk for these SUID and SIDS is affected by a combination of nonmodifiable intrinsic risk factors and modifiable extrinsic stressors including infant care practices related to sleep. Although adherence to the full scope of American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 2011 recommendations is intended to decrease risk, these recommendations are aimed at singleton infants and may require tailoring for families with multiple infants.The study describes infant care practices reported by mothers of twins in the first 6 months postpartum.Mothers caring for twin infants (N = 35) were surveyed online both longitudinally (at 2, 8, 16, and 24 weeks after infant hospital discharge) and cross-sectionally. AAP recommendations (2011) guided survey content.The degree of adherence to AAP recommendations varied over time. For example, mothers of twins reported 100% adherence to placing twins supine for sleep initially, but many reported putting babies on their stomachs for naps as twins became older. Sharing a parent's bedroom decreased over time as did frequency of crib sharing. Fewer than half of mothers offered a pacifier most or all of the time for sleep.Opportunities exist for development of an educational program geared specifically for postpartum parents of twins.Barriers affecting adherence to AAP recommendations and effectiveness of educational programs addressing needs of this unique population need further exploration.",

The recommended initial line of treatment to alleviate NAS symptoms includes nonpharmacologic interventions; however, there is little rigorous evidence on the effectiveness of nonpharmacologic interventions. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess the safety, feasibility, and effectiveness of weighted blankets in the care of NAS infants. Methods: This pilot study was a crossover randomized nonblinded controlled trial conducted at a level III neonatal intensive care unit. Infants' care included 30-minute sessions utilizing either a nonweighted or weighted blanket, with infants serving as their own controls. Results: A total of 16 patients were enrolled for a total of 67 weighted blanket sessions. To address safety, no adverse events were observed, the weighted blankets were never removed due to infant distress, and infants experienced no significant temperature change. To address feasibility, 94% of approached mothers were receptive to the use of weighted blankets and staff reported no obstacles to using the blanket. Finally, to assess effectiveness, there was a significant decrease in the infant's heart rate and Finnegan score when a weighted blanket was used. There was no significant change in respiratory rate with the use of a weighted blanket. Implications for Practice: Weighted blankets may be safe, feasible, and effective in decreasing NAS symptoms. Implications for Research: Larger studies are needed to thoroughly study the use of weighted blankets in this population and examine additional outcomes, such as need for pharmacologic intervention, length of hospital stay, and cost of hospital stay.",

    "abstract": "Developmentally supportive environments are known to improve medical outcomes for hospitalized neonates and are considered the overarching philosophy for practice in the neonatal setting. Developmental rounds are a strategy incorporated by multidisciplinary teams to support development within and beyond the neonatal unit. Typically, they consist of bedside consultations and individualized developmentally supportive recommendations for families and clinicians. Globally, the use of developmental rounds has been described since the early 1990s. They are viewed as a measure to counter some of the barriers to developmental care implementation while buffering against the effect of an intensive care admission. To date, their use in the surgical neonatal intensive care unit (sNICU) has been minimally reported in literature.This article describes the focus and work of a developmental round team and strategy in the sNICU.A retrospective audit of developmental round key performance criteria undertaken over a 4-year period (2015-2018).More than 300 developmental consults and 2000 individualized developmental recommendations occurred annually. Parental presence during the developmental round increased by 10%, from 48% to 58%, during the audit period.Literature has supported the use of developmental round interventions; however, minimal data have been reported to date. This article provides retrospective audit data of a developmental round intervention in the sNICU with a focus on data over 4 years to highlight key areas, including the structure and process, recommended educational standards for team members, and parental engagement, as key markers for developmental round efficacy. Future research should focus on the link between the developmental round intervention and long-term neonatal outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Background: Parenting confidence is an important factor in fostering optimal health and development of infants with medical complexity. However, our understanding of how parents of medically complex infants describe development of confidence is limited. The purpose of this mixed-methods study was to describe the nature and development of parenting confidence. Methods: A mixed-method design was used to examine how parents described their level of confidence. Ten parents of infants with medical complexity. Quantitative measures provided patterns of confidence and qualitative data focused on parent descriptions of confidence. Parents completed online surveys at 3 time points: (1) study enrollment, (2) infant discharge from hospital, and (3) 3 months after discharge. Parents were purposively sampled, using their confidence patterns, for qualitative phone interviews. Results: Our analysis of quantitative findings revealed 3 confidence patterns: (1) increasing, (2) stable, and (3) varying. Parents described their confidence as either (1) a state of being confident or (2) how they behaved in the parenting role. Parents felt both certain and uncertain in their level of confidence and described confidence as being situationally dependent. Implications for Practice: Parenting confidence needs to be cultivated through encouragement and repeated exposure to parenting behaviors. Nurses are well-suited to help identify parents with low confidence to support parents so that they can develop confidence. Implications for Research: Because there is variability in parent confidence during this critical early period of life, future research should consider a larger cohort of parents that compares confidence in diverse parent groups (ie, married vs living together couples, same-sex couples, and single parents). Research should also examine effective strategies to promote confidence and associated long-term health and developmental outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Background: Dyadic synchrony is a co-constructed social process relating to the back and forth interactions between mothers and infants that are strongly associated with neurodevelopment, self-regulation, and attachment. In the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), this process may become interrupted because of the physiological state of the infant, the emotional state of the mother, and the physical environment of the NICU. Purpose: In applying Feldman's Biobehavioral Model of Synchrony, this empirical review deconstructs the process of dyadic synchrony in the NICU context and provides a conceptual approach to guide both research and clinical practice. Methods: First, we examine the theoretical and empirical literature to explicate the primary structural and biophysiological components of synchrony and relate these constructs to the extant research on premature infants. Next, we synthesize the maternal, infant, and contextual factors that facilitate or inhibit the ontogenesis of dyadic synchrony in the NICU. The final section highlights the state of the science in dyadic synchrony in the NICU including gaps and recommendations for future research. Findings: An empirical review synthesis presents a visual conceptual framework to illustrate multiple processes that depict maternal, infant, and contextual influences of mother–infant synchrony in the NICU. Implications for Practice/Research: Despite the challenges posed to mother–infant relationships in the NICU, high-quality mother–infant interactions are possible, dyadic synchrony can emerge, and premature infants can develop secure attachments. Clinicians and researchers can apply this conceptual framework of mother–infant dyadic synchrony in the NICU to promote evidence-based research and clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Mother's own milk improves health outcomes in infants of all gestational ages. Although pump-dependent mothers of extremely premature infants are at risk of insufficient milk production, whether mother's milk production is impacted by gestational age and pump dependency in mothers of more mature critically ill infants is unknown.To determine whether there is a relationship between gestational age, milk production, and time to secretory activation in mothers delivering a critically ill infant.A convenience sample of 136 pump-dependent mothers whose infants were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit was enrolled between 2013 and 2016 as part of a quality improvement project. Group 1 (early preterm) delivered infants at 30 to 33 weeks of gestation (n = 41), group 2 (late preterm) 34 to 36 weeks (n = 48), and group 3 (term) 37 weeks and more (n = 47). Milk volume on days 1 to 7 was measured by weighing each vial of expressed milk and compared using general linear mixed-model analysis. Time to the onset of secretory activation was compared using censored regression analysis.Main effect for gestational age controlling for day was statistically significant (P = .0234). The early preterm group produced more milk over the 7-day study than the term (P = .01) and late preterm (P = .02) groups. The early preterm group achieved secretory activation earlier than the late preterm group (adjusted P = .039).Pump-dependent mothers of all infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit may be at risk of inadequate milk production and delayed secretory activation and may therefore benefit from early milk production monitoring and lactation support.Further studies should examine targeted interventions to increase milk production in pump-dependent mothers.",

    "abstract": "Background: Neonates in need of intensive care are often subjected to numerous painful procedures. Despite the growing scientific research, hospitalized neonates continue to experience unrelieved pain. Enhancing the competence of neonatal intensive care nurses is an integral component of effective pain management. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to identify and synthesize the existing evidence on nurses' and midwives' competence regarding neonatal pain management internationally. Methods/Search Strategy: The review was guided by Whittemore and Knafl's 5-stage framework, with 8 databases searched in June 2020 including PubMed, CINAHL Complete (via EBSCOhost), MEDLINE (via EBSCOhost), PsycINFO (via Ovid), EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. Reference lists of selected articles were also hand-searched. Studies were reviewed independently for methodology and inclusion and exclusion criteria. The initial search yielded 3037 articles; 19 met the inclusion criteria and were included for analysis: qualitative (n = 5) and quantitative (n = 14). Findings/Results: Nurses' and midwives' competence regarding neonatal pain management in the neonatal intensive care unit is discussed in relation to knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, and perceptions of competence by most studies. The barriers to effective neonatal pain management were found to relate to nurses' and midwives' factors, underutilized pain assessment tools, and organizational factors. Potential facilitators to effective neonatal pain management included clear evidence-based guidelines/protocols, adequate training, and the use of appropriate and accurate pain assessment tools. Parent involvement and a team approach to neonatal pain management were also identified. Implications for Practice and Research: These findings suggest that further research is necessary to address the barriers and promote facilitators to improve neonatal pain management.",

    "abstract": "Background/Significance: The pain-reducing effect of applying vibration, which is used as a nonpharmacological method in pain management, is explained by the gate control theory developed by Melzack and Wall. Studies that are based on this theory have shown similar results to those of Melzack and Wall, indicating that pain-transmitting nerves are suppressed by vibrations, leading to higher pain thresholds. Purpose: The study aimed to evaluate the effect of applying vibration to manage pain during heel lance procedures in newborns. Methods: This is a randomized, controlled experimental study. The study sample included 56 newborns determined using power analysis (vibration group = 28; control group = 28). For those in the vibration group, a vibrating device was used for approximately 30 seconds before the heel lance procedure and then continued throughout the procedure. No interventions were provided to the newborns in the control group. Pain in the newborns was evaluated by the nurse who performed the heel lance procedures, before the procedures and 15 to 20 seconds and 5 minutes after procedures, and by 2 specialists who viewed the video footage and conducted the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale examination. Results: The pain scores were significantly lower at 15 to 20 seconds and 5 minutes after the heel lance procedures in the group that received vibrations than in the control group ( P &lt; .05). Implications for Practice: The application of vibration, which is effective, nonpharmacological, and noninvasive, could help nurses manage pain in newborns as a nonpharmacological method. Implications for Research: The number of studies that examine the effect that vibration has on pain associated with heel lance procedures in newborns is very limited, and it is recommended that further studies be conducted with larger sample sizes.",

There is significant evidence to support that mentoring positively impacts nurse practitioners' job satisfaction and retention. However, there is a lack of evidence-based literature specific to NNP mentoring.Determine the impact of participation in the NANNP formalized mentoring program on job satisfaction and retention for novice and experienced NNPs in an academic medical center in Tennessee.This quality improvement project utilized a secure online survey that included the Misener Nurse Practitioner Job Satisfaction Scale (MNPJSS) and 2 intent-to-stay items prior to implementation of a 6-month mentoring program. Neonatal intensive care unit nurse practitioners completed the same electronic survey at 3 intervals after program implementation to determine the impact of the mentoring program on job satisfaction and intent to stay.Project results identified a significant difference in MNPJSS scores for participants in a 6-month formal mentoring program using the NANNP tool kit. The MNPJSS scores moderately correlated with intent to stay at 1 year and strongly correlated with intent to stay at 3 years.The results of this project support the positive impact of a formalized mentoring program on job satisfaction for new graduate nurse practitioners. Recognizing the challenge to recruit and retain NNPs, organizations should explore creative solutions to develop and support formalized mentoring programs.Further research is warranted to validate use of the NANNP tool kit in the establishment and evaluation of a formalized mentoring program.Video abstract available at:https://journals.lww.com/advancesinneonatalcare/Pages/videogallery.aspx .",

    "abstract": "While various feeding strategies designed to optimize growth have been investigated and used in the clinical setting, the problem of not being able to recognize the warning signs of feeding intolerance early enough to prevent serious gastrointestinal complication commonly associated with very low birth-weight (VLBW) preterm infant remains. Currently, early stages of feeding intolerance are most often identified though nurse assessments. Additional methods to predict feeding intolerance in this population are needed. Currently, intra-abdominal pressure monitoring has been an effective method to predict intolerance to enteral nutrition in the adult and pediatric populations.There is supportive evidence for the use of noninvasive methods, such as nasogastric tubes, to effectively monitor IAP. While this may not be the gold standard method of using Foley catheters for measurement, it could provide predictive levels that are indicative of progression toward bowel inflammation.This review shows the potential for using noninvasive nasogastric tubes for monitoring intra-abdominal pressure and may provide direction for evaluating intra-abdominal pressures in VLBW preterm infants as a reliable method for early identification of feeding intolerance.The use of nasogastric tubes to monitor intra-abdominal pressure may provide an effective noninvasive tool to identify VLBW preterm infants progressing toward feeding intolerance and would add to assessment data.Development and testing of a reliable nasogastric tube monitoring device in the VLBW preterm infant population and identify predictive levels that indicate progression toward feeding intolerance is needed. Once IAP predictive levels are identified, provider interventions could be developed.",

Staphylococcus aureus (SA), a common skin pathogen, remains the second leading cause of late-onset sepsis in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a resistant strain of SA, has created a significant global communicable health risk, especially in the NICU.To examine evidence related to NICU infection control practices surrounding MRSA surveillance, identification, and isolation in response to the clinical question, \"What strategies should be universally implemented in the NICU to identify and prevent the spread of MRSA?\"Databases were examined for articles on the topical area of MRSA in the neonate. Key terms were used to streamline the search, resulting in 20 primary works and 3 guideline/consensus statements considered imperative in response to the clinical questions.Hand hygiene remains the cornerstone to sound infection control practice. Colonization often leads to systemic infection, with smaller neonates at greatest risk. Hospital infection control compliance has improved outcomes. MRSA surveillance has reduced horizontal spread. No universal, specific recommendations exist to guide surveillance and management of MRSA in the NICU.Standardized guidelines with procedures for hand hygiene, patient surveillance and isolation, and patient cohorting with recommended staffing patterns should guide practice in the NICU. Both MRSA culture and polymerase chain reaction effectively identify positive patients. Decolonization practices are not yet clear.Evaluation of standard isolation practices versus outbreak response and approaches to neonatal decolonization should be evaluated for efficacy, safety, and resistance.",

An evidence-based algorithm for prevention and treatment of diaper dermatitis was developed and introduced in a level IV neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Two cases are discussed as examples of severe diaper dermatitis. The first case demonstrates the final case of severe diaper dermatitis since the introduction of the algorithm. The second case demonstrates a less severe, but equally frustrating, case of diaper dermatitis that occurred after the practice of using the algorithm was established. The need for consistency in the prevention and treatment of diaper dermatitis is paramount to providing quality care. There are a number of points within the bedside care regimen where breakdown in consistency occurs. The adherence to consistent and evidence-based treatment regimens has the potential to decrease the incidence and severity of diaper dermatitis in high-risk hospitalized infants. Initiation of an evidence-based algorithm to assist in the prevention and treatment of diaper dermatitis can be supported by data of the number of cases of diaper dermatitis collected before and after implementing the algorithm. The information can further assist in continued education and pursuance of investigation of other major skin injuries in NICU patients. The importance surrounding infant skin care and building awareness surrounding all of the facets of skin care in this vulnerable population demonstrate the benefits to quality outcomes and care.",

The Neonatal Pain, Agitation, and Sedation Scale (N-PASS) and the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) are valid measures of pain. The N-PASS also provides a sedation subscale. Purpose: The objective of this study was to determine N-PASS clinical validity and utility by evaluating agreement of N-PASS scores with bedside nurses' assessments of pain/agitation and sedation in a 64-bed tertiary neonatal intensive care unit. Methods: Fifteen bedside nurses trained to use the N-PASS and the NIPS prospectively completed 202 pain/agitation and sedation assessments from a convenience sample of 88 infants, including chronically ventilated, medically fragile infants. N-PASS and NIPS scores were obtained simultaneously but independently of nurse investigators. Bedside nurses also made recommendations about infants' pain and sedation management. Results: There was moderate agreement between N-PASS pain scores and nurses' recommendations (κ= 0.52), very strong agreement between N-PASS sedation scores and nurses' recommendations (κ= 0.99), and very strong associations between N-PASS pain and NIPS scores ( P &lt; .001). Bedside nurse and independent investigator interrater reliability was good for N-PASS pain and NIPS scores (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.83, ICC = 0.85) and excellent for N-PASS sedation (ICC = 0.94). During 93% of assessments, bedside nurses reported that the N-PASS reflected the level of infant sedation well or very well. Implications for Practice and Research: The N-PASS provides an easy-to-use, valid, and reliable objective measure of pain and sedation that reflects nurses' assessments. Additional studies using the N-PASS are needed to verify results and the influence of the N-PASS on pain and sedation management for medically fragile infants with chronic medical conditions.",

Purpose: This study aims to explore the current state of noise and possible solutions in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in Konya, Turkey. Methods: In 2021, a descriptive exploratory study was conducted with a qualitative content analysis approach. Eighteen nurses, three physicians, seven staff members, and four mothers were selected to participate in the study via purposeful sampling. The data were collected from two semi-structured interviews, six focus groups, six observations, and sound source level measurements using a sound decibel meter. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyze the data. Results: Three main themes and seven major categories emerged from the data analysis. The themes were overt and covert sources, pan-negative effects , and holistic modification . All recorded sound levels exceeded the recommended noise level of 45 dB. Fifty-seven percent of sound sources were in the range of 45–65 dB, and 43% were higher than 65 dB. Implications for Practice and Research: This study showed that NICU has a noisy environment with hidden sound sources that can negatively affect all people. This situation must be approached seriously by holistic modification involving environmental modification, behavioral modification, and resource management. It highlighted that each environment is unique and needs to be carefully evaluated to find a suitable and cost-effective solution.",

    "abstract": "Background: The opportunity to establish a direct breastfeeding (DBF) relationship with a preterm infant, if desired by the mother or lactating parent, is a known driver of positive healthcare experiences. Preterm birth is an independent risk factor for early human milk (HM) cessation, and DBF at the first oral meal promotes continued DBF during hospitalization and HM duration beyond discharge. While the Spatz 10-step model for protecting and promoting HM and breastfeeding in vulnerable infants provides best practices, lack of standardized implementation results in missed opportunities to meet parents' DBF goals. Purpose: To standardize clinical practices to increase DBF at the first oral meal, total DBF meals during hospitalization, and use of test weighing to measure milk transfer for preterm infants. Methods: Quality improvement methods were used to develop and implement Encourage, Assess, Transition (EAT): a DBF protocol for infants less than 37 weeks gestation at birth, in a level II neonatal intensive care unit. Results: Thirty-eight (45%) infants from 27.7 to 36.7 weeks of gestation initiated the protocol. The proportion of infants' DBF at first oral meal increased from 22% to 54%; mean DBF meals during hospitalization increased from 13.3 to 20.3; and use of test weighing increased by 166%. Implications for Practice and Research: Standardizing DBF practices with the EAT protocol increased DBF during hospitalization—a known driver of patient experience—and HM duration beyond discharge, in hospitalized preterm infants. Researchers should validate the reported benefits of EAT (increased DBF during hospitalization, use of test weighing, and improved patient experience), methods to promote passive dissemination of evidence, and sustain change.

These efforts have included reconfiguring units to provide private rooms for infants. Purpose: The purpose of this integrative review was to synthesize and critically analyze negative outcomes for patients, families, and staff who have been identified in the literature related to single-family room (SFR) care in the neonatal intensive care unit. Methods/Search Strategy: The electronic databases of CINAHL, ProQuest Nursing &amp; Allied Health, and PubMed databases were utilized. Inclusion criteria were research studies in English, conducted from 2011 to 2021, in which the focus of the study was related to unit design (SFRs). Based on the inclusion criteria, our search yielded 202 articles, with an additional 2 articles found through reference list searches. After screening, 44 articles met our full inclusion/exclusion criteria. These studies were examined for outcomes related to SFR unit design. Findings/Results: Our findings revealed both positive and negative outcomes related to SFR unit design when compared with traditional open bay units. These outcomes were grouped into 4 domains: Environmental Outcomes, Infant Outcomes, Parent Outcomes, and Staff Outcomes. Implications for Practice and Research: Although SFR neonatal intensive care unit design improves some outcomes for infants, families, and staff, some unexpected outcomes have been identified. Although these do not negate the positive outcomes, they should be recognized so that steps can be taken to address potential issues and prevent undesired outcomes.",

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends maintaining a noise level of less than 45 decibels (dBA). The average baseline noise level in an open-pod neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) was 62.6 dBA. Purpose: The purpose of this pilot project was to reduce the average noise levels by 39% at the end of an 11-week period. Methods: The location of the project was in a large, high-acuity level IV open-pod layout NICU that consisted of 4 pods, one of which was cardiac-focused. The average baseline noise level in the cardiac pod was 62.6 dBA in a 24-hour period. Noise levels were not monitored before this pilot project. This project was implemented over an 11-week period. Several modes of education were used for parents and staff. Post-education, Quiet Times were implemented at set times twice daily. Noise levels were monitored for 4 weeks during Quiet Times, with weekly noise level updates for staff. General noise levels were collected a final time to evaluate the overall change in the average noise levels. Results: At the end of the project, noise levels decreased from 62.6 dBA to 54 dBA, a 13.7% reduction. Implications for Practice and Research: At the end of this pilot project it was noted that: Online modules were the best way to educate staff. Parents should be included in the implementation of quality improvement. Healthcare providers need to know and understand that they can make preventative changes to improve the outcomes of the population.",

    "abstract": "Background: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) risk has been shown to arise from multiple sources and risk awareness may be supported using bedside tools. Purpose: The purpose of this research was to examine the extent to which GutCheck NEC was associated with scores for clinical deterioration, severity of illness, and clinical outcome, and further to examine how scores might improve NEC prediction. Methods: A retrospective, correlational case-control study with infant data from 3 affiliated neonatal intensive care units was conducted. Results: Of 132 infants (44 cases, 88 controls), most were 28 weeks of gestation at birth and less (74%). Median age at NEC onset was 18 days (range: 6-34 days), with two-thirds diagnosed before 21 days. At 68 hours of life, higher GutCheck NEC scores were associated with NEC requiring surgery or resulting in death (relative risk ratio [RRR] = 1.06, P = .036), associations that persisted at 24 hours prior to diagnosis (RRR = 1.05, P = .046), and at the time of diagnosis (RRR = 1.05, P = .022) but showed no associations for medical NEC. GutCheck NEC scores were significantly correlated with pediatric early warning scores (PEWS) ( r &gt; 0.30; P &lt; .005) and SNAPPE-II scores ( r &gt; 0.44, P &lt; .0001). Increasing numbers of clinical signs and symptoms were positively associated with GutCheck NEC and PEWS at the time of diagnosis ( r = 0.19, P = .026; and r = 0.25, P = .005, respectively). Implications for Practice and Research: GutCheck NEC provides structure to streamline assessment and communication about NEC risk. Yet, it is not intended to be diagnostic. Research is needed on how GutCheck NEC impacts timely recognition and treatment.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The need for paternal support is rarely addressed in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Neonatal nurses often primarily focus on the needs of the mother and infant and may not be trained in support of fathers. PURPOSE: To investigate nurses' self-efficacy (SE) in guiding and supporting fathers after implementing a father-friendly NICU. METHODS: Nurses from the intervention NICU and 13 control NICUs were included in a before-and-after intervention study. Questionnaires measuring nurses' SE regarding support of fathers and mothers were obtained when starting the development process, before and 18 months after the implementation. The primary outcome was the difference between nurses' SE scores for father and mother questions in the intervention group compared with the control group. RESULTS: In total, 294, 330, and 288 nurses responded to the first, second, and third questionnaires, respectively. From the first to third questionnaires, the intervention group showed a significantly higher increase in SE scores for father questions compared with the control group (0.53 vs 0.20, P = .005) and a nonsignificantly higher increase for mother questions (0.30 vs 0.09, P = .13). In the third questionnaire, the intervention group showed a higher SE score for father questions compared with the control group (9.02 vs 8.45, P = .002) and the first questionnaire (9.02 vs 8.49, P = .02). IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND RESEARCH: By implementing a father-friendly NICU, nurses' SE for providing support to fathers increased significantly. Training in a father-friendly approach increases nurses' ability to support both parents.",

    "abstract": "Background: Although research has demonstrated positive impacts of family-centered care (FCC), many neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) nurses hesitate to fully engage in its practice. There has been little scientific focus on investigating the challenges of FCC implementation in the NICU setting. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to generate a grounded theory explaining the process by which neonatal nurses experience facilitators and challenges through engaging in FCC practices in the context of the NICU setting. Methods: This qualitative, grounded theory portion of a mixed-methods study employed individual, semistructured, video-based dyadic interviews with 20 neonatal nurses. Results: Successful implementation of FCC by neonatal nurses is affected by various factors. The adage that “it takes a village to raise a child” described this process for the nurse participants. The delivery of FCC involves respectful engagement and participation by multiple internal and external stakeholders. The process of delivering FCC was influenced by factors across 6 categories: equitable relationships, bond of trust, knowledge sharing, empowerment in workplace, environment and culture, and regulations. The findings suggest that FCC implementation is not an individual initiative; rather, it involves a complex set of interrelationships between care team members. NICU nurses may consider these findings when they are proposing a change to a FCC model. Implications for Practice and Research: Flexibility is necessary by multidisciplinary teams to achieve maximum benefits of FCC and minimize potential harm, despite the unit design. Facilities may support nurses with continuing education programs to expand their FCC knowledge and skills.",

    "abstract": "Background: Capillary blood sampling (heel stick) in infants is commonly performed in neonatal care units. Before the procedure, warming the infant's heel is often a customary practice, but no consensus exists on the most effective heel-warming method. Purpose: To compare the effects of routinely used warming methods (glove, gel pack, or blanket) applied prior to heel stick on blood sample quality and infant's comfort. Methods: This prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit included infants (postmenstrual age of ≥28 + 0 weeks and ≤43 + 6 weeks) who were computer-randomized to 1 of 3 warming methods. The primary outcome was blood flow velocity at sampling. Secondary outcomes were hemolysis index, infant COMFORTneo score, and frequency of postprocedure skin injuries. In addition, irrespective of the warming method used, the correlation between heel skin temperature and postprocedure heel skin injury was analyzed. Results: A total of 176 heel warmings were successfully randomized, and 173 were analyzed. Despite a significant difference in obtained heel skin temperature after warming between the 3 warming methods (P =.001), no difference in blood flow velocity (P =.91), hemolysis index (P =.99), or COMFORTneo score (P =.76) was found. Baseline skin temperatures above 37.0°C were associated with higher incidences of skin injury, and skin temperatures after warming were significantly higher in skin-injured heels (P =.038). Implications for Practice and Research: All 3 warming methods had similar effects on blood sample quality and infant's comfort. However, excessive warming of the heel should be avoided to prevent skin injuries.",

The temporal artery thermometer (TAT) has been recommended for all ages by the manufacturer; however, there is insufficient evidence for the use of TAT in infants, especially to detect hypothermia. Purpose: To assess the accuracy of the TAT in hypothermic neonates in comparison to a rectal thermometer. Methods: This study was a naturalistic, quantitative, and observational study. Temporal artery temperatures (using Exergen TemporalScanner 5000) were compared to rectal temperatures in critically ill infants in the neonatal intensive care unit undergoing therapeutic hypothermia for hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. Temperatures were taken during a 72-hour cooling period at 33.5 °C and a 6-hour rewarming period to normothermia of 36.5 °C. Nineteen patients and 1280 temperature measurements were included in this study. Results: During the cooling period, TAT and rectal temperatures had a weak correlation (r = 0.34, P &lt; .001). The correlation during the rewarming period was much stronger (r = 0.70, P &lt; .001), indicating less variability in measures, but not agreement. On average, regardless of period, the TAT temperatures read 0.43 °C (95% confidence interval, 0.37-0.49, P &lt; .001) warmer than the rectal temperatures. The cooling or warming period had no effect on this difference between temperatures. Implications for Practice and Research: This study found that temperatures obtained with a TAT are generally warmer than the accepted standard core rectal temperature in hypothermic neonates, and we do not recommend its use in critically ill neonates who require accurate temperature readings.",

Purpose: To describe parental and staff perspectives on the quality of FCC culture in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Methods: Parents of hospitalized infants and staff at a referral NICU completed validated survey instruments to measure NICU FCC quality on topics including trust, communication, and shared decision-making at multiple time points. We compared parent and staff responses using a cumulative log-odds model with a single predictor to model the odds of a score lower than a prespecified value. Results: A total of 92 parents of 80 NICU infants and 96 NICU providers participated. Most rated items highly, indicating a positive experience with FCC. The items with the highest scores for parents were receiving guidance and being trusted in their infant’s care (both 97.1% positive); for staff, listening to parents (95%). Receiving/providing emotional support received the lowest scores from parents (19.1% negative or neutral) and staff (24.5%). Parent and staff answers differed significantly for 6 of 8 questions, with lower scores reported by staff relative to parents. Implications for practice and research: Parents and staff have variable perspectives on different aspects of FCC. Understanding these nuances of centers’ FCC culture can help target interventions and may strengthen FCC delivery for NICU infants and families and career satisfaction for staff. Future directions include assessing FCC quality over time and among specific infant, family, and staff cohorts, especially diverse populations to determine if FCC is equitably delivered.",

Maternal involvement in neonatal care significantly reduces pain and stress, thereby supporting better neurodevelopment in neonates. How do maternal involvement strategies reduce neonatal pain and pain-related stress in the NICU? A systematic search was conducted on CENTRAL, PubMed Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest databases, and Google Scholar for studies published between January 2007 and March 2024. A search across 7 databases yielded a total of 1360 studies, which were exported to Rayyan software for screening. Two independent authors conducted the screening based on the eligibility criteria. Cochrane data collection forms were used to extract the data from the included studies. Out of 1360 titles identified during the initial search, a total of 27 randomized controlled trials were eligible and were included. Although there is a slight inconsistency in results, meta-analysis findings revealed that skin-to-skin care, holding, massage, feeding the baby, and maternal voice stimulation, significantly reduce procedural pain and pain-related stress, in neonates admitted to the NICU. Given the consistent results, this systematic review strongly supports NICU healthcare professionals in encouraging mothers to engage in neonatal care activities to reduce procedural pain and related stress. More research is needed, including navigating the mothers on the importance of their involvement in neonatal care throughout the NICU admission and after hospital discharge.",

It addresses critical neonatal care needs by facilitating skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding. Purpose: This meta-analysis evaluates the impact of KMC on growth parameters and neurobehavioral development in preterm infants, while considering evidence quality. Data Sources: Six databases were searched for studies published in English, covering studies up to the year 2024. Additionally, citation tracking was used to identify relevant studies. Study Selection: Out of 953 studies initially identified, 17 studies met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed for the meta-analysis. Data Extraction: Data were abstracted and assessed for quality and validity using standardized guidelines, applied independently by multiple observers. Results: KMC significantly improved the weight, head circumference, and body length of preterm infants. Gestational age was found to influence outcomes: with increasing gestational age, head circumference growth slowed, while body length showed more rapid gains. KMC also demonstrated positive effects on neurodevelopmental and brain growth indicators. Implications for Practice and Research: Clinically, nurses can support parents in initiating and maintaining kangaroo care, helping to enhance parental involvement during the NICU stay. While its benefits for health and neurodevelopment are well-established, further research is needed to explore its application at home. Higher-quality evidence is required to validate these findings and support broader clinical adoption in various healthcare settings.",

Purpose: To evaluate healthcare utilization and costs in the 12-months after a neonatal hospitalization among commercially insured infants, comparing infants with and without medically complex conditions. Methods: This retrospective, cross-sectional, cohort study uses data from the IBM MarketScan Commercial database (2015–2019). The cohort included infants with and without medically complex conditions, hospitalized at birth in the NICU, discharged alive, and had 12-months continuous coverage. The primary outcomes are healthcare utilization (i.e., hospital readmissions, emergency department (ED) visits, and primary care and specialty outpatient visits) and out-of-pocket (OOP) costs. Results: The analysis included 23,940 infants, of which 84% resided in urban areas, 48% were born term (&gt;37 weeks) and 43% had a medically complex diagnosis. Medically complex infants exhibited higher rates of readmissions, ED visits, specialist utilization, and specialty services. Average OOP costs for medically complex infants was $1893, compared to $873 for noncomplex infants. Almost half (48%) of the cohort had costs that exceeded $500 in the first year of life. Implications for practice and research: This study provides insights into the financial implications of post-NICU care for infants. Findings underscore the importance of considering medical complexity over gestational age when understanding healthcare use and spending patterns. Policymakers, healthcare providers, and families can use these insights to address the financial challenges associated with caring for infants with complex medical conditions beyond the NICU.",

    "abstract": "Background: Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important diagnostic tool for infants with possible brain abnormalities. While sedation may be necessary for high quality images, it carries risks of complications. The sedation rate for MRI procedure varies widely, ranging from 0% to 100%, influenced by infant characteristics and institutional practices, with an increasing focus on non-sedated or minimally sedated approaches to reduce risks. Purpose: We studied sedation utilization in infants undergoing MRI scanning before and after implementing an MRI bundle. Methods: This cohort study utilized a pre- post-intervention design. An MRI bundle, including a process map, a safety checklist and a questionnaire collecting detailed information on sedation, were developed for our off-unit MRI suite. Pre-intervention group included infants scanned March 2018 to February 2019, and Post-intervention group March 2019 to February 2022. We hypothesized that sedation rates would significantly decrease following the intervention. Results: In the study, 229 infants in the Pre-Intervention group and 764 infants in the Post-Intervention group underwent MRI scanning. Sedation use decreased by 62%, from 29% pre-intervention to 18% post-intervention ( P = 0.0003). Post-intervention infants were 47.6% less likely to be sedated, adjusting for gestation-corrected age (OR 0.524 [0.369, 0.745]; P &lt; 0.01). Each 1-week increase in gestation-corrected age was associated with a 7.1% increase in the odds of sedation, controlling for the intervention time-period (OR 1.071 [1.022, 1.122]; P = 0.004). The questionnaire was completed 72% of the time in the post-intervention group. Implication for Practice and Research: A standardized approach and protocol development can significantly reduce sedation for neonatal MRI.

Purpose: The purposes of the study were to describe parental satisfaction with neonatal care, assess differences between satisfaction scores and identify areas for care improvement. Methods: A secondary analysis of data collected from an online survey of the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) parent experiences during the early months of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States was used. Parent satisfaction with NICU care was measured using the EMpowerment of PArents in THe Intensive Care (EMPATHIC) scale. Descriptive statistics described individual items, domain scores, and total score. Independent t-tests with Bonferroni correction compared this study to previously published results. Results: 159 mothers and 5 fathers responded to the EMPATHIC scale. The overall mean and all domain scores were significantly different from a pre-pandemic sample where scores were consistently higher. Parents indicated their desire for more cultural competence, emotional support, acknowledgement, and space to discuss their experience, guidance for discharge, better medication information and quicker response to an infant’s condition. Implications for Practice and Research: Our study identified statistically significant differences between our sample and a pre-pandemic sample and found the absolute mean difference in 3 domain scores to be &gt; 1, suggesting clinical significance.

However, it is unclear whether there is a difference in the assessment or pain management between different healthcare provider groups. Purpose: In this study, we determined whether there is a difference in perceived neonatal procedural pain between physicians and nurses working at the same facility who care for the same patients. Furthermore, we assessed perceived compliance of healthcare providers with the Japanese guidelines for neonatal pain management. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional survey using a questionnaire sent to hospitals in Japan with neonatal intensive care units. The questionnaire included responses from both physicians and nurses. Results: For most procedures, nurses’ perceptions of the degree of pain in newborns were higher than that of physicians. Thus, nurses were more likely to believe that newborns perceived more pain. For 5 of the 19 guideline recommendations, more than 80% of the hospitals reported that both physicians and nurses implement pain management, although there were some items on which physicians and nurses had divergent opinions. Implications for Practice and Research: Our findings suggest that current pain management differs among healthcare professionals, including pain assessment and the actual pain management provided in the hospital wards. Establishing cooperation and having sufficient communication among the different healthcare professionals are required to improve care for newborn patients.",

In addition, rocking beds are used to calm crying infants and ease their transition to sleep in some neonatal intensive care units. Purpose: The study was performed to determine the effect that a rocking bed has on comfort, physiological parameters, and cerebral oxygenation level in preterm infants. Methods: Data were collected from 36 preterm infants with a postnatal age of 32-36 +6 weeks between March 2021 and September 2022. For each infant, successive rocking bed treatment and control treatment (open bed) were performed in a crossover design. Results: No differences were detected in the physiological parameters and cerebral oxygenation levels of the infants in the measurements made during the rocking bed treatment ( P &gt; .05). There was no difference between the treatments in COMFORTneo scores before the start of rocking and at 15 minutes of the intervention ( P &gt; .05). However, 15 minutes and 30 minutes after the intervention, the preterm infants in the rocking bed treatment group had significantly lower COMFORTneo scores compared with the control treatment group (F = 9.701, P = .004; F = 7.680, P = .009).

    "abstract": "Caregivers of infants staying in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) experience a variety of stressors, and peer support programs have been used to formally connect newer NICU caregivers with experienced NICU caregivers to provide education and emotional support. This systematic review will synthesize the efficacy of peer support programs for caregivers after infants' NICU stays. Relevant articles were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. Studies employing a randomized, quasi-experimental, observational, or qualitative study design and studying caregiver outcomes after participation in a peer mentorship program were considered. Articles included at least 3 patients who stayed in a NICU. Out of 3594 articles originally identified, 7 articles met all inclusion criteria. Articles' level of evidence and MINORS criteria were assessed and were reviewed by at least 2 authors; the senior author adjudicated any discrepancies. All considered NICU peer support programs found improvements in caregiver stress/anxiety and depression/anger. Four studies described improvements in caregiver-perceived competency and interactions with infants. Two studies additionally reported increased caregiver hopefulness and confidence. Three studies explicitly stated that participants were satisfied with the peer support program. One randomized controlled trial did not find any benefit to peer support participants relative to controls. No studies reported worsening of caregiver outcomes. This systematic review suggests that peer support has the potential to improve caregiver well-being and self-efficacy after NICU admission, though more rigorous study is needed.",

    "abstract": "Background: Hearing loss in neonates is more than 100 times that of the general pediatric population. Research suggests that there is a large amount of toxic noise exposure for these neonates in the neonatal intensive care unit and in the transport environments. Thus, acoustic neuroprotection, or auditory protection and support of neurodevelopment, is an important concept, particularly for neonates. Purpose: A systematic review of the literature was conducted to determine the possibility of successfully supporting acoustic neuroprotection and decreasing the ambient noise level to the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Methods/Search Strategy: Across 3 databases (PubMed, Cochrane, and Science Direct), 21 articles were identified.Following PRISMA guidelines, the search was expanded to articles less than 20 years old due to lack of current studies. Inclusion criteria for articles were: infants less than 1 year old; written in English or translated to English; published within last 20 years unless seminal research; a unit quality improvement project; a literature review; a peer-reviewed article. Exclusion criteria were duplicated articles and qualitative studies. Decibel levels were extracted from articles in various neonate environments and then compared to standard recommendations. Results: Overall, the reviewed studies provided evidence that current interventions are unsuccessful in decreasing the amount of toxic noise exposure. Implications for Research and Practice: There are no “gold standard” interventions for protection of neonatal auditory systems, leading to inconsistent usage of current interventions and an overall lack of intervention focused research. More research is needed, particularly randomized controlled trials.",

    "abstract": "Background: Lack of interprofessional communication in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) can result in delayed treatments, misdiagnoses, medication errors, patient injuries, and/or death. One approach to facilitate effective communication between team members and caregivers is the use of bedside interprofessional rounding (BIPR). Purpose: The purpose of this project was to standardize and increase BIPR participation with an implementation science approach. Secondary goals included measuring the impact of BIPR on central line dwell time and patient length of stay (LOS). Methods: The implementation of a BIPR checklist in the electronic health record (EHR), supported by other implementation strategies (eg, Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendations reporting tool, staff education, audit &amp; feedback, and leadership engagement), was utilized to standardize rounding. Pre- and post-implementation data were analyzed for BIPR usage and quality metrics related to central line dwell time and patient LOS. Results: On average, the BIPR checklist was utilized 87% during the first 6 months of deployment, with fluctuation in the weekly/monthly usage due to rounding team schedules. The BIPR checklist led to a 10.5% increase in nurse participation during rounds, 15 hours less average central line dwell time, and standardization of the rounding process as reported by team members, and no difference in LOS. Implications for Practice/Research: NICUs can individualize BIPR using implementation science strategies to enhance rounding standardization and improve specific neonatal outcomes. Based on these findings, tools to standardize and promote BIPR, along with staff education, audit &amp; feedback, and leadership support, may benefit NICUs.",

Although positive effects of swaddling intervention on neonatal stress are reported, Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) nurses’ perceptions of swaddling during care procedures have not been examined. Purpose: To explore the clinical experiences and perceptions of nurses using a swaddled diaper change intervention for feasibility of implementation as a NICU policy. Methods: Ten open-ended interviews were conducted with experienced NICU nurses. An inductive content analysis was conducted for data analysis. Results: Four themes and 13 subthemes were identified. NICU nurses found that swaddling was an efficient and effective way to control stress. Nurses noticed less stress in the infant, felt less personal stress, and recognized parents were calmer when the infants were calm. Demonstrating, explaining, and providing written information for both families and NICU staff allows for education to be repetitive and multimodal. Implications for practice and research: NICU nurses found a diaper change with an upper body swaddle (infant swaddled across the upper trunk and body with legs and lower trunk open for access) intervention to be feasible, effective for stress reduction, and efficient. Expanding this simple intervention through education to staff and families can impact stress reduction for infants and parents multiple times per day.",

    "abstract": "Background: Recent research has focused on virtual visitation apps to support parents. Purpose: This study is a randomized, controlled trial designed to determine the effect of virtual visitation applied to mothers with preterm infants hospitalized in the NICU on maternal attachment and satisfaction. Methods: The research was conducted with sixty-five mothers in the NICU of a hospital in Türkiye. In addition to face-to-face visitation, virtual visitation was applied to the experimental group twice a day until discharge. Only face-to-face visitation was performed in the control group. The Maternal Attachment Inventory (MAI) and EMpowerment of PArents in THe IntensiveCare (EMPATHIC-30) were applied to both groups before and after the intervention. Results: No significant difference was found in the MAI and EMPATHIC-30 total mean scores between the experimental and control groups ( P &gt; .05). However, the MAI values measured in both groups at discharge and one month after discharge were significantly higher than the mean MAI values at the 24 th hour postpartum ( P &lt; .05). Furthermore, the EMPATHIC-30 total mean score in the experimental group was significantly higher at discharge than at the 24 th hour postpartum. Implications for Practice: Virtual visitation did not significantly affect maternal attachment but improved parental satisfaction at discharge, suggesting its role as a supplement to face-to-face interaction. As technology advances, it may become a standard part of NICU care. Implications for Research: Future studies are needed to confirm the efficacy and utility of virtual visitation interventions in clinical settings.",

Purpose: This study aimed to investigate stress levels and contributing factors among parents of neonates undergoing surgery for congenital anomalies in the NSICU. Methods: This cross-sectional and predictive study was conducted in a tertiary NSICU between 1 May 2023 and 1 May 2024, and included 50 parents. Data were collected from the “Parent and Neonate Information Form” and “Parent Stress Scale: Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.” Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS version 29. Results: The mean score of parents on the Parental Stressor Scale: Neonatal Intensive Care Unit was 123.86 ± 29.85, with the highest mean subscale score being 61.24 ± 18.25 for the “neonate behavior and appearance” subscale. The neonate’s diagnosis was related to the mean score of the “sights and sounds” subscale, with parents of neonates who had thoracic surgery having higher mean scores in this subscale. Stress related to the sights and the total number of children and the neonate’s diagnosis, explaining 23% of the variance, significantly influenced the sounds subscale. A lower number of children and a diagnosis requiring thoracic surgery were associated with higher levels of stress. Implications for Practice and Research: Targeted stress management programs that consider surgery type and the total number of children are crucial. Future research should focus on tailored interventions to reduce stress and improve parental well-being and neonates’ recovery.",

    "abstract": "In 2017, a bold new idea was proposed to the Editorial Board of Advances in Neonatal Care to develop an Editorial role dedicated to outreach on social media. The landscape of social media had become a powerful tool that harnessed the attention of the public. Up and coming scientists were learning how to use the various platforms to engage the scientific community and open access to their work. The top social media platforms that year were Facebook, YouTube, and a newer platform called Twitter (now known as X) which became a critical source of news and information during the 2016 U.S. election.1 For good or ill, X (Twitter) offered new opportunities to directly engage with the public about new research, innovations, and emerging practices in the NICU. Scientists were using the platform to self-promote research that would otherwise have to wait until publication before it saw the light of day. Social media gave scholars something to do at conferences: Amplify the freshest study results, establish critical connections with potential collaborators, engage in vigorous, albeit public debate, and share ideas that would influence patient and family-centered care, and the delivery of that care within hospitals and health systems. The content in the journal was amplified and was able to influence NICU practices across the globe. Improved engagement with our followers also highlighted a generational divide in our readership. our newest project, Facebook took over. X (Twitter) was just the latest in the ever-changing media landscape now saturated with content from sites like TikTok, Instagram and SnapChat. YouTube and LinkedIn emerged with new ways to engage readers who now listened to their favorite podcasts to get their information. One has to wonder, who has time for it all? Yet, for some, there is comfort in the printed words published in Advances in Neonatal Care (ANC). A glossy page with a color photo of an infant resonates with the care we are so familiar with providing. Laying on the counter at the nurses' station, or breakroom, or rolled up in your mailbox, something is still powerful about picking up a printed hard copy of the journal, even if it's on a shelf in the bathroom, still waiting to be read the traditional way. For some readers, there may be great comfort in consuming news of the fast-paced changes in care through a familiar format, akin to turning the pages of a well-read library book. The future is uncertain, and technology is shifting every aspect of our lives. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) introduces a new level of social media and technology with the ability to suggest what you might be interested in reading before you know it yourself. Whether we embrace or reject these new technologies will influence how future scholars convey the leading edge of practice and care. Technology and social media are the present. At Advances in Neonatal Care, we have integrated social media through a variety of platforms including X (Twitter), Facebook, and LinkedIn. You can find us on these platforms by searching for \"Advances in Neonatal Care\". Social media is used as a dynamic approach to communicate our mission and current care practices to improve outcomes for our tiniest patients and their families. The connections to fellow neonatal colleagues, access to update evidence-based practice and research, and guidelines for advocacy focused on vulnerable neonatal patients are broadened through the use of social media platforms.2 Readers, health care providers, researchers, are encouraged to engage with us on all of our platforms. Through engagement with our readers on social media we hope to develop opportunities for collaboration, innovation, and professional networking to motivate shifts in practice and public policy. Our social media platforms serve as a communication channel for raising awareness and advocacy for our neonates.2 Together our collective voice can influence policy to address the complex needs of our patients and improve outcomes for neonates and their families. ANC is changing to accommodate the variety of ways you enjoy reading our content. The journal has always been a vehicle to support all of your roles as professional healthcare providers, authors, and scientists. ANC continues to support your professional development, ignite your curiosity, and inspire you to continue to provide the best care to improve the outcomes for every neonate you care for now, and into the future.",

However, variability exists in forms of interventions, leading to inconsistent effects. Purpose: The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of multimodal sensory interventions on behavioral states and feeding outcomes in preterm infants. Data Sources: Five databases were reviewed from inception of databases to April 2025. Study Selection: Randomized controlled trials of multimodal sensory interventions examining feeding outcomes and behavioral states were enrolled. Multimodal interventions were defined as combinations of different unimodal sensory stimuli. Data Extraction: Two independent reviewers evaluated the risk of bias and extracted relevant data. Results: Thirty studies involving 4 multimodal intervention groups were identified: tactile-kinesthetic stimulation (TKS), TKS combined with oral stimulation, auditory–tactile–visual–vestibular intervention (ATVV), and a combined oral and another unimodal stimulation. TKS increased weight gain and decreased length of stay compared to standard care, but showed no advantage over uni-tactile stimulation. Combined oral with another unimodal stimulation accelerated transition time and increased feeding volume. ATVV and a combined tactile-kinesthetic and oral stimulation showed no significant effects on oral feeding outcomes. Effects on behavioral states were unclear. Frequency, duration, and caregiver quality also impacted effects. Implications for Practice and Research: TKS and a combined oral and another unimodal stimulation may enhance feeding outcomes, including weight gain, feeding volume, length of stay, and transition time. The potential effects on behavioral states remain unclear. More high-quality studies are necessary to further validate the effects of variable forms of interventions on behavioral states and feeding outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Background: Enterovirus (EV) infections are common in pregnant patients and neonates. However, peripartum EV infections are significantly underdiagnosed. Infants with EV infection may be asymptomatic, present with a non-specific febrile illness, or develop life-threatening disease. Clinical Findings: This infant had an unremarkable clinical course for a preterm neonate, until a rising direct bilirubin, elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia were identified by the neonatology team. The infant was then transferred to the level IV NICU with concern for liver failure of unknown origin. Primary Diagnosis: This case describes the development of EV sepsis syndrome in a preterm neonate, including EV sepsis, hepatitis, meningitis, and myocarditis. Interventions: The neonate received intravenous immunoglobulin as supportive care. An emergency Investigational New Drug Application was submitted to the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Division of Antivirals, and the experimental antiviral pocapavir was authorized for compassionate use. Outcomes: The neonate was discharged home from the NICU on day of life 75. She improved clinically by the end of treatment, with no critical sequelae of EV sepsis syndrome observed and no identifiable adverse effects of pocapavir noted. Regarding follow-up, the specialists continue to be pleased with her progress. Practice Recommendations: Enterovirus infections are ubiquitous in neonates and can cause life-threatening disease. NICU clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for EV infection. Lastly, the collaboration and creativity of the interdisciplinary team is vital, including the potential investigation of experimental treatments that could possibly help in extreme circumstances of acute illness.",

To compare the rate of correct transpyloric tube placement in infants with and without gastric air insufflation, and to assess complications associated with postpyloric feeding. A randomized controlled trial was conducted in a tertiary neonatal unit of a public teaching hospital. The estimated sample size included 11 participants in the intervention group (IG) and 11 in the control group (CG). In the IG, transpyloric tube insertion was aided by gastric air insufflation. Correct positioning was defined as the distal end of the tube reaching the third or fourth portion of the duodenum, as confirmed by radiography. The success rate of correct tube placement was the same in both groups (45.4% vs 45.4%, P = 1.000). Two infants experienced complications (necrotizing enterocolitis and jejunal perforation), neither of which were related to the procedure.

However, limited research exists on the relationship between SSC duration, maternal mood states, and lactation outcomes in mothers of very low birth-weight (VLBW) infants. Purpose: This study aimed to examine the associations between SSC duration, maternal mood states, and lactation outcomes pumped mother’s own milk (MOM) volume and lactation duration. During the first 6 weeks postpartum in mothers of VLBW infants. Methods: This was a secondary analysis of existing data from a randomized controlled trial of 180 mothers of VLBW infants ≤32 weeks gestation and ≤1500 g. In the parent study, researchers recorded SSC episodes and duration, while the maternal mood state was evaluated using the Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist-Revised questionnaire. Statistical analyses utilized linear mixed-effect and general linear models, adjusting for various confounders. Results: There was no independent association between total SSC minutes during the first and second 3-week periods postpartum and either positive or negative mood scores. SSC duration was positively associated with pumped MOM volume ( β = .001, 95% CI [0.0005, 0.002]; P = .0004). A significant positive association was also found between time spent in SSC and lactation duration ( β = .01, 95% CI [0.0004, 0.02]; P = .04). No significant associations were found between mood states and lactation outcomes.

Despite the prevalence of diaper dermatitis among NICU infants, exacerbated by overhydration and skin barrier disruption, standardized preventive measures remain inconsistent with a lack of focus on natural solutions. Human milk, with its immunoprotective and anti-inflammatory properties, holds promise as a topical preventive agent for diaper dermatitis (DD), yet remains under-researched. Purpose: This study evaluated the prevalence of DD following the prophylactic application of human milk to the diaper area, referred to as “breast milk on babies’ bottoms” (BoBB). Methods: A pre–post quasi-experimental design was used in a Level III NICU from September 2017 to March 2018 to evaluate BoBB. Infants &gt;34 weeks gestation, with NICU stays &gt;7 days, receiving &gt;160 mL of maternal human milk by Day 7, and without prior DD or barrier product use were included. Results: A total of 56 infants were analyzed, with 32 in the control group and 24 in the BoBB group. The prevalence of DD was 25% (n = 6) in the BoBB group, compared to 53% (n = 17) in the control group. The sample had mean gestational age and birth weights of 36.2 weeks (SD 1.9) and 2602.5 g (SD 712), respectively. Infants in the BoBB group had lower birthweights, lower gestational ages, and longer NICU stays.

    "abstract": "Background: Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) maintenance may cause pain or trauma in preterm infants. Purpose: To determine the pain and comfort levels of preterm infants during PICC maintenance and examine the effect of Palmar Grasp Reflex (PGR) stimulation on pain and comfort. Methods: The population of this crossover randomized controlled trial consisted of infants being treated in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Infants born before the 37th gestational week, who receive PICC maintenance for the first time, were included in the study. PGR stimulation was applied during the experimental condition. The study was completed with 61 observations (experimental: 30, control: 31). Data were collected via video recordings using Preterm Infant Pain Profile-Revision (PIPP-R) and Preterm Infant Comfort Scale (COMFORTneo). PIPP-R and COMFORTneo were evaluated before maintenance, during removal of the transparent film cover, during application of disinfectant, and after maintenance. Results: The difference between conditions in the mean PIPP-R and COMFORTneo scores during removal of the transparent film cover during PICC maintenance, during application of disinfectant, and after maintenance was statistically significant in favor of the experimental condition. The effect of PGR stimulation on infants’ crying duration was strong and significant (R 2 = .519) Implications for Practice: Infants experienced moderate pain during PICC maintenance. PGR stimulation reduced pain, increased comfort and shortened crying time. Nurses can perform PGR stimulation, which is a therapeutic touch, during painful procedures. Implications for Research: The effectiveness of other nonpharmacological methods that reduce pain and increase comfort in PICC maintenance should be evaluated.",

    "abstract": "Background: Grief can pose significant challenges in nurses’ lives, impacting both their personal well-being and work performance. Purpose: The aim was to examine neonatal intensive care nurses’ (NICU) experiences with neonatal death. Methods: This study used a qualitative, phenomenological study design. The study group consisted of 17 nurses in the NICU. Data were collected online via Zoom using a semi-structured interview form and analyzed through a content analysis. The study was reported in line with the COREQ (Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research) checklist. Results: Two main themes and five sub-themes emerged. (1) “Grief” conveyed that nurses developed an empathetic bond with the newborn and family through their interactions during the care process, that confronting the empty incubator after the newborn’s loss evoked profound and complex emotions, and that they sometimes had to maintain a delicate balance on ice to navigate their emotional intensity. (2) “Transformation” illustrated how grief was reflected in nurses’ lives, influencing specific roles they assumed, and how they frequently experienced a deep need for contact following the loss of a baby. Implications for Practice and Research: To support the grieving process, structural interventions such as debriefings, reflective sessions, group-based psychosocial resilience workshops, and supervision should be promoted, along with flexible rest periods that allow nurses who need solitude to recuperate. Understanding the impact of newborn loss on nurses’ lives may also guide the development of appropriate support interventions.",

Given its benefits, it is crucial to understand the facilitators and barriers that influence its implementation within the socio-ecological model (SEM), which considers the intrapersonal, interpersonal, institutional, community, and policy-level factors. Purpose: This integrative review employed the SEM for synthesis and evaluation of the evidence surrounding facilitators and barriers for providing SSC with preterm infants and parents in the NICU. Methods/Search strategy: PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and EMBASE were searched for relevant studies among mothers of preterm infants (&lt;37 weeks’ gestation). All information was extracted for analysis and synthesized in alignment within the levels of the SEM. Findings/Results: This review identified 5 levels of influence that either promote or hinder SSC in NICUs: (1) Intrapersonal, including maternal stress and infant characteristics such as weight and gestational age; (2) Interpersonal, focusing on family support and peer interactions; (3) Institutional, addressing the impact of hospital facilities and space limitations; (4) Community, considering cultural beliefs and societal norms; and (5) Public Policy, highlighting guidelines and policies. Implications for Practice and Research: To improve SSC implementation in NICUs, it is essential that health care providers focus on individualized care, privacy, cultural sensitivity, and staff education. Future research needs to focus on implementation strategies facilitating SSC while decreasing barriers, as well as outcomes associated with SSC across diverse NICU settings.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE This study tested a novel bioinstrumented radiant warmer (RW), designed to provide a reduced-intervention nursing caregiving environment (RINCE) on the ambient and body surface temperature stability of extremely low birth-weight (ELBW) infants (<1,000 g) during caregiver disruptions. The RINCE was compared with a control bed consisting of a standard RW, modified with a Plexiglas hood (Rohm and Haas, Philadelphia, PA) and an external humidity source. SUBJECTS The sample consisted of 10 extremely low birth-weight infants. The mean gestational age was 25.7 weeks (±1.4 weeks). Birth weight ranged from 570 to 880 g; mean birth weight was 730 g (±95.14 g). The mean Scores for Neonatal Acute Physiology was 21.4 (±6). DESIGN This clinical study used a small n sample, crossover time-series design. Infants were randomized to treatment order (control bed v RINCE) on the first day of life. A washout period between microenvironments was observed, and then each infant was placed into the other condition. METHODS Each infant was studied for 5 hours in each treatment condition (control bed v RINCE). Abdominal skin temperatures, heel temperatures, ambient temperatures, and relative humidity (RH) were recorded by a computerized data acquisition system every 60 seconds for hours 12 to 24 of life. Caregiver interventions, microenvironment disruptions, or both were manually coded in the data set. PRINCIPAL RESULTS The mean number of minutes abdominal temperatures were less than 36.5°C was not significantly different in either microenvironment (P = 0.48). The mean number of minutes that heel temperatures were less than 35.2°C and central-peripheral differences were greater than 2°C was significantly less in the RINCE (P < 0.04 and P < 0.001, respectively). Although the number and duration of caregiving disruptions (P = 0.71), number of procedures (P = 0.30), and the duration of interventions (P = 0.56) were not significantly different in either environment, the ambient air-temperature (P < 0.001) and RH (P < 0.001) were significantly less variable in the RINCE during and after caregiving disruptions. CONCLUSIONS This study identified the extreme interdependence of the ELBW infant's temperature and the ambient environment. The RINCE significantly improved ambient temperature variability, RH variability, and the infant's peripheral and delta temperature (ΔT) stability, particularly during and after caregiver disruptions.",

    "abstract": "Toys placed in the bed or microenvironment of infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) demonstrate high rates of colonization (92%). As with other fomites, toys may be one potential source of nosocomial infection (NI). This project critically evaluated the practice of placing toys in the microenvironment of critically ill infants by using the Iowa Model of Evidence-Based Practice to Promote Quality Care. With the model as a guide for decision making, the existing evidence was explored using a systematic review of the literature, case studies, scientific principles, theory, and expert opinion. A comprehensive review of the literature did not clearly identify a causal relationship between toys in the NICU microenvironment and NI. Levels of evidence suggesting an association between toys and NI were determined to be moderately strong and consistent. A plausible relationship between the practice of placing toys in the beds of NICU patients and risk for infection was found. These findings prompted a pilot practice change, eliminating toys in the NICU, to test the potential impact of this intervention. Pre- and postintervention infection rates were compared. NI rates decreased from 4.6 to 1.99 per 1000 patient days over a 6-month evaluation period. Although this decrease was not statistically significant, it was the lowest rate recorded in 5 years. Ongoing evaluation of NI rates is in progress. Individual NICUs must determine if the evidence warrants a practice change in their setting.",

Forty-nine sets of twins were enrolled in the study and 41 sets were ultimately analyzed. There were 21 twin sets (42 infants) in the experimental group and 20 sets (40 infants) in the control group.A prospective randomized design was used.Parents of twins in a level III NICU were approached for consent to participate in the study. Twins were randomized using sealed envelopes that designated placement in either the control or experimental group. Twin sets who were randomized to the control group received routine care in separate beds. Twin sets in the experimental group received routine care in the same bed. Guidelines for positioning of cobedded twins were utilized. Treatment and data collection started when infants met the inclusion criteria for the study.Measurements of weekly weight gain and episodes of apnea/bradycardia/desaturation (A/B/D) were collected for each group.After adjusting for baseline weight in an analysis of covariance model, the cobedded group demonstrated a significantly higher mean weight compared to the control group at week 1 (1,644 vs. 1,572 grams, respectively, F = 11.6, P = 0.001) and at week 2 (1,755 vs. 1,693 grams, respectively, F = 5.7, P = 0.02).

Although diagnosis before delivery is difficult, the clinical index of suspicion rises when a woman presents with history of decreased or absent fetal movements and antenatal monitoring shows a sinusoidal rhythm strip. The diagnosis can be made quickly by demonstration of fetal red blood cells in the maternal circulation and there is consistent recommendation in the literature to immediately order a Kleihauer-Betke test. Clinical manifestations of a fetomaternal hemorrhage depend on the volume of blood lost and the rate with which it occurred.

Rapid sequence intubation is infrequently performed in neonates despite evidence that it is safe and effective. Neonates that experience endotracheal intubation often display apnea and cardiac arrhythmias, decreased or obstructed nasal airflow, increased systolic blood pressure, and decreased heart rate and transcutaneous oxygen tension. Infants can also experience increased anterior fontanel pressure, which can place them at greater risk for intraventricular hemorrhage. Rapid sequence intubation has been shown to facilitate better intubation conditions including no movement from the infant and better visualization of the airway. Infants receiving RSI were successfully intubated twice as fast as infants who were not premedicated. Infants with premedication also had fewer changes in baseline heart rate. Neonatal RSI can be easily and safely performed in the neonate. Knowledge and skill allow for the best conditions when intubating the infant. Future research must focus on the best combination of medications for RSI in the neonate.",

Working there demands technical competence as well as the emotional aptitude to ensure that infants are cared for in an environment that values their basic humanness. Reflective strategies augment professional caregivers' perception of the emotional experience of working with others. Reflection is an essential skill that enhances the nursing profession. Reflection is a process of creating meaning from interpreting experiences through purposeful thought that guides decision making for taking the next step of action. In an effort to make a major change in our NICU, we incorporated reflective process to prepare us for implementing change. We used reflective practices to enhance the implementation efforts of individualized developmentally supportive care.",

This occurs in utero and can lead to fetal demise or an infant who presents with advanced liver disease in the neonatal period. A case of neonatal hemochromatosis is reported in a 37-week infant who presented at birth with thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and abnormal liver imaging studies. The diagnoses of infection and metabolic errors were excluded before the confirmation of neonatal hemochromatosis was made. This diagnosis was confirmed by elevated ferritin levels and extrahepatic siderosis excluding the reticuloendothelial system. Anti-oxidant therapy was initiated with N-acetyl cysteine, selenium, vitamins C and E and intravenous immunoglobulin. The infant demonstrated a positive response and was discharged home with outpatient follow up. The clinical presentation of neonatal hemochromatosis is reviewed as well as diagnosis and treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to delineate current practice for the selection of nonoral feeding routes in level III neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) across Canada. SUBJECTS All level III Canadian NICUs (n = 28). DESIGN A written questionnaire was developed specifically for gathering data in the NICU about the current method of selection of feeding tubes. METHODS We surveyed, by telephone, charge nurses at all level III NICUs to elucidate the current use of orogastric (OG) versus nasogastric (NG) route of tube for fullterm and preterm infants. RESULTS The results from this study indicate that 75% percent of NICUs in Canada primarily used NG tubes. Pediatric institutions were significantly more likely to use NG (>75% of the time) (P = .003). All of the centers (100%) using NG tubes used indwelling tubes. Only 18% of centers selected OG tubes primarily. Nonpediatric institutions were significantly more likely to use OG tubes (P = .001). Ten percent of NICUs reported using both NG and OG tubes equally. There was no difference indicated on selection of tube for preterm babies versus term babies. However, there was 100% agreement in the use of OG tubes in infants with structural anomalies of the nares or if the infants were on continuous positive airway pressure. Overall, decision regarding route of tube was made primarily according to physician preference and the natural history and experience within the NICU. CONCLUSIONS The results of this survey indicate that there are no clear clinical guidelines currently in place to determine route of feeding tubes in NICUs across Canada. Physician preference or history of the institution appears to be the most important variable in determining tube selection. Given the high prevalence of acute and chronic feeding difficulties among NICU survivors, the choice of route of tube should be guided by specific evidence-based criteria.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) rates continue to rise and pose a threat to patient health and limited hospital resources. In 2007, Illinois passed a legislative mandate requiring active surveillance cultures to screen for MRSA in all patients in hospital intensive care units. However, professional guidelines do not support mandated universal surveillance cultures, and funding to cover screening costs was not included. The purpose of the study was to examine the costs (personnel, screening test, and supply) associated with the mandated universal MRSA screening and to examine the infant health-related outcomes and costs associated with implementing MRSA screening in a special care nursery. SUBJECTS: Personnel—54 observations of staff members in a community-based hospital in a large midwestern city. Infants—445 infants admitted from January 2008 through January 2009. METHODS: Time and motion (related to screening activities by registered nurses) based on observations of staff during MRSA screenings, and abstraction of health and cost data from the infant log, infant medical records, and financial reports. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs (laboratory tests, personnel, and supplies) and infant health outcomes. DESIGN: A prospective descriptive study. RESULTS: Mandatory screening leads to increased costs, problems related to false-positives, and unintended consequences (eg, decision whether to treat non-MRSA organisms identified on screening cultures, possibility of legal implications, adverse family psychosocial affects, and questionable validity of the polymerase chain reaction test). The average total costs of laboratory, supply, and personnel were $15 270.12 ($34.31 per infant or $19.58 per screen). CONCLUSIONS: A screening test for MRSA with a high positive predictive value, low cost, and quick turnaround (<24 hours) is greatly needed for neonates. Our findings indicate that mandatory universal MRSA screening is not warranted when the incidence of MRSA is low. Just as health care providers require evidence when determining best practices, legislators should require adequate evidence before passing policy.",

    "abstract": "Preterm infants in neonatal intensive care units frequently require oxygen therapy. Clinicians are responsible for titrating oxygen to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks of this therapy. Studies have identified various toxic effects of oxygen on the developing tissues of the preterm infant; however, optimal target SpO2 ranges have not been identified. Current trends in neonatology are focusing on defining optimal oxygen saturation ranges to improve infant outcomes and to decrease complications associated with the oxygen use. Consequently, research-based guidelines are being developed in neonatal intensive care units to guide oxygen administration. As target oxygen saturation ranges are developed, issues regarding health care professional compliance with these ranges have been identified. The specific reasons for this noncompliance have not been widely explored. However, factors such as nursing shortages, staffing issues, and a de-emphasis on staff education surrounding oxygen use have been offered as possible reasons. Understanding factors shaping clinical decision-making about oxygen titration is critical when designing policies and educational programs to change oxygen titration practice and ultimately improve patient outcomes. In this article, the literature outlining the importance of oxygen titration for preterm infants is reviewed. Discussion then focuses on factors that influence clinical decision-making and how these factors may influence decisions surrounding the use of oxygen for preterm infants.",

The recommendations and rationale in the excerpt below from the complete online publication are based on the best evidence available through both neonatal research and consultation of experts on the subject. They suggest a conservative, evidence-based treatment approach for the management of hypotension in the VLBW infant during the first 3 days of postnatal life that is logical, safe, and physiologically sound. The insufficient fund of knowledge on transitional cardiovascular physiology in general and pathophysiology in particular makes establishment of strict guidelines on the treatment of hypotension in VLBW neonates impossible. What becomes clear when presenting the evidence is how much more we need to know.

    "abstract": "Background: Preterm infants often receive blood transfusions during hospitalization. Although transfusions are intended to enhance oxygen delivery, previous studies found decreases in tissue and mesenteric oxygen saturation during and after blood transfusions without changes in vital signs and hemoglobin oxygen saturation. Purpose: To study the effect of blood transfusions on regional mesenteric tissue oxygen saturation (rS o 2 ), hemoglobin saturation of oxygen (Sp o 2 ), and heart rate (HR) in premature infants. Method: A prospective, observational, nonrandomized study using a repeated-measures design was done to evaluate changes in physiologic variables (HR, Sp o 2 , rS o 2 ) before, during, and after a blood transfusion in premature infants. Results: A convenience sample of 30 infants with a mean gestational age of 25.5 (2.1) weeks was recruited. Repeated-measures analysis of variance found no significant differences in HR ( P = .06) and Sp o 2 ( P = .55) over time. However, significant differences occurred in rS o 2 over the 3 time periods ( P &lt; .001). The rS o 2 increased during the transfusion from 40.3% to 41.5%, but decreased to 34.9% in the posttransfusion period. Pairwise comparisons revealed statistically significant mean rS o 2 differences between pretransfusion and posttransfusion ( P &lt; .001), and during transfusion to posttransfusion ( P &lt; .001) periods. Implications for Research: This study supports previous findings of perfusion changes during blood transfusions in preterm infants. Implications for Practice: Measuring mesenteric tissue oxygenation during blood transfusion in very low-birth-weight infants can potentially add another physiologic parameter to guide further clinical assessment and interventions during transfusions.",

Many etiologies have been associated with the development of BPD, including aberrant temperature/humidity levels of artificial ventilation.The purpose of this literature review is to explore what is known regarding inspired air temperature/humidity levels from artificial ventilation in very premature infants, focusing on what levels these infants actually receive, and what factors impact these levels.PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched. Of the 830 articles retrieved, 23 were synthesized for study purpose, sample/study design, and temperature/humidity findings.Heating and humidification practices studied in neonatal ventilation did not maintain recommended levels. In addition, human neonatal studies and noninvasive neonatal ventilation research were limited. Furthermore, ventilation settings, environmental temperatures, and mouth position (in noninvasive ventilation) were found to impact temperature/humidity levels.Environmental temperatures and ventilatory settings merit consideration during artificial ventilation. In addition, aberrant temperature/humidity levels may impact infant body temperature stability; thus, employing measures to ensure adequate thermoregulation while receiving artificial ventilation must be a priority.This review underscores the need for further research into current warming and humidification techniques for invasive and noninvasive neonatal ventilation. A focus on human studies and the impact of aberrant levels on infant body temperature are needed. Future research may provide management options for achieving and maintaining target temperature/humidity parameters, thus preventing the aberrant levels associated with BPD.",

After the education in-service on positioning, a convenience sample of 27 infants was enrolled. Infant Position Assessment Tool was used as a visual guide for positioning and scoring by the researcher for intervention fidelity. Hammersmith scoring was completed by the occupational therapist prior to discharge.The postintervention group was younger and sicker than the control group (P < .05). The postintervention sample (M = 7.05 where 7 = 29 to <30 weeks of gestation) was younger than the preintervention sample (M = 7.22). The postintervention sample was smaller (M = 1302.15 g) than the preintervention sample (M = 1385.94 g). Results showed that the postintervention group had clinically significant weight gain and mean Hammersmith score (3.28) was higher showing positioning positively affected tone and flexion scores.With greater structure and consistent attention to developmental positioning, outcomes are positively affected.Further research with larger sample sizes will identify stronger associations and relationships between positioning and outcome measures.",

Many studies describe diaper dermatitis, but lack a full description of clinical characteristic (CC) involvement. Purpose: The purpose of this literature review is to explore the descriptions of CC of infants with DD provided within infant DD literature. Search Strategy: PubMed and Web of Science were searched using the keywords: diaper dermatitis, diaper rash, infant, and neonate. The inclusion criteria for this project are as follows: published after 1990, English language, include skin assessment or evaluation, and infant/children &lt; two years of age. Review and opinion articles were excluded. Results: A total of 454 studies were retrieved, 27 remained after review for duplicates and relevance. The CC described most often were: type of feeds, stool frequency, history of DD, use of antibiotics, and delivery mode. Synthesis of Evidence: The studies reported inconsistent CC and a lack of correlation between these characteristics and the condition of diapered skin. Many studies focused solely on the efficacy of interventions lacking description of possible relationships between DD and CC. Implications for Practice: Skin condition outcome variables can be improved with the acknowledgment of the impact CC have on the development of DD. The combination of assessment measures and CC may ultimately demonstrate more merit or rigor for describing DD severity and skin condition. Implications for Research: Future research should expand this exploration to include environmental or contributing factors to continue to identify additional risk factors for DD.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Risk of adverse outcome in late-preterm infants (born between 34 and 36 weeks and 6 days' gestation) is heightened for those living in geographic isolation (GI). We examined the relationships between GI and several mother and infant outcomes. SUBJECTS AND DESIGN: This was a tricenter cross-sectional study of 38 English-speaking late-preterm infant/mother dyads admitted to neonatal intensive care in a predominately rural Midwestern state. Eligibility for the study included English-speaking mothers and their biologically born late-preterm infants with no known anomalies. METHODS AND MAIN OUTCOME: Outcomes included maternal knowledge of infant development (Knowledge of Infant Development Inventory) and competence (Competence in Preterm Infant Care questionnaire), maternal perception of vulnerability (Vulnerable Baby Scale ([VBS]), risk, and temperament (Pictorial Assessment of Temperament ([PAT]). Infant readmission and follow-up data were also examined. Potential covariates included any use of the Internet for healthcare information, demographic data, and mother and infant health history and were obtained from medical records and from the mother. Level of GI was determined by time and distance traveled (minutes) from the mother's primary residence to the closest regional healthcare center. RESULTS: Study participants traveled 61 ± 58 miles and 72 ± 62 minutes on average. The Mean ± SD scores on assessment were as follows: Knowledge of Infant Development Inventory 77 ± 10, and Competence in Preterm Infant Care questionnaire 90 ± 14, VBS 27.5 ± 3.5, and PAT 17.5 ± 3. Bivariate associations were observed between distance and time and VBS scores (P = .03 for both). Multiple regression analysis showed significant relationship between time (P = .02) and PAT scores when maternal education (0.09) and the number of hours spent in the NICU (P = .01) were entered into the model. The association between time traveled and VBS scores became marginally significant when maternal age and Internet use were entered into the regression models. The odds for a mother to perceive her infant at risk for suboptimal outcomes were 6 times greater for each 1-hour additional travel time (odds ratio = 6.0; 95% confidence interval: 1.3-36; P = .001). There was no association between GI and readmission rate and follow-up care. Readmission rate was 8%, and anticipatory guidance was found to be inadequate. CONCLUSION: Remote access to appropriate healthcare services elicits more than legitimate concerns for the late preterm infant and warrants further investigation with consideration for how services might be more easily accessed for this at-risk group.",

Both samples were similar in race and education level but differed according to marital status.Study 1 was retrospective and descriptive, whereas study 2 was prospective and descriptive.In study 1, confirmatory factor analysis was used to evaluate the originally proposed 7-factor structure and a 1-factor model. Because of overly high correlations between 3 of the factors, a revised 5-factor model was also tested. In study 2, confirmatory factor analysis was again used to test the construct validity or goodness of fit of the 7-factor and 5-factor models.Goodness-of-fit indices and factor pattern coefficients.In study 1, high correlations between 3 of the factors in the 7-factor model did not converge. Thus, a 5-factor model was also tested. This model had reasonable fit: χ= 1339.70 (550); P < 0.01; comparative fit index = 0.85; root mean square error of approximation = 0.06; and 90% confidence interval for root mean square error of approximation = 0.058 to 0.067. In study 2, confirmatory factor analysis was again used to test the construct validity or goodness of fit of the 7-factor and 5-factor models. Results for the 7-factor model indicated unacceptable fit: χ (539) = 959.10; P < 0.01; comparative fit index = 0.76; and root mean square error of approximation = 0.09. The 5-factor model was also poor: χ (550) = 992.95; P < 0.01; comparative fit index = 0.75; and root mean square error of approximation = 0.09.Although the construct validity of the 7-factor model of the PDSS was not supported for this sample of mothers, additional factor analytic work was used to develop and provide initial validation of a 5-factor model.

Evidence supports a narrow therapeutic window between the helpful and harmful effects of supplemental oxygen in this vulnerable population. The clinical question was—what are the recommended oxygen saturation targets for the preterm infant and the preterm infant corrected to term? Multiple databases were searched for published research in English from 2008 to 2014 using key search terms. A total of 18 articles met inclusion criteria. Early neonatal research linked high levels of supplemental oxygen with retinopathy of prematurity and blindness. Years later, correlations between high arterial oxygen levels and oxidative stress leading to pulmonary and/or neurologic insults were established. Three large multicentered, international studies have recently been published (BOOST II, COT, and SUPPORT), which support oxygen saturation target ranges of 87% to 94% until vascular maturation of the retina is achieved. Two of the 3 studies reported a significant correlation between low saturation limits (85%-89%) and death in the extremely preterm population. Identified best care strategies to prevent states of hypoxia and/or hyperoxia include establishing clear target saturation limits according to recommendations, which are supported by the multidisciplinary team, adequate nurse to patient ratio, improve knowledge deficits, improve bedside compliance, and finally visual cues to remind caregivers of target saturation ranges.",

Mothers of premature/low birth-weight infants report increased posttraumatic stress (50%) and depressive symptoms (63%) compared with mothers of full-term infants. Low-income, minority mothers with greater posttraumatic stress and depression have an increased risk for premature/low birth-weight delivery compared with their white counterparts. Variations in the neuropeptide oxytocin are implicated in lactation, perinatal depression, and maternal behavior.To examine the associations among posttraumatic stress, depressive symptoms, and oxytocin in a pilot sample of minority mothers with premature/low birth-weight infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).This study employed a descriptive, correlational pilot design of 8 minority, low-income mothers with premature/low birth-weight infants. Participants answered questionnaires pertaining to posttraumatic stress, depression, lactation, and demographics and oxytocin was measured. This is a substudy that added oxytocin values.Four participants had elevated depressive symptoms and 5 supplied their own milk. Women who provided their own milk had lower depressive (t = 3.03, P = .023) and posttraumatic stress (t = 3.39, P = .015) symptoms compared with women not supplying their own milk. Women with elevated posttraumatic stress had higher levels of depressive symptoms (r(8) = 0.8, P = .006) and lower levels of oxytocin (r(8) = 0.77, P = .026).These results are congruent with previous literature on providing human milk and maternal mental health. In addition, we found a possible relationship between postpartum posttraumatic stress and oxytocin in minority women with premature/low birth-weight infants. NICU nurses should encourage lactation and assess mothers for posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms.Research is needed to identify the biologic milieu associated with posttraumatic stress and depression in at-risk mothers.",

Disinfection of skin is part of bundled cares aimed at prevention of CLABSI. While considered an essential component of insertion and maintenance bundles, the optimal solution to disinfect neonatal skin remains controversial.The purpose of this project was to survey neonatal nurse practitioners and nursing leaders across NICUs regarding the current use of chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) in term and preterm infants.This descriptive study involved the collection of survey data to determine NICU practices related to the use of CHG in their infant population. The sample was composed of nursing directors of NICUs and neonatal nurse practitioners who completed an electronic survey via a provided link.Chlorhexidine was reported to be used in 53 (82.81%) of the NICUs and was the primary agent used to prepare the skin for central vascular catheter insertion (53.23%) followed by povidone-iodine (45.16%), and 70% isopropyl alcohol (1.61%). Gestational age or birth weight restrictions for CHG use were reported in 43 (82.69%) NICUs. Trends in the data demonstrated nursing's role in using CHG in the NICU. Adverse events reported from CHG included burns, redness, dermatitis, and other irritations. Concerns included risk of absorption, burns, skin irritation, lack of evidence, and overall safety.Systematic monitoring by nurse leaders is needed to identify evidence related to skin disinfection and CHG in neonates. Targeted education for nursing staff related to directed to developmental maturation of the skin, safe use of CHG, review of best evidence, rationale for usage of CHG, and potential iatrogenic effects is recommended.Research is needed to evaluate the impact of educational offerings and surveillance for adverse events on CLABSI rates.",

Participants were 5 infants recruited from a convenience sample who were at least 37 weeks postmenstrual age, demonstrated feeding difficulties during a bedside feeding and swallowing examination, and were breastfeeding. Each participant received a FEES assessment while breastfeeding (FEES-B). Adverse events and vital signs including prefeeding and postfeeding respiratory rate, heart rate, and oxygen saturation level were recorded to assess safety. Visualization of milk, laryngeal penetration, and tracheal aspiration assessed feasibility.Participants had a mean postmenstrual age of 39.8 weeks.

Two infants successfully breastfed during FEES-B. Human milk was observable, and laryngeal penetration was noted with 1 infant.FEES-B was found to be safe, with limited data supporting feasibility. Infants demonstrated no physiologic instability during FEES-B, and milk was visualized in the pharynx during breastfeeding with 2 infants.Further studies are warranted to assess effectiveness of FEES-B in infants.",

    "abstract": "Background: Advances in prenatal testing and diagnosis have resulted in more parents learning during pregnancy that their child may die before or shortly after birth. These advances in testing and diagnosis have also resulted in more parents choosing, despite the diagnosis, to continue their pregnancies and pursue a palliative approach to their infant's short life. Perinatal hospice and palliative care is a growing model of care developed in response to these parents' previously unmet needs. A seldom-discussed opportunity to provide this care exists in outlying community hospitals, which are ideally placed to provide care close to home for families who have chosen comfort measures and time with their child. Purpose: This article reviews the definition and utility of perinatal palliative care, the population it serves, attempts to support a rational for development of community-based programs, and describes one community hospital's experience with perinatal palliative care in their community.* Methods/Search Strategy: This article describes the development and processes of a perinatal palliative care program at a community hospital in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Implications for Practice: Perinatal palliative care can be developed with the assistance of already existing training materials, resources, and staff. While the cohort of patients may be small, implementing perinatal palliative care in a community setting may result in wider availability of this care and more accessible options for these families. Implications for Research: Research possibilities include developing a template for creating a perinatal palliative care program at community hospitals that could be replicated elsewhere; assessing parental satisfaction and quality indicators of perinatal palliative care at community hospitals and at referral hospitals; and assessing outcomes in various settings.",

A comprehensive understanding of factors that influence nurses' implementation of nonpharmacological interventions for infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome is needed.To investigate barriers and enablers to nurses' implementation of nonpharmacological interventions for infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome through the lens of the Theoretical Domains Framework, which provides a structure to examine factors that influence healthcare providers' behavior related to the implementation of evidence-based practice and interventions in clinical practice.A convergent parallel mixed-methods study was conducted. Qualitative data were collected using semistructured interviews and quantitative data were collected using a tailored Determinants of Implementation Behavior Questionnaire with neonatal nurses. Findings from the interviews and surveys were merged through joint review to compare and contrast themes.Enablers and barriers to nurses' implementation of nonpharmacological interventions included education, experience, ability to implement nonpharmacological interventions, parental participation, stigmatization, lack of managerial/organizational support, staffing ratios, internal and external resources, and stress. Knowledge, Skills, Beliefs About Capabilities, Social/Professional Role and Identity, Organization, and Emotion of the Theoretical Domains Framework aligned with these themes.Findings from this study will inform the development of programs to improve nurses' implementation of nonpharmacological interventions and health and utilization outcomes in infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome. Furthermore, future work should focus on the development of programs to improve nurses' implementation of nonpharmacological interventions, with specific strategies aimed to mitigate marginalization of vulnerable patient populations.",

Critical awareness is growing in our current cultural environment about strategies to improve health equity, the need to challenge implicit bias, and dismantle racism in healthcare to decrease racial health inequities.In this article, we provide a summary of health inequities that exist within the perinatal/neonatal population and offer strategies for initiating conversations and improving health equity by challenging bias and increasing diversity.Transformative leaders must understand the evidence related to health disparities, understand social drivers of inequity issues, and identify solutions to influence change.With heightened awareness and examination of implicit bias, we can improve care for all infants and their families.We need to continue research and quality improvement efforts to improve health equity. Furthermore, research is needed that focus on social determinants of health as drivers of preterm delivery and birth complications, rather than biological (eg, racialized) factors.Video Abstract available at:https://journals.lww.com/advancesinneonatalcare/Pages/videogallery.aspx?autoPlay=false&videoId=42.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, the provision of comfort care and support during the dying process for infants born with life-limiting diagnoses has occurred in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). A major goal for the families of these infants is often the opportunity to spend as much time as possible with their infant in order to make memories and parent their infant. The objective of the Mother Baby Comfort Care Pathway is to implement a program of family-centered care with logistically flexible care delivery, allowing mothers and their families to share as normal a postpartum care experience as possible with a focus on quality of life, memory making, and time spent together. The program was developed with the nucleus of care coordination and provision on the Mother Baby Unit (postpartum unit), with involvement from the labor and delivery room, NICU, and other units as necessary to provide the postpartum mother, her dying infant, as well as possible additional siblings (in the case of multiple gestation), postpartum care while rooming-in. The program was rolled out with training workshops for postpartum nurses. Nurses who took part in the workshops and the patient care program rated both highly. The Mother Baby Comfort Care Pathway aims to offer a framework for providing multidisciplinary family-centered comfort care to newborns during the postpartum period in a compassionate, evidence-based, and individualized manner in order to maximize quality time together for families with a dying infant.",

    "abstract": "Background: Although it is well established that standardized treatment protocols improve outcomes for infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), there remains variance between existing protocols. Purpose: The purpose of this article was to review current literature on protocols for CDH management in the preoperative period and to describe a care pathway integrating best practice elements from existing literature with volume-targeted ventilation strategies previously in place at a major tertiary care center in the Pacific Northwestern United States. Methods/Search Strategy: A systematic review of literature was performed according to PRISMA guidelines to identify current publications on CDH protocols and examine them for similarities and differences, particularly regarding ventilation strategies. Findings/Results: Although existing protocols from multiple regions worldwide shared common goals of reducing barotrauma and delaying surgery until a period of clinical stabilization was achieved, their strategies varied. None included volume-targeted ventilation with pressure limitation as a method of avoiding ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI). Implications for Practice: Institutions that routinely manage infants with CDH should have a standardized treatment protocol in place, as this is shown to improve outcomes. This may include volume-targeted ventilation with pressure limitation as a successful VILI-limiting strategy. Implications for Research: While standardized protocols have been shown to increase survival rate for infants with CDH, more research is needed to determine what these protocols should include. Specifically, there is a need for future study on the most appropriate ventilation mode for this population.",

However, a KUB may miss up to 50% of the early signs of NEC. Recent advances in abdominal ultrasound (AUS) can expedite this diagnosis and improve clinical management. Purposes: To illustrate AUS findings that suggest NEC through 3 case examples. To review current literature regarding advantages and limitations of AUS compared with KUB. Results: The added visualization of intra-abdominal structures with AUS compared with KUB improves the diagnosis and management of NEC. Some AUS features are highly suggestive of impending bowel perforation, while others can confirm bowel perforation despite a negative radiograph. Implications for Practice: AUS expedites time to diagnosis of NEC and helps to stratify patients who may fail medical management and require surgical intervention. Implications for research: More quality improvement studies are needed to validate an AUS protocol for the management of NEC. Advances in technology, such as contrast-enhanced ultrasound, may improve NEC detection with AUS in the future.

Details of postdischarge feeding methods and difficulties are needed to inform the care of preterm breastfeeding dyads. Purpose: To describe postdischarge breastfeeding characteristics of mother–preterm infant dyads up to 12 weeks corrected gestational age (CGA). Methods: A prospective observational study of preterm dyads (birth 24-33 weeks' gestation) that fed their mother's own milk (MOM) at discharge from a neonatal unit in Perth, Western Australia. Feeding method and frequency, breastfeeding duration, difficulties, and nipple shield use were recorded at 2, 6, and 12 weeks CGA. Results: Data were obtained for 49 mothers (singleton infant n = 39, twins n = 10). At 12 weeks CGA, 59% fed any MOM with 47% exclusively fed MOM and 31% fully breastfed. Nipple shield use reduced from 42% at 2 weeks CGA to 11% at 12 weeks CGA. Compared with mothers who exclusively fed MOM at discharge (n = 41) those who fed both MOM and infant formula (n = 8) were more likely to wean before 12 weeks CGA ( P &lt; .001). Weaning occurred before 2 weeks CGA in 12/19 (63%), with low milk supply the most frequently cited reason. Implications for Practice: Most mothers with a full milk supply at discharge successfully transition to predominant breastfeeding. Frequent milk removal needs to be prioritized throughout the preterm infant's hospital stay. Implications for Research: Examination of facilitators and barriers to early and continued frequent milk removal across the postpartum period is required to identify strategies to optimize lactation after preterm birth.",

Variations exits with respect to test procedure type, infant age at testing, and test relatedness. Purpose: To assess developmental continuity using multiple developmental measures from birth to 12 months in a single cohort of term infants. Methods: A secondary analysis, longitudinal, correlational design was used to assess developmental continuity in a single cohort of infants (n 27). Measures included: sleep, using the Motility Monitoring System (first 48 hours of life); temperament, using the Infant Characteristics Questionnaire (ICQ, 6 months) and the Revised Infant Temperament Questionnaire (RITQ, 12 months); problem-solving, using the Willatts Infant Planning Test (PS, 9 and 12 months); and the Fagan Test of Infant Intelligence (FTII, 6 and 9 months). Results: Using Spearmen correlation, significant correlations included: (1) Sleep and ICQ: transitional sleep and \"unpredictable\" (r 0.455, P .017), \"unadaptable\" (r 0.420, P .026), and \"dull\" (r 0.416, P .028); (2) ICQ and FTII 6 months (r −0.512, P .008); (3) RITQ \"approachability\" and quiet sleep (r 0.662, P .005); (4) arousals in active sleep and PS at 9 months (r −0.528, P .016). Implications for Practice: Given our reported continuity between early sleep and later developmental measures, sleep-wake state should be considered in caregiving and environmental control to support sleep. Parental education on facilitating sleep-wake regulation in the home environment is essential. Implications for Research: These data support the existence of continuity between early sleep and later developmental milestones warranting a larger-scale investigation. Specific focus on development of care strategies for facilitating sleep immediately following birth is warranted.",

Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the effect of lactation staff type on breastfeeding outcomes during hospital stay after the addition of peer counselors to a NICU lactation program. SUBJECTS: A total of 596 mother-infant pairs admitted to Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio, pre- and postlactation program expansion. DESIGN: A descriptive pre-/posttest study as conducted. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Differences in provision of any maternal breast milk, exclusive breast milk, or direct breastfeeding during NICU stay and at discharge were evaluated pre and postprogram implementation. Logistic regression was used to determine associations between lactation staff type and each outcome during hospital stay. RESULTS: Infants receiving any breast milk during NICU stay increased from baseline to postprogram year 1 (63% vs 73%; P= 0.03). Direct breastfeeding increased from baseline to postprogram year 4 (42% vs 53%; P= 0.03). Mothers seen by only peer counselors were less likely to provide any breast milk at discharge, provide exclusive breast milk during stay or discharge, to be direct breastfeeding during stay or at discharge compared with mothers seen by both peer counselors and lactation consultants.

Purpose: This study examines the lived experiences of these women, how they coped with their roles as professionals and parents, and how their responses differed from those of NICU mothers without professional NICU experience. Methods: A narrative qualitative design was utilized to examine the lived experiences of study participants. Face-to-face taped interviews were conducted. Responses were transcribed, then analyzed using both computer-assisted data analysis and manual analysis. Results: Six nurses participated. Their responses were grouped into 6 categories on the basis of previous research. These participants experienced many of the same issues as NICU mothers without professional experience. However, there were meaningful differences. NICU nurses were vocal advocates from the first day of admission. They were also knowledgeable about how to negotiate and work around the system. Implications for Practice: NICU nurses who have had the experience of having an infant in the NICU have seen the healthcare system from both sides and can be advocates for family-centered care, helping their coworkers understand what works and what does not work for NICU families.

This can result in intermittent tachyarrhythmias such as supraventricular tachycardia. In rare occasions, sudden death may occur from atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular conduction. Supraventricular tachycardia typically has a sudden onset and offset, classified as a paroxysmal arrhythmia. Because of the variable occurrence, Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome may go undiagnosed in the immediate newborn period. Purpose: To highlight arrhythmia as a possible cause of sudden decompensation in infants. Case Findings/Results: The clinical presentation of this infant is complex and a number of potential diagnoses were considered. Preexcitation on electrocardiogram resulted in the diagnosis of Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome. Implications for Practice: Nurses caring for infants should be alert to tachycardia and irregularities of the heart rate, including those in the prenatal history, and should report them for evaluation. While all parents should be taught to watch for signs of illness, parents of infants with Wolff–Parkinson–White have additional learning needs, including recognizing early signs and symptoms of heart failure.",

The presence of the NNP supported the development and integration of the advanced practice nursing role with interdisciplinary team members in both the LDRP and the emergency department.The NNP was able to provide expertise, leadership, and mentorship for neonatal resuscitation and stabilization as well as education and consultation on neonatal care. In addition to the services provided by the NNP for infant's requiring acute care, the NNP provided transitional support for those infants who remained with their mothers in the LDRP unit. Furthermore, time required by the neonatal transport team to stabilize babies before transport to the NICU was decreased with NNP presence.The divergence from practice of the traditional NNP clinical role in the NICU setting to more of a consultant and nursing leader has proven to be a valued role at the community hospital.A solid economic analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the NNP role in this community hospital is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Background: Social determinants of health (SDOH) are the nonmedical factors that influence health outcomes. SDOH can be grouped into 5 domains: economic stability, education access and quality, healthcare access and quality, neighborhood and built environment, and social and community context. SDOH impact people's health and quality of life but may also contribute to disparities in access to food, education, and healthcare. SDOH uniquely influence parent feeding practices in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in a variety of ways, ranging from logistical considerations for parent visitation to cultural beliefs such as family perception of human milk feeding. Evidence Acquisition: A hypothetical case example of a preterm infant with a feeding disorder in the NICU is used to connect SDOH that influence prenatal health, parental lived experience, and postnatal medical care to maternal and infant outcomes with implications for feeding practices. Barriers and facilitators to successful feeding practices in the NICU and at discharge are considered for each SDOH domain. Results: This case example increases awareness of SDOH and how they influence parent feeding practices in the NICU, focusing on the intersection of SDOH, parent stress, and oral feeding outcomes. Examples were provided for how to support applying findings into practice. Implications for Practice and Research: By being creating a culture of SDOH awareness, NICU staff can assist families in overcoming barriers by putting supports in place to increase equitable participation in developmentally supportive feeding practices during the NICU stay.",

    "abstract": "Background: Infants in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) are exposed to frequent stressors that impact their neurodevelopmental outcomes. Parent presence and engagement are considered critical to improving infant outcomes, yet associations between cumulative NICU parent presence, engagement, and infant stress are infrequently examined. Purpose: To examine associations between NICU infant stress and the amount (hours per week) or frequency (days per week) of parent presence and skin-to-skin care (SSC). Methods: A secondary analysis of a data set representing 78 NICU families was conducted. Infant acuity was measured using Neonatal Medical Index (NMI) scores. Parent presence and SSC data were collected from electronic medical records. Infant stress was measured using resting salivary cortisol levels collected at NICU discharge (median = 33 days of life). Results: More cumulative SSC was associated with lower discharge cortisol in NICU infants for SSC measured in hours per week ( P = .03) or days per week ( P = .05). Cumulative parent presence was not significantly associated with infant cortisol at discharge. Hierarchical regression analyses examining timing of parent presence supported a model including admission cortisol, NMI score, and parent presence during weeks 1 to 4 of life for explaining infant stress at discharge ( R 2 = 0.44, P = .004). Analyses examining timing of SSC supported a model including admission cortisol, NMI score, and frequency of SSC during week 1 for explaining infant stress at discharge ( R 2 = 0.21, P = .04). Implications for Practice and Research: Early, frequent SSC to mitigate stress in NICU infants was supported. Results suggested that timing of parent presence impacts NICU infant stress; however, additional study is recommended.",

Implementation science (IS) can guide successful uptake of evidence-based practice (EBP) ERH interventions. It is unknown if implementors of ERH interventions currently use the resources of IS to improve implementation. Purpose: A narrative review of recent literature on implementation of ERH EBPs was completed to understand (a) which ERH interventions are currently being implemented in NICUs globally, (b) whether clinical implementors of ERH interventions have adopted the resources of IS, (c) existence of implementation gaps, and (d) implementation outcomes of ERH interventions in contemporary literature. Data Sources: Scopus, PubMed, and CINHAL were searched for original research regarding implementation of dyadic ERH interventions using key words related to IS and ERH. Study Selection: For inclusion, ERH EBPs had to have been implemented exclusively in NICU settings, contained data addressing an IS domain, printed in English within the last 5 years. Twenty-four studies met inclusion criteria. Data Extraction: Studies were distilled for intervention, IS domains addressed, location, aims, design, sample, and outcomes. Results: Eleven ERH interventions were described in the literature. Few studies utilized the resources of IS, indicating variable degrees of success in implementation. Discussions of implementation cost were notably missing Implications for Practice and Research: Implementors of ERH interventions appear to be largely unfamiliar with IS resources. More work is needed to reach clinicians with the tools and resources of IS to improve implementation outcomes.",

This procedure negatively affects the comfort level of premature neonates. Purpose: To determine the effect of 2 nonpharmacologic methods, swaddling and the administration of oropharyngeal colostrum, on the pain and comfort levels of preterm neonates during ES. Methods: This randomized controlled experimental study comprised 48 intubated premature neonates (swaddling group n = 16; oropharyngeal colostrum group n = 16; and control group n = 16) at 26 to 37 weeks of gestation. The neonates were swaddled with a white soft cotton cloth or administered 0.4 mL of oropharyngeal colostrum 2 minutes before ES, according to the group in which they were included. Two observers evaluated the pain levels (Premature Infant Pain Profile-Revize [PIPP-R]) and comfort (Newborn Comfort Behavior Scale [COMFORTneo]) of the infants by observing video recordings of before, during, and after the procedure. Findings/Results: A significantly lower mean PIPP-R score was found in the swaddling group during ES compared with the control group ( P = .002). The mean COMFORTneo scores of the swaddling and oropharyngeal colostrum groups during ES ( P &lt; .01, P = .002) and the mean PIPP-R and COMFORTneo scores immediately after ES and 5, 10, and 15 minutes later were significantly lower than the control group ( P &lt; .005). Implications for Practice and Research: Swaddling was effective both during and after the procedure, while oropharyngeal colostrum was effective only after the procedure in reducing ES-related pain in premature neonates. Swaddling and oropharyngeal colostrum were effective in increasing comfort both during and after the procedure.",

Purpose: The purpose was to examine the current state of the science related to multimodal, dyadic ERH interventions implemented in the NICU setting in the United States and identify gaps in the current literature. Data Sources: PubMed, Scopus, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and PsycInfo were searched in November 2022 and November 2023 for original studies and conference proceedings from 1970 to present in the English language. Gray literature searches were performed in February 2023 and December 2023. Study Selection: English language, original research, with a focus on multimodal, dyadic ERH interventions that took place primarily in a NICU in the United States were included. Outcome measures could be related to implementation, relational health, or physical and/or mental health outcomes of parent and/or infant. Eighteen of 2021 reviewed articles met the inclusion criteria. Data Extraction: Data were extracted for author, year, intervention, purpose, methods, sample, paternal inclusion, dyadic components, non-dyadic components, and major outcomes/results and distilled for study characteristics, multimodal, dyadic intervention characteristics, and outcome measures. Results: Several multimodal dyadic interventions exist to aid ERH in the NICU, providing evidence of improved outcomes for infants and families. More research is required using higher sample sizes and replication studies. Implications for Practice and Research: ERH interventions show promise in improving neurodevelopmental, behavioral, and maternal mental health outcomes and should be considered for implementation into NICU services.",

Correlation coefficients among variables were computed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Postconceptional age (PCA) at the time of full bottle feedings and transition time from the first to full bottle feedings. PRINCIPAL RESULTS: The number of bottle feedings received per day during the transition from first to full bottle feedings was inversely related to length of transition to full bottle feedings. There was no relationship between the number of bottle-feeding opportunities and PCA at full bottle feedings. CONCLUSIONS: The achievement of full bottle feedings may be facilitated by increased bottle-feeding opportunities. More research about the relationships among feeding readiness, outcomes, and opportunities is needed.",

    "abstract": "As a result of the 1993 National Institutes of Health Consensus Statement recommending hearing screening for all infants before discharge from the newborn nursery, there are an increasing number of newborns identified with hearing impairment requiring follow-up services. Research has shown that hearing-impaired infants who receive intervention by the time they are 6 months adjusted gestational age are likely to develop language that is equal to their normal-hearing peers. Newborn hearing screening will not attain its goal of early intervention for hearing loss unless a comprehensive follow-up program is in place. The neonatal nurse plays an important role in the follow-up program by providing information to parents and stressing the importance of follow-up. Follow-up for infants identified through the screening process includes rescreening within 4 to 6 weeks of discharge and a full diagnostic evaluation for infants who fail the rescreening. The diagnostic evaluation includes Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR), Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE), and middle ear assessment. The course of treatment or therapy and the type of amplification chosen for hearing-impaired infants depends on the type and degree of hearing loss as well as the communication mode chosen by the family. The ultimate goal of early audiological diagnosis of hearing loss is to begin treatment as soon as possible to minimize delays in speech/language and academic development. This article focuses on what needs to happen after newborn hearing screening to ensure early and optimal intervention for hearing-impaired infants.",

DESIGN As part of a larger, exploratory study, a qualitative descriptive study was conducted to analyze fathers' perceived contributions to the process of providing breast milk. METHODS Fathers were interviewed with a semi-structured interview guide. All interviews were audiotaped, and verbatim transcripts were analyzed by using qualitative descriptive methods. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Supportive behaviors as identified by fathers of hospitalized premature infants. PRINCIPAL RESULTS Fathers described 3 types of behaviors used to support the provision of breast milk to their hospitalized premature infants: assistance with the pumping process, assumption of additional daily domestic responsibilities, and provision of moral support. CONCLUSIONS Results from this study suggest several significant behaviors that fathers perceived they performed to support their partners' efforts to provide breast milk to their hospitalized premature infants.",

The gestalt for correcting circulatory compromise is generally performed in a stepwise manner; first ensuring that the vasculature is filled, then administering medications to tighten the vasculature, and lastly, compensating for an immature vasculature. This stepwise approach is reflected in the pharmacological interventions of providing fluid boluses (filling the pump), giving catecholamines (tightening the pump), and starting hydrocortisone (compensating for an immature pump). While the stepwise management approach may be familiar to some nurses, it is important to understand the evidence-based rationale that supports clinical decisions. This article will outline physiology unique to the neonate, clarify terminology that surrounds hypotension and shock, and explore various methods for the treatment of circulatory compromise in the preterm neonate.",

Interviews were transcribed and then coded and categorized using NVivo 10 Software (QSR International, Victoria, Australia).Categories that emerged from our data include (1) perceived indications, (2) learning curve, (3) perceived costs, (4) perceived shortages, and (5) barriers to use. Providers believed that bCPAP was easy to learn and that it helped empower neonatal nurses in decision-making process. Participants provided a nuanced perspective of cost-benefit associated with bCPAP and that it helped make optimal use of limited resources. Participants identified several barriers to the implementation of bCPAP.Providers of a level III NICU in a lower- to middle-income country viewed the use of bCPAP favorably. Addressing context-specific barriers will be important for the successful widespread implementation of bCPAP.Further research will need to focus on whether bCPAP can be safely implemented at level II NICUs.Video Abstract Available at https://journals.lww.com/advancesinneonatalcare/Pages/videogallery.aspx.",

Because of the large heterogeneity between the studies, it was not possible to synthesize the results in meta-analyses. The results are presented according to thematic analysis.No individual study reported research exclusively in newborns 37 to 42 weeks of gestation. Eight studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, but the population in all these studies included both premature and term newborns. Evidence about mechanical ventilation tailored exclusively to full-term newborns is scarce.Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation with a 6 mL/kg tidal volume and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 8 cm H2O may be advantageous in full-term newborns.There is an urgent need for high-quality studies, preferably randomized controlled trials, in full-term newborns requiring mechanical ventilation to optimize oxygenation, ventilation, and short-term outcomes, potentially stratified according to the underlying pathology.",

Significant evidence emerged in recent years to guide practice, yet current practice patterns and their alignment with the evidence remain unknown.To examine current HFNC practice patterns and availability of clinical practice guidelines used in neonatal intensive care units in the United States.A nonexperimental, descriptive study was designed using a web-based survey to elicit a convenience sample of US neonatal providers. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, χ tests were used to test for differences among the categories, and post hoc comparisons among each combination of categories were conducted using a Bonferroni-corrected α of .05 to determine significance as appropriate.A total of 947 responses were analyzed (626 neonatologists and 321 neonatal nurse practitioners). Univariate analyses suggested wide variations in practice patterns. One-third of the respondents used clinical guidelines, the majority utilized HFNC devices in conjunction with nasal continuous positive airway pressure, more than two-thirds used HFNC as a primary respiratory support treatment, and among all respondents, significant differences related to HFNC device types were reported.US providers revealed wide practice variations related to HFNC therapy. In addition, type of device used appears to impact practice patterns and approaches. Use of standardized guidelines was reported by one third of the respondents, and as such may be the contributing factor for wide practice variations.Future Research is needed to target aspects of practice where practice variations exist, or practice is not supported by evidence. Significant practice differences related to the device types should be considered in future research design.",

    "abstract": "The opioid epidemic remains a serious issue in the United States and presents additional challenges for women of childbearing age. An increasingly common complication of opioid use is neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), or infant withdrawal from in utero exposure to opioids.The objective of our qualitative study was to identify service needs and barriers to care in the NAS epidemic in Ohio, which has among the highest rates of opioid use and NAS in the nation.Drawing on interviews with 18 healthcare providers, we investigated the challenges, opportunities, and service gaps in treating NAS. Open-ended questions covered opioid misuse and drug treatment, provision of and barriers to healthcare, and suggestions to improve prevention and programming. Content analysis identified major themes.Providers were primarily women (67%) and included individuals working in healthcare administrative positions, hospital settings, clinics, and social support positions for pregnant women or new mothers. Our results suggest that rather than an acute diagnosis, NAS is better conceptualized as a \"cascade of care\" including (1) prevention, (2) prenatal care, including drug treatment, (3) labor and delivery, and (4) aftercare. Providers identified challenges and opportunities at each stage of the cascade that could influence NAS outcomes.Our results suggest that greater resources, coordination, and cross-disciplinary education are urgently needed across the cascade of care to effectively address NAS.Framing NAS as a cascade of care allows researchers to identify points along a cascade where mothers and infants require enhanced care and access to social and health services.",

    "abstract": "Background: Hunter syndrome, or mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II), is a lysosomal storage disease that affects the breakdown of sugar in the body. Research has made it possible to reveal the cause of the disease, thus helping diagnose and treating this rare disorder. Enzyme replacement therapy will help children live longer and healthier lives. Purpose: The purpose of this literature review is to explore the existing knowledge on MPS II and to inform the nursing community about the prevalence of MPS II and examine why it is important to offer screening to parents of a newborn or child. Search Strategy: CINAHL, PubMed, Cochrane, and Google Scholar were searched using the key words to find publications in English on MPS II during 2009 to 2018. Findings: Early detection is key for successful management of MPS II. Early initiation of enzyme replacement therapy will enhance the health of children. Support groups advocate for services for the children and their families. Implications for Practice: Earlier initiation of treatment leads to better outcomes, and healthcare providers should advocate for including MPS II in newborn screening. Families should be offered genetic counseling and support services. Implications for Research: More research is essential to identify the long-term effects on families and the effect of enzyme replacement therapy on children with MPS II. Conclusion: The birth of a child with the rare disorder such as MPS II will change the lives of families forever. Early identification and treatment can slow down decline in health and improve quality of life of children and their families.",

At discharge, infants' medical histories were reviewed and a Neurobiologic Risk Score (NBRS) was used to determine risk for poor neurodevelopmental outcomes.Premie-Neuro raw scores and classifications were analyzed to determine the tool's reliability. Construct validity was measured by determining whether the Premie-Neuro could discriminate between infants identified as high-risk or low-risk for neurodevelopmental delays by using a NBRS of 5 as the cutoff for high- and low-risk infants.The intraclass correlation coefficients for interrater and test-retest reliability varied from 0.391 to 0.556 and from 0.493 to 0.592, respectively. Analysis of variance revealed that the Premie-Neuro raw scores for infants with NBRS > 5 were significantly worse than those for infants with NBRS < 5 (P = .000-.010).The Premie-Neuro is a valid assessment tool for discriminating between preterm infants at high and low risk for neurodevelopmental delay. Interrater reliability of the Premie-Neuro was poor, and test-retest reliability of the Premie-Neuro was fair to moderate. The Premie-Neuro may be acceptable for assessing groups of infants, but there is no evidence that reliability is sufficient for clinical decision-making for individual infants. More research needs to be done to improve the reliability of the Premie-Neuro and assess other facets of the Premie-Neuro's reliability.",

This article provides insight on how hospitals can implement an effective screening tool through patient surveying and testing, nurse education, and collaboration with community agencies in a multidisciplinary advisory committee setting. This discussed method of universal perinatal screening results in increased positive screens and increased referrals for care and support. Emphasis is placed on universal screening and testing methods. Nurses are trained in motivational interview techniques that convey empathy, listening, and objectivity. Community agencies partner with hospital staff through onsite meetings with families that determine the best discharge plan for the newborn.

Infants born before 30 weeks of gestation have the poorest developmental prognosis of all infants. These infants have lengthy hospitalization periods in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU,) an environment that is not always supportive of brain development and long-term developmental needs. The model supports the premise that interventions focused on neuroprotection during the neonatal period have the potential to positively affect long-term developmental outcomes for vulnerable very preterm infants. Finding ways to better understand the complex relationships among NICU-based interventions and long-term outcomes are important to guiding caregiving practices in the NICU.",

It is protective during the development of the gastrointestinal tract, important in neurologic development, immune system function, and nourishment. Human milk has a number of components that aid in the anti-inflammatory process and free radical reduction and is a building block for neurologic development. Cerebral white matter injury is a common occurrence in preterm infants. Results of this injury can be seen into early childhood and throughout the life of the individual. White matter injury most frequently occurs because of hypoxia and the inflammatory process, which often results in the injury of myelinating oligodendrites. This article proposes the potential importance of human milk in slowing and preventing cerebral white matter injury because of the components in human milk that affect the inflammatory and free radical reduction processes. It also proposes its ability to provide nutrients essential to myelin development.",

    "abstract": "Do you consider yourself to be an innovative nurse? The concept of innovation is frequently permeating conversations around the future of nursing. Many may hear the term innovation, and wonder “what does it really mean to me as a nurse?” and others may think “innovation does not really apply to me.” Yet, you may be surprised to learn that you are innovating in your role as a nurse every day in your work with the infants in the neonatal intensive care unit. SO WHAT IS AN INNOVATION? An innovation is a new product, service, or process.1 An innovation is a discovery made when one recognizes a problem or barrier to completing a necessary task or caregiving activity. Neonatal nurses innovate daily at the bedside. Neonatal nurses with “longevity” in the profession (eg, nearing retirement) remember when very few products or processes were tailored to our unique population. When providing care at the bedside today, nurses still encounter barriers toward effective care delivery that require creative problem-solving. These barriers must be removed to deliver the required and desired care to the infant and the family. As nurses, these barriers often lead us to create workarounds. Every day, nurses are faced with a problem (or many problems) that they need to work around when delivering patient care. Workarounds are present in patient care environments because of limitations, omissions, or gaps in the organization. The organization could be the unit, hospital, or hospital system that might include many different hospitals. For decades, nurses prided themselves in being able to work around persistent problems.2–4 Nurses are left with no other choice, as that workaround is what stands between the nurse and his or her infant's care. However, we now need to view these workarounds differently for what they are: clues to larger system-level problems that must be addressed at an organizational level. WORKAROUNDS IN ACTION The problems solved through workarounds are examples of innovation done on a one-to-one basis. You might have a neonate that requires a wound care dressing that is too large for that infant. This necessitates cutting the product to size, resulting in frayed edges that compromise the wound bed. Appropriate-sized devices have been a persistent problem in neonatal care. The need for a workaround to address a problem may happen multiple times per day for neonatal nurses. A scalable innovation would be to create products that are sized to fit the needs of neonates, and many of the neonatal products available today came from the innovative ideas of nurses. Being an innovative nurse is important to providers, infants, and their families across the nation and globe! Another workaround is the nurse's paper brain or report sheet used during handoff to gather all the information needed to know one's patient in one place that can be referenced over the course of your workday. Yet, most of that information being gathered and written already exists in the patient's health record. Each day you and your peers are repeating a process that is fraught with the potential for errors, is risky to the patient's care, and could be eliminated with the right system-level tool or solution. Every nurse uses this process each day because it was the best possible solution before technology advanced into wireless networks and small portable computer devices (eg, smartphones). Yet, with such advances, we have the capability to ensure every nurse has the same information across shifts. To do so would reduce the risk of incorrect or omitted information given during handoff among many other benefits to the nurses, patients, families, and organization. Equipment can often be a difficult thing to find when needed for feedings or IV medication administration. At times, nurses cannot find the necessary equipment and the patient's feed or medication may be unnecessarily delayed. Working around this presents the potential for impact on the patient's care. Instead of bargaining with our peers or hiding equipment in drawers, there must be a better way to determine the number of feeding pumps and syringe pumps necessary each day for a unit. Secondary to the number of devices, tracking tools may be of benefit. These are just 3 prevalent examples of problems nurses frequently face each day while at work caring for patients. All 3 of these are solved today through workarounds. Yet, not one of these issues needs to remain a workaround. Not one of these should remain a case for “we've always done it this way.” MOVING AWAY FROM THE MANTRA OF “WE'VE ALWAYS DONE IT THIS WAY” One may wonder why we need to eliminate the need for workarounds. After all, nurses are exceptionally skilled at creating solutions to these problems faced each day and often multiple times per day.2 Yet, just because we have always done it this way as a profession does not mean that it is the best way for it to be done. This expression does mean that nurses or the nurse who says this is not open to change through innovation. The nursing profession cannot continue to thrive, grow, and advance with the ever-changing healthcare landscape without also innovating and finding new ways of leveraging the new tools into our practice environments and the profession at large. MOVING BEYOND THE WORKAROUND TOWARD A CULTURE OF INNOVATION The future of nursing must acknowledge the current culture as one that is well equipped to solve some of the most challenging issues facing out profession. Staffing, technology, and continual improvements in neonatal care are just 3 areas where we know we have opportunities to make improvements. As a profession, we must move beyond the workaround and recognize these as system-level problems being solved through individual-level workarounds. As we move beyond the workaround, it opens the door for us to embrace the potential for viewing these workarounds as scalable solutions in the form of new products, solutions, or processes that can be applied across the nursing profession. Neonatal phototherapy and the Bili-Bonnet are 2 solutions invented by nurses.5 Pay close attention to what you see as problems and consider how you can solve them. You might be the next nurse to invent and patent a product we are all in need of each day. You might be the next nurse to build a company around that innovation. By opening these doors, you might be the next nurse to invent and subsequently patent an innovation that will impact thousands to millions of people. You may turn your innovation into a company that allows for others to benefit from what you have created out of an idea. You first need to know it is an option to you as a nurse. Second, you need to know that you are already innovating each day through your workarounds. Third, be proud of your idea, keep it between you and those whom you trust, and then work to bring it to life.

We performed logistic regression analyses to test the associations of \"big five\" personality traits (NEO Five Factor Inventory), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), and depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) symptom levels during pregnancy and postpartum with meeting the WHO recommendation of 6 months' exclusive breastfeeding.Agreeableness (odds ratio [OR] = 1.18, P = .006) and openness (OR = 1.31, P < .001) were positively associated with meeting the WHO recommendation, whereas extraversion (OR = 0.83, P = .005) and neuroticism (OR = 1.18, P = .006) were negatively associated. After adjustment for both antenatal and postpartum symptom levels of anxiety and depression, the associations of the agreeableness, extraversion, and openness personality traits remained strong and statistically significant (P < .05).Patient-centered care should take personality into account in an effort to tailor interventions to optimize breastfeeding behavior.In contrast to earlier findings, personality traits may be of greater importance than symptoms of anxiety and depression for meeting the WHO recommendation of 6 months' exclusive breastfeeding.",

    "abstract": "Infants in the newborn intensive care unit (NICU) often receive medications or nutritional support for extended periods. Due to the fragility of veins, central lines are often used. Adverse outcomes from central lines such as infections and line dislodgements, where the line terminates in a peripheral vessel rather than centrally, can drastically increase infant morbidity and mortality. Although evidence exists addressing the specialized needs of premature or smaller infants, there is far less evidence regarding infants that are larger, more physiologically complex, and have longer stays.Using evidence-based practice strategies, we examined the literature for central line maintenance practices specific to the NICU population and created a care maintenance bundle to reduce infection and line dislodgement rates. Furthermore, we examined implementation of this bundle.A systematic search of PubMed, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL provided evidence for a practice change for central line maintenance for our nontunneled central lines. During project implementation, infection and dislodgement rates for both tunneled and nontunneled lines were examined in order have a control and intervention group.Prior to central line maintenance bundle implementation, there were 19 total incidences of central line dislodgements and 5 central line infections (14 dislodgements and 4 infections were from nontunneled lines, 5 dislodgements and 1 infection from a tunneled line). Postintervention there were 1 total dislodgement and 4 central line infections (the dislodgement was from a nontunneled line and all infections were from tunneled lines).Although research has shown frequent, scheduled dressing changes using the chlorhexidine patch decreases infection rates, the risk of dislodgement and skin breakdown for NICU infants outweighs the potential benefit of decreased infection.Further research is needed to determine whether this central line maintenance bundle would be beneficial for tunneled central lines.",

    "abstract": "Gentle ventilation with optimal oxygenation is integral to prevention of chronic lung disease in the extremely low birth-weight (ELBW) infant. Various types of noninvasive ventilation are used in neonatal intensive care units worldwide. Bubble continuous positive airway pressure (BCPAP) has been in use in newborn intensive care since 1975.To synthesize the current evidence on the use of BCPAP in the ELBW infant and its relationship to outcomes, particularly morbidity and mortality.A literature review was completed using PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane with a focus on BCPAP use in the ELBW population.No study found was exclusive to the ELBW population. All studies ranged from ELBW to full-term neonates. Studies supported the use of BCPAP in the ELBW, demonstrating decreased incidence of chronic lung disease and barotrauma through the use of oscillation and permissive hypercapnia.Literature supports the use of nasal bubble CPAP in the ELBW population. Barriers such as septal erosion, pneumothorax, inconsistent pressures, and air in the abdomen were identified and management recommendations were provided.Studies are needed comparing outcomes of nasal bubble CPAP use with other forms of CPAP in the ELBW infant, comparison of prongs to mask for nasal bubble CPAP, and comparing interventions to recommend optimal care bundles to prevent nasal septum injuries.",

Currently, in the United States, probiotic use within the NICU is limited despite being commonly used in other countries.To provide an overview of the current practices of using probiotics in preterm infants for the prevention of NEC in the NICU in preselected countries.A comprehensive literature search was conducted on PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov. Also, studies from 2 recent meta-analyses on the topic were reviewed for inclusion. Selection criteria were as follows: studies involving preterm infants using probiotics in the NICU, reporting on the impact of probiotic use on the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis, published within the last 10 years and in the English language, and originating from the United States, Canada, or any European country.Twenty-three studies were selected. The most common types of probiotics used were Bifidobacterium infantis and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The most common frequency of administration was daily or twice day. Duration ranged from 10 days to the entire NICU stay. The dosage was commonly 1 billion colony-forming units daily but ranged from 12 million daily to 12 billion per kilogram daily.Examining the current practices of probiotic use in the NICU provides useful information as this adjunctive therapy rises in popularity.Refining methods of probiotic research for necrotizing enterocolitis prevention will improve safety and effectiveness and provide a framework for future clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Background: Jaundice is a common condition among preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Total serum bilirubin (TSB) offers a gold standard tool for measurement, but blood sampling can be costly, time-consuming, and not without risks of infection and pain. Transcutaneous bilimeter (TcB) allows for noninvasive assessment of bilirubin. However, due to questions of accuracy the use of the TcB in preterm infants receiving phototherapy has not been widely adapted in the NICU. Purpose: To systematically review studies that measure TcB versus TSB bilirubin in preterm infants who are receiving phototherapy. Methods: A systematic electronic search of databases (CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane, Medline, PubMed) was completed for English language publications. No date limitation was placed on the search. Inclusion criteria were based on preterm infants that were in the NICU receiving or had recently received phototherapy. Results: Nine studies of different quantitative study designs were reviewed. A good to strong correlation between TcB and TSB in preterm infants receiving phototherapy was demonstrated. There was a stronger correlation found in studies that examined TcB in unexposed skin areas during phototherapy. Implications for Practice: TcB may allow for a reduction in blood sampling, which would reduce painful procedures, reduce the risk of infection and anemia resulting from repeated blood sampling. It also acts as a more time and cost-efficient measurement tool. Implications for Research: Larger scaled quantitative studies on the accuracy of TcB in preterm infants receiving phototherapy are needed to provide more evidence-based data and guide clinical practice on this topic.",

    "abstract": "Background Skin-to-skin care (SSC) has been integrated as an essential component of developmental care for preterm infants. Despite documented benefits, SSC is not routinely practiced in the cardiac and surgical neonatal intensive care unit, with a predominantly term population, due to staff apprehension, patient factors and acuity, and environmental constraints. Purpose: The purpose of this quality improvement project was to increase SSC, parental holds, and parent touch events for infants in our cardiac and surgical neonatal intensive care unit. When traditional SSC was not possible, alternative holds and alternative parent touch (APT) methods were encouraged. Methods: Quality improvement and qualitative descriptive methodology were utilized to assess baseline, develop education and practice changes, and evaluate the use of SSC, holds, and APT methods at 12 and 18 months postintervention. Implementation included educational tools and resource development, simulations, peer champions, in-class teaching, and team huddles. Decisions around the type of hold and parent touch were fluid and reflected complex infant, family, staff, and physical space needs. Findings: Given its initial scarcity, there was an increased frequency of SSC and variety of holds or APT events. Staff survey results indicated support for the practice and outlined persistent barriers. Implications for Practice: Skin-to-skin care, holds, and APT practices are feasible and safe for term and preterm infants receiving highly instrumented and complex cardiac and surgical care. Implications for Research: Future research regarding the intervention's impact on neurodevelopmental outcomes of infants and on parent resilience in the surgical and cardiac neonatal intensive care unit is warranted.",

The estimated neonatal incidence of 0.1% to 0.2% may be misrepresented secondary to missed or misdiagnosis. Undiagnosed WPW can result in sudden cardiac death.To discuss the pathogenesis, manifestations, diagnosis, management, and lifespan implications of WPW in the prenatal and postnatal periods.A literature review was conducted using PubMed, CINAHL, and Google Scholar (2013-2019). Search terms included (newborn OR infant), wolff parkinson white, pathogenesis, management, and ventricular preexcitation. After removal of duplicates, 267 references were identified, abstracts reviewed, and 30 publications fully evaluated.Separation of the heart chambers begins around 7 weeks' gestation with formation of the annulus fibrosis complete after term. The unknown external environmental influence on the development of the preterm infant's CCS places neonates at risk for persistent atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia with WPW development. Ensuring an appropriate diagnosis is crucial, as an incorrect diagnosis could mean death.Due to the rarity of WPW, any fetal or neonatal supraventricular tachycardia requires further evaluation with an electrocardiogram and involvement of an experienced cardiologist for diagnosis. One episode of supraventricular tachycardia warrants evaluation for WPW, as recurring episodes may result in irreversible damage.The recommendations for treatment of WPW in the prenatal and immediate postnatal periods are based heavily on standards of care for the adult population. A paucity of evidenced-based literature exists and future research is crucial to understand the true incidence, physiologic effects, and lifespan implications of WPW on neonates.",

Supportive KC devices may be an important tool clinicians can use to assist parents with KC. In recent years, there has been a rise in the availability of KC devices. However, the use, needs, and preferences for these supportive devices by neonatal clinicians have not been documented. Purpose: To survey clinicians' use, needs, and preferences of KC supportive devices, and examine whether differences exist based on clinician and organizational characteristics. Methods: A cross-sectional, online survey was sent through neonatal organization Web sites, conferences, and social media. Results: Many clinicians (n = 68, 43%; N = 158) facilitated KC with a supportive device, with 81% of devices provided by the clinician's employer. The most important “Must Have” feature of a KC device was “Safety: Reduces patient falls if caregiver sleeps or needs to use hands” (84% of respondents) followed by washability (82%), and “immediate, effective access to the baby” (78%). Clinicians' responses did not differ based on hospital setting, type of unit, KC experience, or experience using a KC device. Implications for Practice: To support safe use of KC devices in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) clinical care, a device must hold the proper KC position consistently, allow immediate access to the infant, and hold the infant in place without the parent's hands to prevent falls. Training is needed to ensure safe device use. Implications for Research: Future research should evaluate the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of these devices.",

    "abstract": "Background: There has been an increase in infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) over the past several decades. Infants with NAS experience withdrawal as a result of the sudden termination at birth of substance exposure during pregnancy. A serious sign related to infants diagnosed with NAS is poor feeding. The prevalence of NAS urges researchers and clinicians to develop effective strategies and techniques to treat and manage the poor feeding of infants exposed to substances in utero. Purpose: To synthesize current feeding methods and practices used for infants diagnosed with NAS. Methods/Search Strategy: PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus were searched for articles published within the last 20 years that focused on feeding practices or feeding schedules, were written in English, were peer-reviewed, and described human studies. The search terms utilized were “neonatal abstinence syndrome” OR “neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome” AND “feeding.” Findings/Results: Three findings emerged regarding techniques and management of poor feeding in the NAS population. The findings included infants who received mother's own milk had decreased severity and later onset of clinical signs of withdrawal, demand feeding is recommended, and the infant's cues may be helpful to follow when feeding. Implications for Practice: Clinicians should encourage mother's own milk in this population unless contraindications are present. Caregivers and clinicians must be receptive to cues when feeding infants with NAS. Implications for Research: Even with the clinical knowledge and experience that infants with NAS are difficult to feed, there is limited research assessing techniques and schedules that are effective in managing successful feeding. Future research should compare feeding schedules such as on-demand feeding versus regimented feeding schedules, as well as investigate techniques that mothers and nurses can utilize to encourage oral intake in this population.

Donor human milk (DHM) availability and NEC rates were assessed.From 2009 to 2016, NICUs with DHM increased from 0 to 7. VLBW infants discharged on any HM increased from 35% in 2007 before the formation of the New Jersey NICU Collaborative to more than 55% in 2016. Time to first oropharyngeal colostrum decreased from 37 to 30 hours from 2014 to 2016. HM at first feeding increased from 71% in 2013 to 82% in 2016. There was an increase in the percentage of feeds that were HM over the first 7 days of feeding. Analyses of data from 9400 VLBW infants born between 2009 and 2016 showed that the incidence of NEC when DHM was not available was 5.1% (367/7182) whereas the incidence when DHM was available (64/2218) was significantly lower (2.9%; P < .0001).These findings show advantages of feeding HM and effectiveness of forming an NICU collaborative for improving care for preterm infants.New research projects should measure the quantity of HM consumed daily during the entire NICU stay and assess the timing and amount of HM consumption in relationship to incidence of NEC and infection in neonates.",

PURPOSE: To explore the significance of and the circumstances that affect lactation for mothers of premature infants. METHODS: A qualitative exploratory study based on single, in-depth, semistructured interviews with 16 purposefully sampled mothers of premature infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Data were analyzed using content analysis. The study was reported according to Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research. FINDINGS: The overall theme was \"From expressing human milk to breastfeeding-an essential element in the journey to motherhood.\" The theme emerged from 3 categories: the birth preparation time has been interrupted; expressing human milk is essential for lactation; and the motherhood journey encompasses breastfeeding. The analysis also revealed that the categories were impacted by initiating, performing, and maintaining lactation and further influenced by inhibitors and promoters. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The promoters for performing milk expression and breastfeeding should be stimulated and the inhibitors should be eliminated. The achievement of \"zero separation\" and mother-infant couplet care in the NICU would be beneficial. In order for mothers to maintain successful lactation, it is essential that they receive supportive around-the-clock access to health professionals with expertise in lactation and breastfeeding until exclusive breastfeeding is well established. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: The study highlights the need to investigate mother-infant as one entity rather than separately as mother and infant.",

Protocols guiding feeding practices can improve outcomes, but significant variation exists between institutions, which may limit their utility. To be most effective, protocols should be based on the best available evidence. Purpose: To examine the state of the science on several key components of feeding protocols for VLBW infants. Search Strategy: The authors searched PubMed, CINAHL, and EMBASE databases for terms related to feeding VLBW infants less than 32 weeks' gestational age, including initiation of feedings, rate of feeding advancement, timing of human milk (HM) fortification, and feeding during blood transfusions, when diagnosed with a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and during medical treatment of PDA closure. Results: Initiation of feeds within the first 3 days of life and advancement by 30 mL/kg/d may decrease time to attain full feeds without increasing complications. Insufficient evidence guides optimal timing of HM fortification, as well as feeding infants undergoing blood transfusions, infants diagnosed with a PDA, and infants receiving medical treatment of PDA closure. Implications for Practice: Integration of existing research regarding feeding initiation and advancement into feeding protocols may improve outcomes. Infants at highest risk of feeding-related complications may benefit from a personalized feeding approach. Implications for Research: Additional research is needed to provide evidence concerning the optimal timing of HM fortification and feeding strategies for infants undergoing blood transfusions and those diagnosed with a PDA or receiving medical treatment of PDA closure to incorporate into evidence-based feeding protocols.",

The purpose of this study is to explore experiences and instances of emotional closeness from the perspective of fathers as well as factors influencing emotional closeness during an infant's hospitalization in the neonatal unit.This qualitative descriptive study employed one-on-one interviews with fathers recruited in a level 3 neonatal unit. The interview data were analyzed with thematic analysis, and emerging themes and subthemes were organized according to dimensional analysis.Eight fathers agreed to take part in this study. According to the participants, emotional closeness was a complex process composed of multiple dimensions. More specifically, emotional closeness was a difficult-to-describe, mixed, and growing feeling influenced by multiple factors such as the environment, co-parenting, and the father-infant relationship. It occurred in the contexts of presence and separation in the neonatal unit and was part of the development of the father-infant relationship.The results presented in this article are important for neonatal intensive care unit nurses who support fathers in the development of their fathering role. By knowing more about the process and dimensions of emotional closeness, nurses can direct their interventions with fathers to enhance emotional closeness and better understand their experience.No previous study has addressed emotional closeness as a complex process with multiple components like the current study. These findings contribute to our understanding of the process of emotional closeness for fathers.",

The goals of these noninvasive ventilation techniques are to improve gas exchange in the premature infant's lungs and to minimize the need for intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation.The goals of this article are to consider various uses of nasal interfaces, discuss skin care and developmental positioning concerns faced by the bedside nurse, and discuss the medical management aimed to reduce morbidity and mortality. This article explores the nursing role, the advances in medical strategies for noninvasive ventilation, and the team approach to noninvasive ventilation use in this population.Search strategy included a literature review on medical databases, such as EBSCOhost, CINAHL, PubMed, and NeoReviews.Innovative products, nursing research on developmental positioning and skin care, and advanced medical management have led to better and safer outcomes for premature infants requiring noninvasive ventilation.The medical focus of avoiding long-term mechanical ventilation would not be possible without the technology to provide noninvasive ventilation to these premature infants and the watchful eye of the nurse in terms of careful positioning, preventing skin breakdown and facial scarring, and a proper seal to maximize ventilation accuracy.This article encourages nursing-based research to quantify some of the knowledge about skin care and positioning as well as research into most appropriate uses for noninvasive ventilation devices.",

These symptoms frequently result in feeding difficulties and family stress. Management of symptoms across healthcare disciplines may not be based on current evidence, and inconsistency can result in confusion for families and delayed interventions. The feeding relationship between infant and caregivers may be impaired when symptoms are persistent and poorly managed. An algorithm for managing gastroesophageal reflux-like symptoms in very low-birth-weight infants (from hospital discharge to 12 months corrected age) was developed through the formation of a multidisciplinary community of practice and critical appraisal of the literature. A case study demonstrates how the algorithm results in a consistent approach for identifying symptoms, applying appropriate management strategies, and facilitating appropriate timing of medical consultation. Application to managing gastroesophageal reflux symptoms in the neonatal intensive care unit will be briefly addressed.",

Neonates are often left susceptible to the forces of their environment, leaving them open to infection when skin injury occurs. Leptospermum honey has been used successfully in adult patients, with evidence lacking in the neonatal population. This case demonstrates the management of a difficult-to-heal wound in a 23-week gestation infant.Selecting the proper treatment and products for wound healing is challenging, with little evidence-based research available for the treatment of neonatal wounds. Leptospermum honey and other adult-driven dressings have been used for neonatal wound care as well as other adult-driven dressings. This case demonstrates the benefits of Leptospermum honey as an option for neonatal wounds.This case presents the treatment and healing of an extensive wound of a 23-week gestation neonate using a hydrogel product initially and then transitioning to a Leptospermum honey dressing due to suboptimal healing. Results of this treatment included quick healing time, little to no scarring, and no loss of movement or function to the affected extremities.The incorporation of Leptospermum honey for wound care has the potential to promote faster wound healing, with less scarring in the neonatal population.Adult wound care principles have been applied in the face of a weak evidence base relating to neonatal-specific cases. There is a need for continued research related to moist wound healing in the neonatal population, with resulting product and practice recommendations.",

    "abstract": "Background: Implicit bias permeates beliefs and actions both personally and professionally and results in negative health outcomes for people of color—even in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). NICU clinicians may naïvely and incorrectly assume that NICU families receive unbiased care. Existing evidence establishing associations between sex, race, and neonatal outcomes may perpetuate the tendency to deny racial bias in NICU practice. Evidence Acquisition: Using the socioecological model as a framework, this article outlines evidence for racial health disparities in the NICU on multiple levels—societal, community, institutional, interpersonal, and individual. Using current evidence and recommendations from the National Association of Neonatal Nurses Position Statement on “Racial Bias in the NICU,” appropriate interventions and equitable responses of the NICU clinician are explored. Results: Based on current evidence, clinicians should reject the notion that the social construct of race is the root cause for certain neonatal morbidities. Instead, clinicians should focus on the confluence of medical and social factors contributing to each individual infant's progress. This critical distinction is not only important for clinicians employing life-saving interventions, but also for those who provide routine care, developmental care, and family education—as these biases can and do shape clinical interactions. Implications for Practice and Research: Healthcare practitioners have an ethical and moral responsibility to maintain up-to-date knowledge of new evidence that impacts our clinical practice. The evidence demonstrates the importance of recognizing the enduring role of racism in the health and well-being of people of color and the need to adjust care accordingly.",

The survey was posted online for about 3 months on the Web site of a professional organization of neonatal nurses.Of the 78 neonatal nurses who responded to the survey, 39% were very familiar with the term antibiotic stewardship . The majority of participants did not question the treating provider about the choice, route, or dose of antibiotics. The majority also agreed that more education is needed to achieve the goal of incorporating principles of antibiotic stewardship more fully into practice in the neonatal intensive care unit.Results suggest that although most nurses are familiar with the term antibiotic stewardship , they would like to have more education on the appropriate use of antibiotics.Further studies are needed to identify nurse involvement in applying the principles of antibiotic stewardship programs while working with the vulnerable population of preterm infants.",

A publicly available parent-targeted video demonstrates breastfeeding, skin-to-skin care, and sucrose during painful procedures. Australian parents' use and knowledge of this video and these strategies was unknown. Purpose: To determine parents' use of pain management strategies, and perceived acceptability and usefulness of the parent-targeted video. Methods: A cross-sectional, online, anonymous survey with embedded video. Participants were recruited via social media channels of the Miracle Babies Foundation, an Australian parent support network. Target participants were parents or family members of infants currently or previously hospitalized in neonatal special and/or intensive care nurseries, or high dependency units. Results: A total of 162 of 189 respondents provided sufficient data for analysis; all identified as mothers. Only 6 (4%) had previously seen the video; however, nearly all rated it as potentially useful and helpful (n = 124, 82%). Although most reported that sucrose had been used (n = 112, 84%), fewer reported having used skin-to-skin care (n = 50, 37%), or breastfeeding (n = 33, 25%). Most intended to advocate for skin-to-skin care (n = 108, 88%) or breastfeeding (n = 100, 81%) in future procedures. Perceived barriers to utilizing strategies included lack of information-sharing and organizational practices that excluded parent involvement. Implications for Practice and Research: The video may be valuable in supporting mothers to advocate for their involvement during painful procedures in preterm and sick hospitalized infants. Further research is recommended to explore coordinated strategies targeting parents and healthcare professionals to overcome barriers to implementing parent-led infant pain management strategies.",

    "abstract": "In their article \"A Quality Improvement Project to Reduce Events of Visitor Escalation in the Intensive Care Nursery\" (Vol 22, No. 1), the authors make repeated references to \"visitors\" to the neonatal intensive care nursery (NICU). As seasoned healthcare professionals and advocates for parents of premature and sick infants, our position is this: Parents are not visitors. Parents are parents—their child's first and most important caregiver.1 Globally, healthcare organizations have traditionally positioned parents as visitors. This language is used not just in articles like this one but also frequently present in hospital documents, signage, and in the ways parents are spoken to and about in the hospital. Preterm birth is traumatic. Often unexpected and unplanned, a preterm delivery to a medically fragile infant can leave a mother feeling like her body has failed. Parents are typically separated immediately from their infant, robbing them of that \"moment\" they have been waiting for—the moment they become parents. In the hours and days that follow, parents may not be allowed to hold or touch their infant. The clinical terms used to talk about their infant seem like a foreign language, everything is unfamiliar and sterile, and parents do not have any idea what to say, do, or ask. Parents of premature and sick infants are scared and anxious. They can feel powerless, alienated, alone—outsiders in their own infant's life.1,2 Therefore, language is so important. Calling parents visitors contributes to a culture of experts versus guests and us versus them.3 It evokes feelings for parents that this is the hospital's infant, not your infant.4 Healthcare professionals decide who can touch and care for your infant, when, and for how long. The word \"visitor\" and how we use it to describe parents—in writing as well as verbally—is simply inaccurate. Parents are an infant's primary caregiver. The words we use, as well as our tone, body language, and communication style, strongly affect how healthcare professionals see parents—and how parents see themselves. The culture of \"allowing\" parents' permission to care for their premature or sick infants must shift. Instead, healthcare providers' words, actions, and knowledge should be a tool for helping parents learn to care for their sick newborn, build trust and rapport, and enable open communication.5 The first days and weeks in the NICU are formative for the parent–infant relationship and can make or break parents' feelings of confidence, competence, and connection to their new infant. Parents must be at the center of a premature or sick infant's care team.6,7 Changing the language, we use, to talk about parents is a simple, cost-effective way to promote a culture of inclusion and involvement and improve outcomes. Looking at the wording in unit policies, notice boards, signage, parent education materials, staff presentations, in-services, training, and orientation is a good start. Calling parents \"visitors\" is exclusionary. Parents are not visiting. Parents are parenting. —Marianne Bracht, RN, RSCN Pediatrics Mount Sinai Hospital Toronto, Ontario, Canada —Linda S.

    "abstract": "Background: Of all preterm births, approximately 82% are moderate to late preterm. Moderate to late preterm infants are often treated like full-term infants despite their physiological and metabolic immaturity, increasing their risk for mortality and morbidity. Purpose: To describe the relationship between routine caregiving methods and physiological markers of stress and hypoxemia in infants born between 32 and 36 6/7 weeks' gestation. Methods: This descriptive study used a prospective observational design to examine the relationship between routine caregiving patterns (single procedure vs clustered care) and physiological markers of stress and hypoxemia such as regional oxygen saturation, quantified as renal and cerebral regional oxygen saturation (StO 2 ), systemic oxygen saturation (Sp o 2 ), and heart rate (HR) in moderate to late preterm infants. Renal and cerebral StO 2 was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy during a 6-hour study period. Sp o 2 and HR were measured using pulse oximetry. Results: A total of 231 procedures were captured in 37 participants. We found greater alterations in cerebral StO 2 , renal StO 2 , Sp o 2 , and HR when routine procedures were performed consecutively in clusters than when procedures were performed singly or separately. Implications for Practice and Research: Our results suggest that the oxygen saturation and HR of moderate to late preterm infants were significantly altered when exposed to routine procedures that were performed consecutively, in clusters, compared with when exposed to procedures that were performed singly or separately. Adequately powered randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the type of caregiving patterns that will optimize the health outcomes of this vulnerable population.",

    "abstract": "Background: Admission rates of Hispanic/Latinx families to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are rising, yet knowledge regarding their experiences is limited. Non-English-speaking families are often excluded from research because study measures are not available in their language. The inclusion of these families in NICU research is crucial to understand the impact of cultural and language barriers in infant and family care, and the translation of study measures into Spanish could better ensure that these families' perspectives are included. However, previous research has utilized the standard translation–backtranslation method with which problems have been noted. Purpose: This article describes the planning, preparation, and action phases that were completed with the use of a community advisory board (CAB) to prepare and transcreate research study materials from English to Spanish for pilot testing. Methods: Community members of interest were invited to form the CAB, and 2 meetings were held to review study materials in the English and Spanish versions. Prior to the second meeting, a professional translation company translated study materials from English to Spanish. Results: Feedback from the CAB ensured consistent content and reading levels, and culturally appropriate language usage. The CAB also provided suggestions to the research protocol and advised sensitive methods of recruitment and measure administration. Implications for Practice and Research: More accurate and culturally appropriate transcreation of study measures can reduce barriers to research participation and facilitate better communication with non-English-speaking families in health equity research to better inform evidence-based interventions and clinical practices across diverse groups.",

Formal evidence on professional and personal caregiver perspectives of this intervention is lacking. Purpose: This survey study evaluates the HeartSong music therapy intervention from parent and staff perspectives. Methods: A qualitative study assessing inclusion of HeartSong for family neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) care surveyed 10 professional caregivers comprising medical and psychosocial NICU teams anonymously reflecting their impressions of the intervention. Digital survey of parents/guardians contacted through semistructured phone interviews relayed impressions of recordings: subsequent setup, Song of Kin selection, and use of HeartSong, including thoughts/feelings about it as an intervention. Results: Professional and personal caregivers valued the HeartSong intervention for bereavement support, family support, including parental, extended family/infant support, and to enhance bonding. Emergent themes: memory-making, connectedness/closeness, support of parent role, processing mental health needs of stressful NICU days, and subsequent plans for lifelong HeartSong use. Therapeutic experience was named as a crucial intervention aspect and participants recommended the HeartSong as a viable, accessible NICU intervention. Implications for Practice and Research: HeartSong's use showed efficacy as a clinical NICU music therapy intervention for families of critically ill and extremely preterm infants, when provided by trained, specialized, board-certified music therapists. Future research focusing on HeartSong in other NICU populations might benefit infants with cardiac disease, parental stress, and anxiety attending to parent–infant bonding. Costs and time benefits related to investment are needed before implementation is considered.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parents' participation in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) reduces length of stay and positively affects infants' psychological, cognitive, and behavioural outcomes. Healthcare professionals in the NICU focus on both parents, but tend to have the main focus on the mother and the infant. Therefore, fathers may experience a lack of support and feel that they are being disregarded in the NICU. PURPOSE: To study fathers' experiences with father groups during NICU admission with their preterm infant. The father group is a 90-minute intervention based on dialogue between fathers and a male healthcare professional. METHODS: A qualitative content analysis was conducted using 10 online semistructured interviews with fathers participating in a father group. The study was reported according to the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research. RESULTS: The overall theme emerging from our analysis was \"Emotional support, encouragement, and an enhanced capacity to deal with the situation and with life in the NICU.\" This theme emerged from the categories \"Meeting with peers and sharing reflections\" and \"Fathers' territory\" based on 5 subcategories. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Participation in father groups gives fathers recognition for being important as parents in the NICU, improves fathers' mental well-being, and enhances their coping capacity. Father groups support fathers in the NICU and can be integrated into NICU practices and policies to enhance a family-centered approach. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: This study revealed a need for further research to determine whether participation in a father group has a measurable effect on clinical outcomes.",

Furthermore, frequency tables and qualitative analyses were employed.The survey was completed by 427 participants from 34 hospitals in 25 Dutch cities. While healthcare professionals reported sleep to be especially important for neonates admitted in the NICU, low scores were achieved in the area of knowledge of sleep physiology. Most healthcare professionals (91.8%) adapted the timing of elective care procedures to sleep. However, sleep assessments were not based on scientific knowledge. Therefore, the difference between active sleep and wakefulness may often be wrongly assessed. Finally, sleep is rarely discussed between colleagues (27.4% regularly/always) and during rounds (7.5%-14.3% often/always).Knowledge about sleep physiology should be increased through education among neonatal healthcare professionals. Furthermore, sleep should be considered more often during rounds and handovers.",

However, factors predicting subsequent NICU stress exposure have not been identified. Purpose: To characterize NICU stressors experienced by preterm infants during the first 2 weeks of life and identify demographic, perinatal, and institutional variables associated with stress exposure. Methods: A secondary analysis of data from a nonexperimental, prospective study was conducted using data from 60 very preterm infants born 28 to 31 weeks gestational age. Stress exposures during the first 2 weeks of life, operationalized as number of invasive procedures, were characterized by type and quantity for each infant using data extracted from electronic health records. Associations between number of invasive procedures and demographic, perinatal, or institutional variables were analyzed using linear regressions with robust standard errors. Results: Preterm infants experienced, on average, 98 (SD = 41.8) invasive procedures. Of these invasive procedures, nasal and/or oral suctioning episodes (58.1%), followed by skin-breaking procedures (32.6%), were most frequent. Differences in the number of invasive procedures were found for maternal race; infants born to Black mothers experienced fewer total invasive procedures than infants born to White mothers. The number of invasive procedures also varied across NICUs. Implications for Practice and Research: Preterm infant stress exposure differed by maternal race and NICU, consistent with research findings of differential treatment of diverse infants. Further research is needed to understand the reasons for these differences and to identify best practices to standardize neonatal care.",

Using 16S rRNA sequencing, we compared α- and β-diversity with the Shannon and Chao indexes and nonmetric multidimensional scaling, respectively, and relative abundance of microbial communities, which refers to the percentage of specific organisms in a community, from mother's chest skin, preterm infant's oral cavity, and preterm infant's stool samples. Effects of STS care on vertical transmission were determined by comparing oral and stool microbial population of preterm infants who received low exposure (<40 minutes) with that of preterm infants who received high exposure (>60 minutes).Microbial composition, diversity, and relative abundance were different across the 3 sites. Oral microbial richness was less and stool richness was greater among the preterm infants in the high STS care group. Oral and intestinal microbial diversity and composition were different between the groups, with the relative abundance of Gemella and Aggregatibacter genera and Lachnospiraceae family significantly greater in the stool of the high STS care group.Results suggest that STS care may be an effective method to enhance microbial communities among preterm infants.",

    "abstract": "Background: During the first interaction between the father and the infant, touch can be very important especially father–infant skin-to-skin contact. Few studies have focused on the effect of kangaroo care (KC) on paternal attachment. Purpose: This randomized controlled study was conducted to determine the effect of KC on paternal attachment. Methods: A total of 90 fathers of healthy newborns, including 45 in the intervention group and 45 in the control group who met the inclusion criteria, were included randomly in the study. Data were collected using the Introductory Information Form at study admission and the Father–Infant Attachment Scale (FIAS) at 3 months of age. T test, Mann–Whitney U test, and Kruskal–Wallis test were used for statistical analysis. Results: The mean FIAS scores for the intervention group (I) were higher than for the control group (C) (I: 80.57 ± 13.70; C: 56.76 ± 13.23) ( P &lt; .05). Patience and tolerance (I: 13.70 ± 1.18; C: 11.57 ± 2.30), pleasure in interaction (I: 29.50 ± 2.86; C: 17.13 ± 5.93), and love and pride (I: 37.37 ± 2.85; C: 28.06 ± 5.82) mean scores for FIAS subdimensions in the intervention group were also higher than in the control group ( P &lt; .05). Implications for Practice and Research: Findings of this study demonstrate that KC has the potential to increase paternal attachment. Healthcare providers should provide discharge education for fathers on KC to increase father–infant attachment. There is a need for studies with larger samples in different cultures on the factors related to parents that affect father–infant attachment and evidence-based practices that increase attachment.",

    "abstract": "Background: Across the globe, family-integrated care (FICare) has become an evidence-based standard in which parents deliver the majority of infant care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Because of extensive barriers to parent presence, adaptations to FICare may be required for successful implementation. Family management theory may provide structure to the Parent Education of FICare and help nurses guide parents’ skill development as equal care members. Purpose: To identify family management skills employed by NICU parents using the Self- and Family Management Framework (SFMF). Methods: We conducted secondary analyses of qualitative interview data from NICU parents (n = 17) who shared their experiences of using family management skills to care for their infant. We categorized skills according to 3 main self- and family management processes: Focusing on Infant Illness Needs; Activating Resources; and Living With Infant Illness. Results: Parents reported several family management skills currently identified in the SFMF, as well as new skills such as conflict management, power brokerage, and addressing resources related to social determinants of health. Parent activation of resources was critical to sustaining parent focus on the infant's illness needs. Implications for Practice and Research: By teaching skills that parents reported as helping them manage infant care, neonatal nurses may better facilitate parent integration into the care team. Future researchers can incorporate the skills identified in this study into the design of family management interventions that facilitate FICare implementation in the United States.",

The classic location and progressive erythema, warmth, induration, and tenderness in the submandibular region strongly suggested the diagnosis of group B streptococcal (GBS) cellulitis. Despite the presence of concurrent GBS septicemia, the infant had complete resolution of focal and systemic symptoms with 10 days of treatment. One month later, the infant developed pneumonia with respiratory failure, shock, culture-positive septicemia, and presumed meningitis and was again treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Diagnosis at that time was late-onset group B streptococcal infection.

Motivating factors to become an NNP, challenges facing NNPs, and rewards of the NNP role from the perspectives of NICU nurses were explored.The convenience sample was obtained using 2 survey techniques. The first sample group included nurses who were employed in Level III NICUs located within 2 major Midwestern cities. In order to confirm the data and to expand the scope, the second sample group was recruited from NICU nurses who were attending a regional educational conference. All participants were currently employed NICU nurses and were therefore potential NNP students. Combining the participants of both enrollment techniques resulted in a potential of 696 subjects.A simple self-administered survey was used to collect data. Narrative data were qualitatively analyzed. Demographic data and categorical items were quantified.This study achieved a total 30% response rate (n = 209). Of the total participants, only 32% of Level III NICU nurses were interested in becoming an NNP. Analysis of the data revealed 6 major categories (themes) of reasons why nurses were not interested in the NNP role. The themes most often mentioned by the participants were (1) obligations to family and/or work (46%) and (2) too much responsibility in the NNP role (30%). The data also revealed several different rewards and challenges for those in the NNP role as well as factors that may motivate nurses to become an NNP.Given the current NNP shortage, an increase in the supply of NNPs for the workforce is imperative. Current enrollment in NNP academic programs does not appear to be meeting the demand. Exploring the factors that influence enrollment in NNP programs from the perspective of potential NNP students is the first step towards increasing the supply of NNPs. The majority of participants were not interested in becoming an NNP for a variety of reasons. Negative perceptions of the NNP role were identified. Solutions posed from these results may provide scientifically sound solutions to help ease the shortage of NNPs. The findings of this naturalistic inquiry may be used to develop an instrument to measure interest in the NNP role.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE This study examined the degree to which birthweight, gestational age, fetal drug exposure, hazardous postnatal medical events, and a mother's predisposition toward touch predicted the likelihood of an infant's tactile vulnerability during nursing care. SUBJECTS The convenience sample included 99 hospitalized infants in their second week of life and their mothers. DESIGN The design was correlational. METHODS A standardized observational assessment was used to code the infant's physiological and behavioral responses to touch during 4 different episodes of nursing care. Chart review was performed to collect information regarding fetal drug exposure, birthweight, gestational age, and postnatal medical events. Mothers completed a questionnaire regarding their own comfort with using touch and being touched. MEASURES The Tactile Vulnerability Assessment measured infant reactivity to and tolerance for touch during nursing care. The Postnatal Complications Scale identified hazardous medical conditions and treatments experienced by the infant during the first 2 weeks of life, and the Physical Contact Assessment evaluated a mother's predisposition toward touch. RESULTS The number of hazardous postnatal medical events experienced by an infant was the primary predictor of tactile vulnerability, accounting for 28% of the variance in the infant's likelihood of developing hyperarousal and distress from touch during care. Illicit fetal drug exposure and maternal predisposition toward touch were also significant predictors. CONCLUSIONS The significant relationship of postnatal medical events to tactile vulnerability suggests that it may be associated with the presence of infant pain or injury to the infant's central nervous system. Symptoms of drug withdrawal and the impact of teratogens on arousal regulation may also be implicated in greater distress from touch by infants. In addition, findings suggest the potential for inherited transmission of a vulnerability to touch. Assessment of infant vulnerability, including discussion with parents about their views of the infant's needs regarding touch, may enhance problem identification and early intervention to reduce infant distress and further medical problems.",

In these infants, feeding tolerance might improve after oral administration of enterocyte growth factors in a sterile, isotonic, noncaloric solution patterned after human amniotic fluid. STUDY DESIGN Ten infants who met the study criteria for feeding intolerance were enrolled in this pilot trial. The test solution was administered, 2.5 mL/kg every 3 hours, until 80 mL/kg/day of milk feedings were tolerated, or for a maximum of 7 days. When milk feedings were prescribed, they were mixed with the test solution. Volumes of milk feedings were increased in amounts determined by the attending neonatologist and neonatal nurse practitioner. The outcome was the net average enteral kilocalories per kilogram of body weight per day (kcal/kg/day) for 3 periods: (1) the 3 days before the test treatment was begun, (2) the days the test treatment was administered, and (3) the 7 days following cessation of the test treatment. RESULTS At study entry the infants' chronological ages ranged from 3 to 65 days. All infants tolerated the test solution, which was given for a mean of 5 days (range 3 to 7 days). During that period, the infants received more enteral calories (mean 18 kcal/kg/day, range 1 to 32) than during the preceding 3 day period (mean 3 kcal/kg/day, range 0 to 7, P < 0.05). During the 7 days following the test treatment the infants received 87 enteral kcal/kg/day (range 11 to 109, P < 0.02 compared to the treatment period). CONCLUSIONS In this Phase 1 pilot trial, 10 heterogeneous infants in the neonatal intensive care unit with feeding intolerance had a significant increase in milk feedings after treatment with a sterile, isotonic, noncaloric solution patterned after human amniotic fluid.",

The goals of CMV are to facilitate adequate gas exchange, minimize the risk of lung injury/damage, decrease the patient's work of breathing, and optimize the patient's comfort. Although time-cycled, pressure-limited ventilation remains the most common CMV modality, volume-cycled ventilation, assist-control ventilation, pressure-support ventilation, and pressure-control ventilation are sometimes used in the NICU. Pressure-regulated volume control, volume-guaranteed ventilation, volume-assured pressure-support ventilation, and proportional-assist ventilation are emerging hybrid modes of CMV. Although CMV is frequently life saving, it can cause complications if improperly used. Nurses are responsible for the ongoing assessment and care of infants undergoing CMV and are becoming frequently more involved in the weaning process of CMV.

    "abstract": "Most infants exposed to cytomegalovirus (CMV) in utero will not be symptomatic; however, infants born with symptomatic CMV will have more severe consequences and poorer prognosis than will asymptomatic infants. The timing of infection during pregnancy largely affects the expected outcomes and consequences to the fetus. It is possible for a fetus to acquire congenital CMV infection from a nonprimary infection, although this accounts for a small number of cases. The presence of microcephaly, intrauterine growth restriction, petechiae, encephalitis, hepatosplenomegaly, and deafness are some of the physical characteristics of a congenital CMV infection. Treatment options remain limited at this time, so no routine screening has been recommended. The need for a vaccine or preventative treatment has been identified as a priority in the United States.",

Infants and children have special characteristics such as skin immaturity, a high body surface to weight ratio, sensitivity to pain, increased potential for percutaneous absorption of medication, and an immature immune system that adds to the complexity of treating their wounds. The use of controlled topical negative pressure across a wound surface has been used in adults and children since 1995. Recently, the use of this device has been reported in neonates. This article discusses the normal process of wound healing and describes the use of this device in an infant with a giant omphalocele.",

The care practices investigated included suctioning frequency, assessment parameters, and techniques used to suction.A convenience sample of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) RNs and practicing RTs at 8 Midwestern hospitals in the United States caring for neonates on nasal CPAP in a level II or III NICU were included. Eighty-five percent of respondents were RNs of which almost 89% (88.6%) were staff RNs, 63% were bachelor prepared, and 33% of the RNs had greater than 20 years of neonatal nursing experience.A cross-sectional descriptive comparative design was used for this study.An investigator-developed Web-based survey pertaining to current practice concerns was developed by the research team. The 31-item survey tool consisted of 4 sections. The first section addressed the frequency of suctioning. The second section addressed assessment parameters used to determine the need for suctioning. The third section addressed the technique used to suction, including gloving techniques, hyperoxygenation, and the use of catheters in nares and mouth and suctioning devices. Demographic data, including staff position, level of education, years of nursing, and NICU experience and certification, were collected in the fourth section. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize demographics and each item of the survey. Chi-square statistics (Pearson chi-square and Fisher Exact text) were used to compare RNs' and RTs' nasal CPAP suctioning practices.The results of this study indicated that decision making related to the need to suction was variable. In addition, the frequency of suctioning and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal suctioning techniques were highly variable for neonates requiring nasal CPAP.Despite the treatment of respiratory distress with nasal CPAP, there are no best practice guidelines for providing nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal suctioning for maintenance of a patent airway. Future randomized controlled clinical trials are needed to develop best practices for nasal CPAP suctioning.",

A convenience sample of 35 very low-birth-weight infants from October 1, 2010, to April 30, 2011, was recruited during the prospective phase. A quasi-experimental design was used. A retrospective medical record review was performed to collect data on NICU admission rectal temperatures for the historical control group. During the prospective phase, infants were placed in a bag from the neck down immediately after birth and NICU admission rectal temperatures were recorded. In both groups, NICU rectal temperatures were measured immediately upon admission. Application of the bag resulted in a higher mean NICU admission rectal temperature in the intervention group compared with the historical control group. Occlusive bags applied at delivery decreased heat loss in premature infants. The results support previous findings and resulted in a change in clinical practice.",

These vulnerable infants may experience a long period of being NPO (nothing by mouth), followed by slowly advancing to enteral feeds. Human milk is the ideal method of nutrition for all infants and should be used to initiate enteral feeds in infants recovering from omphalocele closure surgeries. Human milk provides immunological, nutritional, and developmental benefits for high-risk infants and may play a critical role in preventing associated morbidities often associated with infants born with giant omphalocele. Because of the stress of hospitalization, mother-infant dyads should be targeted to receive extensive lactation support, which can help ensure maintenance of milk supply and successful transition to breastfeeding once the infant is healthy enough to do so. Two case studies are presented as exemplars, demonstrating that the provision of human milk for even the most vulnerable infants can be achieved.",

    "abstract": "Background: Early language exposure is critical for language acquisition and significantly influences a child's literacy skills. However, preterm infants may experience language deprivation in the neonatal intensive care unit. Nurses are vital to helping parents understand their critical role in early language development. Purpose: To discuss the impact of language-rich interactions and interventions that promote early language exposure, or Language Nutrition, by parents and caregivers on the long-term developmental, language, and educational outcomes of high-risk infants. Methods/Search Strategy: A literature search was conducted using PubMed and Web of Science to identify articles that examined the influence of language interactions with high-risk infants on developmental outcomes. Recent campaigns touting the importance of early language exposure were identified through the Bridging the Word Gap Research Network. Findings/Results: Increasing preterm infants' exposure to Language Nutrition improves their language development, promotes parent–infant attachment, and decreases parent stress. In addition, it may result in greater neuroplasticity and volume of the auditory cortex. Several campaigns have been developed to increase children's access to Language Nutrition and can be implemented into everyday pediatric and neonatal care. Implications for Practice: Pediatric, neonatal nurses and advanced practice nurses are uniquely positioned to play a transformational role in high-risk infants' developmental trajectory by educating parents about the importance of Language Nutrition and supporting parents as they engage with their infant. Implications for Research: Studies investigating the population-level impact of interventions aimed at increasing infants' access to Language Nutrition as well as studies identifying effective ways to communicate messages about Language Nutrition are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Background: Hospital-acquired pressure injuries (HAPIs) can be caused by multiple factors including pressure, shear, friction, moisture/incontinence, device-related pressure, immobility, inactivity, and nutritional deficits. Along with immobility, medical device-related (MDR) HAPIs are a primary cause of pressure injury in neonates, as the clinical practice setting has become increasingly technologically advanced. It is estimated that up to 50% of HAPIs are MDR in pediatric patients. Neonates are at particular risk for HAPI because of their specific anatomical, physiological, and developmental vulnerabilities. A specific example of confluent factors that may increase risk for HAPI is the application of therapeutic hypothermia (TH) and continuous electroencephalography monitoring for neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Interventions: An interprofessional team collaborated to expand upon existing evidence-based standards of care to address the needs of this specific population within the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Interventions centered on revision of current protocols, with efforts to optimize product selection, hardwire assessment practices, and refine documentation of patient care and outcomes. Methods: The team primarily utilized plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles to test and refine specific methods and strategies to reduce HAPIs. Tested solutions were adopted, adapted, or abandoned. Results: A sustained zero HAPI rate in the HIE population resulted. The team continues to collect, report, and utilize near-miss data to continue to refine the process as new risks are identified. Implications for Practice: Recognizing the unique skin protection needs of special populations within the NICU, such as those undergoing TH, is crucial. When evidence-based standards of care fail to adequately meet such needs, a collaborative approach to identifying, testing, and implementing population-specific solutions is essential. Implications for Research: A paucity of literature regarding the unique skin protection needs for babies undergoing TH exists. Work should be done to better describe the influence of TH on skin integrity, with the goal of identifying population-specific protective measures.",

Although vaccinations are a safe and effective measure to protect preterm infants from vaccine-preventable diseases, delays in vaccinations are not uncommon.The goal of this quality improvement project was to improve on time vaccinations of preterm infants hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit.The Plan-Do-Study-Act model of quality improvement was adopted to develop, test, and implement interventions aimed at improving timely vaccination of preterm infants. The primary outcome measure of interest was the rate of on time vaccination, which was defined as the proportion of medically eligible preterm infants who received vaccinations within 2 weeks of the recommended schedule.Baseline on time vaccination rate was only 36%. Following several Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles, a steady increase in on time vaccinations of eligible infants was observed, and a new baseline on time vaccination rate of 82% was achieved.Simple interventions implemented within the context of Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles are effective in improving timely vaccinations among preterm infants.Future research that focuses on vaccinations in preterm infants is needed to further reinforce the safety and efficacy of vaccines. Effective methods on how to disseminate and apply this knowledge to practice should also be studied.Video Abstract available at http://links.lww.com/ANC/A27.",

    "abstract": "Dear NANN Colleagues, Change is always occurring. As the coeditors for Advances in Neonatal Care, we are continually examining the neonatal landscape for ways to best deliver the journal content. Recently, we noticed that many journals publishing articles related to human milk science and breastfeeding medicine had updated their language. As with other practices around consistent terminology, we decided to examine the need to standardize the language used around this important content. Using consistent language sends a message of respect to the family as well as supports the importance of facilitating breastfeeding and the use of human milk, especially for high-risk infant populations where there is much to gain from the receipt of mother's own milk. Using standardized language also provides a means to explicitly shift away from using the term “breast.” By making these changes in our language, we are not continuing to objectify the “breast” as the center of attention but, rather, the attention should be on the delivery of human milk to the infant and the relationship that is developing/occurring during the feeding. To that end, we are instituting a change in our author guidelines. Beginning in 2018, we will not publish articles using the words “breast milk.” The use of the words “human milk,” “mother's own milk,” “father's own milk,” or “donor human milk” are now preferred. Human milk is 2 words. The use of the word “lactation” over “breastfeeding” is also preferred whenever possible. When the word “breastfeeding” is used, it should be used as a single word. Interestingly, we recently learned that breastfeeding translates in Spanish to lactation. The word “breast” does not come through in the translation. Using “breastfeeding” as a single word acknowledges the unique use of the breast for feeding. In addition, “nursing” should not be used in reference to breastfeeding. Consistent use of “lactating” or “breastfeeding” where appropriate sends a consistent message to parents and the community at large while “nursing” can take on different contexts. These changes are consistent with those being used by International Lactation Consultant Association (ILCA) Style Guidelines for Writing Professional Resources.1,2 The ILCA instituted these changes beginning in 2015 in its publications, and many journals related to this community have also adopted similar changes. Furthermore, “expressed milk” should be used over “pumped milk,” “expressing milk” instead of “pumping milk,” and “milk expression” instead of “pumping.” The use of “father,” “mother,” and “infant” rather than “dad,” “mom,” or “baby” will also be required as part of our new standards. These more formal terms are best for use in professional journals such as Advances in Neonatal Care. These changes will require some getting used to for all of us; yet, consistent use is important and respectful to those in our care. Authors who submit manuscripts with incorrect language will be asked to make these corrections during the manuscript revision process. Corrections could lengthen the revision process, so adhering to these changes before submission is important to getting your manuscript into print faster. Thank you for working with us to make these changes. How we refer to human milk is important; we should all be speaking about it the same way, so we support each other and we support families together, consistently.

HIV without adequate treatment during pregnancy can result in maternal to child transmission (MCT) of the virus. Sequelae can include severe lifelong morbidities, shorter life expectancies, and high mortality rates without antiretroviral therapy. Purpose: To discuss epidemiological trends, pathophysiology, and clinical care guidelines including those for diagnosis, treatment, and management of MCT of HIV in the United States. To emphasize the importance of prompt identification, prophylaxis, and treatment of at-risk infants. Methods: PubMed, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar were used to search key words—maternal to child transmission, HIV, HIV in pregnancy, and neonatal HIV—for articles that were relevant and current. The World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and UNICEF were also utilized for up-to-date information on the topic. Findings: Timely identification, intervention, and treatment are necessary to prevent MCT of HIV. Membrane rupture duration is not associated with higher transmission rates with adequate viral suppression. Implications for Practice: An evidence-based maternal/neonatal collaborative approach to care for the prevention and management of MCT of HIV including adherence to combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) should be emphasized. Early testing, prophylaxis, and treatment for neonates at risk, as well as education on current clinical care guidelines for caregivers. Implications for Research: Pregnancy complications of cART. MCT rates in conjunction with birthing practices and restrictions among women living with HIV with low to undetectable viral loads.",

Purpose: This report provides updated information and recommendations on testing, screening, and care for pregnant women and infants affected by ZIKV. Methods: Current published recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, and the American Academy of Pediatrics were reviewed and included in this report. Results: Although largely a self-limiting disease usually without symptoms, pregnant women and their fetuses are at greatest risk. Maternal transmission of ZIKV to the fetus can lead to congenital Zika infection with potentially devastating sequelae to the infant. The available evidence suggests that infection during the first trimester of pregnancy, in which the fetus' central nervous system is being formed, is associated with higher risk of brain abnormalities and perinatal loss. Implications for Practice: Uncertainties remain about the course of the disease, and the full spectrum of effects of the virus on the developing infant is not yet understood. Infants with congenital Zika syndrome need coordinated follow-up and long-term specialty care, as well as support for the family. Implications for Research: There is no known cure for ZIKV infection and no vaccine is currently available. The full spectrum of developmental disabilities and other adverse early childhood outcomes associated with congenital ZIKV infection needs to be studied.",

    "abstract": "Evidence supports the superiority of mother's own milk (MOM) in reducing the comorbidities common to prematurity and very low birth weight. In situations where an insufficient amount of MOM is available or maternal contraindications prevent its use, pasteurized donor human milk (DHM) is a viable substitution. When DHM is deemed best, a common practice in many neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) is for parents to provide their consent. However, no universal mandate for informed consent exists. Often, healthcare providers present and obtain the consent for DHM use prior to delivery or shortly after birth and this consent may be \"bundled\" along with other standardized NICU treatment consents. This approach is likely less than ideal since it provides insufficient time for decision making and often precedes the mother's ability to initiate the expression of her own milk.To review the history of DHM use and the ethics surrounding the consenting process including the ethical principles involved in infant feeding decision making. We argue for the standardization and consistent use of informed consent for DHM in the NICU and offer clinical practice implications.Providers face several challenges in the consenting process for the use of DHM in the NICU setting. These include limited time to support parents and educate them appropriately during the decision-making process. Standardized and consistent use of informed consent is essential to address the ethical concerns surrounding the use of DHM in the NICU setting.",

(1) Power in knowledge and control: parents want autonomy when learning information that may influence medical decision-making. (2) Content and framing of information: they desire information from a trusted resource that helps promote prenatal health and provides neonatal intensive care information. (3) Displaying content: parents want personalization, push notifications, photographs displaying fetal development, and easy-to-understand statistics. (4) Providing information without causing harm: they desire non-value-laden information, and they do not support \"gamifying\" the app to enhance utilization. (5) Decision making: parents want information that would benefit their decision making without assuming that parents have a certain outlook on life or particular values.These findings support the need for the P3 App to aid in decision making when parents experience preterm birth.The findings highlight the need to study the effects of smartphone-based prematurity education on medical decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Background: Bioprotective properties of mother's own milk (MOM) support the use of targeted MOM administration methods, including oropharyngeal therapy (OPT) with MOM, which may mimic the protective effects of swallowed amniotic fluid, thereby improving infant health outcomes. Purpose: To increase the use of MOM-OPT in premature infants in the first week of life. Methods: Quality improvement methods were used to implement precision dosing of OPT. Results: After changing processes and replacing the colostrum immune therapy practice with longer-term precision OPT, the percentage of ordered doses administered to infants in the first week of life increased from 24% to 64%. There was also a 15% increase in very low birth-weight infants who received MOM (from 50% to 65%) at discharge. There were no reported adverse events related to OPT administration. Implications for Practice: Replacing the unit's short-term colostrum immune therapy protocol with the longer-term precision OPT increased the number of doses given in the first week of life and increased the number of very low birth-weight infants discharged receiving MOM. Implications for Research: Researchers should consider studying the reported positive effects of OPT related to infant response (positive oral stimulation, reduction in oral aversion, and improved oral feeding skills), parent participation in care, and maternal milk expression behaviors (longer milk expression duration).",

    "abstract": "Background: Peripheral intravenous catheters connected to an infusion pump are necessary for the delivery of fluids, nutrition, and medications to hospitalized neonates but are not without complications. These adverse events contribute to hospital-acquired patient harm. An artificial intelligence theory called fuzzy logic may allow the use of appropriate variables to predict infusion failure. Purpose: This innovative study aimed to develop an intravenous infusion nanotechnology monitoring system that would alert the nurse to impending peripheral intravenous infusion failure. Methods: An intravenous infusion nanotechnology monitoring system, using predictor variables of pressure, pH, and oxygen saturation used in a fuzzy logic alarm algorithm was developed to alert the nurse to impending peripheral intravenous infusion failure. Findings: The developed intravenous infusion nanotechnology monitoring system is composed of a peripheral intravenous catheter with nanotechnology multimodal sensor, an intravenous pump, a fuzzy logic algorithm, and alarm. For example, using this system, an elevated in-line pressure, a low pH, and a low venous oxygen level would generate an alarm for possible impending infusion failure. Implications for Practice: With further development, this technology may help nurses predict and prevent adverse outcomes from intravenous infusions. This work shows how nurses can be content experts and innovators of technology that they use to make clinical decisions. Implications for Research: After regulatory approval, a randomized controlled trial may be performed to investigate whether interventions at the time of an alarm would result in fewer adverse outcomes and improve safety.",

The use of ultrasound to confirm UVC position remains infrequent in the NICU. Purpose: To determine the feasibility of training an NNP in the acquisition and interpretation of a parasternal short-axis (PSAX) image of the heart to confirm UVC position. Methods: A retrospective review of 48 charts evaluated descriptive data using standard technique of an x-ray to confirm UVC placement. An NNP was trained to acquire and interpret a parasternal short-axis (PSAX) cardiac view by a pediatric cardiologist. The NNP independently and prospectively evaluated 21 neonates and determined whether the UVC was in satisfactory or unsatisfactory position. The same image was blindly over-read by the pediatric cardiologist. Agreement between the NNP and pediatric cardiologist interpretations as well as the pediatric cardiologist and radiologist interpretations was evaluated using the κ-test. Results: Initial pediatric cardiology interpretation of UVC position showed the UVC to be malpositioned in 66% of neonates (n = 14). NNP and pediatric cardiology interpretations in UVC position had 86% agreement (κ-0.667). Pediatric cardiology (ultrasound) and radiology interpretations (x-ray) in UVC position had 86% agreement (κ-0.69). Implications for Practice: It is feasible to train NNPs to perform and accurately interpret a single PSAX ultrasound image to determine satisfactory UVC position. Implications for Research: Increasing the use of ultrasound to determine satisfactory position of UVCs in the NICU can reduce unnecessary exposure to ionizing radiation in neonates.",

Yet palliative care practices appear to be inconsistent and sporadically used for infants. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to describe the use of an established pediatric palliative care team for seriously ill infants in a metropolitan hospital. Methods: This was a retrospective medical record review. Findings: The population included 64 infants who were admitted to a level IV neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and then died during hospitalization between January 2015 and December 2016. Most infants died in an ICU (n = 63, 95%), and only 20 infants (31%) received palliative care consultation. Most common reasons for consultation were care coordination, defining goals of care and end-of-life planning, and symptom management. Implications for Practice: Palliative care consultation at this institution did not change the course of end-of-life care. Interventions provided by the ICU team to infants surrounding end of life were similar to those in infants receiving palliative care services from the specialists. Our findings may be useful for developing guidelines regarding how to best utilize palliative care services for infants with life-threatening conditions who are admitted to an ICU. Implications for Research: These finding support continued research in neonatal palliative care, more specifically the impact of palliative care guidelines and algorithms.",

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore nurses' knowledge, attitude, and use of maternal voice as a therapeutic intervention for preterm infants in the NICU. Methods: Neonatal nurses (n = 117) completed an online survey about the use of maternal voice in their individual units. Questions included: (1) previous knowledge surrounding use of maternal voice in the NICU; (2) their attitudes about using maternal voice recordings and/or live maternal speech as an intervention; (3) whether their unit had the necessary equipment and environment conducive to using the therapy; (4) average amount of time parents were in the NICU with their neonate; and (5) in what situations they would personally encourage the use of maternal recordings (during procedures, rounds, etc). Results: Of those responding, 73.3% of nurse (n = 117) respondents agreed they were willing to incorporate maternal recordings into caregiving, with 80.8% indicating they were open to learning and employing different therapies to improve parental involvement in infant care. Implications for Practice: When the appropriate equipment is available, neonatal nurses are interested and willing to use alternative therapies that incorporate parental participation into direct caregiving as well as utilizing maternal voice recordings. Implications for Research: Further research with larger, more diverse samples is needed to determine the current knowledge, attitudes, and practices of maternal voice recordings by NICU nurses. Future research can also focus on barriers to utilization of the therapy during daily care.",

Up to 70% of preterm infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit experience challenges while initiating oral feeding. Oral feeding skills require intact neurobehavioral development. Evolving evidence demonstrates that cumulative stress exposure results in epigenetic modification of glucocorticoid-related genes. Epigenetics is a field of study that focuses on phenotypic changes that do not involve alterations in the DNA sequence. Epigenetic modification of glucocorticoid-related genes alters cortisol reactivity to environmental stimuli, which may influence neurobehavioral development, and is the essence of the evolving field of Preterm Behavioral Epigenetics. It is plausible that early-life cumulative stress exposure and the ensuing epigenetic modification of glucocorticoid-related genes impair neurobehavioral development required for achievement of oral feeding skills in preterm infants.",

Purpose: To evaluate physiological stability during SSC and incubator care in a group of preterm infants born at a gestational age (GA) of 32 weeks or less and receiving respiratory support. Methods: Descriptive, observational study including 10 preterm infants (GA 22-32 weeks, postnatal age 2-48 days) were evaluated during SSC compared with flanking time periods in the incubator. Cerebral and systemic regional oxygen saturation (rSa o 2 ), pulse oximetry (Sp o 2 ), heart rate (HR), and body temperature were recorded, and the fractional tissue oxygen extraction (fTOE) was calculated. Results: A total of 16 periods of SSC (mean duration 3 hours 30 minutes) were evaluated, 9 during nasal continuous positive airway pressure and 7 during mechanical ventilation. Cerebral rSa o 2 was 68% ± 4% (SE) and 69% ± 4% during incubator care and SSC, respectively ( P = .56). Somatic rSao 2 was 64% ± 4% during incubator care and 66% ± 4% during SSC ( P = .54). Also, fTOE, HR, and Sp o 2 was similar during the 2 modes of care. Body temperature increased during SSC ( P &lt; .01). Implications for Practice: The present study reveals no differences in cerebral and somatic tissue oxygenation between periods of SSC and care in the incubator. The findings indicate that SSC supports physiological stability also during management of very preterm infants receiving respiratory support. Implications for Research: Further studies directed to further optimize SSC performance should enable its safe implementation at gradually lower gestational and postnatal ages.",

    "abstract": "Background: To effectively practice true family-centered care (FCC) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) setting, a nurse needs to understand the perceptions and concerns of all fathers. Although research is emerging on fathers' perceptions and experiences, the samples of fathers represented are not from diverse socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic populations, which limit the findings' generalizability. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the needs of NICU fathers and whether these needs differed based on sociodemographic factors. Methods: A quantitative, comparative, descriptive design was used to determine the needs of NICU fathers. Additional analysis was conducted to determine whether the needs differed based on education, income, and gestational age, whether the father preferred speaking English or Spanish, and whether these sociodemographic factors could predict needs. To determine sociodemographic factors and needs, a demographic questionnaire and the NICU Family Needs Inventory were administered to 99 fathers in 6 level III NICUs. Results: Data were analyzed using independent sample t test, 1-way analysis of variance, and multiple linear regression. The results showed that fathers reported a broad span of needs and fathers from disadvantaged populations may have greater needs in certain areas. Implications for Practice: These results emphasize the importance of the nurses' role in assessing the needs of NICU fathers. By understanding fathers' needs, nurses can provide individualized FCC to fathers to help them be more involved in the care and support of their infant. Implications for Research: Further research is needed to support these findings and test interventions that promote communication between providers and fathers.",

Evidence suggests human milk (HM) has pain-relieving qualities; however, nurses may not be aware of this evidence.This article presents the evidence for HM and breastfeeding for pain management, as well as describes using the evidence to create an interprofessional enterprise-wide policy on the topic.Cochrane, PubMed, CINAHL, and Medline were searched for full-length articles published in peer-reviewed journals between 2012 and 2020. Articles using HM as an independent variable during a painful procedure, or discussing benefits of HM for pain management, were analyzed.Ten articles were selected for evaluating use of HM for pain relief in term and preterm infants. There is statistically significant evidence that expressed HM has pain-relieving abilities, especially when combined with other soothing interventions such as rocking. HM reduces crying time, and lowers pain scores during painful procedures. Seven articles recommend breastfeeding for effective pain management. Breastfeeding reduces crying time, heart rate, and pain scores compared with oral sucrose, holding, nonnutritive sucking, swaddling, and topical anesthetics.Breastfeeding and HM should be offered as primary pain management options. Having an interprofessional enterprise-wide policy for the use of breastfeeding and HM for pain management during painful procedures, such as vaccination, will provide safe, effective pain management.Further understanding of effective HM dosing for pain management and use of pasteurized donor HM in place of expressed HM is required.",

    "abstract": "Background: The US opioid epidemic has resulted in an increase of infants at risk for developing neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Traditionally, treatment has consisted of pharmacological interventions to reduce symptoms of withdrawal. However, nonpharmacological interventions (eg, skin-to-skin contact, holding) can also be effective in managing the distress associated with NAS. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine whether infant carrying or “babywearing” (ie, holding an infant on one's body using cloth) can reduce distress associated with NAS among infants and caregivers. Methods: Heart rate was measured in infants and adults (parents vs other adults) in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) pre- (no touching), mid- (20 minutes into being worn in a carrier), and post-babywearing (5 minutes later). Results: Using a 3-level hierarchical linear model at 3 time points (pre, mid, and post), we found that babywearing decreased infant and caregiver heart rates. Across a 30-minute period, heart rates of infants worn by parents decreased by 15 beats per minute (bpm) compared with 5.5 bpm for infants worn by an unfamiliar adult, and those of adults decreased by 7 bpm (parents) and nearly 3 bpm (unfamiliar adult). Implications for Practice: Results from this study suggest that babywearing is a noninvasive and accessible intervention that can provide comfort for infants diagnosed with NAS. Babywearing can be inexpensive, support parenting, and be done by nonparent caregivers (eg, nurses, volunteers). Implications for Research: Close physical contact, by way of babywearing, may improve outcomes in infants with NAS in NICUs and possibly reduce the need for pharmacological treatment.

Clinicians working within the surgical NICU must be able to access emergency equipment and medications quickly in order to respond to critical situations. A crash cart that integrates human factors principles and supports both the NRP and PALS algorithms is necessary to promote patient safety for this high-risk population.A multidisciplinary quality improvement project constructed an optimal crash cart configuration that embedded human factors principles and supported clinical workflow by reflecting both the NRP and the PALS algorithms in an NICU that cares for cardiac and surgical patients.A crash cart working group including frontline NICU staff, simulation experts, and a human factors specialist was formed within a surgical NICU. Human factors principles were utilized to align the organization of the cart with the NRP and PALS algorithms to increase the efficiency and intuitiveness of the cart. The new crash cart configuration was usability tested through simulation, revised on the basis of clinical feedback, and then implemented in a clinical setting. Data were collected following implementation of the new crash cart to validate that the new configuration was viewed as a significant improvement. The Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle was used to make improvements and capture outcome indicators.Evaluation data collected both during usability simulation testing and in situ within the NICU clinical environment indicated that the revised crash cart scored higher on Likert scale response questions than the previous crash cart.Human factors science, in combination with frontline user engagement, should be utilized to create intuitive crash cart configurations, which are then tested in a simulation environment and evaluated in situ in the NICU.Further research around crash cart design within NICUs that use multiple lifesaving algorithms would add to the paucity of research around the impact of human factors theory in the utilization of lifesaving equipment and medications within this specific population.",

Preterm infants may not exhibit the same withdrawal symptoms as term infants diagnosed with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). There are no current standards for how to screen, assess, or treat NAS in preterm infants.This study explored the current state of practice for preterm infants born at less than 34 weeks of gestational age exposed to intrauterine opioids.This was a descriptive cross-sectional study of NAS practice in preterm infants born at less than 34 weeks of gestational age in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in the United States and Canada. The study was conducted May through September 2018. All respondents cared for preterm infants born at less than 34 weeks of gestational age exposed to intrauterine drugs.There were 70 respondents representing 67 hospitals in the United States and 1 in Canada. Level III NICUs represented 69% of respondents. Ninety-three percent reported neonatal triggers for further evaluation. Review of maternal history and maternal urine testing was the most consistent practice across NICUs. A modified Finnegan scoring tool was used for both preterm and term infants. Morphine was reported as the most common first-line drug used for treatment.Great variability in NAS practice for preterm infants born at less than 34 weeks of gestational age across the multiple NICUs supports the need for a validated preterm infant assessment tool and development of appropriate treatment strategies.Future research describing the NAS symptomatology of preterm infants born at less than 34 weeks of gestational age exposed to intrauterine opioids is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Background: Filamin A (FLNA) is an intracellular actin-binding protein, encoded by the FLNA gene, with a wide tissue expression. It is involved in several cellular functions, and extracellular matrix structuring. FLNA gene alterations lead to diseases with a wide phenotypic spectrum, such as brain periventricular nodular heterotopia (PVNH), cardiovascular abnormalities, skeletal dysplasia, and lung involvement. Clinical Findings: We present the case of a female infant who showed at birth aortic valve stenosis and PVNH, and subsequently developed interstitial lung disease with severe pulmonary hypertension. Primary Diagnosis: The association of aortic valve dysplasia, left ventricular outflow obstruction, persistent patent ductus arteriosus, and brain heterotopic gray matter suggested a possible FLNA gene alteration. A novel heterozygous intronic variant in the FLNA gene (NM_001110556.1), c.4304-1G &gt;A, was detected. Interventions: In consideration of valve morphology and severity of stenosis, the neonate was scheduled for a transcatheter aortic valvuloplasty. At 3 months of life, she developed hypoxemic respiratory failure with evidence of severe pulmonary hypertension. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) and milrinone on continuous infusion were started. Because of a partial response to iNO, an intravenous continuous infusion of sildenafil was introduced. Outcomes: In consideration of severe clinical course and fatal outcome, the new FLNA gene mutation described in our patient seems to be associated with a loss of function of FLNA. Practice Recommendations: Lung and brain involvement, in association with left ventricular outflow obstruction and persistent patency of ductus arteriosus, should be considered highly suggestive of FLNA gene alterations, in a female newborn.",

    "abstract": "Background: Continuity of care (COC) is highly regarded; however, data about benefits are mixed. Little is known about components, parental views, or the value COC may provide to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) infants and families. Purpose: To describe parents' perspectives on definitions, reasons they value, and suggested improvements regarding COC provided by neonatologists. Methods: We performed a qualitative study of in-person, semistructured interviews with parents of NICU infants hospitalized for 28 days or more. We analyzed interview transcripts using content analysis, identifying codes of parental experiences, expressed value, and improvement ideas related to neonatologist COC, and categorizing emerging themes. Results: Fifteen families (15 mothers and 2 fathers) described 4 themes about COC: (1) longitudinal neonatologists: gaining experience with infants and building relationships with parents over time; (2) background knowledge: knowing infants' clinical history and current condition; (3) care plans: establishing patient-centered goals and management plans; and (4) communication: demonstrating consistent communication and messaging. Parents described benefits of COC as decreasing knowledge gaps, advancing clinical progress, and decreasing parental stress. Suggested improvement strategies included optimizing staffing and sign-out/transition processes, utilizing clinical guidelines, and enhancing communication. Using parent input and existing literature, we developed a definition and conceptual framework of COC. Implications for Practice: NICUs should promote practices that enhance COC. Parental suggestions can help direct improvement efforts. Implications for Research: Our COC definition and conceptual framework can guide development of research and quality improvement projects. Future studies should investigate nursing perspectives on NICU COC and the impact of COC on infant and family outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Currently, reference ranges for renal oxygenation measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in preterm infants beyond the first days of life are lacking, especially those born prior to 29 weeks' gestation. Population estimates of renal oxygenation (rSO 2 ) levels among preterm infants over time have yet to be established, leading to reluctance in clinical application.To characterize the distribution and estimate population parameters for renal oxygenation measured by NIRS during the first 14 days of life among preterm infants.We prospectively observed rSO 2 trends of 37 infants before 34 weeks' gestation and 1800-g or less birth weight for the first 14 days of life. Analyses included distribution fit tests, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, and t tests.Average daily rSO 2 variation steadily increased with 42% difference through the first 14 days of life. For all infants, renal rSO 2 means peaked during the first 3 days of life and plateaued around 7 days. Daily rSO 2 slopes were significantly lower among males and infants 29 weeks' or less gestation.Renal rSO 2 during the first 14 days of life reflects normal extrauterine transition reaching stabilization around 7 days of life. Gestational age, birth weight, and gender may predict the early trajectory of rSO 2 patterns. Population estimates provide parameters for renal rSO 2 that may indicate early-onset tissue hypoxia when acute or significant drops from baseline occur.We present a framework to guide future research using renal NIRS technology in preterm infants to determine deviations from expected trends that may precede renal injury.",

    "abstract": "Background: This case describes a case of vertical transmission of COVID-19 from a mother to her neonate. The neonate subsequently developed acute respiratory failure consistent with adult symptoms of COVID-19. Clinical Findings: This preterm neonate was born at 33 4/7 weeks' gestational age to a COVID-19–positive mother and admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for prematurity and respiratory distress. The neonate developed acute respiratory failure with severe persistent pulmonary hypertension of newborn (PPHN) and required intubation and maximum respiratory and cardiovascular support. The neonate subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 at 24 hours of life. Primary Diagnosis: Acute respiratory failure related to COVID-19 infection. Interventions: The neonate was admitted to the NICU on CPAP. At 11 hours of life, the neonate began to exhibit signs of worsening respiratory distress requiring intubation, mechanical, and high frequency ventilation. An echocardiogram revealed severe PPHN. The neonate required dopamine to manage hypotension and was treated with steroids to decrease inflammation associated with airway edema noted during intubation. Pharmaceutically induced paralysis, analgesia, and sedation was used to manage persistent hypoxia. Outcomes: The neonate fully recovered from acute respiratory failure and was discharged home with the mother. Practice Recommendations: Newborns born to mothers who are positive for COVID-19 are at risk for vertical transmission of COVID-19 and should be monitored closely for acute respiratory failure. Respiratory medical management should include supportive care. Staff should also encourage parents to consider receiving the COVID-19 vaccine to protect their newborn from the possibility of developing acute respiratory failure.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this secondary analysis of results from a national survey of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) practices in neonates was to determine whether demographics and types of training were associated with differing radiographic confirmation practices of these catheters. Correlational analyses were performed on the 2010 national database of neonatal PICC practices. The sample consisted of 187 respondents, representing 25% of the level III neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) of more than 20 beds in the United States. The key factors examined were geographic location, size of NICU, academic affiliation, and type of training related to radiographic confirmation of the catheter tip position, routine monitoring and reconfirmation of the catheter tip position following adjustments, and associated patient positioning practices for consistent evaluation of the catheter tip position. Formal training and annual retraining were statistically significantly associated with consistent patient positioning practices for more accurate monitoring of the catheter tip position and acceptable tip location. Size of NICU and academic affiliation were not associated with differences in practices. Adherence to specific national guidelines and recommendations for care of infants with PICCs is significantly impacted by formal training and annual retraining. This underscores the importance of education and annual retraining in preventing PICC-related complications beyond the crucial prevention of central line–associated bloodstream infections.",

Social risk factors found to contribute to poorer school outcomes were family structure, family stability, parental education, poverty, male sex, nonwhite race, and acculturation level. Conclusions: Long-term school outcomes of LBW children are influenced by a number of factors related to the characteristics of both children and their families. These factors need to be considered when designing preventive interventions.",

Since many Americans are using technologies such as the Intranet and smartphones to find health information and manage health, a Web site was developed for mothers who provide breast milk for their preterm hospitalized infants. Purpose: This study examined the efficacy of a Web site for mothers to educate them about breast milk expression and assist them in monitoring their breast milk supply. Methods: Quantitative and qualitative data were collected from mothers whose preterm infants were hospitalized in a level IV neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or transitional care unit (TCU) in an urban academic medical center in the Midwest. Results: Eighteen mothers participated in evaluation of the Web site. Thirteen mothers consistently logged on to the password-protected Web site (mean [standard deviation] = 13.3 [11.7]) times. Most participants, (69.2%), reported they used the breast milk educational information. Most mothers indicated that using the Web site log helped in tracking their pumping. These findings can be used to direct the design and development of web-based resources for mothers of preterm infants Implications for Practice: NICU and TCU staffs need to examine and establish approaches to actively involve mothers in monitoring the establishment and maintenance of an adequate supply of breast milk to improve neonatal health outcomes. Implications for Research: An electronic health application that incorporates the features identified in this study should be developed and tested.",

Outcome measures consisted of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), mortality, growth at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age and discharge, as well as volume and type of milk consumption during hospitalization.NEC rate decreased from 16.67% in the control group to 6.78% in the standardized nutrition bundle group (P = .07). Similarly, there was significant reduction in mortality with the bundled intervention (15.6% in the control group vs 1.6% in the nutrition bundle group; P = .006). Time to first (15 vs 27.5 hours of life; P < .001) and full-volume enteral feeding (8.5 vs 10 days; P = .086) were reduced in the standardized nutrition bundle group compared with the control group. The human milk volume almost doubled with the intervention.Our standardized nutrition bundle protocol inclusive of DHM resulted in lower NEC rates and reduced mortality. The implementation of the DHM program proved to be cost-effective and saved lives. Our findings may help guide development of a structured approach to nutrition protocols inclusive of DHM that can be adapted by other units located in safety-net hospitals.Future research on ethnic and racial barriers to access and affordability of DHM is warranted and much needed.",

Providing parents with the knowledge and skills to care for their infant during this stressful time requires the concerted effort of a multidisciplinary team who can provide clear, concise, and consistent communication. This article provides a step-by-step guide to the information needs of families who are preparing to take their infants home after cardiac surgery. Parents must understand the underlying cardiac defect and the goals and objectives of the surgical repair. In addition to normal newborn care, parents need to learn about care of the incision, nutritional support, and how to safely administer prescribed medications. Potential complications and when to call their health care provider or seek emergency care are an important focus of teaching. Information about infant development, challenges specific to their infant, and pragmatic strategies to support normal development are of prime interest to parents. Written reference materials, a Web resource list, and a family discharge teaching tool provide tangible resources for the family after discharge.",

    "abstract": "The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends injected, inactivated influenza vaccine for all close contacts of high-risk infants. This population includes parents of infants younger than 59 months of age, with an emphasis on children 0–6 months who are not direct candidates for immunization. This 0–6 month age group is a major component of the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) population. No data exist on the compliance rate with influenza vaccine in this specific parent population. The purpose of this study was to assess the compliance rate among this parent population and compare it with vaccine use in the general adult population at the time, which has traditionally ranged from 25% to 32%. The study also sought reasons for poor compliance with flu vaccine. Answering this question is important in determining whether programs directly aimed at NICU parents are required to achieve compliance or if simply informing parents of the need to be immunized results in sufficient vaccination rates. For 14 weeks during the 2004–2005 influenza season, 92 randomly selected parents (from 56 inborn infants) underwent an informational program regarding influenza vaccine and the risks and benefits of vaccination. Parents were surveyed in the spring to assess if they obtained the injection the previous winter. Subjects were parents of NICU patients admitted to the New York University NICU during the 14-week study period. The main outcome measure was the influenza vaccination rate of the parental cohort that underwent the informational program. For those who intended to receive influenza vaccination but did not, reasons for noncompliance were assessed via standardized telephone interview. After the information session, 85 parents (92%) indicated they intended to obtain the vaccine; however 30 parents (32.6%) actually received it by the following spring. The most commonly cited reason for failing to obtain influenza vaccine was convenience. No correlation between parents who obtained the vaccine and infant birth weight, gestational age, or length of stay was observed. Compliance with national recommendations to obtain trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine in this highly specified parent population is roughly equivalent to the national average of all adults in the general population. Caregivers of high-risk neonates must encourage/offer immunization to this targeted population.",

A smooth transition from paper charting to an electronic documentation system is challenging. Using quality improvement tools and building on the clinical microsystems concept can assist with a smooth transition. Specific strategies include involving all stakeholders in the development and implementation of the plan, assessing the culture of the department, and identifying processes and patterns that require attention. Specific steps include developing a statement of aim, formulating a specific path to reach the aim, evaluating the progress of implementation, and creating a template for future process improvement.

Exclusion criteria were death of a twin, congenital anomalies, or extracorporeal life support.Demographics, respiratory needs, feeding characteristics, complications, and discharge needs.A total of 384 discordant twin pairs met inclusion criteria. The larger twins required more ventilation/continuous positive airway pressure (55% vs 44%, P < .01) and/or oxygen therapy (50% vs 41%, P = .02) compared with smaller twins. Smaller twins reached full oral (PO) feeds an average of 0.6 weeks later than larger twins (P < .0001) but had more weight gain per day. Smaller twins transitioned to an open crib at lower weights but at slightly greater age. No differences were noted with necrotizing enterocolitis or apnea. Smaller twins had increased nosocomial infections. Mean length of stay was shorter (P = .0036) in the larger twin group. Only 33% of the twin pairs were discharged on the same day.Larger twins had more acute respiratory issues but achieved certain milestones more rapidly with fewer complications, thus leading to earlier discharge compared with their smaller twin counterparts.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To explore the application of a novel relaxation method (the M Technique) in hospitalized very preterm infants in a level IIIC neonatal intensive care unit. DESIGN: A feasibility, observational intervention study. SUBJECTS: Ten very preterm infants were enrolled to receive the treatment intervention. Eligible infants born less than 30 weeks' gestation received the intervention at 30 weeks' postmenstrual age. METHODS: Based on infant readiness, each infant received the M Technique for 5 minutes. Physiologic parameters (heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturations), behavioral variables (stress and relaxation cues), and infant behavioral state were measured 5 minutes before, during, and up to 10 minutes after the intervention, continuously. RESULTS: Descriptive analysis revealed that baseline physiologic, behavioral state, and behavioral cue parameters changed during and after the application of the M Technique. A decrease in heart rate and respiratory rate occurred during the M Technique (P = .006, P > .001 respectively) and a decrease in heart rate occurred at the end of the M Technique session (P = .02). In addition, an increase in SaO2 occurred during and at 5 minutes following the M Technique session (P = .04, P = .02, respectively). State scores decreased from baseline (mean = 5.1; range, 3–9) to after the intervention (mean = 2.0, range 1–4). As the intervention was delivered, more positive than negative behavioral cues were observed throughout, at the end, and after the M Technique session. CONCLUSION: In this feasibility study, the M Technique can be delivered without adverse effects to very preterm infants who are 30 weeks' postmenstrual age. Additional research is needed with a larger, randomized design to determine short- and long-term effects specifically related to neurologic outcomes.",

In an effort to address these gaps in education and care, the director of the lactation program at a large urban children's hospital developed and instituted the annual regional Human Milk Assembly (HMA), a half-day collaborative meeting of the hospital's regional and referral hospitals' neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) nursing staff, to address lactation-based educational and training needs of all participating institutions. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine whether and how participating HMA hospitals implemented the best practices surrounding human milk and breastfeeding shared by the host institution during a 10-year span of the HMA. Methods: A prospective descriptive study was designed using an electronic web-based survey (SurveyMonkey.com) to elicit participant data. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics whereas qualitative data were analyzed for themes via content analysis. Results: Thirty-one of the 50 hospitals surveyed responded to the electronic survey for a total of 34 individual participants. Seventeen of the 22 (77%) of best practices were implemented at rates of over 50%. Implications for Practice: By enabling a culture of transparency and sharing, hospital staff can be encouraged to implement best practices across a network of regional care centers. Implications for Research: This annual regional HMA could be a model for other areas and research should be conducted to evaluate such programs nationwide.",

    "abstract": "Effective basic newborn resuscitation is an important strategy to reduce the incidence of birth asphyxia and associated newborn outcomes. Outcomes for newborns can be markedly improved if health providers have appropriate newborn resuscitation skills.To evaluate the skills of midwives in newborn resuscitation in delivery rooms in Jordan.Data were collected from observation of 118 midwives from National Health Service hospitals in the north of Jordan who performed basic newborn resuscitation for full-term neonates. A structured checklist of 14 items of basic skills of resuscitation was used. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data.The results highlighted the lack of appropriate performance of the 8 necessary skills at birth by midwives. About 17.8% of midwives had performed the core competencies at birth (ie, assessing breathing pattern/crying, cleaning airways) appropriately and met the standard sequence. Less than half of midwives assessed skin color (40.7%) and breathing pattern or crying (41.5%) appropriately with or without minor deviations from standard sequences. Of the 6 skills that had to be performed by midwives at 30 seconds up to 5 minutes after birth, 4 skills were not performed by about one-quarter of midwives.The midwives' practices at the 2 hospitals of this study were not supported by best practice international guidelines. The study showed that a high proportion of midwives had imperfect basic newborn resuscitation skills despite a mean experience of 8 years. This highlights the critical need for continuing medical education in the area of basic newborn resuscitation. The results highlight the need for formal assessment of midwives' competence in basic newborn resuscitation. National evidence-based policies and quality assurance are needed to reflect contemporary practice.",

Currently, no evidence-based guidelines for safe suctioning in neonates while on bubble nasal CPAP have been published.(1) To characterize the clinical and behavioral responses of neonates on bubble nasal CPAP in a level III neonatal intensive care unit following routine oral and nasopharyngeal suctioning.This pilot study has a 1-sample within-subject repeated-measures design in which neonates (N = 16) served as their own control. Data on a neonate's physiological and behavior measures (heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation [SaO2], and Premature Infant Pain Profile [PIPP] score) were collected before, during, and after the completion of suctioning sequence.A total of 16 neonates with a mean gestational age of 29.76 weeks and an average day of life of 3.4 were enrolled. The infant's heart rates did not differ significantly (P = .51) across the suctioning sequence. There were no statistical significant changes in the average respiratory rate across the suctioning sequences (P = .79). SaO2 demonstrated a drop between baseline and after each suctioning (P < .001). The PIPP score demonstrated a precipitous increase throughout the procedure (P < .001). On average, it took 9.5 seconds (SD = 4.9) to complete the suctioning sequences.Our results suggest that the guideline tested is safe and tolerated by infants.This guideline should be tested in a larger sample and with neonates on other nasal CPAP systems.",

Procedural simulation provides opportunity to practice high-risk, low-frequency procedures and helps improve skill retention. A formal procedural simulation experience was created in an attempt to provide sufficient experience for NNPs. While preparing for the simulation experience, the group recognized the lack of validated competency metrics for most neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) procedures.The purpose of this study was to create and validate procedural checklists measuring competence of NNPs participating in simulated performance of 9 high-risk NICU procedures.IRB approval was obtained and NNPs agreed to data collection. A self and peer assessment tool was developed and distributed to NNPs, nurses, and neonatologists to gather a baseline perception of procedural competency. Procedural checklists were then developed to measure/assess individual skills against a standard. Benchmark videos were created to demonstrate the standard approach to procedural performance. Each procedural skill performed by the NNP participant was scored by 3 individual evaluators: once in real time and twice by video recording analysis.A Cronbach α was used to measure the reliability and validity of the procedural checklists. Comparison was made between live grading and video-based grading scores using analysis of variance. Difference between grading modalities was less than 3% and nonsignificant for 8 of 9 procedures. No significant difference was found between individual graders for any of the skills being evaluated and suggested high interrater reliability of the checklists.Objective, standardized procedural checklists are valid tools to evaluate NNP procedural skills in simulation. Procedural simulation experiences help strengthen skills, improve performance, and possibly improve patient outcomes.",

Nearly 27% have limited or are without ancillary support while 29.8% cannot meet some standards of care due to inadequate resources. Almost 22% lack written protocols and procedural opportunities are limited or a concern for 15.8% of the NNPs.A better understanding of the responsibilities of the level I to III NNP will assist with developing staffing guidelines, influence practice models, and guide recruitment and retention of the NNP.A systematic literature review yielded articles on the value of nurse practitioners and their ability to deliver safe, effective and cost-conscience care but not on what the role entails on a daily basis. Further studies are needed to specifically compare the role of the level IV NNP to the level I, II, and III NNP to further delineate NNP functionality according to level of care.",

The number of neonates born addicted to opioids has grown exponentially over the last several decades, leading to increased neonatal intensive care unit admissions and rising healthcare costs. Recent studies have yielded mixed results regarding which medication is most effective at relieving the symptoms of opioid withdrawal and reducing the weaning timeframe for babies with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS).To explore and compare the effectiveness of morphine versus methadone in the treatment for NAS using a standardized protocol.A literature search of PubMed and CINAHL was performed. The search yielded 10 quantitative studies that were analyzed for potential practice changes.Based on current literature, following a standardized, stringent weaning protocol is more beneficial than the pharmacologic agent used. Studies reveal shorter weaning times and hospital stays in almost every group that followed rigid guidelines.Although current studies are promising for the desired outcome, more research is needed to develop appropriate protocol-based weaning regimens for management of NAS.As the occurrence of NAS continues to rise, its management must vigorously meet the challenges of the diagnosis. Institutions should reevaluate their current protocols based on reassuring data showing that stringent guidelines using morphine or methadone can improve clinical outcomes, reduce hospital length, and lower healthcare costs.",

Methods/Search Strategy: PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science searches were performed using relevant key words to identify references addressing maternal overweight or obesity, prematurity, human milk, and lactation. Findings/Results: In the United States, more than half of women enter pregnancy with an overweight or obese body mass index. These women have increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and obstetric complications that can undermine successful initiation and continuation of lactation, including preterm birth. Maternal overweight and obesity are also associated with alterations in mother's milk composition. Implications for Practice: Mother-preterm infant dyads affected by maternal overweight and obesity are at risk for barriers to initiation and continuation of lactation. Support for early initiation of milk expression is needed. Continued support, especially during the first weeks of lactation, can facilitate sustained milk production. Implications for Research: Considerable knowledge gaps remain in this area of human milk science. Future research is needed to facilitate more comprehensive understanding of differences in milk composition associated with maternal overweight and obesity and their impact on clinical outcomes in the preterm infant.",

Neonatal nurses have been identified as a major source of support for fathers; yet, nurses have identified obstacles to family-centered care of the father. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to present results that broaden the knowledge of factors that affect time NICU nurses spend with fathers. The information presented here is a portion of results from a larger survey that examined factors affecting NICU nurse caring beliefs of fathers. Methods: This survey study included NICU nurses and was administered anonymously online. Content analysis was completed on responses to open-ended questions. Results: Questions asked nurses about the time they spend with fathers. Nurses described problems with workflow and encouraged family bonding. Some nurses described spending equal amounts of time with both parents, whereas others focused on either the mother or the father. Paternal attributes that affected time nurses spent with fathers included confidence, motivation, level of competence, beliefs, attitudes, and availability. Maternal factors included culture and gatekeeping. Infant factors were level of illness and tolerance to activity. Implications for Practice: Unmotivated fathers may benefit from encouragement from nurses to participate in the care of their infants. Nurses can encourage parental partnerships in caring for their infants. Implications for Research: Factors identified in this study can help guide future studies. Understanding the relationship between NICU fathers and nurses can help improve interactions and communication.",

By understanding how parents perceive patient safety in the NICU, clinicians can identify appropriate parent-centered strategies to involve them in promoting safe care for their infants.To determine how parents of neonates conceptualize patient safety in the NICU.We conducted qualitative interviews with 22 English-speaking parents of neonates from the NICU and observations of various parent interactions within the NICU over several months. Data were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Findings were critically reviewed through peer debriefing.Parents perceived safe care through their observations of clinicians being present, intentional, and respectful when adhering to safety practices, interacting with their infant, and communicating with parents in the NICU. They described partnering with clinicians to promote safe care for their infants and factors impacting that partnership. We cultivated a conceptual model highlighting how parent-clinician partnerships can be a core element to promoting NICU patient safety.Parents' observations of clinician behavior affect their perceptions of safe care for their infants. Assessing what parents observe can be essential to building a partnership of trust between clinicians and parents and promoting safer care in the NICU.Uncertainty remains about how to measure parent perceptions of safe care, the level at which the clinician-parent partnership affects patient safety, and whether parents' presence and involvement with their infants in the NICU improve patient safety.",

The heart rate characteristic (HRC) index score, a measure of heart rate variability, could prove useful in the management of neonates with HIE as new therapies emerge or when withdrawal-of-support decisions are being considered.The main purpose was to describe correlation between HRC index scores and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) severity of injury for neonates with HIE.Low/high HRC index scores retrieved at initiation of TH (baseline), 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours, brain MRI severity of injury, and National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Death/Disability and Death scores were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Independent t tests and linear regression were used to examine relationships for each outcome measure.Twenty-seven neonates were stratified into 2 groups: noninjury (n = 11) and injury (n = 16). Statistically significant relationships were observed. Strikingly, mean low HRC index score for the noninjury group ranged between 0.37 and 0.65 and was between 0.61 and 0.86 for the injury group. Mean high HRC index score for the noninjury group ranged between 0.66 and 1.02 and was between 1.04 and 1.41 for the injury group.HRC index score may be a useful guide in the future management of neonates with HIE.This study established correlations between HRC index and MRI injury scores in neonates treated with TH. Further research is warranted to establish important relationships between brain injury and HRC index scores before this tool can be used clinically for this purpose.",

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine factors associated with the need to initiate medication for the treatment of NOWS. Methods: A retrospective review of medical records was conducted of 204 infants born to mothers who used opioids during pregnancy from April 2011 to September 2017. Associations between maternal, infant, and environmental factors and the need for neonatal pharmacological management were examined using χ 2 , t tests, and regression analysis. Results: Of 204 neonates exposed to opioids prenatally, 121 (59%) developed symptoms of NOWS, requiring treatment with morphine. Neonates requiring morphine had significantly higher gestational ages (37.7 weeks vs 36.4 weeks; P &lt; .001), and mothers were present at the neonate's bedside for a lower proportion of their total hospital stay (57% vs 74% of days; P &lt; .001). Maternal factors associated with the need for neonatal medication treatment included the mother's reason for opioid use ( P = .014), primary type of opioid used ( P &lt; .001), tobacco use ( P = .023), and use of benzodiazepines ( P = .003). Implications for Practice: This research provides information regarding the proportion of infants exposed to opioids prenatally who develop NOWS that requires treatment, as well as maternal, infant, and environmental factors associated with the need for neonatal medication use. Implications for Research: Future research is needed to examine these relationships prospectively in a larger and more diverse sample.",

Diaper dermatitis remains prevalent despite studies documenting an understanding of prevention and treatment modalities. Standardizing perineal skin care guidelines could reduce DD. Purpose: Implement perineal skin care guidelines, while introducing novel diaper wipes, to decrease the incidence of DD by 20% within a 1-year period. Methods: Our unit reviewed evidence-based literature to develop a standardized perineal care guideline for prevention and treatment, encompassing the use of novel, preservative-free diaper wipes with grapefruit seed extract. The outcome measures were the incidence and duration of DD. Process compliances were monitored. The balancing measure was the rate of fungal skin infection while using preservative-free wipes. Findings: Between July 2017 and March 2019, 1070 infants were admitted for 1 or more days, with 11% of those being born at less than 30 weeks of gestational age. After guideline implementation in January 2018, the incidence of DD decreased by 16.7%. The incidence of severe cases dropped by 34.9%, with 3.5 days per 100 patient-days shortened duration. Process compliance was achieved. Neonates tolerated the novel wipes without increased fungal skin infection. Implications for Practice: The Perineal Skin Care Guidelines could reduce the rate and duration of DD. Newborn intensive care unit infants tolerated the novel diaper wipes.

    "abstract": "Background: Neonatal intensive care nurses have historically been responsible for preparing enteral feedings—a costly and time-consuming process that may require leaving the bedside. To address these concerns, the Milk Technician Program was implemented at a major military treatment facility. Milk technicians were specially trained and responsible for handling, storing, and preparing enteral feeds. Purpose: To determine effectiveness of the Milk Technician Program, changes in length of time required to first attain full feeds, cost of feeding preparation, adherence to feeding preparation procedures, and nurse and milk technician role variables were evaluated. Methods: A pre-/postdesign was used to compare length of time to full enteral feedings and cost. A plan-do-study-act design was used to evaluate protocol adherence and to identify and evaluate nurse and milk technician role variables. Data were collected via surveys, direct observations, and retrospective chart reviews to determine the overall effectiveness of this intervention. Results: The average time for extremely and very preterm infants (<28 to 31 weeks) to first reach full feeds decreased from 32 to 19 days, t (33.1) = 2.33, P = .026, d = 0.704. Estimated feeding preparation cost savings for all infants admitted to the unit was $767 per day. Observed milk technician adherence to preparation procedures was 95.5%. Most nurses reported that the program saved time (97%) and all milk technicians reported improved job satisfaction. Nurses expressed concerns about accuracy and safety of preparation. Milk technicians reported concerns with communication, supplies, and lack of perceived support. Implications for Practice: Milk technicians offer significant benefit to infants and nurses in the neonatal intensive care unit, including reducing time for infants to reach full feeds, saving nurses' time, and reducing costs. Implications for Research: Further research is needed to identify ideal educational backgrounds for milk technicians and to directly measure the effect of milk technicians on hospital length of stay and infant growth parameters.",

It is not different for the central nervous system altering class of drugs, benzodiazepines (BZDs). Little information is known about the long-term effects of BZDs use in neonates as anxiolytics and sedatives causing trepidation with their use in the clinical setting. Insufficient data related to the use of BZDs result in a lack of clear recommendations to guide caregivers at the bedside on the safest administration patterns to avoid long-term adverse effects. However, caring for ill neonates, in particular surgical patients and infants requiring prolonged hospitalizations, necessitates the use of these agents. A literature search within the electronic database, PubMed, of English language, full-text articles published between 2007 and 2012 was undertaken to determine the state of the science regarding the use of BZDs in neonates. These medications cause unwanted effects in neonates with immature hepatic function (primary site of metabolism) and during a developmental period of tremendous neuroplasticity. It benefits caregivers to recognize the need for improved monitoring of stress experienced by infants in the NICU and understand the impact of prolonged agitation and subacute pain on infant development.",

    "abstract": "Patients in the neonatal intensive care unit are a vulnerable population with specific nutritional requirements, which include increased protein and caloric needs for adequate growth. Some infants cannot tolerate gastric feeds and need to have postpyloric feeds to grow. Placement of a postpyloric tube can be done by gastric insufflation. Gastric insufflation is a technique where air is inserted into the stomach as a nasogastric tube is advanced through the pylorus to the duodenum. There is research to support this technique in pediatrics, but scant evidence exists for placement of postpyloric tubes in the infant population.The aim of this quality improvement practice project was to determine whether the current practice for postpyloric tube placement by the bedside nurses in the neonatal intensive care unit is safe and effective.Data were prospectively collected on 38 infants requiring placement of 60 postpyloric tubes over an 8-week period.The results indicate a success rate of 95.6% for tube placement when a subset of infants diagnosed with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) (n = 15) was excluded. Six (40%) of the 15 infants with CDH had postpyloric tubes placed successfully. Nursing years of experience did not affect successful postpyloric tube placement.The postpyloric tube placement policy was modified as a result of findings from this project. Placement of a postpyloric tube with one attempt by the bedside nurse was safe and effective in most preterm infants in our care excluding patients with CDH. The new policy reduced infants' exposure to radiation due to a decrease in the number of x-rays in comparison to interventional radiology placement.Further research should be done by units that primarily care for low birth-weight premature infants.",

Close assessment of glucose stability and rapid intervention for hypoglycemia are primary tenets of neonatal care. The definition of neonatal hypoglycemia remains controversial. Practicing clinicians are challenged to sort through multiple conflicting recommendations surrounding the diagnosis and treatment of hypoglycemia. Recently, a state-of-the-science recommendation for hypoglycemia management has been proposed and adopted. This operational threshold for blood glucose levels defines concentrations at which clinical intervention is recommended to prevent the potential untoward effects of hypoglycemia. An understanding of glucose homeostasis, the controversies surrounding the defining of hypoglycemia, the impact of hypoglycemia on the developing brain, and an appreciation for the technical limitations in accurately monitoring glucose are critical to providing state-of-the-art care to neonates.",

This Critically Appraised Topic (CAT) evaluates a meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined sucrose as analgesia for neonatal procedural pain. PURPOSE To determine the efficacy and optimal dosing of sucrose for neonatal procedural pain. METHODS A literature search identified 5 studies that met criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis, for a total of 271 infants studied. The primary outcome measure was crying time, measured for 3 minutes after a painful procedure following administration of water or varying doses of sucrose. RESULTS There was no difference in crying time between the 0.18 g sucrose and water groups (P > 0.05), but crying time was significantly less in the other sucrose groups. Doses of at least 0.24 g (2 mL 12% sucrose) were found to be most effective. No adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSION This CAT systematically appraises this meta-analysis, provides clinical bottom lines, and includes recommendations for practice.

Neither the performance characteristics of these tests with respect to NEC, nor their indirect impact, were evaluated formally before widespread adoption into clinical care. The published evidence suggests that these tests are not useful as diagnostic or screening tools. There is no evidence that routine stool screening for occult blood or reducing substances predicts NEC or decreases the rate or severity of this disease. The direct costs of the tests are significant. A greater concern is their potential unintended consequences, which include the cost of secondary tests, restricted nutritional intake, and the accumulation of distracting, useless data. The logistics of maintaining quality control, the demands on nursing time, and the cost of testing are increasingly important considerations. This installment of Focus on the Physical diverges from a step-by-step systematic physical assessment by addressing the utility of testing neonatal stools for occult blood and reducing substances as aids in the early diagnosis or prevention of NEC. Using the information from these tests requires a framework for understanding their rationale, the test performance characteristics in the NICU setting, and the potential benefits, costs, and risks of their routine use.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS The literature published between 1994 through May 2003 was reviewed via a computer search accessing MEDLINE via OVID. Eight applicable studies were retrieved and analyzed. The study designs were descriptive, retrospective, noncomparative, consecutive case series. RESULTS The postoperative anatomical outcomes varied dramatically between studies with retinal reattachment rates of 0.8% to 90%. Surgeries that achieved a 50% or higher rate of reattachment occurred primarily between 2 and 9 months of age. Surgeries that occurred between 7 and 11 months of age achieved a lower percentage of retinal reattachment. Further, the longer the duration of follow-up, the lower the percentage of retinas that remained attached. Most importantly, at least in these reports, the degree of retinal reattachment did not correlate well with the level of visual function. One report demonstrated no statistical correlation between visual and anatomical success. Poor visual outcomes were noted in both timely and delayed cases of surgical reattachment of the retina. Many of the reports described challenges in accurately measuring low levels of vision.",

METHODS A novel program was designed to provide inpatient RSVP for at-risk infants cared for in 1 tertiary care newborn intensive care unit (NICU). This inpatient program was part of a coordinated approach to RSVP, designed and implemented by 3 hospitals. An RSVP program logic model was created and used by a multidisciplinary team to evaluate the in-house program and identify areas of program activity requiring improvement. RESULTS Following the 2000 to 2001 RSV season, a compliance and outcomes audit was performed in the tertiary center; 193 infants were enrolled in the RSVP program and 162 infants had received RSVP in the NICU [Mean = 1.64 doses]. Telephone follow-up with the parents of discharged infants identified that 159 infants (98%) had successfully completed their full course of RSVP. Using the RSVP program logic model, 5 areas for program improvement were identified including infant recruitment, patient transfer/discharge processes, product procurement, preparation/distribution/administration of doses, and healthcare team communication. CONCLUSIONS Interdisciplinary collaboration is an important factor in the success of the RSVP program and has supported a consistent model of care for the delivery of RSVP. The program logic model provided a useful structure to systematically review the RSVP program in this organization.",

Purpose: This study had 2 purposes: (1) to explore parental attitudes and beliefs about participating in neonatal therapies and (2) to identify barriers and facilitators to parental involvement and suggest ways to optimize neonatal therapy services. Methods: The study design and data analysis were informed by constructivist grounded theory methods. Semistructured telephone interviews were conducted with 9 mothers of children who had received neonatal therapy. Findings: After an early period of fear and powerlessness, a transition point occurred where the survival of their infant became more certain and parents were able to consider the future. At this point, participation in therapies was perceived to be more relevant. Therapy participation was experienced as a means of regaining autonomy and control in a context of trauma, but parents encountered barriers related to accessing therapists and external demands on their time. Implications for Practice: Parental participation is best facilitated by frequent and flexible access to neonatal therapists and staffing levels should reflect this. On commencing therapy, parents should be given therapists' contact details to maximize opportunities for face-to-face encounters. Implications for Research: Future research is needed to explore parental readiness to participate in therapies in the neonatal intensive care unit. Research exploring the impact of parental involvement in therapies over a longer time frame would be beneficial. Finally, there is a need to determine efficacy and effectiveness of parent-delivered neonatal therapies.",

Some evidence exists to support that withholding feedings during transfusion reduces the risk of subsequent NEC development. Purpose: To review the most recent literature on this topic to determine best evidence-based practice regarding withholding or not withholding feedings during RBC transfusions. Methods/Search Strategy: Four databases were searched using keywords and MeSH terms including “necrotizing enterocolitis,” “NEC,” “NPO,” and “transfusion,” with specifications limiting the search to articles published in the last 10 years and limiting the population to neonates. Findings: Four studies did not demonstrate a reduction in transfusion-associated necrotizing enterocolitis (TANEC) with the implementation of feeding protocols during packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions. One study concluded that it could not confirm the benefit of withholding feeds during transfusion to reduce the risk of TANEC. A 2020 randomized controlled trial (RCT) found no difference in splanchnic oxygenation when enteral feeds are withheld, continued, or restricted during a PRBC transfusion. Holding feedings during PRBC transfusions did not result in adverse nutritional outcomes. Implications for Practice: To determine best evidence-based practice surrounding feeding protocols during RBC transfusions in very low-birth-weight and premature infants less than 37 weeks' gestation. Implications for Research: It is recommended that large, multicentered, adequately powered RCTs be conducted in this area. Individual institutions should standardize their practice to improve quality, safety, and patient outcomes.",

Medications, including narcotics, are used to control pain, but nonpharmacologic interventions are also effective in reducing pain during this procedure and are not associated with adverse effects. Purpose: To evaluate the additive effect of facilitated tucking to the use of morphine on infant pain associated at the time of chest tube removal. Methods: This was a prospective, randomized control study. Sixty infants were randomized into 2 equal groups utilizing a coin flip. All infants received 0.05-mg/kg morphine 20 minutes before chest tube removal. The intervention group received facilitated tucking and the control group received standard care. Infant pain was measured using the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale. Pain was assessed at 3 time points by 2 independent evaluators: 5 minutes before, during, and 5 minutes after removal of the chest tube. Mann-Whitney and Fisher's exact (Chi-square) tests were used to compare the intervention and control groups. Results: Pain scores were increased during chest tube removal for both the intervention and the control groups. Compared with the control group, pain scores for infants in the intervention group were less before, during, and after chest tube removal. Implications for Practice: Facilitated tucking combined with morphine administration can be an effective additive intervention for pain control in infants during chest tube removal. Implications for Research: Evaluate the effect of the facilitated tucking on pain induced by chest tube removal in preterm infants. Preterm infants may respond differently to pain.",

    "abstract": "Background: The concept of developmentally supportive care in preterm infants is of considerable significance in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) setting with regard to preventing complications from preterm birth and promoting optimal growth and development. To provide high-quality developmentally supportive care, NICU nurses must possess high levels of knowledge, importance, perception, and competence. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate South Korean NICU nursing staff's level of knowledge concerning developmentally supportive care, as well as the perceived importance, perception, and perceived competence regarding this concept. Methods: This study employed a cross-sectional descriptive design. Between June 1 and 19, 2020, 160 nurses completed a self-report questionnaire pertaining to developmentally supportive care, which covered the aspects of knowledge, perceived importance, perception (including attitudes, perceived behavioral control, subjective norms, and intentions), and perceived competence. Results: The levels of knowledge, attitude, and intention as a subfactor of perception, and perceived competence pertaining to developmentally supportive care were not high. There was no significant difference in the knowledge and perceived competence of skilled nurses compared with novice nurses. However, skilled nurses recognized that they could provide better developmentally supportive care than novice nurses. Perceived competence was positively correlated with perceived importance and perception. Implications for Practice and Research: Systematic educational programs that can enhance developmentally supportive care competence should be provided to NICU staff nurses. These must clarify the importance of developmentally supportive care and improve NICU nurses' knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and intentions.",

Quantitative data included frequency and length of mentoring meetings, activities completed, and ratings of meaningfulness on a Likert-type scale.Six of the 9 (67%) NANNP mentoring activities completed by the 2 cohorts were rated as \"meaningful\" or \"very meaningful\" by participants.Activities from the NANNP mentoring toolkit provide structure to mentoring relationship development. Recognizing the challenge to recruit and retain NNPs, organizations are encouraged to explore creative solutions to develop and support formalized mentoring programs. Further research is warranted to validate use of NANNP toolkit activities in the establishment and evaluation of a formalized mentoring program in various neonatal intensive care unit settings.",

    "abstract": "Background: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the leading cause of death due to gastrointestinal disease in preterm neonates; yet, clinicians lack reliable and noninvasive predictive tools. Purpose: We aimed to test that diminished high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) and elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines would have utility in NEC prediction. Methods: In this multisite prospective study, we enrolled 250 preterm (26-34 weeks' postmenstrual age [PMA]) neonates with physiological stability at 72 hours of life. HRV was measured noninvasively using electrocardiograhic data from standardized cardiorespiratory monitors at postnatal week 1 of life and weekly thereafter until 35 weeks' PMA or discharge; blood was collected for cytokines at postnatal weeks 1 and 3. NEC was diagnosed via Modified Bell's Staging Criteria. Results: HF-HRV was decreased at weeks 1 and 2 in neonates (47% females) who developed feeding intolerance or stage 2+ NEC. In addition, these neonates displayed elevated levels of IL-8 at week 1 and increased levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-8 at week 3 of life. Low HF-HRV was associated with elevated IL-6 or IL-8 levels at weeks 1 and 3 of life. Logistic regression indicated that only HF-HRV was a significant predictor of feeding intolerance or NEC development. Implications for Practice and Research: HRV is a promising noninvasive modality for NEC risk detection. The association of low HF-HRV with elevated proinflammatory cytokines provides evidence for a putative role of the vagal cholinergic pathway in NEC pathogenesis. Future studies should focus on application of these techniques to test clinical therapeutics.

SUBJECTS: A nationally representative sample of 1400 children who were born between 22 and 36 weeks' gestation. DESIGN: Cohort study. METHODS: Secondary data analysis of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey–Birth Cohort (ECLS-B). The ECLS-B was a prospective national longitudinal study of infants born in the United States during the calendar year 2001 drawn from birth certificates in the United States. MAIN OUTCOMES: The impact wealth (parental homeownership and investments) had on cognitive development at 2 years and whether wealth eliminated the cognitive disparity seen between white, African American, and Hispanic children. PRINCIPAL RESULTS: Wealth (homeownership and investments) did not have an independent effect on cognitive development, but it did eliminate the disparity between white children and African American children (P ≥ .05). However, wealth did not eliminate the disparity in cognitive development between white children and Hispanic children. Hispanic children scored 3.91 points lower than white children (P ≤ .001). CONCLUSION: In contrast to other follow-up studies showing persistent differences in cognitive development between white children and African American children, this study found that wealth indicators attenuated the difference. Wealth may be a more accurate proxy for socioeconomic status in studying factors influencing cognitive outcomes in children born preterm than just using measures such as maternal education and income. In future follow-up studies of multiracial preterm children, indicators that represent wealth should be included for an accurate representation of social economic status.",

Inadequate knowledge regarding the underlying pathophysiology of this disease has contributed to the minimal progress made in decreasing the incidence and severity of NEC. Because of an improved survival rate of the most immature infants, the number of diagnosed cases of NEC is anticipated to increase. Unfortunately, decades of research have failed to reduce the risk or improve the prognosis of NEC, magnifying the need for risk-reduction strategies for decreasing significant NEC-related morbidity and mortality. Advancements in our understanding of this disease process have facilitated the development of several strategies that have been investigated in the risk reduction of NEC. This article discusses the pathophysiology and causes of NEC and presents strategies investigated regarding risk reduction of this devastating disease.",

Infants with CCHS have inadequate sensitivity to hypoxia and hypercapnia during sleep and in some cases during wakefulness, leading to persistent apnea. This article reports a case of CCHS in a 38-week-gestation infant who presented on day of life 2 with persistent apnea. Diagnosis of primary pulmonary, cardiac, metabolic, neurologic disease, or injury was excluded before the diagnosis of CCHS was made. The diagnosis was confirmed by a PHOX2B sequence analysis. A tracheotomy was performed and the infant was discharged home on a home ventilator with outpatient follow-up. The clinical presentation of CCHS, as well as diagnosis and treatment strategies, is reviewed.",

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all premature and at-risk infants undergo a period of observation in their car seat to monitor for apnea, bradycardia, and oxygen desaturation before hospital discharge. This Infant Car Seat Challenge (ICSC) is used to determine readiness for infant travel in a car seat. Infants failing the ICSC are discharged home in car beds and referred for a follow-up screen in the outpatient clinic.The purpose of this study was to identify predictors for infants failing the follow-up ICSC after hospital discharge.A retrospective, cross-sectional study design was used to examine charts of 436 infants referred from across New England, to Boston Children's Hospital's, Center for Healthy Infant Lung Development clinic between August 2008 and May 2015 for a follow-up ICSC.Infants who failed the follow-up ICSC had statistically significant lower weights (0.27 ± 0.14 kg, difference ± standard error, P = .03) and younger postmenstrual ages (0.9 ± 0.4 weeks, P = .03). History of a cardiac condition (odds ratio, 3.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-8.5; P = .005) and respiratory illness (odds ratio, 2.1; confidence interval, 1.1 to 4.2; P = .03) were significant predictors of ICSC failure.A follow-up ICSC is recommended for the safe transition of infants from a car bed to a car seat.Further research is needed to investigate the causes of ICSC failure among high-risk infant populations.",

Financial resources and support personnel are available to assist parents, but systems must be in place to help access these services. When neonatal intensive care unit nurses work collaboratively with financial support personnel, they improve families' access to financial resources.The purpose of this quality improvement initiative was to increase and facilitate timely parent referrals to health benefits coordinators (HBCs).Utilizing the Plan-Do-Study Act framework, the hospital's current system for HBC referrals was revised utilizing 3 Plan-Do-Study Act cycles.A substantial increase in the percentage of HBC referrals, from preimplementation of less than 5% to a sustained average of 90% was observed.A simple, sustainable screening process was successfully created to identify families with primary health insurance who qualified for coordination of benefits. This resulted in a significant increase in the number of HBC referrals. Minimal time is now required for the multidisciplinary team to ensure that parents, eligible for referral, are identified as soon as possible. Early identification and timely referral to the HBC may lessen the financial burden for families caring for children with medically complex long-term care needs by securing secondary insurance and other resources.Research focused on the financial impact of the HBC role is needed.",

    "abstract": "Extremely low birth-weight (ELBW) infants frequently receive packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions. Recent studies have shown that more restrictive PRBC transfusion guidelines limit donor exposure and reduce transfusion-related costs without any increase in adverse clinical outcomes.We developed and implemented an evidence-based PRBC transfusion guideline for ELBW infants treated in our unit and then measured provider adherence to this guideline.We performed a retrospective review of all PRBC transfusions given to ELBW infants in 2012 (preguideline) and the first half of 2014 (postguideline). We identified the indication for each transfusion by reviewing physiological/laboratory data and the daily clinical note. We then determine whether each transfusion met criteria according to our new evidence-based guideline.When extrapolating the newly developed protocol to 2012 data, less than 15% of transfusions among ELBW infants would have met the current evidence-based standard. Conversely, during the first 6 months of 2014, 61% of transfusions were administered in adherence to the guideline (P < 001). Using current cost estimates, this represents a projected cost savings of $31,000 in that 6-month period.A multidisciplinary approach to improving PRBC transfusion practices results in potentially safer, more cost-effective care for ELBW infants.Given the frequency, potential harms, and costs associated with PRBC transfusions in ELBW infants, it seems both feasible and important to pursue prospective clinical trials comparing permissive and restrictive approaches to transfusion in this vulnerable population.",

Palliative care was initially used along with life-extending care.With progression of the disease palliative care comes more to the forefront to help relieve physical and emotional suffering for not only the infant but the family, too. Offering nontraditional opportunities can help create a legacy and allow the families to know that their baby's life had meaning.Providing caregiver information on the diagnosis and specialized palliative care may improve infant and family outcomes.",

Neonates are immunosuppressed, placing them at increased risk for MSSA infections, including staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS), a rare severe skin presentation of MSSA. Clinical Findings: We present a case series of 3 preterm infants with SSSS receiving care at a level 3 neonatal intensive care unit. Primary Diagnosis: The infants presented with symptoms of sepsis, including temperature instability, apnea, and bradycardia episodes. The infants had peeling skin at sites of external pressure, including peripheral intravenous (IV) sites, under dressings, or where devices had been in contact with skin. Interventions: The infants were soaked in a tub with gel baby wash and water to remove leads without traumatizing the skin. Laboratory values were drawn, and cultures were obtained. Wound care was provided using mupirocin, soft silicone mesh wound contact layer, and soft cotton bandage gauze. Supportive respiratory care was provided, and IV antibiotics were administered. Outcomes: The infants were discharged to their homes with intact skin. One infant experienced a loss of pigment that persisted several weeks. All patients were without scarring by early childhood. Practice Recommendations: Thorough assessment and careful hygiene of neonates' skin is crucial. MSSA is an infection that can appear on the skin. It is important to quickly diagnose and treat this type of infection, especially when it presents as a localized pustule, boil, tear, peeling, or crust before it becomes systemic.",

    "abstract": "Dear NANN Colleagues, We receive many excellent manuscripts with information that can be easily adapted into the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) practice, but some subscribers/readers may miss out on the new information because they do not read every article. Maybe the title or the abstract did not grab their attention. No one can know for sure but for some reason they stopped reading the article before they got to the most important elements about the great quality improvement activities, research findings or bedside interventions. Writing a manuscript is hard work so you want to make sure others read it. How can you make sure to get your work noticed by others? Why not consider creating a video abstract to support your article? Video is everywhere today. Social media is taking over our world and even though we may not read all of our email we often scroll through social media posts when we have downtime. Think about the last time you were on Facebook, Tweeter, or Instagram; what made you stop to read a post or even \"click\" to read more of an article? We bet it could be the video content in the posts. The old saying \"a picture says a thousand words\" is true, but today a video can be even more powerful at pulling readers into a story. Creating a video abstract will increase the visibility and potential personal significance to the reader of your article. We know you agree but you also believe creating a video abstract will take special equipment, or cost a lot of money or time to create however, that's just not true. SO WHAT IS A VIDEO ABSTRACT? A video abstract is a short 3-5 minute video that tells the reader why they should read your article. Even authors with good speaking skills struggle with being video-taped; it can take a little practice. Begin by writing a few notes, but to really entice viewers let your clinical passion for your topic guide what to say about your work. Using the passion that motivated you to write the article can be your opening few words. Provide the reader with the background for why you chose to write the article, some insights about what made the work highlighted in the article important to you and your NICU practice. You might also provide some key take away points. The point of the video should be to get the reader to want to read the article so you don't want to say too much and you definitely don't want to just read your written abstract. We have provided detailed information about creating a video abstract in the Advances in Neonatal Care (ANC) author guidelines.1 In addition, Lippincott has provided two informative toolkits about the process with step-by-step guidelines that can also be accessed on the ANC Editorial Manager website (http://www.editorialmanager.com/anc/default.aspx) in the same place where you can find our author guidelines on the front page of the ANC Editorial Manager website under the \"Files and Resources\" area.2–3 In the toolkit about creating a video abstract, there are links to three examples of video abstracts published within other Lippincott journals.2 Each one is very different so watching them should help you to be creative about what you will include in your abstract. The second toolkit provides information on how to record a video abstract; particularly if you will be in a noisy environment where you might need a microphone or if you plan to use other recording equipment. Please do checkout these toolkits they are really quite helpful and contain pictures and screen shots to direct you through the process. A video abstract can be created on your tablet or smart phone with an external microphone. The microphone will enhance the quality of the sound if you are in a noisy environment. Lippincott provides recommendations for best microphones in their handouts but if you record in quiet place you may not need one anyway. Do a quick 15 second test run to see what the video looks like (your background) and how it sounds so you can make adjustments before you record the \"real\" video abstract and don't worry it may take a few tries to get it just right. Another way to create your video abstract is to use 3-5 PowerPoint slides and tape your voice over top the slides. This may be a good way to start if you are feeling uncomfortable in front of a camera. However, seeing your face and seeing your passion may be even better at getting others to read your article. We know the next words out of your mouth will be, \"I can't do that!\" But why not; we believe you can do just that!! We challenge you to do so. We are planning over the next few issues to choose the best video abstracts and play them at our booth at the NANN 2016 meeting in Palm Springs. It could be your video that we choose! We created a video abstract (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: https://links.lww.com/ANC/A13) to go with this editorial just to show you how easy it is to provide this type of media to highlight your work. SUMMARY Please do not be afraid of creating a video abstract to accompany your manuscript we are here to help you through this journey. If you need mentorship through the process, please let us know. We will put you in contact with one of our editorial board members to help guide you in choosing how best to highlight your work. We want you to be successful. So gather your ideas about what you want to do with your video and contact us; share your questions openly; there are no \"dumb\" questions. We want ANC to be the best clinical and research journal in neonatal care; articles with video abstracts can help us to grab a larger audience and they can also help you to get the word out about your great ideas.

    "abstract": "Poor feeding techniques result in adverse outcomes for preterm infants. Infant-driven feeding (IDF) is a structured feeding method that standardizes neonatal cue-based feedings, and matches the neurodevelopmental stage of the preterm infant. The purpose of this quality improvement project is to assess whether initiation of an IDF initiative impacts time from first nipple feed (NF) to full NF and to discharge in infants born before 35 weeks' gestational age. Secondary aims include assessment of the impact of IDF on neonatal growth and feasibility of following an IDF protocol in a level III neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).This quality improvement project assesses differences in time to first NF, length of hospital stay, and neonatal growth before and after usage of an IDF protocol. Eighty infants were included, 40 prior to and 40 after IDF intervention. Nurses were trained on IDF philosophy and methods prior to initiation.IDF was associated with discharge at a younger corrected gestational age (CGA), attainment of ad lib feeds at a younger CGA, and shorter amount of days between first NF and discharge. Infants utilizing IDF had slower weight gain, demonstrated by a larger drop in z score in the IDF group. The medical team and bedside nurses were able to follow the IDF protocol with few exceptions.IDF allows for optimization of a preterm infant's NICU stay and prepares infants for a safe discharge sooner. This could lead to increased parental satisfaction and decreased hospital cost. Further studies are indicated to ensure these benefits remain and focus on impact direct breastfeeding plays in the IDF model.",

    "abstract": "Air leaks, especially pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE), are increasingly uncommon respiratory complications of the newborn. Despite PIE having a decreasing incidence, it continues to have a high morbidity and mortality rate. This makes PIE one of the most severe respiratory complications to affect a newborn. Air leaks occur when there is overdistension of the terminal airways or alveoli, which results in air dissecting into extra-alveolar spaces. Recognizing the signs of air leaks is paramount to allow for appropriate diagnosis and treatment of the newborn to improve morbidity and mortality. Treatment modalities range from positioning the newborn in the decubitus position to surgical intervention.To summarize current evidence on the pathophysiology, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and management of PIE and pneumothorax.Two databases were systematically reviewed with key words later. Articles in English with date restrictions from 2016 to current were included.Inclusion criteria of randomized controlled trials, case studies/reports, and review articles were utilized. Twenty articles, primarily case reports and studies, were reviewed.Guidelines for data abstraction were followed via independent extraction by a single observer.Qualitative results were utilized to formulate current treatment of air leaks.This article provides guidance for frontline neonatal providers on current treatment and management of air leaks in the newborn population.",

Despite legislative efforts to increase pediatric drug development, neonatal clinical trials continue to be infrequent. The International Neonatal Consortium (INC) includes nurses as key stakeholders in their mission to accelerate safe and effective therapies for neonates.INC developed a survey for nurses, physicians, and parents to explore communication practices and stakeholders' perceptions and knowledge regarding clinical trials in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).A stepwise consensus approach was used to solicit responses to an online survey. The convenience sample was drawn from INC organizations representing the stakeholder groups. Representatives from the National Association of Neonatal Nurses and the Council of International Neonatal Nurses, Inc, participated in all stages of the survey development process, results analysis, and publication of results.Participants included 188 nurses or nurse practitioners, mainly from the United States, Canada, the European Union, and Japan; 68% indicated some level of research involvement. Nurses expressed a lack of effective education to prepare them for participation in research. Results indicated a lack of a central information source for staff and systematic approaches to inform families of studies. The majority of nurses indicated they were not asked to provide input into clinical trials. Nurses were uncertain about research consent and result disclosure processes.This study indicates the need to educate nurses in research, improve NICU research communication through standardized, systematic pathways, and leverage nurse involvement to enhance research communication.",

    "abstract": "An infant's cognitive development is highly dependent on early interactions with its primary caregiver, often its mother. Feeding, a frequent and early exchange between mothers and infants, is an important time for maternal-infant bonding. Mothers with opioid use disorder have been found to be more physically and verbally stimulating and more active during feeds than mothers with no opioid use.The purpose of this study was to describe the characteristics of verbal interactions mothers with opioid use disorder expressed while engaged in a feeding encounter with their infant undergoing treatment for neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome to offer insight into maternal experiences and potential challenges of feeding infants experiencing withdrawal.A qualitative descriptive analysis of maternal verbalizations during the feeding was used in a secondary analysis using the Barnard Model as the theoretical framework for maternal-infant interaction.A theory-driven deductive approach was assumed to organize the identified subthemes within the concepts of the Barnard Model. Mothers frequently commented on hunger, satiation, and stress cues, while providing consolation, praise, and encouragement. Mothers expressed concerns regarding feeding volume and pace, and consequences related to feeding.It is crucial that clinicians remember that feeding is an important time for maternal-infant bonding. Further research into the feeding interactions of mother-infant dyads with opioid exposure is warranted. As infants may present with subacute signs of withdrawal, including persistent feeding difficulties for months, further investigation into feeding challenges dyads experience after discharge from the hospital is needed.",

The auditory system hears sounds at 25 weeks' gestation; therefore, infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) may miss crucial language exposure during the period when neural pathways for language processing are developing. Supporting the synergistic relationship between fathers and newborns promotes connections through early language to strengthen engagement and promote infant neurodevelopment.To determine what is known about preterm infants' response to the male voice.Three databases and forward searching of reference lists were used to locate articles addressing the clinical question: \"What strategies can be used in the NICU to support purposeful language development?\"Empiric, primary research studies were included if they were published in English without date restriction.The authors evaluated each study's quality using a validated 16-item assessment tool (QATSDD) developed for studies with diverse designs; data were extracted and organized following Garrard's Matrix Method.The aim of this evidence-based review is to report the way an infant responds to the paternal voice. Findings promote a better understanding of individual infant response to paternal voice, including conversational turns and engagement behaviors. Although informative, this review highlights a clear gap in the evidence, supporting standardized methodology.Fathers should be encouraged to communicate vocally early and often to facilitate bonding in the NICU. Encouraged future study of father-infant communication to support bonding, relationship building, and neurodevelopmental outcomes is paramount.",

    "abstract": "Background: For infants requiring intensive care, infant length is a primary gauge of nutrition and forms the basis for important future treatment decisions. However, existing evidence demonstrates discrepancies in infant length measurements between tape measure and length board. Purpose: To compare the accuracy and reliability of infant length measurements using tape measure (standard practice) and length board in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at a public academic medical center. Methods: Using a single-group, quasi-experimental, repeated-measures design, 108 infants (35.58 ± 3.68 weeks, male 59%, 2124.83 ± 881.69 g) admitted to the NICU were prospectively enrolled. Clinical nurses measured infants weekly per unit-based protocol using tape measures. Study team measured length using length boards within 24 hours of tape measurement. Primary outcome was infant length. Length measurements were converted to sex-specific Fenton or WHO growth percentiles. Linear mixed-effects regression, κ coefficient, intraclass correlation coefficient, and positive predictive value were calculated. Findings/Results: The main effect of measurement conditions and time was significant. Predicted length was 0.38 cm lower for length board than for tape measure over time. Weighted κ coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficient indicated good to excellent agreement. More than 37% of infants shifted to a new percentile category based on both measurements. Positive predictive value of length board at time 1 was 63%. Implications for Practice: Length board measurements are reliable for accurate classification of an infant's growth curve to influence diagnosis and future plan of care. Implications for Research: Future research warrants replication using a longitudinal design across multiple sites.",

However, the current understanding of individual skin qualities and pigmentation has not yet been integrated thoroughly into foundational assessment courses, clinical education, simulation, and textbooks. Evidence Acquisition: Literature is scarce regarding racial groups, skin color, and physical assessment for patients across the lifespan, but even more so for the neonatal population. Historically, many nursing textbooks did not provide visual pictures or observational assessment strategies for the assessment of the Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) population. This is improving in some nursing textbooks; however, the descriptors of and visual differences and anticipated assessment findings for the BIPOC population are not comprehensive. Results: Evidence-based assessment findings, which may occur in newborns with varying skin tones/pigmentations, are presented. Implications for Practice and Research: The most essential step to having an accurate assessment is acknowledging the importance of color awareness. Color blindness, while thought to support inclusivity, only contributes to exclusion of one of the most important components of a person's being—their color.",

    "abstract": "Background: Although end-of-life care (EOLC) has been well-studied, the experience of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) nurses in China, where little EOLC training is provided, requires further investigation. Purpose: To explore the lived experience of EOLC delivery among NICU nurses, to provide evidence to enhance nurses' EOLC skills and improve their overall quality. Methods: This qualitative study adopted a phenomenological approach. A total of 11 NICU nurses participated in semistructured in-depth interviews between June and July 2022 at the First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). Colaizzi's 7-step method was used to analyze the data. Results: Five main themes were identified: ( a ) multiple emotions are experienced during EOLC delivery; ( b ) EOLC delivery is stressful from various sources for nurses; ( c ) expressing empathy and compassion is important; ( d ) ethical and clinical decision-making are key components of EOLC delivery; and ( e ) there are challenges in improving neonatal EOLC understanding and delivery. Implications for Practice and Research: The experience of EOLC among Chinese NICU nurses is multidimensional and intensive. Institutions or units must establish and implement related protocols and guidelines to address differences between clinical practice and ideal protocols for neonatal EOLC. Educational programs that consider nurses' personal and interpersonal factors, including local culture, must be developed. Neonatal nurses in Western countries encountering Chinese-born parents who have lost their infants can gain an understanding of parents' perceptions from this study. Future research should focus on developing and testing interventions to train and support NICU nurses working with end-of-life neonates.",

Previous research has explored barriers, facilitators, and some aspects of nurse competence in managing neonatal pain; however, this research has been predominantly performed in Western countries. To date, little is known about the barriers, facilitators, and perceived competence of Thai nurses and midwives in relation to neonatal pain management in NICUs. Exploring Thai nurses’ and midwives’ perceptions in these areas is crucial for understanding the contextual nuances of neonatal pain management, which can guide the provision of care for these high-risk neonates. Purpose: To investigate nurses’ and midwives’ perceptions of barriers, facilitators, and competence regarding effective neonatal pain management in Thai NICUs. Methods: Data were collected using virtual one-to-one, semistructured interviews with 12 neonatal nurses and midwives between July and August 2021 in 3 units of 2 tertiary hospitals in Southern Thailand. Inductive thematic analysis was used to examine interview data. Results: These data revealed following 3 major themes: ( a ) barriers to effective neonatal pain management, ( b ) facilitators of effective neonatal pain management, and ( c ) perceptions of competence. Implications for Practice: Assisting nurses and midwives in overcoming barriers and strengthening facilitators while enhancing their competence may result in better neonatal pain management. Implications for Research: This study adds to our understanding that further research is needed to develop the interventions designed to change at individual, unit, and organizational levels, particularly implementing parent-friendly visitation and ongoing professional development in neonatal pain management.",

Purpose: The purpose of this initiative is to track short-term outcomes as well as the program's effect on nursing workflow and job performance rating/satisfaction. Methods: A retrospective review of the ESC implementation process at CRMC from the years 2018-2020. The study consisted of 3 epochs: (1) traditional pharmacologic management; (2) parent-led ESC management; and (3) parent/nurse-led ESC management. Length of stay (LOS), treatment pathway assignment, and proportion of infants treated with pharmacologic agents were compared between epochs. In addition, a survey of NICU nursing staff was distributed to measure nurses' perceptions and attitudes towards the ESC program and the management of infants with NOWS. Results: The proportion of infants treated via ESC increased (0%, 53%, and 100%), with an associated decrease in LOS (18.4, 10.5, and 9.3 days) during each epoch of the study period. Thirty-seven nurses completed the survey, with 94% of nurses reporting being comfortable caring for ESC patients and 89% feeling supported in their ESC nursing assignments, with only 11% stating that caring for ESC patients significantly alters their other nursing care processes. Implications for Practice and Research: Implementation of an ESC treatment program for infants with NOWS significantly decreased LOS and the proportion of infants treated pharmacologically. This phased implementation process was not associated with self-reported negative nursing perceptions of the program and its treatment goals/outcomes.",

Neonatal nurses have ongoing contact with women who have had a preterm birth and, thus, who are at high risk to have another preterm birth. This article discusses current evidence about reducing risk for preterm birth. Although preterm birth cannot always be prevented, preconception care can help identify and modify maternal risk and promote optimal health before conception. Quality prenatal care, as defined by the Institute of Medicine, consists of continuing risk assessment, health promotion, and interventions to modify medical and psychosocial risk. When these 3 components are consistently applied, they may confer some protection against preterm birth. Women at highest risk for preterm birth need to seek prenatal care from an expert in maternal-fetal medicine. Women also need to learn about the common, subtle signs of preterm labor so they can recognize symptoms and quickly seek treatment. Neonatal nurses can provide critical information and anticipatory guidance to women at risk for preterm birth so they can make sound decisions about future pregnancies.",

    "abstract": "Spinal dysraphism, an incomplete closure of the neural tube, can be open, exposing the neural elements to the environment, or can be closed, covered with skin. Abnormal development of the spine occurs early in life and also interferes with usual development of the skin. This often creates cutaneous markers or stigmata over the area. Cutaneous markers may include a subcutaneous mass, abnormal hair growth, skin dimple, tag or sinus, or unusual pigmentation. Recognizing these markers is important because, although many closed spinal dysraphisms are asymptomatic at birth, neurological sequelae can occur. The sequelae are insidious and often permanent. This article, Part 3 in a series of articles devoted to spinal assessment, reviews closed spinal dysraphisms. The article emphasizes identification of various cutaneous markers associated with closed spinal dysraphisms. Early detection and follow-up may prevent neurologic sequelae for the infant later in life.",

SUBJECTS Thirty-four healthy pre- and full-term neonates and 40 sick pre- and full-term neonates. DESIGN Descriptive, comparative. Methods Within the first 15–30 seconds of life, a pulse oximeter probe was placed on the dorsum of the neonate's foot. The signal was uploaded from the Hewlett Packard Viridia cardiopulmonary/oxygen saturation monitor to a data acquisition module at the bedside. Healthcare personnel performed their routine caregiving procedures for the neonate beginning transition to extrauterine life. They were at liberty to administer oxygen when they felt it was clinically necessary. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry. PRINCIPAL RESULTS Oxygen saturation values reached higher levels much faster for all groups of neonates than what has been previously reported in the literature. CONCLUSIONS In light of recent controversies regarding oxygen therapy, the practice of randomly administering oxygen to healthy infants at time of delivery should be examined.",

This article provides state-of-the-art insight into the evidence or lack thereof for the changes in guidelines.To discuss the evidence for evolution of DR management of vigorous and nonvigorous infants born through any type of MSAF.Review of guidelines from the Neonatal Resuscitation Program of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, Consensus on Science and Treatment Recommendations, and textbooks of neonatal resuscitation and research using MEDLINE via PubMed.In pregnancies complicated by MSAF, intrapartum suctioning of the oro- and nasopharynx and postnatal intubation with tracheal suctioning of infants have been traditionally used to clear the airway and decrease meconium aspiration syndrome. The recommendations for these perinatal practices have changed several times due to some evidence that the procedures are not beneficial and may even be harmful.Intrapartum suctioning and postnatal tracheal suctioning of infants (vigorous or nonvigorous) born through MSAF are not recommended. This is a \"high-risk\" delivery requiring 2 team members to be present at birth-one with full resuscitation skills including tracheal intubation.Need to evaluate effects of discontinuing the practice of tracheal suctioning in nonvigorous infants on the incidence of meconium aspiration syndrome and neonatal mortality.",

Feeding errors and disruptions or limitations to feeding processes in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are associated with negative safety events. Feeding errors include contamination of milk and delivery of incorrect or expired milk and may result in adverse gastrointestinal illnesses.The purpose of this review was to evaluate the effect(s) of centralized milk preparation, use of trained technicians, use of bar code-scanning software, and collaboration between registered dietitians and registered nurses on feeding safety in the NICU.A systematic review of the literature was completed, and 12 articles were selected as relevant to search criteria. Study quality was evaluated using the Downs and Black scoring tool.An evaluation of human studies indicated that the use of centralized milk preparation, trained technicians, bar code-scanning software, and possible registered dietitian involvement decreased feeding-associated error in the NICU.A state-of-the-art NICU includes a centralized milk preparation area staffed by trained technicians, care supported by bar code-scanning software, and utilization of a registered dietitian to improve patient safety. These resources will provide nurses more time to focus on nursing-specific neonatal care.Further research is needed to evaluate the impact of factors related to feeding safety in the NICU as well as potential financial benefits of these quality improvement opportunities.",

The data were collected with an open question at discharge and 3, 6, and 12 months after the expected birth date and analyzed using thematic analysis.A typology of breastfeeding mothers of preterm infants was created. The group of survivors wished to be breastfeeding mothers, but after some unexpected difficulties, they had to give up their dream. The disappointment alleviated with time, but some of the mothers still harbored self-accusations after a year. The highfliers were mothers who succeeded in breastfeeding because of their own persistence. They described breastfeeding as enjoyable for both the mother and the infant. The pragmatist mothers breastfed because it was the general norm and a practical way to feed the infant; breastfeeding caused neither passion nor discomfort. The group of bottle-feeding-oriented mothers expressed that breastfeeding did not interest them at any point.Being aware of the typology could help nurses and midwives carefully observe mothers' individual counselling needs. Mothers' wishes and decisions regarding breastfeeding need to be respected and supported without any judgment.The possibilities to tailor breastfeeding interventions based on the typology should be investigated.",

    "abstract": "Globally, stillbirths account for 2.7 million infant deaths each year, with the vast majority occurring in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Approximately 900,000 infants die due to birth asphyxia. The focus of the Helping Babies Breathe (HBB) program is to help the nonbreathing infant to breathe within the first minute of life, termed the \"Golden Minute.\"To present a multinational interprofessional development program utilizing the train-the-trainer methodology for HBB to address neonatal morbidity and mortality. Involving nursing students in collaboration with established global partners provided an innovative method of professional development. Lessons learned and challenges will be shared to enhance success of future efforts.HBB train-the-trainer workshops were held to provide professional development for nurses and nursing students in 5 locations in 4 countries including Ethiopia, India, Vietnam, and Zambia. Workshop participants and the trainers participated in discussions and informal conversation to assess impact on professional development.HBB training and train-the-trainer workshops were implemented in 4 counties. Equipment and supplies were provided in these countries through several internal university grants. All 145 participants demonstrated increased knowledge and skills at the end of the workshops through the HBB check off. Collaborative teaching and cross-cultural professional skills were enhanced in student and faculty trainers.Nurses, midwives, and advance practice nurses can engage globally and contribute to closing this gap in knowledge and skills by providing train-the-trainer workshops.Developing systems to integrate the HBB program within each country's existing healthcare infrastructure promotes in-country ownership. Joining the global effort to save the lives of neonates can be a meaningful opportunity for innovative professional development projects. While HBB education has been shown to save lives, a 1-time training is insufficient. Determining how often HBB updates or refreshers are required to maintain skills is an important next step. Another direction for research is to implement this project within prelicensure nursing programs.",

This phenomenon refers to an overwhelming acute infection that interferes with testing by antibody flocculation or clumping of antibodies, causing a false-negative result and allows an infection such as syphilis to go undetected during pregnancy when Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test is performed.The infant received a 10-day course of aqueous penicillin G 150,000 U/kg every 8 hours per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Redbook recommendations for congenital neurosyphilis.The infant was discharged home on day of life 38 and was followed as an outpatient with serial rapid plasma reagin titers confirming adequate treatment of congenital neurosyphilis. He was also referred to the high-risk infant clinic to monitor for developmental milestones secondary to prematurity and central nervous system infection.Providers within the neonatal setting should consider early congenital syphilis testing on infants with similar clinical presentation regardless of negative maternal testing.",

Purpose: Decrease the risk of overheating or suffocation by removing NICU infants' hats during sleep without increasing the relative risk of hypothermia during transition to an open crib. Methods: Removal of hats for routine thermoregulation, beyond the initial infant resuscitation and stabilization of NICU infant was implemented in 2015. Retrospective chart audits were conducted on all NICU infants between February 2015 and December 2016. Hypothermia (≤ 97.6°F) data during transition to an open crib was collected. Exclusion criteria included concurrent diagnosis of: sepsis, hyperbilirubinemia, congenital anomaly inhibiting infants thermoregulation and noncompliance with unit guideline for weaning infant to open crib. Findings: Over 18 months, 2.7% of infants became hypothermic (≤ 97.6°F) during transition to open crib, requiring return to isolettes. Implications for Practice: Hats were found to be unnecessary in maintaining thermoneutrality after weaning infants toan open crib in our NICU. By avoiding the use of hats in an open crib, it's possible infants will avoid overheating and a risk of suffocation, creating a safer sleep environment. Implications for Research: The removal of hats during sleep to promote infant health should be considered for all infants.",

Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can be used to noninvasively monitor regional oxygen saturations (rSO 2 ). Clinical Findings: This former 28-week female premature infant, 29 days old, received an RBC transfusion due to increased apneic spells and a hematocrit of 27%. Within 24 hours she developed abdominal distension and passed a bloody stool (Bell's stage 2 NEC on abdominal x-ray). She completed 7 days of antibiotics and nothing-by-mouth status and was discharged home on room air and oral feedings on day of life 70. Primary Diagnosis: We describe the presentation of NEC following a RBC transfusion in a preterm infant monitored with cerebral and splanchnic NIRS. Interventions: Mean rSO 2 (cerebral and splanchnic) measurements were continuously recorded and calculated in 30-minute periods at baseline (prior to packed RBC transfusion), every hour during the RBC transfusion, and every 3 hours for the following 48 hours. Outcomes: In this infant, average baseline splanchnic rSO 2 was low at 46.5%, and increased during transfusion to 65%. However, following the RBC transfusion and an enteral feeding, splanchnic rSO 2 dramatically decreased to 26%, and remained low until the time of NEC diagnosis. Practice Recommendations: To develop awareness of the increased risk for NEC in premature infants with significant anemia that receive packed RBC transfusions. With further studies and education, NIRS could be a valuable tool for the nurses and medical team to identify these at-risk neonates.",

Directed content analysis explored themes within the interviews using systematic strategies to ensure rigor.Unit leadership described 3 main features of care delivery necessary for supporting parent engagement: (1) culture of care, (2) relationships in care, and (3) environment of care. Communication among providers and parents and timing of decision-making were key areas addressed, along with concerns about physical space limiting parent engagement. Unit leaders discussed how the 3 main features (unit culture, relationships, and physical space) of care delivery were interconnected to optimize parent engagement.Overall, unit leaders recognized the importance of each feature of care delivery in facilitating engagement. Parent engagement is ultimately influenced by the optimization of delivering inclusive care: the physical space, the policies surrounding medical and nursing care, and the overall culture of the unit.Future research needs to explore best practices around relationship building and managing space limitations. Further clarification of the needs and expectations of both parents and providers surrounding parent engagement in intensive care settings is needed.",

Purpose: To compare stress in NICU nurses who work in single-family room (SFR) or open bay (OBY) units and on nonrotating day or night shift. Methods: Full-time registered nurses (RNs) (n = 72) from a 42-bed SFR and a 131-bed OBY NICU participated in this comparative cross-sectional study. The Nurse Stress Scale (NSS) and within-shift repeated salivary cortisol levels were used to measure stress. The relationship between NSS score and salivary cortisol level was examined using multiple linear regression. Salivary cortisol levels of day versus night shift were compared with mixed-effects linear models. Results: NSS scores were similar for SFR and OBY units ( P = .672) and day versus night shift ( P = .606). Changes in cortisol level over time ( P = .764) and final cortisol level ( P = .883) for SFR versus OBY were not significantly different after controlling for shift. Salivary cortisol level of day-shift nurses decreased significantly over time compared with night-shift nurses ( P &lt; .001). The final cortisol level was significantly higher for night-shift compared with day-shift nurses ( P &lt; .001). Implications for Practice: Psychological (NSS) and physiologic (salivary cortisol) stress of NICU nurses is similar in established SFR and OBY units. Cortisol levels are higher at the end of shift in nurses who work night shift and may reflect increased physiologic stress. Implications for Research: Strategies are needed for reducing stress in NICU nurses who work night shift.",

Transfer of care from the operating room (OR) to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) adds another layer of risk for this population introducing the potential for miscommunication leading to preventable adverse events.The aim of this quality improvement initiative is to decrease mean postoperative hypothermia rate and achieve compliance with use of a standardized postoperative hand-off in neonates transferred to the NICU from the OR.An interdisciplinary team identified opportunities for heat loss during the perioperative period. The lack of standardized perioperative communication between the NICU and the OR and postoperative communication between neonatology, anesthesiology, surgery, and nursing were noted. Guidelines for maintaining euthermia in the perioperative period and a standardized interdisciplinary postoperative hand-off communication tool were created.Mean rate for participation in the hand-off process increased from 78.8% to 98.4% during the study period. The mean hypothermia rate improved from 28.6% to 6.3% (P < .0001) and was sustained.Creating a hypothermia guideline and standardizing temperature monitoring can significantly decrease the rate of postoperative hypothermia in neonates. Standardization of transfer of care from OR to NICU increases consistent communication between the services.Future research and improvement efforts are needed to optimize the management of surgical neonates through their transfers of care.",

    "abstract": "Infants discharged from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) dependent on medical technology (eg, respiratory or nutritional support) are a growing vulnerable population. These infants are medically fragile, prone to emergency department visits and readmissions, and require increased caregiver demands at home. The experiences of their maternal caregiver's after NICU discharge however, are not well understood.This qualitative descriptive study addressed this knowledge gap by interviewing mothers of technology-dependent infants about their experience during their first 2 weeks transitioning to home from the NICU. This is a critical period in which mothers must first assume advanced caretaking responsibilities in the home.Eight mothers participated in semistructured audio-recorded interviews via the Web conferencing system Zoom and completed demographic questionnaires.Five themes emerged from the data that described essential features of the mothers' transition to home: (a) needing coordinated discharge care; (b) establishing a routine; (c) being an advocate; (d) having a support system; and (e) finding normalcy. An additional important finding of this study was the presence of maternal posttraumatic stress and postpartum depression.Results highlight the importance of providing mothers hands-on practice opportunities and identifying social support and home healthcare options prior to discharge of technology-dependent infants.Future research should focus on multidisciplinary interventions targeted toward discharge preparation, transitional support, and understanding maternal psychiatric symptoms among mothers of technology-dependent infants.",

    "abstract": "Neonatal hypoglycemia is a common metabolic problem. Critically ill neonates require effective glucose metabolism to survive and thrive. Timely and urgent transport of these neonates from a level I/II nursery to a level III NICU is often needed related to complex medical and nursing care requirements. The stabilization phase prior to transport can be chaotic, resulting in a less than optimal frequency of glucose testing. Inadequate testing may result in undetected hypoglycemia that can lead to lifelong and serious neurodevelopmental sequela. The internationally utilized S.T.A.B.L.E. curriculum, which guides postresuscitation/pretransport stabilization, has an evaluative component known as the Pretransport Stabilization Self-Assessment Tool (PSSAT). This tool allows the referral hospital staff and transport team to track glucose levels during the pretransport phase of care at 3 distinct points in time. Utilization of the PSSAT has been shown to successfully prompt glucose testing that is reflective of the S.T.A.B.L.E. curriculum.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this article was to present the case of a premature infant who displayed immature feeding progression because of nasal occlusion. Two male preterm infants of 33 weeks' gestational age at birth from a larger randomized trial were observed in a comparative case study. Using a prospective design, feeding assessments were conducted weekly from initiation of oral feeding until hospital discharge. Sucking organization was measured using the Medoff-Cooper Nutritive Sucking Apparatus (M-CNSA), which measured negative sucking pressure generated during oral feedings. Oral and nasogastric (NG) intake and vital signs were recorded. At 35 weeks, infant A demonstrated an immature feeding pattern with the M-CNSA NG feedings prevailing over oral feedings. When attempting to feed orally, infant A exhibited labored breathing and an erratic sucking pattern. During the third weekly feeding evaluation, nasal occlusion was discovered, the NG tube was discontinued, and phenylephrine (Neo-Synephrine) and humidified air were administered. Following treatment, infant A's sucking pattern normalized and the infant maintained complete oral feeding. Infant B demonstrated normal feeding progression. Nasal occlusion prevented infant A from achieving successful oral feeding. The M-CNSA has the ability to help clinicians detect inconsistencies in the sucking patterns of infants and objectively measures patterns of nutritive sucking. The M-CNSA has the potential to influence clinical decision making and identify the need for intervention.",

    "abstract": "Background: More than 95% of higher-order multiples are born preterm and more than 90% are low birth weight, making this group of infants especially vulnerable to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Emerging evidence suggests that families with twins face challenges adhering to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommendations to reduce SIDS risks. Adherence to the AAP recommendations in families with higher-order multiples has not been described. Purpose: This study describes SIDS risk reduction infant care practices for higher-order multiples during the first year of life. Methods: Mothers caring for higher-order multiple-birth infants were recruited from an online support group. An online survey was used to assess infant care practices when the infants were first brought home from the hospital as well as at the time of the survey. Results: Ten mothers of triplets and 4 mothers of quadruplets responded. Less than 80% of the mothers practiced “back to sleep” immediately postdischarge. Supine sleep positioning decreased over time, particularly during daytime naps. Only 50% of the infants shared the parents' bedroom and approximately 30% bed-shared with their siblings. Sleep-time pacifier use was low. Implications for Practice: Safe sleep education must include specific questions regarding home sleeping arrangements, encouragement of breast milk feedings, supine positioning, and pacifier use at every sleep for higher-order multiple infants well before discharge in order for parents to plan a safe sleep environment at home. Implications for Research: Prospective studies to identify barriers and facilitators can inform future strategies supporting adherence to safe sleep practices for higher-order multiple infants.",

The impact of the Boost Curtain on temperature when opening the portholes during the incubator mode was also examined. Mixed-effects linear models and the log-rank test were used to analyze patient data to determine the effect of thermal support on temperature and humidity changes during care, as well as during the postcare period.Entering the incubator through the portholes improved temperature control compared with using the canopy mode. The Boost Curtain resulted in an overall temperature stability and heat gain.Nurses caring for premature infants in hybrid incubators should minimize incubator openings and utilize portholes rather than the canopy whenever practical. The Boost Curtain should be used when opening the portholes during the incubator mode.Comparing time, accuracy, and tolerance of procedures in the canopy versus incubator modes would improve nurses' ability to determine the best approach for different clinical scenarios.",

Historically transports utilized a neonatal nurse practitioner or neonatal transport nurse and 2 medics. A regulatory ruling at the state level mandated change in team composition. This institution elected to educate neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) staff nurses to become the providers for transports and to respond to deliveries requiring the NICU team. These nurses became the transport-delivery room nurse.To implement a transport care delivery model in response to the new regulatory ruling and measure the impact of the change on care indices.The new care delivery model involved the creation and implementation of a new role for the NICU nurse. NICU nurses were queried regarding their interest and 35 nurses received educational training. Two metrics were tracked to evaluate the success of the model for 1 full year prior to and monthly after implementation. The 2 metrics were axillary temperature on admission to the NICU from the delivery room and mean length of time of stabilization of the neonate at the referral hospital.The length of time to stabilize the neonate at the referring hospital was reduced by a mean of 7 minutes. Percentages of newborns admitted to the NICU from labor and delivery with an axillary temperature of greater than 36.3°C increased from 65% to 77%.Nurses with specialized skill sets positively impact neonatal outcomes. Further investigations should involve the impact this role has on nurse and community satisfaction.",

The relationships between immunization status and study variables were examined using t tests and logistic regression.Of 43 infants discharged at least 60 days of age or older from the NICU, 74.4% were fully immunized in accordance with American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommendations. Significant predictors were age at discharge for immunization and steroid use for nonimmunization.Immunization needs to be a priority in order to give NICU infants every advantage regarding their future health status. Nurses need to implement hospital policies ensuring immunizations of NICU graduates.Future studies should focus on samples from diverse hospitals and levels of NICUs. Qualitative studies exploring and describing parent and provider knowledge of current AAP guidelines will strengthen our understanding of potential barriers to immunization.",

    "abstract": "Background: Although the concepts of uncertainty and anticipated loss have been explored in a variety of contexts, advances in genetic testing and life-sustaining technology rendered changes in the care of medically complex infants. The separate concepts no longer have the descriptive power to clarify new phenomena endured by parents in the changing neonatal landscape. A current concept analysis examining uncertainty in anticipated loss is necessary to generate knowledge concurrently with deviations observed in the neonatal intensive care unit. Purpose: To explore the concept of uncertainty in anticipated loss among parents of infants with genetic disorders. Methods: Following Rodgers' method of concept analysis, the concept was named, surrogate terms, antecedents, attributes, and consequences were identified from the literature, and a model case was constructed. The databases CINAHL, PubMed, and PsycINFO were used to conduct the literature search. Results: Fifteen articles provided the data for this analysis. Uncertainty in anticipated loss is a complex, nonlinear, and multifaceted experience anteceded by an ultimately terminal diagnosis, an ambiguous prognosis, and a lack of clear knowledge to guide treatment. Its attributes include a loss of control, assumptive world remodeling, role/identity confusion, and prolonged emotional complexity that consequently leads to a cyclical pattern of positive and negative outcomes. Implications: This newly defined concept empowers neonatal nurses to provide care that includes a holistic understanding of the experience of uncertainty in anticipated loss . Nurses are ideally positioned and have the responsibility to utilize this concept to become better advocates for infants and facilitators of parental wellness.",

Evidence-based practice guidelines, crafted specifically for this population, are needed to effectively manage their care. In an effort to meet the needs of the near-term infant (NTI) population, and concurrently address the needs of the convalescing premature infants reverse transported to a Level II nursery setting, a multidisciplinary team of clinicians designed tools to provide a more consistent approach to care for and discharge these infants. This article describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of an evidence-based multidisciplinary clinical pathway specific to the needs of the NTI, including care plans, a standardized physician admission and discharge order set, evidence-based interventions, parent education, and recommendations for follow-up after hospital discharge that were developed for use in a Level II nursery. The use of the premature and near-term infant pathway has now been expanded to NTIs cared for in the newborn nursery, thereby ensuring safe, consistent, quality care for this population, regardless of their setting.",

Newborn infants require at least one blood sample for mandatory genetic screening. Some will require additional samples for monitoring of hyperbilirubinemia or other laboratory tests. A change from capillary heel sticks to venipuncture was implemented when the lancets in use were discontinued and a suitable replacement could not be found at the time. A review of the literature discovered a Cochrane Neonatal Review that supported newborn venipuncture as a safe, pain-reducing practice when performed by trained phlebotomists. As a result, a quality improvement project was developed to implement the practice of venipuncture for the well newborn. The implementation and evaluation included lectures, demonstrations, return demonstrations, and eventual integration into clinical practice. Process and summative evaluation demonstrated a willingness of staff to learn a new procedure, particularly when they had identified the need for change. In addition, infants were not subjected to multiple, ineffective blood draws.",

The typical patient with acute renal failure is premature, but many term infants are also at risk. One such group is those with severe bleeding, such as a subgaleal hemorrhage. In these cases, hypovolemia can quickly progress to ischemia, which affects many organs but has profound effects on the kidney. In term infants, acute renal failure is most commonly diagnosed in those with perinatal depression. This article presents a unique case of an infant with subgaleal and intracranial bleeding that resulted in acute renal failure requiring peritoneal dialysis in the hopes of the eventual restoration of kidney function.",

Although interventions for smoking cessation during pregnancy demonstrate effectiveness for increasing smoking abstinence, the majority of women relapse in the postpartum period. However, modifying contributing factors for relapse may improve the success of sustained abstinence. Many parents are eager to quit smoking and willing to participate in smoking cessation interventions. Through a population-based approach to healthcare, neonatal nurses are in an ideal position to prevent relapse and to promote smoking abstinence; they can coordinate and lead efforts for establishing smoking cessation strategies that integrate obstetric, newborn, and pediatric services.",

Although we do not yet know how this change will affect our patients, our practice, or us, we do know that with change comes opportunity. We have the opportunity to become more involved in health policy and advocacy than ever before. Many nurses are already taking the first steps, which are recognizing the importance of advocacy and articulating the issues that they believe are of greatest importance. To communicate their views to the right elected officials, nurses need to be aware of how government operates and how legislation is created and shepherded through the legislative process. Nurses must learn the fundamental principles of expressing themselves and making clear requests for what they want of their elected officials. With these skills, every nurse can become an advocate in the political arena and partner with other individuals or groups to facilitate change. Nurses who find this experience rewarding and exhilarating can pursue additional education in health policy and advocacy.",

For each infant, the following data were collected: gender, left and right arm position, left and right leg position, and tightness of wrap.In total, 132 swaddle observations were recorded. There was significant variability in swaddling positioning of arms and legs. The most common combination of arm/leg positioning was \"mixed arm positioning\" and \"both legs flexed\" (25.0% of all observations). In 9.1% of cases, tightness of wrap around chest was \"tight,\" and in 30.3% of cases, tightness of wrap around legs was \"tight.\"There was a large variability in swaddling positioning of both arms and legs. For such a widespread practice, the lack of medical guidelines results in inconsistent, and potentially harmful, positioning. Parents and healthcare professionals would benefit from specific, research-driven guidelines regarding proper swaddling techniques.Different variations on swaddling should be evaluated for consideration of best practice swaddling.",

Implementation of standardized teaching focused on the teach-back technique. Education included mixing demonstration and written instructions. Parents were expected to correctly mix the recipe 3 times before discharge.Mixing accuracy at the initial clinic follow-up visit improved to 97%. No readmissions were reported from inaccurately prepared feedings.Collaborative quality improvement project with standardized teaching provided improved feeding safety and parental comfort with accuracy of discharge instructions.

Relationships of the NEC-Zero adherence score to NEC rates were examined. Subgroup analyses explored relationships of a human milk adherence subscore and differences between high NEC rate (≥8%) and low NEC rate (≤2%) NICUs.NICUs (N = 76) ranged in size from 18 to 114 beds. The mean adherence score was 7.3 (standard deviation = 1.7; range, 3-10). The 10-point adherence score was not related to the NEC rate. The human milk subscore related to lower NEC rates (Rho = -0.26, P = .049), as was colostrum for oral care (Rho = -0.27, P = .032). The units that used a feeding protocol showed higher NEC rates (Rho = 0.27, P = .03), although very few addressed the use of effective implementation strategies to track adherence or to ensure consistency among clinicians. The units that used colostrum for oral care were more likely to adopt strategies to limit inappropriate antibiotic exposure (Rho = 0.34, P = .003).Broader use of evidence-based implementation strategies could bolster delivery of NEC prevention practices. Maternal lactation support is paramount.Future studies are needed to identify how individual clinicians deliver prevention practices, to find the extent to which this relates to overall delivery of prevention, and to study effects of bundles on NEC outcomes.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mother's own milk (MOM) is preferred when feeding preterm infants. When expressed mother's milk is stored and handled, there is a risk of bacterial contamination, decreased immunological activity, and less nutritional potential. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate current routines when handling MOM in Danish neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). METHODS: A survey was sent to all 17 NICUs in Denmark in which current practices regarding human milk handling, storage, and preparation were evaluated. Furthermore, one question sought to establish when mother's milk was believed to be colostrum. Respondents of the survey were neonatal nurses. RESULTS: All 17 units responded to the survey. Only 5 of 17 units answered that human colostrum was defined as milk from the first week after birth. Refrigerator storage time varied between 24 and 72 hours. In 6 of 17 units, parents were in charge of mixing milk and fortifier. Heating of human milk was done by using microwave ovens in 4 of 17 of the units. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This national survey established that there is significant variability in the way mother's milk is handled. Some of the procedures performed may affect the quality of the milk. It is important to implement evidence-based practice regarding storage and handling of expressed mother's milk to ensure that the quality of the milk is the best possible alternative for all preterm infants. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Prospective studies are needed to examine the association between handling of human milk and changes in composition and nutritional potential of the milk.",

    "abstract": "With advancements in neonatology, patients in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are living in the hospital with complex life-limiting illnesses until their first birthday or beyond. As palliative care (PC) becomes a standard of care in neonatology, a level IV NICU developed an interdisciplinary PC team with the mission to ease the physical, mental, and moral distress of the patients, families, and staff. This case report highlights the teamwork and long-term palliative care and ultimately end-of-life care that an infant received by this dedicated NICU palliative care team.This case discusses a premature ex-27-week gestation male infant who initially presented to the emergency department at 5 months of age with significant tachypnea, increased work of breathing, and poor appetite.The primary diagnosis was severe pulmonary vein stenosis resulting in severe pulmonary hypertension.The severity of the infant's pulmonary vein stenosis was incurable. He required substantial life-extending surgical procedures and daily intensive care interventions. In addition to his life-extending therapies, the infant and his family received palliative care support by the NICU PC team and the hospital-wide PC team (REACH team) throughout his admission. This was specialized care that focused on easing pain and suffering while also addressing any social/emotional needs in the infant, his family, and in the hospital staff. The PC teams also focused on protecting the families' goals of care, memory making, and providing a positive end-of-life experience for the infant and his family. The infant's end-of-life care involved providing adequate pain and symptom management, education, and communication to his family about the dying process and allowing unlimited family time before and after his death.After 11 months in the NICU and despite aggressive therapies, he required more frequent trips to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for restenosis of his pulmonary veins. He was dependent on iNO to treat his pulmonary hypertension and he continued to require an ICU ventilator. His parents ultimately decided to pursue comfort care. He died peacefully in his mother's arms.The American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Association of Neonatal Nurses both have statements recommending that palliative care be standard of care in NICUs. Establishing a NICU-dedicated interdisciplinary PC team can improve outcomes for infants and families living in the NICU with complex life-limiting illnesses.",

Low percentages of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) nurses support mothers facing barriers to establishing and sustaining adequate milk supplies. Nurses' motivations and attitudes are instrumental, but understudied, factors in their intention to promote maternal lactation. Purpose: Using the Theory of Reasoned Action, this study explored (1) NICU nurses' attitudes, social pressures, feelings of preparedness, perceptions of comfort, and intention to support lactation; and (2) magnitude of relationships among these concepts before and after undertaking an educational module. Methods: A descriptive pre-/postintervention design included a sample of 24 NICU nurses who completed a module, including general lactation and hands-on expressing information. The Nursing Support for Breastfeeding Questionnaire was administered before and after completing the module. Results: Attitudes, social norms, perception of preparedness, and intention were moderate to high before and after completion of the module. Perception of comfort was moderate. When comparing pre- and postintervention, effect sizes for intention and perception of comfort were moderate. Magnitude of the relationship between attitudes and intention was strong before intervention and moderate after intervention. Subjective norms demonstrated stronger relationships with attitudes and intention after intervention. Preparedness and comfort had stronger relationships with attitudes than with intention both before and after intervention. Implications for Practice: Nurses' attitudes, perception of preparedness, and comfort are modifiable considerations in developing strategies to support evidence-based lactation techniques. Implications for Research: Additional studies are needed with fully powered and stronger designs to validate findings to guide interventions for nurse support for NICU mothers to optimize lactation.",

Median travel time from home to the hospital was 32 minutes (range, 2-135 minutes). Lactation consultants were the largest group providing information, with 44 participants (45%) identifying them as the primary information source. Knowledge about recommended refrigerator storage times for expressed milk was correct in 53 mothers (54%).

Despite the importance of feeding as a growth-fostering process, little empiric evidence exists to guide recommendations for early interventions. Purpose: Evaluate whether specific elements of sucking, during preterm initiation of oral feeding, predict sucking organization at corrected term age. Methods: Sucking performance of 88 preterm infants born between 24 and 34 weeks of post–menstrual age was measured at baseline and term (33-35 and 40 ± 1.5 weeks). Participants were divided into 4 groups (quartiles) based on initial measures of performance including number of sucks, number of bursts, sucks per burst, and maximum pressure. Stability in sucking organization was assessed by comparing changes in infant's quartile location from baseline to term. Results: A correlation between quartile location was observed for mean maximum pressure (PMAX): infants with PMAX in the lowest quartile (poorest performance) were significantly more likely to remain in the lowest quartile at term ( P &lt; .000); infants in the highest quartile (best performance) at baseline were significantly more likely to be in the highest quartile at term ( P &lt; .000). Implication for Practice: Infants with the weakest sucking pressures at 34 weeks of post–menstrual age continue to be at risk for less than optimal feeding skills at 40 weeks of post–menstrual age. Early identification of at-risk infants may allow for effective interventions to potentially decrease long-term feeding problems. Implications for Research: Future research should focus on the development of personalized interventions to address attributes of problematic feeding such as sucking efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Over the past 20 years, the recognition of nitric oxide (NO) as an endothelial-derived vasodilator has led to remarkable advances in vascular biology awareness. The signaling molecule NO, produced by NO synthase, is a molecule that is widespread in the body and important in multiple organ systems. Soon after its discovery, investigators found NO to be a potent pulmonary vasodilator in term neonates. Nitric oxide has come to perform a key function in neonatal therapy and management since its identification, especially in those with respiratory failure. It is conventionally used in the neonatal population for the treatment of persistent pulmonary hypertension, resulting in hypoxic respiratory failure of the term or near-term newborn. Inhaled NO has been successful in acutely improving oxygenation and in reducing the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment. In recent years, the efficacy of inhaled NO for the prevention of pulmonary disability as well as its neuroprotective capabilities in preterm infants has been explored.",

A head computed tomography (CT) demonstrated large bilateral subdural hematomas with midline shift secondary to packed red blood cell infusion via an incorrectly positioned scalp intravenous catheter in the subdural space. In general, the use of scalp veins for intravenous access is a common method for direct administration of medications and fluids in small infants, with risks that are comparable to those associated with peripheral venous access. The use of scalp intravenous catheters is a fairly safe practice when correctly positioned. Position confirmation before and during use is vital to avoid potential intracranial complications.",

    "abstract": "With the 2015 issues of Advances in Neonatal Care (ANC), we are celebrating our 15th year of scholarly dissemination about the care of neonates. In anticipation of this celebratory year, we worked with the ANC Editorial Board to evaluate how we could increase the readability and usability of our journal content for our readers. After thoughtful deliberation, we have made some changes in the journal layout and content focus. We want to take this opportunity to highlight some of these changes for you. In addition, as you interact with the journal throughout 2015, we welcome feedback regarding the changes in the journal as well as suggestions for additional improvements. CHANGES IN 2015 One of the first changes you will notice is the anniversary logo on the cover of each journal issue for 2015. As the year progresses, we will have a variety of opportunities to celebrate our 15 years as the journal for the National Association of Neonatal Nurses. We also have restructured the sections of the journal. The sections will now include the following: Case of the Month (Section Editor: Elizabeth Schierholz, MSN, RN, NNP-BC). “Case of the Month” manuscripts may include a presentation of a unique clinical case, an atypical presentation or outcome of a common disease, a case with a diagnostic challenge, an unusual disease process, or a challenging transport case. Clinical Issues in Neonatal Care (Section Editors: Ksenia Zukowsky, PhD, APRN, NNP-BC, and Linda Ikuta, MN, RN, CCNS). Manuscripts submitted for this section contain information that is fundamental to neonatal nursing practice. The reader will gain knowledge from the article that enriches and expands clinical knowledge and practice. Ethical Issues in Neonatal Care (Section Editor: Anita Catlin, DNSc, FNP, FAAN). The ethics section highlights dilemmas healthcare providers face in the care of the neonate. Submissions for this section could include management of difficult cases or family issues as well as end of life and defining life and decisions about whether to continue care discussions. Dr Catlin is very willing to mentor authors submitting their work for this section of the journal. Evidence-Based Practice Briefs (Section Editor: Sheila M. Gephart, PhD, RN). This section of the journal provides brief overviews of the evidence to support common care practice for neonates or their families. Briefs often address “why we do it this way” or issues of care protocols or routine practices that are or could be more grounded in evidence. Just because there is little or no evidence for a neonatal care practice does not mean it would not be an interesting submission for this section. Original Research (Section Editor: Donna Dowling, PhD, RN). Original completed research with neonatal populations and their families are welcomed for this section. Outcomes of Neonatal Care (Section Editor: Paula L. Forsythe, MSN, RN, CNS). This section of the journal focuses on newborn outcomes following admission to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and preparation of infants and their families as they transition from the NICU or step-down unit to home. The family teaching toolkits will continue to be an aspect of this section of the journal. Professional Growth and Development (Section Editor: Kathy Ahern, PhD, RN). The focus of this section is to provide information on topics that promote the growth and development of a wide range of neonatal healthcare professionals, including students, staff nurses, educators, managers, and practice specialists in neonatal care. Regardless of the section in which a manuscript is published, you will find a Summary box that highlights recommendations for practice and research at the end of each manuscript. All of the changes in the content and format of manuscripts are included in our newly revised author guidelines. The new guidelines are posted on our Web site and include specific information regarding the content of the new summary boxes as well as differences in formatting manuscripts depending on the journal section targeted for the publication. Finally, the ANC Editorial Board is willing to mentor new authors in writing their first manuscript, so feel free to let us know if you need assistance. HYBRID MODEL OF OPEN ACCESS In addition to our other changes, ANC will also become a hybrid open access journal. Open-access journals provide free, immediate, permanent, full-text open access to any individual who has access to the Internet, worldwide. Open-access journals primarily disseminate research articles in peer-reviewed journals. Journals with a hybrid model of open access have a combination of open access and subscription articles. In the ANC hybrid mode, authors will have the opportunity to retain copyright of any research article and pay a processing charge for immediate online accessibility of research articles. For researchers, this open-access opportunity allows them to disseminate their research findings faster and to a broader audience. Over the last decade, the move to open-access journals was met with both supporters and detractors. Supporters argue that open access to manuscripts creates a level playing field between those who “have” and “have not.” Low-resource institutions and countries cannot afford the subscription fees for most print journals, but with open access, anyone can access the information free of charge. Detractors argue that the processing fee required to ensure immediate free online access can lead to a pay-to-publish mentality. However, open access need not lead to less scientific rigor or a “watered down” peer-review process. At ANC, we want to assure our readers that we will maintain a rigorous peer-review process for all articles, regardless of open-access status. Authors will not be offered the opportunity for open access—and therefore we will be unaware of their wishes during the peer-review process—until after an article is accepted for publication. ANC will continue to provide high-quality manuscripts to our readers. However, we also want to make all of our readers aware of the presence of open access “predatory journals.” Although many fully open access journals are reputable, others seek to lure authors to publish in their journals just to obtain the publishing fees. Predatory journals have titles that appear reputable as they mimic the names of well-known journals. The predatory journals often have editorial boards composed of individuals who are unaware of their board status and the reported peer review is typically absent or minimal. For more information about open access and predatory journals, we encourage you to visit Dr Jeffrey Beall's Web site at http://scholarlyoa.com/publishers/. During 2015, we will continue our editorial series on writing for publication. We hope you continue to find our editorials informative and we hope you feel open to share your views with both your journal editors and editorial board. Thank you for your continued support!

    "abstract": "Dear NANN Colleagues, Please take a few moments to reflect on these questions: As you flip through the pages in a journal, what makes you stop and read an article? Do you stop because of the title or authors? Do you stop because the topic is one that you have recently seen in your clinical practice? Or, do you stop because the pictures, figures, tables, and graphs catch your eye? Depending on your purpose for paging through the latest issue of Advances in Neonatal Care (ANC), your answer could be all of these reasons. However, for the purposes of this editorial, we believe that most often the reason you stop to read an article is the figures, tables, or graphs that caught your eye. We purposely used a bulleted list at the beginning of this editorial to make the questions standout—again to catch your eye as you glance through the pages. Using different type styles such as bulleted lists, bolding, or italics can make your words stand out. However, boxes, tables, and figures are even more powerful communication tools that attract and sustain the interest of readers. Choosing to use these items in your manuscript does not need to be difficult; be fearless and creative in the process. Page through this edition of ANC and take a few moments to look at the figures, tables, and graphs in each of the articles. What do you see that you like? Which ones make you stop and take a second look? What would you do differently if you had been the author? We will direct you to some examples within this issue as we discuss each of the different types of visual images used to support your manuscript content. Pictures are often noted to \"say a thousand words,\" and so it is with images added to enhance the content in articles. We wrote this editorial to answer the questions we often have as we edit manuscripts for ANC. We also address areas where we most often need revisions in the submission of pictures, figures, tables, and graphs. While much of the information included in this editorial is reflected in the ANC author guidelines,1 we felt an editorial focused on these essential and visually appealing items within a manuscript would be important and helpful to many of our readers and authors. Even authors with excellent writing expertise often struggle with how and when to use these items to accentuate the significance of the work or data. Using images needs to be thought of as essential, not additive, because they make what we read really stick with us and increase our learning of the topic.2 Writing in academic programs does not always provide a foundation for knowing how and when to best use pictures and/or creating figures, tables, and graphs to enhance the content of the text in a published article. Students are not typically required to add these materials to their classroom work. Many times we receive a well written clinical manuscript submitted with no pictures, tables, figures, or graphs, and consequently, our reviewers critique it as a student paper. This may or may not be the case, but the reviewer critiques often suggest where the text could be decreased with a table or box and how a figure of the relationships described could enhance the manuscript. Furthermore, figures, tables, and graphs often give a manuscript a more professional feel.3 Most often when we request the addition of these items during the publication process, authors struggle with these requests. We hope the questions and answers addressed in this editorial will help you understand when and how to best use pictures, figures, tables, and graphs to enhance your work. WHY SHOULD YOU ADD PICTURES OR FIGURES? Most people are visual learners as opposed to auditory learners. Advances in Neonatal Care is, for the most part, not an auditory learning experience, unless of course you read your journal out loud. Thus, adding images such as pictures and figures can enhance visual learning, reinforcing a point by providing a visual perspective of the content found in the text. Pictures or figures also can demonstrate relationships between variables or concepts more clearly than text alone. Descriptions of relationships can easily become long and confusing to readers. Thus, creating a figure or using a picture can help readers better understand complex concepts and relationships. Images created to enhance the text within a manuscript should not repeat everything that is in the text and vice versa. Figures, graphs, and tables should draw attention to significant findings or relationships and key points, but they should not wholly repeat everything that is already detailed in the text. On a side note, there are ways to add auditory pieces to enhance your work. Please see our author guidelines for methods authors can use to add auditory and video content to manuscripts. We would really like to see more of this type of content in the future. If you need help with these manuscript features, just let us know. WHAT ARE GOOD PRACTICES FOR INCLUDING PICTURES AND FIGURES? Pictures of infants and families require permission for use, even for educational purposes. Families will often give consent when they understand that the image will be used to help others better care for infants in the future. Consent should be signed at the time the photo is taken, so parents do not feel their child is being \"used\" for our purposes. Figure 4 in the article by Siewert et al4 in this issue is a good example of a high quality photo that has been used to enhance the content of the article. If a hospital consent form is used, please make sure the language is broad enough to cover the usage of the photo in an educational publication such as ANC. If pictures are not available, there are also freely available (royalty free) stock photos and artwork on the Internet that can be used to enhance your manuscript, but please be careful to check to make sure the copyright protection covers use in an educational journal. If you do choose to use pictures you have taken or from the internet please make sure they are the appropriate pixels for them to print clearly in the journal. Poor quality pictures can actually detract from the work, so this is an important issue to consider. Pictures found in other books and journals can also be used to enhance your work, but permission from the copyright holder (usually the publisher) will be required and must be secured by the author before the manuscript can be accepted for publication. Even if the picture is a reprint from another publication, quality of the artwork must also be considered; please see our author guidelines for more details about picture quality.1 As is true for most journals, ANC cannot absorb the costs of the use of previously published work; however, it is important to note that the costs are usually minimal or may not exist at all, depending on the source of the artwork. Photos used in ANC must meet standards for developmentally appropriate care, including appropriate resting position, lighting, devices to support care, and positioning for feeding or procedures. Photos must also depict safe environments for infants. For example, a more mature stable infant shown in a crib should not be positioned prone, there should not be pillows or bumper pads, and crib rails should be up. In addition, all photos must show complete compliance with infection control standards for a neonatal intensive care unit setting: simple rings only, no bracelets, short natural nails, and full barrier precautions for any invasive procedures (sterile drapes, gowns, hats, masks, gloves). We evaluate historic photographs on their own merits, given the relevance to the manuscript context. Figures are often used to demonstrate trends, patterns, and relationships among concepts. Figures frequently provide a visual explanation of the sequence of events; for example, flow diagrams enhance understanding of caregiving protocols and bundles, especially when several decisions need to made along the way. For example, Figure 1 in the article by Siewert et al4 in this issue provides an easy to follow illustration of the sequence of the intervention sessions. Figures also can be used to describe sample selection in a research study or sample attrition that occurs after a sample has been recruited. Selection of colors and shapes is important and can make your figure either easier or more difficult to understand. A figure with lots of different shapes that are not meaningfully chosen can seem beautiful to you and too busy to a reader. Beware, and please have others look at your figure. Ask them to make sure they can easily understand the image without the supporting manuscript text. Figures should be able to stand alone. Figures are easily created in PowerPoint. Artwork generated from office suite programs such as CorelDRAW, MS Word, and Excel and artwork downloaded from the Internet (JPEG or GIF files) cannot be used because the quality is poor when printed. Creating and saving a figure in a single PowerPoint slide is best for uploading with your manuscript. If you are not comfortable creating your figure in this way, try to get some help from your institution. There are also tutorials available online for creating figures, such as http://xcorr.net/2010/06/19/video-tutorial-adobe-illustrator-for-scientists/. Or another place to check out is YouTube.com. There are several tutorials available through the site to help you with creation of illustrations for your manuscripts. Last but not least, our journal uses the American Medical Association (AMA) standards for publication, and they provide good examples for creating figures.5 All pictures and figures must be labeled with a title that describes the image. Titles should be short, clear, and informative. WHAT MAKES A GOOD TABLE? As with figures and images, tables can be used to enhance the text of your manuscript and should not be repetitive of content in the text or a figure or graph. Data presented in tables often allow for easier comparison of results rather than when presented in a long list of items and detailed in the manuscript. For example, each of the 4 tables found in the article by Vance et al6 in this issue provides clear concise information that adds to the content of the article. Please review these tables; the authors chose different styles to best highlight the data presented. There is no one style for a table, although there are recommended methods for presenting some statistical results (see the AMA guidelines for details about table styles). Tables need to be clear and concise, with well-labeled columns. However, too many columns or rows can detract from the clarity of your table, so think about what data are essential to present in your table. To increase clarity, present all data in a consistent fashion to minimize confusion for the reader. For example, you should portray all similar data in a table in the same format; do not use means with percentiles, but instead choose to use one or the other. Every table must have a title and must be referred to in the body of the manuscript. Tables must be numbered in order of appearance and should be included in separate Word files whenever possible, rather than in the same file as the manuscript. Putting all images (tables, figures, pictures, and graphs) in separate files makes formatting the files easier at later stages in the publication process. WHAT MAKES A GOOD GRAPH? Graphs are used to summarize research results or quality improvement findings when the general pattern of the findings is more important to increasing understanding than the exact data values. Most statistical software programs will create graphs upon request with statistical computations. Depending on the results, data can be depicted in several different formats, such as bar or line graphs, data plots, maps, and pie charts. Each format can be visualized in the statistical program, and the one that best depicts the data can be chosen to be included in your manuscript. An example of a well-designed bar graph is provided in the Figure in the article by Bosque7 in this issue. Well-designed examples of line graphs that show trends and patterns of feeding behaviors over time can be found in the article by Medoff-Cooper et al8 in this issue. Graphs can easily be created with data in PowerPoint, regardless of the statistics that have been obtained within other software. Graphs for ANC should be created in full color and should be well labeled on both the X and Y axes. Graphs also require short, clear, and informative titles, and finally, graphs need to be able to stand alone. Remember that some readers will look at your graphs, or even tables, without reading your manuscript, and they should be able to understand the image without having to search through the manuscript for more information. HOW MANY TABLES, FIGURES, AND GRAPHS SHOULD I ADD? It has been suggested that 1 picture, figure, table, or graph be used for every 1000 words in a manuscript,2 which translates to about 2 visual images for every 3 pages of print materials, given that about 750 words make up 1 page in ANC. We suggest you think about an image for every other print page, that way there is an image on each 2-page spread of the journal. Having an image breaks the text and briefly rests the brain. Moreover, during this pause, there is the opportunity for the materials from both the text and the image to be merged and absorbed comprehensively as a whole, furthering the learning of the material. As noted above, these images, when created properly, add to the understanding of the content in the manuscript. Images also make the journal pages visually appealing. Some journals limit the number of images (pictures, figures, tables, and graphs) submitted with a manuscript; at this point, ANC does not have a limit within our guidelines but we would recommend not exceeding 5 to 6. Additional images may be considered for supplemental digital content that will be available online only (see the ANC author guidelines1 for more details). SUMMARY Please do not be afraid of the writing process; we are here to help you through this journey. Please do add pictures, figures, tables, and graphs to your manuscript as appropriate for your topic. If you cannot find the right figure or picture to enhance your manuscript, please let us know in your cover letter so we can assist you in finding an appropriate image or so we can suggest something else that might work even better. If you share your questions about artwork we can work with you to produce the best manuscript for publication. Please refer often to our author guidelines during the writing process; details for using pictures, figures, tables, and graphs are outlined within the guideline. Finally, remember that ANC is a 4-color journal. We would like to use that feature to enhance your work, so submitting your pictures, figures, and graphs in full color is important. However, more importantly making sure you follow the guidelines about the quality of pictures is essential, so the images we use are clear and easy for our readership to understand. In the editorial process we will do everything we can to help you enhance your work and increase its scholarly application to improving neonatal care and outcomes. If you are a reviewer for ANC, the next time you are asked to review a manuscript, please consider the visual quality of the manuscript and make recommendations to improve the images and artwork. Help us and the authors to increase their creativity and enhance their work. We want ANC to be the best journal in neonatal care, with articles that help us to enhance our caregiving and patient outcomes. Thank you for your support! Jacqueline M.

    "abstract": "Background: Although opioids are effective for neonatal postoperative pain management, cumulative opioid exposure may be detrimental. Pain management practices vary among providers, but practice guidelines may promote consistency and decrease opioid use. Purpose: To develop a pain management guideline (PMG) for neonates undergoing minor surgical procedures with the overarching goal of reducing opioid use without compromising the pain experience. The specific aim was for neonatal intensive care unit providers to adhere to the PMG at least 50% of the time. Methods: An interdisciplinary pain and sedation work group in a large level IV neonatal intensive care unit developed an evidence-based PMG for minor surgical procedures. Nurses and providers were educated on the new guideline, and rapid cycle quality improvement methodology provided an opportunity to adjust interventions over 3 months. Results: The PMG was used for 32 neonates following minor surgical procedures: 18 (56%) of the neonates received only acetaminophen and no opioids, 32% required 0.15 mg/kg dose equivalent of morphine or less, and only 9% required more than 0.15 mg/kg dose equivalent of morphine. Overall, opioid use decreased by 88% compared with rates before implementation of the PMG. Providers adhered to the PMG approximately 83.3% of time. Implications for Practice: A PMG is a systematic approach to direct nurses and providers to appropriately assess, prevent, and treat neonatal pain following minor surgery while alleviating opioid overuse. Implications for Research: Future research should focus on determining and mitigating barriers to nurse/provider use of the PMG and developing and implementing a PMG for major surgical procedures.",

    "abstract": "Background: Parents in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) report low self-confidence managing their children's ongoing medical and social needs. While bedside nurses provide critical support for families throughout their NICU admission, there may be a role for nursing coordination throughout hospitalization, discharge, and in the transition to outpatient care. Purpose: This program evaluation explores parent and provider experiences of a novel longitudinal care coordination program for infants with medical complexity from the NICU through their first year of life post-discharge. Methods: First, a sequential exploratory mixed-methods approach was used to evaluate parental experiences (n = 5 interviewed followed by n = 23 surveyed). Provider perspectives were elicited through semi-structured interviews (n = 8) and focus groups (n = 26 in 3 groups). Results: Parent-reported benefits included frequent communication and personalized support that met families' and patients' evolving needs. Care coordinators, who were trained as nurses and social workers, developed longitudinal relationships with parents. This seemed to facilitate individualized support throughout the first year of life. Providers reported that smaller caseloads were central to the success of the program. Implications for Practice and Research: This longitudinal care coordination program can be used as a translatable model in NICUs elsewhere to address the unique needs of families of infants with medical complexity throughout the first year of life. Future implementations should consider how to expand program size while maintaining individualized supports. As the care coordinators are former NICU nurses and social workers, there may be a growing role for nursing coordination of care in the neonatal population.",

    "abstract": "Background: Preterm infants have known impairments in language development relative to infants born at full term, and the language-poor environment of the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is a contributing factor. Adapting outpatient literacy programs for the NICU is a potential evidence-based intervention to encourage adult speech exposure to infants through reading sessions during NICU hospitalization. Purpose: To evaluate implementation of a 10-day NICU Read-a-Thon and potential barriers and facilitators of a year-round program aimed at increasing reading sessions for NICU patients. Methods: We established an implementation team to execute a Read-a-Thon and evaluated its impact utilizing quantitative and qualitative approaches. Quantitative methodology was used to report number of donated books and infant reading sessions. Qualitative methodology inclusive of interviews, surveys, and source document reviews was used to evaluate the Read-a-Thon. Results: We received approximately 1300 donated books and logged 663 reading sessions over the 10-day Read-a-Thon. Qualitative evaluation of the Read-a-Thon identified 6 main themes: motivation, emotional response to the program, benefits and outcomes, barriers, facilitators, and future of literacy promotion in our NICU. Our evaluation informed specific aims for improvement (eg, maintaining book accessibility) for a quality improvement initiative to sustain a year-round reading program. Implications for Practice and Research: Neonatal units can leverage Read-a-Thons as small tests of change to evaluate barriers, facilitators, and change processes needed to implement reading programs. Process maps of book inventory and conducting a 5 W's, 2 H's (who, what, when, where, why, how, how much) assessment can aid in program planning.",

One common neonatal skin issue is diaper dermatitis (DD). DD treatment and prevention guidelines often lack the inclusion of topical human milk as a viable option. Purpose: To analyze the safety and efficacy of topical human milk application as a means to support future research of human milk as a topical treatment for DD. Data Sources: Google Scholar, CINAHL, PubMed, and Cochrane. Study Selection: The search was limited to articles published between 2011 and 2023 in the English language. Disqualifying characteristics included nonhuman subjects, literature reviews, inability to obtain articles, and non–peer-reviewed articles. Data Extraction: For Google Scholar, the search terms “human milk OR breast milk” and “topical” were used. For CINAHL, PubMed, and Cochrane, the search terms “human milk OR chest milk OR breast milk OR donor milk” and “topical” were used. Quantitative significance was defined by a P value of less than .05. Results: The search yielded 20 articles. The results of the review demonstrate that topical human milk application is a safe and effective topical treatment to skin integrity/inflammatory issues such as DD. It also identified that caregivers will likely show positive regard to the treatment, promoting its acceptance. Implications for Practice and Research: The results provide evidence to support methodologic development for human milk application for the prevention and treatment of DD. Further studies can use the results to develop protocols that investigate the effects of human milk application.",

    "abstract": "Background: Skin-to-skin contact (SSC) is widely implemented in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) due to its established role in reducing mortality and morbidity. However, the impact of SSC on diaphragmatic electrical activity (Edi) in premature infants undergoing noninvasive pressure control (NIV-PC) for respiratory management remains insufficiently explored. Purpose: To assess the effects of SSC on Edi and vital signs in preterm infants managed with NIV-PC. Methods: A prospective, observational, crossover study was conducted, involving preterm infants admitted to a level III NICU between May 2020 and August 2021, who were receiving respiratory support with NIV-PC. Data were collected at 3 distinct time points: before SSC (pre-SSC period), during SSC (SSC period), and after SSC (post-SSC period). Thirty-minute periods of stable data were extracted for analysis. Results: A total of 21 SSC sessions were performed on 14 preterm infants, with a median age at the initiation of SSC of 62 days. The median (interquartile range) Edi peak (in microvolts) before, during, and after SSC was 7.1 (5.8-10.8), 6.8 (4.3-8.8), and 7.1 (5.5-8.8), respectively. No statistically significant differences were observed in Edi peak or minimum values during SSC, when compared with the periods before and after the SSC procedure. Likewise, no significant changes were noted in respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, heart rate, or the incidence of apnea. Implications for Practice and Research: SSC in preterm infants undergoing NIV-PC does not exacerbate their clinical condition. Further investigations involving diverse patient cohorts are warranted.",

Our team adapted and implemented this approach in a Ugandan unit for hospitalized neonates. Purpose: This qualitative descriptive study examined the perceptions of mothers and healthcare professionals (HCPs) of the benefits and challenges of this new approach to care. Methods: Fifty-one mothers of hospitalized neonates born weighing greater than 2000 g participated in the program. They were taught to assess neonate danger signs, feeding, and weight. After discharge, a subsample (n = 15) participated in focus groups to explore benefits and challenges of their participation in care. Interviews with 8 HCPs were also conducted for the same purpose. Transcripts from focus groups and interviews were analyzed using inductive content analysis to describe the benefits and challenges from the perspectives of mothers and HCPs. Results: For mothers a benefit was decreased stress. Both mothers and HCPs reported that the knowledge and skills mothers acquired were a benefit as was their ability to apply these to the care of their neonate. Improved relations between mothers and HCPs were described, characterized by greater exchange of information and HCPs’ attentiveness to mothers’ assessments. Mothers felt ready for discharge and used their knowledge at home. HCPs noted a decrease in their workload. Challenges included the need for mothers to overcome fears about performing the tasks, their own well-being and literacy skills, and access to equipment. Implications for Practice: Mothers’ participation in their neonates’ care can have benefits for them and their neonate.",

Despite emerging evidence highlighting the importance of paternal bonding, little attention has been focused on fathers. Simultaneously, there is little clarity regarding possible differences between bonding and attachment. Purpose: This article aims to clarify the concept of paternal bonding with infants born prematurely. Methods/Search Strategy: Using Walker and Avant’s approach to concept analysis, we selected databases and searched them for relevant studies published between 2012 and 2022. We identified 28 articles that (1) defined bonding specific to fathers of infants born prematurely, (2) were peer-reviewed, and (3) were in English. From the articles, we extracted and analyzed data specific to concept definitions, antecedents, and consequences. Results: Regarding paternal bonding with infants born prematurely, our analyses of the 28 studies yielded a conceptual definition of this topic that extends beyond the commonly used definition emphasizing emotional connection. The newly formulated definition covers the cognitive, behavioral, and dynamic, as well as emotional, attributes of bonding. We identify and discuss antecedents and consequences of bonding. Implications for Practice and Research: Our findings led to a consistent conceptual definition of the bonding phenomenon in question. The definition should serve as a conceptual basis for future guidelines governing clinical practice and research. Through our findings, nurses can better understand and promote paternal bonding with infants born prematurely. Finally, our findings can improve researchers’ exploration of this topic.",

The Stollery Children’s Hospital neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) expanded their TNE training program to include neonatal nurse practitioners (NNPs), the first in North America. Purpose: This study examines the thoughts and perceptions of clinicians about the incorporation of NNPs providing TNE and hemodynamic consultation and investigates key facilitators and challenges for consideration when planning future training, expansion of service in Edmonton, or beyond. Methods: In this descriptive study using qualitative methodology, purposive sampling was used to invite NICU clinicians to participate. Using a semistructured topic guide, a focus group and 2 individual interviews were conducted. Results: Participants were supportive of NNPs. Advantages included increased access to service, acquisition and retention of skills, provision of patient-centered care, and leveraged interpersonal relationships in the decision-making process. Key aspects of program expansion included climate and culture of the NICU, presence of adequate patient volume, and resources to support training. Implications for Practice and Research: Support across disciplines and the collaborative working nature of the NICU are key factors in the success of the program’s development and implementation. Benefits of having NNPs on the TNE team were clearly expressed. Benefits to the health system included rapid access to hemodynamic information allowing for care based on specific pathophysiology and additional local capacity to perform TNE and reducing demand on other trained providers. Additional research could consider parental views of NNPs performing TNE and hemodynamic consultation as well as the accuracy of diagnosis between the NNPs and physician group.",

However, a lack of appropriately translated research study materials may limit the opportunity for these families to be involved in research that could impact the care that infants and families receive in the NICU. Purpose: The primary purpose was to pilot test study materials that were transcreated from English to Spanish with the assistance of a bilingual community advisory board with Spanish-speaking parents of NICU infants. Methods: A total of 19 Spanish-speaking parents (15 mothers and 4 fathers) who were representative of the population of interest completed paper-and-pencil surveys, along with a cognitive interview. Preliminary data related to decision-making and goals of care, infant symptoms, and their experiences in the NICU were also collected. Results: The internal reliability of the transcreated study instruments ranged from good to excellent (α= 0.82-0.99). Participants reported that study materials were not offensive and did not make them feel uncomfortable; however, they found some words/phrases to be confusing. Parents had the opportunity to provide suggested wording changes. Implications for Practice and Research: Language barriers and a lack of cultural responsiveness can affect the care that infants and their families receive. More accurate and culturally appropriate transcreation of study materials can remove barriers to research participation and facilitate better communication with non-English-speaking families, which may lead to the development of better-informed evidence-based interventions and clinical practices in the NICU.",

While white noise has been used for postoperative pain relief in infants, its effects on neonates after surgery need further exploration. Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of white noise on pain scores and salivary cortisol levels in surgical neonates. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 64 neonates scheduled for surgery were recruited and assigned by block randomization into 2 groups. The intervention group listened to white noise at 50 dB, while the control group listened to white noise at 0 dB, for 30 minutes 6 times for 48 hours postoperatively. Pain scores, measured by the COMFORTneo Scale, and salivary cortisol levels were compared. Results: Although pain scores decreased after surgery in all subjects, no statistically significant difference was observed between the 2 groups ( P = .937). There was a significant difference between pre- and postintervention pain scores in the intervention group only ( P = .006). Salivary cortisol levels decreased after intervention in the intervention group, but there was no significant difference between pre- and postintervention levels in the 2 groups ( P = .716). Implications for Practice: Given the reduction in pain scores and salivary cortisol concentrations after white noise intervention, white noise shows potential as an adjunctive soothing measure for neonates after surgery. Implications for Research: Future studies are needed to confirm the efficacy and utility of white noise intervention in clinical settings.",

Abdominal massage for hyperbilirubinemia is considered a safe complementary treatment for infants that may increase number of defecations and decrease bilirubin levels. Purpose: This study was designed as a randomized controlled trial to determine the effect of abdominal massage on bilirubin levels in term infants receiving phototherapy. Methods: The sample consisted of 43 term newborns (intervention group: 23; control group: 20) who received phototherapy in a university hospital between June 2019 and February 2021. Information and observation forms were used for data collection. The intervention group received 6 abdominal massages over 2 days, performed 3 times a day, 6 hours apart, and lasting 5 minutes each. Results: Transcutaneous bilirubin levels and heart rate were significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group at 48 hours ( P = .015 and P = .033, respectively). Number of defecations was higher in the intervention group at 24 hours ( P = .007) but there was no significant difference at 48 hours. The decrease in serum bilirubin between 24 and 48 hours was significantly greater in the intervention group ( P = .005). Implication for Practice and Research: Abdominal massage was effective in reducing bilirubin levels and may increase the number of defecations. Providing massage training to the parents of infants who are discharged early could be a protective approach to prevent the rise in bilirubin levels.",

    "abstract": "Background: An estimated 25,000 infants are born to mothers diagnosed with hepatitis B virus (HBV) each year in the United States. Administration of the birth dose HBV vaccine prevents transmission during delivery. Despite national guidelines promoting vaccination within 24 hours of birth, fewer than 70% of infants receive the dose in their first 3 days of life. To improve compliance with national recommendations, Northwestern Medicine implemented a bundled care initiative in the well newborn nursery, entitled the 24-hour baby bundle (24-HBB). Purpose: Evaluate the 24-HBB’s effect on improving time to HBV vaccine administration. Methods: The 24-HBB was created by an interdisciplinary team and implemented on February 17, 2020. Bundled care begins at 23 hours of life, starting with the HBV vaccine, followed by bath, weight, and congenital heart disease screening, and ending with metabolic screening. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 22,057 infants born at Northwestern Medicine Prentice Women’s Hospital in Chicago, Illinois. Our sample included preintervention birthdates between February 16, 2019, and January 16, 2020, and postintervention birthdates between March 17, 2020, and February 16, 2021, with a 2-month washout education period between January 17, 2020, and March 16, 2020. Results: Hepatitis B virus immunization within 24 hours increased significantly from 43.83% to 66.90% ( P &lt; .0001). In addition, overall hepatitis B immunization prior to discharge significantly increased after implementation of the 24-HBB (98.18% vs 98.82%, P &lt; .0001). Implications for Practice and Research: The 24-HBB is effective at increasing rates of HBV immunization within 24 hours of birth. Newborn nurseries may benefit from similar initiatives to prevent hepatitis B infection, satisfy national recommendations, and promote childhood vaccination compliance.",

    "abstract": "Background: Preterm infants require the use of nasogastric and orogastric enteral access devices (EADs) to provide nutrition and medications. Confirmation of the location of the tip of the EAD is essential to minimize complications. At the study site, EAD location was limited to verifying the centimeter marking at the lip/nares and nonevidence-based methods of visual observation of aspirate and auscultation. Purpose: Implement an evidenced-based EAD placement confirmation protocol, and by 90 days post-education and implementation, achieve adherence of 90%. Methods: This quality improvement project implemented a nurse-driven evidence-based protocol for EAD verification. The intervention was based on the New Opportunities for Verification of Enteral Tube Location best practice recommendations. Prior to implementation, education sessions focused on insertion measurement technique and gastric pH measurement. Radiographs, insertion measurement technique, centimeter marking, and gastric pH measurement were used for EAD location confirmation. To determine compliance with the protocol, audits were conducted and questionnaires assessing current practice regarding EAD confirmation were administered pre- and postimplementation. Results: The protocol increased nursing knowledge regarding evidence-based EAD insertion and verification procedures, incorporated pH measurement into practice, and reduced use of auscultation for confirmation. Nursing adherence to the protocol was 92%. Implications for Practice and Research: This provides a model for how to successfully implement and achieve adherence to an evidence-based EAD placement confirmation nurse-driven protocol. Further research is needed to verify the effectiveness of the protocol and establish consensus on approaches specifically for the neonatal population.

    "abstract": "Background: Enteral feeding by a transpyloric tube in critically ill infants is indicated when there is a failure in gastric feeding. However, there is a wide variability regarding the insertion technique. Purpose: To perform a systematic review of the methods for inserting a transpyloric feeding tube in newborns and infants. Data Sources: Nine databases, without date or language restrictions, accessed in September 2021. Study Selection: A systematic review of experimental and nonexperimental studies, according to the “Patient/problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome” strategy and the “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses” guidelines. The clinical question was about the measurement and insertion techniques, as well as the success rates of properly placing a transpyloric tube in newborns and infants. Data Extraction: Two authors (N.M.Q. and J.F.S.) analyzed 6 observational descriptive prospective studies, all of them published in peer-reviewed indexed medical journals and one in the official journal of the National Association of Neonatal Nurses. Results: The success rate varied between 70% and 100%. There was an important variability in the type of tube, measurement method, and insertion techniques. It was found that the most common strategies to achieve proper positioning were glabella-calcaneal measurements, gastric air insufflation, and right lateral decubitus. Implications for Practice: A transpyloric catheter insertion protocol needs to be established in each neonatal unit, according to the literature findings. Implications for Research: Randomized controlled studies that evaluate the gastric air insufflation technique and other adjuvant measures could elucidate the knowledge gap concerning the correct positioning of transpyloric tubing in newborns and infants.",

Purpose: To assess the effect of oral colostrum application on the condition of the mouth and the incidence of late-onset sepsis (LOS) among premature infants. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, 70 newborn premature infants were randomly allocated to colostrum or sterile water groups. The Mouth Care Assessment Tool was used to evaluate the condition of the mouth for 5 days after oral colostrum application. The incidence of LOS was measured using clinical and laboratory indicators from 72 hours after birth until discharge. Results: The condition of the mouth was significantly different on days 4 and 5, demonstrating that the colostrum group had less need for oral care ( P &lt; .001) compared to the control group. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in clinical symptoms and laboratory values related to LOS ( P &gt; .05). Implications for practice: Oral colostrum application can benefit oral mucosal health and reduce the need for oral care among premature infants. It is also safe alternative oral care for premature infants who cannot breastfeed during the first few days of life. Future research should include infants of different gestational ages and mechanically ventilated infants to assess the effect of oral colostrum application on serum immune factors.",

Management of endotracheal tubes (ETTs) can be particularly challenging in neonates due to the unique needs and physical characteristics of this patient population. Purpose: The purpose of this quality improvement project was to decrease the rate of UEs from 0.76 to less than 0.5 per 100 ventilator days in an urban level III NICU in the Midwest, United States. Methods: A newly formed interprofessional team created an evidence-based, standardized, bedside nurse-led care bundle for intubations and ETT care in the NICU. This project also created standardized, clear, closed-loop communication for the transition of bedside staff at shift change. Results: The UE rate decreased from 0.76 to 0 per 100 ventilator days, reaching the goal of less than 0.5 per 100 ventilator days, during the 10-week project implementation period from December 2021 to February 2022. Implications for Practice and Research: Many NICUs focus on reducing UEs due to the impact on healthcare resource utilization, acute complications, and long-term outcomes for infants. The development of a standardized, nurse-led care bundle for ETTs decreased the rate of UEs. Future research is needed to study the potential for generalization to different units and beyond the scope of the neonatal population.",

    "abstract": "Background: Using Artificial Intelligence (AI) for neonatal pain assessment has great potential, but its effectiveness depends on accurate data labeling. Therefore, precise and reliable neonatal pain datasets are essential for managing neonatal pain. Purpose: To develop and validate a comprehensive multimodal dataset with accurately labeled clinical data, enhancing AI algorithms for neonatal pain assessment Methods: An assessment team randomly selected healthy neonates for assessment using the Neonatal Pain, Agitation, and Sedation Scale. During painful procedures, 2 cameras recorded neonates’ pain reactions on site. After 2 weeks, assessors labeled the processed pain data on the EasyDL platform in a single-anonymized setting. The pain scores from the 4 single-modal data types were compared to the total pain scores derived from multimodal data. The On-Site Neonatal Pain Assessment completed using paper quality scales is referred to as OS-NPA, while the modality-data neonatal pain labeling performed using labeling software is MD-NPL. Results: The intraclass correlation coefficient among the 4 single-modal groups ranged from 0.938 to 0.969. The overall pain intraclass correlation coefficient score was 0.99, with a Kappa statistic for pain grade agreement of 0.899. The goodness-of-fit for the linear regression models comparing the OS-NPA and MD-NPL for each assessor was greater than 0.96. Implications for Practice and Research: MD-NPL represents a productive alternative to OS-NPA for neonatal pain assessment, and the validity of the data labels within the Multimodality Dataset for Neonatal Acute Pain has been validating. These findings offer reliable validation for algorithms designed to assess neonatal pain.",

Staff may hesitate to initiate early SSC, the first or second week of life, for the most extremely preterm infants; 1 reason could be nurses’ attitudes. Purpose: The aim was to investigate the attitudes and experiences of neonatal nurses regarding early SSC for the most extremely preterm infants, born at gestational week (GW) 22-23, using an exploratory and descriptive approach. Methods: A web-based survey was sent to all nurses across the 6 Swedish units routinely caring for the most extremely preterm infants. Descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis were used to analyze the data. Results: The response rate was 258 out of 547 (47%). This study reveals a spectrum of attitudes and experiences among nurses, ranging from viewing early SSC as an integral aspect of infant care to deeming it very challenging or simply not feasible. The outcomes are presented in 2 categories, describing both facilitators and challenges associated with early SSC. Noteworthy, facilitators include well-implemented guidelines that support early SSC. Conversely, challenges encompass knowledge gaps and the scarcity of scientific evidence demonstrating the safety of all SSC, including early, for the most extremely preterm infants. Implications for practice and research: This study underscores the importance of spreading knowledge, and has clinical adapted guidelines about the practical aspects of SSC for infants born at 22-23 GW. Future research is required to clarify safety aspects pertaining to SSC for the most extremely preterm infants.",

    "abstract": "Neonatal advanced practice providers (APPs) often work prolonged hours in high-acuity neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). It is imperative to understand how fatigue affects the APP's ability to react quickly following long shifts. There is a lack of data on the effects of shift length and fatigue on neonatal APP job performance and clinical decision-making. The purpose of this study was to describe the variation in shift length, knowledge-based competency, personal well-being, and behavioral alertness for neonatal APPs. This study evaluated neonatal APPs before and after a clinical shift. Provider well-being was assessed during the pre-survey. Pretest-posttest surveys evaluated neonatal APP's psychomotor vigilance skills and knowledge. Participants completed an online, anonymous questionnaire to answer a series of knowledge-based questions before and after their shift, along with a psychomotor vigilance test (PVT). A paired t test analysis evaluated the pre- and post-shift PVT values and knowledge-based test scores. Overall, 61 pre-surveys and 42 post-surveys were completed; 36 were matched by participants pre- to post-survey. The mean between pre- and post-knowledge-based questions was statistically significant, with higher posttest scores. There was no statistical difference noted in the paired t test analysis of the PVT values. The small sample size may limit the generalizability of findings, but these results may indicate that shift length does not affect psychomotor vigilance or knowledge-based competency. It is vital that future work assess the associations between APP shift length, fatigue, and critical decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Postoperative pain management in the neonatal period is an area of high variability and a source of staff dissatisfaction. Pain management is a key component of high-quality care; however, pain assessment in infants is difficult and analgesics can negatively impact the developing brain. We aimed to improve postoperative pain control for infants in our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), limit variability in the approach to pain management, and increase staff satisfaction. This project was completed between April 2019 and March 2022 with sustainment tracked through December 2023. Interventions took place in a 70-bed level IV NICU using quality improvement methodology. Interventions included efforts aimed at improving pain assessment as well as development and implementation of a pain management guideline. Outcome measures included frequency of uncontrolled postoperative pain and measures of staff satisfaction. Process measures included compliance with pain assessment cadence and guideline recommendations. Opioid exposure within 24 hours of surgery was included as a balancing measure. Pain management was assessed in 811 infants: 392 prior to guideline implementation, 273 during implementation, and 146 during sustainment period. Uncontrolled postoperative pain decreased from 26% pre-implementation to 18% post implementation and into the sustainment period. Staff satisfaction improved from 67% to 83%. These improvements were associated with decreased variability in postoperative pain management and a decrease in postoperative opioid exposure. The use of a postoperative pain management guideline can improve pain control, decrease drug regimen variability, decrease opioid exposure, and increase staff satisfaction.",

    "abstract": "Background: Neonatal appendicitis (NA) is a rare condition with an estimated incidence of 0.04% to 0.2%. It is more prevalent in male preterm infants, with a mortality rate of 20% to 25%. It is usually misdiagnosed as neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) owing to its diverse diagnostic challenges. Poor perfusion, hypoxia, anemia, or any other condition that impairs intestinal blood supply is a risk factor for bowel injury, which could explain the physiopathology of NA. Clinical Findings: We describe an interesting case of a preterm infant with recurrent episodes of abdominal distension and persistent anemia who was finally diagnosed with NA. Primary Diagnosis: The patient was treated with exploratory laparotomy and appendicectomy, with further symptom resolution. The diagnosis was confirmed by pathological examination. Interventions: Surgery for acute abdomen secondary to perforated appendicitis. Outcomes: Improved recurrent abdominal distension and persistent anemia and achieved full enteral nutrition. Patients with other diseases such as Hirschsprung’s disease were ruled out. Practice Recommendations: This case demonstrates that identifying the early signs and symptoms of NA requires a high index of suspicion. Anemia may play a significant role in the etiology of intestinal injury, increasing the risk of NA and NEC. Further studies are needed to explore the association between anemia and intestinal injury and its implications for neurodevelopment.",

    "abstract": "The use of a single dose of antenatal steroids to facilitate fetal lung maturation in the expectant management of threatened preterm birth has significantly improved the mortality and morbidity of premature infants worldwide. In some settings, the evidence for this practice has been extrapolated with self-reports of up to 6 repeated courses during the antepartum period. Concerns about the use of repeated antenatal courses prompted the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to publish a consensus statement (2000) that reaffirmed the safety and efficacy of a single course of antenatal steroids, but emphasized that there are no data to support the safety and efficacy of repeated courses. The statement cautions against the use of multiple courses outside of research protocols. Despite these recommendations, wide variations in clinical practice continue to exist. There are growing concerns about the potential deleterious effects of steroid exposure on the developing human brain. It is plausible, although not proven, that negative neurodevelopmental impact may occur, or be compounded by multiple antenatal or combined antenatal and postnatal steroid exposures. This article provides a review of the evidence to support appropriate steroid use. The physiology and pharmacology of both endogenous and exogenous steroids are outlined to enhance the clinician's understanding of these potent agents. Recommendations for targeted clinical evaluation and short- and long-term follow-up of steroid exposed infants are provided. A clear understanding of the known and potential risks and benefits of single and multiple courses of antenatal steroids is essential to prompt a critical re-examination of the safety and efficacy of repeated steroid exposure in the neonate.",

    "abstract": "Preterm infants routinely require enteral feeding via nasogastric or orogastric tubes as an alternative to oral feeding to meet their nutritional needs. Anecdotal evidence suggests variations in practice related to correct tube placement and assessment of feed intolerance.To determine the current practices of enteral feeding tube placement confirmation and gastric residual (GR) aspiration of neonatal clinicians in Australia.A cross-sectional online survey comprising 24 questions was distributed to nursing and medical health professionals working in Australian neonatal care units through 2 e-mail listservs made available by professional organizations.The survey was completed by 129 clinicians. A single method was practiced by 50% of the clinicians in confirming tube placement, and most common practice was assessing the pH of GR aspirate. The majority of respondents (96%) reported that they relied on GR aspiration and clinical signs to determine feeding tolerance and subsequent decisions such as ceasing or decreasing feeds. However, the frequency of aspiration, the amount and color of aspirate considered to be normal/abnormal, and decisions on whether to replace gastric aspirate or whether aspiration should be performed during continuous tube feeding varied.This study demonstrated considerable variability in clinical practice for enteral feeding tube placement confirmation and GR aspiration despite most respondents reporting using a unit-based clinical practice guideline. Our study findings highlight the need for not only developing evidence-based practice guidelines for safe and consistent clinical practice but also ensuring that these guidelines are followed by all clinicians.Further research is needed to establish evidence-based methods both for enteral feeding tube placement confirmation and for the assessment of feeding intolerance during tube feeding. In addition, the reasons why evidence-based methods are not followed must be investigated.",

Purpose: To evaluate both perceived and biological measures of work-related stress in neonatal healthcare professionals and to compare professionals working in the NICU with their colleagues working in less critical environments (ie, neonatal wards [NWs]). Methods: The salivary cortisol level at the beginning (CORT-B) and at the end (CORT-E) of a daily work shift was collected once a week for 6 weeks and a psychological questionnaire was submitted to NW and NICU workers of a tertiary university center. Results: No differences emerged in the overall cortisol secretion between professionals (NW 45 vs NICU 28), but the decrease in the mean cortisol values between CORT-B and CORT-E was less pronounced in NICU professionals ( P &lt; .001) who had greater psychological stress ( P &lt; .001). Lack of correlation between perceived and biological indexes was observed. Implications for Practice: NICU professionals reported greater levels of self-perceived psychological stress, especially in terms of professional self-doubt and the complexity of interactions with infants and their parents. The disconnection between psychological and biological indexes raises the issue that work-related stress might be covert to the professionals themselves. Dedicated resources should be developed to address quality of life and the work environment of NICU professionals. Implications for Research: The absence of a correlation between perceived and biological indexes highlights the need to incorporate multidimensional physiological and biological measurements in evaluating burnout levels in neonatal healthcare providers.",

Yet, Hispanic and Black preterm infants are less likely than their White counterparts to receive MOM feedings. Evidence is lacking concerning potential modifiable factors and evidence-based strategies that predict provision of MOM among minority mothers of premature infants.A review of the literature was conducted to answer the clinical question: \"What evidence-based strategies encourage and improve mother's own milk expression in Black and Hispanic mothers of premature infants?\"Multiple databases including PubMed, Cochrane, and CINAHL were searched for articles published in the past 10 years (2010 through May 2020), reporting original research and available in English. Initial search yielded zero articles specifically addressing the impact of lactation interventions on MOM provision in minority mothers. Additional studies were included and reviewed if addressed breastfeeding facilitators and barriers (n = 3) and neonatal intensive care unit breastfeeding support practices (n = 7).Current strategies used to encourage and improve MOM expression in minority mothers are based on or extrapolated from successful strategies developed and tested in predominantly White mothers. However, limited evidence suggests that variation in neonatal intensive care unit breastfeeding support practices may explain (in part) variation in disparities and supports further research in this area.Neonatal intensive care unit staff should consider implementing scaled up or bundled strategies showing promise in improving MOM milk expression among minorities while taking into consideration the cultural and racial norms influencing breastfeeding decisions and practice.Experimental studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of targeted and culturally sensitive lactation support interventions in Hispanic and Black mothers.",

    "abstract": "Background: Escalating and aggressive visitor behaviors have become increasingly common in healthcare settings nationally, negatively impacting staff and patients alike. Most healthcare providers do not innately possess the specific skills to manage such behaviors. Management of escalating and aggressive behaviors presents a particularly bedeviling challenge when staff safety must be balanced with the needs of parent–neonate bonding. Purpose: In the Intensive Care Nursery (ICN), the frequency of aggressive and hostile incidents from visitors increased such that the staff felt frustrated by and uneasy about their work environment. Methods: The ICN convened an interprofessional team to strategize interventions aimed at consistently managing aggressive behavior and supporting the staff after aggressive and/or hostile visitor encounters. Findings: Following staff education and training, the unit launched a de-escalation management algorithm in July 2018 that assisted in identifying high-risk families at admission and drove consistent action and management of all visitor behaviors. In the 12 months following the intervention, the frequency of behavioral escalation decreased by 75% and staff perception of safety increased by 25%. Implications for Practice: Collaborating with staff to design consistent strategies to manage aggressive and escalating visitor behavior can improve safety and improve employee satisfaction in the ICN. Implications for Research: Additional research on the effectiveness of the algorithm in other ICNs and alternative areas of practice is needed. Furthermore, validation of a staff perception survey measuring the impact of escalating visitor behaviors on employees would be an important next step in this research.

New practice guidelines from 2016 promoted this practice for all neonates born at less than 32 weeks, but the authors' prior work indicated that all neonates born less than 1500 g were at risk (regardless of gestational age) and would benefit from these interventions.After the intervention, only 2.1% (n = 2) of neonates born less than 1500 g or at less than 32 weeks were admitted moderately hypothermic (<36°C) compared with 9.6% in 2016, 20.2% in 2015, and 32.4% in 2014. Overall, the mean admission temperature in 2017 was 37°C, improved from 36.6°C in 2016, 36.3°C in 2015, and 36.2°C in 2014 (P < .001).The intervention significantly reduced the number of neonates admitted moderately hypothermic (<36.0°C) to this neonatal intensive care unit. Using chemical mattresses and polyurethane bags with neonates born less than 1500 g or at less than 32 weeks (compared with only <1000 g) improved admission temperatures. It is important to include all neonates born less than 1500 g in these practice interventions and not only those born at less than 32 weeks; both gestational age and weight should guide practice.More research is needed on the effects of thermoregulation interventions and hyperthermia in neonates, as well as best practice thermoregulation interventions for preterm and ill neonates of all gestational ages and weights.",

For the first time in years, locum tenens neonatal APPs are not required. We have developed a \"tool kit\" of content, activities, exercises, and evaluations to support successful attainment of expected competencies.Future studies can measure retention, satisfaction, and clinical outcomes.A successful training program has been implemented to meet the growing demand.

Signs of peripheral ischemia were present in 36 of 105 cases (34%) when the PAL was removed but persisted in only 2 patients. UAC-associated persistent ischemic damage occurred in 2 of 97 patients.PALs are a valuable alternative to UACs even in preterm newborns below 26 weeks of gestational age.

    "abstract": "Background: A maternal diagnosis of chorioamnionitis, based on maternal peripartum fever of 100.4°F alone, is commonly used as an indication for blood work and antibiotic treatment in newborns. New strategies such as the Kaiser Permanente early-onset sepsis (EOS) calculator have proven effective in identifying high-risk newborns and reducing unnecessary antibiotic administration. Purpose: Retrospective data from October 2017 to September 2018 from 297 well-appearing newborns ≥35 weeks' gestational age (GA) with maternal chorioamnionitis showed that 93.6% had blood work and 90.2% were treated with antibiotics. This was despite no culture-positive cases of sepsis. Our aim was to reduce by 50% blood work evaluation and antibiotic treatment within a 6-month period. Methods: Using plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles, we adopted the Kaiser Permanente EOS calculator. We collected longitudinal data to track the outcomes after its implementation. Results: In 423 newborns with maternal chorioamnionitis triaged with the EOS calculator from October 2018 to July 2020, the rates of blood culture and antibiotic treatment decreased from 93.6% to 26.7% and 90.2% to 12.3% ( P &lt; .0001). In the larger population of 6426 newborns ≥35 weeks' GA, the rate of blood culture and antibiotic treatment decreased from 12.8% to 5.8% and 9.9% to 2.5% ( P &lt; .0001). Implications for Practice: The EOS calculator substantially and safely decreases blood work and antibiotic administration in asymptomatic newborns with maternal chorioamnionitis. Implications for Research: Our findings provide further evidence for the effectiveness and safety of the EOS calculator.

It is characterized by an abnormal proliferation of blood vessels in the developing retina and is the leading cause of childhood blindness in developed countries. This article describes a systematic approach to prospectively reduce the incidence of ROP in a newborn intensive care unit (NICU). We realized the need for improvement when we reviewed comparative data indicating that our rates of ROP were higher than those in NICUs in our local area, across the United States, and around the world. After informal efforts appeared successful in significantly reducing ROP, we designed and implemented a more structured approach to ROP prevention that included improvements in practice related to oxygen administration and monitoring. An evidence-based guideline was developed, and education was provided to all direct care providers. We also standardized bedside oxygen delivery equipment and implemented new parameters related to nasal cannula weaning. Rates of ROP, severe ROP, and ROP requiring surgical intervention were reduced by more than 50% during the first year and more than 75% by the end of the second year after implementation of our unit-based program.",

    "abstract": "Background: Infants with congenital or posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus may require a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt to divert the flow of cerebrospinal fluid, thus preventing increase in intracranial pressure. Knowledge on various aspects of caring for a child with a VP shunt will enable new and experienced nurses to better care for these infants and equip parents for ongoing care at home. Purpose: To review the nurses' role in care of infants with hydrocephalus, care after VP shunt placement, prevention of complications, and parental preparation for home care. Methods/Search Strategy: A literature review involving electronic databases, such as CINAHL and MEDLINE, Cochrane Database Systematic Reviews, and resources from the Web sites of the National Hydrocephalus Foundation and Hydrocephalus Association, was performed to gather evidence for current practice information. Findings and Implications for Practice and Research: Vigilant care can help with early identification of potential complications. The younger the infant at VP shunt placement, the higher the occurrence of complications. All neonatal intensive care unit nurses must be equipped with knowledge and skills to care for infants with hydrocephalus and those who undergo VP shunt placement. Monitoring for early signs of increased intracranial pressure can facilitate timely diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention. Equipping families will be helpful in early identification and timely management of shunt failure. Research on infants with VP shunt placement is essential to develop appropriate guidelines and explore experiences of families to identify caregiver burden and improve parental preparation.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To create a thermal map of ambient air, radiant, and evaporative temperatures and humidity throughout the NICU nursery by season across a calendar year. SUBJECTS: Each cubicle of the 32-bed NICU, distributed across 5 rooms, in a level III nursery was measured. METHODS: Temperatures were recorded at a consistent time on one day during January, April, July, and October. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: An electronic monitor (QUESTemp° 34; Quest Technologies, Oconomowoc, Wisconsin) was used to measure dry bulb, wet bulb, and globe thermometer temperatures. RESULTS: Analysis of variance revealed statistically significant (P ≤ .000) differences in season, room, and season by room interaction. Room ambient air temperatures differed by less than 2°F across season. Radiant temperature paralleled air temperature. Humidity, the predominant difference across season, produced evaporative temperatures considerably lower than room air temperature, and the gradient between mean nursery dry bulb temperature and wet bulb temperature was 9.3°F in summer and 16.8°F in winter. CONCLUSIONS: The thermal map revealed seasonal thermal differences, particularly in humidity level and evaporative temperature. Room temperature alone does not reflect the total thermal environment. Recommendations include periodic assessment of nurseries along with air, evaporative, and radiant temperatures as well as humidity to fully appreciate the impact of the thermal environment on infants.",

    "abstract": "Background: Respiratory distress syndrome remains the most common admission diagnosis in the neonatal intensive care unit. Healthcare providers have a clear appreciation for the potential harm to pulmonary structures that have been associated with mechanical ventilation (MV) in the preterm infant. Although life sustaining, the goal is to optimally ventilate while limiting trauma to the neonatal lung in order to preserve long-term cardiopulmonary and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Purpose: To describe, compare, and contrast 2 primary methods of neonatal MV, pressure-limited ventilation (PLV) and volume-targeted ventilation (VTV), highlighting key considerations during therapy. Methods: A comprehensive search of the literature was completed using the following databases: CINAHL, Cochrane, Google Scholar, and PubMed. Research articles that were published in English over the last 10 years were reviewed for key information to describe and support the topic. Expert content review was conducted prior to publication by respiratory care providers, neonatal nurse practitioners, staff nurses, and neonatologist. Findings: Technology is rapidly evolving, with the newest mechanical ventilators providing the clinician with real-time data not previously available. Advanced microprocessors and feedback mechanisms can better support various ventilatory strategies including PLV and VTV. Renewed interest in volume ventilation has led many clinicians to ask about current evidence to support ventilatory modalities with regard to timing, settings, and short- and long-term effects. Implications for Practice: The clinician understands that neonatal pulmonary status is frequently changing based on gestational age, current age, and physiologic influences. Evidence supporting recommendations for the described MV modalities of PLV and VTV is provided for both preterm and term neonates. Implications for Research: Comparison between MV strategies, specifically PLV and VTV, including short- and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes, is needed. Recommendations regarding physiologic tidal volume for the extremely preterm infant are lacking.",

    "abstract": "Background: Most standardized nursing care plans for healthy neonates include multiple nursing diagnoses to reflect nurses' judgments on the infant's status; however scientific literature concerning this issue is scarce. Newborn physiological immaturity is a concept in the ATIC terminology (architecture, terminology, interface, information, nursing [infermeria], and knowledge [coneixement]) to represent the natural status of vulnerability of the healthy neonate. Purpose: To identify the essential attributes of the concept and provide its conceptual and operational definition, using the Wilsonian approach. Findings: The concept under analysis embeds a natural cluster of vulnerabilities and environmental interactions that enhance the evolving maturation process. Implications for Practice: The use of this diagnosis may simplify the process of charting the nursing care plans and reduce time needed for documentation while maintaining the integrity of the information. Implications for Research: Consistent development and use of nursing concepts is essential for knowledge building. Studies on the actual use of nursing diagnoses are needed to inform decision making.",

On day 2, her computed tomography scan of head showed extensive intraventricular hemorrhage with intraparenchymal extension, which was reported as unexpected for an infant born close to term. She was diagnosed with congenital hyperinsulinemia. Her glucose levels normalized on diazoxide therapy started on day 6.

    "abstract": "What is a rare disease (RD)? It might seem to be self-evident, but \"rare disease\" has a specific definition. The US Food and Drug Administration defines an RD as one that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. As few as 5 people, or as many as 200,000, could have the same RD. Altogether, the National Institutes of Health estimates that more than 7000 RDs exist, and they affect 8% to 10% of the population, more than AIDS and cancer combined. It is a staggering number of people. However, without any kind of centralized reporting system, the number of people affected by RDs can only be estimated, and it could easily be much higher than we think. When we consider RDs in the newborn, we often think of the rare inherited metabolic disorders such as those on the newborn screening panel. However, metabolic disorders are only 1 category of RDs. RDs also encompass endocrine disorders, neurological disorders, rare cancers, rare infections, chromosomal abnormalities, rare syndromes, isolated birth defects, and many other diagnoses. Every neonatal nurse has taken care of infants with RDs and will take care of many more in the course of his or her career. You might never see a baby with STAR syndrome or Pentalogy of Cantrell, but you might, even tomorrow, see one with Turner syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, or a fatty acid oxidation disorder. The core principles of caring for the family of a neonate who might have, or is known to have an RD, are the same, regardless of the type of RD. These principles include a systematic approach to the evaluation of the neonate who presents with symptoms consistent with an RD, and 2 articles in this issue, contributed by authors from Children's National Medical Center in Washington, District of Columbia, outline such an approach. These authors also emphasize that multidisciplinary teamwork is the foundation of care in RDs. Most families will meet with a long line of specialists and subspecialists while they are in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and their infants will undergo many complicated tests. Clear communication is vital to prevent misunderstanding, confusion, and false hopes on the part of the parents. When an infant is being evaluated for a possible RD, the early involvement of metabolic specialists and/or clinical geneticists is invaluable. Many RDs are fatal, and still more have no specific treatment or cure. These situations must be handled with skill and sensitivity. The care of children who are living with RDs largely involves management of symptoms and prevention of complications, with the goal of maintaining the highest quality of life possible. It is extremely important for neonatal caregivers to understand that although neonates with RDs might be discharged from the NICU in relatively \"good shape,\" by our typical criteria, these diseases can worsen and become more complicated as these children grow. Some will undergo frequent hospitalizations; others will require a series of surgeries. Some children will leave the NICU before even receiving a definitive diagnosis, meaning that these families have to cope with a continuation of laboratory tests, imaging studies, biopsies, and other forms of evaluation, all on an outpatient basis. Many families will have to travel great distances at enormous personal expense to consult with experts in their child's particular RD. As NICU caregivers, we are witnesses to only a tiny fraction of what families will experience with their children with RD. Families are not out of the woods when they leave the NICU, and it is vital for us to have an understanding of what they are likely to face in the future. Two articles in this issue were written or cowritten by parents of children with RD, who generously share a perspective that we are privileged to learn about. Families are embarking on a long, tough, and frustrating road. Their endurance and faith will be tested daily. We can help by sending them down that road with the best possible information, guidance, and support. Within a relatively short period of time, these families will know far more about their children's RD than we do. They will become the experts, and rightly so. With thousands of RDs, few healthcare professionals can develop expertise in all but the most frequently encountered of the RDs, so the parents are in the best position to be their child's advocate, to understand their child's RD, and to partner with specialists to find the best treatment. They should not only be permitted, but encouraged, and mentored to do so. At the same time, especially during the first days and weeks of life, we must help parents sift through mountains of information and find what does and does not apply to their situation. In this era known as the information age, parents can rapidly become overwhelmed and discouraged by what they read about their child's RD. Fortunately, for most RDs, valuable and useful resources exist. Neonatal caregivers should become familiar with NORD (the National Organization for Rare Diseases; www.nord.org), because it is a superb, reliable starting point for both parents and healthcare professionals to learn about RDs. Through NORD, parents can find out about new drugs and treatments, clinical trials, advocacy opportunities, and patient registries, which are the best way for the scientific community to advance treatments for RDs today. As you read these articles, think about the infants and families you have cared for in the past. No doubt, much of what you read on these pages will prompt memories of babies and families who spent time in your NICU at the start of their journey with an RD. What you read might resonate with your experiences of the past and reinforce what you learned from those experiences. What you read will certainly be of value to you when you go to work tomorrow and admit another newborn who might have an RD. Acknowledgments The Co-editors and the Editorial Board would like to acknowledge the time, energy, and passion it has taken for Laura Stokowski to be the Guest Editor for this Special Issue on Rare Diseases. Laura is very dedicated to this population of infants and families and through her dedication she has shared with us a rare glimpse of what having a child with a rare disease means to the families and to the care providers who must support these families. Again, we applaud Laura for sharing this expertise with all of us.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 6% of births worldwide, 7.9 million children, are born with a serious genetic congenital abnormality each year. A factor thought to increase the prevalence of birth defects is parental consanguinity, which is a social custom practiced in at least 20% of the world's population.The purpose of this article is to explore the relationship between consanguinity and congenital defects. This article also aims to enhance neonatal healthcare practitioners' comprehension of its implications for practice and research.A review of literature was compiled from a search of the online databases Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), PubMed, EBSCO MegaFILE, and Google Scholar.Literature pertinent to this topic primarily consists of research studies that examine the inbreeding depression phenomenon through comparison of the prevalence of birth defects among the offspring of consanguineous and nonconsanguineous couples. Current studies indicate that the progeny of consanguineous couples are at an increased risk of congenital defects compared with those of nonconsanguineous couples.Consanguinity is one risk factor among many that can lead to a major birth defect. Relationships between consanguineous populations and neonatal healthcare practitioners such as registered nurses, advanced practice nurses, and physicians could significantly alter neonatal health outcomes. Specific recommendations such as genetic counseling and therapeutic communication are discussed.Further studies need to investigate the connection between consanguinity and birth defects while controlling for nongenetic variables. Moreover, a focus on consanguineous communities in the United States would prove beneficial.",

    "abstract": "Advanced prenatal screening and diagnostic testing have increased the number of newborns born with a confirmed diagnosis. Not all infants, however, are born with a known diagnosis. In fact, for some conditions, physical findings evolve over time and diagnosis can be further delayed because of premature birth.This article shares a case report of a dysmorphic preterm infant admitted to the intensive care nursery for routine care. The emergence of physical findings as the baby matured during the first weeks of life and the stepwise, diagnostic approach used to confirm a rare genetic condition, cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome, is provided.Key physical differences apparent at birth prompted screening for several genetic syndromes and a number of inborn errors of metabolism. As the phenotype emerged, a type of RASopathy entered the differential, the most likely of which was CFC syndrome.Although CFC syndrome is rare, the combined incidence rate of RASopathies is greater, and as such, providers should be familiar with such conditions. Classic features may not be apparent in preterm infants so providers must remain astute to physical changes and communicate them with genetic consultants.Gaining a better understanding of how providers can best support parents through the lengthy, diagnostic odyssey of genetic testing is important. In addition, ongoing research is needed to try to identify a genotype-phenotype correlation for CFC syndrome to guide patient surveillance and provide prognostic information to parents.",

    "abstract": "Background: The neonatal nurses are the key component of the essential workforce necessary to address the healthcare needs of the infants globally. The paucity of the data regarding the availability and training of the neonatal workforce challenges the stakeholders at the regional, national, and global levels. The lack of these data makes strategic planning for initiatives especially in low-resourced countries difficult. Up-to-date data are critically needed to describe the role neonatal nurses play in global newborn health outcomes. Purpose: The purpose of the COINN Global Neonatal Provider Database Initiative (CGNPD) was to develop a workforce database by developing survey questions, conducting a focus group to determine the key reasons such a database was needed and how best to implement it, and incorporating these comments into the workforce survey and launch. Pilot testing of the draft survey instrument was done. This article reports on the findings from the focus group and the development of the survey. Methods: A qualitative design using the focus group method was used. The focus group discussions were guided by semi-structured interview questions that had been developed prior to the focus group by neonatal experts. A convenience sample of 14 members from the international delegates and project advisory members who attended the COINN 2013 in Belfast, Northern Ireland, participated. These participants represented 10 countries. Thematic analysis was conducted using verbatim transcripts of the focus group data. Results: Four main themes emerged: (1) the invisibility of neonatal nurses, (2) benchmarking needs for quality and standards, (3) need for partnership to implement the database, and (4) setting priorities for variables needed for the most salient database. Implications for Practice: The questionnaire examined participants' perceptions of the significance of and the future utilization of the workforce database and elements that should be included in the survey. Implications for Research: The global neonatal workforce database is needed to describe who the neonatal nurses are in each country, what they do, how they are trained, and where they work. The data from the focus group aided in the development of the workforce survey that has been pilot tested and provides critical information to guide COINN's global implementation of the database project.",

Strict protocols are initiated, guiding the transport team in reaching and maintaining target temperature range of 33°C to 35°C.From June 2010 to January 2014, a total of 22 neonates who qualified for TH were transported using the care bundle. Eight were actively cooled, whereas 14 were passively cooled. Of note, 8 infants required warming for temperatures below the acceptable range. The average temperature before turning off the warmer at the referral center was 36.0°C (SD = 1.1). The average temperature upon arrival of the transport team was 34.9°C (SD = 1.4). The average temperature upon arrival to the receiving facility was 33.5°C (SD = 0.7).By utilizing a care bundle for the initiation of TH on transport, neonates can be safely delivered to a treatment center with an average temperature well within treatment range, all while avoiding extreme fluctuations.The number of qualified participants limited the study. Future research should focus on the effectiveness of the bundle in larger treatment populations, with inclusion of additional transport teams.",

First and most concerning is the statement by the authors that “breastfeeding usually/sometimes works well” for an infant with a cleft palate and recommendations in this regard (see Table 1 in Burca et al1). We caution the authors to avoid giving the impression that children with isolated cleft palate are likely to feed effectively or fully at the breast. The vast majority of children with a cleft palate do not feed well at the breast and require an adaptive feeding method. Efforts should focus on ways to improve availability of breast milk for these patients, beginning with support and education of parents during the prenatal visit, and continuing through the perinatal period and infancy. The advice that an infant with a cleft palate can breastfeed shows a misunderstanding of the sucking mechanics of an infant with a cleft palate, which is distinct from an infant with a cleft lip. As the authors point out, an infant with a cleft lip and intact palate will most likely be able to feed at the breast effectively. A lactation consultant can assist the mother with positioning to assist with lip seal, which often, but not always, allows breastfeeding. With a cleft palate, the infant is unable to generate sufficient intraoral suction to breastfeed effectively. Regardless of size or location of the cleft palate (as stated in the article), the presence of the cleft palate prohibits the infant from isolating the oral cavity from the nasal sinuses, thereby preventing the infant from developing the negative pressure vacuum needed to draw milk from the breast.2 There are only extremely rare cases where the mother and infant can work together so the infant may feed directly and fully from the breast. Second, the authors state that “infants with CL/P consume less milk, gain less weight, and measure lower on growth curves” than infants without CL/P. Nutrition in children with oral clefts has not been well studied. There are many potential confounders that impact the published studies suggesting suboptimal growth in children with clefts, and some studies have shown that children with clefts do have adequate growth whether or not the palate is involved.3 Given the mostly small or anecdotal studies in this field, the reason for poor growth may stem from infants who are not given appropriate feeding methods to compensate for the cleft or have other malformations or medical problems leading to inadequate nutritional status. Most infants with clefts who are managed with the proper feeding tools grow at the same rate as an infant without a cleft. Numerous adaptive bottles are available for infants with clefts, which assist with milk flow so the infant can feed well without needing to create a vacuum. Assistive devices may also be used at the breast but require careful instruction to ensure adequate milk intake. If there is a delay in diagnosing the cleft palate or implementing the correct feeding adaptation, there will be a risk of infant weight loss and diminishing maternal milk supply if milk expression is not started quickly after birth. Lastly, the authors state that “feeding human milk by bottle is the preferred approach if direct breastfeeding is not possible.” This is true for infants in high-resource settings. In low-resources settings, however, the World Health Organization and United Nations Children's Fund4,5 recommend cup feeding for infants unable to breastfeed as the safest tool. Because 94% of children born with an oral cleft are born in a developing country,6 this advice should be included in guidance on adaptive equipment to support feeding. We do applaud the authors for their efforts but believe it is imperative that the clinical community clearly understand the differences in the potential for infants with various types of clefts to feed at the breast. What does not differ is the ability of these infants to benefit from breast milk feeding. Future efforts should focus on interventions to support mothers in providing this valuable source of nutrition to their infants.

    "abstract": "There is growing awareness of the relationship between physical work environments and efficiency. Two conflicting factors shape efficiency in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) environment: the move to single-family rooms (SFRs) and increased demand for care, requiring growth in unit size.The goal of this research was to understand the impact of SFR NICUs on efficiency factors such as unit design, visibility and proximity, staff time, and workspace usage by various health professionals.A pre-/postoccupancy evaluation assessed a NICU moving from an open-bay to an SFR unit composed of 6 neighborhoods. A NICU patient care manager and researchers in design and communication implemented a multimethodological design using staff surveys, observations, and focus groups.Outcomes revealed SFR NICUs contribute to increased efficiency and overall satisfaction with design. Outside of staff time spent in patient rooms, decentralized nurse stations were the most frequented location for staff work, followed by huddle stations, medication and supply rooms, and corridors. Work at the observed locations was largely performed independently. Survey outcomes reported increased feelings of isolation, but focus groups revealed mixed opinions regarding these concerns.Design solutions found to enhance efficiency include a neighborhood unit design, standardized access to medications and supplies, and proximity of supplies, patient rooms, and nurse workstations. Although feelings of isolation were reported and most staff work was done independently in the patient room, the SFR unit might not be the culprit when considered alongside staff's desire to be closer to the patient room.",

Additionally, unpublished studies across relevant trial registries, conference proceedings, websites, and organizations were reviewed for possible inclusion. A total of 1610 articles met selection criteria through database and register searches and 20 through manual reference searches.Inclusion criteria were primary research studies, written in English, published between 2009 and 2022, including a sample of infants with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome/neonatal abstinence syndrome, and focusing on the relationship between the receipt of human milk and the infant gut microbiome.Two authors independently conducted title/abstract and full-text review until there was consensus of study selection.No studies satisfied the inclusion criteria, which resulted in an empty review.Findings from this study document the paucity of data exploring the associations between human milk, the infant gut microbiome, and subsequent neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. Further, these results highlight the timely importance of prioritizing this area of scientific inquiry.",

Although they considered the separation as undesired, wanting to be with their newborn infant, it was secondary to not wanting to infect the infant with COVID-19. Furthermore, lacking information about a potentially lethal virus adds to the uncertainty that comes with having a newborn. The separation affected the whole family, some for a long time afterward.If a new situation with potentially life-threatening effects, like the COVID-19 pandemic, occurs again, considering the experiences of these parents is paramount. Precautions should be taken to minimize the potential harm. If a separation between newborns and parents is inevitable, parents need preparation and transparent information prior to the separation and before the reunion. Well-thought-out policies must be in place to minimize the impact of a separation on both parties. Parents should be able to have a deputy parent present during an undesired but necessary separation from their newborn.",

    "abstract": "I read with great interest the article by Brashear et al,1 demonstrating the effect of handling on preterm infants. They showed that preterm infants had significant changes in heart rate and oxygen saturation when exposed to stressful care procedures (SPCs), defined as “direct or indirect procedures causing physical uneasiness or annoyance or disrupting the balance between the neonate and its environment.” Although transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) was not listed as an SPC in Brashear et al's Table 1,1 we assume it is an SPC, just like the temperature measurement. TABLE 1. - Time of First Total Serum Bilirubin in Less Than 30-Week Infants Case No Gestational Age, wk Birth Weight, g First TSB, mg/dL The Time When the First TSB Was Available, h:min 1 226/7 420 2.2 10:17 2 236/7 470 6.6 6:31 3 236/7 685 4.4 18:42 4 255/7 670 6.1 11:26 5 256/7 800 4.1 15:31 6 265/7 545 5.9 24:45 7 265/7 755 6.1 25:45 8 266/7 670 3.2 13:01 9 27 1100 3 8:59 Abbreviation: TSB, total serum bilirubin. TcB is used as a screening tool for monitoring neonatal jaundice. We recently published the value of TcB as a screening tool for monitoring jaundice in term infants in the first 6 hours of life.2 Sankar et al3 extended the role of TcB as a screening tool for monitoring jaundice in extremely preterm (EP) infants. They showed a good correlation between TcB and serum bilirubin levels. The advantage of TcB is that it is a noninvasive tool; however, it is an SPC. Using the readily available indwelling umbilical catheters, we monitor total serum bilirubin (TSB) in EP infants. To minimize blood volume, some centers use point-of-care devices to measure TSB.4–6 The other caveat in measuring TcB in these EP infants is the interference with phototherapy. Most EP infants required early phototherapy, which could mask the TcB readings.7 The findings of Brashear et al1 and Sankar et al3 pose an important question: Do we need TcB in EP infants in addition to TSB? To find the answer, we performed a quick scan of our neonatal intensive care unit to see the range of TSB levels and the time taken to obtain the first TSB in a selected group of EP infants born at less than 30 weeks' gestational age. We screened 9 EP infants. The time range for the first TSB varied from 6 to 26 hours (Table 1). The TSB ranged from 2.2 to 6.6 mg/dL. Our unit policy is to obtain the laboratory test as morning laboratory test results (drawn from 5 to 6 am). The infant (case 2) was born at 23:29 and had bilirubin drawn the next morning (6 hours). The infants (cases 6 and 7, twins) were born at 4:25 and 4:26 am and had the laboratory test results drawn the next morning (24 and 25 hours). All our infants had their blood drawn through the umbilical arterial or venous catheters (which one is available). We do not obtain electrolytes (the complete metabolic profile [CMP]) at admission. CMP is ordered as the morning laboratory test result. In summary, concerning the findings of Brashear et al,1 TcB should be regarded as an SPC. It is helpful in term infants,2 but its use in preterm infants should be viewed critically. In high-risk cases, TSB could be obtained with admission laboratory test results. The risk of changes in heart rate and oxygen saturation with serial TcBs could be detrimental to EP infants. —Shabih Manzar, MD, MPH Department of Pediatrics Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport",

    "abstract": "Background: Infants and families requiring neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) care often experience significant stress and trauma during the earliest period of the infant's life, leading to increased risks for poorer infant and family outcomes. There is a need for frameworks to guide clinical care and research that account for the complex interactions of generational stress, pain, toxic stress, parental separation, and lifelong health and developmental outcomes for infants and families. Purpose: Apply the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) framework in the context of the NICU as a usable structure to guide clinical practice and research focused on infant neurodevelopment outcomes and parental attachment. Methods: An overview of ACEs is provided along with a detailed discussion of risk at each level of the ACEs pyramid in the context of the NICU. Supportive and protective factors to help mitigate the risk of the ACEs in the NICU are detailed. Results: NICU hospitalization may be considered the first ACE, or potentially an additional ACE, resulting in an increased risk for poorer health outcomes. The promotion of safe, stable, and nurturing relationships and implementation of trauma-informed care and individualized developmental care potentially counter the negative impacts of stress in the NICU. Implications for Practice and Research: Nurses can help balance the negative and positive stimulation of the NICU through activities such as facilitated tucking, skin-to-skin care, mother's milk, and active participation of parents in infant care. Future research can consider using the ACEs framework to explain cumulative risk for adverse health and well-being in the context of NICU care.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE To develop an accurate method of weighing ventilated infants in the clinical setting. SUBJECTS Two dolls that simulated ventilated infants were adapted to different weights ranging from 745 to 3,995 g. DESIGN Four methods of weighing ventilated infants were evaluated. The study design used multiple clinical nurses, randomly chosen, to weigh the simulated infants. Freestanding and in-bed scales were used with a simulated ventilated infant being either connected or disconnected from the ventilator tubing for the procedure. RESULTS The mean weights of the simulated infants measured in the incubator, with or without the ventilator connected, had a mean difference of ±2 g from the gold standard. However, the mean weights of the simulated infants measured on the freestanding scales were 12 g < the gold standard of industry calibrated weights (P < 0.001). The measurement error was small both with and without the ventilator connected. This error was proportionally very small for weights over 1,500 g, but was increased for weights < 1,500 g. CONCLUSION The use of in-bed scales was the most accurate method of weighing simulated infants of all weight categories. This study shows the importance of a consistent and meticulous technique when weighing infants in intensive care. The accuracy of weights is enhanced with the use of in-bed scales, and this is particularly significant in infants less than 1,500 g.",

For issues 2019 (1) and 2019 (2), we have strategically grouped together a collection of articles related to strategies to support oral feeding of high-risk infants. These are not articles submitted to be included in a special series; however, we noted a trend in our submissions and thought publishing the articles together could be advantageous to our readers. Feeding infants is an activity encountered almost daily by every neonatal nurse in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). As the monetary pressure to discharge infants home to families continues to increase, feeding strategies are continually under refinement since oral feeding success is the infant milestone that often opens the door to NICU discharge. How do we help infants be successful with oral feeding? What are the best strategies to support these infants as they and their families prepare for discharge to home? What evidence is there to consider new or different strategies for supporting infants during the transition to full oral feedings be that by tube-feedings, at the breast, or by bottle-feeding? These questions among others are addressed in the articles included in this special collection of articles. Choice of feeding strategies is often dependent on infant maturation, parental choices, and availability of the mother (or parent) to participate. There is much debate about when it is best to begin offering oral feeding, with some suggesting as early as 28 to 30 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) for nuzzling at the mother's breast. Yet, one must first establish what is the purpose of these offerings. At 28 to 30 weeks PMA, the purpose is usually quite different from that at later points in development. Early offerings are often about the experience for both the infant and the mother. Later feeding offerings are more about developing the skills to successfully attain full-oral feeding competence. We hope you noticed we used the word “offering.” This choice was purposeful because we believe oral feeding is a cooperative event, whereby both the infant and the caregiver participate equally. The caregiver strategically provides the right amount of support to allow the infant to be successful and acknowledges that success at 30 weeks PMA might be quite different from success at 38 weeks PMA. In this issue, Logomarsino and colleagues provide the evidence to consider safety in feeding high-risk infants. Making choices that increase success is often about how mature the infants are and whether they can safely protect their airway. Griffith builds on this concept by examining exactly what is feeding success. She and her colleagues provide a sound way to consider what is “success.” Conveying the level of success to all care providers and particularly parents is important in understanding the infant's feeding progression. Most NICU infants will receive some of their oral feedings from a bottle even if the mother intends to provide oral feedings directly at the breast. More understanding about how to support mothers and infants in the NICU who intend to exclusively breastfeed is needed. The articles in this issue do not provide as much information about direct feeding at the breast but stay-tuned there are articles in 2019 (2) that address this matter. For infants receiving bottle-feedings, understanding how to choose the best nipple to support the progression of oral feeding is important. Pados and colleagues provide us with increased understanding about how one might choose a nipple. The number of different nipples on the market is increasing and parents/caregivers need direction about how to make sound choices when purchasing different nipples to support the infant's success. Almost every nipple on the market claims to be exactly what is needed for success, yet there are little data to support those claims. The findings of this study highlight the need to consider the nipple choice as important to the process. Infant-driven feeding is more often, than not, considered the best way to support high-risk infants transitioning to full-oral feedings but what does that really mean? Also in this issue, Settle and colleagues provide us with the evidence to make better choices about what infant-driven feeding is and how best to provide it when caring for these infants. Infant-driven feeding is not just about feeding - it is also about co-regulation of feeding between the infant and the caregiver. Lastly, Fucile and colleagues provide us with the evidence about how to make choices for sensorimotor interventions that might increase oral feeding success. Every infant is an individual and no matter the evidence we must collaboratively work together to consider the individual needs of the infant and the available strategies with the right definition for success to support both the infant and the family. We hope you find this a helpful special series of articles and please stay-tuned for the next collection of oral feeding articles in 2019 (2).

    "abstract": "Background: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a complex congenital defect of the diaphragm that allows abdominal contents to herniate into the chest cavity, altering pulmonary development, and leading to pulmonary hypoplasia and hypertension. Patient presentation is variable in severity, making management difficult. Many common management strategies have improved the survival rate of infants with CDH, including gentle ventilation and permissive hypercapnia. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is a potent, pulmonary vasodilator that has shown to improve oxygenation while decreasing pulmonary pressure in infants with pulmonary hypertension. While many institutions utilize iNO in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension, the role of iNO as a treatment for CDH is controversial. Purpose: The purpose of this literature review is to establish a better understanding of CDH including embryology, patient presentation, and management strategies, and to analyze the use and effect of iNO on patients in this population. Methods/Search Strategy: A systemic search of PubMed, CINHAL, and Medline was performed to identify research articles studying the use of iNO on patients with pulmonary hypertension secondary to CDH. Findings/Results: Three studies were utilized in this review to assess the current use and effectiveness of iNO in patients with CDH. Implications for Practice: This review summarized the pathophysiology, embryology, patient presentation, and management strategies, as well as reviewed literature on the effectiveness of iNO on pulmonary hypertension secondary to CDH. Implications for Research: Further research is indicated to determine alternative treatment modalities and establish evidence-based practice protocols to standardize care in infants with CDH.",

    "abstract": "Background: Atrial flutter (AFL) is an uncommon arrhythmia in the pediatric population. It is defined as fast ordered atrial depolarization (about 250-500 beats/min). It occurs mainly in children with congenital heart defects; however, it may also manifest in fetuses and infants with an anatomically healthy heart. In neonates, AFL is most often revealed within the first 2 days after birth. Clinical Findings: In this case report, we present 3 neonates without complex congenital heart defects with AFL, along with the description of the course, diagnostic and therapeutic processes depending on the clinical condition of a child, and response to treatment. Primary Diagnosis: Symptoms in this group of patients are nonspecific, that is, tachypnea, unwillingness to eat, and fatigue while feeding. The diagnostic process included thorough electro- and echocardiographic assessments. Each child was treated individually due to a different cause of arrhythmia and comorbidities. Interventions: Invasive (electrical cardioversion) and pharmacological methods were used in treatment to achieve conversion to sinus rhythm. Outcomes: One patient required electrical cardioversion, one was treated with amiodarone and digoxin, and one infant received amiodarone. All children achieved conversion to sinus rhythm. Practice Recommendations: During the follow-up, each child maintained sinus rhythm, which shows that in the neonatal group, it is a unique, but well-controlled, arrhythmia once conversion to sinus rhythm is achieved.",

    "abstract": "A genetic disorder should be considered when an infant presents with multiple congenital anomalies. Because of the acute presentation of an infant with multiple life-threatening defects, a genetic diagnosis of a rare disorder took weeks to delineate.This case describes a late preterm infant who presented at birth with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, tetralogy of Fallot, cleft lip, low-set ears, and hypertelorism.Donnai-Barrow syndrome was the final diagnosis confirmed by a defect observed on the LRP2 (2q31.1) gene using sequence analysis. This is a rare disorder that presents with a variety of phenotypic features in infants.Initial neonatal resuscitation in the delivery room included intubation, positive pressure ventilation, and oxygen supplementation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy was initiated from day of life 3 to 15. Initial surgery included correction of the congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and further surgical procedures included tracheostomy, gastrostomy tube, circumcision, ventricular septal defect repair, and cleft lip repair. Physical, occupational, and speech therapies were also initiated.The infant was transported to a pediatric rehabilitation facility at 6 months of life for further management of his chronic lung disease requiring tracheostomy with ventilator dependence.Early recognition and diagnosis of genetic syndromes can improve family education and guide treatment interventions. An underlying syndrome should be suspected when an infant presents with multiple congenital defects. Infants with Donnai-Barrow syndrome should have thorough cardiac, neurologic, ophthalmologic, audiologic, and renal examinations due to the gene mutation effects on those systems.",

    "abstract": "In a joint effort with the National Perinatal Association (NPA), the National Association of Neonatal Nurses (NANN) released a position statement on care of the mother–newborn dyad during the COVID-19 pandemic on May 11, 2020. As a professional representation of neonatal nurses, NANN recognizes the importance of evidence-based care to guide practice and drive policy, particularly in these unprecedented times. The 3 driving principles of evidence-based practice are the consideration of (1) current research evidence, (2) clinical expertise, and (3) patient values. Healthcare providers are facing new and unique challenges with limited understanding and evolving recommendations. The purpose of the joint statement is to guide healthcare providers, including neonatal nurses, when care requires balancing between considerations and implications surrounding the \"golden hour\"1 and developmental care with considerations and implications surrounding infectious disease practices amidst a pandemic. The position statement is written on the basis of current peer-reviewed literature and recent recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,2 the World Health Organization,3 and the American Academy of Pediatrics.4 A consistent message provided by all 3 major organizations is the integration of a shared decision model to identify the best care for the mother–infant dyad while maintaining safety for everyone. The model is based on the 3 driving principles of evidence-based practice: up-to-date empirical evidence, expertise from the team of multidisciplinary care providers, and maternal/family preferences. Both NANN and NPA understand the atypical and evolving considerations that each institution encounters daily, thereby limiting the feasibility of a perfect care scenario. It is essential for neonatal nurses, and all care providers, to remain aware of the myriad of emotions experienced by the family, especially grief and trauma, that may negatively impact postpartum mental health and the fourth trimester. Maintaining sensitivity to unmet expectations and incorporating increased care interactions during the postpartum period should be considered. To guide evidence-based care during these unique times, NANN recommends neonatal nurses: Remain informed on current research; Provide the professional and unique perspective from nursing in the development and implementation of inpatient care plans; and Understand, respect, and advocate for maternal/family values, needs, and preferences. The foundation of nursing exemplified by Florence Nightingale includes holistic care and patient advocacy. Reflecting on the pivotal role of nursing in any healthcare crisis emphasizes the key role of neonatal nurses as we navigate through the uncertainty and changing times in this Year of the Nurse.",

    "abstract": "Background: Smaller preterm infants often receive extra attention with implementation of additional thermoregulation interventions in the delivery room. Yet, these bundles of interventions have largely remained understudied in larger infants. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate initial (or admission) temperatures of infants born weighing 1500 g or more with diagnoses requiring admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Methods: Retrospective medical record review of 388 infants weighing 1500 g or more admitted to the NICU between January 2016 and June 2017. Result: In total, 42.5% of infants weighing 1500 g or more were admitted hypothermic (&lt;36.5°C), 54.4% with a normothermic temperature, and 2.8% were hyperthermic. Of those infants admitted hypothermic, 30.4% had an admission temperature ranging from 36°C to 36.4°C and 12.1% had an admission temperature of less than 36°C. When compared with infants weighing less than 1500 g, who were born at the same institution and received extra thermal support interventions, there was a statistically significant difference ( P &lt; .001) between admission temperatures where infants less than 1500 g were slightly warmer (36.8°C vs 36.5°C). Implications for Practice: Ongoing admission temperature monitoring of all infants requiring NICU admission regardless of birth weight or admission diagnosis is important if we are going to provide the best support to decrease mortality and morbidity for this high-risk population. Implications for Research: While this study examined short-term outcomes, effects on long-term outcomes were not addressed. Findings could be used to design targeted interventions to support thermal regulation for all high-risk infants. Conclusion: Neonates admitted to the NICU weighing 1500 g or more are at high risk for developing hypothermia, similar to smaller preterm infants.",

    "abstract": "Background: Infants diagnosed with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) often spend several weeks in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and have difficulty being consoled. Infant carriers may be used to help with irritability, while allowing the adult user to be more mobile, through the practice of babywearing (the facilitated holding of an infant using a soft cloth infant carrier worn on the body). Purpose: To examine the experience of babywearing infants diagnosed with NAS while admitted in the NICU from the perspective of the nurses who care for them. Methods: Nurses (N = 18; mean age = 35.44 years, SD = 9.45) were recruited and interviewed using a semistructured interview method from a 38-bed NICU in the Southwestern United States. Results: A thematic content analyses using an open coding scheme yielded 6 themes that fell into 2 categories: (1) benefits of babywearing infants with NAS in the NICU (Infant Consoling, Adult Multitasking, Caregiver–Infant Trust); and (2) suggestions to maximize babywearing in the NICU (Infection Control, Reoccurring Infant Carrier Education, and Reduced Patient Load). Implications for Practice: Many NICUs incorporate kangaroo care (or skin-to-skin contact) as a treatment option; however, NICU staff cannot participate in kangaroo care. Babywearing is a practical alternative for nurses and support staff. Nurses supported the practice of babywearing as a means to improve the well-being of infants with NAS while also allowing for increased efficiency in nursing tasks. Implications for Research: More prospective studies are needed that evaluate the carryover effects and long-term impact of babywearing for infants diagnosed with NAS.",

Diagnosis is made if an infant requires oxygen therapy at 36 weeks' corrected age or discharge home. BPD increases healthcare costs, mortality rates, and risk of long-term respiratory complications and neurosensory impairments.The purpose of this project was to improve rates and severity of BPD in very premature infants without increasing length of hospitalization.A multidisciplinary care bundle involving respiratory support and medication use guidelines was created and implemented along with a noninvasive ventilation algorithm for the delivery room. This bundle was utilized for infants born in a Midwest hospital in 2019 at less than 32 weeks of gestation and the outcomes were compared to infants born in 2017.Implementation of this BPD prevention bundle contributed to a decrease in the use of oxygen at discharge for very premature infants without increasing length of hospitalization. Use of invasive mechanical ventilation and the severity of BPD also decreased.A multidisciplinary bundle approach can be successful in decreasing the rates of BPD for very premature infants. Future quality improvement projects should focus on improving delivery room management of extremely premature infants, with an emphasis on optimizing noninvasive ventilation strategies. More research is still needed to determine the best method of ventilation for premature infants and the best utilization of surfactant and corticosteroids.",

We noticed a delay in nLOS detection and management in our neonatal intensive care unit. Purpose: To develop an assessment tool to aid in the recognition and reporting of nLOS and to standardize the management process once sepsis is recognized. Methods: The Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) improvement model provided the framework for interventions for our antibiotic stewardship program, including the aims of this project. A literature review was performed to evaluate tools and other literature available to guide the evaluation and management of suspected sepsis. A quality improvement project was initiated to develop tools for the detection and management of nLOS. Results: An nLOS assessment tool to help identify neonates at risk for nLOS and a Code Sepsis checklist to standardize the process of evaluation and management of nLOS were developed. The guiding principles of this tool development were empowerment of nurses to initiate the assessment process, clarification of team roles, and removal of barriers to appropriate antibiotic administration. Implications for Practice: Useful and practical tools valued by nursing and the multidisciplinary team may facilitate timely identification and treatment of infants with nLOS. Implications for Research: Future directions include validation of the nLOS assessment tool and the Code Sepsis checklist as well as ensuring the reliability of the tool to improve detection of nLOS and to reduce time to administer antibiotics in cases of nLOS.",

    "abstract": "Background: In the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), maintaining an oxygenation level that avoids both hypoxemia and hyperoxemia is challenging. Pulse oximetry has become fundamental for noninvasive monitoring of saturation of peripheral oxygen (Sp o 2 ) in preterm newborns. Purpose: The aim of this systematic review is to determine Sp o 2 target values in order to avoid hypoxemia or hyperoxemia and complications arising from these. Method and Search Strategy: For this systematic review, articles were audited from 2010 to 2020 using the PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases were used, and search terms were related to use of pulse oximetry in the NICU. Results: The result showed that 12 of 20 (60%) studies focused on target values but without a unanimous agreement on values, although 5 of 12 studies (41.66%) suggested a lower value target of 85% and 4 of 12 studies (33.33%) recommended 95% as the higher target value. Other authors showed no difference in the incidence of adverse events comparing different target values and focused the importance more on the fluctuation of the value than on the target value itself. Implication for Practice: Reaching a balance in the oxygen administration so as to avoid potential complications associated with hypoxemia or hyperoxemia is a challenge for the clinicians. Implication for Research: Further studies on fluctuation of Sp o 2 comparing different starting targets could better clarify the role of fluctuations and the absolute target values.

    "abstract": "Background: Timely central venous access is essential in the care of critically ill neonates. Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are the preferred form of central venous access when umbilical venous catheters cannot be placed or are discontinued. However, time delays increase risk for injury from peripheral intravenous lines and may contribute to inconsistent delivery of necessary fluids and medications. Purpose: The aim of this quality improvement project was to decrease wait times for PICC placement in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Methods: A unit-based PICC team was developed consisting of NICU nurses and attending neonatologists and implemented in 2 phases. Data were collected from chart reviews before, during, and after implementation of the team. We tracked time between PICC order and placement and number of attempts. Hospital metrics on peripheral intravenous line infiltrations and central line–associated blood stream infection were also monitored. At the end of the project, we continued tracking outcomes to determine whether gains would be sustained past the project period. Results: Implementation of a unit-based interdisciplinary specialty team led to a 50% reduction in mean PICC wait times from 1.2 days to 0.58 days. Benefits of the initiative were sustained past the initial project period. Implications for Practice: The development of a dedicated, local team played a key role in improving vascular access in the NICU. Implications for Research: Proximity of specialized teams provides a solution to address gaps in care in the NICU.",

Combining the nose–ear–mid-umbilicus (NEMU) method with a birth weight (BW)–based method to determine optimal insertion length of OG tubes could reduce misplacement in extremely low birth-weight (ELBW) infants. Purpose: The objective of this study was to determine whether combining the NEMU method with a BW-based method to determine insertion length of OG tubes reduces misplacement of OG tubes in ELBW infants younger than 6 hours. Methods: The study included 129 ELBW infants in the NICU younger than 6 hours. We compared the frequency of OG tube misplacements in ELBW infants during 2 different time periods. In period I, the insertion length of OG tubes was estimated with the NEMU method alone. In period II, the insertion length of OG tubes was estimated by combining the NEMU method with a BW-based method. OG tubes were considered misplaced if the tip was above the diaphragm (high) or near the pylorus (low) in radiographs obtained after placement. Results: Infants who had OG tubes placed by combining both methods were less likely to have low OG tubes (53% in period I vs 34% in period II; P &lt; .05). The BW-based method alone predicted optimal OG tube insertion length in 57 of 89 infants (64%). Implications for Practice and Research: Combining the NEMU method with the BW-based method increases the probability of optimal OG tube placement in ELBW infants. Additional studies across multiple centers would validate the diagnostic accuracy of this method.

Trauma-informed developmental neuroprotective care (TIDNC) may positively influence the outcomes for micro-preemie infants (infants born before 26 weeks' gestation) as well as support parents in crisis. Purpose: To explore how TIDNC influences micro-preemie parents' perceptions of nursing care and support. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at a 56-bed level III neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). A convenience sample of micro-preemie parents (n = 16, 46%) completed the Nurse Parent Support Tool (NPST) questionnaire, which included 2 open-ended questions. Results: These parents scored high scores on the NPST (mean = 4.62 ± 0.24), indicating most parents felt support from the nursing staff and perceived individualized family-centered high-quality nursing care. Subscale scores were higher than all previous studies. Parents perceived high levels of support most of the time to almost always. Although 4 themes were closely associated with the subscales, the fifth theme, Praise has not been previously documented. Parents were grateful for nurses who provided compassionate care and support during one of the most difficult times of their lives. Implications for Practice: TIDNC encourages robust nurse–parent authentic caring relationships, which are foundational to the parents' perceptions of nursing care and support. These relationships, built on mutual trust, respect, and genuine listening, appear to foster an exceptionally high degree of support. Implications for Research: More research is needed to examine how unit culture, characteristics of nurses, parents, and infants as well as infant outcomes influence micro-preemie parents' perception of care and further explore the nature of support.",

The survey included 299 NICU nurses and physicians from 31 tertiary-level NICUs across China (response rate = 96.5%).The respondents showed a positive attitude toward implementing FICare and recognized its positive impact on infants. However, some respondents raised concerns regarding its feasibility and limitations of the NICU setting. The respondents' perceptions and attitudes of FICare varied based on their personal characteristics, such as marital status and day/night work shifts.Most NICU nurses and physicians reported that FICare can benefit infants. Despite some constraints related to the NICU environmental conditions, most NICU leaders felt positive about implementing FICare in China. Therefore, establishing key strategies for performing FICare, selecting appropriate personnel, and educating the staff regarding FICare are useful approaches to promote FICare implementation. FICare requires the team's collaborative effort with the support of NICU leaders to overcome system and setting barriers. Nurses should serve as navigators to guide its implementation. More studies on healthcare setting policies, parents' perceptions, and approaches for healthcare professionals to perform FICare in China are required.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE A preliminary study of a new optical oscillometric method to noninvasively measure systolic, mean, and diastolic blood pressures, in addition to heart and respiratory rates in very small extremities, is described. It employs transillumination of an extremity and measures the optical oscillation amplitude during cuff deflation from suprasystolic to zero pressure. The amplitude of the optical pulsatile oscillations is similar to that produced with the conventional pneumatic oscillometric method; however, the pulsatile optical signal is much larger and is present at all times when the cuff is deflated. METHODS AND DESIGN Two types of blood pressure verification studies were performed: (1) a weanling piglet study using a weanling piglet tail and (2) a human study using the little fingers of adult participants. For the weanling piglet study, direct femoral artery pressure, tail-cuff pressure, and optical oscillations were recorded in 5 anesthetized weanling piglets ranging in weight from 2 to 4 kg. Ten measurements were made in the pressure range of 30 to 175 mm Hg. For human study, data were obtained from 23 adult participants of both sexes with a little finger circumference of 4 cm or less. Radial artery pressure, measured with the conventional pneumatic oscillometric method, was used as the standard and was compared with the simultaneous optical oscillometric pressure in the little finger of the opposite arm. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES This is an initial study demonstrating the optical oscillometric technique as a viable alternative for noninvasive blood pressure measurement in low birth-weight infants. PRINCIPAL RESULTS The weanling piglet data show a high correlation between direct arterial pressure and this new optical oscillometric method over a pressure range of approximately 30 to 175 mm Hg. The correlation coefficients of linear regression were 0.93, 0.93, and 0.91, respectively. The human little finger data show a high correlation between the pneumatic oscillometric mean arterial pressure and this new optical oscillometric method over a pressure range of approximately 40 to 140 mm Hg. The correlation coefficient of linear regression was 0.87. CONCLUSIONS This new optical oscillometric technique simplifies noninvasive blood pressure measurement because it was designed specifically for small-diameter extremities such as those found in low birth-weight infants. This new optical oscillometric device has the added benefit of continually monitoring pulse and respiration rates.",

Anatomic and physiologic anomalies require an extended hospitalization with procedural analgesia and sedation that impact the mother's experience of birth, maternal response, and nurturing of her infant.The aim of this study was to understand the meaning of experiences that mothers of infants born with LGEA encounter in the neonatal intensive care unit while their infant undergoes esophageal repair.A hermeneutical phenomenological design was used to guide this inquiry. Three mothers were interviewed on 3 separate occasions. The conversations were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The findings were analyzed using fundamental existential lifeworld themes.The essence that conceptualized the study was \"making connections: day-by-day.\" Themes that emerged are (a) the many phases; (b) the long and winding road; (c) a new me, my purpose; and (d) our new community.Nurses' knowledge and understanding of maternal experiences of having an infant with LGEA will enable for increased physical closeness, optimizing time spent together to learn their infant's unique personality. Creating partnerships with mothers can enhance our understanding of their perspectives, concerns, needs, and guide interventions.Further exploration of family dynamics including fathers, siblings, and contextual factors may illuminate interventions to enhance relationships and communication that may influence developmental outcomes for families of infants with LGEA.",

    "abstract": "Dear NANN colleagues, In this issue, we have included a letter that was sent to the editors in response to an article published in Advances in Neonatal Care (ANC) 2016 issue 5.1 The authors' letter provided clarification and information about feeding infants with a cleft palate. We asked the authors of the original article whether they wanted to respond to this letter, and they chose not to respond because they believed the comments within the letter added clarity to their work. We thank the letter authors for their careful review of work published in ANC. This kind of review is important to us and definitely important to our readers. We want the content in the journal to be clear and correct; letters to the editor often facilitate increased clarity about content in a published work. This editorial is intended to inform you about when you should consider writing a letter to the editor. SO WHY MIGHT YOU WRITE A LETTER TO THE EDITOR? Letters can be about information shared in a particular article published in any section or any issue of the journal. If your letter is about the content of a particular article, please clearly identify the article and submit your commentary in a timely way so that the letter is helpful to the authors and to our readers. Six months from the time of the publication of the original content has been suggested as appropriate time frame for submitting a letter that is in response to a particular article; however, critiques of findings in original research are always welcome in ANC.2 Research findings need to be clearly presented and easily understood by our readers, and a letter to the editor might increase clarity or help our readers better understand the relevance of the research to their practice. Letters may also provide more detail about current practices or recommend additional evidence-based practice changes. Letters of these types provide a different perspective of clinical practice and can also provide a more complete picture about the originally published content. References are very helpful for letters that make statements based on published evidence such as previous research findings, well-known facts, or conceptual models and theories that would inform and strengthen the contents of the original article published in ANC. Letters may also address specific inaccuracies in any published content. Errors happen; we are all human, and, yet, our patients are also important to each of us, so thoughtfully identifying and correcting errors are important to the provision of excellent neonatal care. Letters may also be related to a section of the journal or the overall format or style of the journal. Letters should provide constructive feedback that may highlight both positive and negative aspects of the journal. Letters can be related to a particular section of the journal such as Clinical Issues in Neonatal Care and may include information about how the content informs your practice or could better inform your practice. Letters could also be about content you would like to see in the section or content you found difficult to read or not helpful to your practice since that is the focus of this section. Letters should be concise and focused on the particular issues in the published article. In addition, letters should not be long; less than 350 words is often recommended.2 Personal attacks of authors are never helpful and are not considered worthy of publication. What is more helpful to our readers and authors is thoughtful rationale for why the content is incorrect or does not meet your practice needs. Anonymously submitted letters will not be considered for publication in ANC. However, at the request of the authors, we would thoughtfully consider publishing the letter without the author identified on a case-by-case basis. We know that writing can be scary for many of you, but please do not let your fears overcome your passion for providing excellent care to our vulnerable infants and their families. We hope you will continue to read, scrutinize, review, and share with your colleagues the articles you read in ANC and consider writing a letter to the editors. Letters should be submitted through Editorial Manager in the same way as manuscripts. The journal editors will review the letter and assess for publication. We will also allow the author(s) of the original content the opportunity to respond to issues raised within the letter. Please write us letters; we would love to hear your thoughts about the content of ANC. Thank you for your support, Jacqueline M. McGrath, PhD, RN, FNAP, FAAN Co-Editor; Advances in Neonatal Care [email protected] Debra Brandon, PhD, RN, CCNS, FAAN Co-Editor; Advances in Neonatal Care [email protected]",

Fluid supplementation has been proposed to reduce serum bilirubin levels.To assess the risks and benefits of fluid supplementation compared with standard fluid management in preterm infants with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia under conventional phototherapy.A retrospective cohort study of preterm infants (gestational ages ≥28 to ≤32 weeks) admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit at the Maternity and Children Hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2017, and required the initiation of phototherapy in the first week of life.One hundred and fifteen infants were included; 51 received fluid supplementation, and 64 received standard fluid management. There were no significant differences in demographic characteristics between groups. The infants who received fluid supplementation had a significantly larger decline in the total serum bilirubin level per day and a shorter phototherapy duration ( P < .01). There were no significant differences in weight ( P = .14), or sodium ( P = .79) change per day or the need for exchange transfusion between groups. The prematurity-related inhospital morbidities were similar between groups.Fluid supplementation in preterm infants receiving conventional phototherapy resulted in a faster decline in the bilirubin level and a shorter duration of phototherapy, without increasing prematurity-related morbidities. Future randomized controlled trials to assess the benefits and risks of fluid supplementation during conventional phototherapy in preterm infants are needed.",

    "abstract": "Implementing innovative approaches to vascular access can be challenging in the newborn intensive care unit (NICU).The purpose of this project was to describe the implementation of extended dwell peripheral intravenous (EPIV) catheters, a vascular access device not widely used in the NICU. The implementation involved (1) designing clinical criteria for EPIV catheter use, (2) education of vascular access NICU nurses, and (3) comparing clinical outcomes between vascular access devices (ie, PIV and EPIV catheters).We developed evidence-based clinical criteria guiding the use of vascular access devices. We then developed an educational plan for NICU nurses focused on vascular access. Finally, we collected and compared demographic characteristics and clinical data on catheter type and placement attempts, dwell time, and clinical complications associated with each catheter.EPIV catheters were implemented according to evidence-based criteria by a vascular access NICU nursing team. Fifteen percent of PIV catheter placements required 3 or more attempts compared with just 1% of EPIV catheter placement attempts. EPIV catheters had a longer median dwell time (3.5 vs 1 day) and fewer complications than PIV catheters (P < .001).Implementation of an evidence-based approach to vascular access by a team of NICU nurses may improve clinical outcomes. EPIV catheters may be an appropriate alternative device to PIV catheters due to fewer placement attempts, longer dwell times, and overall fewer complications during use. Future vascular access research in the NICU may include a greater focus on innovative placement strategies, optimal maintenance and infection control, and prevention of complications.",

    "abstract": "Wound assessment is a critical part of the care of hospitalized infants in neonatal intensive care. Early recognition and initiation of appropriate treatment of wounds are imperative to facilitate wound healing and avoid complications such as secondary infection and wound dehiscence. There are, however, no validated tools for assessing surgical wounds in infants.The aim of this study was to develop and interrogate a tool for the assessment of surgical wounds. Specific aims for the tool included interrater reliability (give a consistent and dependable result independent of user) and test criterion validity (give an accurate assessment of the wound compared with an expert).This was an exploratory cohort study involving a structured wound tool applied by nursing staff to 40 surgical wounds. The wounds were also assessed by wound experts (a pediatric wound care nurse and a pediatric surgeon). Comparisons were made to elucidate estimates of reliability and validity.The wound tool demonstrated interrater reliability with intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.775 (95% CI, 0.665-0.862) as well as criterion validity with rank correlation coefficient of 0.55 (95% CI, 0.34-0.76) to 0.71 (95% CI, 0.53-0.88). To obtain 100% sensitivity to distinguish mild from moderate-severe wounds, a low cutoff score was needed.Wound assessment continues to be a subjective exercise, even with the utilization of a tool. Additional research is needed for strategies to support the assessment of surgical wounds in infants. Such tools are needed for future research, particularly when multiple institutions are involved.",

    "abstract": "Background: Black infants in the United States have the highest incidence of both infant mortality (IM) and preterm birth among all racial/ethnic groups. The IM disparity for Black preterm infants often occurs after neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) discharge, when parents become the primary caregivers. The revised Kenner Transition Model (KTM) is situation specific and comprised 5 interrelated domains of parental need after NICU discharge that have not been previously applied to the transition from NICU to home of Black infants. Purpose: This study's purpose was to explore the conceptual fit of parental readiness to care for their Black preterm infants after NICU discharge with the revised KTM. Methods: A qualitative descriptive research approach was used for this single-site study of NICU parents of Black preterm infants. Qualitative analysis of 10 parents' perceptions before NICU discharge was via semantic content analysis; data were organized into categories aligned with the KTM. The Transition Questionnaire (TQ), an adjunct to the KTM, provided self- report quantitative data. Results: All parents endorsed the “Information Needs,” “Stress and Coping,” and “Professional Support” domains of the KTM. Parent TQ responses indicated perceptions of moderate to high levels of home transition readiness after NICU discharge. Implications for Practice and Research: The domains of the revised KTM were affirmed by parents of Black preterm infants in this study via coded interview and TQ responses. Additional study exploring the clinical assessment of transition readiness with theoretical grounding in diverse NICU families is warranted.

Disparities in adverse birth outcomes associated with sociodemographic factors are difficult to quantify and modify, limiting their usefulness in assessing intervention effects. Purpose: To test hypotheses that (1) the biological factors of maternal testosterone and cortisol are associated with sociodemographic factors and (2) both factors are associated with neonatal health and maternal mental health and healthy behaviors between birth and 40 weeks' gestational age. Methods: We used a descriptive, longitudinal design. Eighty-eight mothers and very low birth-weight neonates were recruited from a tertiary medical center in the United States. Data on sociodemographic factors and neonatal health were collected from medical records. Maternal mental health and healthy behaviors were collected with questionnaires. Maternal salivary testosterone and cortisol levels were measured using enzyme immunoassays. Data were analyzed primarily using general linear and mixed models. Results: High testosterone and/or low cortisol levels were associated with younger age, less education, enrollment in a federal assistance program, being unmarried, being Black, poorer neonatal health, and delayed physical growth. Low cortisol level was related to higher levels of depressive symptoms. Black mothers had fewer healthy behaviors than White mothers. Implications for Practice and Research: Findings confirm that biological factors are associated with sociodemographic factors, and both are associated with neonatal health and maternal mental health and healthy behaviors. We propose using sociodemographic and biological factors concurrently to identify risk and develop and evaluate ante- and postpartum interventions.

Swaddling has positive effects on pain and stress responses, state regulation, and physiological stability in preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Swaddling during bottle feeding may support preterm infant behavioral organization and oral feeding skills. Swaddling is used inconsistently during feeding in the NICU and has not been critically examined for effects on bottle feeding performance in preterm infants. Purpose: To examine the effects of swaddling on bottle feeding quality and efficiency in preterm infants. Methods: A convenience sample of 30 infants born before 34 weeks of gestation was selected in an urban level IV NICU. Using an experimental, randomized crossover design, each infant was swaddled for one feeding and unswaddled for one feeding. Feeding efficiency was measured by rate and volume consumed. Feeding quality was examined by the Early Feeding Skills Assessment and frequency of physiological changes. Data were analyzed using dependent t tests and Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results: When swaddled, participants demonstrated significantly better scores on all related subtests of the Early Feeding Skills Assessment ( P ≤ .001). Infants demonstrated no difference in frequency of bradycardia or oxygen desaturations greater than 4 seconds. No significant differences were found in feeding efficiency outcomes. Implications for Practice and Research: Swaddling can be used in the NICU to improve bottle feeding quality in preterm infants. Future investigation is needed on long-term effects of swaddling during bottle feeding on feeding performance, weight gain, and length of stay.",

There is a paucity of literature regarding LM use in high-resource countries; however, anecdotal information and recent studies suggest low implementation.This article increases awareness of LM safety and efficacy, provides guidance for determining nursing scope of practice, and includes suggestions for developing a training program.Methods include considering NRP customers' questions, recent systematic reviews of the literature, how NRP recommendations are developed, how to determine nursing scope of practice, and how to develop a training program.Recent studies support the NRP recommendation to use the LM as a rescue airway when PPV fails and intubation is not feasible. The LM provides more effective PPV than face-mask ventilation. The LM may be effective as the initial PPV device for infants of at least 34 weeks' gestation. To use the LM, nurses may require training, which may include a simulation-based curriculum.Nurses can increase their awareness of the advantages of LM use, determine their scope of practice, and develop a training program. When face-mask ventilation is unsuccessful and intubation is unfeasible, LM insertion will likely increase the newborn's heart rate and avoid intubation.Future research should determine training requirements, efficacy of the LM as the initial PPV device in high-resource settings, and LM use during complex resuscitation and in preterm newborns.",

    "abstract": "Background: Although developmental supportive care is an effective approach to improve the long-term psychomotor and/or neurobehavioral function of preterm infants, very limited studies have focused on the impact of after-discharge developmental support. The underlying epigenetic changes are unclear. Purpose: This study aimed to explore the preliminary effect of an evidence-based Postdischarge Developmental Support Program (PDSP) on preterm infant neurodevelopment and underlying epigenetic changes, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene-related DNA methylation and expression. Methods: In this randomized controlled pilot trial, the preterm infant-parent dyads were randomized into either the intervention group/PDSP group (n = 22) or the control group/usual care group (n = 22). The neurodevelopmental outcomes of preterm infants were measured by Ages &amp; Stages Questionnaires. Urine BDNF concentration level was tested by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Infant saliva specimens were collected to analyze the methylation level of BDNF gene promoter I at pre- and postintervention test. Results: After PDSP intervention, the total neurodevelopmental and the 5 domain scores of the PDSP group were all significantly higher than those of the control group ( P &lt; .05). The BDNF levels decreased significantly only within control group ( P = .01). The difference in BDNF concentration and methylation levels between groups was not statistically significant. Implications for Practice and Research: Postdischarge Developmental Support Program may promote the neurodevelopment of preterm infants but has no effect on BDNF's expression and gene methylation level at 3 months of corrected age. The epigenetic mechanism of PDSP needs further study using a larger sample and longer follow-up.",

The purpose of this article is to present a detailed case study demonstrating how one NNP group used a 4-phase strategic planning process to turn a crisis into an opportunity. The article describes data obtained during the strategic planning process from an informal national survey of NNP managers that focused on key benchmarks, such as role definition, responsibilities, protected nonclinical time, NNP salary and benefits, and educational and professional development support. Using the strategic planning process, the group defined mutually agreed upon minimum safe staffing levels for NNPs, interns, residents and neonatologists in their setting. Based on the data generated, the group successfully justified additional NNP positions and organizational support for 10% protected nonclinical time. A sample operational budget, comparison of 3 staffing scenarios, and a timeline are also provided.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND For preterm infants and infants who have difficulty with oral feeding, excessive drooling during oral feedings can result in inaccurate assessment of intake. The drooled volume is typically estimated by visual and tactile assessment of the bib. Research, however, has demonstrated that visual assessment is inaccurate. PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of a scale that was used for the test weighing of milk that was drooled during a study of oral feeding for preterm infants. Additionally, the effect of weighing solutions with different densities on the accuracy of test weights was examined. METHOD Descriptive, comparative design. PROCEDURES A simulated feeding situation was performed using 3 fluids (water, Enfamil20, and Enfamil24) and 3 volume ranges (1 mL to 10 mL, 11 mL to 20 mL, and 21 mL to 30 mL). Data collection sessions were conducted for each of the 3 fluids using each range of volumes, for a total of 180 test weights. The research assistant performing the test weights was blinded to the preweight of the bib and the amount of fluid being applied to the bib. RESULTS Differences between the actual volume applied to the bib and the volume estimated by the scale were very small, with 51% of the differences equaling 0 mL and 48% of the differences between −1 mL and 1 mL. There were significant differences in errors related to both the type of fluid (F = 25.7; df = 2; P < 0.001) and volume range (F = 12.7; df = 2; P < 0.001), as well as for the interaction between the 2 factors (F = 7.02; df = 4; P < 0.001). Water had significantly less mean error than either formula, and large volumes had significantly greater mean error than either small or medium volumes. CONCLUSIONS Test weighing is an accurate method for measuring fluids of different densities and volumes in a simulation of drooling during oral feeding. The increased error with larger volumes of higher density solutions was not clinically significant. The study supports the need to consider both the accuracy of the scale and characteristics of the fluid when test weighing is used to measure volumes of fluids.",

Current recommendations support nonpharmacologic treatments for this population of infants. Multimodal (motion, sound) seats are often employed to soothe infants.The purpose of this study was to survey neonatal intensive care unit nurses on their practices regarding the use of a motion/sound infant seat.Sixty-six nurses (52% of 126 total nurses) completed the survey about their self-disclosed practices that included (1) reasons for use; (2) rationale for choice of settings of motion and sound; (3) duration of time infants spent in seat in one session; (4) perception of positive infant response; (5) who places infants in the seat; and (6) nursing instructions dispensed prior to use.Chief reasons for use were infant state, lack of persons to hold infants, and a diagnosis of neonatal abstinence syndrome. Rationale for choice of motion and sound settings included trial and error, prior settings, personal preferences/patterns, assumptions, and random selection. Nurse responses regarding the amount of time the infant was placed in the seat in a single session ranged from 10 to 360 minutes, with determining factors of infant cues, sleeping, feeding, and someone else to hold the infant.As nonpharmacologic treatments evolve, nurses need guidelines for safe, effective interventions to care for infants.Further research is necessary to ascertain the responses of withdrawing infants and to establish guidelines and education for use of the motion/sound infant seat.",

    "abstract": "Any maternal history of blood loss, ABO or Rh incompatibility, and hydrops fetalis often leads to suspicion of neonatal anemia postnatally. When maternal history consists only of decreased fetal movement, recognition of neonatal anemia can be problematic.This case was a transported late preterm neonate who presented initially with persistent hypoxia unresponsive to usual respiratory support. On examination, mild paleness was noted.Anemia caused by fetal-maternal hemorrhage was the ultimate diagnosis confirmed by a Kleihauer-Betke test on maternal serum examining fetal cells.Neonatal resuscitation included positive pressure ventilation, oxygen, and intubation. However, oxygenation did not improve prompting consultation with the neonatologist. Sedation and a paralytic were given. A chest radiograph ruled out pneumothoraces and pleural effusions as causative. Initiation of inhaled nitric oxide produced a mild response. Eventually, the transport nurse obtained a complete blood count indicating severe anemia, which prompted an emergent blood transfusion. The accepting neonatology team consulted with the obstetrician and a Kleihauer-Betke test was performed on mother's blood confirming a large fetal-maternal hemorrhage.This neonate responded well to blood transfusions, a pressor, and respiratory support and was discharged home at 7 days of life.Recognition of postnatal anemia is vital to sustaining life and this can occur in the transport environment. When maternal history is nonspecific and a neonate is hypoxic, uncommon causes of hypoxia can be identified with consultation and a complete blood count.",

    "abstract": "Background: In 2017, the Nebraska Unicameral passed legislative bill 506, which required physicians to inform patients carrying fetuses diagnosed with a life-limiting anomaly of the option to enroll in a comprehensive perinatal hospice program. The bill also required the Department of Health &amp; Human Services to provide information about statewide hospice programs. Families enrolled in hospice programs are better prepared for the birth and death of their child. This large academic medical center was listed on the registry but did not have a formal perinatal hospice program. Purpose: Implementation of a comprehensive perinatal hospice program. Methods: The program was designed and implemented, beginning with the formation of an interdisciplinary team. Guidelines were developed for program referral, care conferences, team communication, and family follow-up. The team was educated. Electronic record documentation and order set were implemented. A data collection process was developed to track referrals and critical data points. Results: The perinatal hospice program has been accepting referrals but has not had any qualifying referrals. Implications for Practice: The development of an evidence-based guideline for referral that can improve referral consistency. While trisomy 13 and 18 diagnosis was historically considered life-limiting, these families now have the option of full intervention and transfer for specialists. Implications for Research: Future research will include collecting data from patients who could have benefited from hospice, including infants who were born 20 to 22 weeks, or for maternal reasons. Future research will evaluate the experience after bereavement, the hospice team's experience, and the effectiveness of the referral process.",

However, preterm birth is associated with less positive mother–infant interactions than full-term birth. Malawi has the highest preterm birth rate in the world, but studies of the mother–infant relationship in Malawi are limited and studies that observed mother–infant interactions could not be located. Purpose: This study explored mother–infant interactions among Malawian mothers of early-preterm, late-preterm, and full-term infants. Methods: This observational study explored maternal and infant interactive behaviors. We recruited 83 mother–infant dyads (27 early-preterm, 29 late-preterm, and 27 full-term dyads). Findings: Mothers of early-preterm infants looked at and rocked their infants less, and their infants looked at their mothers less, than mothers of either late-preterm infants or full-term infants. The infants in all groups were asleep most of the time, which contributed to low levels of interactive behaviors. Factors that were related to infant behaviors included marital status, maternal occupation, maternal education, infant medical complications, infant gender, history of neonatal deaths, and multiple births. Implications for Practice: Our findings provide evidence about the need to encourage mothers to engage interactive behaviors with their infants. Implications for Research: Future studies of factors that contribute to positive interactions in Malawi are needed.",

    "abstract": "Background: Chest tube placement is an important skill for providers and bedside nurses caring for critically ill infants, allowing for the evacuation of pleural fluid and pneumothoraces. No realistic simulation models are commercially available for trainees to practice and learn this skill on infants. Purpose: Our objective was to develop an inexpensive and reproducible model for percutaneous pleural pigtail placement for pleural fluid removal via the Seldinger technique. Methods: The model was developed using hardware material and a discarded infant resuscitation manikin. The rib cage was constructed using electrical cable wires. Discarded and expired 250-mL bags of intravenous fluids were placed inside the chest cavity to simulate pleural fluid. Shelf liner was wrapped around the chest and abdomen of the infant model to simulate the skin layer. Pediatric critical care faculty performed the procedure on the final model and scored it for realism and utility for teaching. Without including the discarded manikin and fluid bags, the cost of the materials for the model was less than $20. Results: Eight pediatric critical care faculty tested the pleural pigtail placement model. All faculty agreed the model provides a realistic simulated reproduction of placing a pleural pigtail, felt the model was simple to use, and indicated they would use it as a teaching tool in the future. Implications for Practice: An effective model for pleural pigtail placement can be inexpensively constructed using discarded bags of intravenous fluid and easy-to-find hardware materials. Implications for Research: Future studies are needed to assess whether this model helps providers and nurses develop and maintain the clinical skills for successful percutaneous pleural pigtail catheter placement.

    "abstract": "Background: Nasogastric (NG) tubes are used in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for various indications. However, evidence of the best practice for estimating the NG tube insertion length in extremely low birth-weight (ELBW) infants is limited. Purpose: To determine a weight-based estimation formula of NG tube length in ELBW infants. Methods: This prospective study was performed at a single-center level III neonatal intensive care unit. Low birth-weight infants admitted between May 2009 and May 2010 who required radiography for clinical reasons were included. Radiographs of participants whose current body weights (BWs) were less than 2500 g were reviewed, and the appropriate ideal insertion length of the NG tube adjusted based on radiographs and the infant's current BW was assessed. A regression model was used to determine the ideal insertion length of the NG tube with respect to the current BW. Results: Overall, 533 radiographs (152 patients weighing 422-2486 g) were analyzed. Among the patients, 246 had BWs less than 1000 g and 287 had BWs more than 1000 g. Formulas that predicted NG tube length (centimeters) were derived as follows: (5 × weight [kg] + 10 [BW &lt; 1.0 kg]) or (3 × weight [kg] + 12.5 [1.0 &lt; BW &lt;2.5 kg]). Implications for Practice: The application of the weight-based formula for estimating the NG tube length derived from the present study together with commonly used morphological methods may improve the accuracy of the NG tube insertion procedure in ELBW infants. Implications for Research: Further studies in other cohorts are needed.",

Additionally, few studies have detailed referral triggers that are specific to the mother, infant, or pregnancy for inclusion in perinatal and neonatal palliative and supportive care programs. Purpose: The purpose of this retrospective, descriptive study was to examine the sociodemographic factors and referral triggers for perinatal-neonatal palliative and supportive care services for women enrolled in a newly developed perinatal-neonatal palliative and supportive care program. Methods: Data were collected from medical records of 135 women enrolled in the program. Triggers for referral to the program were classified as fetal, maternal, or prenatal complications. Results: A diverse sample of women were enrolled in the program. Most infants survived to birth and discharge from the hospital. Two-thirds of referrals were related to infant complications and 34% were for multiple complications (fetal, maternal, and/or prenatal). Triggers for referral to the program were not related to sociodemographic characteristics of women. Implications for Practice: A comprehensive list of triggers that include maternal and prenatal complications, in addition to infant complications, may ensure at-risk women and infants, are enrolled in perinatal-neonatal palliative and supportive care programs early in pregnancy, regardless of sociodemographic factors. Implications for Research: Prospective research on the effectiveness of perinatal-neonatal palliative and supportive care programs in diverse populations of women is needed. This includes the examination of family health outcomes and provider perspectives.",

    "abstract": "Background: Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is characterized by significant physiological and behavioral signs involving multiple-organ systems in neonates following a prenatal exposure to opioids and other nonopioid drugs. Neonatal abstinence syndrome can result in serious morbidity, and even death, if unrecognized and untreated. The purpose of this study was to develop a simulation model of a standard video training of the Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring System (FNAS) and investigate the perceptions of comfort and competency of pediatric residents undergoing video or simulation training. Methods: Thirty-one pediatric and medicine-pediatric residents participated in this single-blinded randomized intervention study. The experimental group completed demonstrated simulation while the control group received the traditional video instruction. Both groups completed FNAS scoring on a case of a neonate with NAS. The FNAS scores of residents were compared with the scores of 2 expert raters. Pre- and posttraining and preference surveys were obtained from all participants. Results: Both experimental and control groups scored the FNAS scenario similarly and were also similar to the expert raters. Both groups also reported comparable levels of comfort and competency after the training, though first-year residents reported greater improvement than upper-level residents. The FNAS scores from expert raters were identical for the simulation and video scenarios. Implications for Practice: Although this study showed that a simulation training module can be used as a standardized teaching method to administer the FNAS, it can be cost-prohibitive and daunting to produce. Nursing professionals need to be aware of medical education training around FNAS due to the interdisciplinary nature of care for neonates with NAS. Institutions should consider implementing a diversity of practices and models with an interdisciplinary approach to training assessment of the neonate with NAS. Implications for Research: A more hands-on, less cost-prohibitive simulation training needs to be developed to teach FNAS administration with a broader range of professionals including interdisciplinary teams of nursing and medical professionals.",

However, the specific goals of parents are often unaddressed by the healthcare team. The aim of this study was to understand the goals of parents whose infant was in the NICU to enhance collaboration and communication between parents and health professionals. Methods: A written questionnaire was disseminated to parents whose infant was in the NICU at the Kingston Health Sciences Centre. A thematic analysis of the goals was completed to identify key emergent themes and their implications. Results: A total of 23 questionnaires were disseminated to parents and 13 (57%) were returned. Returned questionnaires were most often completed by the mother (n = 9, 70%), and a total of 40 goals were recorded. Three key emergent themes were identified, which included feeding and weight gain, eliminating medical equipment, and successful hospital discharge. Implications for Practice: Understanding the goals of parents whose infant was in the NICU can enhance communication between parents and their healthcare team, thus aiding the implementation of a family-centered practice. Implications for Research: Future larger sample sizes studies across several NICUs would increase the generalizability of results and garner a larger volume of data to establish significant trends between specific infant and parent demographic data and the associated goals.",

    "abstract": "The admission of a newborn infant to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) due to preterm birth or high-risk conditions, such as perinatal injury, sepsis, hypoxia, congenital malformation, or brain injury, is a stressful experience for mothers. There is currently a lack of research on maternal perceived stress and support in Egyptian NICUs and no validated Arabic tool to investigate this further.To determine the reliability and validity of the Arabic language versions of the Parental Stressor Scale: NICU (PSS:NICU) and the Nurse Parental Support Tool (NPST).Egyptian mothers completed the PSS:NICU and the NPST at the time of their infants' discharge from the NICU. Reliability was assessed with Cronbach α and Spearman-Brown coefficient. The multifactorial structure of the PSS:NICU Arabic version was tested. Associations with sociodemographic and clinical variables were explored with bivariate correlations and t tests.Sixty-eight mothers of preterm (PT) infants and 52 mothers of ill full-term (IFT) infants completed the study. Mothers of PT and IFT infants did not differ for sociodemographic variables. High internal consistency (α range between .93 and .96) emerged for both tools. Spearman-Brown coefficients ranged between 0.86 and 0.94. The multidimensional structure of the PSS:NICU was confirmed and 3 core dimensions explained up to 71.48% of the variance. Perceived nursing support did not diminish the effects of stress in mothers of infants admitted to the NICU, regardless of PT or IFT infants' status. A longer NICU stay was associated with greater stress in mothers of PT infants. The presence of comorbidities was significantly associated with stress of mothers of IFT infants.Future research is needed to develop evidence-based support for mothers whose infants are admitted to a NICU in Egypt. The availability of validated and reliable PSS:NICU and NPST scales in Arabic will facilitate cross-country and cross-cultural research on maternal stress in the NICU.Neonatal care nurses in Egypt will be able to increase their understanding of the stressors experienced by mothers of infants admitted to the NICU. This will in turn enable the introduction of neonatal care policies aimed at reducing specific stressors and provide improved maternal support.",

Proximal temperature was measured using a humidity heat transmitter. The humidifier temperature was set at 38°C (temperature I) and then at 39°C (temperature II).The mean proximal temperatures were significantly lower than the values set in the humidifier (33.8 ± 1.20°C at temperature I, and 34.06 ± 1.30°C at temperature II, P < .001). However, the difference between the 2 proximal temperatures was not significant (P = .162). The incubator temperature was found to be effective on the proximal gas temperature (P < .05). It was found that only preterm infants in the temperature II group had a higher mean heart rate (P < .05).Incubator temperatures may have an effect on inspired gas temperature in preterm infants who are mechanically ventilated and caregivers should be aware of these potentially negative effects.Future studies should focus on how to measure the temperature and humidity of gas reaching infants in order to prevent heat and humidity losses.",

Implications for Practice: The initial approach for the neonatal practitioner needs to focus on various aspects of the newborn's care, including medical stabilization, determining whether immediate laboratory or imaging studies are needed, careful physical examination with particular attention to detail, appropriate and timely communication with the family, and knowledge of various specific aspects of rare diseases. Implications for Research: More research is needed to better understand how to best support the newborn born with dysmorphia or a rare disease. Particular attention needs to be focused on strategies to best support the family who is often in crisis during the neonatal period.",

It is imperative that these infants undergo diagnostic testing, which includes genetic, neonatal fasting study to induce hypoglycemia, glucagon stimulation, and imaging. Once a diagnosis has been made, surgical intervention may be needed to help regulate blood glucose levels. During this diagnostic process and as the infant is undergoing treatment, there may be little concern for the mother's feeding plan. Because human milk is the preferred form of nutrition for all infants, these mothers should receive prenatal counseling regarding the initiation and maintenance of milk supply.

    "abstract": "The amount of literature one must sift through to be well informed is overwhelming to even the most seasoned of writers. However, to really understand the issues surrounding care in the high-risk environment of the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), one must have a sense of the scope and quality of the information available for our decision making. “How does one keep abreast of literature and research that we should use to guide our practice when we are all so busy providing the care?” This is a common struggle we hear all the time. Most everyone complains that there is no time to search the literature, let alone read it all. As evidence-based practice becomes more routinely integrated into care, systematically searching the literature is essential to making informed clinical decisions even if one does not intend to write a manuscript for publication. To uncover the evidence and get the most unbiased sense of what is already known about a particular caregiving intervention or strategy requires a defined literature searching method. Why we choose to provide the care we deliver is important. Therefore, we should not make caregiving decisions based on what we have “always done” but rather on what is the best strategy that will lead to the best outcomes. When there is now so much literature to search and so many databases to search in, “where should I start?” and “how do I get a quick answer?” are questions we hear often. Searching the literature today is definitely not for the faint of heart, but it can be simplified with a few targeted strategies. In 2012, McGrath et al1 published an article about best searching practices. We will quickly outline several steps here but also ask you to refer to that article for more details about the process (see Table). Searching the literature begins with asking a discrete question. Searching also takes time but with a little forethought and planning it does get easier. If your search question is too broad or vague, the search will not yield the answers you are looking to find. The “PICOT” question has been used to guide much of evidence-based practice.2 PICOT is an acronym that outlines a strategy for designing the question to guide your search with P = population of interest; I = intervention or caregiving practice of concern; C = the comparison caregiving practice (eg, receiving surfactant vs not receiving surfactant); O = desired outcome, and T = time (eg, in the newborn period). Using this formula for designing your question before you search will make the searching process more streamlined.TABLE. Five: Systematic Steps to Refine the Search ProcessaOnce you have your question, you need to consider which library databases to use for your search. The choice will depend on the search question but for most clinically related search questions it will be essential to include PubMed and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) and a few others. Sometimes beginning with a “keyword” search in PubMed will help you uncover the best “keywords” and MESH terms to use but you cannot stop there—“keyword” searches are very limited.3 If individuals use a different word or term to denote the same concept, an individual “keyword” search will not retrieve the same articles because keyword searches only hunt for exact matches of the words you type into the search window. MESH terms are root terms used in PubMed and CINHAL (subject headings) to link similar concepts together so that better searching occurs.3–5 MESH terms are more comprehensive because the root terms will connect all the different terms together within the database. Using MESH terms and subject headings will provide you the best way to define and refine your search strategy.4–6 As you complete your search, it is important to evaluate your results along the way. Constant appraisal of your literature search will allow you to understand whether you need to increase or broaden the focus of your question. Evaluate and refine your search until you are able to answer your question. Your literature search could yield very little evidence; however, before you make clinical decisions4–6 on limited evidence, consult a medical librarian. We include librarians in our work on a regular basis, because they understand how databases work and are more skilled at how best to complete a comprehensive search.1,4–6 As the number of published articles and journals continues to grow, it is more important to know how and when to work with a librarian. Your time with the librarian will be most informative if you go with a well-formulated question and a potential list of search terms. More detailed tips about working with a librarian are provided in the article by McGrath et al.1 Some librarians now have created forms to help you prepare for your search and to think systematically about the searching process.1 We will end by briefly discussing reference management software. For those who write on a regular basis about or around the same topic, using referencing software can be very beneficial. Referencing software creates a database of the references you retrieve from the library that you can then use to write your manuscript. An advantage of using the software is that the references can easily be added in your manuscript text and the reference list can be created through the software at the end of the manuscript. However, there are also some disadvantages. Not all journals use the same formula for developing the reference to be downloaded into your software, so you may still need to make corrections in your reference list or add missing data to your database. Thus, even with referencing software, you will need to spend some time cleaning up the references, and it is best to do this in within the reference entries so you will preserve the changes for later use. For example, you may need to make sure that the titles of the journals are abbreviated appropriately or typed out in full, depending on the manuscript style of the journal where you are planning to publish the article. For Advances in Neonatal Care, we use the American Medical Association (AMA) manuscript style, which means the journal titles will all be abbreviated. However, many nursing schools and other journals use American Psychological Association (APA) manuscript style in which the journal titles are fully spelled out. To manage referencing issues, many medical libraries now have the RefWorks software (RefWorks, Bethesda, Maryland) available to users for free.7RefWorks has improved significantly over the past few years and is great for writers who are developing a single manuscript. The software is usually available through the library and easily articulates with the databases.7 One disadvantage of this software is that the database is not a file you can save yourself on your computer for later use in another referencing management system. You can save your database of references within the RefWorks online system through the library, but you cannot personally own the software. As such, your reference files are only stored within their online system so the work you do putting your files together is not easily transferrable. For those authors who are planning to write and publish on a regular basis, we suggest using either EndNote or Reference Manager.8,9 These 2 reference managing software systems are fairly comparable and thus, we will not recommend one over the other (interestingly, both are associated with the Thompson Corporation). Individuals who write with some frequency become comfortable with one of these managing software systems and over time build their personal reference databases in one of these 2 systems. Each software package can read the other's files so if you decide to switch software you can move your reference lists into the other software system at a later time. The reference files stored within this software become a database or repository of references. References can easily be downloaded directly from the library databases. Files can also be attached within the database, such as the PDF of the article or a table or picture. The ability to sort, search, and continue to refine the references stored is an advantage of these systems. As researchers who publish regularly, we cannot imagine functioning without these databases because for us they simplify the writing process. However, there is a time and cost (unless your institution provides for free) investment involved in the use of these systems; therefore, we would not recommend quickly making the investment. Try RefWorks first; it is typically free in medical libraries to registered users. See how the software works for you and as you become a more prolific writer or researcher invest in a reference managing system. You may also want to consider the software system your writing team is already using so you are all working together in the same environment. Searching is not for the faint of heart and does take time but the time investment will make the work you do more meaningful. No search is easy; therefore, we end with an old adage, “Garbage in Garbage out.” Investing your time in searching just makes sense for good decision-making in the clinical setting.",

To ensure safe procedures for these vulnerable patients, practical planning and surveillance are paramount. Purpose: This systematic review summarizes and evaluates the literature reporting on practical planning to maintain required safety for premature infants undergoing MRI. Methods: Literature identified through various search strategies was screened, abstracted, appraised, and synthesized through a descriptive analysis. Thirteen research studies, 2 quality improvement projects, and 10 other documents, including practice guidelines, general reviews and articles, a book chapter, and an editorial article, were retained for in-depth review. Conclusions: Various procedures and equipment to ensure the safety of premature infants during MRI have been developed and tested. Although the results are promising and increasingly consistent, our review suggests that more research is needed before conclusive recommendations for the use of magnetic resonance–compatible incubators, the “feed-and-sleep” approach to avoid sedation, or the specific noise-cancelling ear protection for the premature infants' safety during MRI can be established.",

    "abstract": "While taking the plunge as a first-time or experienced author, when you submit your manuscript to a journal, you feel a sense of relief and anticipation. Although manuscripts are seldom accepted on the first submission, every author wonders whether their manuscript will be accepted and what revisions will be required along the way. Most of us still remember the first set of reviewer comments we received and strive to provide thoughtful feedback to improve each manuscript we review. To facilitate high-quality manuscript submissions and thoughtful reviews, Advances in Neonatal Care's editorial board plans to revise our guidelines for both authors and reviewers over the next 6 months. We welcome new authors and reviewers and are willing to provide mentorship for the novice. In this editorial, we outline our review process, a reviewer's responsibilities, and the author's responsibility to respond to reviewer concerns. THE REVIEW PROCESS The purpose of the review process is to expose the scholarly work to expert review. For our journal, the process begins with the submission of the manuscript to ANC Editorial Manger. The managing editor makes certain that the author has submitted all of the required components of the submission. If the submission is incomplete, the managing editor will return the submission to the author through ANC Editorial Manager to add the missing items. All manuscripts are reviewed by 2 to 3 blinded external reviewers, a section editor responsible for the specific ANC section (eg, Beyond the Basics, Research), and a coeditor. In general, review of manuscripts includes the following steps: Author submits a manuscript to Editorial Manger. Managing editor assigns the manuscript to one of the ANC coeditors. Responsible ANC coeditor assigns reviewers to the manuscript. Reviewers review the manuscript. Coeditor assigns a section editor to the manuscript. Section editor reviews the manuscript and reviewers comments. Section editor makes a recommendation (accept, accept pending revisions, revise, reject) Coeditor makes the final decision. Author is contacted with the decision. REVIEWER RESPONSIBILITIES Reviewers play an essential role in safeguarding the integrity of our clinical and research scholarship. The first responsibility of reviewers is to ensure that they have the relevant expertise to provide a thoughtful review.1 As coeditors, we attempt to assign reviewers to manuscripts based on the reviewers' self-declared areas of expertise within the Editorial Manager system, but only the reviewer can make a true assessment of the fit of their expertise with a particular manuscript. Therefore, before accepting the assignment, each reviewer has an opportunity to view the manuscript to determine if the content matches their knowledge base. Even if the content matches a reviewer's area of expertise, the reviewer may decline an assignment if they cannot complete the review in the required timeframe. Typically reviewers are given 2 to 3 weeks to complete a review assignment to facilitate a timely response to authors.2 However, if you are willing to accept a review assignment if given additional time, please check with the editor. Reviewers of articles for ANC report that they typically take 3 to 6 hours to complete a review. ANC offers continuing medical education credit to all reviewers when the review is completed to help compensate for the time they dedicate to the profession. When accepting an invitation to review a manuscript, the reviewer should assess for any potential conflicts of interest. For example, you may recognize the article as one written by a colleague or you may have a financial connection to some aspect of the article content. Any potential conflicts should be shared with the editor when accepting the assignment so that the editor can assess whether a true conflict exists.1 Most editors value reviews that provide authors with constructive suggestions to improve the manuscript, outlining the strengths and weaknesses in a positive encouraging tone.3 We encourage reviewers to enumerate their suggestions so the authors can clearly address each reviewer's concern in the response to the editor. Reviewers will also make recommendations regarding whether manuscripts should be accepted or not, and if accepted, how quickly the manuscript should be published based on the urgency of the content. Once you complete your review and submit it via ANC Editorial Manager, you can go back into the system and see the comments of other reviewers. This is a great learning opportunity to see how your comments and recommendations compare to those of the other reviewers. In addition, you will receive blinded copies of the letters we send to the author about the review process so you will know how manuscripts you review progress through the publication process. We want the process to be as transparent as possible so both authors and reviewers know what to expect. One of our long-term goals is to improve the process so that we are able to shorten the time from submission to publication for all manuscripts coming to ANC; everyone (authors, reviewers, editorial board members, section editors, and coeditors) plays an important part in this process. RESPONDING TO REVIEWER CONCERNS Thinking back to that first set of reviewers' comments we each received, we also received good advice from our mentors. They provided several suggestions. First, all reviews are good reviews, you just may not be ready to hear them yet, and second with persistence almost any manuscript will be published. Last, if the review seems harsh, read it, close it, and leave it alone for a few days; not more than a week and then go back and read it again. Do not give up. Persistence is the key to writing and getting what you write disseminated so that others can share in your knowledge. If you respond to all of the author concerns in your first revision, a second revision should not be necessary or should include only minor edits that were missed during the first review. To respond to reviewers' recommendations or concerns, we first recommend establishing a table or a numbered list of each individual concern. This table will help you organize your thoughts and will be included in your cover letter to the editor when you resubmit your manuscript. Second, you should review each comment and make note of your ability to address the concern. Next, make all necessary revisions to your manuscript. Last, go back to your table and specifically state how you addressed each reviewer concern or recommendation. In your response, make sure to include where in the manuscript the changes (eg, discussion) were made. There may be some suggestions for manuscript improvement that are not feasible. For example, in a research manuscript the data requested by the reviewer may not have been collected and therefore cannot be included in your revision. Make sure you include the rationale for any reviewer recommendations that were not accepted. In your resubmission cover letter you want to thank the reviewers for their time and expertise and include your point-by-point response to their recommendations. The Editor will use this table to assess your response to the reviewer concerns. If you are not a reviewer for ANC and would like to become one, please let us know. If you are a current author or reviewer with questions or concerns, please let us know. Scholarly writing is not easy; however, being a reviewer will help you improve your writing skills, so please consider this opportunity to give back to others. We welcome feedback and suggestions as we develop our new guidelines for both authors and reviewers. Thank you for your support.",

    "abstract": "In this editorial, we expand on our newly revised author guidelines to provide information essential to research dissemination (http://edmgr.ovid.com/anc/accounts/ifauth.htm). However, if you are wondering about the differences between research, quality improvement, and evidence-based practice manuscript preparation we encourage you to read “Preparing quality improvement, research, and evidence-based practice manuscripts” by Oermann and colleagues.1 There is a table in this article that is extremely helpful in comparing and contrasting the differences between these three different types of manuscripts and project designs. ARE RESEARCH FINDINGS ALWAYS WORTHY OF PUBLICATION? YES! For many of us, conducting research is about answering a question that is important to our clinical practice. We are driven by a desire to positively impact the lives of the infants and families we interact with daily. Yet with the answers to our questions in hand, we often lack the enthusiasm or experience to disseminate our findings to others. Research findings are rarely exactly what we expect which leads many of us to think that the work is not important enough to disseminate. However if you begin your research with a well-designed study, this assumption is far from the truth. Knowledge is built on the lessons learned from others about what works and does not work. Whether your findings are as expected, not as expected, or inconclusive, it is our ethical responsibility to disseminate our findings to advance the knowledge of the discipline. Conducting research is just not enough; for the research to have meaning and influence on the science and caregiving arena, it must be shared. GETTING STARTED Unlike other articles that require time to formulate an outline, you will likely already have your research manuscript outline completed from the prior work you completed in planning your research study. In addition, you may have a draft of many sections to the manuscript that were part of your Institutional Review Board (IRB) documents that you can use to begin to fill in the content of specific sections of a research manuscript. As you use content from research planning documents, make sure you change your verbs from future to past tense. In addition, if you have previously published parts of your study, you will need to make sure that you do not self-plagiarize your work. You will need to make this new manuscript unique, even if there are shared data and/or shared data points. MANUSCRIPT SECTIONS While some of the terms for the manuscript headings may differ (findings vs results), most journals use similar research manuscript sections and can be determined by reviewing the journal's author guidelines. Below we describe the content within each section using Advances in Neonatal Care's research format. Each section will occur in the order that it appears in the manuscript, but not necessarily in the order that it should be written. Manuscript Title. The title of research manuscripts should convey the study design and problem to be addressed such as “Prevalence of Skin Breakdown During the First Week of Life in Extremely Low Birth Weight Infants,” and “Nonpharmacological Interventions Following Surgical Procedures: A Prospective Observational Study.” Always revisit any preliminary title at the completion of your article to make sure it describes your work. The title is very important as those searching the literature may not read or include your study in their review of the literature if the title does not seem to fit. This is also true of what you include in the abstract. Abstract. While the abstract is typically the first part of any manuscript to be read, it should be the last thing you write, especially in a research article. Until you have written your entire manuscript, you cannot know the most important parts to include in the abstract. The abstract should include all of the major aspects of the study under similar headings in the manuscript structure, including background, purpose, methods, results, implications for practice and implications for research. Within the methods section of the abstract include a sentence describing the study design (eg, prospective descriptive, randomized control trial) and sample size. When writing your abstract, it is also important to stay within the word limit; for ANC the word limit is 250 words. Background and Significance. The introductory material in a research manuscript provides information about the problem you are studying, seminal research to date, and the gap in the literature that your study addresses. The significant literature should be synthesized around the major findings rather than provided in a series of paragraphs describing the results of each study. In this synthesis the study designs and results are compared and contrasted to each other, and finally your study should be filling a gap not found in the previous literature. If you synthesize the literature regarding multiple outcomes of interest that are also part of your study findings, be sure to order them consistently across manuscript sections. The length of this introductory section varies depending on the study complexity and number of outcome variables explored, but typically this section should not be greater than 4 to 8 paragraphs. Often the introduction section may require modification after the results and discussion sections are completed. End this section with a clear purpose statement. If you have research hypotheses or questions they should be listed after your purpose statement. Methods. The methods section provides the roadmap for how you conducted your study and is the area for which clarity of language is most important. You want to be concise, but complete enough in the description of your methods to allow others to replicate your study. Most authors begin their research manuscripts by writing the methods section because draft content can be pulled from other study documents and it is rewarding to have some content on the page. Begin your methods section with 1 to 2 sentences that describe your study design and measures and IRB approval. Next describe your study setting and sample, including inclusion and exclusion criteria. After the setting and sample section include a section that describes every measure or instrument used for data collection including the accuracy, sensitivity, reliability and/or validity. Order the content of the measures section to match order of the variables of interest in each research question or hypothesis. Next include a procedures section that details how the study participants were recruited and consented and how and when data were collected. End the methods section with your statistical analysis plan, including how you will evaluate each research question or hypothesis. Results. Begin the results section with information about the sample's demographics and/or illness characteristics. These data are often best summarized in a paragraph, unless limited to a few variables such as age, race, and gender. When reporting summary statistics, provide a measure of central tendency (mean, mode) or percentage, the n, and range for each variable. Follow the sample information with the results for each research question or hypothesis in the same order that was used following the purpose statement. Include actual P values and statistical test parameters within the text as you describe your findings. In addition be sure to provide direction of your findings. For example, rather than stating “the infants' pain changed following the intervention,” state “the infants' pain scores decreased significantly more in the intervention group (F2,91 = 5.38, p = .006) than the control group.” As feasible, use tables and figures to display your results, but do not include summary findings in both tables and figures. For example, pain scores following an intervention may be displayed as a figure that demonstrates how the pain scores decrease over time or as a table with the mean values at each data collection time point. In this situation a figure would tell a better story than mean values with 10 time points, however the actual means down to two decimal points might also be important for others who want to better understand the study findings. For situations where the actual values may be important to others, more detailed information can be submitted as supplemental digital content. Other things to consider when reporting results are the need to include information about any outliers that were excluded from any analyses as well as any post hoc results. Do not report post hoc results as a priori. The results section is just for the results, take care NOT to include your interpretation of what the results mean in this section. Save the meaning behind your findings for the discussion section. Finally, if you had to stop or discontinue data collection based on preliminary analyses or adverse events be certain to provide the details. Discussion. The discussion section should describe how your study findings compare to other studies, highlighting significant results. If you have unexpected or nonsignificant findings explain why you think this occurred and discuss any study limitations. You will also discuss the implications of your study findings for practice and future research. After you complete your discussion extract 2 to 3 bullets to place in the ANC box “What this study adds.” The purpose of this box is to highlight for the reader the unique contribution of your study. Finally compose the content for the ANC “Summary Recommendations for Practice and Research” box. In this box you are asked to summarize your research problem in three areas: what we know, what needs to be studied, and what we can do today. The content for this box should be drawn from all of the current research, including your new results but not limited to only your results. We hope you will continue to submit your neonatal research findings to ANC, but also consider summarizing clinical issues that are important to neonatal care. In our next issue we will highlight important issues to consider when writing a clinically oriented manuscript.

    "abstract": "Authorship of a scholarly manuscript can seem like lonely business. Sitting alone in a quiet room writing for hours filling empty pages may not seem like much fun, but it does not need to be this way. Although writing alone has its place, writing alone is not always the best way to complete the work. Writing as a team can be a more efficient way to disseminate your work, whether it is an innovative approach to a clinical problem, parent teaching strategies, or a research project. A team is essential to the completion of most neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) projects, and the team can make the work of dissemination more manageable. But how do you divide and conquer the task of scholarly writing? There are several factors to consider when writing in a group. Shared authorship has benefits. Multiple perspectives from all team members can broaden the expertise of the project and provide greater depth to the content of the manuscript.1,2 Members complement each other, which is why the team successfully accomplishes the intended work that leads to development of a manuscript for publication. In addition, sharing the work of writing with a team can lead to greater (faster) progress toward completion of a manuscript. Deadlines are often better met within a group because team members do not want to let a colleague down, as opposed to wanting to extend our own personal deadlines. Yet, there are specific questions that must be addressed with multiple authors including who is in charge, who is responsible for what parts, who should get credit and for what, and how the team equitably divides the work among the members of the team. Answering these questions sometimes can be “prickly,” especially if the questions are not discussed early in the process and as openly as possible. Communication about authorship should be led by the corresponding author and should be clear and direct, and the need for documentation of the discussion should be considered. ETHICS OF AUTHORSHIP Did you know there are national standards for authorship that can be used to guide your collaborative authorship discussions and decision making? Two well-known international committees have worked to provide guidelines for authorship: the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (available at http://www.icmje.org/) and the Committee on Publication Ethics (available at http://www.publicationethics.org.uk/guidelines). Consensus of both committee recommendations states that authorship must meet 3 distinct conditions. First, each author of the manuscript must make substantial contribution to the ideas that led to the design of the project. Their contribution also could include taking an active part in project completion such as acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of the data. Second, each coauthor must either draft essential aspects of the manuscript or make significant revision to the manuscript that is critical to the final content. Each author should be able to defend the entire manuscript. For example, authorship should not be conferred when the collaborator only provided editorial revision of the manuscript. Finally, each author must approve the final version of the submitted manuscript. Journals often include this statement in their initial submission paperwork and ask all submitting authors to document that they approve the submission. Although this often is done on the first submission, many manuscripts go through revisions along the journey to publication. Therefore, even if journals do not require documentation of all authors' approval of the final revised manuscript, it is the responsibility of the corresponding author to make sure that the team is in agreement with the final product that goes to print. Remember that, for authorship to be conferred, all authors regardless of placement in the order of authorship should meet all the 3 conditions. Although these 3 conditions seem straightforward, living by them can be tricky business because what 1 author believes is substantial, active, and significant may not be seen as such by other members of the team, especially if there is already a known hierarchy in the team. Working these issues out together within a group process is as essential as meeting the 3 conditions. WHO WILL LEAD THE WRITING TEAM AND BE THE FIRST AUTHOR? Although this question is sometimes easily answered, there are other times this matter can be the biggest stumbling block to getting the work disseminated. When 2 or more people seem to have equally collaborated on a project, the issue of “first authorship” or order of authorship can be a real crux for disagreement. Authorship needs to about the responsibility for this work not about the responsibility of the general work of the team. Communication that is direct is important so that everyone on the team feels appropriately acknowledged. Usually the order of authorship is dependent on who did the most work, and thus leads the way in successful completion of the project.3 Thus, the first author would be the one taking the greatest responsibility for the project, writing the initial idea, and formulating the plan for the work. They are usually responsible for leading in decision making related to division of labor, setting timelines, and facilitating the dissemination process. Often, they are the corresponding author with the journal editor and provide the conduit between the group of editors and the publication process. Sometimes the last author is the mentor for the team, but they too need to meet the 3 conditions stated above to be considered an author on the published work.4 AUTHORSHIP CONTRACTS One way to avoid some of the pitfalls of authorship is to begin projects or collaborative relationships with authorship contracts in place. This is sometimes difficult to do, especially if publication was not considered early on in the process, but teams need to be considering publication earlier in the process. Thinking about dissemination can be helpful in bringing the work to completion because it acknowledges the work of the team. Contracts we have seen began with stating the 3 conditions previously discussed and then have space for listing each author and his or her responsibility (condition for authorship) and the order of the authors, given their degree of responsibility on the project. Using a contract reminds everyone on the team about their individual and group contributions as well as how the guidelines for authorship will be met by the team. Contracts should be openly discussed, written, and then signed by all members. Timelines can also be an aspect of the contract for the project and can be used to keep the completion of the project on track. Having a contract in place can seem very formal and may even seem awkward or in the way, but they are a way for all members to understand at the inception of the project the division of labor and expected outcomes of the work. Negotiating authorship early in the process can help everyone on the team feel that their contributions to the successful completion of the project will be appropriately acknowledged. We hope that collaborative authorship will facilitate your future scholarly work, not hinder it! Do not be afraid to draft a written contract and discuss it with your team. 2014 PARTING THOUGHTS With this issue, we end our first year as coeditors for Advances in Neonatal Care, and we want to take this opportunity to thank you for your patience as we have learned the editorial process. It has been a quick year in many ways and we are excited about our progress thus far. We have had many manuscript submissions this year. Thanks to you, our readership, we hope that you will send us even more manuscripts for review in 2015. Please do not be afraid of the process; we are here to help you through this journey. We have increased the number of active reviewers and, with these changes, the time from submission to publication has decreased. We are working to decrease this time even more by shortening the process and time that authors and reviewers have a manuscript for review within the system. We are ensuring that manuscripts are published online ahead of print on a regular basis for most accepted manuscripts so your work gets out to the readers quicker. We have also updated our author guidelines, which are now available on the journal Web site for your use. Many of the section requirements for manuscripts have changed with updating the style of our manuscripts to provide easier access to information within the manuscripts. You will see these changes in the journal beginning in 2015. Please make sure that you are aware of these changes as taking the time to following the author guidelines will help speed the review process and decrease the number of requested revisions. Revisions are important to quality manuscripts but can definitely lengthen the time to publication. As we look forward to 2015, be prepared as we have exciting changes planned. Advances in Neonatal Care was established in 2000, so this coming year is the 15th anniversary of our journal. When you see the changes within our next issue, please let us know what you think about the new formats of the manuscripts and sections; we want to hear from you and make your journal as helpful as possible in guiding your practice. Throughout the next year, we welcome your comments and hope you will communicate openly with us about what you see in these editorials and your expectations for the journal. Please consider submitting your scholarly work to Advances in Neonatal Care; we continue to be committed to supporting both new and seasoned authors. In 2015, we will be putting in place formal avenues for mentorship of new authors so please stay tuned! Hope you enjoy a happy New Year and are looking forward to 2015 as much as we are! Thank you for your support.",

    "abstract": "Dear NANN colleagues, Social media is becoming the predominant way we keep up with what is going on in the world. Maybe you don't believe this statement is true because you don't have a Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or LinkedIn account, but it is a true statement. Today, more than 65% of all adults use social media sites; this is up from only 7% in 2005.1 Newspapers, radio, and television were once the leaders in providing us the latest current events and breaking research findings that could change our lives and healthcare choices. However, today, if you want to get the scoop, you need to be connected to social media. Almost all breaking news is shared first on social media, oftentimes hours or days before it hits the television screen, radio airwaves, or newsprint. So what does this mean for scholarly publication? Publishing your work is often about getting the findings into practice. Getting the message out about your work makes what you do every day have a bigger impact than just the single infant and family who just successfully left the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). These daily successes are important, but what is more important is that the strategies and practices you use to make a difference become routine (the way we do it) so that every infant and family successfully leave the NICU. This means we need to learn from each other and continue to study and build the science of neonatal intensive care. Publishing good science in scholarly journals is important but what may be even more important is getting the scientific information into everyday communication streams. Today that is social media. This editorial outlines how best to move your scholarly work into social media outlets and how to track your success in a social media world. Marketing your scholarly work. At a recent nursing leadership conference, a presentation really sparked our interest. Dr Cindy Munro, PhD, RN, FAAN, of the University of South Florida, School of Nursing, shared how she was working with her faculty to market their research and scholarly work. The faculty were using the book Marketing for Scientists: How to Shine in Tough Times by Marc Kuchner to guide their scholarly discussions around increasing the impact of their work.2 Most of us on the frontlines of healthcare don't really think much about marketing; yet, if you are trying to get the strategies you believe will make a difference into mainstream NICU practice arenas, then marketing is important to you. This book is easy to read and provides several great examples about how to move your scholarly work into the hands of decision and policy makers who can allocate resources to take your innovative work and make it available to others. Interestingly, you are also marketing your work when you present during an in-service in your unit, provide a poster or podium presentation at a conference, or publish a manuscript in a scholarly journal. Yet, are you reaching the audience you intended to reach? Will those in the audience have the ability and or resources to make the changes your work suggests need to be made in the clinical setting? Getting to a bigger audience can be important if you want to change practices or affect policy. Let us provide a recent example, family integrated care (FiCare) was recently introduced in Canada as a way to increase family engagement in the NICU.3 This group of authors published their findings in several different journals (both nursing and medicine) including 3 articles published in 2013 in Advances in Neonatal Care (ANC).4–6 These authors not only published their work in scholarly journals but also got their work into the mainstream media. It was shared in social networks, as well as on blogs, and at several different conferences and venues. Most neonatal care providers have at least heard of the intervention strategy even if they don't exactly understand what it is or how it could be implemented in their unit. These researchers have also developed their own Web site where you can freely view videos about their project.7 Yet, it is important to know that although their pilot study had many different types of variables, collected from several different vantage points including the infant, families, and healthcare professionals, the initial clinical trial was relatively small, conducted with 40 families and infants in a single Canadian NICU. Parents of infants who fit the inclusion criteria were approached when a bed space was available and were compared with a cohort of matched controls. No randomization occurred. Infants gained weight faster and went home sooner than their matched controls. Using many different avenues, these pilot study results have been shared and that one small study has made a big impact. There are now several more trials being conducted in Canada, the United States, as well as abroad. So the lesson to you is that getting your work out in several different venues can make a difference. We believe marketing did make a difference, although we are unsure how intentional this was for these authors. They got the word out in several different venues, and it has appeared to have made a difference with the uptake of this work. Their work is a good example of how to use scholarly publications, presentations, and social media to further spread innovations. Increasing the visibility of your work with social media. First, you will need an account in a social media network. If you are going to use the account for both professional and personal postings, be sure to ponder your audience. You might want to consider having 2 separate accounts, one for your personal use and one for your professional use. You might also want to consider how you will title your account and whom you will invite to be your friends (whom you are connected to) within each account. Each account might have different followers, and possibly the followers could be overlapping depending on the types of contact you have with them. Once you have an account, you can begin by making thoughtful posts 2 to 3 times each week. (See Figure 1 for some social media definitions and tips for using social media.) For example, if your research or clinical expertise is related to family-centered care, you can post breaking findings around the topic as they occur. Of your 3 weekly posts, one should be related to your own work and the other 2 should bring in the latest research or clinical practices from other teams. In this way, you can begin a conversation around your topic. Additions from other teams can be found by checking Google Alerts or the table of contents of your favorite journals. If you use the journal Web site, the site often has a sharing link with each article that connects to social media sites so that you can easily post the information. If you use this means for posting, be sure to link the post to your Web page. Once you decide what information you want to post, be sure to add a sentence or two that tells readers why they would want to look into getting more information about this topic. You will want to be intentional about your posting, so take the time to reflect about the story you are trying to tell or the message you want readers to get from checking out your page.FIGURE 1Advances in Neonatal Care has recently created a page on Facebook, and we will soon be creating pages on other social networks. The plan is to also have a Twitter page by the end of 2016. We will automatically be posting ANC articles. So please find and “like” our page so that you will see them on your Facebook feed. Please take the time to comment on the articles you like or find helpful to you work. We especially want authors to “share” their own content on their pages so that we can increase the number of participants in this conversation. This is your opportunity to raise awareness about neonatal content that is important to you. We hope you try it out and share your experiences with us. Tracking the success of your scholarly work in social media. Tracking the uptake of your work is not just about checking your social media site to see how many “likes” and comments you have received about your post. Tracking is also about how your post is shared, and hopefully shared again, and again. Wolters Kluwer, the publisher for ANC and many other scholarly journals, has adapted Altmetrics as a social network tracking strategy for following how individual articles published in its journals are being viewed on social networking sites. See Figure 2 for where to find the Altmetrics widget on your published article page on the ANC Web site (http://journals.lww.com/advancesinneonatalcare/pages/default.aspx). Although the example is not from ANC, the location is the same on our Web site. Figure 3 provides information about how best to use the Altmetrics widget to understand how your work is being shared on different social networks. You will be able to see a summary of the impact of your work in a social media world, with a list of where it has been shared and how many times it has been shared or commented on by others. You can even click on the widget to get more details about exactly where and by whom your article has been shared and whether there are comments about your work. We encourage you to post your own work and get comments to increase the visibility and impact of your work in a social media world. Sharing your ANC published article can now easily be done right from your ANC article page; on the right side of the page is a share section where if you are logged into Facebook (for example), you can choose to “like” the article and it will be shared on your own Facebook page.FIGURE 2FIGURE 3Currently, many authors check to see how often their work has been cited within other scholarly articles to understand the impact of their work.

    "abstract": "WATER BIRTH? DON'T DO IT Immersion in water during labor, delivery, or both has been gaining popularity in many parts of the world, although no one knows exactly how prevalent “water birth” is in the United States. We do know that many hospitals and birth centers are equipped with tubs or are adding them to accommodate birth plan requests for immersion during labor. The purported benefits of immersion during the first stage of labor are reduced pain, shorter labor, and less use of anesthesia, but no evidence indicates that it improves perinatal outcomes.1 The safety of immersion during the second stage of labor has not been established, has not been shown to benefit mother or fetus, and has resulted in case reports of serious adverse events in the newborn, including aspiration, drowning, infection, hyponatremia, perinatal depression, umbilical cord rupture (with neonatal hemorrhaging), and fatalities.2 Consequently, statements jointly released by the American Academy of Pediatrics1 and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists3 conclude that immersion during the first stage of labor, if practiced, should not prevent or inhibit other elements of care, including appropriate fetal and maternal monitoring. In contrast, immersion during delivery of the neonate should be considered an experimental procedure and performed only within the context of an appropriately designed clinical trial. The bottom line? Don't do it. 1. American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Fetus and Newborn and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee on Obstetric Practice.

DISCHARGE GUIDANCE FOR PRETERM INFANTS After weeks or months in the highly supportive environment of the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), when the time finally comes to go home, some families express hesitation about their ability to care for their preterm infants. It is not uncommon for parents to request a home apnea monitor, even when it is not indicated (or to jokingly ask the nurse to come home with them). A comprehensive, well-planned discharge of the preterm infant helps ensure a safe and effective transition to home, with parents who are confident in their ability to care for their preterm infant. A new statement from the Canadian Paediatric Society1 provides guidance to healthcare professionals in planning discharge from the NICU to home of medically stable preterm infants born before 34 weeks' gestational age. The statement covers the criteria for discharge readiness, including demonstration of functional maturation in the areas of physiological competencies of thermoregulation, control of breathing, respiratory stability, and feeding skills and weight gain. Supporting family involvement and providing education from the time of admission improve parental confidence and lessen their anxiety. Assessing the physical and psychosocial discharge environment, although not always easy to accomplish, is an important part of the discharge process. The statement emphasizes the multidisciplinary team's responsibilities for discharge planning and concludes with specific evidence- and consensus-based discharge recommendations. These include criteria for assessing infant and family readiness for discharge, performing necessary predischarge evaluations, screening tests, and vaccinations, educating the parents to care for their infant, and ensuring that an appropriate follow-up plan is in place at the time of discharge. 1.

THE POTENTIAL DANGERS OF SWADDLING Speaking of discharge, many parents continue to swaddle their infants for sleep after they leave the NICU. This makes sense, because their infants have been accustomed to weeks or months of being swaddled for sleep. Although primarily used for thermoregulation in the NICU, swaddling inhibits movement and calms fussy babies, making it easier to settle them to sleep in the supine position. Swaddling also obviates the need for blankets, which are unsafe in the sleeping environment of infants. In spite of these benefits, swaddling has not been recommended as a strategy for the prevention of sudden infant death syndrome1 and the potential risks associated with swaddling, have long been recognized.2 A recent study3 examined 36 swaddling incidents (ages 3 days to 15 months) reported to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, from 2004 to 2011. These included 5 cases involving wearable blankets (1 death, 2 injuries, and 2 potential injuries); 18 cases involving swaddle wraps (8 deaths and 10 potential injuries); 1 death involving an unspecified product (either swaddle wrap or wearable blanket); and 12 deaths involving swaddling in ordinary blankets. In the cases of infant deaths involving wearable blankets or swaddle wraps, 7 of 10 infants were placed to sleep supine, but the swaddled infants rolled to the prone position (1 reportedly at 5 weeks of age) and death was attributed to positional asphyxia. Among infants who were swaddled in standard blankets, 6 died in a similar fashion. In some cases involving both swaddling blankets and standard blankets, parts of the blanket were found covering the dead infant's nose and mouth. Other risk factors were believed to contribute to infant deaths, including the use of soft bedding and hyperthermia from overbundling in an excessively warm environment. Consumer Product Safety Commission is a voluntary database, and without a firm denominator, we have no way of knowing the true rate of injury or death associated with the use of swaddling practices or products. Still, it is clear from this report that swaddling in ordinary blankets is not a safe practice beyond the immediate newborn period. Neonatal caregivers must teach parents how to use swaddling safely, the alternatives to swaddling, and the potential harms associated with inappropriate swaddling practices. It is also important to discuss when to discontinue swaddling. Although some physicians disagree about how long swaddling can safely continue, Dr Rachel Moon, who is also lead author of the American Academy of Pediatrics Safe Sleep guidelines4 and chair of the Task Force on sudden infant death syndrome, believes that babies should not be swaddled past 2 months of age.5 The safety of commercially available swaddling wraps and wearable blankets has not been established, and people who use them do so at their own risk. 1.

WHEN MOTHERS SING, PREMIES FEED BETTER Who knew that operant conditioning would work with premies? This story is cool. It is so cool that it was picked up by many news agencies and disseminated widely on the Web, so you may already have heard about it. Based on the idea that a mother's voice is a powerful auditory cue to her preterm baby, researchers at Vanderbilt University showed that a lullaby sung by a baby's mother could be used to teach the baby to suck harder and longer on a pacifier, thereby improving oral feeding skills.1 Pacifier-activated music players (PAM) were prerecorded with their mother's own voice singing either “Hush Little Baby” or “Snuggle Puppy.” These lullabies were chosen by investigator and music therapist Olena Chorna, because their melodies were simple, repetitive, and within a single octave range.2 The study was conducted in 94 infants who had reached 34 to 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, were stable, and had no residual respiratory issues. The infants had to be receiving more than 50% of their feedings by gavage in the 3 days before the beginning of the study. Infants were randomly assigned to receive 5 daily 15-minute sessions of nonnutritive sucking, either with PAM with mother's recorded voice or with no PAM. When PAM group infants sucked correctly on their pacifiers (reaching a preset threshold pressure), they were rewarded by hearing their mother singing. If they stopped sucking, the music would stop. The interventions took place 30 to 45 minutes before the infant's regular feeding time, and the clinical team was masked to group assignment. The findings from this single study were very good. The PAM group had significantly increased oral feeding rates (2.0 vs 0.9 mL/min; P < .001), oral volume intake (91.1 vs 48.1 mL/kg per day; P = .001), oral feeds per day (6.5 vs 4.0; P < .001), and faster time-to-full oral feedings (31 vs 38 days; P = .04) compared with controls. Weight gain and cortisol levels during the 5-day protocol were not different between groups, with the latter suggesting that the intervention did not increase physiologic stress in the infants. Average hospital stays were 20% shorter in the PAM group, but the difference was not significant (P = .07). The authors conclude that “PAM with mother's voice is a developmentally appropriate successful oral feeding strategy that provides positive auditory stimulation to infants while supporting active parental roles during infant hospitalization.” More studies are needed to better understand how this strategy works. Studies with larger samples and in multiple settings need to be conducted to understand how this added stimulation would benefit infants or not in different environments. Further research would support the development of recommendations about when and how to best use the intervention. It is important to note that the length of stay was not significantly different for infants who received the intervention, and thus understanding how the days to full feeding change did not affect discharge needs further exploration.

    "abstract": "Dear NANN Colleagues, A focus on quality improvement (QI) work in the healthcare environment is standard of care for high-performing settings that seek to ensure excellence in care. Providing care in the context of QI is about providing care with a goal of the best outcome at every step of the process. In an attempt to simplify the burden of QI, the process is being integrated into many routine caregiving tasks. Historically, QI occurred in the background of caregiving and was not discussed unless there was a \"bad\" event or there was a significant improvement or decline in an outcome of specific interest. Today, QI occurs on the front line of caregiving and is routinely discussed by all members of the healthcare team. Moreover, QI participation is recognized as an integral aspect of excellent nursing care that is particularly important in high-risk settings like the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Why is QI so important that we all must participate? Quality improvement provides a basis for routine evaluation of daily healthcare activities that can positively or negatively affect infant outcomes. Reducing medical errors, increasing patient safety, and decreasing medical costs are all reasons to focus on QI work.1 Reimbursement is tied to the quality of the care provided; therefore, all healthcare systems must evaluate the QI work both \"inside\" and \"outside\" their environment. The questions that guide QI work are as follows: What are we doing? And, what can we do better, safer, and more efficaciously? To design QI work that provides important data on caregiving outcomes, the key features of an environment that contribute to outcomes must be considered, including the work culture of the environment. Collecting data with sufficient rigor to generate ample evidence that is not only creditable but also reproducible in another clinical setting is a challenge for many healthcare professionals, including nurses. This means the work must be well planned and managed so that the findings can be shared within and external to the organization. Sharing outside of the organization is important not only for benchmarking against national standards but also for assisting others to improve their care. Today caregiving is fast paced and highly integrated across many disciplines and caregivers; therefore, to be sustainable, QI work must be easily integrated into the routine caregiving activities of the healthcare team, thereby leveraging resources.1 Why do we want to do it the best way we can? This question almost seems redundant, but it is important that we are continuously striving to provide the best healthcare possible. There will always be constraints, but using resources effectively to provide care that is of the highest quality should always be the goal. With the increased complexity in the healthcare setting, provision of excellent QI work has also become more complex and that complexity is demonstrated by the evolution of methods seen in implementation science. Yes, QI improvement work is now considered its own science. There is even a focus on QI at the national level with the establishment of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Furthermore, publishing QI work in scholarly journals is important. Yet, what may be even more important is getting the information into routine care. This editorial outlines how best to move your scholarly QI work into publication. If we don't systematically document QI work, did it happen? If we don't share and demonstrate to others that you are meeting regional and national benchmarks, do consumers and other healthcare professionals trust that we are? These are important questions that force us to consider how best to share this work. Sometimes we read about QI projects in a journal and come away with more questions than answers. Have you ever read a QI project that you would like to replicate in your setting but the details of the process were not included in the report?2 To avoid this problem, the Standard for QUality Improvement Reporting Excellence (SQUIRE) guidelines were developed and recently refined.3 Increasing the visibility of your QI work. The best way to make your QI work more publishable is to first develop the QI work in your unit with a \"real\" plan. Focus on a few outcomes that have the potential to make a major difference in caregiving.1 For example, delivery room management could be a QI focus for neonatal intensive care teams because there is the potential for significant outcome changes. Once the focus of the QI project is chosen, clear measurable goals must be put into place with a timeline for meeting these objectives. To continue with our example, increasing quality in delivery room management, a multidisciplinary team will need to be assembled. Data will need to be collected; it is important that the data be rigorous without disrupting the care. So attention to the design of the project is important and should not be rushed. Consulting experts at this stage of the process can be important to collecting the right and most complete data. As researchers, the regret we often feel when we are into a project and realize we should have collected some data points that will be difficult to recover is not a good feeling but it happens, so taking time to consider the project outcomes and influencing factors before commencing data collection is important to getting the best results. Using the SQUIRE guidelines to guide the development of your QI work is not just for making the work publishable; using SQUIIRE will help increase the overall quality of the QI work so that your original question about care is truly answered. The SQUIRE guidelines include a checklist for publication; however, it has been suggested that this checklist should be used to guide the development and implementation of the work as well. The SQUIRE checklist guides us to answer what might seem to be 4 simple questions.3 Why did you start? What did you do? What did you find? What does it mean? Furthermore, the checklist provides several key points for answering each of these questions. Using these key points in the development and publication of your project can actually improve the rigor of your QI work and help make it not only replicable but also more likely sustainable. Please consider using the SQUIRE guidelines to guide and publish your QI work. Advances in Neonatal Care requires use of the SQUIRE guidelines for publication in our journal, and if you submit your QI projects (which we hope you do) for publication, expect to see us refer you to the SQUIRE guidelines or to ask you to consider using SQUIRE to reformat your manuscript if you have not done so already. We believe that using the SQUIRE guidelines is a great framework for making QI work more meaningful to the care provided to high-risk infants and families in the NICU. We believe using the SQUIRE guidelines also makes the steps of publication of QI more obtainable by those doing the work—caregivers at the bedside. Publishing your QI work is about telling the story of how your unit made or sustained a change in practice. Getting the message out about your QI work makes what you do every day have a bigger impact than just the single infant and family who just successfully left the NICU. These daily successes are important, but what is more important is that the strategies and practices you use to make a difference become routine (the way we do it) so that every infant and family successfully leaves the NICU. This means we need to learn from each other and continue to study and build the science of neonatal intensive care. Thank you for your support, Jacqueline M.

    "abstract": "UNSHIELDED PARENTERAL NUTRITION AND MORTALITY The fact that when exposed to light, parenteral nutrition preparations generate oxidants that are deleterious for cell survival is well known. However, the biologic effects of these oxidants in premature infants, even with their immature antioxidant defenses, are unknown. The practice of shielding parenteral nutrition solutions from light during administration to premature infants has therefore been inconsistent, and the benefits of such practices have been questioned. A new meta-analysis suggests that complete shielding of parenteral nutrition solutions from light should be undertaken.1 The analysis included 4 randomized clinical trials with a total of 800 premature infants that compared light-exposed with light-protected parenteral nutrition administration and determined the effect of shielding on mortality. Mortality in the light-protected group was half of that in the light-exposed group (95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.87) and twice as high in boys compared with girls (P = .01). From this analysis, the investigators concluded that shielding parenteral nutrition from light has vital repercussions that call for action to provide photoprotected delivery systems and infusion sets for use in premature infants. Neonatal intensive care units should review and update their policies to ensure that current practice completely and consistently protects parenteral nutrition from light during transport, storage, and administration. 1.

CONGENITAL HYPERINSULINISM AND NEONATAL HYPOGLYCEMIA Congenital hyperinsulinism, caused by inactivating mutations of the β-cell ATP-sensitive potassium channel, is the leading cause of persistent hypoglycemia in infants and children.1 The 2 distinct forms of congenital hyperinsulinism are diffuse disease, in which cells throughout the pancreas are hyperactive, and focal disease, which features a discrete lesion of islet cell hyperplasia or adenomatosis.1 Both forms often require surgery. Near-total pancreatectomy is palliative in diffuse disease and the lesions of focal disease can be resected, potentially curing the disease. Children with congenital hyperinsulinism who require surgery have, in past research, been found to be at risk for the development of diabetes and permanent neurologic injury. However, it was unknown whether recent advances in molecular diagnosis, imaging, and management had improved either or both of these outcomes for the population of children with congenital hyperinsulinism. A team of investigators at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia undertook a cross-sectional study of 121 children (median age = 8.9 years) who received care at their institution from 1960 to 2008 to determine the prevalence of diabetes and neurobehavioral deficits in individuals with surgically treated hyperinsulinism.1 They found that 36% of the children developed diabetes and 48% developed neurobehavioral abnormalities. The high rate of neurologic injury is believed to be the result of recurrent, persistent hypoglycemia in the neonatal period. These findings have implications for those who care for newborn infants. Distinguishing between transitional neonatal glucose regulation in normal newborns and hypoglycemia that persists or occurs for the first time beyond the first 3 days of life is important for prompt diagnosis and effective treatment to avoid serious consequences, including seizures and permanent brain injury.2 Neonates at risk (very large for gestational age, a high glucose requirement to maintain normoglycemia) must be identified and supported with feedings and intravenous dextrose during the first 48 hours of life. After 48 hours, infants with persistent hypoglycemia must be carefully evaluated to determine the underlying cause of the hypoglycemia and treat it appropriately. 1.

EFFECT OF RUDENESS ON TEAMWORK Intimidation, one type of workplace incivility, is believed to be a stumbling block to patient safety because it hampers effective communication.1 Like intimidation, rudeness can influence interactions among team members. In healthcare settings, rudeness can come from peers, supervisors, or even patients and families. Rude behavior may escalate during times of stress, when events are not unfolding the way one would prefer. But do these behaviors improve a stressful situation? Little is known about the effects of such behaviors as rudeness and incivility on team performance. Could rude behavior negatively affect performance, and therefore outcomes, by preventing team members from being helpful and cooperative during situations in which the contributions of each member are critical? An interesting study2 tested the impact of rudeness on the performance of teams of neonatal intensive care unit caregivers (nurses and physicians) at 4 Israeli hospitals. Caregivers were placed in 24 teams comprising 1 physician and 2 nurses. Each team participated in a simulation exercise involving a preterm neonate whose condition acutely deteriorated owing to necrotizing enterocolitis. The teams were told that a foreign expert would be observing them and then they were randomly assigned either to a control situation or an exposure group. In the exposure group, the foreign expert made mildly rude comments during the exercise, although not related to the team's performance. The videotaped simulation sessions were evaluated by 3 independent judges (blinded to team exposure), who assessed team performance, information sharing, and help seeking. The teams exposed to rudeness had lower mean diagnostic scores and procedural performance scores than control teams, indicating that rude behavior has adverse consequences on the performance of teams in a critical, potentially stressful situation. Information sharing and help-seeking behaviors mediated the effects of rudeness on team performance. Although this study did not assess the effects of peer-to-peer rudeness on team performance, it suggests that interpersonal interactions during a stressful situation can affect outcomes. 1.

Pediatrics. 2015;136:487–495 TWENTY YEARS OF NEONATAL OUTCOME IMPROVEMENT A major National Institutes of Health study reveals that extremely preterm infants born at US academic centers during the last 20 years are surviving in greater numbers with fewer complications.1 Survival increased most markedly for infants born at 23 to 24 weeks' gestation. Of those born at 24 weeks, for example, only 52% survived in 1993 whereas 65% survived in 2012. Survival without major morbidity increased for infants born at 25 to 28 weeks' gestation. For infants born at 27 weeks, for example, survival without major morbidity increased from 29% in 1993 to 47% in 2012. No change was seen for infants born at 22 to 24 weeks' gestation. To document these improvements, the authors reviewed 20-year trends in maternal/neonatal care, complications, and deaths among extremely preterm infants born at 26 Neonatal Research Network Centers between 1993 and 2012. They analyzed data from a prospective registry of 34,636 infants born at 22 to 28 weeks' gestation, weighing 401 to 1500 g at birth. Some interesting trends in prenatal and neonatal care were found. Use of antenatal corticosteroids increased from 24% in 1993 to 87% in 2012. Delivery room intubation decreased from 80% in 1993 to 65% in 2012. After increasing in the 1990s, postnatal steroid use declined to 8% in 2004, with no significant change thereafter. Although most infants were ventilated, the use of continuous positive airway pressure without ventilation increased from 7% in 2002 to 11% in 2012. Trends in rates of morbidities varied. Despite no improvement from 1993 to 2004, rates of late-onset sepsis declined between 2005 and 2012 for infants of each gestational age. Rates of other morbidities also declined, but bronchopulmonary dysplasia increased between 2009 and 2012 for infants born at 26 to 27 weeks' gestation. The investigators concluded that among extremely preterm infants born at US academic centers over the last 20 years, changes in maternal and infant care practices have led to improved survival and modest reductions in several morbidities. These findings may be valuable in counseling families and developing novel interventions. 1. Stoll BJ, Hansen NI, Bell EF, et al.

There is a wide spectrum of brain and eye defects associated with this diagnosis; therefore, this diagnosis may not initially be considered. This diagnosis is especially difficult for families because there is no treatment available and management of the condition is supportive only. Parents of an infant with WWS need to be shown support and empathy while they are dealing with the sorrow of a terminal illness. Use of a nursing model, “Middle range theory of chronic sorrow,” will be instrumental in assisting staff as they care for the patient and the patient's family. They also need to be guided toward receiving genetic counseling to weigh their options for future family planning as the risk of another WWS pregnancy is 25%.",

The mothers and infants in Group 1 received only 1 dose of intrapartum antibiotics; Group 2 received > or =2 doses of intrapartum antibiotics. The sample consisted of a total of 128 women and their infants.This pilot study used a descriptive correlational design. Data were obtained over a 6-month period by a retrospective chart review. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the demographic data and chi(2) statistical analysis was done to compare the frequency of early-onset GBS disease in each group to determine if there were differences between groups.The Pearson chi(2) value for comparing the 2 groups was 0 with 1 degree of freedom indicating no difference of probability outcome between the 2 groups.There were no differences found in the incidence of early-onset GBS disease in newborns when a GBS positive pregnant woman received 1 or 2 doses of intrapartum antibiotics. These data provide further supporting evidence for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendations that were based on the premise that vertical transmission of GBS will be greatly reduced by administration of 1 dose of intrapartum antibiotics at least 4 hours before delivery to expectant mothers.",

In addition to the epidemiologic implications, on a practical level, the ability to predict preterm delivery may help the neonatal team triage to assure bed availability, and to predict and provide appropriate staffing for new admissions. On an individual patient level, understanding the maternal history, including antenatal risk factors and relevant monitoring and testing, is an important foundation for subsequent neonatal care. A number of new diagnostic testing tools are being used in obstetric practice to enhance the ability to predict preterm delivery. The results of fetal fibronectin and ultrasound measurement of cervical length are increasingly used to triage obstetrical patients. Results of these tests may prompt transfer to a tertiary facility. Part 1 of this 2-part series will describe antenatal testing techniques used to predict preterm delivery (PTD), as well as highlight the emerging developments in maternal serum testing.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: The primary diagnosis is postnatal HCMV infection. INTERVENTIONS: The infant was too preterm to be treated with antiviral medication. Instead, he was treated with a diet with no fresh MOM but only freeze-thawed MOM to reduce the viral load. OUTCOMES: Conjugated bilirubin values normalized after the infant was fed freeze-thawed MOM with a reduced viral load and formula. PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS: The awareness of HCMV-positive mothers giving birth to extremely preterm infants should be increased. Feeding only freeze-thawed MOM or in combination with fresh MOM should be considered prophylactically to avoid transmission of high viral loads of HCMV to these vulnerable infants.",

    "abstract": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Breastfeeding is the optimal feeding method and human milk the optimal source of nutrition for neonates and infants. Research addressing the impact of marijuana use during breastfeeding is limited. As the professional voice of neonatal nurses, the National Association of Neonatal Nurses (NANN) recommends women abstain from marijuana consumption while breastfeeding or providing human milk for consumption.1 The most common illicit drug used during pregnancy and lactation in the United States and Canada is marijuana. Actual use is most likely higher than reported ranges of 3.4% to 16%, as it is based on self-reporting.2–6 Marijuana is often perceived by consumers as being safe, likely contributing to continued use throughout pregnancy and lactation.7 Confusion regarding the safety of marijuana use while pregnant or breastfeeding has followed its legalization in parts of the United States and Canada.8,9 However, there is sufficient evidence that marijuana use during pregnancy can lead to decreased infant birth weights and increased risks of preterm delivery, along with neurodevelopmental impacts in school-aged children and adolescents.2,10–18 Marijuana crosses into human milk after maternal consumption.1,19–21 Because of insufficient data on both immediate neonatal risks and potential long-term impacts regarding maternal marijuana consumption, women who are providing human milk for consumption should be advised to avoid marijuana consumption.1 When maternal milk is not available, donor human milk should be obtained from a reputable milk bank and milk sharing is highly discouraged.1,22–24 Educating and counseling lactating mothers in a supportive and nonjudgmental manner regarding the goal of abstaining from marijuana consumption based on the potential risks of marijuana use during lactation are key roles of the nurse. For lactating mothers who choose to continue using marijuana, the nurse should continue to provide lactation support and advise them to minimize their consumption. Nurses should participate in developing evidence-based, nonjudgmental, and nonpunitive hospital, state, and national guidelines and legislation addressing marijuana use during lactation. Nurses should play key roles in driving further research addressing maternal use of marijuana during pregnancy and lactation.",

    "abstract": "While 2020 is now behind us, we are still reeling from the uncertainty and stress that has accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic. Current recommendations for neonatal care in the context of COVID-19 call for testing, handwashing/hand sanitization, wearing of personal protective equipment, social distancing, quarantining to reduce exposure, and isolation if experiencing symptoms.1 Moreover, great advances have been made in the prevention and spread of the virus; however, emerging literature highlights the deleterious effects of well-intentioned hospital-based policies for the care of infants and families in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).1 The lack of evidence about the novel virus has caused a steep learning curve among professionals and the public. Practices aimed at protecting healthcare staff and patients from exposure and spread have also heightened confusion and fear, decreased facial recognition, muffled communication, and limited parent/family presence at the bedside.2 These practices are linked to depression, anxiety, and isolation for parents in the NICU.2 Healthcare providers share concerns regarding the potential risks of long-term mental health outcomes for infants and their parents.1 These stressors may influence our ability as providers to support infant–parent regulation and relationships. Over the last 50 years, the focus of neonatal care has been on the biophysiological management of premature and sick infants, with care occurring within a rapidly changing technical environment. However, understanding the holistic needs of the infant as a biophysical–psychosocial–emotional interactive complex system within a nurturing parent/family relationship is central to the infant's optimal health over the life span.2,3 A greater emphasis on infant- and family-centered developmental care (IFCDC) principles and infant mental health (IMH) is foundational to guide interprofessionals in supporting the healing, growth, and development of the infant in an intensive care environment.3 The IMH emerging science emphasizes the importance of safely engaging the family in the care, culture, and environment of the infant to promote internal regulation, coregulation between the parents, social–emotional development, and positive mental health.1,3 IMH principles include understanding growth and development in the context of the infant's environment, consideration for the individual developmental needs and perspectives of the infant, and reflection on ways the NICU affects the infant's development and relationships.3 Integrating IMH principles in the healthcare culture, policies, and procedures of practice can make a difference in the short- and long-term outcomes of the infant, parent(s), and family.3 It is important now more than ever to support IMH in the NICU during the COVID-19 pandemic. An interprofessional Consensus Committee consisting of nursing, neonatology, physical and occupational therapy, psychology, social work, speech–language, and parent support professionals developed 6 domains of IFCDC, which are described through standards, and competencies of best practice.4 These domains include the following: Systems thinking in complex adaptive systems; Positioning and touch for the newborn; Sleep and arousal interventions for the newborn; Skin-to-skin contact with intimate family members; Reducing and managing pain and stress in newborns and families; and Management of feeding, eating, and nutrition delivery. In an effort to support infants and families through the pandemic crisis, the IFCDC domains highlight areas in which nurses can advocate and support policy changes that promote IMH in the NICU. Policies that center the family in the care of the infant are “essential.”5 Parent education regarding infant care and infection prevention/control should occur at the bedside.2 Virtual, video, and audio electronic measures can be used to promote communication and enhancement of parent engagement when parents are unable to visit.1 Parents should also be involved in the scheduling of rounds for shared decision-making with the healthcare team, collaborating in developing the plan of care.2 Healthcare providers can also teach parents the techniques of touch, handling, positioning, holding, and transfer to/from the bed with medical devices to support their infant's development. Assessing and evaluating the well-being of parents in the NICU are best performed in a timely and appropriate manner—during the time of stress, not delayed or optional.1 Identifying the proximal and distal stressors affecting each infant, parent, and family can help individualize support and self-care strategies to cope.3 Nurses are well positioned to offer both behavioral and environmental recommendations to support the well-being of infants and families. Provision of IFCDC care and IMH is essential to the health of infants, parent(s), and families, especially during critical times such as a pandemic. Integrating the 6 domains of IFCDC into nursing care may help ensure that IMH needs are met in the time of COVID-19 and thereafter. In our efforts, we should aim to create more flexibility and support using evidence-based approaches that promote IMH principles. Strategies to secure the presence of the parent with the infant are critical, and nurses are in the unique position to advocate for policies and procedures that enable this type of support. While many changes may be made in response to COVID-19, we hope that you will consider maintaining these recommendations beyond the pandemic. See https://nicudesign.nd.edu/nicu-care-standards.

    "abstract": "Background: Reported benefits of virtual programs include user satisfaction and feasibility to train nurses to utilize pain scales. However, the effectiveness of the virtual neonatal pain management program on nurses' knowledge and scoring skill acquisition has not been examined. Purpose: This study developed a comprehensive virtual program on neonatal pain management and examined its effectiveness on nurses' knowledge and skill acquisition of selected pain scales. Methods: Evidence-based content was designed as a virtual program and pre-and posttests to examine skill and knowledge acquisition were developed and validated. Analysis of covariance was used to assess the differences from pre- to posttest based on the intensity of participants' involvement while examining the overall effectiveness of the program. Results: A total of 115 nurses representing 7 hospitals completed the virtual neonatal pain management program, and 52 nurses completed the posttest. The Student paired t test showed an increase in posttest scores from pretest scores among participants. Participants' final degrees and years of experience were not related to posttest scores. The analysis of covariance showed that the high study group had a significantly higher amount of change in total scores and pain measurement skill scores than the low study group on the posttest. Implications for Practice: The virtually delivered neonatal pain management program can be useful for nurses' attainment of knowledge and skills for managing neonatal pain, including an appropriate use of selected scoring tools. Implications for Research: It is necessary to examine how organizational unit attendance rate for e-learning and posttest results are related to patient outcomes.

    "abstract": "Background: The rate of infants born with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) increased by more than 500% between 2004 and 2016. Although feeding problems among infants diagnosed with NAS have been documented, the risk of feeding problems among infants diagnosed with NAS has not been estimated. Purpose: This study evaluates the extent to which feeding problems among infants diagnosed with NAS differ from thise in infants without an NAS diagnosis. Methods/Search Strategy: A matched retrospective cohort study (2008-2017) of infants diagnosed with NAS in the United States was conducted using hospital admission data from the Cerner Health Facts Database. Multivariable logistic regressions controlling for confounders were used to assess whether an NAS diagnosis is associated with hospital admission due to feeding problems. Findings/Results: Infants with NAS were nearly 3 times as likely (OR = 2.81; 95% CI, 2.68-2.95) to have feeding problems compared with infants without NAS after adjusting for infant and hospital characteristics. Lower birth weight, higher infant age, Hispanic ethnicity, and hospital location in the Midwest region were also associated with higher odds of feeding problems. Infants diagnosed with NAS who had feeding problems had slightly lower odds of being offered lactation services than infants without NAS who had feeding problems. Implications for Practice: These findings suggest the need for targeted feeding interventions. Implications for Research: Future research on infants with NAS may build on these findings by assessing the role of maternal factors such as nutrition and substance use to understand how parental characteristics also influence the risk for hospitalization.",

    "abstract": "Hospitalization of a newborn infant is stressful for all mothers. Hospitals in Malawi have limited nursing staff and support, so mothers are the primary care providers for their hospitalized infants. Few studies have explored the experience of these mothers as both care providers and mothers.The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of mothers during the hospitalization of the infant. The goal was to increase knowledge of their primary concerns about the hospital stay.This was a descriptive qualitative study conducted at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Malawi. Mothers were interviewed prior to their infant's discharge. We used the directed content analysis approach to analyze our data.Twenty mothers of preterm or full-term infants were interviewed. The primary concerns were perinatal experiences, the infant's condition and care including breastfeeding, support from family members, and support and care from healthcare providers. Additionally, mothers of preterm infants were concerned about the burdens of kangaroo mother care.In hospitals that provide limited nursing support to mothers and their infants, it is important to identify a support system for the mother and provide mothers with information on infant care.Future research should identify specific supports and resources in the community and hospital settings that are associated with positive hospital experiences.",

The association of ASF and a diagnosis of DDH remains unknown.To determine the association of ASF in the gluteal and femoral regions with a diagnosis of DDH.The correlation of ASF and other physical examination findings with DDH was compared retrospectively. The medical records of infants who underwent DDH screening in the clinic were analyzed. The physical examination findings were reviewed and categorized as ASF, clunk of the hip, limb-length discrepancy, hip abduction limitation, combined conditions of musculoskeletal disorders, and regular screening for DDH. The hip conditions were classified by Graf's ultrasound method. Type IIb and higher classifications were defined as DDH. The diagnosed rate and severity of DDH based on physical examination findings were calculated and compared.Clinical data of 3266 infants aged up to 6 months were reviewed, and 194 infants were diagnosed with DDH by ultrasound examination. ASF was the most common indication for DDH screening (64.5%; 2107/3266). However, this was poorly correlated with a diagnosis of DDH (4.79%; P < .0001). No difference was found between the Graf classification severity and various indications ( P = .079).Clinicians should recognize that, although ASF is the most common reason for DDH screening in infants, ASF does not correlate with a diagnosis of DDH.Additional research should examine the relationship between DDH and ASF in other populations.",

The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Parkland Health and Hospital System in Dallas, Texas, has a team of 3 nurse educators. These educators determined the need for increased nurse confidence, skill, and response in code and emergent situations within the NICU. The education team also recognized the need to increase nurse involvement in professional development activities and preparation for the national certification examination.The purpose of this article is to describe how a NICU education team, in a level III NICU, trained nurses using simulated scenarios to improve nursing knowledge for national certification, skill, and confidence in code situations and to provide ongoing professional development opportunities within a controlled learning environment.The intervention designed to meet these specific goals for the NICU was the creation of a simulation team (called the \"Drill Team\") to facilitate simulated activities created by the NICU education team. This simulation strategy was found to have multiple advantages for content delivery, as multiple learning styles can be incorporated into the simulated activities.Nurses demonstrated improved performance, knowledge acquisition, and knowledge retention after the Drill Team project. Nursing confidence in code performance also increased using this intervention.This educational intervention can be replicated and utilized in nursing education for all specialties.Further research could be conducted to determine the effectiveness of simulated activities and national certification pass rates.",

    "abstract": "Background: Parental decisions regarding infant sleep practices vary widely, resulting in a lack of adherence to the American Academy of Pediatrics safe sleep recommendations (SSR) and consequently an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Preterm infants are among those at a highest risk for SIDS, yet few studies focus on parental decision-making surrounding sleep practices for preterm infants. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify factors influencing decisions concerning infant sleep practices of mothers of preterm infants. Methods: This study used a mixed-methods design. Recruitment was through social media messaging by 2 parent support organizations. An online survey was used to assess factors influencing mothers' decisions regarding sleep practices for preterm infants. Findings/Results: Survey participants (n = 98) were from across the United States. Mothers of preterm infants (mean gestational age at birth = 29.42 weeks) most often reported positioning infants on their back to sleep (92.3%) and a low (15.4%) use of a pacifier at sleep time. Three themes emerged for the decisions made: adherence to SSR; nonadherence to SSR; and infant-guided decisions. Regardless of the decision, mothers indicated that anxiety over the infant's well-being resulted in a need for sleep practices that facilitated close monitoring of the infant. Implications for Practice and Research: The findings of this study indicate the need for understanding the underlying anxiety preventing mothers from adhering to SSR despite knowing them, along with tailoring infant sleep messaging and education to improve safety of sleep practices for preterm infants. Research is needed to examine decision making in more diverse populations.",

Despite the influence of social and demographic factors on infant health outcomes, their relationship with intestinal inflammation is unknown.To explore the influence of maternal race, maternal socioeconomic status, and infant sex on intestinal inflammation in VLBW infants.This was a secondary analysis of existing data from a randomized controlled trial of 143 infants 32 weeks' gestation or less and weighing 1250 g or less. In the previous study, fecal calprotectin and S100A12 values were collected at weeks 3 and 6. The infant sample was determined on the basis of the availability of these results, which served as intestinal inflammation biomarkers for the present study. General linear mixed models assessed the relationship between biomarkers and social and demographic factors. Gestational age, antibiotic exposure, mother's own milk feeding, acuity, and week of sample collection were used as control variables.The sample included 124 infants. Fifty-two infants (42%) were African American, 86 (69%) had Medicaid coverage, and 65 (53%) were male. Fecal calprotectin levels were higher in African American infants (P = .02) and infants with private insurance coverage (P = .009); no difference was found between sexes. There was no association between S100A12 levels and infant sex, maternal race, or socioeconomic status.Consideration of social and demographic factors may be important when caring for VLBW infants. Further exploration of factors contributing to associations between social or demographic factors and intestinal inflammation is needed.",

    "abstract": "Background: Annually 2.5 million infants die in the first 28 days of life, with a significant regional distribution disparity. An estimated 80% of those could be saved if neonatal resuscitation were correctly and promptly initiated. A barrier to achieving the target is the knowledge and skills of healthcare workers. Purpose: The objective of this cluster randomized trial was to assess the improvement and retention of resuscitation skills of nurses, midwives, and birth attendants in 2 birth centers serving 60 villages in rural India using high-frequency, low-dose training. Results: There was a significant difference ( P &lt; .05) between the groups in the rate of resuscitation, with 18% needing resuscitation in the control group and 6% in the intervention group. The posttest scores for knowledge retention at the final 8-month evaluation were significantly better in the intervention group than in the control group (intervention group mean rank 19.4 vs control group mean rank 10.3; P &lt; .05). The success rate of resuscitation was not significantly different among the groups. Implications for Practice: Improved knowledge retention at 8 months and the lower need for resuscitation in the intervention group support the efficacy of the high-frequency, low-dose education model of teaching in this setting. Implications for Research: Replication of these findings in other settings with a larger population cohort is needed to study the impact of such intervention on birth outcomes in low-resource settings.",

    "abstract": "In premature and critically ill infants, a complete blood count (CBC) is commonly collected via the heel-stick method, which is preferred because of the ongoing requirements to preserve intravenous sites. However, because of sample clotting, these specimens are often rejected, leading to unnecessary repeat heel sticks, painful stimuli, and increased costs.The purpose of this quality improvement project was to decrease the rate of clotted CBC samples obtained from neonates admitted in the neonatal intensive care unit.The RE-AIM translation model, which stands for Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance, was adopted to decrease the rate of clotted CBC samples through staff education, randomized audits of the staff's heel-stick technique, and the development and implementation of a standardized capillary blood sampling protocol. The primary outcome measure was the rate of clotted CBC samples, which was defined as the proportion of clotted CBC samples.CBC clotted sample rates decreased by 27%, resulting in a cost saving of $1136, and overall CBC rejection rates decreased by 23%.All hospital units should provide staff with an evidence-based resource, recurrent education, and evaluation of skills to avoid unnecessary repeat heel sticks and prevent increased pain sensitivity, social hypervigilance, and avoidance behavior in early infancy.Future efforts should focus on the long-term benefits of routine education and its effects on clotted sample rates and whether samples drawn by laboratory phlebotomy staff versus registered nurses/patient care technicians result in disproportionate rejection rates.",

    "abstract": "Excessive supplemental oxygen exposure in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) can be associated with oxygen-related toxicities, which can lead to negative clinical consequences. Use of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) can be a successful strategy for avoiding hyperoxia in the NICU. iNO selectively produces pulmonary vasodilation and has been shown to improve oxygenation parameters across the spectrum of disease severity, from mild to very severe, in neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure associated with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.An online survey was conducted among members of the National Association of Neonatal Nurse Practitioners to gain insight into the level of understanding and knowledge among neonatal nurse practitioners (NNPs) about optimizing supplemental oxygen exposure and the use of iNO in the NICU setting.Of 937 NNP respondents, 51% reported that their healthcare team typically waits until the fraction of inspired oxygen level is 0.9 or more before adding iNO in patients not responding to oxygen ventilation alone. Among respondents with 1 or more iNO-treated patients per month, only 35% reported they know the oxygenation index level at which iNO should be initiated. Less than 20% of NNPs reported perceived benefits associated with early initiation of iNO for preventing progression to use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or reducing the length of hospital stay, and about one-third of respondents reported they believe early iNO use minimizes hyperoxia.More education is needed for NNPs regarding the negative effects of oxidative stress in neonates.Additional clinical trials investigating the most beneficial strategies for avoiding neonatal hyperoxia are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Background: Transient neonatal hypoglycemia occurs most commonly in newborns who are small for gestational age, large for gestational age, infants of diabetic mothers, and late preterm infants. An exact blood glucose value has not been determined for neonatal hypoglycemia, and it is important to note that poor neurologic outcomes can occur if hypoglycemia is left untreated. Interventions that separate mothers and newborns, as well as use of formula to treat hypoglycemia, have the potential to disrupt exclusive breastfeeding. Purpose: To determine whether implementation of a toolkit designed to support staff in the adaptation of the practice change for management of newborns at risk for hypoglycemia, that includes 40% glucose gel in an obstetric unit with a level 2 nursery will decrease admissions to the Intermediate Care Nursery, and increase exclusive breastfeeding. Method: This descriptive study used a retrospective chart review for pre/postimplementation of the Management of Newborns at Risk for Hypoglycemia Toolkit (Toolkit) using a convenience sample of at-risk newborns in the first 2 days of life to evaluate the proposed outcomes. Results: Following implementation of the Toolkit, at-risk newborns had a clinically but not statistically significant 6.5% increase in exclusive breastfeeding and a clinically but not statistically significant 5% decrease in admissions to the Intermediate Care Nursery. Implications for Practice: The Toolkit was designed for ease of staff use and to improve outcomes for the at-risk newborn. Implications for Research: Future research includes replication at other level 2 and level 1 obstetric centers and investigation into the number of 40% glucose gel doses that can safely be administered.",

    "abstract": "A joint position statement from the Canadian Association of Neonatal Nurses (CANN), the Canadian Association of Perinatal and Women's Health Nurses (CAPWHN), the Council of International Neonatal Nurses (COINN), and the National Association of Neonatal Nurses (NANN) was published in 2017 in the Canadian Journal of Nursing Research. This new position statement provides an evidence-based framework for the institutional implementation of developmentally supportive, neuroprotective care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).1,2 BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE The use of age-appropriate care as an organized framework for care delivery in the NICU is founded on the work of Als3 and her synactive theory of development. This theoretical construct has been advanced by the work of Gibbins and colleagues4 with the “universe of developmental care” conceptual model and developmentally supportive care core measures.5 The core measures for developmentally supportive care were endorsed by NANN in 2011 as its clinical practice guidelines for Age-Appropriate Care of the Premature and Critically Ill Hospitalized Infant6 and have been recently revised and expanded to reflect the most current evidence-based best practices in developmentally supportive, neuroprotective care.7 The core measures for developmentally supportive care outline disease-independent core competencies for professionals serving premature and critically ill hospitalized infants. Supported by The Joint Commission and the Primer Standards of Accreditation and Health Canada, the institutional implementation of these core measures requires a strong framework for institutional operationalization. This framework is presented in the newly published guidelines for the institutional implementation of developmental neuroprotective care in the NICU and summarized at http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0844562117706882 and http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0844562117708126.1,2 HIGHLIGHTS These 2-part guidelines include the first international joint position statement between 4 sister nursing associations, as well as best practice recommendations to adopt and integrate developmental neuroprotective care at the institutional level. Part A of the guidelines presents the background and rationale for the development of institutional implementation guidelines. This includes a thorough literature review of the history, levels of evidence, and support for developmental care in the NICU, as well as implementation strategies extracted from the implementation science literature.8 Part B of the guidelines presents detailed recommendations for each implementation phase supported and justified by the current evidence.2 The guidelines are operationalized over 5 phases: Plan, Educate, Prioritize, Evaluate, and Ensure Sustainability. Each phase includes different steps over time to ensure their implementation. These phases and steps might sometimes occur in parallel, whereas others might be delayed, depending on the need and priorities of each unit. Likewise, they can work in circularity, where one change might influence another. However, the best chance for successful adoption and integration of a developmentally supportive, neuroprotective care philosophy and subsequent implementation within an organization are patience, endurance, and persistence.9 Clearly defined standards, accountability metrics, and strong leadership are needed to facilitate and sustain a cultural transformation. CONCLUSION As the professional voice of neonatal nurses around the world, NANN, CANN, CAPWHN, & COINN recommend the use of these guidelines to provide a framework for the standardization of the implementation of developmentally supportive, neuroprotective care. These guidelines provide flexibility to support the individual needs of each unit and organization by providing an evidence-based systematic approach to implementation in NICUs.

    "abstract": "Background: Maternal prenatal screening is essential in preventing pregnancy complications as well as preventing and/or predicting neonatal and infant medical issues after delivery that are due to certain communicable diseases. Purpose: This article is aimed at gathering and presenting the most recent information regarding the most common prenatal screening laboratory studies and the implications with the various diseases. Methods/Search Strategy: An extensive medical database search was performed and the most relevant medical texts regarding the subject of prenatal screening were obtained. Findings/Results: Maternal screenings should be performed at the first provider visit once pregnancy has been confirmed. Additional screenings vary based on the specific disease and on maternal risk factors. Methods of screenings involve measuring antigen or antibody titers, a combination of antigen/antibody titers, or by specialized genetic tests. Implications for Practice: Providers responsible for pregnant women should be able to identify which diseases they need to screen for and how to interpret the findings. Neonatal providers should be able to interpret the findings and they should also be able to manage neonates appropriately. Implications for Research: Future research should be aimed at developing better, cost-effective tests for both existing diseases and new diseases that either impact large or small populations of pregnant women and their fetuses.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breastfeeding (BF), skin-to-skin care (SSC), and sucrose effectively reduce babies' pain during newborn blood work, but these strategies are infrequently used. Our team developed a parent-targeted video intervention showing the effectiveness of the 3 pain management strategies. PURPOSE: To evaluate neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) parents' (1) baseline knowledge and previous use of BF, SSC, and sucrose for procedural pain management; (2) intention to advocate/use BF, SSC, or sucrose for their infants' future blood work after viewing the video; (3) intention to recommend the video to other parents; and (4) perceptions of the video and identify areas for improvement. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of parents in an NICU. RESULTS: Fifty parents were enrolled: 33 mothers and 17 fathers. More than two-thirds (68%) of parents had prior knowledge of analgesic effects of sucrose; knowledge of SSC and BF as pain-reduction strategies was lower: 44% and 34%, respectively. Eighty-six percent of parents felt the video was the right length; 7 (14%) felt the video was too long. After viewing the video, 96% of parents intended to advocate for BF, SSC, or sucrose for pain management and 88% parents would recommend the video to other parents. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The video is acceptable to parents, is feasible to deliver to parents in an NICU, and has potential to increase parents' intent to advocate for pain management strategies for their infants. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Future studies are required to evaluate the effectiveness of this parent-targeted intervention on increasing actual use of pain management in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "THE UPWARD TREND OF MARIJUANA USE AMONG PREGNANT FEMALES Nurses who provide patient care for patients in labor and delivery, nurseries, and neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) are not surprised to hear the escalation of marijuana use in the pregnant females, as the widespread legalization of cannabis continues. Marijuana is \"the most commonly used illicit drug during pregnancy\" according to a recent publication of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).1 The drug is detectable approximately 30 days from last use.2 Self-report of pregnant females in California from 2009 to 2016 showed an increased use of marijuana during the month prior to delivery from 2.4% to 3.9%. This global increase of all pregnant females is especially alarming in light of 14.6% of pregnant adolescents reported use within the past month, which is likely an underestimate.2 According to data from the United States from the years 2002 to 2014; 22% of pregnant adolescents and 19% of pregnant 18- to 24-year-olds tested positive for marijuana on screening tests during labor.1 Evidence also suggests that the use of prenatal marijuana impairs fetal growth and neurodevelopment.3 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends we \"discourage pregnant and breast-feeding women from using marijuana\" according to a committee opinion.4 Updated and specific recommendations for providers to discuss with patients include: \"Obtain a history: ask women trying to conceive or in early pregnancy about their use of tobacco, alcohol, drugs (including marijuana), and other nonmedical use of medications. Counsel women who report marijuana use about potential adverse health consequences associated with continued marijuana use during pregnancy. Encourage pregnant women and those considering pregnancy to discontinue marijuana use. Encourage pregnant women and those considering pregnancy to discontinue using medicinal marijuana and use another therapy that has better pregnancy-specific data. Because the data are insufficient to evaluate the effects of marijuana use on infants during lactation and breast-feeding, discourage lactating and breast-feeding women from using marijuana\"4 In a recently published retrospective cohort study, data from the US National Inpatient Sample (1999-2013) were reviewed to determine obstetrical and neonatal outcome differences in mothers (n = 66,925) who were abusing or using cannabis during pregnancy compared with unexposed mothers. Using unconditional logistic regression, the findings were significant for higher risk of a preterm infant (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval, 1.36-1.43) and/or growth restricted (odds ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.30-1.41) in those women reporting cannabis use.5 In addition, there was a significant difference reported in cannabis use from 0.28% in 1999 to 0.95% using in 2013 (P < .05).5 These findings mirror the California study described earlier.2 We understand from this growing body of evidence that cannabis use is increasing especially among our youth. Adolescent and young mothers are at the greatest risk for preterm labor and/or delivery, have the poorest socioeconomic status with few resources to care for an at-risk infant.2 Many may not understand the ramifications of using marijuana during pregnancy including the risk to infant outcomes and possible requirements for reporting positive drug tests to authorities.4 Clearly, we have a problem that will likely increase, as cannabis legalization continues across the United States. CAR BEDS MAY SOON BE GONE FOREVER ... We have all encountered the preterm infant ready for discharge who cannot pass a car seat oximetry test. Repeat testing is conducted with continued desaturations and/or bradycardia ... parents are frustrated; insurance companies are requesting documentation supporting the need for continued monitored care and the infant's hospitalization is extended while everyone waits. Families verbalize frustration, as infants remain stable during sleep, oral feedings, and other physical activities and seem ready for discharge.1 However, a subset of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) patients exhibits frequent desaturations while positioned in a rear-facing semireclined car safety seat. The etiology of the desaturations during sitting is likely multifactorial. Reportedly, these are infants who have intermittent cardiorespiratory instability, neurodevelopmental immaturity, or cannot maintain adequate oxygen saturations when additional metabolic expenditures are required to sit, stabilize the neck, and protect the airway.2,3 These situations are sometimes remedied through the use of a car bed.3 The car bed is a specialized travel restraint device that accommodates infants in a fully reclined position.4 The infant is secured to the bed through the use of an internal harness, and the car bed is placed perpendicular to the direction of travel in the back seat using the vehicular seat belt devices.3 Car beds are typically used for 4 to 8 weeks postdischarge. As the infant grows and ages, maturation of both neurological and muscular systems allows a successful transition to the rear-facing infant car seat. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) reports no current data is available, which establishes a specific age or neurodevelopmental status in which the NICU graduate can safely transition from the car bed to the semireclined rear-facing car safety seat.3 A repeat car seat challenge or test is conducted in the outpatient setting. The infant is secured in a size-appropriate rear-facing infant safety seat and tested using oximetry and/or heart rate monitoring to confirm adequate oxygen saturation without bradycardia is maintained while in the sitting position. Testing is usually conducted by the primary care provider, occupational, or physical therapist.4 The most common car bed used for neonatal discharge is the Angel Ride Infant Car Bed, manufactured by Angel Guard.5 In a recent letter to customers, the company has suspended manufacturing of this product citing reasons that include \"low volume sales\" and a \"growing cost of quality product liability insurance for specialty infant products.\"5 Unfortunately, we in the NICU have come to depend on this product with few acceptable options to provide our parents a car bed for discharge. Although a few of these beds remain available through secondary markets, it will not be long before this model is gone forever. Optional car beds on the market are the \"HOPE Car Bed\" by Merritt Manufacturing Inc6 and the \"Dream Ride LATCH Infant Car Bed\" by Cosco. The HOPE car bed provides a safe travel solution for the child with specialized health needs. This larger bed fits infants from 4.5 to 35 lb and is typically used for those children who are not able to use a typical car safety seat. This bed is large and takes up most of the space on the back seat but is ideal for those children discharged with a giant omphalocele, Pavlik harness, spica cast, osteogenesis imperfecta, or other conditions. The infant is restrained by a series of harness and a cummerbund, which can be adjusted and individualized to meet the needs of the specialized infant/child.6 The Dream Ride Car Bed is manufactured with support and safety features to provide rear seat support in a lying position. This car bed is designed for infants weighing between 5 and 20 lb and between 19\" and 26\" (48.3-66 cm) in length. To best meet this growing population of preterm infants, manufacturers of traditional rear-facing semireclined infant car seats report increased production of products that are safety tested for infants 4 lb and above. This may provide more options for the smallest patient who demonstrates cardiorespiratory stability during the car seat oximetry safety test offered in most NICUs prior to discharge. Ultimately, we have a charge for car seat safety upon hospital discharge from the AAP.3 The recommendations specific for preterm and low birth-weight infants include \"Rear-facing car safety seats provide the best protection in a frontal crash because the forces are transferred from the back of the restraint to the infant's back, the strongest part of an infant's body. The restraint also supports the infant's head. Severe tensile forces on the neck in flexion are also prevented by use of rear-facing car safety seats.\"3 Whether you are a car bed fan or not, when they are no longer available, we will be forced to offer clear explanations, patience, and assurance to parents whose discharge is delayed until car seat testing is successful. Perhaps the time to examine our lack of standardized practice surrounding oximetry car seat safety checks for infant discharge has come.",

This article provides a discussion about the importance of an annual reunion for former NICU infants, their families, and neonatal staff. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to explain the impact of the NICU reunion on families and neonatal healthcare providers and describe the experience of organizing this reunion over the past 20 years. Methods: This is a description of how a NICU reunion was organized at a regional neonatal center. Graphic-designed invitations were e-mailed to NICU graduates, who previously agreed to being contacted, 2 months prior to the reunion date. Social media were utilized to publicize the event on the hospital's Web site. Results: At the reunion, parents and families introduced their NICU graduate to the neonatal staff who cared for them while hospitalized. Sometimes staff found it difficult to recognize the NICU graduates, who were toddlers or older. Parents were relaxed, expressing their appreciation for care received. Implications for Practice: The impact of seeing an infant, born at 24 weeks, now walking, talking, and running cultivates pride in the NICU healthcare team. The reunion adds a positive dimension to the work of NICU caregivers. Parents look forward to attending the reunion to reconnect with NICU staff and other NICU parents. Implications for Research: Directions for future study include a comparison of staff and families who attend the NICU reunion and those who do not, by using a survey or online evaluation tool, to improve future reunions.",

Identification of this skin injury can be misinterpreted as a pressure ulcer. However, this phenomenon is now accepted as an early sign of impending death among critically ill adults.This case study describes TB-TTI in a terminally ill infant in a neonatal intensive care unit evidenced by intact, 2-cm oval skin discoloration on the lateral side of both knees with rapid progression in size.TB-TTI was identified on the day of death in an infant with a primary diagnosis of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy born at 32 weeks' gestation.The neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) team mobilized the NICU advanced care team, institution's ethical council, and \"Team Lavender\" to provide infant comfort measures and emotional support to the family and care givers.Infant death occurred 8 hours after TB-TTI was identified.To our knowledge, this case study of TB-TTI in a terminally ill neonate in the NICU has not been previously described in the neonatal or pediatric population. Early recognition of the phenomenon can enable the healthcare team to provide timely emotional, spiritual, and psychosocial support to the family and allow time to \"be present\" with the infant at \"end of life.\" Future work should explore additional signs of TB-TTI and the occurrence rate.",

Medically stable infants under supervision in a newborn intensive care unit (NICU) can and should be immunized. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore attitudes and knowledge in NICU nurses regarding 2-month immunizations. Methods: Participants were attendees of the National Association of Neonatal Nurses (NAAN) 33rd Annual Conference. Participants responded to a survey that focused on knowledge and attitudes regarding 2-month immunizations. Findings/Results: A total of 188 nurses attending the NAAN conference completed the survey. Most nurses had positive attitudes regarding immunizations. A majority (n = 117, 62.5%) of NICU nurses knew that immunizations should be given to medically stable infants in a NICU. However, as few as 27% of participants were able to identify recommended 2-month immunizations. Almost two-thirds of participants (n = 115, 61.1%) did not know current guidelines regarding minimum age at the time of administration of immunizations, although NPs were more likely to know current guidelines. Nurse practitioners were more comfortable talking family about immunizations and were more likely to view that the illnesses prevented by vaccines as serious. Implications for Practice: NICU nurses would benefit from continued education focused on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for 2-month immunizations. Additionally, as a primary source of information for parents, NICU nurses should be encouraged to practice teaching parents and family about immunizations. This practice could reinforce nurse knowledge. Implications for Research: Further research regarding the effect of education, simulation, and yearly reinforcement of CDC guidelines could further enlighten our knowledge on this topic.",

Diagnosis may be suspected antenatally with a combination of polyhydramnios, associated with a small or absent stomach bubble or other anomalies. Esophageal atresia can be suspected postnatally in the presence of tachypnea, increased oral secretions, and an inability to advance an orogastric tube. Failure to recognize an esophageal atresia can have life-threatening implications. Clinical Findings: A 5-day-old infant with a history of failure to thrive and respiratory distress presented in a community emergency department following a prolonged apnea associated with a breastfeed. Primary Diagnosis: Delayed postnatal diagnosis of esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula. Interventions: During stabilization in the emergency department, a nasogastric tube was placed to decompress the stomach. A subsequent chest and abdominal radiograph identified the nasogastric tube curled in the upper esophagus, confirming an esophageal atresia. The abdominal radiograph demonstrated gaseous distension, suggesting the presence of a distal tracheoesophageal fistula. Outcomes: The neonate had a primary esophageal anastomosis and fistula ligation in a surgical neonatal unit. He was discharged home at 29 days of life.

Purpose: The purpose of this qualitative, exploratory study was to explore former neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) parents' attitudes toward engagement as parent collaborators and identify potential barriers and facilitators to parent collaboration in research. Methods: Three focus groups and 3 interviews were conducted. Participants completed a demographic survey including information about their child's hospitalization. Parents were asked to discuss their NICU story, involvement in the parent community, experience with research, and factors influencing their decision to collaborate on a research study. Results: Nine parents completed the study. Participation was motivated by a desire to help other families. Recruitment suggestions included using parent organizations, social media networks, and advertising in the NICU. Facilitators to research engagement were passion about research topic, distance participation, affecting change, helping other parents, and compensation. Barriers included time constraints and unresolved trauma. Implications for Practice: NICU nurses can leverage their relationships with parents to act as liaisons between research teams and parents, helping recruit and encouraging them to form research partnerships. Implications for Research: Parents are interested in collaborating with neonatal research teams when they can improve experiences for other families and can see or help implement change. Researchers should be conscious of constraints on parents' ability to meet frequently or in person and offer accommodations such as conference calls and online training.",

One approach may be minimizing use of low-value care by reducing the number of unnecessary neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions through the use of official neonatal transition beds.To evaluate whether transition beds decrease unnecessary NICU admissions and estimate the cost savings of this practice change.This retrospective chart review examined the records of all neonates of 350/7 weeks' gestational age and greater with birth weights of 2000 g and more admitted to a neonatal transition bed from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2017. Outcomes evaluated were number of neonates returned to their mothers and an estimate of dollars saved for a 1-year period.A total of 194 neonates were admitted to transition beds, which resulted in 144 NICU admissions averted. Respiratory distress was the most common reason for admission to transition beds. There was a statistically significant difference in length of stay in transition beds between neonates admitted to the NICU and those returned to couplet care after admission to transition beds (135.92 minutes vs 159.27 minutes; P = .047). There was no difference in gestational age based on admission to NICU or returned to couplet care (37.9 weeks vs 38 weeks; P = .772). The estimated cost savings was $3000 per neonate returned to couplet care totaling $432,000 annually.The use of neonatal transition beds is a potential strategy to decrease unnecessary NICU admissions and reduce low value care.Research regarding potential benefits of transition beds including the effect on hospital resources and low-value care at other institutions is needed. Additional research regarding potential benefits to the family including parent satisfaction and the effect of transition beds on rates of breastfeeding and skin-to-skin care is important.",

    "abstract": "As a former Editor-in-Chief, I am honored to be invited to write one of the guest editorials celebrating the 20th anniversary of Advances in Neonatal Care (ANC). The importance of publishing a journal was not lost on the National Association of Neonatal Nurses (NANN) board of directors 20 years ago. It was clear that the association needed a vehicle to share information, knowledge, and research that impacted neonatal nursing. Indeed, that is one of the functions of a professional association—to advance the education and practice of the professionals that the organization serves.1 We have been privileged over the last 20 years to have talented authors, reviewers, editorial board members, and editors who have made ANC a trusted vehicle to share knowledge and discovery with our colleagues in neonatal care. We live in an age where we are inundated with “information,” some of it good and much of it not very good at all. One only needs to spend a few minutes on social media to find realms of misinformation. Consequently, it is more important than ever that we keep up with what is new and can sort out what is reliable information and what is not. Lack of discernment leads to proliferation of misinformation, sometimes leading to tragic consequences, such as the spread of communicable diseases that are easily prevented with vaccinations. As nurses, we cannot engage in this. A reputable, peer-reviewed journal such as ANC is important to make sure neonatal nurses have scientific, up-to-date information. In fact, the very mission of ANC includes the words “publication of scientifically sound and clinically relevant articles that enhance intradisciplinary care.” So why is this so important? The following are only a few of the reasons why nurses must stay engaged and informed. RAPIDLY CHANGING NEONATAL CARE A colleague and I were recently asked to give a talk on “Dangerous Things We Used to Do in Neonatology.” I wish I could say that it was difficult to find examples. Unfortunately, there were many examples of things we used to do that have since been found to be dangerous, useless, or unsubstantiated. In the scheme of things, neonatology is a relatively young field. Neonatal intensive care units were virtually nonexistent 60 years ago.2 Much has changed in neonatal medicine and nursing. Significant advances in respiratory care, nutrition, and surgical care have been made. Thanks to the hard work and diligence of nursing scholars, the nursing care provided in the 1970s and 1980s has vastly improved. Much of what we have learned in neonatal care, including, but not limited to, nutrition, feeding practices, family-centered care, developmental care, and care of the substance-exposed newborn, comes from the nursing research. An association journal provides an avenue to publish new discoveries and to review solid information that is available. Improvement in care comes not only from rigorous research but also from the practice of nurses who stay informed and translate the research into practice. As evidence-based practice has become the accepted standard, our clinical practice must be guided by the best possible evidence. Nurses have a responsibility to maintain knowledge and competency.3,4 The American Nurses Association Standards of Practice include integrating evidence and research findings into practice.4 This includes conducting research, using research findings, employing critical thinking skills to connect research and practice, and integrating research into quality improvement.4 It is not okay to just show up for your shift and complete the assigned patient tasks. Nurses must be knowledgeable, up-to-date, and engaged in practice. We spend a lot of time in education talking about critical thinking. However, to engage in critical thinking or the creation of new knowledge, we must have a rich body of knowledge to begin with. This requires reading and learning what others have already discovered.5 A foundation of basic knowledge is essential, and because neonatal care is always advancing and the need to know continues to advance along with it. PUBLIC POLICY ENGAGEMENT Nursing has long been considered the most trusted profession.6 This requires practicing according to accepted standards and current, relevant knowledge. It also means partnering in a community engagement. It also calls for safeguarding nursing practice in the face of public and business policies that fail to put patient care front and center. Staffing issues, access to care, and healthcare quality are important topics that nurses must address. This requires knowledge. Providing evidence regarding healthcare outcomes is imperative to be credible when working to enact change.7 This requires keeping abreast of what is new and where problems exist. Nurses also have the responsibility to inform the public. This includes educating our patients and being a source of reliable information. Being reliable means being educated and up-to-date on information. It means having a solid foundation of science and medicine. One cannot, for instance, educate others on vaccinations without a solid foundation on how the immune system actually works. To be educated, we need to be proactive in reading, attending conferences, and remaining engaged as lifelong learners. Nurses may be intimidated at the idea of political involvement. However, involvement may include simple steps such as voting, writing letters to representatives, and participating in education about political issues.8 One author noted that fewer nurses voted in 2018 than in 2016 and less than half knew the names of their representatives.8 Increased knowledge of issues facing our patients, the public, and our colleagues increases confidence in the ability to influence change. CAREER SATISFACTION A recent study found that nurses had increased job satisfaction when they were learning and increasing knowledge on a regular basis.9 This should not be a surprise. Increased knowledge leads to increased confidence and sense of well-being. In addition, the perception of being able to solve problems, which is a natural outcome of increased knowledge, was shown to increase nurses' sense of control and power in the workplace.9 Knowledge is power. Neonatal nursing is complex. To provide quality care, and to move the profession forward, requires engagement at all levels. We must not only master knowledge but also generate knowledge. We must then translate that knowledge to practice. If we do not generate, report, and absorb knowledge and then apply it to practice, we will not continue to improve neonatal care. Ultimately, this is the purpose of a specialty nursing organization and the associated journal. So, join your professional association (NANN). Don't merely join, become involved. Most of all, when the journal comes, read it! Then take what you read and put it into practice. —Catherine Witt, PhD, APRN, NNP-BC Dean and Associate Professor Loretto Heights School of Nursing Regis University Denver, Colorado",

    "abstract": "To my neonatal colleagues, I am pleased to introduce a special collection of articles that highlight important work being done to care for some of our most vulnerable infants and their families; Neonatal Palliative, End of Life, and Hospice Care Across Multiple Settings, in issues 2020(2) and 2020(3). In general, an estimated 21 million children around the world are in need of palliative care to treat their life-limiting and life-threatening conditions at any given time.1 Approximately, 6 million of these children live in the United States.2 More than 2 million of these children will die, with up to 55% of deaths occurring in infants younger than 1 year.2,3 This constitutes the highest number of deaths in any pediatric group in the United States.4 Furthermore, about 44 of these infants die PER DAY in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). When we think about the quality of palliative and end-of-life (EOL) care that is received and where it is delivered, the number of parents, siblings, grandparents, and care providers who may be affected by that care increases exponentially. To offer palliative or EOL care is not enough; the delivery of care must be thoughtful for the most benefit to be derived for the patient and the family. The first consideration we must make is to appropriately define both palliative care and EOL care. Both the World Health Organization5 and the American Academy of Pediatrics6 consider palliative care as an overarching concept that begins when an illness is diagnosed, supports the patient and family to relieve suffering across multiple realms (physical, psychological, social, practical, existential, or spiritual), improves quality of life, facilitates informed decision-making, and assists with the ongoing coordination of care among physicians and across sites of care. Palliative care continues across the illness trajectory regardless of whether or not curative treatment is being received, and when and if necessary, it transitions to EOL and bereavement care. The provision of quality palliative and EOL care to pediatric patients who have life-limiting or life-threatening conditions relies on the ability of their providers to refer them for the right care at the appropriate time in their illness trajectory. The definitions that a provider uses to make determinations for care could result in a delay in referral, or even a lack of referral altogether, to either type of care service or both. Even a delay in referral may deny the infants and their family the full benefit that palliative and EOL care services can add to their comfort level and quality of life. For example, an infant diagnosed with a potentially life-threatening or life-limiting diagnosis who is stabilized but then does not respond to aggressive medical treatment and is simultaneously referred to palliative care as the EOL approaches may not receive the same quality of care as an infant who is referred immediately to palliative care on admission to the NICU using his or her life-threatening/life-limiting illness as a trigger for consultation. Timing is critical in these situations as it can be uncomfortable for both parents and palliative care providers to meet under such stressful circumstances and come to consensus on what could or should be done for the infant and the family. The more time that can be allowed for conversations with the family and discovery of their wishes and needs, the better it is to ensure that the outcomes, although not desired, are the best that they can be given the situation. Concrete definitions may improve understanding and remove barriers to providing early referral to, or provision of, palliative and EOL care services. Victoria Kain presents a conceptual definition of neonatal palliative care in 2020(3), but all the articles in this series arise from the viewpoint that palliative care provides comprehensive care to patients and their families throughout an illness, no matter how long or short the duration. The series takes us from moving toward a consistent definition of neonatal palliative care to discovering how palliative care delivery can effectively occur in multiple settings across the continuum from prenatal diagnosis to concurrent care to hospice and through bereavement. Furthermore, the experiences of bereaved parents following stillbirth and neonatal death are presented. Betty Ferrell also discusses how nurses can be best prepared to provide palliative care in the NICU. An increase in provider knowledge of components of palliative care can be facilitated by training that focuses on symptom management, enhanced quality of life, effective communication strategies, and building rapport with families. Advances in prenatal care and the management of high-risk deliveries have significantly contributed to an increase in the numbers of neonates confronting prematurity, congenital anomalies, or other syndromes who survive initial resuscitation efforts in the delivery room and are admitted to the NICU for curative management. The consequence of increased survival is a concomitant increase in the population of neonates who are at risk for life-threatening or life-limiting illness. For some neonates, it becomes apparent that, despite all of the tremendous technical capabilities available to manage their condition, treatment becomes futile and death is inevitable. Once the decision is made to withhold or withdraw treatment, the emphasis must then turn to managing the EOL process. Infants in each of these scenarios and their families deserve the best care that can be delivered by healthcare providers who are well prepared to provide that care to minimize suffering and improve quality of life. It is my pleasure to present to you this in-depth series. I hope you will learn through these thoughtful articles how best practice in neonatal palliative care can be so meaningful to patients and families across multiple settings of care.

    "abstract": "Background: Neonatal intensive care (NICU) providers may experience distress due to controversial orders or the close relationships they form with neonates' families. A “Patient Ethics and Communications Excellence [PEACE] Rounds” intervention developed at Indiana University proved to significantly relieve distress by facilitating interdisciplinary discussions of clinically and ethically challenging issues associated with pediatric intensive care (PICU) patient care. NICU healthcare providers face similar challenges and will benefit from understanding the potential efficacy of PEACE Rounds in this setting. Purpose: This study describes the experiences of NICU healthcare providers who participate in PEACE Rounds and evaluates their perceptions of how it affects their distress levels, contributes to interdisciplinary collaboration, and influences their understanding of ethical decision-making. Methods: Researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 intervention participants, observed 12 interventions, facilitated a validation focus group, and performed a constructionist thematic analysis and triangulation based on data from transcribed recordings. Findings: PEACE Rounds improved interdisciplinary communication and collaboration and demonstrated restorative value through the benefits of voice and collective support. The intervention may reduce, but not replace, the need for formal ethics consultations. Implications for Practice: PEACE Rounds may potentially improve interdisciplinary communications and collaboration, relieve employee distress, and reduce ethics consultations. Implications for Research: Studies of PEACE Rounds undertaken in other clinical settings, and facilitated by a nurse educator, will help assess the potential benefits of greater reach and access and the efficacy of less structured ethics discussions.",

    "abstract": "Dear NANN Colleagues, In 2017, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement published a white paper entitled, “The IHI Framework for Improving Joy in Work.” This white paper outlines in detail why joy at work is important to healthcare delivery with strategies to improve Joy at Work.1 The crux of this publication is that compassion fatigue and burn-out take a toll not just on the individuals but on the organization as a whole such that institutional investment in Joy at Work matters. On average we spend more of our waking hours in the workplace than we do at home with our families, how we spend those hours matters. If we arrive home from work completely depleted by the work; it's unlikely we can recharge enough to continue to provide high quality care the next time we return to the work environment. While caring for infants and their families in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) can seem joyful; we all know it can also be exhausting particularly, if the caring strategies used are not reinforced by others in the workplace. Joy at work can best be achieved by how we work together and how we support each other in the workplace. For example, the nurse who spends several hours working with a family preparing for a NICU discharge might find satisfaction and joy in those activities (a sense of achievement). However, if her/his co-workers believe this time could have been spent better in other ways that satisfaction (joy) could be lost and the nurse in question might become increasingly dissatisfied over time. Some would call the above scenario “joy stealing.” This type of behavior could make the workplace dreary and no fun. It also increases the potential for a nurse to leave the organization, which is costly to all involved and could decrease the overall quality of care provided. Dissatisfaction in the workplace is big business. Retention strategies are all about increasing satisfaction and although salary and raises matter they are not totally what keeps an employee in the workplace. How we support each other matters. How we engage in the workplace and work together to make it a better place, matters. Improving the places, we work within must come from within, it does not come from administration or a particular leader it must come from within each of us. If we are dissatisfied in our work, then it's likely to spread to others – almost like wildfire. So, what we do we when we are dissatisfied matters. Do we complain? Do we blame our co-workers? Our bosses? Or do we reflect and consider how we can make the workplace better. Many would say that Joy at Work is about attitude. The attitude we each bring with us into the workplace. The saying “today is a good day to have a good day”, reflects this belief. How we each decide to engage in the workplace matters. Many organizations are investing in values about workplace engagement. This may seem like just a benefit to the organization and that is true however, it is also a benefit to the employees that work there. A positive environment is one where there is more likely to be creativity, effectiveness, and overall positive outcomes. Risk-taking to generate new and more creative ideas to improve care are important to moving forward in a healthcare environment that is ever-changing. The NICU is a stressful environment. We tell families to expect the “roller coaster ride,” but do we tell ourselves the same thing? Do we reflect on how to manage the ride or do we somehow get lost in the chaos and begin to burnout? Be compassionate with yourself, there are strategies that you can build into your day to manage the stress and leave at the end of the day more satisfied. Reflect and discuss with your co-workers about, what makes for a good day in the NICU?1 What are the things you or your co-workers do for infants and families that make you proud? These are the things that provide you a sense of accomplishment at the end of the day. That feeling that you completed the tasks you set out to do and your team worked together to make it happen. During this discussion you could also consider what makes for a “Bad Day”? Items that could come out of that discussion might include feelings of isolation, unfairness or inequity, a lack of autonomy or even lack of psychological safety. Providing voice to these feelings is the first step in overcoming these barriers and increasing teamwork. The NICU is a busy environment and although there are a lot of people in the environment, if we are not a team we cannot provide the best care. For example, the huddles that many units are using to begin their day are a way to highlight the team's efforts to provide high quality care. They are also a means for dividing and conquering a challenging staffing ratio or providing more creative discussions on ways to use the staff support that is available, or even a time to cheer each other on about accomplishments such as improving infection rates or increasing delivery of human milk. But even more importantly they are a time for each of us to remember we are all in this together and together we can make a difference for infants and families. We hope you begin today with a wonderful day – that you are grateful for your co-workers and that you know that without each of you high quality care cannot be delivered. Joy matters and we each have a piece in whether joy exists in our workplace or not. Thank you to our readership and for your submissions to Advances in Neonatal Care, Jacqueline M.

    "abstract": "Background: Ophthalmic examinations are a frequent source of pain and stress in premature infants. There is evidence for the use of supportive interventions during infant ophthalmic examinations to reduce pain and stress, but there are no standard recommendations for their implementation. Purpose: The purpose of this quality improvement project was to implement evidence-based, supportive interventions during ophthalmic examinations in premature infants and evaluate the impact on pain, oxygen saturation, heart rate, bradycardic events, and neonatal stress cues. Methods: A preintervention and intervention group design was used. Primary outcomes were pain and oxygen saturation. Secondary outcomes were heart rate, number of bradycardic events, and number of neonatal stress cues. Independent-sample t tests were used to compare means of the measures in the preintervention and intervention groups. Results: Supportive interventions during ophthalmic examinations significantly reduced infant pain (during and after the examination), number of bradycardic events (during and after the examination), and number of neonatal stress cues (before, during, and after the examination). There was also a trend for supportive interventions to decrease pain before the examination. Implications for Practice: Supportive interventions during ophthalmic examinations are effective in reducing pain, bradycardic events, and neonatal stress cues in premature infants and can be successfully implemented as part of a unit-based protocol. Implications for Research: Future research is needed to determine the long-term outcomes associated with supportive interventions during ophthalmic examinations in premature infants.",

Low rates of oral sucrose use with comfort measures for pain management during minor painful procedures were identified at a level III neonatal intensive care unit. Underutilization of pain management resources occurs despite the availability of evidence-based pain management interventions. Purpose: To improve consistency in the use of oral sucrose solution with comfort measures during peripheral intravenous catheter insertion attempts in the neonatal intensive care unit in patients greater than or equal to 32 0/7th weeks postmenstrual age. Methods: Quality improvement methods were used to implement an evidence-based procedural pain algorithm for minor painful procedures and optimize pain management processes over a 15-week period in a 26-bed, level III neonatal intensive care unit. Results: There was an increase in the average percentage of documented use of sucrose with comfort measures during peripheral intravenous catheter insertion attempts from 20% to 27%. There was a 41% increase in the average presence of a sucrose order indicated for procedural pain. There were improvements in staff knowledge of sucrose dosing and perceived behavior of staff after completing the education. Implications for Practice and Research: Procedural pain management should be used as a quality indicator and guidelines should be established with the support of key stakeholders in neonatal intensive care settings. Future projects should address barriers related to workflow and accessibility of sucrose, include other common needlestick procedures, and expand the role of parent participation in pain management practices.

It is critical that the team managing care of the infant in its first minutes of life follow evidence-based resuscitation guidelines and practices to optimize outcomes for this population. Purpose: To implement a simulation program in a community hospital setting that supports standardized evidence-based delivery room practices of the premature infant born less than 30 weeks' gestation. Methods: Two VLBW emergent delivery scenarios were developed utilizing the neonatal resuscitation program scenario template. Special care nursery interprofessional team members from a community hospital were invited to participate in the simulation program (n = 28). Participants were asked to complete a neonatal version of the Emergency Response Confidence Tool , then view a short presentation related to delivery room management of VLBW infants. Participants attended a simulation program and completed the confidence tool after simulation. The simulation facilitator and unit educator documented team actions during each simulation session. Findings/Results: Fifteen opportunities for improvement within 4 simulation sessions were identified and categorized. Fourteen paired pre- and postsurveys were analyzed. Reported confidence increased in 22 of 23 resuscitation-related items. Implications for Practice: Education and simulation programs providing opportunities to experience high-risk, low-frequency VLBW delivery situations can assist in identifying areas for improvement and may improve team member confidence. Implications for Research: Additional research is needed to assess whether results would be similar if this program were provided at all levels of neonatal care throughout the healthcare system.",

Yet, parents are often not fully involved in important decision-making and care, even when practices are family- and patient-centered. Alberta Family Integrated Care (FICare) is a model of care designed to support integration of parents into their infant's care.The aim of this study was to describe and examine how mothers' work was coordinated by institutional processes when participating in Alberta FICare.We used institutional ethnography to analyze written entries in Alberta FICare parent journals to show points of tension mothers experienced in the NICU.We illustrated the institutional activities that intersect with parental work of being present in the NICU. We argue that the journal text and the primary discourses that mothers are tuned to organize the way they knew and thought about their infant. Managing everyday NICU rules, navigating constant and unexpected changes, and the work of feeding their infant created tension. Mothers focused on milk supply, weight gain, and transition from gavage to nipple feeds. We show how mothers' activities were coordinated by practices that prioritize progression toward discharge rather than supporting them through the roller coaster of emotions and practical challenges of being present in the NICU.This illustration of institutional systems and processes may assist practitioners to understand the barriers mothers face when caring for their infants in the NICU.",

    "abstract": "ALGORITHM FOR HUMAN MILK ACCESS Heather E. Smith, PhD, RN, NNP-BC, CNS Many neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) have their own policies and procedures to provide infants with mother's breast milk (MBM) or donor breast milk (DBM). When a mother is unable to produce her own milk for her child, 2 options remain to continue feeding the infant, formula or DBM. In the case of a premature delivery, many mothers experience delayed lactogenesis, or a lag in human milk production. Separation of the mother and the infant so that the infant can be cared for in the NICU negatively works against the ability for the mother to produce her own milk. Decisions regarding her own milk production of the mother in conjunction with the infant's nutritional needs must be assessed to determine the best route for DBM. One other consideration is the idea that in some situations the use of DBM might be overused.1 To help with making the decision for the proper feeding option, a decision tree was developed.2 At a glance, the process flow may appear to be busy indicating the complexity and various variables needing consideration, but the process provides a good algorithm for methodically coming to consistent decisions while optimizing MBM instead of DBM. NICUs needing more consistent guidance for how to determine infant milk options, the Decision Tree for Donor Human Milk might be a helpful tool. REDUCING NEUROLOGICAL RISK FOR ALL PREMATURE INFANTS A recent study presented at the European Academy of Paediatric Society Meeting looked at 2 methods to decrease the risk of neurological problems commonly occurring in premature infants.3 The researchers enrolled 103 premature infants (born less than 37 weeks' gestation and weighing no more than 1.6 kg) to assess the use of the drug topiramate and a cooling blanket. Topiramate is an anticonvulsant used primarily in older children and adults for epilepsy and migraines that blocks glutamate receptors.4 Typically, cooling blankets are used for infants who have experienced asphyxia during the prenatal, intrapartum, or postnatal period.5 Infants were randomized into 2 groups: (1) 1 dose of topiramate per day for the first 3 days of life plus standard of care and (2) standard of care only. Five infants who received topiramate showed moderate to severe brain injury compared with 13 infants in the standard of care group. After follow-up at 2 years of age, infants who had been in the topiramate group had less cognitive and developmental delays compared with the group who did not receive topiramate. The late preterm infants (32-37 weeks' gestation) within this study received topiramate and were wrapped in a cooling blanket rather than in the conventional warm blanket. Of those 16 late preterm infants who received both therapies, only 1 infant showed developmental delays at 2 years of age. Researchers concluded that further data are needed to understand if these 2 treatments should be applied across the board for all premature infants. However, this study shows promise for 2 potential options that may reduce the risk for premature infants with neurological problems. TELEHEALTH AND TELEMEDICINE NURSING In the last decade or so, the idea of telemedicine has picked up as a trend to serve a healthcare need virtually. In 2010, the World Health Organization wrote a lengthy paper to provide a global assessment of the telemedicine need and status.6 With technological advances becoming more common and healthcare needs going beyond the 4 walls of a hospital or clinic, telemedicine is offering the opportunity for healthcare to reach beyond an in-person visit to a virtual consultation via phone or video. Telemedicine bridges the gap between the healthcare provider and a patient's needs when in-person access is not possible or available. Today, nursing is becoming more involved with telemedicine. Nurse practitioner programs are incorporating the use of robots to learn how to assess and care for a patient remotely.7 Much of telemedicine efforts have been aimed at populations and diseases with the least risk and effort, but telemedicine has made its way to the NICU.8 How can telemedicine help your unit? Will remote visibility to an unexpected high-risk birth help to verify that an infant can stay at a level 2 nursery or need to be transferred to a level 3? Nervous parents at 2 am in the morning could utilize telemedicine by downloading an app and videoconferencing with a nurse to make sure their child does not need to go to the hospital. There is a place and a role for nurses to provide telemedicine. How do you see yourself fitting in to remote care?",

    "abstract": "Just as race is a social and political construct, so is gender.1 As we continue to work toward eliminating inequities and health disparities experienced by patients and families in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), we need to be more purposeful in our inclusion of LGBTQ+, specifically gender nonconforming, perspectives. One strategy to increase purposeful inclusion is using inclusive language. The importance of gender-neutral language is recognized and supported internationally. However, word choice can be complicated, sensitive, and personal, especially for families experiencing the trauma of an NICU admission. A delicate balance between providing representation for the LGBTQ+ population and avoiding alienation of the majority, cisgender people who feel wholly represented by the terms “mother” and “father” is required. This editorial is meant to begin a conversation with the goal of ensuring inclusivity through mindful, expansive language, both in the NICU setting and in our publication. There is a biological basis upon which sex is determined, but this is not as simple as the binary terms “male” and “female” imply. An example of this is the intersex population. As NICU nurses, we may see infants diagnosed with ambiguous genitalia. Historically, these infants would undergo extensive testing, consultation with the family and healthcare providers, and genital surgery. It was assumed that the child's gender identity would conform to the genitalia they had been assigned. This assumption was later challenged by reports of long-term follow-up of children who had sex reassignment surgery in infancy struggling throughout childhood with nonconforming gender wishes and behaviors, with up to 40% rejecting the gender assignment they had been given at birth.2,3 Approximately one in 58 people can be classified as intersex, with at least 40 variations in biological sexual characteristics ranging from genes to hormones to internal and external genital appearance.4 The current recommendation for infants born with ambiguous genitalia is to provide genetic and hormonal testing so that parents can have a sense of the direction in which gender identity may go, but to forgo unnecessary genital surgery until the child is at an age to make the decision for themself.4,5 With our growing understanding of the complexities of biological sex, we have come to realize that gender identity is similarly complex. The recognition that gender identity is determined by more than psychosocial experiences during childhood and/or genitalia exposes the inherent expectations and biases associated with being identified as male or female. The acknowledgment of these biases, as well as the need to respect the rights of the individual to self-identify, is reflected at a basic level by asking people to state their preferences for their pronouns (eg, she/her/hers, he/him/his, they/them/their, etc). The need for patient-specific gender inclusive language has only recently been reflected in policies of several perinatal healthcare organizations and publications.6–10 The health inequities associated with the lack of knowledge surrounding LGBTQ+ issues and needs demonstrate a need for policy change; examining language for inclusivity is a necessary first step. Gender nonconforming and LGBTQ+ individuals are marginalized and discriminated against in healthcare.11 This can be especially true when seeking reproductive care.12 Not all people who give birth identify as women. Likewise, not all people who have given birth want to be referred to as mothers. We acknowledge that motherhood and fatherhood have cultural and personal significance, and we are not suggesting that we erase these terms. Traditional gender expectations play a role in the experiences of parents in the NICU and to ignore this would be a disservice to providing individualized family-centered care. One of the most important aspects of the use of inclusive language is to avoid making assumptions. It is best practice to establish and maintain open communication and to increase comfort for all participants by first discussing preferred terms and pronouns for individuals. However, we must also adapt our language when speaking broadly about families to ensure that our words reflect a culture of inclusion in the NICU. Within healthcare systems, the use of nongendered terms surrounding the perinatal period must be considered best practice. This could include using “postpartum unit” rather than “mother–baby unit” or “perinatal center” instead of “maternity center.” This change in language could provide gender nonconforming individuals with the reassurance that they would find sensitive and appropriate care within our facilities. The implementation of these changes, as well as when and how to begin the conversation with parents, can be the next steps in increasing inclusivity. The publication policies of journals concerning the use of inclusive language must be consistent with practices in healthcare organizations. When reporting demographics regarding infants, it should be considered standard to report sex rather than gender, as gender would require speculation and assumptions. Language concerning infant feeding can follow the guidelines suggested by the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine and may include terms such as “breastfeeding,” “chestfeeding,” “lactating,” or “human milk feeding.”9 “Parent” would be the preferred term for a parent of any gender unless using the terms “mother” or “father”” would be needed to provide clarity. When necessary, combining the use of gendered terms with gender-neutral language (eg, “mothers and gestational parents,” “lactating mothers and parents,” “fathers and nongestational parents,” etc) aligns with recommendations from national and international organizations9,13–15 and allows for representation that is both inclusive and expansive. Currently, there is a lack of research regarding the experience of LGBTQ+ families in the NICU. As we expand our knowledge and aim for inclusivity and equity, we must continue to advocate for this population and include language that represents all the families that we serve. To ensure that the language we use reflects the needs of these families, we should work directly with groups and individuals that represent those interests. Neonatology is an evolving field, as is the study of sex and gender. Our language must evolve along with the science. Brittany L.

    "abstract": "Neonatal patients who no longer require level IV neonatal intensive care unit care are transferred to less acute levels of care. Standardized assessment tools have been shown to be beneficial in the transfer of patient care. However, no standardized tools were available to assist neonatal providers in the assessment and communication of the infants needs at transfer.The purpose was to develop a Transfer Assessment and Communication Tool (TACT) that guides provider decision making in the transfer of infants from a level IV neonatal intensive care unit to a less acute level of care within a regionalized healthcare system.Phase 1 included developing the first draft of the TACT using retrospective data, known variables from published literature, and study team expertise. In phase 2, the final draft of the TACT was created through feedback from expert neonatal providers in the regionalized care system using e-Delphi methodology.The first draft of the TACT, developed in phase 1, included 36 characteristics. In phase 2, nurses, nurse practitioners, and physician experts representing all levels of newborn care participated in 4 e-Delphi surveys to develop the final draft of the TACT, which included 74 weighted characteristics.Potential benefits of the TACT include improved communication across healthcare teams, reduced risk for readmission, and increased caregiver visitation. The next steps are to validate the TACT for use either retrospectively or in real time, including characteristic weights, before implementation of this tool in the clinical setting.",

    "abstract": "Background: A natural disaster can have devastating consequences for newborn infants. Despite this fact, there are few studies that have explored household emergency preparedness (HEP) among parents of newborn infants or factors affecting HEP in this population. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between various demographic and socioeconomic variables and levels of HEP among parents of newborn infants. Methods: Parents of newborn infants born at a single medical center in Brooklyn, New York, completed a pre- and posttest to determine their level of HEP before and after implementing the Nurses Taking on Readiness Measures (N-TORM) intervention. For this study, a secondary statistical analysis was performed on the HEP scores gathered prior to the intervention and the demographic data collected from participants. Results: There was a statistically significant relationship between HEP scores and homeownership t (62) = 2.75, P = .008, level of education t (66) = 2.31, P = .024, and income t (46) = 2.39, P = .021. Implications for Practice and Research: Findings from this study indicate that there are various demographic and socioeconomic factors that influence HEP. Another critical finding was that most participants were significantly underprepared for an emergency with an average HEP score of 4.75 (SD = 2.61) out of a possible 11 points. Findings from this study support the need for neonatal and pediatric providers to develop targeted interventions to enhance the preparedness of parents of newborns in general, and in particular, those with lower household incomes, lower levels of education, and those who rent their homes.",

    "abstract": "REEMERGENCE OF VITAMIN K DEFICIENCY BLEEDING Late last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported1 a cluster of cases of late-onset vitamin K–deficiency bleeding (VKDB) that occurred in 4 infants born in Nashville, Tennessee, whose parents had declined routine vitamin K prophylaxis in the newborn period. Late-onset VKDB is a coagulopathy that can occur in exclusively breastfed infants between the ages of 2 and 24 weeks, resulting in potentially life-threatening hemorrhage. The clinical presentation is severe, with intracranial hemorrhaging in 50%, and persistent neurological damage is common in survivors. Mortality rate is reported to be 20%.2 Like classic VKDB, late-onset VKDB is preventable with the administration of a single dose of parenteral (but not oral) vitamin K after birth. In the Tennessee cluster, the infants all had been developing normally until they exhibited sudden symptomatic bleeding at the age of 6 to 15 weeks. One of the 4 infants suffered a gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and the other 3 infants were diagnosed with diffuse intracranial hemorrhages. One of these infants is already showing signs of a gross motor deficit. The parents of the 4 infants with late-onset VKDB were asked why they declined vitamin K prophylaxis for their babies. Their reasons included concern about an increased risk for leukemia when vitamin K is administered, an impression that the injection was unnecessary, and a desire to minimize their newborn's exposure to “toxins.”1 Most claimed to be unaware of the delayed risk for bleeding. Vitamin K administration has been a routine practice in newborn care since 1961. A records review conducted in 2013 showed that 3.4% of neonates were discharged from a Tennessee hospital and 28% from a Tennessee birth center without receiving vitamin K.1 It is tempting to speculate that parental refusal of vitamin K administration was responsible for these omissions; however, nationwide shortages of phytonadione were ongoing in 2013. Still, research suggests that even well-educated parents need balanced information about the reasons that newborns need vitamin K, and the risks to infants who do not receive it, particularly in a breastfeeding population.3 1.

SURFACTANT: A CLINICAL REPORT Surfactant was the first drug developed solely for the treatment of neonates,1 and a major breakthrough in the care of preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Surfactant replacement, given as prophylaxis or rescue treatment, reduces the incidence of RDS and air leaks and lowers mortality rate in preterm infants with RDS but it has not been shown to affect the incidence of neurologic, developmental, behavioral, medical, or educational outcomes in preterm infants.2 In a clinical report, the American Academy of Pediatrics reaffirms the important role that surfactant plays in the management of respiratory failure in the neonate.2 The statement summarizes the evidence concerning the indications, administration, formulations, and outcomes for surfactant-replacement therapy in neonates, and the clinical strategy of intubation, surfactant administration, and extubation to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Four clinical recommendations are offered as a result of a comprehensive review of the current state of the science on surfactant2: Preterm infants born at less than 30 weeks' gestation who need mechanical ventilation because of severe RDS should be given surfactant after initial stabilization. Using CPAP immediately after birth with subsequent selective surfactant administration should be considered as an alternative to routine intubation with prophylactic or early surfactant administration in preterm infants. Rescue surfactant may be considered for infants with hypoxic respiratory failure attributable to secondary surfactant deficiency (eg, pulmonary hemorrhage, meconium aspiration syndrome, or sepsis/pneumonia). Preterm and term neonates who are receiving surfactant should be managed by nursery and transport personnel with the technical and clinical expertise to administer surfactant safely and deal with multisystem illness. Providers who are inexperienced with surfactant administration or managing an infant who has received surfactant should wait for the transport team to arrive. 1. Speer CP, Sweet DG, Halliday HL. Surfactant therapy: past, present and future. Early Hum Dev. 2013;89(suppl 1):S22–S24. 2. Carlo WA, Polin RA, and Committee on Fetus and Newborn. Surfactant replacement therapy for preterm and term neonates with respiratory distress. Pediatrics. 2014;133:156–163. RESPIRATORY SUPPORT FOR PRETERM INFANTS: A POLICY STATEMENT For many infants, CPAP is as good as or better than prophylactic surfactant or intubating the infant just for the purpose of providing surfactant. That is one of the conclusions of a literature review about respiratory support for preterm infants published by the American Academy of Pediatrics.1 Current practice guidelines recommend the administration of surfactant at or soon after birth in preterm infants with RDS. However, recent multicenter randomized controlled trials indicate that early use of CPAP with subsequent selective surfactant administration in extremely preterm infants results in lower rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia/death when compared with treatment with prophylactic or early surfactant therapy. Continuous positive airway pressure started at or soon after birth with subsequent selective surfactant administration may be considered as an alternative to routine intubation with prophylactic or early surfactant administration in preterm infants. Preterm infants treated with early CPAP alone are not at increased risk for adverse outcomes if treatment with surfactant is delayed or not given at all. The early initiation of CPAP may lead to a reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation and postnatal corticosteroid therapy. If it is likely that respiratory support with a ventilator will be needed, early administration of surfactant followed by rapid extubation is preferable to prolonged ventilation. Finally, infants with RDS can vary markedly in the severity of the respiratory disease, maturity, and presence of other complications, and thus it is necessary to individualize patient care. Care for these infants is provided in various care settings, and the capabilities of the healthcare team must be considered. 1. American Academy of Pediatrics. Committee on Fetus and Newborn. Respiratory support in preterm infants at birth. Pediatrics. 2014;113:171–174. AND WHAT ABOUT THOSE OXYGEN SATURATION TARGETS? We have been going back and forth for years about the optimal oxygen saturation targets for preterm infants, like Goldilocks trying to decide between “too high,” “too low,” and “just right.” The real problem is that infants fluctuate so much that it is extremely difficult to keep their oxygen saturation levels within the desired ranges, whatever those may be. A recent study found that preterm infants' pulse oxygen saturation (Spo2) levels at 2 neonatal intensive care units were within the targeted range of 88% to 92% only 31% of the time, spending 59% of the time in hyperoxia (≥93%) and 9% of the time in hypoxia (≤87%).1 The optimal oxygen saturation range for extremely low-birth-weight infants in the postnatal period beyond the delivery room is not known. Aiming too low increases the risk for cellular injury and mortality, and aiming too high raises risks for retinopathy of prematurity and blindness. A recent meta-analysis, called the NEOPROM2 (Neonatal Oxygenation Prospective Meta-analysis), summarized existing randomized trials examining the effect of low versus high functional oxygen saturation targets in the postnatal period in premature infants with gestational age less than 28 weeks. These trials included the SUPPORT (Surfactant, Positive Pressure and Pulse Oximetry Randomized Trial), the 3 BOOST II (Benefits of Oxygen Saturation Targeting) studies, and the COT (Canadian Oxygen Trial). Combined, these trials provided data on 4911 infants who were randomized within the first 24 hours after birth to either a low (85%-89%) or high (91%-95%) SpO2 group. Mortality and necrotizing entercolitis were significantly increased, and severe retinopathy of prematurity was significantly reduced in low compared with high oxygen saturation target infants. One extra infant is at risk for death for every 2 cases of severe retinopathy of prematurity prevented. There were no differences in physiologic bronchopulmonary dysplasia, brain injury, or patent ductus arteriosus between the low and high target groups. On the basis of these results, it is suggested that functional SpO2 should be targeted at 90% to 95% in infants with gestational age less than 28 weeks' until 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. Saugstad and colleagues2 suggest that the increased mortality rate in the low saturation group might be explained by the higher rate of intermittent hypoxemia events observed in infants with low saturation targets. A higher SpO2 target is also very difficult to maintain without risking a high proportion of time spent in hyperoxia, as shown in the study by Lim and colleagues.1 It is doubtful that we have reached the end of this story. 1.

FOCUSING ON FATHERS Some fathers in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are right there with the mothers, holding, feeding, changing diapers—even doing skin-to-chest hair. Some are rarely seen, if ever, or are present only to read the chart and challenge the nurses. Somewhere in the middle are most fathers, trying to figure out how to be a supportive husband and father during a very difficult and stressful time. No doubt, the role of the father in the NICU can be a puzzling one. Is he just a go-between for the mother and the anxious relatives in the waiting room? Does he matter at all to the new little life in the incubator? With the premise that fathers do matter, neonatal nurses in Iran used the resources of the HUG (HUG stands for Help–Understanding–Guidance) program, which included an educational DVD, a handout, and one-on-one time with an HUG educator, to increase new fathers' knowledge and confidence levels and promote the parent-child relationship of fathers with their preterm babies in the NICU. Fathers in the intervention group demonstrated higher levels of knowledge about preterm infant behavior, and lower levels of stress, than fathers in the control group.1 HUG Your Baby (http://www.hugyourbaby.org) is a Durham, North Carolina–based international program that trains new mothers and fathers in parenting techniques, with resources for both parents and professionals who work with new parents. HUG's leadership includes representatives from the United States, Korea, Japan, and Iran. 1. Kadivar M, Mozafarinia SM.

    "abstract": "Background: Infants with chronic lung disease tend to be difficult to care for due to the heterogeneous nature of both their disease and the treatments required. Multiple types of medications, treatments, and nursing interventions are often needed to attain clinical success, and it is frequently difficult to discern which are effective versus the ones that offer no benefit. This article presents a case study that chronicles the care of an infant with chronic lung disease treated with albuterol. An innovative form of ventilation with monitoring of the electrical activity of the diaphragm with a special sensor-embedded catheter is used to assess the effectiveness of albuterol administration. Purpose: This case study presents the monitoring of the effectiveness of albuterol in an infant with chronic lung disease measuring the electrical activity of the diaphragm catheter (Edi) and the various monitoring systems on the Servo-i ventilator in Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) Mode. Case Findings/Results: The clinicians followed various respiratory trends monitored by the Servo-i ventilator after albuterol dosing to document the clinical utility of using albuterol in this infant. The monitoring provided by NAVA showed an improvement in both lung mechanics and clinical condition immediately after albuterol administration. Implications for Practice: The infant had a positive response to albuterol dosing that subsequently led to reduced length of stay, reduced costs, and reduced family anxiety. This type of monitoring could help nurses and clinicians discern whether a given treatment or medication was effective. Implications for Research: This method of clinical monitoring could provide a means to assess clinical utility of respiratory medications, treatments, and nursing interventions in certain populations of neonates and infants. The impact of objective monitoring on required sedation, weight gain, ventilator days, length of hospitalization, and overall hospital costs are other possible areas for future research.",

Our reviewer guidelines, updated in December 2014, provide information about the technical aspects of using Editorial Manager as well as how to complete the detailed review. In this editorial, we provide you with information about the key ingredients in a good manuscript review. Before accepting a reviewer assignment you must ask yourself 3 questions: Do I have the substantive knowledge to conduct the review? This does not mean you must be an expert in every aspect of the manuscript and or project design. So consider even if the topic is an area of expertise when the project design is not, or vice versa. Your review will still be valuable to the author. We invite 3 reviewers to participate in a manuscript review because we expect that their reviews will complement each other and provide a broader, more objective review of the relevance of the work. Do I have the time to conduct the review within the editor's suggested time frame? Do I have any potential or actual conflicts of interest? An example of a conflict would be a financial interest in a product discussed in the manuscript. If you have a potential conflict, you do not have to decline the reviewer invitation, but you should inform the editor so that the editor can make an informed decision. Consider the following organizing process for conducting the review: Read the entire manuscript before beginning the detailed critique. After the initial reading of the manuscript, you should have a good idea of the authors' primary goal(s). Very experienced reviewers may be ready to begin the detailed written reviews depending upon the quality of the manuscript. However, multiple reads are likely depending upon the quality of the manuscript and the reviewer's experience. General questions you should be able to answer with the initial readings include:Do the authors provide novel or updated information?Is the manuscript well written, clear, and concise (free of repetition)?How can the manuscript be improved? Your ideas about how the manuscript can be improved will provide the substance for your written review.The review text should include the following:A summary paragraph describing the purpose of the manuscript and the novel or updated contribution. If you have difficulty writing this paragraph, then the quality of the manuscript will likely require major revisions and therefore your specific feedback will need to be extensive to be of assistance to the authors.Detailed feedback by each area of the manuscript. Reviewers should comment on each area, even when well done. Providing a positive comment on an area of the manuscript that is well done can provide encouragement to an author who may have other significant revisions to make. Author guidelines for the appropriate manuscript structure for each section (eg, Evidence-Based Practice Briefs) of ANC can be found at http://edmgr.ovid.com/anc/accounts/ifauth.htm. A reviewer's detailed feedback should specify the content that needs to be clarified and suggestions for improvement.Evaluate the necessity and clarity of the tables and figures included and the need for tables not included.Evaluate the references for relevance and absence of important references. Make sure the references are newer (<5 years old) and provide the appropriate support for the manuscript content. Older seminal references are acceptable.Assess the abstract's accurate summary of the manuscript. As with writing a manuscript, reviewers should assess the abstract last. Make sure the abstract is structured according to the author guidelines.Provide your recommended disposition of the manuscript as either accept, minor revision, major revision, or reject. As with most journals, articles with minor revisions are typically accepted for publication. Because of ANC's commitment to the development of new authors, unlike many journals manuscripts, manuscripts requiring major revisions are also typically accepted for publication as long as the authors make the recommended changes. This will take some perseverance on the part of the authors; manuscripts with major revisions may need to go through the review process multiple times before the manuscript is accepted for publication. Perseverance can pay off if the authors listen and amend their work on the basis of reviewer and editor comments. Do not shy away from this contribution to your profession. Every neonatal nurse has something to contribute in the review process, and you will learn about the process and writing for publication by providing reviews. Remember you can go back to the Editorial Manager Web site and look at the other reviews to see how yours compares. You will also receive follow-up letters that let you know about the progress of the manuscripts that you review. We award CEUs to those who provide quality reviews. This is a great way to earn CEUs, provide professional feedback, and learn something along the way. Finally, we would like to remind all new and experienced reviewers of the ethical responsibility of reviewers. It is inappropriate for a reviewer to share the contents of a manuscript under review without the permission of one of the coeditors. If you are interesting in becoming a reviewer for ANC, let us know. You can find our e-mail addresses at the end of this editorial. We are exploring ways to provide a “new reviewer orientation” session for those individuals wanting to learn how to be a more effective reviewer. As part of this process, one of the journal editors will provide you with feedback about how to improve specific reviews. We would also like to encourage you to go to the Web site for the journal Nursing Research for examples of good manuscript reviews. For several years, Nursing Research has provided examples of peer reviews and the authors' response to those reviews. Each of these examples provides evidence that a good peer review can significantly improve even the most experienced author's work (see http://journals.lww.com/nursingresearchonline/Pages/openmanuscriptreview.aspx). Finally, we want to thank all of our current reviewers for their service to the journal. Conducting peer review is rewarding when the published manuscript is of high quality and contributes to neonatal nursing. For new and continuing reviewers, we would also like to remind you that free continuing education credits are offered for quality reviews. For authors, we want to clarify that manuscripts are sent out for peer review unless we make a decision to reject without review. The primary reason a coeditor may reject a manuscript without review is our assessment that the work is not appropriate for our journal readership. In this situation, we will provide authors with suggestions for other journals that may be more appropriate. A manuscript may also be rejected if it includes significant content without appropriate citation of previous work.

    "abstract": "Increasingly, evidence supports enteral probiotics are an important risk-reduction strategy for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) among very low birth-weight and extremely low birth-weight preterm infants. Yet, the majority of providers remain reluctant to implement practice changes.The aim of this study was to better understand the discrepancy between the available evidence and clinical practice regarding the use of probiotics and other NEC prevention strategies in New Jersey.Using an exploratory descriptive design, a multimodal interprofessional survey was developed and executed to elicit intensive care nursery provider knowledge, views, and current practice.Although the sample size was small (N = 29), approximately one-half of respondents familiar with the literature rated the quality of the evidence regarding probiotics as \"above average\" to \"excellent.\" These respondents were \"very likely\" to \"extremely likely\" to recommend probiotics as an NEC prevention strategy; however, none actually prescribed this intervention. The most important reason respondents did not prescribe probiotics was the focus on providing exclusive maternal and donor breast milk feedings. Other confounding factors included provision of oral colostrum care, standardized feeding protocols, and withholding feedings during blood transfusion.Study results suggested that some providers (primarily nurses) were not familiar with probiotic literature, which may contribute to deficits in knowledge translation to practice.Areas for future study include identifying improved mechanisms for knowledge dissemination, recognizing and addressing barriers and facilitators to knowledge translation, and understanding how probiotics fit and/or contrast with other NEC risk-reduction strategies in the research and clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "We are very excited to have the opportunity to serve the National Association of Neonatal Nurses (NANN) as coeditors of Advances in Neonatal Care (ANC). Our vision for ANC is to further its reach as the premier journal for neonatal clinical practice and research. We plan to operationalize this vision by working together with each of you to make ANC the leader in publishing scholarly debate around clinical practices, research methods, and research findings related to the care of newborns and their families with a focus on high-risk situations. We believe that with our combined leadership and your support, ANC can be the foremost forum to which all neonatal scholars turn to first to find diverse and innovative approaches that will shape their own practice and research. Thus we plan to: Identify and solicit thought-provoking and controversial papers that entice a greater readership and relevance to practice; Choose manuscripts that meet the criteria for clinical and scientific excellence and relevance for the neonatal nursing community; and Increase the number of submissions and thus the excellence of our journal through mentorship of new and returning authors. Over the next several issues, we plan to use our editorial space to provide mentorship to authors. We know that exciting things are happening in your neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), but does anyone outside of your unit know about it? Your team has designed and tested an evidence-based bundle to provide care to very low birth weight infants and you want to share it with others—but do not know how? Your professional practice model provides opportunities for you to change care practices using the best evidence—now what? We know you have expertise in a clinical area to share with others. We plan to outline sequentially the steps you need to take to develop your work into a scholarly manuscript for publication. These editorials will be for those neonatal nurses who have an idea brewing and are curious about the writing process and for those who have been trying to get that last draft completed and submitted for publication. Few people really love scholarly writing, and even fewer of those people are bedside nurses in the clinical setting, but it is essential we share our knowledge and expertise. We want to motivate you by providing the steps for getting started, what to do when the going gets tough and how to keep going even when the end seems far away. Each editorial will provide tips and strategies for helping you with this process. Several of the editorials we plan to share with you are outlined below. Part 1: Steps to beginning the writing process. Find a topic: Why passion is important; Considering projects or activities in your NICU; Choose a journal: Why Advances in Neonatal Care? Write down everything you know about the topic; Keep a notepad nearby, Do a journal search, work with a librarian, What is the evidence supporting your topic? Decide what kind of manuscript you will write. Part 2: Steps to reviewing manuscripts. Why all good writers learn from reviewing others' work; Review the journal manuscript guidelines; Appraising the title and abstract; Reviewing the body of the manuscript; How best to make comments to the authors; Can the tables and figures stand alone?; Don't forget to examine the references. Part 3: Searching the literature and using reference management software. How to search, Working with a librarian, Endnotes, Reference manager, and Refworks. Part 4: Writing the abstract. What belongs in the abstract, Using section titles, The abstract brings your reader to the work, Consider word or character limits. Part 5: Authorship—working alone or with multiple authors. Writing can be a lonely job, Divide and conquer: division of labor, Manuscript contracts, and Who should be an author: authorship ethics. Part 6: Write a review article. Choosing a topic, Using a format to answer your question, Describing your review methodology, Writing the results, Identifying how your discussion is different from the results, and Making recommendations for practice and future research. Part 7: Writing a research article. Stating the problem, Purpose of the study, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusions Recommendations for practice, Recommendations for future research. Part 8: Using pictures and creating visually appealing tables and graphs. Why pictures and figures, When to use tables and graphs, Presenting your findings visually, Advantages and disadvantages of tables, Advantages and disadvantages of graphs, and When and how to add digital media. Part 9: The review process. Manuscripts are seldom accepted on the first submission, Preparing for the resubmission process, Letter to editor drafting your revisions, Revise and resubmit may take multiple submissions, What if the manuscript is totally rejected—now what? Beginning anew. Part 10: Ways to keep writing. Start with an outline and begin filling in the space—no one likes blank pages, Write something everyday, Set-up a writing place: needs can be individual, Don't get discouraged. Through these editorials, we will provide guidance for beginning the writing process, searching the literature and using referencing software. We will also share outlines for manuscript design including creating tables and graphs that can make your work visually appealing and enhance its readability. Lastly, we will help you to maneuver the review process. We know that if you keep going, you will see your name in print. Through-out the next year, we welcome your comments and hope you will communicate openly with us about what you see in these editorials and your expectations for the journal. We are looking forward to this opportunity to work with each of you. Please consider submitting your scholarly work to ANC; we are committed to supporting both new and seasoned authors.

    "title": "Infant Mortality Rates and Preterm Birth",

    "abstract": "Infant mortality rates are typically described as the number of deaths under 1 year of age per 1000 live births in a particular geographical area. Worldwide, infant mortality is reported by country or state and generally reflects the overall health of the population in the geographical area represented. Mortality and morbidity rates across countries and states have traditionally compared “developed” versus “developing countries.” Developed countries are typically industrialized nations with per capita incomes above $12,000, with an average per capita income of $38,000, while developing countries will have many citizens with per capita incomes $12,000 or less. As a nation, the United States takes pride in having the best healthcare in the world, yet our rate of 6.1 infant deaths per 1000 live births continues to lag behind the rest of the developed world. Countries such as the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungry each have lower infant mortality rates (2.7, 5.0, and 5.3 per 1000 live births, respectively).1 Worldwide, over 1 million infants die from prematurity and the complications of preterm birth annually,2 and while the rate of US preterm births (<37 weeks) has decreased in recent years to 9.57% in 2014, preliminary data on 2015 preterm rates have inched up to 9.62%.3You might be asking, so why are all these global statistics important to me? In collaboration with the March of Dimes and other groups, the World Health Organization (WHO) published “Born Too Soon. The global Action Report On Preterm Birth” to increase policy efforts globally to reduce preterm births.2 Specifically, the March of Dimes seeks to bring the US prematurity rate in line with the other very high human development index countries.4 The human development index (HDI) was established by the United Nations to further describe countries beyond economic growth. The HDI is a summary index of a country's human capacity on 3 dimensions: (1) a long and healthy life, (2) being knowledgeable, and (3) having a decent standard of living. Using these dimensions, countries are ranked from “very high” to “low” levels of human development. The United States ranks 8th of 49 countries with a very high human development index, yet our infant mortality rate is much higher than many countries that are ranked 9th through 49th. The aforementioned data highlight the unbalanced nature of how the healthcare dollars in the United States are distributed. Deaths of infants in the acute care setting are not unfamiliar to most neonatal providers, but given the US infant mortality comes in large part from preterm births,1 how we can impact infant mortality rates? The WHO posits that deaths from preterm birth should be addressed by reducing preterm births and providing appropriate feasible healthcare to all preterm infants at birth, with appropriate management of labor and delivery centered between these 2 major areas. The March of Dimes has set a goal to reduce the US premature birth rate to 5.5% by 2030, with a goal of bringing the United States in line with other very high human development index countries. As neonatal healthcare providers, we should be asking ourselves why does the United States continue to lag behind developed countries that spend less on healthcare and with far less health human capacity and how can we help the March of Dimes achieve this admiral goal? While some of the difference in our rates may be explained by our counting of 23 and 24-week births as live births and other countries may consider these infants to be a product of miscarriage,4 it does not explain all the differences. Based on 2005 data, a preterm infant born at less than 28 weeks' gestation had annual healthcare costs that exceeded $200,000 each year through the first 7 years of life,5 but the resources to support infant healthcare continue to be threatened by how we as a country spend our healthcare dollars. While we will never eliminate all preterm births, if we are to achieve the targeted March of Dimes goal of 5.5% by 2030, we all must engage in policy and advocacy work. Our infants cannot advocate for themselves. Join the NANN advocacy committee or other advocacy groups that support infant health. In addition, reflect on how you can advocate specifically for: Increasing resources for preterm infant interventions in proportion to the burden of healthcare expenditures, especially in the first year of life when deaths from the complications of preterm birth are highest. Similarly, increasing resources for research around preterm infant care needs to receive proportional attention to advance neonatal science. Ensuring evidence-based interventions for preterm infants are accessible to all. These interventions should include affordable access for all preterm infants to early neonatal tertiary care, postdischarge primary and specialty care, and early intervention services. The families caring for these infants. The burden of caring for a preterm infant goes beyond the economic impact and must also include providing resources to support the family in managing the psychological effects of having a preterm infant who may have lifelong special needs. Given our chosen profession and passions, we are stewards for at-risk and preterm infants and as such this stewardship must go beyond care at the bedside. We owe this to the infants and family in our care. Please consider our plea to action. Debra Brandon, PhD, RN, CCNS, FAAN Coeditor; Advances in Neonatal Care [email protected] Jacqueline M.

    "abstract": "HAPPY NEONATAL NURSES DAY In September, NANN celebrated Neonatal Nurses Day with all of our members. The NANN national office is grateful for the care you provide to vulnerable infants and their families. This year's theme was Healing Hands. Generous Hearts, which highlighted the passion of neonatal nurses and the lifelong impact of your care. You continue to go above and beyond to ensure that each one of your patients receive excellent care. We know that the work takes talent and is not easy. To be a neonatal nurse means you are special. Your healing hands provide nurture and provide the warmth that comes from your generous heart! Thank you, from all of us here at the national office. ZIKA VIRUS UPDATE In August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated the interim clinical guidelines for healthcare providers screening patients for Zika virus. Did you know that Zika virus is more than just microcephaly? It can cause intracranial calcifications, hydrocephalus ex vacuo, hydranencephaly, pachygyria, lissencephaly, agyria, brain atrophy and brain asymmetry, enlargement of posterior fossa, ventriculomegaly, restricted middle cerebral artery flow, and abnormally formed or absent structures (including corpus callosum, thalami, cerebellar vermis, and brain stem). In addition, infant outcomes include eye abnormalities, hearing impairment and hearing loss, limb abnormalities (including arthrogryposis, clubfoot, and congenital hip dysplasia), seizures, swallowing impairment, severe irritability, developmental delay, and growth abnormalities. Infants with congenital Zika syndrome ultimately will require lifelong care. This will place an enormous amount of stress on our healthcare system for years to come. The CDC is working to test mothers and infants who are at risk. A real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction should be performed on an at-risk infant's serum and urine, and IgM antibody testing should be performed on infant's serum. The CDC US Zika Pregnancy Registry is updated regularly with data that have been collected. This registry was created to gain information about the virus and to collaborate with state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments. Using these data, ongoing recommendations for clinical care, services for pregnant women and families affected by Zika virus infection, and prevention techniques during pregnancy will be provided for healthcare providers and the general public. For more information about the clinical guidelines for Zika virus infection, please visit the CDC Web site at https://emergency.cdc.gov/coca/calls/2016/callinfo_082316.asp. In addition, NANN continues to post information on the latest Zika virus information at www.nann.org.",

    "abstract": "EXTREME BABY MONITORING It was only a matter of time. When wearable sensing devices hit the market for adults, infants and children could not be too far behind. The old baby monitors that allowed parents to listen for their baby's crying seem downright ancient as the internet of things offers the potential to continuously track the baby's vital signs and behavior. The latest wave of devices permits overanxious parents to monitor their baby's body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, motion, sleep position, or oxygen level. The real-time data are transmitted to the parent's smartphone using a mobile app, and abnormal conditions prompt an alert on the smartphone. This way, parents can monitor changes in their babies whether they are in the next room, across town, or across the country. These devices come in a variety of forms. A small flexible arm patch or a bluetooth-enabled “smart pacifier” can measure the infant's temperature and alert the parents if the infant develops a fever. An ankle band tracks heart rate, skin temperature, movement, and body position. A “smart sock” worn on the foot monitors heart rate and oxygen level. Other sensors attach to onesies worn by the infant or are incorporated into a button that snaps onto an item of clothing. Wireless charging for some of these biosensing devices is even possible. All of this begs the question: what are we trying to achieve with wearable sensors for infants? Most are marketed as safety devices, but what they keep infants safe from is unclear. Most parents' greatest nightmare is sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), yet these sensors do not protect against SIDS any more than traditional cardiorespiratory monitors do. Many parents find that monitoring their infants provides them peace of mind; they no longer have to stand over their baby's crib listening for breathing. While at work, they can monitor the status of a baby left in the care of a babysitter. The other side of the coin is the potential for this technology to provide a false sense of security.1 In the worst-case scenario, parents might neglect proven SIDS prevention principles (safe sleep environment, supine sleeping, avoidance of tobacco smoke, etc), relying on the device to prevent SIDS, even though the devices state that they cannot prevent SIDS. Moreover, sensors never tell the full story, and some of the data can be misleading. For example, during obstructive apnea, respiratory movement can continue although no air is being exchanged. If the sensor does not also measure oxygenation, parents might be falsely reassured that their baby is still breathing. If parents simply trust the data rather than checking on the baby, the outcomes could be disastrous. Many people have wondered whether these devices have real uses or are just expensive high-tech gimmicks for the “nerd” generation. Wearable sensors certainly are not cheap, ranging from $150 to $300 or more, depending on the type, how many functions are monitored, and the sophistication of the interface. The sensors provide more data, but not necessarily any more interpretation of what the data mean, how to rule out a false alarm, or how to intervene, when indicated. More data can just lead to more confusion if the information is not useful. It is likely that such technology will appeal strongly to parents of infants who have been in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), where they became accustomed to and even reliant on continuous physiologic monitoring. It is not unusual for parents to request home monitors even when they are not indicated. Wearable sensors could be seen by some parents as a substitute for conventional hospital monitoring, and a way to continue this at home. However, when an infant truly needs home monitoring, parents are thoroughly trained in observation and assessment, operation of the monitor, intervention, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.1 If parents verbalize their intention to purchase and use a wearable infant sensor after discharge, it is important for nurses to be aware of the limitations of these devices, and to educate parents about what they can and cannot do. Parents should be aware that these devices have not undergone the scrutiny for accuracy, safety, or effectiveness that is provided by the Food and Drug Administration approval process. Because they do not have audible alarms, wearable monitors are not marketed as medical devices, and the manufacturers are able to avoid such regulation. Rather than recommending these products, caregivers should continue to emphasize evidence-based interventions to ensure safe sleep and to prevent SIDS.1 This technology is not going to be a short-term fad; if anything, the market will be flooded with even more wearable sensor options as parents demonstrate their willingness to spend a few hundred dollars for “reassurance.” The devices are already so popular that there are waiting lists to purchase them. 1. King D. Marketing wearable home baby monitors: real peace of mind? BMJ. 2014:349:. THE WAGE GAP: MEN IN NURSING STILL PAID MORE THAN WOMEN Fifty years after the Equal Pay Act, the male–female salary gap has narrowed in many occupations, but not among registered nurses.1 A recent study found that male nurses are paid an average of $5148 more annually than female colleagues in similar positions. The study used self-reported salary data provided by six National Sample Surveys of Registered Nurses and American Community Surveys across the United States. Salary information was analyzed from a total sample of more than 290,000 registered nurses (9% men) who were working full-time. The investigators considered the impact of demographic factors, work hours, experience, work setting, clinical specialty, job position, survey year, and state of residence on annual salaries. For the 25-year period from 1988 to 2013, average male salaries were higher than female salaries every year, and the salary gap between men and women did not close. The salary difference varied somewhat according to clinical specialty area and position. In hospitals, men were paid an average of $3873 more than women, whereas in ambulatory care, men earned $7678 more. Male nurses earned more than female nurses across specialties ($3792 more in chronic care and $6034 more in cardiology) and positions ($3956 more for middle management and $17,290 more for nurse anesthetists). This study is unique in demonstrating that the male–female salary gap in nursing has persisted over time. The study does not elucidate the reasons for pay inequity in a female-dominated profession. The investigators comment that the salary differences found in this study are similar to those that exist in the medical profession. They speculate that the reasons could be related to women taking time off during their careers for child-bearing. Women might be less skilled negotiators than men and are less likely to be promoted. Whatever the reasons, employers are encouraged to examine their wage structures for the male and female nurses in their facility, and attempt to eliminate this disparity. 1.

THREE NEW BOOKS NEONATAL NURSES CAN RECOMMEND TO PARENTS Anita Catlin, DNSc, FNP, FAAN As neonatal nurses develop relationships with parents, they offer resources to make the NICU journey easier. Two of the books described are bedtime stories for same-sex parents to read to their children. One is a guide for parents at the time that a child is dying. All three books are filled with heartfelt thoughts. Dr Stacey Bromberg and Dr Joe Taravella are counselors who work with couples of like gender and their children. They looked for a happy book that normalized the “two mommies” or “two daddies” experience. Upon finding none, they wrote their own. Hugs of Three: My Mommies and Me (ISBN 978-0-9881902-1-4) $9.99 www.ForwardFootsteps.com Hugs of Three: My Daddies and Me (ISBN 978-0-9881902-0-7) $9.99 www.ForwardFootsteps.com These 2 hard cardboard colorful books will bring joy to the readers. They are bedtime stories for the infants of 2 moms or 2 dads. They are filled with Jessica Warrick's lovely illustrations of a family of blended ethnicity at home with their new baby. The baby is made to feel very special and very loved. By having these books in the nursery or recommending them for parents, neonatal nurses can support the family who may feel a bit outside of the circle of care. Loving Your Baby...A Gentle and Practical Guide to Parenting Through Miscarriage, Stillbirth and Infant Death by Shari Morash (ISBN 978-0-9939237) Loving Your Baby... is a new book that NICU nurses can both use themselves and recommend to families. Shari Morash and her family had no guide when her son, Josiah, died shortly after birth. She was determined that other mothers would not feel as lost and alone as she did. She states, “I have written the book I wish had been given to me.” This small paperback is filled with practical advice, resources, Web sites, and support group information in Canada and the United States. The chapters follow the timeline of “finding out,” “the miscarriage or death of the infant,” “planning goodbyes,” and the “journey of grief.” The references and bibliography list many fine works to read. This book should be in every NICU library and Morash's work is a genuine addition to the bereavement literature.",

Underrepresented minority nurse practitioners offer valuable perspectives in the care of underrepresented minority patients. However, there remains a current racial and ethnic discordance between neonatal providers and patients. Efforts to eliminate health disparities must begin before nursing school. The current racial and ethnic composition of neonatal nurse practitioner faculty in comparison to students in the United States is unknown.The purpose of this study was to determine the racial and ethnic composition of neonatal nurse practitioner faculty and students in the United States and contrast this data with available data for the racial and ethnic composition of the neonatal intensive care unit patient population.This cross-sectional study used a nonexperimental survey to describe the racial and ethnic composition of neonatal nurse practitioner faculty and students in the United States.There was no significant difference in the racial and ethnic composition between neonatal nurse practitioner faculty and students. There were significant differences for all race distributions between neonatal nurse practitioner students and neonatal intensive care unit admissions.The discordance between neonatal nurse practitioner students and neonates in the neonatal intensive care unit is important in addressing disparities and begins before nursing school. Identification of barriers and strategies for recruitment and retention of underrepresented minority nursing students and faculty is needed.https://journals.lww.com/advancesinneonatalcare/pages/video.aspx?v=62.",

MSSA infection may present as pustulosis or cellulitis and evolve into bacteremia, pneumonia, endocarditis, brain abscesses, and osteomyelitis. There is a paucity of literature regarding the treatment and long-term outcomes in the premature infant.A 32-week twin developed MSSA sepsis with presentation of pain, decreased movement of upper extremities, and global hypotonia. Blood cultures remained positive despite antibiotic coverage.The infant was admitted to the level IV NICU with the diagnosis of MSSA bacteremia, with concern for dissemination and osteomyelitis.Diagnostic studies included laboratory testing for sepsis evaluation, radiologic studies to evaluate for dissemination, immunologic testing to rule out complement deficiency, and hematology testing to rule out hypercoagulable conditions.Diagnostic testing showed extensive cellulitis, osteomyelitis, multiple liver abscesses, and epidural abscesses suggestive of spinal epidural abscess (SEA). Abscess debridement and irrigation on the left distal femur, left elbow, and right tibia were performed. The infant completed 8 weeks of IV antibiotic therapy. Immunologic and hematology testing was within normal limits.Prompt recognition and follow-up for clinical signs of sepsis are vital when caring for premature infants. Inclusion of pediatric subspecialist recommendations to assure all diagnostic studies and treatments are completed can significantly impact the patient's outcome. Long-term follow-up is needed for premature infants with the diagnosis of SEA.",

    "abstract": "Background: Sleep-associated infant death is the leading cause of postneonatal mortality in the United States. Preterm infants are at higher risk for sleep-associated death, but maternal adherence to safe sleep practices is lower than for mothers of full-term infants. Data are lacking on whether maternal neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) visitation time impacts safe sleep compliance after hospital discharge. Purpose: For mothers of preterm infants, to investigate the association of time days per week spent in the NICU and adherence to safe sleep practices after discharge. Methods: A prospective observational study of 109 mothers with infants born at less than 32 weeks from 4 Colorado NICUs who completed a survey at 6 weeks after discharge about infant sleep practices. Maternal time spent in the NICU was defined as the average number of days spent in the NICU per week of infant hospitalization, as documented in the electronic medical record. Multivariable logistic regression models assessed the relationship between time in the NICU and safe sleep adherence. Covariates included maternal/infant characteristics significant at P &lt; .2 level in bivariate analysis. Results: Predictors of compliance with all safe infant sleep practices included public/no insurance compared with private insurance (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.29; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.09-0.96), some college/associate-level education versus bachelor's degree (AOR 5.88; 95% CI 1.21-28.67), and depression/anxiety symptoms (AOR 0.37; 95% CI 0.14-0.97). NICU visitation days was not associated with adherence to safe sleep practices. Implications for Practice and Research: Maternal visitation days was not associated with adherence to safe infant sleep practices after discharge, highlighting the need to identify barriers and facilitators to engaging families about SUID risk-reducing behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Background: Necrotizing pneumonia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus can lead to the formation of pneumatoceles in the lungs. Standard treatment guidelines are not available due to the rarity of pneumatoceles in neonates. Clinical Findings: Baby H. required prolonged respiratory support and supplemental oxygen to maintain appropriate oxygen saturation parameters for infants more than 34 weeks' gestation corrected. He was found to have multiple pneumatoceles in both lungs on different radiological modalities. Primary Diagnosis: Baby H. was a former 32.2-week gestation male infant diagnosed with pneumonia caused by necrotizing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus leading to pneumatocele formation in both lungs. Interventions: Baby H. was managed with aggressive antibiotic therapy and then was conservatively managed until he received a tracheostomy tube on day of life (DOL) 75 to prepare for discharge home. Outcomes: Baby H. was discharged from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) on DOL 113 with a tracheostomy tube for prolonged mechanical ventilatory support and a gastrostomy tube for nutrition. Numerous follow-up appointments with specialists have occurred since discharge. Practice Recommendations: While methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumatoceles are uncommon in the NICU setting, it is important for neonatal care providers to be aware of the causes and treatment choices currently available. Although conservative therapy is commonly utilized, it is important that nurses learn other available management strategies such as the ones highlighted in this article to best advocate for their patients.",

    "abstract": "Studies have shown that between 10% and 20% of workers report witnessing incivility and microaggressions daily, while 20% to 50% affirmed that they have been the direct target of such types of mistreatments in their workplace.1 What is incivility? What are microaggressions? Civility is formal politeness, kindness, good manners, courtesy in speech or behavior, and being respectful even if you do not like the person very much. Civility includes treating others with dignity, respect, and consideration.2 It is the way most of us would like to be treated. On the other hand, incivility is low-intensity deviant behavior with the ambiguous intent to harm the target, in violation of workplace norms for mutual respect.1,3,4 Having work assigned unjustly, disrespect, rude behaviors, having judgments questioned, rationalizing aggression (they deserved it), social manipulation, insulting comments, aggressive behaviors, withholding information, sabotage, and failure to respect privacy are also examples of incivility.4 These mistreatments and rude behaviors have been observed between co-workers, staff and patients, staff and patients' families, students and faculty, faculty and students, all peoples across the gamete as well as across the globe, and unfortunately the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is not immune to this behavior. Microaggressions are comments or behaviors that insult an individual, whether intentional or unintentional. These behaviors and comments communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative attitudes or create environments that stigmatize culturally marginalized groups. Brief everyday exchanges that send denigrating messages, physical intimidation, and insults to certain individuals because of their group membership (gender, culture, and race) are all examples of microaggressions. The persons making the comments may be unaware of the impact of their words or actions. However, these behaviors have negative impact on the recipients.4,5 How many times have you or someone you know made jokes referring to a cultural stereotype or assumption related to race, economic status, gender, culture, religion or because they are different from you? Have you ever treated your patient differently because of something in their background (sexually transmitted disease, and substance use disorder), or because of where they were from or the way they looked, such as they were unkept, or had on the wrong clothes? Have you ever threated someone, been suspicious of or responded to a patient slower because of their race, culture, gender? How many times have you or a colleague made inappropriate comments regarding a patient's situation? If yes then you have engaged in microaggressions. Did you ever provided a suggestion or present an idea at work only to be told later not to discuss issues related to your work area with others or to keep your mouth shut? Have you ever been threatened that if the numbers/situation does not improve/resolve that “someone is going to lose their job and it won't be me”? Have you ever asked someone where they were from because they were different from you? How many times have you or someone you know made jokes referring to a cultural stereotype or assumption related to race, economic status, gender, culture, religion or because they are different from you? Have you ever held your purse or bag tighter because someone from a different culture/race walked near you? Have you ever told someone who was going through a challenging time to “man up”? Often these types of comments and behaviors seem to slip out and we may not even realize it. Many of us have been the targets these types of comments and behaviors. Incivility leads to stress and stress leads to incivility. The cycle of uncivil behaviors and stressors lead to negative health consequences and harm one's self-image, decrease self-esteem, self-confidence, self-efficacy, and well-being1 and lead to depression, anxiety, and trauma.6 Microaggressions and incivility have both been linked to headaches, hypertension, sleep difficulties, posttraumatic stress disorder, and burnout. A negative career impact has been documented in employees subjected to this this type of mistreatment including leaving the workplace or even the nursing profession.5–7 The effects of incivility and microaggressions are cumulative and the recipients of incivility and microaggressions often experience ambiguity, which may lead them to dismiss the event and blame themselves as being overly sensitive.4 A higher rate of stress, burnout, lower job performance, theft, and misuse of time and resources has been seen in those who have engaged in uncivil behaviors.5,6 Further impacts of incivility and microaggressions are a reduction in cognitive ability in the recipient, and an increase in diagnostic errors and procedural errors when rudeness was present in the clinical area has also been demonstrated.6 According to a study by Vargas et al,8 patients have reported witnessing hospital staff treating patients and their families with uncivilities and/or microaggressions. A few examples from this study are as follows: Talking to family members like they were children. Ordering patients/families around. Patients being given conflicting information from the nurse and doctor. Patients requesting that instructions be repeated and the staff stating I do not have time. Statements linked to a person's social identity, social position, or condition. Patients, feeling they were the victims of microaggressions and incivility, felt anxious dealing with staff, which may prevent a patient from asking for help or reporting a symptom; other studies showed recipients left hospital settings in the middle of treatment, never to return to healthcare again.9 It is important to remember that we are meeting families on what could be characterized as their worst day. Please consider: How do you act on your worse day? Are you more difficult or anxious on your worse day? We need to give families in the NICU grace it is their worst day. Stigmatizing them does not make their worst day better. Strategies to improve work environments are essential because the long-term consequences of incivility and microaggressions can lead to psychological and physical issues as well as increased patient care errors. What do we need to do? Do you feel equipped to speak up when someone has treated you with or you have witnessed incivility or microaggression? We each need to step up and educate ourselves and others regarding microaggressions and incivility. Counseling needs to be readily available and offered to those who have been the recipients of these behaviors and to the those that have displayed the behaviors.1 We need to create an atmosphere where incivility and microaggressions are discouraged—by creating inclusive, welcoming, and healthy workplaces, which combat microaggressions and incivility. Understand how microaggressions show up and how to respond productively.6 Be aware of your biases, self-reflect. Reflect on how your statements and actions may be impacting others. Be thoughtful about common phrases. Instead of “man up,” “rise to the occasion,” work to unlearn language and actions that are uncivil or microaggressive. Understand each other's lived experiences. Work to unlearn language and actions that are uncivil or microaggressive. We are a helping profession, and we need to support each other and our patients and their families. The common thread is to treat others as you would want to be treated. —Pamela Harris-Haman, DNP, APRN, NNP-BC Section Editor, Practice Improvements in Neonatal Care",

    "abstract": "Background: Pregnant persons with a primary genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection can transfer HSV to the fetus or infant through the placenta or birth canal, which can cause significant infant morbidity or mortality. Primary nongenital infections with HSV-1 or HSV-2 in pregnant persons and the risk of infant infection are not well documented, leaving the clinician to make non-evidence-based decisions on evaluation and treatment in such presentations. Clinical Findings: A term newborn was delivered vaginally by a pregnant person with a nongenital HSV-2 infection. The pregnant person's rash first appeared around 32 weeks' gestation, started on their lower back, and terminated on the outer left hip. The rash improved but was still present at time of delivery, and this rash was their first known HSV outbreak. Primary Diagnosis: Prenatal exposure to HSV-2. Interventions: Diagnostics included the pregnant person's rash surface culture, immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M for HSV-1 and -2; infant surface, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), and serum HSV-1 and HSV-2 polymerase chain reactions (PCRs), infant CSF studies, blood culture, liver function tests, and treatment with intravenous acyclovir. Outcomes: This infant remained clinically well during hospitalization and was discharged home at 5 days of life when CSF, surface, and serum PCRs resulted negative. Practice Recommendations: Risk for infant HSV infection versus parent/infant separation and exposure to invasive procedures and medications should be considered when pregnant persons present with primary versus recurrent nongenital HSV infections. Research is needed for the evaluation and treatment of infants born to pregnant persons with primary nongenital HSV infections in pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Background: Simulation-based training (SBT) and debriefing have increased in healthcare as a method to conduct interprofessional team training in a realistic environment. Purpose: This qualitative study aimed to describe the experiences of neonatal healthcare professionals when implementing a patient safety simulation and debriefing program in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Methods: Fourteen NICUs in California and Oregon participated in a 15-month quality improvement collaborative with the California Perinatal Quality Care Collaborative. Participating sites completed 3 months of preimplementation work, followed by 12 months of active implementation of the simulation and debriefing program. Focus group interviews were conducted with each site 2 times during the collaborative. Content analysis found emerging implementation themes. Results: There were 234 participants in the 2 focus group interviews. Six implementation themes emerged: (1) receptive context; (2) leadership support; (3) culture change; (4) simulation scenarios; (5) debriefing methodology; and (6) sustainability. Primary barriers and facilitators with implementation of SBT centered around having a receptive context at the unit level (eg, availability of resources and time) and multidisciplinary leadership support. Implications for Practice and Research: NICUs have varying environmental (context) factors and consideration of unit-level context factors and support from leadership are integral aspects of enhancing the successful implementation of a simulation and debriefing program for neonatal resuscitation. Additional research regarding implementation methods for overcoming barriers for both leaders and participants, as well as determining the optimal frequency of SBT for clinicians, is needed. A knowledge gap remains regarding improvements in patient outcomes with SBT.",

    "abstract": "Background: Neonatal encephalopathy is a clinical condition of altered neurological function in the first days of life. Targeted temperature management (TTM) is a validated approach to mitigate neurologic sequelae. Current literature suggests using rectal or esophageal site to assess temperature during TTM, but few studies focused on the best and the less invasive site to evaluate the temperature. This case report describes the performance of the bladder temperature monitoring during TTM. Clinical Findings: A female newborn was born at 39 weeks' gestational age plus 4 days. At delivery, the newborn was in cardiorespiratory arrest. Primary Diagnosis: After performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation and neurological examination, a hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy was diagnosed. Interventions: After about 2 hours from birth, the newborn underwent TTM. Outcomes: A total of 4642 measurements of rectal temperature and 4520 measurements of bladder temperature were collected. Agreement between the 2 sites was statistically significant with a mean difference of 0.064°C ± 0.219 (95% confidence interval, −0.364 to 0.494); F = 47.044; and P value of less than .001. Furthermore, difference between rectal and bladder sites was not influenced by patient's urine output ( F = 0.092, P = .762). Practice Recommendations: Bladder temperature seems to have a good reliability and not to be inferior to the other assessment site currently used. Using bladder catheter with temperature sensor could reduce the number of devices, ensure safer stabilization, and decrease treatment downtime.",

There is currently limited literature on the experiences of parents with infants diagnosed with biliary atresia. Purpose: To explore the psychological journey and coping styles of parents of infants with biliary atresia in a single center in Shanghai, China. Methods: A qualitative study design was used. Face-to-face and semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 parents of infants with biliary atresia. Colaizzi's method of data analysis was utilized, using NVivo 11.0 software. Results: The psychological journey and coping styles of parents could be divided into 4 stages. Different themes were extracted at different stages: before diagnosis, parents experienced complex emotions and actively sought treatment; at the diagnosis stage, negative emotions dominated and parents convinced themselves to accept reality; in the postoperative stage, positive emotions, accepting reality, active response, and the need to learn to take care of their infant gradually appeared; and at the discharge stage, parents accepted the coexistence of positive and negative emotions and the variety of needs that emerged. Implications for Practice: The findings of the study may help healthcare professionals identify and focus on the psychological needs of parents of infants with biliary atresia, leading them to implement effective coping strategies to increase the caregiving ability of parents. Implications for Research: Future research should explore the effects of supportive interventions for parents of infants with serious chronic illnesses.",

    "abstract": "Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) nurses and other care providers were early adopters of family-centered care in the hospital setting, well ahead of other pediatric and adult units. Over the past 30 years, NICU parents became essential members of the healthcare team, not “visitors” in the NICU. The COVID-19 pandemic challenged this philosophy and almost overnight parents of critically ill infants were no longer essential care providers and were once again relegated to “visitor” status.1 While there are various models of family-centered care, family-integrated care focuses on engagement of parents in the care of their infant during hospitalization as partners in care through their physical presence.2,3 Family-integrated care provides emotional support for parents as they navigate the unfamiliar environment. Units that use family-integrated care had improved infant weight gain, decreased parent stress and anxiety, and increased exclusive breastfeeding at discharge.4 During the pandemic, many units shifted from a focus on family-centered care to safety of infants, parents, and providers. For many families, the pandemic exacerbated the challenges they already faced to be physically present and participate in the care of their infant. Restrictive policies put in place for safety limited the number of parents who could visit and the time of day they could be physically present with their infant. Parents had to balance work and caring for other children while navigating the experience of caring for a hospitalized infant in the middle of a pandemic. For example, parents may have had limited resources for transportation to the hospital, especially with significant distances or the lack of public transportation. In addition, parents were often homeschooling older siblings that limited their available time to be present with their hospitalized infant. Families with greater financial stress and with mental health problems were often most impacted by the restrictions placed on families.5 NICU providers were also challenged on multiple fronts during the pandemic, including implementation of new and evolving restrictions on parental presence. Unit policies changed rapidly and frequently as the science evolved. Despite leadership teams' best efforts, these changes often led to unclear communication with families and subsequent frustrations for both families and providers.1 Parents' ability to be physically present with their child as much as they would desire has always had challenges in the NICU, which were exacerbated by COVID-19. In this issue, we have 3 articles that present parents' perspectives on what it was like to have an infant in the NICU during the pandemic. These articles highlight important lessons learned to best support parents today and beyond. Ms. Biskop and colleagues shared the experience of parents in Sweden who were separated from their infants because of testing positive for COVID-19.6 It is important to note that prepandemic, 62% of Sweden NICUs had facilities that supported a mother's physical presence 24/7 from birth until discharge home, which included a place for the mother to sleep either in a room with her infant or nearby.7 Please examine the important findings from this study. They underscore the importance of clear communication and ongoing support for parents when they must be separated from their infant. However, separation may occur in many contexts that need consideration by the healthcare team such as military deployment and parents impacted by the justice system. Ms. Yance and colleagues further describe the experiences of mothers in Ontario, Canada.8 Parental presence early in the pandemic was limited to one parent for a scheduled 3-hour period of time. Mothers reported that building trust with the healthcare team during those uncertain times was essential. Key elements to building trust included empathy and support from the team, consistency in the nurses caring for their infant, and clear and transparent communication. The findings of this study emphasize the important role of consistency in the delivery of care that is exemplified in primary nursing. The last article in this series by Dr Ritcher and colleagues describes the experiences of mothers from Vancouver, Canada.9 As with the other 2 articles, the consequences of separation from their infant due to COVID-19 polices were featured. Unlike the other 2 articles, mothers described some “positive” aspects of the restrictive policies around visitation. For example, it was easy to keep unwanted visitors at bay. Finally, like others,3,10the introduction of virtual platforms for telehealth, educational programing, and group support allowed for greater access and flexibility. Many of the recommendations from the 3 articles in this issue as well as other recent pandemic studies focused on the importance of interventions that facilitate the integration of families into the care of their infant and that support parental well-being. Institutional policies during the pandemic greatly impacted family-centered care. However, factors that impede parents' ability to be physically present and participate in their infant's care to the degree they desire existed prior to the pandemic and continue today such as the financial costs of taking work leave to be with and care for their infant. In addition, while most NICUs have policies that stated parents can be present 24/7, in actuality, parents are often asked to leave during rounds, procedures, or during a crisis in the unit. The pandemic brought much more scrutiny to the issue of supporting family presence and how that presence could be perceived by nurses at the bedside. There was much uncertainty around the COVID-19 virus, especially in neonates; however, uncertainty of outcomes is not new for neonatal healthcare providers. In contrast, the NICU is a place of uncertainty for all parents that necessitates parental support to minimize parental stress and maximize parental well-being. Parents are the lifelong caregivers of their child; we have them in the NICU for a short time, a formative time in their growing relationship. Care providers in the NICU need to consider how best to support the developing relationship between parents and their infant. Some general recommendations to support infants and the presence of their families include the following: Supportive hospital policies to facilitate parental presence and participation in infant care to the degree parents desire. Physical NICU environments that supports parental presence. Transparent communication and education that encourage parents as decision-makers for their infant. Parental support that supports their well-being through ongoing screening and access to emotional support (eg, peer support groups) or counseling (eg, psychological) as needed. Virtual or telehealth modalities to allow for greater flexibility and access. —Debra H. Brandon, PhD, RN, CNS, FAAN Co-Editor in Chief; Advances in Neonatal Care, [email protected] —Jacqueline M.

    "abstract": "Background: Stress from preterm infant admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is associated with infant and maternal physiologic changes, including endocrine and epigenetic alterations. Little is known about the mechanisms connecting NICU stress to biologic changes, and whether preterm infant and maternal stress are reciprocal. As a preliminary step, feasibility and acceptability of measuring indicators of stress are required. Purpose: This study evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of research examining perceptions and biologic markers of stress in premature infant–maternal dyads during and after NICU hospitalization. Methods: We evaluated study feasibility using a longitudinal descriptive design. Acceptability was measured via a maternal questionnaire. Exploratory data regarding hospitalization, perceptions of stress, social support and social determinants of health, and biologic markers of stress were collected during the first week of life and again 3 months after NICU. Results: Forty-eight mothers were eligible for the study, 36 mothers were approached, 20 mothers consented to participate, and 14 mothers completed data collection. Mothers reported high levels of study acceptability despite also voicing concern about the sharing of genetic data. Exploration of DNA methylation of SLC6A4 in preterm infants was significant for a strong correlation with perception of total chronic stress. Implications for Practice and Research: Clinical practice at the bedside in the NICU should include standardized screening for and early interventions to minimize stress. Complex research of stress is feasible and acceptable. Future research should focus on linking early life stress with epigenetic alterations and evaluation of the dyad for reciprocity.",

    "abstract": "Background: The mobile-enhanced family-integrated care (mFICare) model addresses inconsistencies in family-centered care (FCC) delivery, with an evidence-based bundle of staff training, parent participation in rounds, parent classes, parent peer mentors, expanded role for parents in infant caregiving, and a parent-designed app. Purpose: Our aim was to explore the views of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) nurses and physicians about mFICare implementation, including what worked well and what could be improved. Methods: As part of a larger study to compare mFICare with FCC, we invited registered nurses, nurse practitioners, and fellow and attending physicians at the 3 study sites to participate in a survey about mFICare implementation. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Results: The majority of the 182 respondents with experience delivering mFICare positively rated parent-led rounds, parent classes, parent skills acquisition, and the nurse–family relationship resulting from participation in mFICare. Respondents were less familiar or neutral regarding the parent peer mentor and app components of mFICare. Most respondents agreed that the mFICare program improved parent empowerment, and they shared suggestions for optimizing implementation. Physicians experienced more challenges with parent participation in rounds than nurses. Three themes emerged from the free-text data related to emotional support for parents, communication between staff and parents, and the unique experiences of families receiving mFICare. Implications for Practice and Research: The mFICare program was overall acceptable to nurses and physicians, and areas for improvement were identified. With implementation refinement, mFICare can become a sustainable model to enhance delivery of FCC in NICUs.",

    "abstract": "Background: There has been little research exploring paternal needs while experiencing a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) stay. Some tools exist to measure paternal needs, but do not incorporate items to capture important information about how fathers cope with stress differently, and may have different needs. Therefore, an instrument is needed to measure and prioritize what needs are important to fathers to help facilitate the development of nursing interventions to help fathers cope with the NICU environment. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to conduct a feasibility study before large-scale pilot testing the instrument, the NICU Paternal Needs Inventory (NPNI), so we could then determine what are the physical, emotional, and psychological needs of fathers. Methods: A nonexperimental, quantitative, and descriptive design was used to address the study's aims. Fathers were recruited from a level IV NICU and asked to complete an online survey (consisting of a demographic survey and the NPNI). Results: Needs rated 100% were knowing infant's progress, directions on caring for infant, flexible visitation, and assurance receiving the best care. The remainder showed a wide range of responses suggesting that needs of fathers are individual and varied. Implications for Practice and Research: Use of the NPNI to evaluate a father's unique and individual needs would allow for the nurse to develop father-specific, individualized interventions. Findings support that the NPNI is feasible to accomplish measuring fathers' needs, but a larger study is needed to test the reliability and validity of this tool.",

    "abstract": "Background: Despite well-established benefits of skin-to-skin care (SSC) for preterm infants and parents, standardized guidelines for implementation do not exist. Furthermore, the literature offers little evidence-based information to guide best practice. Purpose: To discover whether SSC using a body wrap to hold preterm infants would increase the duration of SSC, decrease parental stress during SSC, and minimize adverse events to ensure that body wraps are safe and feasible. Methods: Twenty-nine dyads of parents and preterm infants younger than 34 weeks postmenstrual age were enrolled. The first 15 dyads to meet inclusion criteria were assigned to a standard of care group for SSC with no body wrap. The remaining 14 dyads were assigned to an experimental group for SSC with a body wrap. Each dyad performed 2 SSC holds. Parents completed the Parental Stressor Scale and Parent Feedback Form. Adverse events were also documented. Results: No statistically significant differences were found between the 2 groups in total SSC time ( P = .33), the number of adverse events ( P = .31 for major events; P = .38 for minor events), average parental stress ( P = .22), and parental confidence performing SSC ( P = .18). Implications for Practice and Research: This study found that SSC with a body wrap is safe for preterm infants in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). This is the first study to explore the use, safety, and effectiveness of body wraps during SSC with preterm infants in an NICU. Future research should be conducted with larger sample sizes to further evaluate the safety and efficacy.",

    "abstract": "The use of a single dose of antenatal steroids to facilitate fetal lung maturation in the expectant management of threatened preterm birth has significantly improved the mortality and morbidity of premature infants worldwide. In some settings, the evidence for this practice has been extrapolated with self-reports of up to 6 repeated courses during the antepartum period. Concerns about the use of repeated antenatal courses prompted the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to publish a consensus statement (2000) that reaffirmed the safety and efficacy of a single course of antenatal steroids, but emphasized that there are no data to support the safety and efficacy of repeated courses. The statement cautions against the use of multiple courses outside of research protocols. Despite these recommendations, wide variations in clinical practice continue to exist. There are growing concerns about the potential deleterious effects of steroid exposure on the developing human brain. It is plausible, although not proven, that negative neuro-developmental impact may occur, or be compounded by multiple antenatal or combined antenatal and postnatal steroid exposures. This article provides a review of the evidence to support appropriate steroid use. The physiology and pharmacology of both endogenous and exogenous steroids are outlined to enhance the clinician's understanding of these potent agents. Recommendations for targeted clinical evaluation and short- and long-term follow-up of steroid exposed infants are provided. A clear understanding of the known and potential risks and benefits of single and multiple courses of antenatal steroids is essential to prompt a critical re-examination of the safety and efficacy of repeated steroid exposure in the neonate.",

In the first 2 days of life, the infant developed hepatosplenomegaly, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, thrombocytopenia, and hemolysis. After extensive diagnostic investigation, the case was solved on the infant's day of life (DOL) 12. In retrospect, the health care team had obtained a diagnostic result that could potentially have solved the case on DOL 2. Although this infant suffered no long-term sequelae secondary to the delayed diagnosis, the review of this case presentation may assist other clinicians in an early identification of a potentially lethal diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "The gel-filled pillow is a device used to provide a soft surface to support and cradle an infant's head. Little is known about the thermal conductive properties of this device when used in an open crib. This simulation study evaluated the use of the Squishon 2 gel pillow in an open crib to determine the potential cooling effects on a mannequin infant.This simulation study was conducted on a thermal mannequin.A descriptive comparative repeated-measures design was employed.A thermal mannequin with the head placed on the gel pillow was used. The energy required to keep the mannequin head at 37 degrees C in 4 conditions was measured. The 4 conditions were as follows: (1) lying in an open crib on a standard mattress (baseline), (2) lying on the gel pillow with the disposable cover from the manufacturer, (3) the head wearing a cap and lying on the gel pillow, and (4) the head without the hat lying on the gel pillow with an insulated cover over the pillow.Univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed significant differences in energy required to maintain the mannequin head at 37 degrees C among the 4 conditions (F3 = 283.23, P = .0001). The hat on head condition was found to decrease energy utilization by an average of 6.36 kcal/d when compared with the head on mattress condition (P = .0001). Extrapolation of energy to maintain mannequin head warmth into potential kilocalories utilized revealed that a potential increase in kilocalories needed to maintain thermoneutrality would be needed.The most effective way of conserving heat was in the hat on the mannequin head while lying on a gel pillow condition. The use of a gel pillow without a hat or an insulated barrier caused an increase in energy requirements and kilocalorie usage in this mannequin model.The results of this simulation study suggest that use of the gel pillow outside of a thermally controlled environment and in an open crib environment may increase energy use to maintain thermoneutrality. The Squishon 2 gel pillow conducts heat from the mannequin head and may increase kilocalories per day consumption in the preterm infant. Furthermore, the results of the study support previous findings that a hat helps conserve energy.",

    "abstract": "THERE IS A NEW “BUG” IN TOWN Katherine M. Newnam, PhD, RN, NNP-BC CPNP, IBCLE It is well understood that invasive candidiasis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the extremely low birth-weight infant.1 Fungal infections reportedly affect 4% to 7% of preterm infants with a birth weight under 1000 g. Mortality rates range from 20% to 38% (mean 30%), with significant neurodevelopmental morbidity reported in those surviving infants.1 Risk factors for candidiasis in the neonatal population include prematurity, low birth weight, antibiotic exposure, and the neonatal intensive care environment.2 Imagine the concern related to an emerging resistant strain of Candida. Japan issued the first report of Candida auris in 2009. This new species was identified through sequence analysis of the nuclear rRNA gene. Phylogenetically related to Candida haemulonii, 15 patients were later identified in South Korea with an approximately 40% mortality rate.3 The new strain spread to New Delhi, India, which described 12 inpatients from 2 different hospitals over a 2-year time frame (2009-2011). Four of the 12 patients were low birth-weight infants.3 This new clonal strain is multidrug resistant and appears genotypically distinct from other strains. As with most Candida strains, this fungus is opportunistic, with immunocompromised patients most at risk. With the rapid spread to numerous countries in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, and East Asia, the United States has identified 13 cases to date.4 Seven of these cases are from 4 states, New York, Illinois, Maryland, and New Jersey. Reportedly, these patients in the United States were immunocompromised with extended hospital stays. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports the possible spread of this organism within the healthcare setting.4 C auris is now described by the CDC as “a global health threat,” as this strain has proven resistance to all 3 major classes of antifungal drugs. Other Candida strains have proven resistance to some therapy, but this is the first truly multidrug-resistant yeast.5 Recommendations for healthcare professionals include implementation of strict contact precautions to control the spread of the organism. Obviously, strict hand hygiene to protect our vulnerable patients and ourselves is paramount.4 NANN DELEGATION TO CUBA Pamela Harris-Haman, DNP, CRNP, NNP-BC On March 13-18, 2017, a group of 13 individuals from across the United States represented the National Association of Neonatal Nurses (NANN) as delegates to Cuba. NANN was invited to visit the country by the Cuban Nursing Society. The opportunity to represent our organization and the United States as delegates to this beautiful country was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The group arrived in Havana on March 13 and was warmly greeted by the ATA representative Amircal Salermo. The US representative was Stacy Ramirez. We spent the first day touring Havana and the El Morro Castle. Tuesday began our meetings with representatives of various Cuban healthcare organizations. Our initial meeting was with the Cuban Nursing Society, where we discussed the role of nurses within the Cuban healthcare system. We were invited to visit the Ramon Gonzalez Coro Hospital. During this tour, we were able to talk with nurses about the role of nurses and typical newborn care. Following the discussion, we were able to tour the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The National School of Public Health invited us for a panel discussion on infant care and issues facing hindrances to breastfeeding. During this discussion, we were able to glimpse the passion the Cuban people have for each other and their patients. During the afternoon, we visited a policlinico (polyclinic) to see firsthand how the healthcare system in Cuba operates. The policlinico is the primary center of care serving patients with a variety of clinics from maternity to geriatric care. We then traveled to see the family doctor/nurse at the consultorio (consulting). Each individual in Cuba is assigned to a family doctor and a nurse who are responsible to oversee the healthcare needs of up to 1500 patients. Each family doctor/nurse unit is required see each patient in the office annually and performs a yearly home visit. On Friday, we were able to visit the Cuerpo de Guardia, Hospital Universitario Materno. Dr Cocoa, one of the neonatologists, spent time discussing the healthcare needs and treatment of infants in the NICU and the various levels of hospitals within the Cuban health system. She then proudly allowed us to visit her NICU and talk with parents and nurses. The delegation was treated to a tour of their state-of-the-art milk bank. Our last hospital tour was of a maternity hospital, “Hospital de obstetricia y ginecologia,” where mothers are admitted for complications including poor glucose control, premature labor, and other health issues. We were able to enjoy many wonderful restaurants and sights on our visit. The delegation was able to network with Cuban nursing professionals, which will hopefully lead to future collaborations. Most impressive was the compassion, much like our own, that the nurses felt for their patients. The nurses in Cuba face many challenges due to lack of resources. Yet, these professionals are fiercely passionate about nursing and the patients they care for.FIGURE 1FIGURE 2",

    "abstract": "Neonatal providers and nurses, in particular, have been strong advocates of individualized developmental care. Neonatal-focused journals such as Advances in Neonatal Care routinely publish literature about individualized developmental care. Research surrounding the content of interventions and how they are delivered and thus what constitutes developmentally appropriate care for an individual infant and his or her family continues to evolve. Since developmental care was first promoted by Dr Heidelise Als in the 1980s,1 a body of literature has emerged to support the observation of infant behavioral organization (infant cues) in response to the stress of the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) environment that is used to guide caregiving to minimize infant stress and optimize infant outcomes. Therefore, the context of infant caregiving centers around the infant. The overall goal of individualized developmental care is to promote the short- and long-term health and development of high-risk infants including interventions that promote the well-being of an infant's family.2 While most individuals agree that individualized developmental care is infant directed and caregivers should modify the environmental context to minimize infant stress, implementation of individualized developmental care is hindered by the lack of empirical evidence to guide the implementation of “specific substantive interventions.” The use of multiple interventions in most empirical studies has impeded our ability to understand what and when specific interventions (eg, music) should be implemented to promote the best infant outcomes. When single-intervention research is available, the generalizability of the findings is limited by small sample sizes and variability in the delivery and content of the intervention (eg, recorded vs live music).3,4 In contrast, when specific data exist to implement an intervention (eg, noise-reduction initiatives), other barriers exist around nursery design, technology, and cost. The American Academy of Pediatrics established maximum noise levels for NICUs in 1997,5 yet 20 years later nurseries struggle to maintain appropriate noise levels. Many medical, nursing, and iatrogenic caregiving events occur in the chaotic environment of the NICU simultaneously, yet they are not in sync with each other. It could even be said that these caregiving events are antagonistic to each other, increasing stress for the infant and potentially the family. While there is little disagreement about the importance of attending to infant cues in the delivery of care, there are times when caregiving is intrusive and cannot be delayed to minimize infant distress. (The central line catheter is needed for antibiotic delivery and repeated central line catheter placements are sometimes unavoidable.) Unfortunately, there also continues to be circumstances when we as providers use the “necessity to deliver care” as an excuse to overlook infant cues. (Three infants need to be fed at 9 am, and the nurse decides the unit's cue-based feeding protocol just will not work today.) To continue to advance the discovery of new knowledge about individualized developmental care best practices, future work should investigate strategies to eliminate or minimize the barriers to implementation. Developmental interventions continue to be at the top of the list for those interventions that are “missed” when staffing is poor or there is not enough time to spend with a family to support appropriate breastfeeding or discharge planning.6 Future intervention development should be designed to be practically implemented and of low cost. Research should also evaluate whether specific developmental interventions have short- and long-term benefits, when the intervention should be implemented (eg, age) to maximize outcomes, and the cost savings associated with the intervention. These types of studies may be difficult to fund but are essential to advance knowledge in developmental care research; maximizing short- and long-term outcomes of these infants must be our greatest concern. Getting infants to the doors of the NICU cannot be enough; we must think beyond the doors since much of what happens in the NICU has the potential to have lifelong effects.7 Sincerely, Debra Brandon, PhD, RN, CCNS, FAAN Coeditor; Advances in Neonatal Care [email protected] Jacqueline M.

    "abstract": "USING SOCIAL MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGY TO “CONNECT” WITH PARENTS IN THE NICU Katherine M. Newnam, PhD, RN, NNP-BC, CPNP, IBCLE Social Media; we are in the midst of a true generational movement. Facebook, Skype, Instagram, FaceTime, Twitter, texting, blogging, vlogs, and many other social contact platforms allow the parents of our tiny patients stay engaged and receive support and information from others. Families who have infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) use these and other social platforms on their devices daily. It is not surprising that during stressful times, parents reach for methods of communication that allow immediate access to information. Imagine the frustration of being away from your child without reliable means of contact. Research surrounding the NICU parent experience describes parental feelings of anger and fear.1 Often parents exhibit negative symptoms of stress, depression, anxiety, and even hopelessness following their infants' admission to the NICU.2 These psychological symptoms may create barriers to the process of parent–infant interactions, delay the parental role acquisition, and delay infant bonding.3 These symptoms have been associated with decreased cognitive and emotional development of the infant.4 In addition, maternal psychological functioning has been shown to increase length of stay,5 perform oral feeding behaviors, and difficulty understanding discharge instructions.6 Members of the NICU healthcare team can embrace technology as a means to communicate with parents. Increased understanding of the various platforms may be required to devise creative ways to offer this level of parental support. An exciting publication in the Journal of Pediatrics describes the use of videoconferencing during healthcare team rounds using FaceTime (Apple Inc, Cupertino, California) or Telemedicine technology.7 This allowed the parents who could not travel to the hospital the ability to engage with the healthcare team daily. Real-time participation, and questions to the healthcare team with responses offered, gives parents a sense of belonging, satisfaction, and decreased stress.7 Additional methods of decreasing parental stress include individualized support,3 communication strategies, and enhanced visitation.8 Thinking outside the box, we must consider alternative methods of visitation or communication with families, including virtual. A review article was published to highlight existing evidence of alternative methods used to support communication with NICU parents.9 These technologies were described as methods to “augment” communication with the healthcare team. They included videoconferencing, videophone, Skype, FaceTime, or webcams (AngelEye Camera Systems or NICVIEW, video streaming devices for NICU patients).9 Although most parents expressed positive feeling of seeing their infants, this was not universal. Parents who expressed positive impressions of seeing their infant described reduced stress and anxiety.10 Parents who expressed negative feelings stated that the experience increased sadness and guilt about not being with their infants. Universally, parents expressed the advantage of sharing real-time videos with grandparents or siblings who could not routinely visit.9 Through the integration of these communication strategies, we can enhance the parental connectedness with the infant and the unit. As we begin to embrace the technologies that exist, we now move toward reasonable methods of integration. One of the biggest future challenges as we embrace these alternative methods of parental contact is protecting our patients personal and health information. WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY MOVES INTO THE INCUBATOR Can you imagine an extremely low birth-weight infant resting within the incubator with physiological parameters monitored by wireless technology? A world where there would be no “spaghetti wires” when repositioned or when we move the infant to the parent's chest for kangaroo care. Well, as we speak, this technology is being worked on by bioengineers and researchers across the world. One of the first breakthroughs in this technology is a multichannel electroencephalographic (EEG) that is showing promise in the NICU patient. According to the consensus statement by the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society, long-term, conventional EEG monitoring is recommended for some high-risk neonates with the goal to predict and improve neurodevelopmental outcome. Specific clinical conditions that confer this classification of high risk include acute neonatal encephalopathy, pulmonary risk for acute brain injury, central nervous system (CNS) infection or trauma, suspected or confirmed inborn errors of metabolism, perinatal stroke, sinovenous thrombosis, high-grade intraventricular hemorrhage, and/or genetic syndrome involving the CNS.1 EEG procedures and timing are also discussed within this consensus statement. Conventional EEG is considered the gold standard for diagnosing seizure activity and/or monitoring cerebral electrical activity in the neonate.1 This test can be expensive, and the correct electrode placement/connection may be difficult to maintain on our tiny patients. Lack of experienced personnel that are necessary to set up testing during evening and/or night shifts may also create delays for the NICU patient. Amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) has been shown to be more practical in this setting, yet this method does not provide localized abnormalities and may deliver a high rate of artifact affecting the accuracy of results.2 This new device is called a microEEG and was developed by Bio-Signal Group. It is Food and Drug Administration approved for use in neonates.3 The wireless EEG device is connected by adaptor to a specialized electrode cap (ANT-Neuro). The EEG signals are digitized by the device and transmitted via Bluetooth technology to a laptop housed at the bedside. A prospective, observational study was conducted to assess feasibility and problem areas during the use of a compact wireless device to obtain multichannel EEG recordings in the NICU.4 The study enrolled 28 infants between 2013 and 2014, and the subjects underwent 61 EEG recordings.4 Notable findings were 6 (10%) of the EEG recordings were uninterpretable secondary to artifact, 1 could not be downloaded, and the remaining 54 (89%) were acceptable for interpretation by the pediatric neurophysiologist. The bottom line is this ultra-compact wireless microEEG has the potential to provide long-term multichannel EEG recording to NICU patients. It is uniquely portable, reportedly easy to set up, and has clear application to the NICU setting. Correlation between existing wired continuous EEGs and/or video EEG testing would be valuable.",

    "abstract": "Whether you are a seasoned political aficionado or a legislative novice, it is likely that you have considered the implications of the new presidential administration's priorities on our neonatal patients and their families and how top cabinet officers and key executive agencies will implement policy visions with respect to nursing education and practice. Notably, a new presidency will bring resolution to the vacant Supreme Court seat. With more than 60 freshmen members of Congress on their way to Capitol Hill following the 2017 inauguration, we also anticipate considerable adjustments for the 115th Congress. National Association of Neonatal Nurses (NANN) remains committed to advocating for optimal care and health outcomes for neonates and their families. NANN will continue to impact nursing practice regulation and policy by fostering member engagement and collaboration with other healthcare-related groups to shape legislative and regulatory issues at the federal and state levels. Here are some relevant policy and advocacy topics to watch in the coming months. APRN SCOPE OF PRACTICE The call for utilizing advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) to the full extent of their knowledge and competence is coming from many places. In 2015, bills were introduced in the House and Senate to allow full practice authority for APRN's in veterans' administration facilities. On December 14, 2016, the Department of Veterans Affairs published a landmark rule granting veterans and their families direct access to care by nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, and clinical nurse specialists who work in the Veterans Health Administration. This ruling is expected to be an impetus for states to further remove barriers to scope of practice for APRNs. The American Academy of Nurse Practitioners provides an up-to-date interactive map of practice environment details, including licensure and regulatory requirements, for all 50 states at www.aanp.org/legislation-regulation/state-legislation/state-practice-environment. ACA, MEDICAID, AND THE STATE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM In March 2010, President Obama signed comprehensive healthcare reform, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), into law. The ACA refers to 2 separate pieces of legislation—the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act—that together expand Medicaid. Medicaid provides coverage for health and other related services for the nation's most economically disadvantaged populations, including low-income children and their families. The ACA also makes numerous improvements to the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). CHIP has been widely credited with helping to reduce the number of uninsured children in the United States from 10 million in 1997, when the program was enacted, to 3.3 million by 2015. Without congressional action, states will not receive any new federal funds for CHIP beyond September 30, 2017. The Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission (MACPAC) is a nonpartisan legislative branch agency that provides policy and data analysis and makes recommendations to Congress. In March, MACPAC will be reporting to Congress on Medicaid and CHIP, and presenting a core recommendation to extend federal funding for CHIP through fiscal year 2022. Congressional support of this recommendation will ensure the stability and continuity of health insurance coverage for more than 8 million low- and moderate-income children. For more information, visit www.macpac.gov. WOMEN'S MARCH On January 21, over 5 million people worldwide, and over 1 million in Washington, District of Columbia, participated in the Women's March on Washington. This woman-led civic activism brought together people of all genders, ages, races, cultures, political affiliations, and backgrounds with particular interest in celebrating diverse communities and protecting women's rights. The movement evolved out of concern that the 115th Congress and White House could undesirably affect women's rights, thereby significantly impacting the well-being of infants, children, and families. Among the issues that this group is following are the impact of a new Supreme Court justice on a woman's right to abortion, funding for Planned Parenthood, which provides education and health services primarily to women, and contraception coverage provisions under the ACA. RESEARCH AND PROGRAM FUNDING The National Institutes for Health continues to recognize the need for high-quality, evidence-based palliative care as a critical component of maintaining quality of life at any stage of illness. Federal and other funding is expected to continue to prioritize examination of palliative care issues such as relieving symptoms and suffering, understanding decision making by patients, families, and providers, and development of effective models for pediatric palliative care. It is also expected that the United States Department of Health and Human Services, as well as other funders, will continue to expand programs to study opioid abuse and pain management practice, including programs to study neonatal abstinence syndrome. In particular, there will be significant funding to support development of neonatal abstinence syndrome surveillance and reporting systems, as well as to support research that seeks to establish best practices for identifying and treating these vulnerable patients.",

However, evidence for the optimal formulation(s) to maximize growth while reducing the risks of glucose and electrolyte abnormalities is limited. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare the rates of hypernatremia and hyperglycemia with 2 weight-based standardized PN formulations versus one standard PN in low birth-weight preterm neonates. Methods: This was a single-center observational study of infants less than 1800 g birth weight and less than 37 weeks' gestation who received standardized PN in the first 48 hours of life. Patients in the weight-based PN group were compared with a historical group of patients receiving single standard PN. Rates of hypernatremia and hyperglycemia were compared by χ 2 analysis. Results: There was a nonsignificant ( P = .147) reduction in hypernatremia in the weight-based PN group (9 of 87; 10.3%) compared with the single PN group (16 of 89; 18.0%). However, hyperglycemia was significantly more frequent in the weight-based group than in the single PN group (24.1% vs 12.4%, P = .035). Implications for Practice: The 2 weight-based PN standardized formulations studied did not significantly decrease the incidence of hypernatremia or hyperglycemia. Implications for Research: Future studies to determine optimal standardized PN to provide early nutrition in high-risk neonates are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Around the world, neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) had to adjust many of their routine practices due to coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) while trying to continue to provide excellent care for newborns and their families. Prior to COVID-19, most NICUs used family-centered care as the framework to engage parents in infant caregiving.1 However, due to the need for urgent implementation of COVID-19 crisis management procedures in early 2020, family-centered policies regarding parental presence in the NICU were quickly modified to restrict parents' presence at the bedside. New policies varied from unit to unit and even changed over time, as we learned more about how the virus spreads. Yet, as 2020 turned into 2021, many of the restrictive parent presence policies have been slow to return to prepandemic standards despite an increased understanding of the virus spread, implementing safety protocols for healthcare workers that could have been adapted for parents, and knowing that parents as caregivers are essential to excellent neonatal care. Infants develop best when they are emotionally and physically attached to their parents. Parent presence and participation in care results in improved outcomes for both newborns and parents. Randomized controlled trials that employed family-centered care interventions resulted in increased newborn weight gain, decreased readmissions, and decreased parental anxiety, depression, and stress.2 During the pandemic, some of the reported restricted parental presence policies included: allowing only one parent to visit at a time; decreased mothers' presence to 2 hours per day; and, limiting fathers' presence to 1 hour per week.3 In one cross sectional survey of 277 NICUs, parental presence 24 hours per day 7 days per week decreased from 83% to 53%.4 These strict restrictions have led to parents requesting to be allowed back into NICUs.3,5 For example, after an informal survey of parents revealed concerns about family restrictions during the pandemic, the Vermont Oxford Family Faculty spoke out and stated that parents should be allowed back in the NICU to participate in care.5 Jennifer Canvasser, a former NICU parent who lost her son to necrotizing enterocolitis in 2012 and founder and director of The NEC Society, wrote about the importance of parental presence in the NICU to ensure shared decision-making at the bedside.3 Both the Vermont Oxford Family Faculty and Canvasser asked that partnerships with parents to be recognized during these complicated times. As NICUs grappled with these decisions, NICUs could have looked to use guidance from experts, such as the Institute for Patient and Family-Centered Care (IPFCC), to help make sure that parents were included in decisions at both the bedside and at the hospital level through the use of the IPFCC's pandemic planning resources.6,7 As in most pandemic work environments, extended use of technology is already in place in the NICU and new online platforms played a major role in connecting with families due to limited parental presence.8 Technology may have been an appropriate early solution to parent engagement as units learned about the pandemic, yet it was never meant to replace in-person visits.9 Seeing their newborn during physical separation may have been helpful to parents; however, it was insufficient.5 Parental presence as an active caregiver fosters infants' security and parent–infant attachment.10 As neonatal nurses we must continue to advocate for parents to be fully involved in their newborn's care and ensure that parents feel supported throughout the NICU stay. That is why NANN has joined with the National Perinatal Association and the Association of Women's Health Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses Association in the Consensus Statement on Family Presence in Neonatal Intensive Care Units.11 During the pandemic, the parent/caregiver role has not been seen as “essential” and parental presence in the NICU was not as hardwired into our culture as many would have liked to believe. We must now fully embrace parents as “essential caregivers” to the care of their infants in the NICU and avoid slipping back into the habit of labeling parents as visitors. Parents need supported in their need to be able to routinely participate in their newborn's NICU care. We need to advocate for the holistic care of newborns, parents, and families to support our family-centered decisions at the unit, local, and national levels. Parents are essential; they must become the “constant” and not the “visitor.” It is now time for all neonatal clinicians to partner with parents so that infants and families can fully benefit from family-centered care. —Jodi Herron Behr, PhD, APRN, RNC-NIC, ACCNS-P Assistant Professor, Texas Woman's University —Debra Brandon, PhD, RN, CCNS, FAAN Co-Editor; Advances in Neonatal Care [email protected] —Jacqueline M.

The current standard of care includes laser ablation therapy when needed. While intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) injections have emerged as a new therapy for ROP, so have concerns about the systemic effects of the bevacizumab (Avastin), specifically on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Purpose: To review the current literature on the impact of IVB on neurodevelopmental outcomes in neonates with ROP to inform nurses' knowledge and practice. Methods: A literature search was performed in the PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase databases. Eleven primary studies examining neurodevelopmental outcomes related to IVB were identified and reviewed. Results: Limitations of current studies, including small sample sizes, retrospective analysis subject to selection bias, and confounding factors such as sedation/anesthesia exposure, prevent robust conclusions from being drawn. However, there is not currently any clear evidence of negative neurodevelopmental impacts associated with IVB despite a sound theoretical basis for concern. Implications for Practice: Nurses should include all known and potential risks and benefits when counseling families and developing individualized plans of care for their neonatal patients with ROP. Implications for Research: Well-designed, prospective studies examining neurodevelopmental outcomes at later time points are needed to conclusively support or disprove results of IVB therapy for ROP in the context of potential adverse effects.",

Purpose: The current study aimed to explore the association between vigor at work (as an energy resource) and STS, while considering their association with the professional role (nurses/physicians—as a condition resource) as well as with coping flexibility (as a personal resource). Methods: In this cross-sectional study physicians and nurses working in NICUs across Israel completed a questionnaire comprising sections on demographics and professional characteristics, self-rated health, STS, coping flexibility, and vigor. Results: Of 280 physicians and nurses approached, 70% (195) completed the questionnaire. No significant differences between nurses and physicians were found in STS adjusted for gender, being in a committed relationship, and seniority in the NICU. Vigor was negatively correlated with STS—both in the entire sample and for each professional role alone. Coping flexibility was a statistically significant moderator between vigor and STS, whereas the interaction between vigor and professional role was not significant. Specifically, the negative relationship between vigor and STS was significant when coping flexibility was more than 10.10 (61% of the participants) but not significant at lower values. Implications for Practice and Research: The understanding of the relationship between vigor and STS, with coping flexibility as its moderator, encourages an intervention aimed at reducing stress by increasing these resources.",

    "abstract": "In the last week I have spent many hours rocking my 20-month-old son as he struggled to breathe while fighting the stridor, cough, and exhaustion of croup. The sweetness of a sleeping little person on my lap assuaged my fatigue as I rocked him. My mind wandered to the list—papers still to write, grants to revise, emails to return, and student projects to review. In the quiet, I thought deeply about the events of the past week: my daughter's high school graduation, university commencement and the graduation of dear PhD students, and attending the international necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) symposium. In the stillness I remembered an encounter with a family at the 3rd international NEC symposium whose son died from NEC last year. Cash Owen was born at 28.5 weeks weighing 2 lb 12 oz to Shannan and Cassius Finegan. After medical NEC at 2 weeks of age, he recovered and was nearly ready to go home when he became quickly and tragically ill with irreparable NEC at 67 days of age. Urgent surgery wasn't enough to treat his severe, widespread intestinal necrosis and concomitant sepsis. The days before he got sick, the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) team had told his parents that he had “one foot out of the NICU.” Despite concerns the day before he was diagnosed, Cash's clinical presentation went unrecognized as concerning for NEC. In Shannan's own words, she says that “Cash spent 68 days courageously fighting for us and even though his fight might be over, my fight as his mother will continue.” This special series related to NEC is dedicated to Cash and to his parents, Cassius and Shannan. They represent the reason for fighting for a world without NEC. Necrotizing enterocolitis is a devastating intestinal infection that primarily afflicts very low birth-weight (VLBW, ie <1500 g) infants. Alarmingly, of the nearly 9000 infants that are diagnosed with NEC each year, one-third will die. An infant's chance of developing NEC is directly related to the NICU in which they reside,1,2 which contributes 3-fold higher magnitude of risk compared to gestational age.3 For survivors—particularly of the severest forms of NEC—nearly half will endure long-term complications such as short gut syndrome, months to years of dependence on parenteral nutrition, lengthy hospitalization, multisystem organ failure, and frequent bloodstream infections. Infants treated surgically that survive are also known to suffer from delayed neurodevelopment. This special series on NEC is directed to our NICU nursing audience of Advances in Neonatal Care for 2 primary reasons: 1) to recognize the power of nurses to affect the environments and family context in which NEC develops and 2) to mobilize nursing's moral and professional imperative to reduce racial and ethnic healthcare disparities. Our first urgent call is to NICU nurses to engage in building a world without NEC. Nurses possess the wisdom to recognize that environments of practice affect their ability to provide quality care, and research shows that the clinical contexts of NICU caregiving structurally vary widely.4–7 Underresourced NICUs are more likely to have less supportive nursing professional practice environments, constrained nurse staffing, fewer lactation consultants, less donor human milk available, and lower use of nursing intensive interventions, such as supporting mothers in initiation and sustainment of breastfeeding.8–10 Human milk (HM) provides benefits to fragile infants that exceed the need for nutrition and control inflammation, a primary challenge in ill newborns that is critical to reducing NEC, as well as many other complications of prematurity.11,12 Hallowell and colleagues9 connected poor nursing work environments to lower exposures to HM, which is critically and structurally important because promoting HM feeding is a nursing-intense intervention and mother's milk is the only intervention known to boost a premature infant's immune capacity and reduce systemic inflammation. For each milliliter of maternal HM provided in the first 14 days of life, $534 is estimated to be saved from reduced morbidities.13 The dedication to quality improvement (QI) in an NICU may affect change in HM feeding practices, but while organizations have emerged to facilitate QI, participation in these learning communities comes at a high cost and institutions, which are already strapped financially, may be unwilling or unable to participate. We've noticed marked differences in accessing QI learning communities among underresourced units, particularly in the Southwest and Southeast, which may contribute to regional differences in NICU quality.14 The second urgent call to address NEC in our NICU communities comes from the intolerable disparities seen in the way Black and Hispanic families especially are affected by NEC.15–17 On adjusted analyses, Black and Hispanic infants experienced NEC more often and were 30% to 35% more likely to die.15 Even among infants with medical NEC, who typically survive, Black or Hispanic infants are 50% more likely to die than their White counterparts. Reasons for higher mortality from medical NEC may reflect delayed treatment but isn't clear from the research and more investigation is needed. Gaps in care related to low provision of HM to infants at risk for NEC is even more pronounced for Black infants. Lake and colleagues18 showed that disparities in exposure to HM were particularly prevalent between NICUs serving predominantly White versus predominantly Black families, potentially reflecting differences in NICU care contexts. In the United States, VLBW infants born to Black mothers are significantly less likely to receive any HM compared to non-Black infants.19 In a study of 1034 extremely low birth-weight infants cared for in 19 US NICUs, 64% of Black infants received HM compared to 84% of non-Black infants.20 Similar disparities in the rates of HM feedings between Black and non-Black populations have been reported elsewhere.21,22 Clearly, addressing NEC prevention and effective treatment is a significant part of reducing these unacceptable disparities that have such potential to do grave harm to Black and Hispanic infants and their families. We present this laundry list of statistics to highlight the need for equity in NICU care contexts. We are often told that we need these statistics to highlight the significance of NEC as a problem in our neonatal community, but for us, the story of one more baby, one more family, whose lives are forever changed by this disease is significant enough to keep fighting. The next step in our fight for a world without NEC is to present this special series in Advances in Neonatal Care. Our goal is to shift knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about NEC by presenting cutting-edge science and clinical improvement stories to birth a new vision of what can be done—today—to fight the good fight on behalf of fragile infants and their families. Our goal is to ultimately help to answer the question of what neonatal clinicians, especially nurses and nurse practitioners, need to know about NEC to provide better care to every infant, every time and everywhere. All high-risk infants who traverse the environment of the NICU deserve this best evidence-based care available. Over the next 2 issues of Advances in Neonatal Care, authors address topics from prevention and pathogenesis to interventions, diagnostics, and QI. Cohen and colleagues23 demonstrate that making donor HM available across 14 NICUs in New Jersey decreased NEC incidence by half. Andrews and Coe24 describe the multifactorial pathogenesis of NEC and features of the clinical presentation to watch out for as one cares for infants at risk. Killion25 examines the evidence base for feeding practices that withhold feeding around transfusions, concluding that higher quality research with larger samples is needed. This has been a topic of controversy for over a decade, and nursing research could dramatically support improvements in this area. To highlight innovations in diagnostics, Chan and colleagues demonstrate the use of abdominal ultrasound to inform NEC diagnosis, offering many helpful images to detect NEC. Upcoming articles will also examine the effect of intense QI to reduce NEC, showing successes are reliant on adapting processes and structures to sustain prevention efforts (eg, prioritizing HM feeding, adopting standardized feeding protocols, stewarding antibiotics, avoiding antacids, and in some cases, adopting donor-HM-derived fortifiers). Despite a great deal of activity in the scientific community in recent years to expose NEC pathogenesis, clinical research is especially needed to ask relevant questions and implement interventions to foster NICU care equity to reduce NEC disparities. Nurses have keen insights on what it takes to implement meaningful changes and study their impact in the fight to end NEC disparities. We call the neonatal community together to take up the fight to build a world without NEC—to do so we must address disparities and do it now. We do this work to support you in your fight. Sheila M.

    "abstract": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and postnatal growth restriction are significant clinical dilemmas that contribute to short- and long-term morbidities for the most premature infants.After a rise in NEC rates in a regional neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), improvement practices were implemented by an interdisciplinary quality improvement (QI) work group whose focus was initially on nutrition and growth. QI work was refocused to address both NEC and growth concurrently.Through various QI initiatives and with evolving understanding of NEC and nutrition, the work group identified and implemented multiple practices changes over 2-decade time span. A standardized tool was used to review each case of NEC and outcomes were continually tracked to guide QI initiatives.Focused QI work contributed to a significant reduction in NEC rates from 16.2% in 2007 to 0% in 2018 for inborn infants. Exclusive human milk diet was a critical part of the success. Postnatal growth outcomes initially declined after initial NEC improvement work. Improvement work that focused jointly on NEC and nutrition resulted in improved growth outcomes without impacting NEC.Use of historical perspective along with evolving scientific understanding can guide local improvement initiatives. Work must continue to optimize lactation during NICU hospitalization. More research is needed to determine impact of care practices on gastrointestinal inflammation including medication osmolality, probiotics, and noninvasive respiratory support.",

    "abstract": "Background: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains a major complication in the neonatal population. Standard practices regarding the care of premature infants and attitudes toward NEC prevention strategies vary across neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Evidence-based best practice dissemination was presented through the NEC-Zero bundle. To close gaps between evidence and practice, a telehealth-delivered intervention (ie, NeoECHO) was provided to NICUs. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to enable adoption of best practice for NEC prevention using NeoECHO through describing the local volunteer unit leaders', or internal facilitators' (IFs'), experiences in participating in NeoECHO and identifying the extent to which the facilitation activities within the NeoECHO experience were consistent with constructs from the integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (iPARHIS) framework. Methods: The design of this study was qualitative descriptive. Six IFs were recruited in the Southwest. After 6 NeoECHO sessions, individual interviews were conducted and transcribed verbatim. Content analysis was applied. Codes were informed by the iPARIHS framework. Results: Major themes were (1) Innovation: Quality Improvement Projects, Bundles of Care, and Huddle; (2) Recipient: Reluctant Stakeholders and Technical Modalities; (3) Context: Buy-In, Timing, Resources, Leadership, and Blame; (4) Facilitation: Betterment, Buddy System, Passionate Care, and Empowerment; and (5) Adoption: Continuous Quality Improvement, Evidence-Based Practice, and Honest Discussions. Implications for Practice and Research: NeoECHO fostered a learning community to share current practices, policies, and strategies for NEC prevention, but the IFs were essential to foster local participation.

    "abstract": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 2020, the National Association of Neonatal Nurses (NANN) published a new position statement, titled \"Racial Disparity in the NICU,\" which reviews the statistics concerning racially related health disparities for premature infants and includes 9 recommendations for how to endorse healthcare equality for all infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) regardless of race, parental economic or education status, or geographic area. Despite medical advances in the field of neonatology, prematurity remains a problem in the United States. In 2019, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report documented that one of every 10 infants in the United States was born prematurely, with statistics continuing to demonstrate disparate racial and ethnic differences in preterm birth. In 2019, the rate of preterm birth among African American women (14.4%) was about 50% higher than the rate of preterm birth among White or Hispanic women (9.3% and 10%, respectively).1 Preterm birth is identified as a leading cause of infant mortality, defined as death before 1 year of age. The majority of infant deaths occur within the neonatal period, the first 28 days. A CDC report on infant mortality2 showed that infants of African American mothers had the highest mortality rate (10.75), followed by Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (9.39), and non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaskan Native (8.15). This compares with lower rates for Hispanic (4.86), non-Hispanic White (4.63), and non-Hispanic Asian (3.63) infants. The differences in maternal–infant risk factors, especially the rates of prematurity, are the most important driver of racial/ethnic disparities in neonatal and infant outcomes.3 Along with racial disparities in preterm birth rates and infant mortality, several studies have shown that racial inequities in outcomes exist between hospitals as well as within NICUs. Horbar et al4 conducted a large cohort study including 743 NICUs in the Vermont Oxford Network, with 117,982 Black, Hispanic, Asian, and White infants born at 401 to 1500 g or 22 to 29 weeks' gestation from January 2014 to December 2016. Black, Hispanic, and Asian infants were segregated across geographic regions and NICUs, reflecting the racial segregation of minority populations in the United States. This study demonstrated large differences between regions and NICU quality of care, with Black very low birth-weight infants receiving care in NICUs with lower outcome quality measures than White infants. Disparities in neonatal outcomes have also been shown to be evident among other racial/ethnic groups of color. These disparities are long-standing and complex, with a multifactorial basis. Neonatal nurses are advocates for our patients and their families. We must explore personal or implicit bias, provide and seek education on cultural diversity, and address systems and policies that have given rise to racial and ethnic health inequities. In our neonatal units, we can commit to quality improvement by examining individual NICU statistics to evaluate significant trends in gestational age, race, and patient outcomes. As the professional voice of neonatal nurses, NANN endorses healthcare equality for all infants regardless of race, ethnicity, parental economic or educational status, or geographic area.

    "abstract": "Background: Extreme preterm infants face lengthy hospitalizations and are often subjected to painful stimuli. These stimuli may be related to routine caregiving that may negatively impact long-term developmental outcomes. Frequently obtained cuff blood pressure (BP) measurements are an example of a potentially noxious stimulus to preterm infants that may have a cumulating impact on development. Purpose: The primary aim was to explore the frequency of cuff BP measurements obtained in hemodynamically stable extreme preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Our secondary aim was to reduce the number of cuff BP measurements obtained in hemodynamically stable extreme preterm infants in the NICU. Methods: Quality improvement methodologies per the Institute for Healthcare Improvement were used combined with a multidisciplinary approach. Participants were infants born less than 27 weeks of gestation and discharged home. The baseline period was 2015 through Q2-2018 and the intervention period was Q3-2018 through Q1-2020. The electronic medical record was used to collect data and Minitab Statistical Software was used for data analysis. Findings/Results: A baseline of 5.0% of eligible patients received the desired number of cuff BP measurements and increased to 63.2% after the intervention period. Implications for Practice: Findings demonstrate that using quality improvement methodology can improve clinical care. Findings suggest the feasibility and safety of reducing the number of cuff BP measurements obtained on hemodynamically stable infants in the NICU. Implications for Research: Future endeavors should aim to reduce the quantity of painful stimuli in the NICU. Long-term developmental outcomes should be correlated in these patients.",

    "abstract": "Background: Infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) are at an increased risk for diaper dermatitis, which can cause skin breakdown and lead to significant pain and potential infection exposure. Skin care protocols in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) setting seldom specifically address the needs of this at-risk population, leading to inconsistent skin care management. Purpose: The goal was to support a decrease in the rate of diaper dermatitis for infants with NAS by designing and implementing an evidence-based skin care protocol. Methods: A retrospective medical record review was used to examine outcomes of 25 infants preintervention and 8 infants postintervention. The skin care protocol was a bundle of 5 evidence-based interventions: (1) a specific diaper dermatitis assessment tool; (2) frequent diaper changes with superabsorbent diapers; (3) application of petroleum jelly and alcohol-free wipes; (4) infant bathing in pH neutral soap; and (5) application of zinc oxide barrier cream for erythema. Results: There was an overall 80.5% decrease in diaper dermatitis from pre- to postimplementation ( P ≤ .01) as noted when comparing positive cases of diaper dermatitis with negative cases from pre- to postintervention. Implications for Practice: Expanding the skin care protocol to all neonates in the NICU and nursery could aid in maintaining skin integrity and decreasing diaper dermatitis in the NICU. More research is needed following this study for the data to be generalizable to other NICUs. This study offers key takeaways including using a specific diaper dermatitis assessment tool and consistently using the bundle of interventions.

    "abstract": "Stool tests for occult blood or reducing substances were introduced in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) as potential aids in the early recognition of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in high-risk neonates, and have been recommended by some as routine nursing procedures. Neither the performance characteristics of these tests with respect to NEC, nor their indirect impact, were evaluated formally before widespread adoption into clinical care. The published evidence suggests that these tests are not useful as diagnostic or screening tools. There is no evidence that routine stool screening for occult blood or reducing substances predicts NEC or decreases the rate or severity of this disease. The direct costs of the tests are significant. A greater concern is their potential unintended consequences, which include the cost of secondary tests, restricted nutritional intake, and the accumulation of distracting, useless data. The logistics of maintaining quality control, the demands on nursing time, and the cost of testing are increasingly important considerations. This installment of Focus on the Physical diverges from a step-by-step systematic physical assessment by addressing the utility of testing neonatal stools for occult blood and reducing substances as aids in the early diagnosis or prevention of NEC. Using the information from these tests requires a framework for understanding their rationale, the test performance characteristics in the NICU setting, and the potential benefits, costs, and risks of their routine use.",

    "abstract": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) has widespread implications for neonates. While mostly affecting preterm neonates, full-term neonates, especially those with congenital heart disease, are also at risk. Although the exact pathogenesis of NEC remains elusive, three major factors, a pathogenic organism, enteral feedings, and bowel compromise, coalesce in at-risk neonates to produce bowel injury. Initiation of the inflammatory cascade likely serves as a common pathway for the disorder. Clinical signs and symptoms range from mild feeding intolerance with abdominal distension to catastrophic disease with bowel perforation, peritonitis, and cardiovascular collapse. Vigilant assessment of at-risk neonates is crucial. When conservative medical management fails to halt injury, surgical intervention is often needed. Strategies to decrease the incidence and ultimately prevent NEC loom on the horizon, such as exclusive use of human breastmilk for enteral feedings and administration of probiotics.",

Most cases of NAIT arise when platelets of the father (and the fetus) express the human platelet antigen (HPA)1a and the mother's platelets expresses HPA-1b. A female patient presented with congenital severe thrombocytopenia and received 4 platelet transfusions, on days 2, 7, 16, and 28. This appeared to be a case of NAIT; however, extensive serologic evaluation by 2 reference laboratories failed to reveal the offending platelet antigen. Consistent with NAIT, the condition resolved by 6 weeks of age. By patient day of life 42, the platelet count had increased without additional need for transfusions, and by 16 weeks, the patient had a completely normal platelet count of 437,000/μL. The patient's platelet count remains normal at a 2-year follow-up. This case is reported as an instructive atypical case of NAIT, in which the relevant platelet antigen could not be identified.",

    "abstract": "Medication safety is vital to quality health care for all patients, including neonates. Medication use in neonatal intensive care is routine, but it is not without risk. The neonate is especially vulnerable to adverse effects related to medication. Although preventable errors can occur at any step of the medication process, the most error-prone stages are prescribing and administrating. New, wireless computer-based technologies have reduced medication errors in adult settings, but their readiness for the neonatal intensive care unit is still uncertain. The capabilities of 2 emerging technology applications (ie, computerized physician order entry and bar code-enabled point-of-care technology) are explored for their potential application in the neonatal setting. The opportunity for neonatal caregivers to influence the design of medication error-reducing technologies for use in the neonatal intensive care unit is explored.",

    "abstract": "Dear NANN Colleagues, A well-designed pilot study is an important contribution to the literature. Unlike some journals, Advances in Neonatal Care publishes pilot studies. As such increasing understanding about what constitutes a well-designed pilot study is important to both authors (researchers) and our readership. Thus, this editorial provides an overview of the components of well-designed pilot research. The specific purpose of a pilot study is to provide data to inform future work. Therefore, a pilot study is typically designed to pilot one or more of the following: an idea, innovation, or concept, or more precisely to test the safety, feasibility, acceptability, or efficacy of study designs or methods.1–4 Simply put, pilot studies are about examining new concepts or novel ideas. This could possibly be a study testing a new intervention, or new piece of equipment or a strategy that has worked in one population that is now being tested in another population (first tested with late preterm infants and now being tested with extremely early born infants). In the laboratory, pilot studies are often referred to as “proof of concept” and are considered a routine aspect of laboratory science. In the laboratory, the researchers may do the experiment with a very small sample just to see what happens; they conduct the experiment based on an educated “hunch” about what relationships might exist.5,6 Sometimes effects are discovered accidently during these experiments. As you might guess, in the clinical setting experiments based on educated hunches might not be justified or ethical, given the potential risks to our patients and families. It is important to note that these investigations are not just studies executed with small samples because the available convenience sample was small. By definition, pilot studies have small samples on purpose, such that once the concept is found to be safe or feasible, the plan is to continue to do further testing of the novel concept in larger samples.3–5 For (nurse) scientists, pilot studies constitute the first steps in developing an idea. These preliminary steps (pilot studies) are an important aspect of a planned research trajectory and are meant (designed intentionally) to build knowledge in a particular area of science.7 Thus, the discussion of future research (next steps) is an important aspect of the pilot study report.6 In particular, the discussion needs to emphasize the limitations of the current study, particularly what can and cannot be generalized from the results as well as the next studies that need to occur.6 Pilot studies are generally underpowered (sample not large enough to reach an appropriate level of significance). And thus, because of the use of a small sample size, the results are less significant and can only be used to generate beliefs that they will provide a trend toward significance guiding in the development of larger studies. Even if there are positive findings, the researchers cannot recommend the intervention or idea being tested for integration into practice. What might be said is “this is a promising concept” that with further research could be integrated into practice in the future. In other words, “stay tuned for further details.” Pilot studies are often the preliminary studies (small samples) used to build the science to support the need for further testing of an intervention in full-scale randomized control trial.1,8 One caveat that needs to be considered is that “if” the concept under study is of low risk to the population of interest than possibly cautionary recommendations for practice can be implied but this is not typical in neonatal research since our population is generally considered a high-risk population. We are not trying to diminish the importance of pilot studies with these cautionary statements. Evidence-based practice guidelines place pilot studies, even when well-designed, at one of the lowest levels of evidence. As such further scrutiny of the results is required, and the level of risk must be considered if integration of findings into practice is done without further research testing the concept. Yet, pilot studies are important to neonatal care for several reasons.9 Research involving neonates and their families is considered high risk and as such the pretesting of novel concepts with smaller samples is quite appropriate since we want to guard against risk until a concept, idea, or bundle (group of interventions) is ready for full-scale testing.9 Furthermore, choosing the sample size is important even in pilot studies and must be done thoughtfully with intention. The sample needs be large enough to provide direction for refinement of the intervention in next studies (for example, establishing effect size) and yet, small enough to not expose unnecessarily at-risk populations to greater risks.9,10 In the clinical setting, there are basically 4 types of pilot studies: (1) safety (is it safe; no change in infant stability and does not increase other risks); (2) feasibility (will it work); (3) acceptability (will clinicians, participants, and families find the intervention reasonable); and (4) efficacy (does implementation make a difference).8 In the literature the definitions of these different types of pilot studies are overlapping. Not all types of pilot studies are appropriate for testing all concepts or designs; however, safety, feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy studies do build upon each other and do build the science that is often necessary when the risks are high or the population of interest is already considered high risk, as is the case when conducting research with neonates.7 To increase understanding please find next an example of each type of pilot study. SAFETY EXAMPLE A new intervention is proposed for preterm infants with feeding problems, but the feeding intervention is first tested with well newborns who would have greater tolerance for the intervention and would be thus at less risk for adverse effects. Once tested (and refined as needed given infant behaviors and physiology stability) with the more stable population, the inclusion/exclusion criteria could be altered in the next study design to the true population of interest (preterm infants). Designing studies in sequence in this way allows researchers to test and refine the intervention while controlling for extraneous variables and yet also decrease risk for the study participants.11 FEASIBILITY EXAMPLE An instrument to measure infant behaviors related to drug exposure was initially tested in full-term infants. Now the researchers want to see whether the same instrument could be used with preterm infants who have also been drug exposed. Feasibility studies examine study designs, methods, instruments, or data collection methods for effects on the results. Are the data collected appropriate or not to achieve the intended results, given the strategies that were employed in the study design?11,12 ACCEPTABILITY EXAMPLE An intervention is proposed to increase family engagement, and during this trial the focus would be on whether families find out whether families believe the timing and their involvement works for them or not. Issues that might be addressed are whether the measures used are burdensome to families to complete (too long to complete or difficult to understand). Can they get to the neonatal intensive care unit at the time the intervention is planned or not? As you can see, the focus is not particularly on the outcome of the intervention but more on the process for how the intervention is delivered to families.11,12 It is important to note that sometimes feasibility and acceptability data can be collected concurrently in the same pilot study; however, this can sometimes be cumbersome and burdensome to participants and may not provide clarity about next steps that are important to why the researcher is testing the intervention in a pilot trial.13 EFFICACY EXAMPLE In a small trial (no randomization), a new intervention for supporting an infant during a retinopathy examination is tested to see whether the intervention is efficacious—makes a difference in short- and long-term behavioral and physiologic outcomes for the infant. The sample is small, and the plan is with refinement of the intervention strategy (as needed) from this pilot study to test in a full-scale trial with a larger sample.14,15 What is not a pilot study is any research with a small sample size. Within Advances in Neonatal Care, we publish studies with small samples. However, when considering the overall significance of any study (implications for practice and future research), there is always the concern that a study with a small sample will not generate statistically or clinically significant results. Consequently, researchers might, after the fact, call their studies with small samples, pilot studies to justify sample size, study design and/or methods and to make the results appear more publishable.16,17 During the manuscript review process, we might ask authors to retitle their manuscripts when the research presented is not truly a pilot study. Even if the results are meaningful, generalizing results from studies with small samples can only be done with extreme caution. In addition, making unwarranted claims about potential generalizability of the results from studies with small samples can be misleading to readers that may have limited knowledge of research design and methods. These studies with small samples are often the result of recruiting from a population of convenience (one location) with limited time to conduct the work (ie, study must be completed in 6-12 months) and possibly the result of not enough funding to complete the work.5,7 Given this weakness (the chance that results presented could be misleading), some journals will not publish pilot studies. However, studies with small samples may provide direction (positive or negative outcomes) and guidance about effect sizes that can be useful for future research. In conclusion, pilot studies are important to building neonatal science. However, pilot studies must be executed with intent and reported clearly. Study aims must be specific to study purpose (safety, feasibility, acceptability, and/or efficacy) and appropriate for the level of evidence that exists about the topic or concept.9,10 The presentation of pilot studies needs to be succinct and direct, so readers are able to interpret results appropriately. This means authors need to provide clear information about what is known and what is not known about a phenomenon and what research designs, methodologies, and protocol processes are being tested so that readers do not draw inappropriate conclusions.14,15 Reports need to include information about how the results should or should not be used in the clinical setting and about what the next steps in the research trajectory need to be. Clearly delineating these items in the research report is important to building the science, as well as protecting our patients and families. Given the novelty of neonatal science, we believe in publishing pilot studies, they are important to growing neonatal science yet at the same time we need to clearly state the facts and findings, so all who read and consider using the results for further research or to guide practice understand the true level of the evidence.

    "abstract": "Background: There are many challenges to providing care to infants in need of ventilator therapy. Yet, few studies describe the practical handling of the ventilator circuit during nursing care. Purpose: To describe neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) nurses' decision making regarding whether or not to disconnect the ventilator circuit when changing the infant's position and to investigate the grounds for their decisions. Methods: A descriptive questionnaire study with both quantitative and qualitative elements was conducted. In 2015, a convenience sample of nurses working in an NICU completed a questionnaire including both closed-ended and open-ended, free-text questions. Answers to the closed-ended questions were analyzed with descriptive statistics, whereas answers to the free-text questions were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results: Nurses' decisions on whether to disconnect or keep the ventilator circuit closed were based on the infant's needs for ventilator support. The nurses gave several reasons and motivations both for why they disconnected the circuit and for why they did not. The handling of the circuit and the reasons and motivations given were inconsistent among the nurses. Implications for Practice: This study highlights the need for continuous, repetitive education and training for NICU nurses, as well as demonstrating the importance of clear and distinct guidelines and working methods regarding the care of infants on ventilator support. Implications for Research: Future research should continue to find ways of working and handling an infant on ventilator support that are least harmful to the infant.",

    "abstract": "Dear NANN Colleagues, Over the past 2 years, the editorial board at Advances in Neonatal Care (ANC) with our recommendations as Co-Editors moved to implement changes in our manuscript peer review process. Some of our reviewers have written us about these changes, but we realized that other peer reviewers may not have noticed and authors may not be fully aware of the changes. Therefore, in this editorial, we highlight some of the current issues around scholarly peer review and the current peer review process used by ANC. PEER REVIEW HISTORY The use of peer reviewers is considered the “gold standard” in publishing to ensure that scholarly work is rigorous, accurate, and novel. In a recent issue of the Scholarly Kitchen, a blog sponsored by the Society for Scholarly Publishing,1 Melinda Baldwin, a physicist, was interviewed about her recent publication about the history of peer review.2 Dr Baldwin pointed out that while use of peers to review published work began in the mid-19th century with a few scholarly societies, widespread adoption of peer review publications did not occur until the 1970s. Peer review of manuscripts was widely adopted at the same time that research funding institutions like the National Institutes of Health were using peer reviewers to “judge” the credibility of grant applications. Peer review in journals was felt to be one way of justifying to funders the truthfulness and value of the grants they had funded.2 Widespread adoption of peer review in both research and clinical journal articles became common place by the 1980s. ACCEPTED PEER REVIEW PROCESSES When peer review was first initiated, both the reviewers (2-3) and author(s) knew the identity of the other individual(s) involved in the process. However, the Royal Society of London posited that reviewers would provide unfettered feedback if they were not named.2 Peer reviewers' identities were then blinded so that authors would not be aware of who provided feedback on their work. Subsequently reviewers were also blinded to the identity of authors. Blinding the identity of the author was thought to ensure independence and minimize bias in the recommendations an individual reviewer would provide to improve the manuscript.3 However, when reviewers are experts in their field, they often know and can recognize the work of their colleagues even when the author is not named. Therefore, the validity of a truly “blind” review is often called into question, especially when the community of scholars around a particular topic is relatively small. Currently, there are a wide variety of accepted practices in peer review.3,4 Many journals continue to use a double-blinded review process where both the author and reviewers are not known to each other. However, single-blinded review has become the most common form of review.3 In single-blinded reviews the author is identified to the reviewer, but the reviewers are not known to the authors. Other journals like the British Medical Journal employ a totally transparent peer review process.5 Authors and reviewers are both aware of the identity of the other, and if the manuscript is accepted for publication, the original submission, the reviewers' comments, the authors response to the reviewers, and the final manuscript are all available online. This process is felt to provide not only transparency within the process but also accountability and credit to the reviewers for the time and effort they provide in the process of publication of scholarly works.6,7 Finally, hybrid models of peer review include one of the above processes along with postpublication commentary and discussion to critique the quality of the work. The value of the manuscript is believed to be revealed in the discourse and ongoing citation record based on the commentary and discussion. Thus, the discussion can add to the impact and value of the work. Research about the peer review process has not provided information about a clear advantage of one review process over another.3 SUPPORT of ANC PEER REVIEWS Regardless of the process used for peer review, editors and authors alike must respect the time commitment involved in a thoughtful peer review. To support ANC reviewers, specific questions important to the journal are listed to facilitate the review. In addition, reviewers are provided continuing education credit for the time they take to complete the review. Finally, annually we recognize the ANC reviewers by publishing their names in ANC. Most recently ANC 's publisher, Wolters Kluwer (Lippincott) has designed a peer review training course available at the following Web site: http://wkauthorservices.editage.com/peer-reviewer-training-course/. We hope our current and future reviewers will check out the free course. For those who want to understand the peer review process even more thoroughly, there is a more comprehensive course available that does have a fee attached. ANC PEER REVIEW PROCESSES Currently, ANC uses single-blinded peer review. Our rationale for changing from double- to single-blinded review was twofold. First, in the neonatal nursing community, it is often difficult to fully blind a manuscript even with the authors' names and institutional affiliations not identified. In addition, the time from submission to peer review completion was often increased because manuscripts had to be sent back to authors for blinding of items they may have missed. Like double-blinded peer review, single-blinded reviewers are required to disclose any potential conflicts of interest that would preclude them from providing an unbiased peer review. Our peer reviewers are asked to complete the peer review within 2 weeks of accepting the assignment to shorten the time from the initial submission to author feedback. We also have recently changed our process and only send the manuscript to 2 peer reviewers to decrease the burden on our pool of ANC reviewers. See Figure 1 for a flowchart of the ANC review process.Figure 1: ANC peer review process flowchart.Thank you to all of our peer reviewers for sharing their expertise and taking the time to provide thoughtful review to our authors. We hope that others will consider joining our peer review team. If you are interested in finding out more about peer reviewing for ANC please contact us.

    "abstract": "Dear Drs Brandon and McGrath, We would like to comment on a recently published article in the August 2018 issue of Advances in Neonatal Care, “Comparison of Neonatal Nursing Practices for Determining Feeding Tube Insertion Length and Verifying Gastric Placement With Current Best Evidence” by Leslie A. Parker et al.1 We agree with the authors that further research is needed to determine the best method for nasogastric tube (NGT) insertion length. We also agree that further research is needed for NGT placement verification in this population as our study showed that 61% of the pediatric patients requiring an NGT in our prevalence study were in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).2 However, until that research is completed and publishes, the use of the nose-ear-mid-umbilicus (NEMU) method for estimating insertion length and the use of pH to verify NGT placement are the best answers we have. We want to recognize that the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia have used pH for many years as their standard for NGT placement verification.3 While we do not have RCTs validating that this practice in the NICU is effective, we also do not have case reports indicating that the use of pH has been ineffective. While we wait for a large, multicenter RCT to be done, nurses need to stop using methods known to be unreliable—auscultation and/or aspiration with visualization of gastric contents. We acknowledge that in the NICU population, data are lacking in this practice area, which prevents strong practice recommendations but given the serious/horrific outcome of an infant who is inadvertently fed into the lung,4 is it now wise to standardize care toward the use of the NEMU method for estimating insertion length and to pH to verify placement?5,6 Sincerely, Beth Lyman, MSN, RN, CNSC, FASPEN Chair, NOVEL Project Children's Mercy Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri Peggi Guenter, PhD, RN, FAAN, FASPEN American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition Silver Spring, Maryland",

    "abstract": "This issue of Advances in Neonatal Care is part 1 in a 2-part series on Human Milk Science. The use of human milk, which includes both mother's own milk (MOM) and donor human milk (DHM), is considered standard-of-care and this series spotlights the use of human milk to support high-risk infants. The aim of this series does not focus on “breastfeeding” at-risk infants, but explores the science of human milk including ways to enhance the use of human milk to optimize infant outcomes, evidence-based caregiving practices surrounding the use of human milk, and information neonatal nurses and other providers need to make the best decisions surrounding the use of human milk. Consuming MOM decreases prematurity-specific complications including necrotizing enterocolitis, late-onset sepsis, retinopathy of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and neurodevelopmental delays.1–7 However these health benefits are not limited to preterm very low-birth weight (VLBW) infants. Breastfeeding and consumption of MOM also reduce complications and improve the health of all infants including those born at higher gestational ages and those with congenital defects. While far less superior to MOM, DHM also improves the health of preterm infants and, in 2012, the American Academy of Pediatrics published recommendations that all premature infants weighing less than 1500 g be fed MOM and, if unavailable, should be fed DHM.8 In order to support these recommendations, it is necessary for neonatal nurses to be knowledgeable regarding the science surrounding human milk. Although DHM is recommended for use when MOM is unavailable, it is far inferior to the individual infant's MOM.9,10 Pasteurization reduces and/or eliminates many of the protective elements found in MOM including immunoglobulins, cytokines, growth factors, and beneficial bacteria.11,12 In addition, growth of infants fed DHM may be diminished due to decreased protein content and less fat absorption from inactivation of bile salt-stimulating lipase by pasteurization.11,13–16 Therefore, optimizing the amount of MOM fed to infants is essential. Unfortunately, formalized lactation support from internationally board-certified lactation consultants and other designated lactation personnel is often limited in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) where mothers often need round-the-clock lactation support. Neonatal nurses are therefore often called upon to provide lactation support and education to mothers. In order to provide mothers with the best possible care, it is necessary for neonatal nurses to understand barriers mothers face when providing MOM to their infant in the NICU. Using in-depth semi-structured interviews, Fernández Medina and colleagues describe the experiences of mothers of extremely preterm infants regarding barriers to providing MOM to their infants. Because mothers of infants in the NICU often struggle with an insufficient MOM supply, nurses must often provide lactation support focused on increasing MOM production. Being aware of women at risk for lactation difficulties allows neonatal nurses the opportunity to provide anticipatory guidance to mothers who will likely require significant lactation support. Obesity is now a national epidemic and is a known risk factor for compromised lactation success including initiation of expression/breastfeeding, MOM production, and sustained lactation.17 Robinson and colleagues provide a summary of the state of the science regarding not only implications of maternal overweight and obesity on successful lactation but also how these conditions may change the actual composition of MOM. While not universal, many NICUs require informed consent before providing DHM to infants. Unfortunately, because it is often bundled with standardized NICU treatment consents and obtained either before or soon after delivery, maternal retention and comprehension may be limited. Furthermore, findings of decreased MOM consumption when DHM is available suggest informed consent alone is insufficient and ongoing maternal education is essential.18 McGlothen-Bell and her collaborators provide an overall review of the ethics surrounding the consent process for providing DHM as well as an argument for the use of consistent and standardized consent for the use of DHM in the NICU. Nurses often focus on promoting breastfeeding and MOM consumption in mothers delivering VLBW preterm infants. However, mothers of infants not born preterm and with other diagnoses including congenital anomalies such as myelomeningocele may also be at risk for breastfeeding difficulties that may limit the amount of MOM their infant consumes. Using an evidence-based feeding pathway, Spatz and Froh describe the enteral feeding practices of infants with myelomeningocele including whether mothers had a personalized prenatal nutrition consultation, whether infants received human milk as their first feed, and whether they breastfed. Neonatal nurses partner with families in the NICU to provide infants with optimal evidence-based care. To provide this care, nurses need to provide families with evidence-based practical information regarding lactation, which has been adapted according to the family's specific educational and emotional needs. We hope you find this issue to be informative and that it assists you in providing lactation support to mothers of high-risk infants. Please stay-tuned for the next collection of articles regarding the science of human milk in the next issue of Advances in Neonatal Care.",

    "abstract": "Background: Benevolent injustice occurs when well-intentioned treatment efforts produce an outcome that limits the potential of a patient. The unintended harm can result in significant moral distress for the family and the healthcare team. Clinical Findings: We discussed an ethical dilemma regarding a neonate who had suspected seizure and hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy after home birth delivery. The healthcare team experienced moral distress about the mother's desire to not use anti-seizure medications and instead trial other interventions such as cuddling. Subsequently, clinical analysis ruled out a seizure disorder. Genetic studies on this neonate confirmed hereditary hyperekplexia, which presented as exaggerated Moro reflex and apnea that mimicked seizure. Intervention: We discussed how applying any one of the 4 basic ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, or justice could counteract benevolent injustice and moral distress. Outcomes: Discussions with the patient's mother and nurse allowed the team to overcome their reluctance to try the mother's treatment recommendations. This resulted in adopting the seemingly counterintuitive intervention of cuddling that turned out to be effective for this neonate with hereditary hyperekplexia. Practice Recommendations: The moral distress associated with benevolent injustice should be identified early to minimize long-term consequences to the patient, family, and healthcare team. Healthcare teams should learn to apply ethical principles when discussing patient care concerns in an unbiased manner. Guided ethical discussions allow us to be more efficient in providing family-centered care that aligns with the patient's best interest.",

    "abstract": "CULTURALLY SENSITIVE, FAMILY-CENTERED CARE: UNIQUE NEEDS OF THE MILITARY FAMILIES SERVING ABROAD AN OVERVIEW OF THE NAVAL MEDICAL SERVICES The United States Navy (USN) currently has 328,267 active duty and 97,219 reserve members serving in various roles throughout the world.1 Navy Medicine, the healthcare division of the USN, operates 17 US Naval Hospitals (USNHs) worldwide, 2 of which are located in Japan. One is on mainland Japan in Yokosuka2 near Tokyo and the other is located on the southern island of Okinawa.3 USNH-Okinawa is the Navy Medicine's largest overseas military treatment facility providing direct patient care to over 47,000 personnel on Okinawa and nearly 189,000 in the Western Pacific region.4 The USNH-Okinawa has a level III, 12-bed neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).5 USNH-Yokosuka is the largest facility in mainland Japan providing a wide range of emergency, inpatient, and outpatient care for approximately 43,000 active duty members and their families. The geographic service area for USNH-Yokosuka and its branch clinics stretches from the northern tip of Japan, south to Iwo-Jima, and west to Diego Garcia, and essentially covers the entire Indo-Asia-Pacific region.6 USNH-Yokosuka does not offer specialized care for high-risk newborns or high-risk pregnancies, leaving a gap in neonatal care for this region. To meet the specialized needs of this population, USNH-Yokosuka has established a system to make high-risk services available through a joint partnership with civilian Japanese neonatal services in the region. The aim of this report is to highlight this collaborative partnership. In addition, the efforts of naval service leadership have been discussed to better understand the care of the high-risk newborns who require admission to the NICU and their families while serving our country overseas.Navy Nursing members, the author, and the Neonatal Nurse Leadership from Kanagawa Children's Medical Center in attendance at the US-Japan Joint Nursing Symposium 2018.NAVAL HOSPITAL-YOKOSUKA The Clinical Nurse Specialist for the Maternal and Infant Unit, Lieutenant Commander (LCDR) Michelle Westcott, RN, MSN, CNS, reports that USNH-Yokosuka provides routine prenatal, labor, delivery, and postpartum care. Highly skilled midwifery service provides quality care in partnership with the obstetrical team at Yokosuka Naval Medicine. The care of high-risk mothers and newborns, such as premature births, requires collaboration with the network of Japanese hospitals in the region that provide specialized NICU care. USNH-Yokosuka obstetrical team provides quality prenatal care by monitoring the suitability and safety of pregnant patients for delivery at USNH-Yokosuka. When problems are identified, arrangements for maternal transfers to USNH-Okinawa or back to the United States are made to achieve optimal patient outcomes. However, the dynamic nature of pregnancy and labor and delivery may prevent the opportunity to provide maternal transport to an appropriate military or US civilian facility. The USNH-Yokosuka transport team is used to transport high-risk mothers or moderately ill infants to Japanese accepting facilities. However, in emergent cases when mothers cannot be transported or following the delivery of an extremely preterm infant(s), Japanese teams are requested to transport the infant/infants to the outlying Japanese facility. These high-risk infants remain in the Japanese NICUs until they are stable, and then they are transferred back to USNH Yokosuka for newborn screening and a short period of observation before discharge home with their families. Although USNH-Okinawa has a 12-bed, level III NICU with neonatology service,5 the 1000-mile distance between USNH-Yokosuka and Okinawa is neither practical for families nor realistic for transport of high-risk infants in urgent or emergent situations. LCDR Westcott reports that annual transport needs vary; however, upwards of 20 cases including high-risk infants and high-risk pregnant mothers are transferred from USNH-Yokosuka to surrounding Japanese hospitals. The bed availability determines transfer location while also facilitating closeness for infants and families. The collaboration between the US and Japanese hospitals is not without challenges, increasing stressors for families that could have potential long-term consequences. CHALLENGES FOR THE NAVY FAMILIES AND ALSO FOR THE JAPANESE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS Navy families are far removed from their own family support system during the time they serve their nation from posts abroad. Naval support systems are in place; however, not having your own immediate family and close friends nearby during a prolonged hospitalization with an ill child is a highly stressful experience both psychologically and physically. Although the Japanese hospitals where their infants are transported to may be in the “region,” the distance can still require extended driving times—as much as an hour or more. Frequent travel off-base to the foreign hospital is not included in typical training for the anticipated “overseas” experience for Navy service members or their families. It is also rare for Navy families serving in Japan to have language proficiency in the native language of Japanese. The Japanese hospital's standard practice does not typically include readily available English written materials, putting English-speaking patients and families at a disadvantage. It is common to find only a handful of nursing staff who may speak some English, but rarely at a proficient level. Some of the physician staff members may speak near-proficient English; however, his or her availability at the bedside is limited. A complex combination of barriers potentially creates further complications for Navy families, especially when the hospitalization is prolonged. Annual transports of up to 20 infants from USNH-Yokosuka to Japanese hospitals may not sound significant to readers whose practice carries out significant number of transports yearly; however, the impact of these transport cases, which originate from the Navy base, must be viewed in terms of the “total patient days of hospitalization,” and the day-to-day struggle and stress Navy families endure in a foreign culture. We must also consider the day-to-day efforts the Japanese care providers make attempting to meet both the medical needs of the infants and the support for the families. In the NICUs in North America, we strive to welcome NICU families who speak limited English or no English at all, who may not have lived in the United States for a long time, so that our care quality, both actual and perceived, is not negatively impacted. The NICU environment is often perceived as “foreign,” “unwelcoming,” or “intimidating” even in the absence of language or cultural barriers. Table 1 summarizes some of the barriers and challenges that present to Navy families as well as the challenges expressed by Japanese hospital healthcare providers when Navy families face crisis in the NICUs in Japan. TABLE 1. - Comparison of needs for Families and Healthcare Providers Naval Families Japanese Healthcare Providers Limited Japanese language ability for reading, writing, and understanding the necessary forms/documents that are presented on admission and throughout the NICU hospitalization. Require interpreter or staff fluent in English to discuss complex medical information. Language barriers (when translators are not available) prevent families from receiving frequent and timely updates regarding the infant(s) condition from the care providers. Difficulties for the families to verbally express their concerns or anxiety in a timely manner, or to ask simple questions about infant's physiology when questions arise. Potential delays in parental engagement with the infants' care, which may cause additional negative impact on parent–infant bonding. Challenges felt by the families related to the cultural differences in the norm of what family may desire in time of crisis, which can lead to a potential misunderstanding or additional stress. Differences in how family-centered care concept is approached by the Japanese NICUs and how cultural influence may shape the concept and attitude impacting the unit policies and practice standards in a way that is stressful for the Navy families (eg, limited or no visitation for sibling/grandparents and limited visitation hours). Difficulty understanding medication names or purposes for medications. Even a commonly known medication may have a unique name in Japan. Potential confusion for families caused by a translation done with inaccurate terminology leading the families to receive wrong information, thus causing significant distress (eg, healthcare providers may explain that “The pregnancy cannot continue due to the severe maternal eclampsia,” indicating the need for an emergency cesarean section by using words that can be easily taken to mean “termination of pregnancy.” This example was given from the actual experience of the third author.). The sense of “Our family represents the US Navy” may make Navy families feel that they have to be “tough” during the most difficult times. This may prevent the families from making efforts to express honest concerns in a timely manner. Difficulty for receiving facility to collect maternal history in a timely manner. Challenges in the provision of frequent and timely education to parents due to the language barrier, potentially leading to a delayed parental acquisition of knowledge and skills needed to build confidence as parents. Difficulty for the healthcare team to help develop parental sense of being a part of the care team. Difficulty extending emotional support in a meaningful manner due to the language barrier. Some of the Japanese hospitals rely on the external services for interpreters; however, these services must be scheduled in advance. Abbreviation: NICU, neonatal intensive care unit. CURRENT EFFORTS BEING MADE Navy leadership is aware of actual or potential obstacles that service members experience in the host country hospital. Currently, a bilingual Japanese civilian staff that has previous nursing experience is incorporated into the care team by USNH-Yokosuka to support the navy families who are hospitalized off-base. This member visits the Japanese NICUs once a week to serve as an interpreter, visit with, and encourage Navy families. On these visits, complex matters are discussed with the healthcare team to ensure accurate information is communicated to families while any special needs of the families can be relayed to the care providers. To support this partnership, Naval Hospital leadership initiated a US–Japan Joint Nursing Symposium, inviting the local Japanese nursing community to an annual face-to-face meeting. The objective of this joint meeting is to nurture the cross-cultural professional relationship and to develop opportunities to improve the partnership in coordination of care, to optimize the experiences of patients and families. USNH-Yokosuka hosted the 4th Annual US–Japan Joint Nursing Symposium on February 12, 2018, at the Admiral Arleigh A. Burke Officer's Club on the Naval Base in Yokosuka, Japan. Nearly 100 nurses (Japanese, navy, air force, and civilian U.S. nurses working in USNH Yokosuka) representing numerous area hospitals where Navy service members or their families have received care or collaborated with in the past attended the event. The US–Japan joint participants were able to share healthcare challenges, and be inspired by the collaborative nursing spirit that ties them together in spite of the differences in culture or language. Invited speakers were from both the maternal–infant and the pediatric specialty care areas. The former Commanding Officer of USNH, Captain Rosemary C. Malone, MD, delivered her opening message with words of sincere gratitude to the Japanese hospital representatives for this innovative partnership. LCDR Westcott presented her sincere and heart-felt words of “thank you” by recognizing each hospital that was represented at this symposium. Several Japanese presenters discussed the efforts as well as the immense sense of responsibility they felt as they cared for the Navy families and their infants. One presenter reported the efforts they have made to translate some of the materials into English, especially the initial admission consent forms. These materials will be used to facilitate communication with the Navy families at her institution. Japanese presenters also expressed the challenges they experienced when collecting maternal history or delivery information. It is not easy for the Japanese staff to review the history information sent with the patients from the Naval Hospital that is all written in English. One presenter stated that, in some emergency transports, all they know is “a baby is coming from the base” without a detailed history, making preparation a challenge. Wakako Eklund, DNP, NNP-BC, a NANN and NANNP member, was invited to present at this event. Her presentation, titled, “Our collaborative team of 29 NNPs and 10 Neonatologists!” described the common neonatal practices in the United States as Dr. Eklund practices in Nashville, Tennessee. She shared how a large geographic area is covered by the partnership of neonatologists and neonatal nurse practitioners in collaboration with area hospitals and their staff. She discussed the challenges in caring for non-English-speaking families whose infants are admitted to NICUs in the region. She also described that her Nashville practice has transported numerous infants from a military base in the region when higher level of NICU care was required and of the challenges that families face off-base. These challenges aligned with the collaborative practice between USNH-Yokosuka and area Japanese hospitals. Her message included the value of culturally sensitive and family-centered care, emphasizing how families' stress can be minimized by providing family support with various strategies especially when families do not speak English. She shared her own experience of caring for Japanese families with premature infants in the United States, and how intensely families seek someone of their own language/culture when in crisis for comfort or reassurance. This, she shared, is necessary for non-English-speaking families to feel confident in the care their infants are receiving, and to feel secure in an incredibly insecure moment in their lives. Navy nurses asked what more they can do to prepare the Navy families before they go to the Japanese hospitals, and they also expressed their observations of how the healthcare culture appeared to differ significantly between the United States and Japan. Dr. Eklund was able to visit with the nurse who makes the weekly visits to the NICU to meet with Navy families who are being cared for in the Japanese facilities. She learned from Japanese NICU nurses about the difficulty they experience as they take care of Navy families in a manner satisfying to both the Navy families and to the care providers. Not being able to fully engage with families in deep discussions with the simple verbal communication is challenging, and they shared concerns about not being able to adequately understand the families' feelings while the families were not adequately able to express their needs to the caregivers, thus potentially adding unnecessary stressors for all. Cristal Grogan, a former Navy wife who underwent an emergency cesarean section to deliver her son at 29 weeks' gestation while her husband was stationed in Spain, offers the following reflection based on her lived experience in a “foreign NICU.” Cristal is an active member of the “Premie Parent Alliance (PPA),”7 which is a dynamic network of former NICU parents, with the mission to advocate for the needs of NICU families by closely collaborating with the members of the neonatal, pediatric, and perinatal organizations. PPA is actively engaging in neonatal initiatives at the local, state, national, and also at an international front. My son had a complicated course in the NICU. But I truly believe that so much of the trauma we experienced as parents, and the PTSD [posttraumatic stress disorder] that I may always live with, could have been minimized by the simple ability to “speak” or “communicate intelligently” back and forth with the care team. The biggest stressor and the distress experienced as a result was mainly centered around the communication barrier, specifically the lack of access to interpreters. We had so many questions and we sensed that we were viewed as a burden to the NICU staff because of our lack of knowledge to speak the host-country's language, Spanish. Because of not being able to fully understand how my son's condition was improving, progressing, or regressing in concrete terms, I always feared the worst, traumatizing myself every day. My difficulty during those days negatively impacted my ability to bond with my dear son for well over a year post-discharge. It affected my mental health and my overall ability to care for my son, including breast feeding or to create special memories/moments with him during the early phase of his life. Today, it is known that PTSD is a reality to many NICU families even when there is no cultural or language barriers, and I understood later that my condition was far worse for a reason that was explainable. While we provide culturally sensitive care in the United States to non-English-speaking families from other cultural backgrounds, we must also remember some of our men and women who are serving abroad and experiencing culturally stressful hospitalization experiences. Dr. Eklund has contacted some of the Japanese hospital leadership to inquire how she could support such efforts as document translation, creation of English educational materials, or to participate in any future joint initiatives to facilitate any efforts using her language and neonatal expertise. She considers it an honor to have been a part of the 4th US–Japan Joint Nursing Symposium and to take part in any future efforts by keeping in touch with those NICU members in Japan where the Navy babies and their families are being cared for. She sensed a highly motivated collaborative spirit between the US Navy nurses and the Japanese nurses in attendance and is confident that the continued joint partnership between USNH-Yokosuka and the Japanese healthcare community in the region will continue to offer positive changes to the experiences of Navy families and their infants.",

    "abstract": "ENGAGING NURSES IN NEC SYMPOSIUM 2019 To inspire nurses to attend, the April 2017 issue of Advances in Neonatal Care (ANC) reported how a parent-led advocacy group, the NEC Society, was preparing for an inaugural NEC Symposium1 made possible by funding from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI).2 Hosted by the University of California, Davis, from April 5 to 7, 2017, the NEC Symposium was a phenomenal success with Northern California NANN chapter exhibiting at the symposium, having 2 nursing members as speakers, and nearly one-fourth of the participants from nursing profession, some of them being parents of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)-affected children. It marked a significant milestone toward innovative interdisciplinary collaboration to tackle NEC, not only in US neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) but globally as well. This article informs NANN members what has been accomplished since the inaugural NEC Symposium, what is planned for the second NEC Symposium in 2019, and how NANN is engaged with the NEC Society's mission. HOW NANN AND THE MICHIGAN CHAPTER OF NANN ARE ENGAGED NANN and the State of Michigan Chapter SMANN will be exhibiting at the NEC Society's symposium. NEC is a devastating condition and neonatal nurses are frequently the first to notice the subtle signs: a child who previously tolerated feedings—but now has a distended abdomen, increasing aspirates, and lethargy. We vigorously do all in our power to support the affected infants and their family members, celebrate when recovery occurs, and grieve with families when the disease overpowers against all the efforts. NANN's role of advocating for and encouraging parent involvement in their child's care mirrors one of the Society's stated goals “Empowering patients and families, and supporting their engagement as part of the baby's care team.” As NANN members, we have the opportunity to make an impact on the outcomes of infants and families affected by NEC. The NEC Society's webpage contains valuable information for families and clinicians. NANN President Joan Rikli invites NANN members to consider accessing this site to learn more about resources and opportunities to become involved in this important work. NANN members' participation at the upcoming NEC Symposium would boost the visibility of nursing efforts toward the goal to end NEC. Information such as the NEC Society's Online Support Community designed for affected parents3 or other resources would be highly useful. NEC SOCIETY FOUNDED BY FAMILIES BLINDSIDED BY NEC The NEC Society was born after Jennifer and Noah Canvasser lost their 11-month-old son, Micah, to complications of NEC. Jennifer Canvasser, founder and director of the NEC Society, recently shared her family's story with SIGNEC,4 which is a Special Interest Group for NEC based in the United Kingdom, established by Dr Minesh Khashu in 2012.5 Jennifer never thought that she would be an NICU mother, since she was going to go through her pregnancy with utmost care to do everything “right” to prevent any complications. Jennifer stated that premature births can occur suddenly and that she was utterly not prepared for an NICU journey. Jennifer's twins were born at 27 weeks' gestation in 2012, and both of them conquered their typical NICU milestones by the time they were 6 weeks old. Once the twins had each reached 5 lb, Jennifer shared that she felt like they were “home free.” She and her husband never dreamed of NEC attacking Micah, blindsiding them all. She recollects how Micah's NEC shocked everyone, including the care team. Micah was on peritoneal dialysis for a few weeks, but it was ineffective. Continuous renal replacement therapy (constant hemodialysis) was provided for 3 months, and then he relied upon intermittent hemodialysis until he passed away at 11 months. After Micah died, the Canvasser's and their parent colleagues, Erin Umberger and Ryan Raab, who lost their daughter, Sarah, to NEC became committed to driving research and preventing NEC. The NEC Society, a nonprofit organization, was founded in 2014 to improve outcomes for infants who are at risk for NEC by bringing together diverse stakeholders to facilitate research. Since 2014, the NEC Society has succeeded in connecting patient–family advocates from around the world who have been impacted by NEC, as well as industry partners, scientists, and clinicians to raise awareness for NEC, identify best practices to prevent NEC, and ultimately to spread the hope to 1 day prevent it for good. INTENT AND OUTCOMES OF 2017 NEC SYMPOSIUM The 2017 NEC Symposium theme was, “A Transdisciplinary Approach to Improved Outcomes,” with 4 overarching goals. The goals were to (1) review state of the science of pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment for NEC; (2) establish transdisciplinary collaborations to accelerate implementation of evidence-based practices; (3) explore methods to empower and engage families; and (4) serve as a venue to scaffold new collaborations and sharing of research resources (eg, biobanks, clinical databases, and tools).1 The parent-engagement theme was strongly influenced by a study that the NEC Society did with Dr Samir Gadepalli from the University of Michigan to identify what parents knew about NEC before their infant was diagnosed and how they wanted to be involved.6 This event was significant for many reasons. It was not only the first meeting organized by the NEC Society, but also the first NEC-focused transdisciplinary meeting held in North America.7 This meeting catapulted the scientific, clinical, and parent-advocate communities into new levels of effectiveness. For more detail, see the NEC Symposium Executive Summary at https://necsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2017-nec-symposium-summary.pdf. THE NEC SOCIETY'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN 2018 The NEC Society kept its momentum after the successful NEC Symposium in 2017 by accomplishing numerous important achievements. One of the achievements was a special issue in Seminars in Pediatric Surgery, which addressed the key topics and speakers from the symposium.8 The entire issue covers a wide array of topics regarding NEC and is downloadable for free (https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/seminars-in-pediatric-surgery/vol/27/issue/1). An adherence score for NEC prevention was also validated and published with the support of the NEC Society in 2018.9 Other achievements include being awarded the second PCORI award to support the 2019 NEC Symposium, participation in the California Marathon in honor of more than 50 infants who were affected by NEC raising over $6500, establishment of May 17th as the annual international NEC awareness day, creating a parent-engagement video with the University of Arizona, and bolstering activities among the research collaborative.10 2019 NEC SYMPOSIUM (ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN; JUNE 2-5, 2019) The NEC Society board members and program planners began working together to organize the second NEC Symposium immediately after the success of the inaugural 2017 meeting. The Second NEC Symposium will convene on June 2 to 5, 2019, at the University of Michigan (UoM) in collaboration with the UoM Section of Pediatric Surgery and supported by an engagement award from the PCORI.11 The second NEC Symposium will welcome families impacted by NEC, neonatal professionals, scientists, any other members in the healthcare team, industry partners, and members from regulatory agencies. Its theme is, “Breaking Down the Barriers of NEC Prevention and Treatment.”12 Keynote presentations titled, “Uniting Providers and Patient-Families towards NEC Prevention and Improved Outcomes” will be delivered by the president of the Vermont Oxford Network, Dr Roger Soll. Dr Mark Underwood of University of California, Davis, will provide the “Recent Breakthrough and Promising Directions” regarding NEC on the opening day. Leading scientists and clinicians are faculty, including NANN member and ANC board member, Dr Sheila Gephart, of the University of Arizona College of Nursing. Most topics will be of interest to NICU nurses, including issues around feeding, fortifiers, NEC risk awareness and timely identification tools, and ways to unite teams to avoid NEC and advance the science. The unique transdisciplinary approach offered by the NEC Symposium will “provide the setting for discovery, collaboration and sustained partnerships on research,”11 while demonstrating the value of patients and families to be included in discussion and partnership from planning to implementation. Indeed, the NEC Society is certified as a “Patients Included” meeting.13 “Patients Included” meetings must meet the designated 5 charter clauses to ensure the meeting is not only meaningful to the clinicians and scientists, but also highly relevant to the patients and families as participants, planners, and presenters.14 One of the highlights of the program, the Patient-Family Keynote Panel presentation will include an NEC survivor, a parent of an NEC survivor and a parent who lost a child to NEC.15 Compelling presentations will enhance clinicians' understanding of NEC family's perspectives. A full program brochure can be downloaded at https://necsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NEC_Symposium_AnnArbor_2019.pdf, and registration information can be found at https://www.eventbrite.com/e/nec-symposium-registration-46901501654. In accordance with the fifth charter clause for “Patient Included” certification, the NEC Symposium will be posting live meeting highlights with photographs on social media with the use of the hashtag #NEC2019 throughout and after the symposium in June. Please stay tuned.",

    "abstract": "We thank the authors of the Letter to the Editor for their thoughtful comments regarding standardization of feeding tube care in neonates using the “nose-ear-midway to the umbilicus” (NEMU) method for insertion length determination and pH analysis to verify gastric placement. The goal of our recently published article was not to recommend practice guidelines but to (1) critically review available evidence supporting methods to determine insertion lengths and verify gastric placement of feeding tubes in critically ill infants; (2) provide information regarding methods used by neonatal nurses to determine insertion length and verify gastric placement of feeding tubes; and (3) demonstrate discrepancies between procedures supported by existing research and clinical nursing practice. Our findings illustrate inconsistency between nursing practice and evidence-based methods and thus support the need for standardizing methods for both feeding tube insertion depth determination and gastric placement verification. Practice standards would increase the likelihood of nurses utilizing the most reliable available methods, thus potentially improving patient care. However, our findings also emphasize the critical need for well-designed research to provide more robust evidence to support recommended methods. Sincerely, Leslie A.

    "abstract": "Background: Family-centered care is founded upon collaboration between parents and healthcare professionals, caring for a child and parents as one entity. The unfamiliar neonatal environment and complexity of care can make family-centered care challenging. Purpose: To explore neonatal nurses' perceptions of family-centered care and parents' cultural needs. Methods: This was a qualitative descriptive study using interviews to gather data from registered nurses, and analyzed using inductive content analysis. Results: Ten neonatal nurses participated in online interviews, lasting an average of 25 minutes. Parents' cultural needs were poorly understood and assumed synonymous with family-centered care. While all acknowledged the importance of family-centered care, most described tasks to parent–infant bonding, rather than a broader embodiment of family-centered care. In time of uncertainty, emergent clinical priorities took priority over a family-centered approach to care. Cultural care was poorly understood, and care tasks associated with supporting parent–infant bonding suggest further work is necessary to promote embodiment of family-centered care beyond individual tasks. While emergent clinical priorities and neonate well-being will always be the priority, finding a way to respond that concords with the ethos of family-centered care is also essential. Implications for Practice and Research: Clear and consistent leadership is needed to demonstrate greater embodiment of family-centered care, which includes cultural care for parents. Strong leadership and targeted education are key to supporting this change.

    "abstract": "Supporting parenting in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is one of the most challenging but rewarding aspects of patient care in neonatal nursing. As nurses, we are uniquely positioned to offer support, advice, and guidance in the transition to parenthood. Yet, sometimes parents perceive us as “gatekeepers” to their newborn rather than facilitators of access. As the neonatal nursing community works to improve care for all patients, parenting in the NICU is one element of care that needs to remain at the forefront. Consider the following experience of a parent, who has been on “both sides” of the incubator as a NICU nurse and then a NICU parent. OUR STORY After 12 years working in high-risk perinatal care and level III NICUs, I found myself on the other side of the bed, watching my child received the same care I had provided countless times to other babies and their families. Instead of guiding a parent through one of the most challenging and difficult experiences of their lives, I was the one now in need of support and guidance. My daughter, Aurelia, was born in August 2022 at 27 weeks 5 days of gestation, after a placental abruption, which began at home. On the night Aurelia was born, I woke up to a significant amount of blood that quickly increased. I immediately sensed what was happening. As my husband was speeding to the hospital through overnight construction traffic, I was acutely aware of what laid before us. If we both survived, our whole family was facing months of uncertainty, anxiety, and separation. I wept for my baby, myself, my husband, and my 2 other children at home. How were we going to do this? I delivered Aurelia at the hospital where I worked for 10 years—with much of that time spent in their large, high-acuity level III NICU. Although I was no longer working in that unit, I called the NICU charge nurse from the L&D waiting room and explained our situation. Even though she did not know who I was, I told her to prepare for a STAT 27-weeker and I needed to know which provider was on call. She cautiously gave me details about the delivery team and assured me they were getting a space ready for my baby. The nurse in labor and delivery triage kept telling me everything was going to be okay while trying to find Aurelia's heart tones. After the third time, I asked her to stop saying it was okay. I knew this was a preterm abruption and nothing about this situation was okay. I needed to hear my baby's heartbeat and get to the OR as quickly as possible. I needed to know she was still alive, and we both needed to be saved. I thought of my 2 boys at home and wanted so badly to be able to see them again. I wanted my baby to survive despite all the potential challenges ahead of her. OUR PRIVILEGE I want to pause here and take a moment to acknowledge the immense privilege I carried with me into our NICU stay. Not only did I have experience and knowledge of the NICU environment and the medical care necessary for my baby's survival, but my positionality as a White woman with adequate employment and good insurance. We had a good support network providing childcare so that my husband and I could be in the NICU daily. Additionally, I had already established care with a therapist, who was also a NICU parent, as we embarked on our own NICU journey. I had so many moments sitting at Aurelia's bedside thinking about my struggles and wondering if I was struggling this much, despite my privilege, how much more challenging it must be for other families. If it's this hard for me, I can't imagine how other families did it. During the first few days of our hospitalization, I tried to be “easy” parent. Because of my experience, I knew we had a long stay ahead of us, and I didn't want to develop a reputation. I accommodated the nurses, thought of their tasks and schedules before my own, and felt the constant tension of wanting to interject when it wasn't the way I would have done it. This all changed for me after Aurelia's first bath. I coordinated with the nurse to be present for Aurelia's first bath at 3 am on her fourth day of life while I was still inpatient. That night, I fell deep asleep for the first time since she was born, and I woke up in a panic at 03:09, knowing immediately that I might have missed my window. I rushed to the NICU as quickly as I possibly could, considering my postpartum, postoperative recovery. I arrived at her bed at 03:14 to her nurse putting away the plastic bath basin. She turned to me and said, “We said three o'clock.” Those 4 words completely shattered me, and I felt an intense wave of grief flood me. I sat down at her bedside and cried the hardest I had ever cried in my life. It was in this moment that I realized being the “good parent” or “easy parent” was not meeting my needs nor my daughter's. Aurelia may have been taken out of my body, but here in the NICU, I felt like she was not mine. I was at the mercy of the nurses, doctors, respiratory therapists, and countless other people overseeing her care. I was outnumbered and terrified; all my previous experience did not prepare me for this moment. IMPORTANCE OF PRESENCE Missing Aurelia's first bath put everything into perspective for me. I was/am her mother; that's who she needed me to be, her advocate. I would do whatever it took to be heard and supported. One of the most frustrating experiences during her NICU stay was the constant reminder to “just be her mom right now.” When I heard comments like this, what I understood the team to be saying was, “Don't ask too many questions. Just sit quietly. I'll let you know when you can interact with her.” The irony is that while they were telling me to be her mother, there were more moments when the opportunity to be her mother was not possible or taken from me. It is a mother's job to bathe, hold, feed, and care for her infant, but in the NICU, those activities often require permission: to be given permission from the “gatekeepers.” The conflict between my personal and professional understanding of the situation further complicated my traumatic experiences. I knew as a professional that there were legitimate reasons for some of the responses I was given, but as a mother, there was nothing any of the nurses could say that I would find acceptable. I was trying to be her mother, yet it was so hard! There were so many competing interests: how do I integrate my knowledge as a mother and my experience as a nurse? So, I decided to be myself and lean into the duality of my role as Aurelia's mom and as a NICU professional. I was authentic and honest with the team. I started with transparent communication despite it being perceived as negative. Some offered a sympathetic ear and a shoulder to cry on, others seemed to take it personally and tried to appeal to my sense of “knowing better.” When offered unsolicited advice, I would remind them that my experience was unique and valid. The times that I felt the most supported as her mother were when I was able to express my authentic emotions about what was happening—the everchanging mixture of pride, fear, love, anger, and gratitude I felt at any given moment. A few colleagues were consistent sources of support. They provided meals, acknowledged the disappointment, stress, and grief we were experiencing while also celebrating every weight gain, skin-to-skin session, and successful eating experience. I will forever be grateful for their kindness and support. IMPORTANCE OF PARENTING AND PRESENCE Parental–infant separation is inherently traumatic. Human beings are social beings that need human connection to thrive and so the effect of being separated from and not able to hold your baby after birth is a common source of trauma reported by former NICU parents, which also increases their risk for developing posttraumatic stress disorder.1 When an emergency and the need for life-saving care disrupts the bonding process, the sequela of events that follow can negatively impact parents and infants. Postpartum Support International2 lists NICU admission as an example of trauma and risk for developing postpartum posttraumatic stress disorder (P-PTSD). Symptoms include “intrusive re-experiencing of a past traumatic event... flashbacks or nightmares, avoidance of stimuli associated with the event ... persistent increased arousal (irritability, difficulty sleeping, hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response), anxiety and panic attacks, feeling a sense of unreality and detachment.”3 The American Psychiatric Association estimates 17% of parents experience P-PTSD or birth-related trauma—a number that only includes those who meet clinical criteria for diagnosis as many more parents experience P-PTSD symptoms.4 But what many former NICU parents will tell you, is that even after leaving the NICU, the NICU never really leaves you. NICU parents remain at risk for developing P-PTSD up to a year after their infant's discharge.1,5 Every noticeable difference from your baby gets mentally tagged and then the worry sets in wondering if it was connected to their birth. Is this her normal or is it because she was born early or in the NICU? These lingering questions make it even harder to process the trauma exposure from the NICU. I have always been a strong advocate of trauma-informed care (TIC) and have integrated TIC principles into every class I teach as a neonatal clinical nurse educator. I remember telling my therapist during one of our virtual sessions, as I sat in my car in between care times, that I felt like I was disassociating—like I was watching a movie about the NICU as if it was happening to some other family. Again, all my professional experience and training couldn't have possibly prepared me for this traumatic experience, even though I knew what to expect from the environment. Even the most clinically benign NICU admission can be traumatic, and processing that trauma takes time. During our NICU journey, I experienced the effects of toxic positivity, which I had not recognized before. Toxic positivity is defined as “dismissing negative emotions and responding to distress with false reassurances rather than empathy.”6 When people are uncomfortable or are unsure of what to say, they often rely on vague or empty statements. The team kept telling me over and over to “be grateful,” “this will all be over soon,” or “at least she's growing/doing well/not requiring a lot of respiratory support.” My reaction to these comments highlighted how dismissive they were and reminded me of all the times I said similar things to other parents. For example, during her first and only septic workup, I was told “Hey! It's her first one. It's not a NICU stay without a workup or two. I'm surprised it hasn't happened already” and while I understood this sentiment as a professional, as a parent, it shattered my emotional composure. It was one of our worst days in the NICU, and these comments did nothing to validate or acknowledge the worry and fear we were feeling. In short, I learned language matters. If nothing else changes in your clinical practice after reading this or other articles, other than removing the phrase “at least” in your communication with parents, then that will be a win for me. Even though I was deeply grateful that this was only her first workup and that she was getting the right care at the right time, I was still upset about the pain my daughter was feeling and concerned about implications of the results. Multiple things can be true at once: parents can be grateful, disappointed, scared, and angry at the same time. Statements that are dismissive of parents' emotions and concerns can further exacerbate their traumatic experience and distrust of providers. Given the focus of individualizing care for infants, we must also acknowledge and individualize the emotional support provided to parents and not be dismissive of their experience. VALIDATION AND EMOTIONAL SUPPORT In healthcare, we often focus on the short-term outcomes. Nowhere is that truer than the NICU. We celebrate every discharge and pat ourselves on the back for a job well done of getting a baby home. We reminisce about former patients and enjoy seeing holiday cards and getting updates at return visits or reunions, but so much more could be done to connect us with the lived experiences of our patients and their families as they navigate the transition to parenthood in an unfamiliar environment. The care we provide today potentially impacts every one of their tomorrows. Why wouldn't we want to support their family's transition to home in the best way possible? In sum, Aurelia's 75-day stay in the NICU was clinically uneventful. I owe that in part to the high-quality care she received, but I also believe our consistent presence in the NICU as her parents played a protective role in her outcomes. Validation fosters resilience and resilience mitigates the impact of trauma. My hope in sharing my experience is to empower more NICU professionals to choose to foster resilience in our patients and their families. We hope that this special series, Parenting in the NICU, offers new insights, challenges conventional practices in the NICU, and sparks a desire to promote care that values and validates the parent's role in the care of their child during a NICU hospitalization. Let's meet parents where they are at, knowing the lasting impacts our choices have on their transition to parenthood. –Jessica Barnes, MSN, RN, RNC-NIC, NPD-BC Trauma Informed Professional Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia –Ashlee J.

    "abstract": "Background: The anxiety and uncertain outcome of an admission of a seriously ill infant to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) can cause great stress for parents and contribute to poor mental health outcomes. Early implementation of family-centered palliative care (PC) may provide support for NICU parents. Key concepts of early PC in the NICU include shared decision-making, care planning, and support for coping with distress. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore parent experiences during their child's NICU admission with the early PC practices of shared decision-making, care planning, and coping with distress. Methods: Qualitative descriptive methodology was used. Strategies of reflexive journaling, peer debriefing, and data audits were used to enhance trustworthiness. Parents (N = 16) were interviewed, and data were analyzed by conventional content analysis. Targeted recruitment of fathers occurred to ensure they comprised 25% of sample. Results: Parents' descriptions of decision-making were contextualized in gathering information to make a decision, the emotional impact of the decision, and influences on their decision-making. In experiences with care planning, parents described learning to advocate, having a spectator versus participant role, and experiencing care planning as communication. Key themes expressed regarding parental coping were exposure to trauma, survival mode, and a changing support network. Implications for Practice and Research: These findings highlight key areas for practice improvement: providing more support and collaboration in decision-making, true engagement of parents in care planning, and encouraging peer support and interaction in the NICU and in online communities.",

    "abstract": "The first time I saw my daughter Mira was about 12 hours after she was born; it was the middle of the night, though I couldn't have told you what time it was. Someone wheeled me down a bright white hall, through the whoosh of automatic doors and into the NICU, and to a stop in front of the Giraffe incubator that held my 845-gram baby. Her wrinkled little face grimaced around an endotracheal tube; there was a catheter where her umbilical cord had been, her toe glowed pinkish red. She was surrounded by rows of other babies like her, all immobilized in plastic wizardry—the incubator seemed as complicated and as impenetrable as a sedan. I didn't know where I was, who I was. Our nurse, Geri, came close, helped me stand, and spoke blessedly matter-of-factly: She said congratulations and called me \"mom,\" the first person to do so. Then she said: \"You can touch her.\" I stared blankly. I could touch her? I didn't know where to start. How did I open this contraption? Where was it safe to touch her? What kind of mother was I? I knew nothing—don't mothers know how to take care of their children? How could I be this child's mother if I didn't even know how to touch her? With Geri's friendly prodding, I gingerly popped open the porthole and placed my pointer finger on the arch of one of Mira's tiny feet. I wanted her to know it was me, but of course there was no sign of recognition. I hadn't noticed that my hospital gown was hanging open in the back. Without missing a beat, Geri slipped behind me and tied me up, so my backside, in giant hospital underwear, wasn't hanging out. Then she busied herself, giving me time. Geri was a veteran. Just to look at her was to know her competence. When I think about that moment now, what stands out to me is that all of us were in different worlds, overlaid on each other. The NICU is not one place, it is many places: There is the world of the parents, who are having the most frightening days of their lives, dropped into a setting in which nothing makes sense. It felt to me like suddenly becoming illiterate, or being lost in a country where you don't speak the language. (And some parents don't, which makes the experience even harder.) And then there was the world of the nurses, for whom the day of my daughter's birth was a Sunday evening at work like every other Sunday evening at work. The nurses were in a world that they understood—the babies and their impossible bodies, the machinery, the numbers bleeping on the monitors above. In fact, the nurses were in their element, their expertise honed precisely to this space, to this technology, to these patients. It is very strange to feel so profoundly disoriented, and to look around and see this cadre of experts who are clearly keeping your baby alive. I had the distinct feeling of being stripped: Stripped of all my ways of knowing and my identity, both as the person I was and as the mother I hoped to be. I fell back on ways I had navigated health care settings before, so I took notes. I am a journalist, and taking notes is second nature, a way to understand. But a resident saw me writing furiously and laughed, as though it were cute: \"Oh, Mommy's taking notes,\" he said. This, of course, was totally inappropriate, but at the time, I was just embarrassed. My ways of knowing were not applicable here. I felt superfluous, not useful, certainly not indispensable, like a mother should be for her baby. This feeling has been noted in the literature: \"struggling to mother.\"1 The transition to motherhood, or parenthood, can be difficult under the best of circumstances. In the NICU, it is exponentially more so. Nurses can stand with parents in that rift, in the chasm between what we thought motherhood would be, and what it has turned out to be. Both research and common sense suggest that nurses have tremendous power to help parents feel competent and bonded as a family—which can positively affect outcomes for both the baby and family. Because, especially in the early days, to act like a mother is to feel like a mother. When you have a newborn, much of the parental relationship is predicated on acts: Making decisions for your baby (How will you feed them? Who will you invite to meet them?) and performing the care that they need: Feeding, holding, clothing, helping them sleep, changing their diaper. Even making eye contact. There is not a single item on that list that was in my control. It is nearly impossible to act like a mother-to feel like a parent-in the NICU without an open and reciprocal relationship with a nurse, who can share her or his ways of knowing, and make it clear that you are important in this strange new world, as a parent and as a human being. When nurses do this for families, it is powerful almost beyond words. It's the reason people write to me to tell me about a nurse who cared for their baby decades ago. Dr Monica McLemore has said2 that the real essence—the real magic—of nursing is not the complex skills that nurses perform. She posits instead that the essence of nursing is helping individuals, families and communities navigate and manage life transitions. The transition to parenthood is one of the most fundamental in human life. By helping with this transition, nurses not only treat the baby's physical body, but also help to heal—even help to create—the family itself. And so perhaps the most important expertise that neonatal nurses have is their way of knowing how to be in relationship with the whole family, all in the service of caring for the baby. Out of that relationship come understandings that are not only helpful for the parents but also for the nurses in providing care: This family likes to chat; this family prefers quiet; this family is having trouble affording parking; these parents had a previous premature baby who died; this father understands best if you draw a diagram; this mother does not want to breastfeed; this mother is absolutely determined to breastfeed; this mother is struggling with anxiety. This work is just as complex as any other aspect of NICU care, and none of it is separate from caring for the baby. Of course, neonatal nurses have highly specialized biomedical knowledge. This was immediately obvious to me when I saw how Mira's nurses cared for her, how they touched and tended to her, how they made decisions about what she needed that day, flagged concerns for other providers and generally seemed to keep her alive, minute by minute. This was awe-inspiring not in a greeting-card way, but in the way that it feels to watch experts in the most extreme environments-like watching a floating astronaut fix part of the space station. But what else did our nurses know? They knew that the next several months in intensive care would mean that we were in a relationship with each other: me, my husband Amol, my daughter Mira, and her nurses. We were all engaged in this care process together, though I didn't understand it that way at the time. In fact, if you had asked me what the NICU was about, I would have said technology, life support; I would not have said it was a place of relationship. I could not imagine how I could build a relationship with anyone—let alone my newborn daughter—in a place like this. Developmental psychologist Dr Heidelise Als, who pioneered the idea of developmental care, described this3 so aptly. \"Intuitive parenting for the full-term baby is regulated by evolution,\" she explained. \"There are exceptions but it works in the majority of cases. For preemies, we need to be more aware and attuned so that we understand the baby.\" In other words, premature babies are communicating, but not in the way that parents have evolved to expect. We need nurses and other neonatal providers to help us translate. As Als explained, and as I experienced, when parents don't know how to read their own baby's cues, they can feel incompetent, or even, on some level, betrayed, which can lead to guilt and shame. This is where that therapeutic relationship comes in: Nurses often know how to read premature babies, and they know how to communicate with the babies in turn. When nurses share this knowledge with families, it is a decoder ring that lets parents enter the world in which things can make sense. There is so much data that suggests that simple parental presence, parental feeding and kangaroo care, is instrumental in the healthy development of babies in the NICU. But many parents don't know that at first, and it can be near impossible to feel important in the NICU. It is even more difficult for parents from marginalized groups: Parents of color who face racism in and out of medical settings; LGBTQ families; families who don't speak English; families who can't afford to take leave. Nurses can be the ones who help us understand our own importance, to help us do what we can, and to understand our right to act as parents, even in intensive care. Our regular weekend nurse, Kavita, always started her assessments by just watching Mira; she would stand very still and examine her for many minutes at a time. By watching Kavita watch Mira, I came to understand that there really was a baby—my baby—underneath all the technology keeping her alive. And if Kavita, with all her knowledge, needed to observe Mira to understand her condition that day, I could do that too. Kavita chatted with me about Mira; she talked about my daughter as a person, with particular needs and characteristics and strengths. For me, Kavita's approach helped me see NICU care as deeply human, reliant on insight that came from close attention to other people. When nurses helped me understand how to take care of Mira, they were also helping me understand myself as her mother. When I held Mira against my bare chest in kangaroo care, I learned not to stroke, but to make my hands firm, still and containing, like the muscular walls of a uterus. She relaxed against me, and I felt she recognized me. I learned to keep my voice low. And I tried—never quite succeeding—to watch my baby, not the monitor, as all the nurses said. Once, Mira's blood oxygen percentage plummeted to 77, and the alarm sounded, increasingly shrill. I looked at the monitor (not at the baby!) and leapt up to find our nurse. I turned around to see her already there, her eyes on Mira's face, which was pinkish. The nurse was unconcerned: \"If her saturations were really in the 70s, her skin wouldn't be pink.\" This nurse explained to me how to watch Mira's color, especially around her lips-Mira was more reliable than the monitor. The technology was prone to errors, and sometimes close attention to human details was the best way of knowing. I saw, when Mira had real apneas and bradycardias, how her skin went dusky, gray-blue. In later years, many times, I comforted myself with the distinct pinkness of her lower lip. Or, a few times, a dusky cast sent us straight to the hospital. I needed that knowledge to be Mira's mother. This is not to say that these relationships functioned perfectly: Afraid that something terrible could happen, I deferred to the nurses in Mira's care more often than was probably healthy. One morning about a week before Mira came home, when she had graduated to an open-topped bassinet and was on room air, I asked our nurse, whom I didn't know well, if I could do kangaroo care. She looked at me for a minute and said, \"She's your baby! You don't have to ask for permission to pick her up.\" I was sincerely shocked: I really had thought I needed to ask for permission, and I had never picked her up on my own before. And again, this made me wonder: What kind of mother was I? I had never once cupped the back of my daughter's head and neck and lifted her to my body. I was afraid I would hurt her. So I asked for help—I was good at asking for help by then—and the nurse showed me how. No one wants to become a parent in the NICU. In retrospect, I learned some hard truths more quickly than I would have liked—but these truths reveal themselves to every parent eventually. I couldn't protect her from pain; I couldn't know her future. But also, and more importantly: I couldn't do it alone. The reality is that no one can do it alone, and no one should have to try. It is such a cliché to say that raising a child takes a village, but when you have a premature baby that reality is unmissable from the very beginning. Without our nurses, Mira and I and Amol would not be the family that we are now. The nurse–parent relationship can be a locus of power, knowledge and compassion for all parties, and to me, there's nothing more beautiful, more full of promise and potential, more worth protecting, in all of health care. –Sarah DiGregorio, MA Independent Journalist",

    "abstract": "In 2022, for the first time in 20 years, infant mortality increased by 3%.1 Infant mortality continues to vary by race, with non-Hispanic Black neonates affected disproportionately.2,3 Non-Hispanic Black infants have the highest mortality rate at 10.62/1000 live births. The infant mortality rates for Hispanic (5.03/1000 live births), non-Hispanic White (4.49/1000 live births), and non-Hispanic Asian (3.38/1000 live births) infants are less than half.3 Sixty-six percent of infant deaths occur in infants less than 37 weeks' gestation.3 Additionally, disorders related to short gestation and low birth weight are the leading causes of death for non-Hispanic Black (237/1000 live births) and non-Hispanic Asian (75/1000 live births) infants.3 Racism and implicit bias persist in health care. Racism is a social system that consciously regards certain racial groups as inferior.4 On the other hand, implicit bias refers to an unconscious judgment against an individual or group of individuals based on personal experiences or perceptions of a particular group or culture.5 Implicit bias may be unintentional and typically goes unnoticed by healthcare workers; however, it may be painfully obvious to patients and their families. Implicit bias can threaten the care that is provided to our patients, and have a negative effect on the patient-provider relationship. This practice can lead inconsistent care, placing the patient's life at risk. Microaggressions are everyday verbal or nonverbal comments, questions, looks, or body language that communicate derogatory, hostile, or negative messages toward a specific individual or group based strictly on their marginalized group membership. Microaggressions are a form of implicit bias and include statements often heard in the NICU such as \"Wimpy White Boy\" and \"Strong Black Female.\" Unfortunately, these inappropriate labels have become part of the NICU culture. While these comments are not meant to cause harm or be taken negatively, they may cause great distress to the parents and families of these infants. A provider may even consider the phrase \"Strong Black Female\" to have a positive connotation. As health care providers to neonatal patients, it is important to always include families in concert with the care and wellbeing of the infant. As such, families are our patients too. Phrases such as these do not instill confidence in parents that Black infants will be monitored as closely as infants who are White. With the mindset of \"She is a strong Black female; she will do fine\", a provider may overlook the very subtle signs that neonates exhibit when their systems are trying to compensate during the early period of clinical instability. Instead of verbalizing how well Black female neonates do, race needs to be taken out of the discussion and consideration needs to be given to the infant's gestation and disease processes that are common during that time. On the other end of the spectrum, a provider may overlook clinical manifestations pointing to other diagnoses because they are blinded by the \"Wimpy White Boy\" mindset. Again, the infant's gestation needs to be kept in mind and alternative differential diagnoses need to be considered without taking race into account. Clinical vigilance should be equal in all our neonatal patients. Inappropriate labeling in the NICU is rampant, unnecessary, and harmful. By bringing this awareness to everyone, we can help in the delivery of all-inclusive care without bias and racism. The terms \"Wimpy White Boy\" and \"Strong Black Female\" may seem harmless but can have devastating effects on our neonatal patients and their families. Eradicating these inappropriate labels brings us one step closer to equality in healthcare quality and access. —Desi M Newberry, DNP, NNP-BC; Anjavi Sharma, BSN, RN, and Amanda Williams, BSN, RN Duke University School of Nursing, Durham, NC —Tracey Bell, DNP, NNP-BC University of Pittsburgh School of Nursing, Pittsburgh, PA",

Purpose: To evaluate the use of an umbilical line securement bundle to reduce unintended line discontinuation after line adjustment in the neonate at a single 40-bed Level IV neonatal intensive care unit. Methods: A pre-post design of 75 neonates, preimplementation (n = 50) and postimplementation (n = 25), was analyzed using data collection from the electronic health record. Results: There was a 37.5% absolute reduction in removal of the umbilical line due to malposition after line adjustment utilizing the umbilical line bundle, standardizing the adjustment order, nursing process, and follow-up x-ray evaluation. This absolute reduction has clinical significance although not statistically significant. Provider compliance rates with line adjustment order bundle were 75%, decreasing with additional adjustments (50%). Nursing staff reported comfort with umbilical line management, ranging from 63% to 87% on different tasks. Implications for Practice: The use of umbilical line bundles reduces rates of line discontinuation due to malposition. The adoption of umbilical line bundles in neonatal intensive care unit practice may help to prevent unintended line discontinuation. Implications for Research: There is a need for continued research regarding the use of secondary securement devices for decreased rate of malposition and the timing and methods for surveillance of umbilical line position.",

    "abstract": "Background: Feeding skill acquisition is commonly a limiting factor determining when an infant born prematurely can be discharged. Purpose: This study aimed to determine if the addition of a novel feeding progression algorithm (combination of objective data from a suck measurement device and slow flow/low variability nipples) to current neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) standards could decrease feeding-related length of stay (primary outcome). We hypothesized that by timing the initiation of oral feedings to coincide with adequate sensory-motor skill development, feeding-related length of stay may be decreased. Methods: This was a prospective intervention study, with a historical control cohort, of infants born less than 30 weeks’ gestational age without comorbidities affecting feeding skill acquisition at a Regional Level III-S NICU at a women and infant’s hospital in Louisiana. A novel feeding progression algorithm utilized objective assessment of sucking to determine progression in nipple flow rates with slow flow/low variability nipples (flow rates from 0 to 9 mL/min) for infants receiving intervention (n = 18). Thirty-six controls who did not receive the feeding progression algorithm were identified via electronic medical record retrospective chart review. Results: Eighteen completed the study. Compared to the control group, infants receiving feeding interventions had delayed sequencing initiation, extended time between initially off positive pressure ventilation and initiation of sequencing, and decreased feeding-related length of stay, with similar total length of stay. Implications for Practice and Research: This study adds to existing research supporting the effectiveness of novel feeding progression algorithms and interventions to support the health and outcomes of infants born prematurely. Future research should focus on implementation studies for feeding progression algorithm integration into standard NICU care.",

    "abstract": "Background and Significance: In neonatal intensive care, the communication of difficult news can have lingering repercussions throughout the lives of those receiving such information. Uncertainty and stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively influence this sensitive yet essential communication process. Purpose: To analyze the communication of difficult news during the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of parents of newborns admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit. Methods: A qualitative, descriptive research study was completed in a hospital in Brazil. Individual and semistructured interviews were conducted with 21 parents of newborns hospitalized in an intensive care unit and submitted to thematic analysis. Results: Three themes were built: “Tools and strategies to manage difficult news,” “What makes difficult news hard to listen,” and “The importance of being prepared to receive difficult news.” When comparing these findings with prepandemic literature, the COVID-19 period changed communication dynamics, including coping tools and altered family dynamics. Additionally, assessing healthcare providers’ positive and negative behaviors by parents could clarify essential skills to support the family’s hospitalization process during a crisis. Implications for Practice and Research: Applying and investing in skills training such as spirituality assessment, providing clear and straightforward information, and empathy can reduce the impact of difficult news and, thus, requires both recognition and action from healthcare professionals. Knowing some of the effects COVID-19 had on the communication process for parents with critically ill infants, healthcare providers can better prepare themselves for communication in several scenarios and establish successful interactions.",

    "abstract": "Background: More than 350,000 U.S. infants are admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) annually and likely experience discomfort. Although nurse perceptions of infant symptoms, suffering, and quality of life (QOL) are valuable, the availability of standardized assessment tools to measure these concepts are limited. Purpose: To provide preliminary evidence of the internal structure, reliability, and validity of the Nurse Perception of Infant Condition (NPIC) scale. Methods: Infants were enrolled from a Level IV NICU in the U.S. Midwest. Nurses reported on their perceptions of the infant symptom experience and their expectations for infant survival. Weekly behavioral observations of infants were obtained before and after standard delivery of care to obtain a comfort score. Results: 237 nurses who cared for 73 infants completed 569 surveys over 28 months. All NPIC items were significantly correlated with each other ( P &lt; .001). Factor analysis revealed strong evidence of a 2-factor structure (survival and suffering subscales). Both subscales demonstrated good to excellent internal consistency. Together the 2 factors explained 82% of the variability in the scale responses. Limited validity evidence was found. Implications for Practice and Research: Evidence was found to support the internal structure and reliability of the NPIC scale. However, further item development and refinement is needed to increase the utility NPIC scale in clinical and research settings. The development of improved assessments of the infant NICU experience is warranted. Nurse perceptions of infant suffering or poor QOL may have implications for their expectations for infant survival and possibly care delivery.",

    "abstract": "Background: Rates of severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) continue to rise globally despite advances in healthcare. Differences in practices related to optimizing oxygenation is among key factors that increase the risk of severe ROP. A recent increase in severe ROP rates at 2 local neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) prompted further investigation into potential preventative practices. Purpose: The project team’s goal was to reduce rates of severe ROP by 20% in the 2 participating units. Methods: A level IV and level III NICU were targeted, including 255 infants at risk for ROP. Interventions included staff education, implementation of new established oxygen guidelines, as well as use of order sets, and alarm limits. Compliance rates and severe ROP rates before and after new guideline implementation were assessed. Results: After implementing the new guidelines, average alarm limit compliance met project goals of 90% at both sites. Severe ROP rates declined from 10% to 7% in the level IV NICU site and from 6% to 0% in the level III NICU site during the 24-month study period from 2022 to 2023. Implications for practice and research: Education and increased understanding regarding risk factors for ROP patients are crucial to successfully implementing and sustaining standardized oxygenation guidelines. Including the entire healthcare team and patient families is key to successful QI initiatives and improving patient outcomes. Further research is needed for optimal standardized oxygen alarm limits for this patient population. Video Abstract: One of the leading causes of childhood blindness is retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). 1 ROP is a disease of the retina that affects premature infants, with the highest risk to very low birthweight (VLBW) infants born with a gestational age of less than 30 to 32 weeks or infants weighing less than 1500 grams. 2 There are 5 stages of ROP. Stages 1 and 2 are considered mild and resolve on their own. Stage 3 is considered moderate-severe and sometimes resolves independently, with many cases requiring treatment. Stages 4 and 5 ROP are deemed severe and require treatment.",

To (1) examine the feasibility of the study protocol; (2) describe early life stress, DNA methylation of NR3C1 and HSD11B2 , and PO skill development; and (3) explore the association between DNA methylation of NR3C1 and HSD11B2 and infant characteristics, early life stress, and PO skill development. We employed a longitudinal descriptive pilot study (N = 10). Infant characteristics were collected from the infant's electronic medical record. Early life stress was assessed via the modified Neonatal Infant Stressor Scale. DNA methylation of NR3C1 exon 1F and HSD11B2 promoter regions was analyzed from the infant's buccal samples. PO skill development was evaluated using the Early Feeding Skills Assessment. Infants who experienced more acute and chronic stress during their neonatal intensive care unit hospitalization demonstrated higher DNA methylation at CpG 17 and 31 of the NR3C1 exon 1F and at CpG 4 and 28 of the HSD11B2 promoter regions. Infants with higher DNA methylation at these CpG sites also exhibited less optimal PO skill development and experienced longer transition from first to full PO. Our findings revealed relationships among early life stress, DNA methylation of NR3C1 and HSD11B2 , and PO skill development in preterm infants.

    "abstract": "Background: Interventions aimed at improving parental understanding of preterm infants' behavioral signs have drawn increased attention in recent years. However, there are limited data regarding parents' actual perceptions of infants' behavior during parent–infant interactions while infants are in a light-sleep state. Purposes: (1) To describe parental perceptions of infants' behavior at 33 to 35 weeks' corrected age during light-sleep and (2) to identify changes in parental perceptions of preterm infants' behavior over time. Methods: This study used a qualitative, longitudinal design based on observations and interviews. Three sets of parents and their infants born between 29 and 30 weeks' gestational age were observed up to 3 times during light sleep states when the infants were 33 to 35 weeks' corrected age. Parents were interviewed regarding their perceptions of infant behavior/growth once at the time of observation and once more within 2 weeks of the final observation. The findings are based on the observation of parents' perception-driven interactions with infants. Results: Four themes emerged describing the transition of parental perception that progresses to gain a better understanding of their infant's behavior through repeated interaction. Implications for Practice: The findings of this study inform caregivers in neonatal intensive care units regarding the unique experience of parent–infant dyads. This knowledge can help promote family-centered developmental care efforts in neonatal intensive care units. Implications for Research: Further research should focus on studying a larger sample group to confirm the findings and refining strategies to incorporate the findings to enhance neonatal intensive care unit care.",

    "abstract": "Background: Procalcitonin (PCT) use is not widespread in the neonatal population during late-onset sepsis evaluations. Minimal data exist on appropriate PCT cutoff levels to treat with antibiotics for neonatal sepsis. New guidelines were implemented in select central Texas neonatal intensive care units for late-onset sepsis (infants older than 72 hours) with recommended PCT cutoff levels for antibiotic administration. Purpose: To evaluate antibiotic usage in a local neonatal population following late-onset sepsis workups pre-/postimplementation of a PCT guideline. Methods: A retrospective pre–/post–quality improvement project using chart review data was performed over 11 months in 2018. Inclusion criteria were infants older than 72 hours of life having a late-onset sepsis workup. The outcome measure is appropriate antibiotic administration, based on laboratory test results or cultures, for infants pre-/post-PCT guidelines. Results: The χ 2 test indicated that the proportion of infants receiving appropriate antibiotics pre-/postinitiation of PCT guidelines did not significantly differ. There is, however, clinical significance with an improvement in the proportion of appropriate antibiotic administration and a decrease in variability. Implications for Practice: Using PCT may help the practitioner identify sepsis earlier and more effectively, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality among neonates while improving antibiotic stewardship. Implications for Research: The small sample size in this study and the limited number of neonatal intensive care units limit any inferences. Future research should evaluate the use of PCT in a larger sample across multiple settings.",

    "abstract": "CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019: THE PREGNANT WOMAN, NEWBORN, AND RISK OF VERTICAL TRANSMISSION Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and is a member of the Coronavirus family. Other members of the Coronavirus family include MERS-CoV, responsible for Middle East respiratory syndrome, and SARS-CoV, responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome. Corona viruses occur in both humans and animal species including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.1 Animal coronaviruses can infect people with subsequent person-to-person transmission.1 Person-to-person contact occurs through close contact with infected individuals (within 6 ft) and through respiratory droplets from sneezing or coughing.1 Although not believed to be the main route of exposure, spread from contact with infected surfaces may be possible.1 It is not known how long the virus can live without a host. Symptoms of COVID-19 may appear between 2 and 14 days after exposure and can include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.1 Symptoms can range from mild to severe illness and death.1 The current COVID-19 outbreak began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, with a link to a seafood and live animal market (suggesting animal-to-person spread).1 Person-to-person spread has since occurred in other countries, including the United States.1 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.2,3 A pandemic is a global outbreak with rapid spread due to no preexisting immunity to the virus.3 The number of cases and deaths from COVID-19 is not reported here as the numbers are changing rapidly. The WHO and the CDC update the number of cases and deaths from COVID-19 daily and can be accessed via https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/20200312-sitrep-52-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=e2bfc9c0_2 and https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html, respectively.4,5 Currently, there is a paucity of literature on the effects of COVID-19 on pregnant women and neonates and the risk for vertical transmission (via placenta or human milk). It is not currently known whether pregnant women are more susceptible to COVID-19 than other adults. The relative immunologic deficiencies that occur during pregnancy may make pregnant women more susceptible to COVID-19, but this has not been confirmed at this time. In the past, pregnant women were at a higher risk for severe illness, morbidity, and mortality with other similar coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and with both the influenza and H1N1 viruses.6 A retrospective review of medical records of 9 pregnant women who developed COVID-19 pneumonia during the third trimester in Wuhan, China, showed similar symptomatology with nonpregnant adult patients, including fever (n = 7), cough (n = 4), myalgia (n = 3), sore throat (n = 2), and malaise (n = 2).7 Five of the women had lymphocytopenia and 3 had increased aminotransferase concentrations. None of the 9 women developed severe disease or died. These findings must be interpreted with caution, as the possibility remains that COVID-19 could follow a similar, more severe disease progression as SARS and MERS in pregnant women. In the same review, fetal distress was noted in 2 cases. The 9 neonates were born via cesarean section (for rationales other than COVID-19 infection), with all exhibiting 1-minute Apgar scores of 8 to 9 and 5-minute Apgar scores of 9 to 10. No neonatal asphyxia was observed. All samples from amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swabs, and human milk were negative for SARS-CoV-2, indicating no evidence of vertical transmission in women who developed COVID-19 pneumonia in the third trimester.7 Liu et al8 and Zhu et al9 also showed no evidence for vertical transmission in their retrospective reviews on 3 and 9 pregnant women, respectively, with COVID-19 pneumonia. Liu et al8 found all negative results for SARS-CoV-2 in neonatal oropharyngeal swabs, umbilical cord blood, and neonatal serum (n = 3). Zhu et al9 tested 9 neonates via nasopharyngeal swab, and all were negative for SARS-CoV-2. However, we must remain vigilant due to the small sample size of these studies. All 3 of the aforementioned studies involved pregnant women who became infected with COVID-19 in the third trimester. Questions remain as to the possibility of vertical transmission or fetal harm with maternal infection in the first or second trimester. In contrast to the aforementioned studies, there is a case report of a neonate with a positive nucleic acid test for COVID-19 at 30 hours of life, making vertical transmission a possibility.10 The mother of the neonate presented with COVID-19 pneumonia. The neonate exhibited shortness of breath, evidence of pulmonary infection, and slightly abnormal liver function tests. The neonate did not exhibit fever or cough and vital signs were stable.10 Of note, this information was obtained from a news brief, was not peer-reviewed and had to be translated from Chinese to English via Google Translate. A second report of a newborn who tested positive for COVID-19 has surfaced from London; the source a British tabloid.11 More recently, Zeng et al12 reviewed the medical records of 33 neonates born to COVID-19 positive mothers. Three of the neonates tested positive for COVID-19 via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on day of life (DOL) #2. Vertical transmission may have occurred in these cases but it is difficult to interpret because the neonates were not tested until DOL#2. The aforementioned studies utilized RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 testing in all samples. In February of this year Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 became available. One case study and one retrospective analysis have since described the use of IgG and IgM antibody testing and have raised the possibility of in-utero transmission of COVID-19.13,14 Dong et al13 describe a case study of an infected pregnant woman with positive RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swab at 34 weeks and 2 days gestation. At 37 weeks 5 days she had elevated serum IgG and IgM antibodies, however, PT-PCR of vaginal secretions was negative. She delivered via cesarean section at 37 weeks 6 days with an N95 mask on. The neonate was isolated in the NICU immediately after birth. The neonate was asymptomatic with Apgars of 9 and 10. At 2 hours of life the neonate had elevated SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies, elevated cytokines and an elevated WBC. The RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swab was negative for a total of 5 tests performed at 2 hours of life through DOL #16. Limitations of this study include that it is a single case study and there was no testing of amniotic fluid or the placenta. Zeng et al14 performed a retrospective analysis of 6 pregnant women with symptomatic COVID-19 pneumonia and positive RT-PCR testing. All of the women delivered via cesarean section, wearing a mask, in a negative pressure room. The neonates were all isolated immediately after birth. All 6 neonates had Apgar scores of 8 to 9 and 9 to 10 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. All 6 neonates had negative RT-PCR (via nasopharyngeal swab) results but evidence of both IgG and IgM antibodies in their serum. Two of the neonates had elevated levels of both IgG and IgM antibodies. IgM antibodies are not transferred to the fetus from the placenta; therefore, the presence of IgM by 2 hours of life in some of these infants suggests in utero infection.13,14 Additionally, IgM usually does not appear until 3 to 7 days after infection; making infection after delivery unlikely.13 The clinical significance of this is unknown. The three neonates with elevated IgM antibodies presented by Dong et al13 and Zeng et al14 were all asymptomatic. Currently, more data is available to describe the epidemiology in older infants and children than in neonates. Wei et al15 showed no severe illness in a small retrospective study with 9 infants (aged 28 days to 1 year) diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. Two of the infants presented with mild URI, 4 with fever, 1 had no symptoms, and no information was available on the remaining 2 infants. None of the infants required mechanical ventilation or intensive care, and there were no reported deaths. All 9 infants had an infected family member. Seven of the infants lived in Wuhan or had contact with someone who had been there recently, one had no direct linkage to Wuhan, and there was no information available for the remaining infant. This study is promising for good infant prognosis with COVID-19 infection but is too small to officially determine overall expected prognosis for infants, especially infants with comorbidities such as prematurity or congenital heart disease. Other non–COVID-19 viral infections are known to have more severe effects on younger children, those with pulmonary comorbidities, and those who are immunocompromised.16 In addition, the overall numbers for infant COVID-19 infection may be underestimated because of underdiagnosis with milder symptomatology.15 A retrospective, epidemiological analysis of 2143 pediatric patients with either laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection or suspected cases in mainland China found infants to be at a higher risk for severe or critical illness than older children.17 In total, 10.6% of infants (aged 0-1 year) developed severe or critical illness compared with 7.3%, 4.2%, 4.1%, and 3% of children aged 1 to 5 years, 6 to 10 years, 11 to 15 years, and older than 15 years, respectively. A limitation of this study is that some of the suspected cases could have been caused by a different respiratory virus. Other non–COVID-19 infections are associated with more severe outcomes in younger children as well.16 Breast milk provides the best immunologic protection for neonates. Although there is currently no evidence to support the transmission of COVID-19 through breast milk, the available evidence is limited. Recognizing that breast milk provides the best source of nutrition, the WHO, CDC, American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine provide guidelines for women with confirmed COVID-19 infection who wish to breast feed.18,19,20,21 These guidelines include taking precautions to decrease the risk of transmission through strict handwashing before touching the baby, breast pump or bottles and wearing a face mask during breast feeding. Breast pumps and bottles should be cleaned thoroughly using manufacturer's instructions. The AAP recommends considering temporary separation of COVID-19 positive mothers and their neonates.20 In this case, expressed breast milk can be fed by another healthy individual.19,20 A priority must be placed on handwashing, cough etiquette, and effective infection control practices to stop the spread of COVID-19. Infection control measures outlined by the CDC include strategies for minimizing the chance for exposures, adhering to standard, contact and airborne precautions, managing visitor access, implementing engineering controls, monitoring and managing exposed healthcare personnel, training and education of healthcare personnel, implementing environmental infection control, and reporting within healthcare facilities and to public health authorities. This report can be accessed at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control/control-recommendations.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fhcp%2Finfection-control.html.22 Many questions remain due to the relative newness of the COVID-19 epidemic. It remains unclear as to whether pregnant women and neonates are at an increased risk for negative sequelae due to COVID-19 infection. The risk for vertical transmission remains unclear but may be possible. Children may exhibit a milder disease course and progression than adults, however; neonates may be more vulnerable, especially those with comorbidities such as prematurity. This is not well-defined, due to small numbers of neonates affected to date. As nursing professionals, we must educate parents and visitors in the neonatal intensive care unit and remain vigilant in our infection control practices.",

We hope you will learn from our past and look to our future through her thoughtful words. Debra Brandon, PhD, RN, CCNS, FAAN Co-Editor; Advances in Neonatal Care [email protected] Jacqueline M. McGrath, PhD, RN, FNAP, FAAN Co-Editor; Advances in Neonatal Care [email protected] Guest Editorial Advances in Neonatal Care:20 Years, 1445 Manuscripts, and Countless Nurses Touched and Infants Impacted! Madge E. Buus-Frank, DNP, APRN-BC, FAAN As the Founding Editor-in-Chief of Advances in Neonatal Care (ANC), I am honored to be invited by Drs Debra Brandon and Jacqueline McGrath to write the first in a series of guest editorials celebrating the 20-year anniversary of the journal's launch. Many of you may not know that this journal was “conceived” during the Presidency of our visionary leader Dr Carole Kenner, and we gave “birth” during the term of the National Association of Neonatal Nurses (NANN) President Dr Frances Strodtbeck. We were given 9 short months to ensure that NANN members achieved the benefits of full business ownership of their professional journal and that they would continue to have access to the best-quality evidence required to serve our patients with increasingly complex healthcare needs. The 2001 inaugural editorial1 reflected on the exponential growth of knowledge in healthcare and the very real risk of obsolescence for nurses who were not actively engaged in a community of practice (CoP) that fosters robust lifelong learning.2 Our hope was to create this CoP for neonatal nursing led by our professional society NANN and facilitated by a publication that would “live, breath, and invigorate nursing practice with the knowledge needed to survive and thrive in the decades to come.” Twenty years later the idea of CoPs distributed knowledge and lifelong learning are even more critical. In the 1950s, the “doubling of medical knowledge” took 50 years, by 1980 knowledge doubled in 7 years, by 2010 the doubling had accelerated to 3.5 years and in 2020 the doubling of knowledge is expected to occur every 73 days.3 The threat of obsolescence is omnipresent as the pace of knowledge expands at an unprecedented pace and begs the original question posed in my first editorial, “How will nurses practice, learn, and innovate in order to create our preferred future?” MISSION, VISION, AND VALUES With these ideas in the forefront of our planning, the journal's stated mission was “to advance the art and science of newborn care through the publication of scientifically sound and clinically relevant articles that would enhance interdisciplinary care.”1 The talented Editorial Board, for which we should all be grateful, knew that member engagement in the design and delivery of this publication was the key ingredient to help ANC move from being “just another journal collecting dust on a lonely library shelf to a transformational learning tool.” Our stated goals were to broaden your knowledge base, enhance critical thinking, infuse a healthy dose of evidence, and challenge your thinking.1 The journal was and remains quite novel in its approach by incorporating video content, evidence-based reviews, and research tutorials to build capacity in the CoP. From the outset, we embraced rigorous publication and conflict-of-interest standards from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, emphasizing editorial independence and avoiding undue commercial influence.4 Unlike many nursing journals of the time, we chose to elevate the quality and rigor of the journal by adopting the Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials (Consort Statement),5 and the Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence (SQUIRE statement).6Advances in Neonatal Care was quickly recognized by Index Medicus, a lofty achievement for a 2-year-old nursing journal. This ensured that ANC content would be indexed in PubMed and retrievable to clinicians and scholars around the world. The standards of the journal were embraced and further elevated7 by the visionary Editors who followed my tenure and who incorporated nationally recognized standards for case reports (CARE),8 evidence-based practice educational interventions (GREET),9 and papers categorized as review of the literature or meta-analysis that are guided by the Preferred Reporting Guidelines for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) standards.10 In 2020, the journal continues to elevate practice for the entire neonatal care community demonstrating a consistently rising Impact Factor (1.244 in 2018). The vision of impacting neonatal care worldwide has evolved from an aspirational goal to a reality given that ANC now: Circulates in 55 countries; Is readily accessed via Ovid with 140,607 views per year; Drives robust Web site traffic and online presence with a record 283,089 page views and 423,696 exposures per year; and Has published 1445 manuscripts from 2001 to 2020. The Co-Editors and their committed Editorial Board continue the tradition of mentoring novice authors despite the fact that they now receive 180 to 200 manuscript submissions per year.11 Anniversaries provide us with both the impetus and the rare opportunity to pause and reflect on the incredible advances that have transpired since the launch of the journal just 20 short years ago. In the words of William Pollard, “Learning and innovation go hand in hand. The arrogance of success is to think that what you did yesterday will be sufficient for tomorrow.” Given this, I take the editorialists prerogative, highlighting key lessons from the past 20 years that may help us chart our course in 2020 and beyond. LESSON 1: IMPROVING NEONATAL OUTCOMES IS CLEARLY POSSIBLE In 2001 ANC was launched as neonatal care came of age in the post–surfactant “bubble.” Unfortunately, after the introduction of surfactant improvements in mortality plateaued.12 We were increasingly aware of developmental stressors of the newborn intensive care units (NICU) environment and the mismatch between this environment and the needs of more fetal infants.13,14 During that time we also grappled with the wide variation in neonatal outcomes among and between NICUs and the high costs associated with NICU care.15,16 Caregivers, burdened by the harsh reality of the difficult ethical decisions NICU families face as we “saved” increasing numbers of infants on the border of viability, were influenced by a landmark cinéma vérité film, called Dreams and Dilemmas, produced by Dr George Little from Dartmouth.17 Our Canadian colleagues published important articles focused on key morbidities (chronic lung disease, late-onset infection, necrotizing enterocolitis [NEC], intraventricular hemorrhage, and retinopathy of prematurity) and the toll these conditions placed on NICU graduates and their families,18 their quality of life,19 and their use of health services.20 This work amplified the need for more robust follow-up data and clearly demonstrated that families and siblings were impacted up to 20 years after discharge.21,22 Knowing the long-term impact of our care highlighted the need to further improve infant and family outcomes. One result of this knowledge was a collective focus by the neonatal community on implementation science; that is, implementing practices that we know make a difference and focusing on measurable improvements using quality improvement methods.23 Our collective progress was reported in a landmark JAMA Pediatrics article using data from 756 US NICUs.24 These data suggest that in the United States from 2005 to 2014, rates of death prior to discharge and serious lifetime morbidities decreased significantly. Within those 8 years 75% of NICUs achieved performance rates equivalent to the 2005 “best quartile benchmarks” for all outcomes except chronic lung disease. This observational study revealed the magnitude and remarkable pace of improvement in neonatal care using robust risk-adjusted clinical outcomes; however, it was not designed to explain how and why such improvements were achieved. During this same time period many neonatal teams, often fueled by the work of diligent nurses, were engaged in local, state, and national quality improvement efforts. These efforts sometimes revisited the basics of infection prevention (ie, an emphasis on handwashing)25 and promoted uptake of evidence-based practice. Nurses built and often led central line teams and tested and refined standardized line placement and maintenance bundles to ensure high-reliability care.26–28 Probably, one of the most important developments was a culture shift away from the mind-set that “every infant gets infected” to one of zero or near-zero tolerance for these preventable hospital-acquired infections.29 Teams across the United States focused on reducing retinopathy of prematurity and safe use of oxygen, by optimizing saturation targets, increasing awareness at the bedside, and minimizing alarm fatigue both in individual and multicenter quality improvement interventions.30–32 An increasing emphasis on nutrition became more prominent on the neonatal research agenda. The evolving evidence helped us move away from prolonged periods of fasting to ward off NEC, resulting in a catabolic state of unintended starvation; early total parenteral nutrition and subnutritional trophic feedings were introduced into practice.33 During the past 2 decades, human milk science has blossomed and NICUs have begun to systematically adopt preferential use of mother's own milk. Human milk coupled with standardized feeding regimens34 is associated with important reductions in NEC and has now become a well-established standard of care,35 demonstrating both improved outcomes and cost savings.36,37 On the brain front large randomized controlled trials demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of cooling in infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.38 And, in the last decade, nurses and nurse practitioners in leadership roles have collaborated with their neonatology and neurology physician partners to launch and refine highly specialized newborn units that provide advanced neurointensive care as well as specialized units and care teams focused on caring for the most vulnerable micro-premature infants; both have demonstrated early but promising measurable improvement in the quality, safety, and value of care.39,40 Beyond the usual mortality and morbidity challenges neonatal caregivers in many regions of the country have been struck as if by lightening by a new epidemic of substance use in pregnancy. Mothers and their infants have been dually impacted and NICUs are burgeoning with actively withdrawing infants. National multicenter quality improvement collaborative work commenced and partnerships with many states have been forged. Through a host of potentially better practices, mothers and infants were reunited. The care emphasis shifted to nurturing the mother and ensuring her comprehensive treatment and ability to support the infant. Standardized bundles of care ensured timely and safe discharge of infants home, with important decreases in length of stay, decreased need for (days exposed to) pharmacologic treatment, and decreases in cost.41,42 A second national epidemic emerged and the “Choosing Wisely” initiative focused on antibiotic overuse and misuse given 40-fold variations in NICU antibiotic use.43 Thereafter, a multicenter collaborative in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) demonstrated a 34% relative risk reduction in antibiotic use in 146 US NICUs and improved compliance with the CDC core elements of antibiotic stewardship.44 As the famous song denotes, “we've only just begun” the improvement journey. Unfortunately, many NICUs lag behind, perhaps unaware of the tremendous results of the larger CoP. And despite a myriad of successes it is sobering to acknowledge that variation in outcomes persist across virtually every published international data registry and comparative data set.45–59 This well-documented, persistent, and likely unwarranted variation in outcomes suggests that there is still much more room for orchestrated improvement! LESSON 2: NURSES MUST REFUSE TO REMAIN INVISIBLE We should take great pride and collectively celebrate many of the achievements of the past 20 years. The role of the neonatal nurse and the nurse practitioner has grown in scope and influence,59 and the number of doctorally prepared nurses nationally, and in our own neonatal community, has also grown dramatically. Given the collegiality and teamwork we experience at the bedside, it is disappointing that recently published chronicles of progress in neonatology still frequently neglect to mention many of the critical contributions of neonatal nursing.61,62 We must be ever mindful that nurses not be relegated to the sidelines serving as the “invisible labor” in improvement science, notably absent or underrepresented in conference presentations, publications, and panels. It is equally regretful that in 2020 nurses are still often working on improvement “passion” projects on their days off, suggesting that we have yet to achieve full organizational respect and support. Although this level of professionalism is commendable, it is unlikely to sustain improvement efforts in the future. We must ensure that, both now and in the future, nurses have a full seat at the table and that nurses and every NICU team member have open access to all of the sources of relevant data to drive their research and improvement work. Nurses must be recognized as subject matter experts, researchers, implementation scientists, and faculty contributors, as well as pivotal bedside caregivers and key partners with families. Now more than ever before, nurses are uniquely prepared to lead both unit-level and system-level improvement efforts. Persistence pays off. Shirley Chisolm, the first African American woman elected to the US Congress once said, “If they don't give you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair.” One way or another, nurses, the profession that is most trusted by the public to improve the healthcare system must be present and fully accounted for!63 LESSON 3: IMPROVING OUTCOMES IS A SYNCHRONIZED TEAM SPORT Nursing education and engagement are necessary, but alone they will not be sufficient to continue to drive improved outcomes for newborns and families in the future. Those who function in teams must be educated and trained in teams in concordance with the Institute of Medicine's recommendation. No longer solely under the control of the “captain of the ship” or the leaders in the “corner office,” quality improvement is a team sport and the team (nurses, social workers, respiratory therapists, dieticians, pharmacists, physical and occupational therapists, and parents) must engage in a synchronized way to drive improvement. As Paul Batalden64 challenges us, every team member must now recognize his or her duty not just to take good care of infants today but also to improve the care for the patients of tomorrow. Furthermore, teams must be given the time and resources required to design and test improvements and to learn beyond their health system walls. Increasingly data suggest that when teams of teams come together to improve care through coordinated improvement networks, they can and will further accelerate the pace of improvement, as well as contribute to the development of more robust improvement science methods.26,27,32,41,44,64–67 LESSON 4: ADVOCATE TO CREATE INNOVATIVE AND FAMILY-LED NEWBORN INTENSIVE PARENTING UNITS (NIPU) The inclusion and evolution of the families as both essential caregivers on the healthcare team and valued improvement experts codesigning the larger system of care are another evolutionary advancement over the past 20 years.68,69 Newborn intensive care units are recognizing the critical role that parents play in their infant's recovery and as such are striving to become newborn intensive parenting units similar to those in Norway, Sweden, and beyond.69 I predict that in the not-so-distant future, we will look back at the days when parents were routinely separated from their infants at birth and were classified as “visitors” held at bay by restrictive visiting hours (an unfortunate and disempowering term) as the dark ages of neonatology. Historically, families report they were told that their infants were deemed “too sick to be held” and sometimes waited 20, 30, and 40+ days to achieve this milestone moment. Now, armed with an improved understanding of development and epigenetics, nurses are increasingly acknowledging that infants are “too sick not to be held, comforted, and nurtured by their parents!” To further reap the benefits of this paradigm shift, parents must be acknowledged as the most consistent caregiver on the child's team, and if they so desire must be increasingly present and participating in clinical rounds.70,71 In some progressive units parents are actually presenting their infant in rounds, sharing key observations about his or her status and care, and ensuring that the issues that matter most to their family are actively addressed. Parents who are working or unable to be present at this specific time of day can participate using readily available handheld technology. Discharge teaching and often associated delays could become a relic of the past when and if families have full professional and societal support to rightfully take their place at the bedside serving as continuous caregivers throughout their infant's stay. THE EVOLVING FUTURE: SHARED DECISION-MAKING AND PARENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES Given the remarkable accomplishments of the past 20 years, what lessons will we learn in the next 20 years? I believe nurses and the healthcare team will evolve into highly skilled coaches who relish their role as skilled collaborators with families. They will serve as codesigners with families of safe and effective care that is congruent with the patients' wants, needs, and preferences.72,73 Education and training in shared decision-making will be the norm—an essential skill for every NICU caregiver, with mandatory standardized universal training much akin to the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP). In partnership with and increasingly led by family advisors, we will codesign and test shared decision-making tools to enhance our everyday collaboration with parents.73 Patient registries will become more transparent and more person-centered.66,67 Learning from other disciplines, neonatology will not only collect data about our current clinical, quality, and outcome measures but also will develop a subset of valid and reliable patient/parent-reported measures to balance our quality scorecard. The power of big data will be further leveraged using artificial intelligence and advanced data visualizations into simple understandable information that is codesigned by families and providers and viewed at the bedside using interactive screens and clinical decision-making tools. These tools will increasingly allow true coproduction of care with our families. The NICU team will receive real-time feedback, provided by engaged families who respond to a brief real-time survey in much the same way consumers rate their Uber rides. Families could be asked to share their experience immediately after daily rounds, using fast and frugal instruments such as CollaboRATE, a measure of care collaboration that can help us obtain feedback on our performance in rounds by asking 3 simple questions73: How much effort was made to help you understand your infant's status? How well did the care team listen to things that matter most to you and your family? How successful were we in including you and your family in codesigning the next steps in the plan of care? These “everyday data” will be reviewed by the team who will strive to understand and improve in real-time as they iteratively test small improvements in a cycle of continuous learning. In our quest to cocreate the ideal NICU of the future parents will routinely partner with professionals to codesign both the content of care for their infant and a system of care focused on parent support during critical transitions across health settings. Beyond the hospital walls, progressive parent-led organizations such as the NEC Society will be even more fully empowered to influence the research and clinical improvement agenda as we collectively aim to contribute to their vision—“a world without NEC.” Learning from this seminal work patient advocates, researchers and clinicians come to the table using the PICORI “all-in” parent professional meeting model to create a sense of urgency and demonstrate true partnership.74 EVOLVING FUTURE: FULLY ENABLED TELEHEALTH SUPPORT BETWEEN TERTIARY AND COMMUNITY HOSPITALS AND IN THE HOME One of the most important and positive “disruptive innovations” will be the development of a broad technology-enhanced care network that provides high-level care to any infant, anytime, anywhere using tools that already exist but have yet to be fully deployed. Care in community hospitals will be enhanced by the “virtual” presence of clinical experts, now trained as skilled resuscitation coaches, ensuring the “best start” whenever possible, and potentially enabling more infants to be cared for in their community.75–76 Enabled by technology and a mind-set of healthcare without hospital walls, we will focus on potentially preventable NICU admissions and perhaps modulate some of the overuse, underuse, and misuse in our current model of NICU care.59 Care by parent units in the hospital will drive safe but earlier discharge home from the hospital. This care will be supported by technology-enhanced home environments, present even in rural “deserts” of care, with nurse healthcare coaches and consultants who are available 24/7 to support tele-home care for infants of increasing complexity.77–81 As the newly designated specialty of telehealth nursing comes of age,82 select nurses will further evolve from hands-on technicians to masterful coaches who will demonstrate improved care, lower hospital readmissions, do so at a lower cost of care, and most importantly with improved family satisfaction and empowerment. EVOLVING FUTURES: ADDRESSING THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH In healthcare our moral imperative has shifted from simply trying to “do no harm” to an increased call to action and advocacy for those who cannot speak for themselves. There is a growing socioeconomic chasm in our society at every level. Although medical care is of critical importance, likely up to 50% of health outcomes are related to critical social determinants of health, such as homelessness or unsecure, or substandard housing, food insecurity, lack of language concordant care, lack of transportation or access to care, and even basic neighborhood conditions such as air quality, access to nutritional food sources, and green space.83,84 The epidemiologic data reveal striking regional and geographic variations in care that are often best explained by the social and economic disparities. Invisible at first glance, these differences are pervasive perhaps because structural racism is so pervasive that it has contaminated the “groundwater” of our social fabric.85 We spend weeks, months, and sometimes years saving lives of vulnerable infants, only to send some of them home without the follow-through and support that will be critical to keep them alive and well beyond the hospital walls. Our preferred future of best care for every infant and family cannot be achieved until we have the courage and the collective will to look upstream at the causal factors related to prematurity and outcome disparities and to attempt to systematically address these sensitive issues.86 As black and brown infants continue to die at alarmingly accelerated rates, nurses cannot remain silent; if we do so, we are complicit in perpetuating the disparities.87 Health equity is like oxygen; invisible on the surface but lack of it is deadly nonetheless. We all know the color of and influence of money; can we continue to fail to recognize the color of health? Social justice and equitable systems of care will only be possible through collective action, and this will require a new wave of activism and moral leadership from nurses. Access to healthcare is a right for all, not a privilege for a few, and profits gained by health insurance companies that do so based upon marginalizing human health should not be tolerated.88 EVOLVING FUTURES: MOVING FROM COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE TO TRUE LEARNING HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS If we want to improve outcomes, then healthcare systems and their teams must work differently. This new way of work will require organizational learning and flexible organizational and operational infrastructures that are radically different from the status quo.89–92 We have created a “tribal survival” culture in our organizations, sometimes competing for scarce resources. To think differently and work differently we will need to reorganize our work moving away from the traditional roles and educational affiliations (departments of medicine, nursing, etc). To work differently, we must evolve—into a true learning healthcare system that transcends a single organization and leverages a technology-enhanced digital ecosystem to support our work.92 We must value and reward often forgotten team members such as skilled social workers who can shape human health in important ways. Leadership and organizational structures in a learning healthcare system can must support the training and accountability of fully integrated interdisciplinary teams that in partnership with patients will design improved systems of care. Patients, caregivers, and payers can all win. Leaders in this new world order will increasingly be imbedded with the “troops,” positioned close to the sharp end of healthcare, avoiding the insulation of the leadership-suite. They will continue to elevate their close partnership with our clinical team, helping translate the strategy into action and breaking down the system, academic, financial, and administrative silos that can easily get in the way of providing the right care, for the right patient, at the right time, in the right place, with the right resources that we can rightfully sustain. We can and we must learn to cultivate intentional organizational structural changes that catapult us from the “me” to “we” value propositions as these will be required to create our preferred future. We are well on our way to create our preferred future—an ever-evolving learning health system in full partnership with patients and families, with nurses leading the way. Harnessing technology that already exists,92 we have the opportunity to craft our emancipation from the old ways. Supported by a transparent and easily accessible to all patient-centered data registry67 merging both maternal and neonatal data with new measures of patient-reported outcomes is also within our grasp. With these tools, we can cocreate new pathways for caring using shared decision-making expertise and tools. When we launched ANC in 2001, our organizational knowledge, skills, and technology support to do so simply did not exist. It was as they say in the business a “moon shot” and we were building the craft as we launched. As ANC turns 20 neonatal nurses are even more prepared and strategically positioned for the next moon shot—one that each of you will champion and lead. You have a growing foundation of evidence, are grounded in our history, are fueled by exponential expertise, and possess exemplary empathy and compassion. You also have an inordinate ability to inspire and innovate. And, most importantly, I fully trust that our collective journey to the future will be guided by an enduring passion for patients and families, striving each day to become more fully informed by their wisdom.

    "abstract": "HEALTH DISPARITY IN PERINATAL/NEONATAL SETTINGS: WHAT CAN NEONATAL NURSES DO? Black women and white women have similar incidences of breast cancer. However, mortality is 40% higher among Black women for various reasons, including that more Black women present at an advanced stage of the disease. Furthermore, health disparities do exist in perinatal settings across race, ethnicity, geographical locations, language, and varying socioeconomic factors, and some are unique to these populations.3 This short article briefly reviews available data important to the neonatal nurses and discusses the Vermont Oxford Network recommendations related to “Health Equity: Potentially Better Practices” published in August 2020.4 Neonatal nurses are experts in understanding the impact of maternal health on the health of neonates. Numerous pregnancy-related complications threaten the infants who traverse the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), such as gestational diabetes (GDM), preeclampsia, or even pregnancy-related death. Pregnancy-related deaths in the United States from 2007 to 2016 were 16.7 per 100,000 live births. The pregnancy-related death rate (per 100,000 live births) was higher for Black (n = 41) and American Indian/Alaskan Native women (n = 30) than for white women (n = 13).5 The proportion of race-specific disparity remained throughout the analyzed period (did not change over time, although we know that caregiving practices did improve during this time period). The Black to white disparity ratio was the highest for age 30- to 34-year-old category, with Black women 4 times more likely than white women to die from pregnancy-related complications. Education also had an impact. Women with less than high school education had twice the pregnancy-related mortality rate than college-educated women (21.6 vs 10.9, respectively); as you might guess, Black women were more represented in that group.5 Pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) is well known to neonatal nurses. PIH presents more than twice the stroke risk for Black and Hispanic women than for white women (Blacks: aRR= 2.07; 95% CI, 1.86-2.3; Hispanics: aRR = 2.19; 95% CI, 1.98-2.43). Further, considering all women with chronic hypertension, minority women experience a higher stroke risk (Blacks: aRR = 1.71; 95% CI, 1.30-2.26; Hispanics: aRR = 1.75; 95% CI, 2.32-5.63; Asian/Pacific Islanders: aRR = 3.62; 95% CI, 2.32-5.63). Even more striking is that Black women experience a higher stroke-risk even with no previous chronic hypertension before developing PIH.6 GDM is also a common subject in NICUs. Infants of diabetic mothers, even with well-controlled GDM, are at risk for a wide range of potential complications. Some women develop type 2 DM post-GDM experience. Black women are at a 63% higher risk (95% CI, 1.11-2.39; P = .01) than white women of developing type 2 DM after experiencing GDM.7 For Hispanic women, this risk is twice as high as that of the white women (hazard ratio = 2.22; 95% CI, 1.47-3.35; P < .001). The impact on neonatal morbidities is highly concerning. Infant mortality rates reveal significant disparities. The Black infant mortality rate in 2017 for the US was more than twice that of white infants (10.9 vs 4.7 per 1000 live births).8 Preterm birth is one of the main contributing factors to infant mortality. The overall US preterm birth rate (<37-week) in 2017 was 9.9%. Black preterm birth rate (13.9%) was significantly higher than white or Hispanic preterm birth rates (9.1% or 9.6%, respectively).9 Although preterm birth rate saw a decline from 2007 (10.44%) to 2014 (9.57%), an increase was seen in 2015 (9.63%). This increase was primarily due to a rise in preterm birth of Black and Hispanic infants.10 During the same period, rates of preterm birth less than 34 weeks remained relatively unchanged (2.93% in 2007, 2.81% in 2011, and 2.76% in 2015). The rate of preterm birth less than 34 weeks in 2015, however, was higher among the Black infants (3.09%) than among the white infants (1.27%). Recurrent preterm birth is higher among the Black women. Furthermore, Black women are more likely to face recurrent preterm births (aOR = 4.11; 95% CI, 3.78-4.47) and premature rupture of membrane (aOR = 6.4; 95% CI, 3.7-11) than white women.11 Recent findings related to racial/ethnic disparities for outcomes of extremely preterm infants born from 2002 to 201612 reported a decrease in hospital mortality rates across all groups, and rates of improvement over time were also similar (Black infants went from 35% to 24%, Hispanic from 32% to 27%, and white from 30% to 22%). However, rates of late-onset sepsis initially were higher for Black and Hispanic infants than for white infants (37%, 45%, and 36%, respectively); however, the prominent decrease narrowed the gap in the final years, with Black and Hispanic rates lower than those of the white infants (24%, 23%, and 25%, respectively). Composite outcomes of late-onset sepsis or death went from 59% to 40% for Black infants, 62% to 42% for Hispanic infants, and 54% to 40% for white infants over time, again, narrowing the gap. While the progress in care of the extreme preterm population is encouraging, perinatal/neonatal communities have begun only recently to address the disparity topic more robustly. In the position statement on racial disparity in the NICU, “NANN endorses healthcare equality for all infants regardless of race, parental economic or educational status or geographic areas.”13 Yet, bringing equality requires focused and purposeful efforts to understand the social determinants of health in addition to only race and ethnicity differences, such as “language” and communication abilities (health literacy com-pounded by those whose primary language is not English) of our families.14 This can be an uncomfortable topic to some, and it is even more uncomfortable to look in the mirror to examine our unconscious realm. The Vermont Oxford Network15 has invested in this topic at the annual quality congress in the recent years to raise awareness and to allow the voice of the minority patients and families to be heard. The newest publication by Horbar et al16 proposes that we must practice “social as well as technical medicine and follow through,” suggesting a more comprehensive set of efforts than currently accepted follow-up practices in order to support the NICU families when they take home high-risk infants. Potentially Better Practices for Follow Through is freely available online and includes recommendations to4: Promote a culture of equity; Identify social risks of families and provide interventions to prevent and mitigate those risks; Take action to assist families after discharge (transition to home); Maintain support for families through infancy; Develop robust quality improvement efforts to ensure equitable, high-quality NICU and follow-through care to all newborns by eliminating modifiable disparities; and Advocate for social justice at the local, state, and national levels. Neonatal nurses are collectively the strongest advocate for the NICU infants and their families; thus, being equipped with the knowledge of better practices to address disparity issues can make a difference today and in the future. Neonatal nurses need to consider how their own unconscious biases can potentially and subconsciously affect practices in more of a covert way. One may say that “I am not biased and no bias ever impacted my practice or attitude toward any families.” Next time, you meet a family who does not speak English, or a family who has vastly different practice norms than what you are used to, would you be able to step back a bit to reflect and reset your perspectives? Only when neonatal nurses can work toward establishing policies and standards that address these sensitive interactions or encounters that are critical to best practices with infants and families can we begin to promote a true culture of equity. We all need to be more self-aware and more considerate to those who may not come from your own culture, those of a different race, ethnicity, or social class.",

This relationship has not been explored in infants undergoing neonatal surgery (surgical infants).To evaluate the relationship between early exclusive B/LPOM feeds and cumulative B/LPOM patterns during surgical infants' neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) hospitalization.A secondary cross-sectional analysis was performed using the electronic health record data of surgical infants admitted to a level IV NICU between January 2014 and March 2015. Multiple linear regression and Fisher's exact test were used to examine the associations between first NICU feed type and total percentage of diet composed of B/LPOM during NICU stay and continuation of any or exclusive B/LPOM feedings at NICU discharge, respectively.The analysis included 59 infants who required surgery for gastrointestinal, cardiac, or multisystem defects or pregnancy-related complications. Receipt of B/LPOM as the first NICU feed was associated with higher percentage of B/LPOM feeds ( P < .001) throughout NICU stay, as well as continuation of any or exclusive B/LPOM feedings at NICU discharge ( P = .03).Early exclusive B/LPOM feeds may be an important predictor for continuation of any B/LPOM use throughout the NICU stay and at NICU discharge. Continued efforts to identify and address gaps in prenatal and postpartum lactation support for parents of surgical infants are needed.Powered studies are needed to corroborate these findings and to explore the potential impact of other factors on duration and exclusivity of B/LPOM use.https://journals.lww.com/advancesinneonatalcare/Pages/videogallery.aspx .",

    "abstract": "“CARING FOR BABIES AND THEIR FAMILIES: PROVIDING PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT IN THE NICU”: AN INNOVATIVE ONLINE EDUCATIONAL TOOL TO EMPOWER NEONATAL NURSES TO SUPPORT NICU FAMILIES Parents whose newborns are hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) nearly always experience stress. These parents have a higher prevalence of both postpartum depression (PPD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than new parents of infants born healthy, related in part to their perceptions of their experiences surrounding the birth of their infant or their NICU experiences that are traumatic. Prevalence of PPD among NICU mothers is 25% to 63%1,2 and for NICU fathers, approximately 36%,3 while rates of PTSD among NICU parents have been reported as 15% to 53% for mothers and 8% to 33% for fathers.4,5 A comprehensive evidence-based program is now available to empower neonatal nurses to support NICU families. The program is designed to psychosocially minimize the occurrence of both PPD and PTSD, and to optimize infant and family outcomes. This online continuing education (CE) program is entitled “Caring for Babies and Their Families: Providing Psychosocial Support in the NICU,” and it represents an exemplar for interprofessional collaboration in which family and other stakeholders improve education for neonatal health professionals, and ultimately the care in neonatal settings.6 My NICU Network was launched in January, 2018, with a mission of becoming the preeminent provider of compelling perinatal education on psychosocial support created with interprofessional collaboration. My NICU Network was recently expanded to become My NICU Network-My Perinatal Network (MNN-MPN), and is a collaborative endeavor between the National Perinatal Association7 and the NICU Parent Network.8 The goal is to provide online evidence-based education and “hands-on” bedside tools to empower healthcare staff working with mothers and infants. The focus of the education is to strengthen the critical parent–infant bonds and family functioning, and to improve developmental outcomes in the infant and mental health outcomes in their parents. The 3 key guiding principles of course development are: (1) supporting NICU parents is equally as important to providing medical care to their baby; (2) healthcare staff must also be emotionally supported, so that they will have the emotional capacity to support the patients and parents in their care; and (3) interprofessional collaboration models are the foundation to fully realize family-centered care. These principles have been central to program development from inception to conclusion of this project. Stakeholders who are recipients of care (NICU parent leaders) collaborated every step of the way in designing and implementing these educational programs. The courses are rich with parent stories, audio clips, and videos that illustrate learning points. Parents helped to create the courses, conducted the surveys from which parent stories have been gleaned; contributed resources including web links and downloads to be available for the learners who take the course; have been instrumental in the development of the course's trauma-informed care scripts. There are examples of what providers should not say to parents, how the parent interprets what the provider has said, and what is a better way to communicate the idea based on principles of trauma-informed care.9 Other parents have reviewed and provided feedback, which was used to refine the course content. All of this parental input has been the key to success of the program, as parents' testimonials bring the evidence from the literature to life. As one nurse stated after taking the program: “It was very eye opening to see things through the eyes of the parents.” Few educational programs exist that include NICU parent leaders at every level from content development to content delivery, making this a truly unique and comprehensive educational experience. All of the educational programs of MNN-MPN are based on principles of trauma-informed care, and NICU programs are based on the “Interdisciplinary Recommendations for Psychosocial Support of NICU Parents.”10 All are also available for CE credits. A study has demonstrated the efficacy of the initial learning program to improve nurses' knowledge and attitudes toward providing psychosocial care.11 The program consists of 7 courses including: communication skills, providing emotional support, peer-to-peer support, family-centered developmental care, palliative and bereavement care, discharge planning and follow-up, and caring for the caregiver (staff support). To date, over 700 NICU staff have completed the program, including the majority of nursing staff in 14 NICUs across the country. The goal for an entire NICU staff completing the program together is to transform the culture in the NICU to become more family-centered, and to mitigate long-term parental emotional complications such as PPD and PTSD. A condensed version of this program, called the Advanced NICU Provider Program, offers 2 CE credits for neonatologists and neonatal nurse practitioners. In mid-2020, 2 additional programs will be launched: “Caring for Pregnant Patients and Their Families: Providing Psychosocial Support During Pregnancy, Labor and Delivery” (for maternity care staff), and “Giving Birth During the Coronavirus Pandemic: Using Trauma-informed Care to Support Patients, Their Families, and Staff Through This Crisis” (for both NICU and maternity care staff). NICU parents need, desire, and benefit from the emotional support from the nurses. Nursing interventions may mitigate the evolution of parents' typically expected distress upon entering the NICU, preventing it from developing into full-blown depression or PTSD. Neonatal nurses who are at the bedside daily form more intimate relationships with infants and their families than other health professionals and are in a position to make a positive impact when well-equipped with strategies to address their complex psychosocial needs. NICU families value nurses; one study reported how the quality of relationship parents have with the nurses supported parental ability to cope and bond with their infants in the NICU.12 One of the most critical goals for neonatal nurses is to improve the parent–infant bond in NICU to optimize families' mental health/resilience, so that they can emerge as the empowered, confident, and knowledgeable advocates for their fragile infants who can achieve optimal development. Utilizing an innovative educational model, created through involvement of family stakeholders, can give nurses the tools they need to achieve this very important goal for the families in their care.

    "abstract": "Background: Placement of gastric tubes is commonly performed in infants and children but malpositioning is common and is associated with significant complications. Objective: The aim of this systematic review is to identify the evidence on the use of ultrasound to verify correct gastric tube placement in infants and children and gaps in the research. Methods: This review was performed using CINAHL, PUBMED, EMBASE and Web of Science databases. Studies were included if they used an empirical study design, were published in English, included infants or children, and evaluated the use of ultrasound to verify correct gastric tube placement compared to radiograph. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were evaluated. Results: Four articles were included in the review. Sensitivity estimates were 0.88 to 1.00 and a positive predictive value of 0.99 was reported in one study. Specificity was not reported in any of the included studies. Ultrasound may be an important method to correctly identify gastric tube placement in infants and children with less radiation exposure and cost. Implications for Practice: Ultrasound could be a used to verify gastric tube positioning in infants and children for both initial placement and continued verification leading to reduced radiation exposure and cost. Implications for Research: Research should focus on evaluating ultrasound specificity and the clinical feasibility of using ultrasound as a standard practice, including cost and time required to complete the exam, as well as the ability of ultrasound to verify gastric tube placement in infants weighing less than 1500 grams.",

    "abstract": "Thanks to all of you, Advances in Neonatal Care is thriving! Our impact factor has been rising steadily over the past 5 years. We are quite pleased that our content is being noticed and cited in the neonatal world and beyond. Our readership both inside and outside neonatal nursing is also thriving, as is the growing number of manuscript submissions. Manuscripts are currently being authored by nurses, physicians, and other interdisciplinary collaborators who work together to optimize care for infants and their families in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). We are also seeing an increasing number of submissions from international authors. This increased participation is all good news; we are grateful to our readership and the National Association of Neonatal Nurses for their support. However, recently, we noticed that an increasing number of our submissions are coming to us without nurse authors. We had a spirited discussion in our Editorial Board meeting about how best to address this issue. Advances in Neonatal Care is the official journal of the National Association of Neonatal Nurses. As such, we believe it is the premiere journal for neonatal nursing. In addition, we believe Advances in Neonatal Care takes a unique and dynamic approach to the original research and clinical practice articles it publishes. Our focus is on addressing nursing practice issues and sharing research findings that will assist neonatal nurses caring for low birth-weight infants in level II and level III NICUs around the globe. The journal promotes evidence-based care and improved outcomes for the tiniest patients and their families. Our vision is that Advances in Neonatal Care is the FIRST place neonatal nurses and neonatal care providers go to for the best evidence to support caregiving of NICU infants and families. Thus, our guiding purpose for Advances in Neonatal Care is to provide content that supports a foundation and direction for neonatal nurses in Increased Awareness, Education/Professional Development, Setting the Standard of Care, and Leadership, as well as the basis for an interface to the greater Community that supports neonatal intensive care. To that end, our author guidelines have been updated and beginning in 2022 we will no longer accept manuscript submissions for review where there is not at least one nurse author. The nurse author could be from a variety of practice roles such as bedside nurse, clinical nurse specialist, neonatal nurse practitioner, or nurse researcher. Manuscripts already under review or in the revisions process will not be affected by this change in our editorial practice. We do realize this decision could decrease our submissions or could lead to some “tokenism” where a nurse author is included on the draft manuscript just for the sake of being able to submit to our journal. Tokenism occurs when an individual is included as author even when their role might not meet the true definition for authorship. According to COPE (Committee on Publication Ethics; https://publicationethics.org), authors of manuscripts must meet several criteria. Specifically, all authors must make substantial contributions to the work including conception or design of the work; or acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data; as well as drafting the manuscript and critically reviewing the work before submission. This includes review and final approval of the manuscript submission by all authors. In short, all authors should be able to defend and answer questions about all aspects and sections of the manuscript with accuracy and integrity. We do ask all authors of manuscripts submitted to Advances in Neonatal Care to answer questions about authorship and conflict of interest during the submission process. While we don't yet publish how authors contribute as a note within the manuscript, some journals are beginning to include this information with the publication of an article. In summary, we believe that inclusion of a nurse as an author has the potential for many good outcomes. First and foremost, we believe this change in journal practices promotes neonatal nurses and our national association. It also promotes the importance of the role of neonatal nursing in optimizing outcomes for infants and families who must traverse the NICU. We already ask for nursing implications to be addressed in all manuscripts; this change in our editorial practices will strengthen the application of those nursing implications. Again, we thank you to our readership and for your submissions to Advances in Neonatal Care. Jacqueline M.

    "abstract": "The critical time to continue or stop breastfeeding is during the first month after hospital discharge. Mothers receive lactation and physical support by fathers and others bottle-feeding human or formula milk to their infants.To describe the effect of feeders (mothers, fathers, and others) and different milk feeding on infants' weekly exclusive breastfeeding rates, from birth to 1 month after discharge.This study was a secondary analysis of a descriptive longitudinal study of mothers' (full-term: n = 77; late preterm: n = 39) breastfeeding experience, frequency of feeding, and infant feeding behaviors. Mothers completed a weekly questionnaire of who (mothers, fathers, and others) fed their infants human or formula milk by direct breastfeeding or bottle-feeding.More than 60% of mothers reported fathers and others bottle-fed their infants. Exclusive breastfeeding rates were significantly higher when only mothers fed their infants at week 1 ( P < .001), week 3 ( P < .05), and week 4 ( P < .05). Exclusive breastfeeding rates were negatively affected across time by bottle-feeding any human or formula milk for all feeders. When fathers bottle-fed their infants at week 1, the relative rates of exclusive breastfeeding at week 4 decreased to 52% (OR = 0.103; 95% CI, 0.26-0.404; P < .0001).Individuals providing early bottle-feeding adversely affect breastfeeding outcomes. Providers need to address maternal and paternal knowledge gaps about early breastfeeding practice.Further research is needed to explore clinical standard of care for management of infant weight loss, early supplementation, and support of exclusive breastfeeding outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Assessing fluid output for infants in the neonatal intensive care unit is essential to understanding fluid and electrolyte balance. Wet diaper weights are used as standard practice to quantify fluid output; yet, diaper changes are intrusive and physiologically distressing. Less frequent diaper changes may have physiologic benefits but could alter diaper weights following extended intervals.This pilot study examined the impact of initial diaper fluid volume, incubator air temperature and humidity, and diaper brand on wet diaper weight over time. Baseline fluid volume was instilled, and then diapers were placed in a neonatal incubator. Wet diaper weight was assessed longitudinally to determine changes in fluid volume over time. A factorial design with repeated measures (baseline, 3 hours, and 6 hours) was used to explore the effects of diaper brand (brand 1 vs brand 2), baseline fluid volume (3 mL vs 5 mL), and incubator temperature (28°C vs 36°C) and humidity (40% vs 80%) on the trajectory of weight in 80 diapers.Wet diaper weight was significantly reduced over 6 hours ( P < .005). However, wet diaper weight increased in 80% humidity, but decreased in the 40% humidity over time ( P < .0001). Baseline fluid volume, incubator temperature, and diaper brand did not influence wet diaper weight over time (all P > .05).Understanding environmental factors that influence the trajectory of wet diaper weight may support clinicians in optimizing the interval for neonatal diaper changes to balance the impact of intrusive care with need to understand fluid volume loss.",

    "abstract": "Background: Premature infants experience alterations in maternal stimulation (including auditory sensory alteration such as talking or singing to the infant in the neonatal intensive care unit) due to admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. Because of their physiological and neurobehavioral immaturity, infants are at an increased risk of delays in reaching feeding milestones (a key developmental milestone), which often need to be achieved before discharge. Purpose: This systematic review evaluated the literature regarding the effect of maternal speech on achievement of feeding milestones in premature infants. Data Sources: A systematic search of CINAHL, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar from 2010 to 2021. Study Selection: Studies were selected if they examined the effect of maternal voice interventions on premature infants' feeding milestones. Data Extraction: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used. Results: Six studies were identified. This systematic review of the literature on the effects of maternal voice on feeding milestones in premature infants found equivocal results. Implications for Practice: Given the inconsistent results, this systematic review does not support a change in clinical practice. However, encouragement of maternal visits is highly recommended as the additional benefits of the mother's presence may extend beyond exposure to maternal voice. Implications for Research: More research is needed including use of more homogenous samples, application of recommended decibel levels, and utilization of an adequately powered randomized controlled trial to further examine the effects of maternal voice on feeding milestones.",

    "abstract": "Background: It has long been understood and acknowledged that the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) environment and the transport environments are extremely loud, with both long- and short-term sequelae to the neonate, being well over the recommended amount of noise by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). This problem has yet to be properly addressed. The purpose of this manuscript is to define and explain the concept of acoustic neuroprotection. While we cannot change the internal structures of the neonates’ auditory system, we could change the acoustics of the environment to be support neuroprotection of these sensitive patients. Evidence acquisition: Walker and Avant’s concept analysis steps were followed to create and define the idea of acoustic neuroprotection, as it has not had a definition before. A total of 45 articles from multiple search engines were chosen. A combination of 2 concepts were used: acoustic protection and neurodevelopmental protection/support. The search was expanded past 20 years for lack of research and importance of seminal works. Results: To achieve acoustic neuroprotection, a neonate should not be exposed to sound greater than 45 decibels (dBa) for longer than 10 s, and exposure to sound above 80 dBa should never occur. Appropriate interventions need to include supporting the neurodevelopment of the neonate through therapeutic sound, while decreasing the amount of toxic noise exposure to safe levels. Implications for Practice and research: By further understanding and having a quantifiable goal of acoustic neuroprotection for neonates, neonatal clinicians can work together to create new interventions for how to better protect and support the care of our tiniest patients.",

    "abstract": "Background: Enhancing the current breast pump sanitization method may improve maternal satisfaction and increase a mother’s likelihood of providing human milk for their hospitalized infants in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Other than Centers for Disease Control (CDC) data, there is lack of studies on sanitization practices. Currently, the only option in the hospital setting for breast pump equipment cleaning is a steam sanitization plastic bag. Purpose: Using the Q. Basin will increase participant satisfaction compared to the steam sanitization bag. Methods: A multi-phased pilot study was conducted in our quaternary care NICU to test the Q. Basin, a novel design developed to wash, dry, and safely steam sanitize breast pump equipment compared to the standard steam bag. A bacterial study was conducted on breast pump equipment from 10 mothers by swabbing the equipment immediately at hour zero and 24 hours. Twenty NICU mothers concurrently evaluated their satisfaction via a 3-question survey comparing the Q. Basin and the steam sanitization plastic bag method. Results: The results showed a 20% increase in satisfaction with Q. Basin compared to the steam bag method. Implications for Practice and Research: Data analysis from the satisfaction survey concludes that mothers pumping preferred the Q. Basin as a quicker, faster, and more environmentally friendly method for breast pump part sanitization. Additional safety and materials studies are required before using the Q. Basin in the clinical environment.",

    "abstract": "Background: Despite available training programs for neonatal advanced practice providers (Neo APP), including neonatal nurse practitioners and physician assistants, it is difficult to meet the demand for these providers. There are no publications regarding training models with greater than 1 Neo APP learner per mentor. Purpose: To create and measure outcomes of a 12-month program to educate Neo APP “Super-Mentors” able to train 2 Neo APP learners simultaneously. Methods: Super-Mentors were selected and attended monthly classes to learn mentorship concepts and receive support. Learners received didactic content and support through a Fellowship program. Quantitative data regarding recruitment and retention, as well as Misener Nurse Practitioner Job Satisfaction Scale (MNPJSS) results were compared pre- and postprogram. Qualitative satisfaction measures via survey from 21 stakeholders were analyzed through a phenomenological approach. Results: Six Super-Mentors trained 14 Neo APPs, as compared to 7 in the previous year. One Neo APP left after training. Summative preprogram MNPJSS scores were better (5.1 ± 0.37) than postprogram (4.7 ± 0.47) ( P &lt; .001). The most important preprogram subscale item was “vacation” versus “quality of assistive personnel” postprogram. Both pre- and postprogram scores reflected positive job satisfaction so differences may not be clinically significant. Qualitative program benefits included faster and increased onboarding, stronger relationships, and dedicated time. Challenges included role clarity among other stakeholders, learning culture, and spacial/technological logistics. Implications for Practice: Super-Mentors can train twice the number of Neo APP learners, with optimal preparation and support of all stakeholders, adequate space, and appropriate technology.",

    "abstract": "Background: Advanced neonatal resuscitation events are high-risk, low-volume critical situations. Healthcare systems have placed emphasis on improving resuscitation skills for advanced providers based on evidence showing that it can directly impact patient outcomes. Neonatal resuscitation program (NRP) renewal is only required every 2 years. This gap and low usage of skills can result in lack of competency and expertise leading to an increased risk of poor patient outcomes. Purpose: This project aimed to provide simulation education based on NRP curriculum for a large group of advanced providers at multiple level II, III, and IV neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and to improve confidence and knowledge in advanced resuscitation. Methods: A high-fidelity mannequin was used to simulate a reproducible, critical scenario that spanned the entire NRP algorithm. NRP knowledge and the effectiveness of simulation on confidence and knowledge in neonatal resuscitation were measured. Results: The average knowledge score from the pretest to the posttest improved by 7%. Based on the simulation evaluation tool-modified (SET-M), debriefing was the most effective in improving confidence and knowledge. The neonatal nurse practitioners (NNPs) with the most years of clinical experience had the largest improvement in knowledge. Implications for Practice and Research: With the most experienced NNPs providing majority of coverage in the Level II NICUs, a correlation may be drawn that the effect of simulations on NRP knowledge has a greater impact on these groups due to the low exposure of advanced resuscitation events at these sites. Debriefing stood out as the most critical component of simulation.",

    "abstract": "Background: Within the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), infants frequently receive packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions. Although medically necessary, potential negative long- and short-term outcomes exist following PRBC transfusions in very low birth-weight (VLBW) infants (&lt;1500 g). Synthesis of the literature demonstrates that the use of a restrictive PRBC transfusion policy can lead to a decreased number of transfusions administered with no increase in long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Blood transfusions have also been linked to the diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) or intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in VLBW infants. Purpose: For this quality improvement project, a restrictive PRBC transfusion policy was implemented in a level IV NICU to promote consistent care and evaluate changes in PRBC administration. Methods: The data were collected both pre- and post-policy implementation including: the number of blood transfusions, diagnosis of NEC, and diagnosis of IVH among infants &lt;1500 g. Results: The data showed no significant change in the number of PRBC transfusions administered. Likewise, few infants were diagnosed with NEC or IVH during this same time period with minimal change between pre- and post-policy implementation data. Implications for Practice and Research: Following policy implementation, there was a significant improvement in communication among providers regarding transfusion ordering and the inclusion of hematocrit thresholds in daily progress notes. This unintended outcome has helped to promote sustainability and enhance patient care within the NICU where this policy was implemented. Continued data collection may be beneficial in indicating whether a standardized PRBC transfusion policy will impact the administration of transfusions and diagnosis of NEC or IVH.",

    "abstract": "Background: This case describes chronic anemia of a late preterm infant secondary to maternal–fetal hemorrhage and subsequent findings of maternal choriocarcinoma. Clinical Findings: This infant was born at 35 6/7 weeks gestational age via cesarean section for non-reassuring fetal heart tones. The mother presented with decreased fetal movement and the biophysical profile was 4/8. Following delivery, the infant did not require respiratory support, was vigorous with extreme pallor, and had a hemoglobin of less than 5 on cord gas. Primary Diagnosis: Chronic anemia secondary to fetomaternal hemorrhage. Interventions: The infant’s initial hemoglobin was 2.4 and hematocrit was 8.1. The mother’s Kleihauer-Betke test was elevated at 7%. The infant required a partial exchange transfusion following admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. Following the partial exchange transfusion, the infant began to experience increasing respiratory distress and required respiratory support. An echocardiogram showed severe persistent pulmonary hypertension of the neonate. The mother was subsequently diagnosed with choriocarcinoma. Outcomes: The infant fully recovered from chronic anemia and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the neonate and was discharged home with the mother. The infant required follow-up testing for choriocarcinoma outpatient. Practice Recommendations: Newborns diagnosed with early chronic anemia should be evaluated, the cause investigated, and appropriate treatment considered. If the cause of blood loss is unknown, a maternal Kleihauer-Betke test should be considered. In this case, a partial exchange transfusion was performed to avoid cardiovascular volume overload, but another course of treatment could include small aliquots of packed red blood cell transfusions.",

    "abstract": "Background: Due to the geographical distance, work obligations, and parenting responsibilities, it is often difficult for parents to visit the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Limited parent presence might also constrain updates about infant status thus increasing anxiety, which potentially leads to a stronger necessity for visitation. Purpose: Examine the evidence for use of electronic visit (eVisit) technology for parents of newborns in NICU, for example, do eVisits decrease anxiety and are there other factors that demonstrate effectiveness. Data Sources: Seven databases were used to search for evidence from 1 January 2000 to 13 November 2023. Study Selection: Studies were included with terms related to eHealth, NICU, infant, parent and 41 eligible studies were assessed. Data Extraction: Data were extracted by 2 reviewers with a systematic-staged review approach. Results: Eight studies with a total of 1450 cases were included. Results of meta-analysis showed that eVisit technology improved anxiety compared with conventional visitation (MD = − 5.04, 95% CI [−5.92, − 4.17], P &lt; .01) and hospitalization satisfaction (RR = 1.09, 95% CI [1.05, 1.13], P &lt; .01), but the effect was not significant with regard to reduction in infant length of stay (MD = − 1.07, 95% CI [−5.39, 3.25], P = .63). Implications for Practice and Research: A large sample, high-quality, multi-centered randomized controlled study needs to be conducted to validate the effect of eVisit technology on the psychological state of parents, implications for nursing practice as well as potential newborn affects to improve future ease of use. Video Abstract: Available for more insights from the authors. This video shows the concept, current status, significance, and implications for practice and research of eVisit technology.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic affected the maternal-infant dyad, especially due to visitation restrictions in neonatal units. These changes may impact the psychological, physical, and developmental health of mothers and newborns. This systematic review evaluates the impact of enforced separation and restrictive visitation policies in neonatal units during the pandemic, focusing on the maternal-infant dyad. Data sources include CINAHL, MEDLINE, Web of Science, APA PsycINFO, Academic Search Ultimate, and Embase, covering studies published between 2020 and 2024. A detailed search was conducted using terms related to COVID-19, maternal and neonatal health, and visitation restrictions in neonatal units. Articles were included if they were peer-reviewed, written in English, and focused on the impact of visitation restrictions on maternal and neonatal health. The data extraction process began with 789 references. After removing duplicates, we screened titles and abstracts. We then conducted a full-text assessment of the remaining studies, selecting 14 that met the inclusion criteria. The analysis showed significant emotional, psychological, and developmental impacts on mothers and newborns due to pandemic-induced separation and inconsistent policies. It highlighted depressive symptoms, stress, bonding disruptions, and the effectiveness of virtual bonding. The review emphasizes the need for family-centered care, coping strategies, and virtual bonding in neonatal units. It calls for culturally sensitive policies to support mothers and infants during crises. The review also highlights the importance of studying the long-term effects of pandemic-induced separations and improving support for future health emergencies.",

At 1 month of life, the infant was found to be chimeric for blood types O and A. Genetic testing revealed mosaic trisomy 9 as the cause for the 2 distinct blood types. Without phenotypic presentation of trisomy 9, the infant's genetic diagnosis was not detected until an issue arose. Genetic diagnosis and treatment and future considerations are discussed in this article. Full-text English articles from CINAHL and PubMed were analyzed for assistance in understanding the infant's condition. Book chapters, review articles, and meta-analyses were also reviewed. Implications of this case study indicate that phenotypically normal presenting infants may still have underlying issues that should be investigated genetically when they arise.

    "abstract": "Both Jackie McGrath and Deb Brandon have written an excellent editorial to encourage readers of Advances in Neonatal Care to write for this publication (“Writing Is Not Just for Other People,” Adv Neonatal Care. 2014; 14(2): 69-71). Please let me add the following: Along with paying taxes and dying, most people (not just nurses) despise public speaking and writing. As I have always told my graduate students in advanced practice nursing, educated nurses are able to write and speak, so you will be doing both. Writing and public speaking are NOT genetic! The more you do of both, the better you get at each of these skills—just like riding a bicycle or advancing from novice to expert in clinical practice. Nurses for too long have been the silent and invisible healthcare providers, despite the facts that we are the most “trusted” by society and are the majority of the healthcare workforce. Be silent no more! When a neonatal nurse at one of my conferences shares a practice change or a case study, my first response is: “are you writing this up and where are you publishing this?” You must share your wisdom and experience with your colleagues! Let's stop reinventing the wheel and move the art and science of nursing forward by writing. I am often asked if I started out to write a book. My response is: “Never, do I look stupid to you?” Having written a bestselling handbook, it is both a gift and a curse! A gift in that my “baby” is loved and a curse in that it has to be revised every 2 years. But I have come to love the process and the colleagues I have written with and the new colleagues who have the opportunity to contribute as the older ones retire. I too would like to offer my services, along with the 2 fine editors of this journal, to anyone who needs help with the writing process. My advice to get started echoes what has been given—write an outline, or at least a list of ideas about a topic that you are interested in and passionate about. Write the first paragraph and the article's conclusion last. You cannot tell the reader what the article is going to be about until after you have written it! Start on the “easiest” section first and build the article around it—computers make this easy to do! If you start to write and get “writer's block,” stop and walk the dogs. Just stepping away briefly helps clear your mind and the words begin to come. The more you write, the less writer's block you get. Just as my grandmother told me never to sew when you are tired because you make mistakes, never try to write when you are tired. Writers read! So if you want to write a case report, pick up this or other nursing journals and read several case reports to see how they are written and how the ideas flow together. If you want to write about a practice change, read articles about practice change and see how they are written. Writers write! Write a little every day. Write a paragraph, and then try 2 or more. As you exercise your “writing” brain it becomes easier. Write and let what you have written get “cold”—do not look at it for several days. Then pick it up and read it—sometimes you'll like what you read and sometimes you'll think: “Who wrote this and what is this trying to say?” Then edit, revise, and rewrite if needed. Writers contribute! Nothing sharpens your skills quite like having to commit your thinking to print. You have to know what you are talking about and you find that out by reviewing the literature on your chosen topic. PubMed and the computer again make this easy! Know what the literature says about your topic and how and why what you have to contribute is new and different. Writers are empowered! There is power in the written word; that is why writing empowers. Your article about a practice change might be just what a colleague whom you do not know, have never met, and might never meet needs to empower her to start on the practice change in her setting. The process you used to make the practice change and even the mistakes that you encounter empowered you and the reader of your article to succeed. This year I am celebrating my 47th year as a neonatal and pediatric nurse; I have never been bored in this specialty! I would be honored to assist anyone who would like to begin or perfect their writing skills. Feel free to contact me on my Web site at http://www.professionaloutreachconsultation.com so that we can set up a conference call and get started! RESPONSE FROM THE COEDITORS We appreciate Sandra's support of Advances in Neonatal Care, and the support she is offering to our potential authors. Although Sandra is a neonatal consultant, she assures us she will facilitate authors writing for Advances in Neonatal Care for free! We hope you will take her up on her offer and contact her about how best to present your work; we look forward to seeing your submissions about the great things you are doing to improve care for the vulnerable patients and families we serve.",

    "abstract": "The abstract is the most important words you can assemble to introduce, summarize, and, to some degree, “sell” your scholarly work to the readers.1–3 It is important to remember that oftentimes readers will stop after the abstract if they are not convinced your work is important to their needs. Regardless of what type of abstract you are writing, many of the same principles apply, most importantly, be clear and concise. The purpose of this editorial is to provide guidance for authors about how to write for poster, paper, and conference session presentations as well as the manuscript abstract. We timed this editorial to persuade all of our readers to consider submitting an abstract for NANN's 31st Annual Education Conference in Dallas, Texas, October 22–25, 2015. The abstracts are due November 2, 2014. Whether you are a neonatal staff nurse, advanced practice nurse, nurse educator, or researcher, we hope you will consider developing an abstract for the annual conference. If you have an evidence-based practice project, quality improvement project, or research findings, please also consider submitting an abstract to the 2015 NANN Research Summit in Scottsdale, Arizona, from March 24-26, 2015. Abstracts for the summit will be due at the end of January 2015. Finally, we hope you take your abstract submissions from the annual conference and research summit and convert them into manuscripts for Advances in Neonatal Care (ANC). If you are a new author, our entire ANC editorial board is poised and ready to mentor you through the manuscript submission process. If you have questions about how to work with an editorial board member, please feel free to contact us via our e-mails at the end of this editorial. WRITING THE ABSTRACT Most “calls” for conference abstracts and journals have specific instructions for an abstract. Please follow the abstract directions carefully. In many cases, the abstract cannot be uploaded into the electronic submission system if you have not followed the instructions and even if you can upload the abstract, most reviewers are unenthusiastic with an author who does not follow directions. In other words, if you do not want your abstract rejected without adequate consideration, just follow the directions. The abstract instructions typically include information about the content to include, the word limit, and whether a structured format is required. The content of the abstract will vary depending upon the type or focus of the scholarly work you are summarizing. Abstracts may summarize a clinical practice innovation, clinical practice challenge, case study, literature review, program evaluation, best practice implementation, or research. The word limit for abstracts can vary greatly, depending upon the conference or journal, but they are typically between 150 and 250 words.3 The format of the abstract can be structured or nonstructured. A structured format uses specifically labeled section headings to guide the author. Structured formats were developed in the late 1980s as a guide for authors, particularly in healthcare, to ensure inclusion of pertinent information.4 The use of structured formats is also thought to help with critique of the abstract by reviewers and editors as well as improve literature searches when abstracts are published as the summary of a manuscript. The content included in unstructured formats is often the same as for structured abstracts, but without the specific headings. If a format is not required and you are new to writing abstracts, the use of a structure format may make the process of writing the abstract somewhat easier. ABSTRACT OUTLINE The following is a generally accepted outline of the most important content to be included in an abstract. In a structured abstract, there are many different terms used for the same content and thus we have listed various terms that denote similar content. Background/Significance/Rational/Problem Statement (2–3 sentences). The background typically includes some general information about the problem or issue to be discussed. For well-known issues/problems, the background should specify how you will address the issue or why it is important to address the issue/problem at this point in time. This section answers the question: “What gap in practice or research does this manuscript or presentation fill?” The last sentence in this section is often a purpose statement for the scholarly work to be presented. For example, “the purpose of this study was to evaluate the implementation of a cue-based feeding protocol on the time to full oral feedings in preterm infants.” “the purpose of this session is to describe the nonpharmacological and pharmacological management of gastrointestinal reflux disease. Methods (variable). The Methods section tells “how” the work was conducted for research, best practice implementation, program evaluation, and quality improvement scholarly work. The “how” includes information about the process used and setting and population. For clinically focused abstracts, the Methods section is the most important part of the abstract. This section includes details of the clinical issue to be discussed and typical patient and family outcomes.1 Findings/Results (variable). The new information or what you learned from your work is included in the Findings/Results section. For example, your evaluation of a new clinical innovation may find that gastrointestinal reflux disease symptoms are improved or your review of the literature may find that we have little evidence to support the use of a particular product or method to secure an oral gastric tube. Discussion/Conclusions/Interpretation (1–2 sentences). The last part of any abstract briefly summarizes your take-home message to the reader. Depending upon the focus of the scholarly work, the take-home message may include implications for practice, education, public policy, or further research. Although conference abstracts are never written after the presentation is completed, most manuscript abstracts are written after the manuscript is finished. Many authors may have a preliminary draft of the abstract, especially if it was written for a previous conference presentation. Most abstracts require significant revision once the manuscript is completed. Typically authors may add to the significance of their work with the continued reflection required in writing the manuscript. Therefore, be sure to give yourself adequate time to write this important summary so that you can appropriately “sell” your work. Once you finish your abstract, it is also a good time to reexamine your manuscript title to assess whether the 2 are adequately matched.3 Finally, you are ready to submit your work. By 2015, we hope to update our specific author instructions, including abstract guidelines for each type of manuscript submission. While we expect that all of the abstracts will be limited to 250 words, there will likely be different components requested, depending on the specific journal section the manuscript is intended to address. Keep an eye out for guideline updates on the ANC and Editorial Manger Web sites. Sharing your expertise through dissemination of your scholarly work whether at a conference or through a manuscript is not only important to advance your career, but also to give back to the nursing profession through the education of all neonatal nurses from the novice to the expert.

    "abstract": "THE BABY-FRIENDLY NICU The by now well-known Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative was originally developed to promote breastfeeding through the application of “Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding.” Although geared toward the healthy newborn, these steps also had important lessons for promoting breastfeeding and encouraging mothers to supply expressed milk for their infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). NICUs have used the original recommendations to increase rates of breastfeeding and breast milk expression for preterm infants.1 Babies in the NICU, and their mothers, however, have needs and challenges that differ from those of a healthy term newborn population. Therefore, the baby-friendly hospital experts have now created a set of steps for baby-friendly neonatal intensive care that take these differences into account and offer mechanisms for staff to promote breastfeeding and human milk feeding in the NICU. These recommendations, recently published in the Journal of Human Lactation,2 include the following: Have a written breastfeeding policy that is routinely communicated to all healthcare staff. Educate and train all staff in the specific knowledge and skills necessary to implement this policy. Inform hospitalized pregnant women at risk for preterm delivery or birth of a sick infant about the management of lactation and breastfeeding and benefits of breastfeeding. Encourage early, continuous, and prolonged mother-infant skin-to-skin contact (kangaroo mother care) without unjustified restrictions. Show mothers how to initiate and maintain lactation and establish early breastfeeding with infant stability as the only criterion. Give newborn infants no food or drink other than breast milk, unless medically indicated Enable mothers and infants to remain together 24 hours a day. Encourage demand feeding or, when needed, semidemand feeding as a transitional strategy for preterm and sick infants. Use alternatives to bottlefeeding at least until breastfeeding is well established and use pacifiers and nipple shields only for justifiable reasons. Prepare parents for continued breastfeeding and ensure access to support services/groups after hospital discharge. These steps were developed around the 3 guiding principles known to influence the outcomes of breastfeeding: (1) The staff attitude to the mother must focus on the individual mother and her situation; (2) The facility must provide family-centered care, supported by the environment; and (3) The healthcare system must ensure continuity of pre-, peri-, and postnatal care and postdischarge care. 1.

BREAST MILK EXPRESSION IN THE NICU: LOCATION MATTERS Mothers who wish to breastfeed their preterm infants and have embarked on pumping can become discouraged by low expressed milk volumes, and some will even cease pumping as a result. Therefore, interventions to increase pumping volumes are important in encouraging mothers to continue to provide milk for their hospitalized infants. Most NICUs support pumping in many different ways, one of which is providing pumping rooms located conveniently to the NICU. But could we do even better? A recent study1 asked whether location matters in pumping. Does the volume of milk pumped by mothers of VLBW infants vary as a function of proximity to the infant, and can pumping volumes be increased by the use of skin-to-skin positioning during the actual expression of milk? This prospective cohort study was conducted in 26 mother-infant pairs. Mothers who were pumping were given a diary, in which they recorded the milk volumes obtained and the location of milk expression for 10 consecutive days. Possible locations included the mother's home, a remote pumping room at the hospital, within the NICU beside the infant's incubator, or within the NICU during or after skin-to-skin (kangaroo) care. They found that mean milk volumes were significantly higher when expression took place in proximity to the infant compared with expression in a remote pumping room or at home. When only milk expressions conducted in proximity to the infant were considered, volumes obtained during skin-to-skin care (107.7 mL, range 91.8-123.5 mL) and after skin-to-skin care (117.7 mL, range, 99.0-136.5 mL) were significantly higher than those obtained beside the incubator (96.9 mL, 79.9- 113.9 mL), respectively (P= .0030 and P= .0024). This study has several limitations, including its small size, and the fact that milk volumes were measured by the mothers, not by the investigators, without blinding to pumping location. However, the consistent trend toward higher expressed volumes the closer the proximity to the infant provides evidence for the design of NICUs with sufficient space and equipment to facilitate bedside pumping. The finding that pumped volumes are highest when pumping takes place at the bedside immediately after skin-to-skin care will be useful to nurses in supporting milk expression efforts by mothers of preterm infants. 1. Acuna-Muga J, Ureta-Velasco N, de la Cruz-Bertolo J, et al. Volume of milk obtained in relation to location and circumstances of expression in mothers of very low birth weight infants. J Hum Lact. 2014;30:41–46. DONOR HUMAN MILK: THE RISK-BENEFIT RATIO When maternal breast milk is not available or the supply is insufficient, the alternatives for feeding preterm infants are formula or donor human milk. The nonnutritive benefits of breast milk would seem to tip the scales in favor of using donor human milk in spite of the extra costs associated with processing, storage, and handling. However, formula has advantages as well, particularly a more consistent delivery of the optimal level of nutrients needed by preterm infants. So what is the best evidence-based choice? A new Cochrane review1 supplies answers. A review of 9 trials involving 1070 preterm/low-birth-weight infants evaluated the effects of feeding with formula or donor breast milk (with or without fortification) on growth and development. Although methodological weaknesses were identified (such as a lack of blinding), these trials show that formula-fed infants had higher in-hospital weight gain and increases in head circumference, but these differences did not persist after discharge nor did formula influence neurodevelopmental outcomes. Compared with donor breast milk, formula feeding increased the risk for necrotizing enterocolitis. This review leads to the conclusion that feeding with formula achieves a higher rate of short-term growth, but the trade-off is a higher risk for necrotizing enterocolitis. 1.

ENCOURAGING AFRICAN AMERICAN MOTHERS TO BREASTFEED Breastfeeding rates among African-American women have historically been lower than those among white or Hispanic women in the United States.1 Some of the differences may be cultural or arising from the influence of family or friends.2 Evidence also suggests that laws pertaining to breastfeeding in the workplace may differentially affect African Americans, making continued breastfeeding more difficult for these women.3 In spite of these obstacles, targeted educational interventions can increase breastfeeding rates in this population.4 With this in mind, the Office of the Surgeon General has the It's Only Natural campaign (http://www.womenshealth.gov/itsonlynatural/) aimed at increasing successful breastfeeding in African American women. Resources include pregnancy preparation for breastfeeding, overcoming breastfeeding challenges, dispelling breastfeeding myths, fitting breastfeeding into a woman's life, and building a network of support for breastfeeding. Specific topics include dealing with a lack of support for breastfeeding, involving fathers, breastfeeding for single mothers, and returning to work while breastfeeding. Nurses who work with new mothers should become familiar with these resources, which will continue to be valuable to African American mothers after they go home from the hospital. 1.

GOING BAG-FREE FOR BREASTFEEDING SUCCESS Sending formula home with mothers who have decided to breastfeed, however well-intentioned, can have a negative impact on breastfeeding success. It has been demonstrated that hospital “discharge packs” or “gift bags” containing formula samples or formula coupons, even when disguised as “breastfeeding packs” are associated with shorter duration of breastfeeding.1 Such “gifts” to new mothers are inevitably a form of marketing, and by handing them out, may imply that we endorse formula feeding in spite of the mother's acknowledged desire to breastfeed. A recent study shows that receiving formula discharge packs conveys a covert message to some mothers that they are expected to fail at breastfeeding.2 Some women receive subtle messages from formula advertising that formula is a solution for infant fussiness, spitting up, and crying, and are uncertain whether formula is inferior, superior, or equivalent to breastfeeding.2 The idea that formula marketing erodes a mother's confidence in her ability to breastfeed has prompted many hospitals and birth centers to discontinue the practice of sending home formula discharge packs with breastfeeding mothers.3 The state of Massachusetts took this a step further, banning the practice of distributing industry-sponsored discharge bags in each of the state's 49 maternity facilities.4 To find out how these facilities, and their patient populations, have reacted to the discharge bag ban, Hurwitz and colleagues4 conducted a survey of the state's birthing facilities (response rate 100%). They found that 59% of the facilities replaced the formula company bag with their own gift bag carrying the hospital's logo. These bags either were empty or contained educational materials and/or a gift such as a T-shirt or baby book. Another 14% gave a gift without a bag, and 27% gave no gift. The cost to the hospital ranged from $1 to $35 (mean = $10.67). These findings suggest that eliminating discharge gifts was a readily accepted and low-cost way to promote best practices in breastfeeding.",

    "abstract": "Have you ever started a project reluctantly but did so by diving right in, intent to “figure it out” but without reading the directions? I certainly did last weekend when helping my 8-year-old daughter build a craft from Home Depot. In a rush, we left the store before she was finished. At home the responsibility to read the instructions was left to me, so together we could achieve the motto, “let's build something together.” First, we laid out the pieces and took a careful look at what the finished product was to look like. Next, we arranged the parts so that they lined up exactly with what the instruction pictures showed. Pretty soon, we had made a few comical errors but finished the project. A competing priority to the project on this holiday weekend was the knowledge that I needed to write a similar “how to” set of instructions to tell new writers the steps in constructing an evidence-based practice (EBP) brief. In this editorial, I will provide instructions to make the task of writing a brief manageable for even the newest of authors. From asking a compelling clinical question to telling the story of a critical appraisal of evidence to making recommendations, the overall goal of writing such a brief is to support best practice care in the neonatal intensive care unit. DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY OF EBP BRIEFS Over the last 5 years, authors have been writing briefs for Advances in Neonatal Care (ANC). Initially, editorial board members were solicited to author the manuscripts and peer review was completed by the section editor. In the early days, abstracts were not included and the structure of the brief was not specified. Still, authors were addressing clinically relevant topics including nonpharmacologic pain management,1 incubator humidity,2 the use of ultrasound to guide peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) placement,3 and managing desaturations in preterm infants.4 Best practice for splinting intravenous cannulas5 and approaches to reduce gastroesophageal reflux were also explored.6 Progressively, author guidelines specifically for the brief have become more structured, and now we are moving to the manuscripts being reviewed through the routine peer-review process used by the journal. As such, authors have the opportunity to respond to reviewer's comments to strengthen and refine the manuscripts when resubmitting. Although papers have at times been longer, the intent is to still keep the briefs just that—brief. In a structured, consumable format, bedside clinicians will be able to quickly read through and comprehend the state of the evidence for the routine practices they deliver right at the bedside. EBP BRIEF TOPICS Selecting a topic for the brief can arise from several sources. One approach is to look at what the practice trends are and another is to select a policy or procedure that is up for review in your particular clinical setting and focus the brief around 1 or the other. Another consideration is what briefs have explored recently (ie, <3-5 years). Table 1 includes topics covered recently and the associated clinical questions used to guide the searches. In my case, I selected topics on the basis of issues that bothered me so I could channel that negative energy to look into the caregiving area of concern deeply and critically. Beginning with best practice approaches to structure shift handoffs,7 to exploring the evidence about the use of colostrum as oral immune therapy,8 the questions I asked reflected my broader interests as a nurse scientist. Other authors have written about which tool to measure neonatal abstinence symptoms was best,9 or how to standardize practice when the best practice was not clear (eg, What is the best practice for securing the umbilical line?”).10 No matter the topic, at the core of any excellent EBP brief is a focused clinical question.TABLE 1-a: Summary of EBP Brief Questions Addressed (2011-2015)TABLE 1-b: Summary of EBP Brief Questions Addressed (2011-2015)TABLE 1-c: Summary of EBP Brief Questions Addressed (2011-2015)PURPOSE STATEMENTS What many authors may not realize is that there is a bit of formulaic work to writing a scientific manuscript—there is a recipe to it. One example of this is to clearly define your purpose of the manuscript and place it strategically as the last sentence of the introduction. Another important strategy for making sure that your work is found is to include key words that mimic the key words you used for your search strategy. Including the maximum amount of key words allowed will increase the possibility your article will be found by those interested. For example, key words for this editorial could include “evidence-based practice, neonate, nursing, critical appraisal, and neonatal intensive care unit.” Furthermore, while catchy, interesting titles engage one's interest—a scientific audience is also likely looking for a title that is descriptive and declarative, minimizing the use of question marks. That said, we have published titles with question marks and catchy titles, and 1 of their benefits is that they are easy to remember. FOCUSING THE CLINICAL QUESTION Clinical questions explore topics that can be directly translated today to impact patient care, education, or best practice in the clinical environment. Four components of a great clinical question include specifying the 4 PICO components (1) the population (P); (2) the intervention or practice (I); (3) the comparison group (C); and (4) the outcome of interest (O).27 Successful focusing of the clinical question depends in part on how clearly you can define the outcome. Historically, the focused briefs (and indeed the shorter ones) had very tightly defined outcomes and interventions. This is not to say 1 approach trumps another—it just speaks to the breadth of ways to ask clinical questions and structure briefs. Once you have defined the clinical question, each PICO component can be entered as search criteria when you conduct your literature search. According to the author guidelines, the clinical question is posed in both the abstract and within the body of the manuscript. Over the history of the EBP briefs, the questions asked vacillated between broad questions exploring the state of the evidence in an area to focused questions like “do infants fed during blood transfusion get necrotizing enterocolitis more often than those who are not fed during transfusion?”13 Although topics covered in EBP briefs have been broad over the last 5 years, topics we are particularly interested in for the future include management strategies for critically ill infants who are not very low birth-weight, glucose management options, and issues of particular concern to the registered nurse at the bedside. SEARCH STRATEGY Approaches to searching the literature are vast and well discussed elsewhere,28 yet there are a few key points to address when writing your brief. First, define your databases searched. A best practice is to search at least 2 databases, and most authors begin with PubMed and the Cochrane library. When looking at nursing or psychosocial interventions, CINAHL and Psych Info are very helpful and include nursing and psychological literature. Although broad Internet searches can occasionally identify good sources, it is important to focus them to look for guidelines or position statements from professional organizations (see Table 2 for EBP sources). Once you identify your databases, conduct your reviews using structured key terms. Keeping track of your search terms used, your inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, and counts of articles retrieved will strengthen the methodology section of your brief. Although not required, if you choose to conduct a systematic review, following standards to report the systematic review will strengthen your brief and chances for a smooth review process (see www.prisma.org for more details about this type of review). More often EBP briefs are categorized as narrative or integrative reviews.TABLE 2: Evidence Resources for EBPCRITICAL APPRAISAL Next steps include assessing how the studies you identified fall according to levels of evidence. Although many stratification schemes for levels of evidence exist, ones that incorporate the types of studies at high interest for nurses (ie, should categorize qualitative and descriptive studies) and/or adhere to disciplinary standards (eg, a scheme that is commonly used in the Neonatal Cochrane Reviews or the AHRQ sponsored Clinical Practice Guidelines) is efficient. In general, when discussing the levels of evidence, meta-analyses and systematic reviews are considered to be the highest quality, whereas expert opinion is considered the lowest. Other considerations include whether randomization was used, if the study was single or multisite, and how many participants were included. In neonatal care, it is also generally important to consider if they looked at groups by gestational age or birth weight. Finally, I always look to see where the studies were conducted, how they were funded, and where they were published. This information helps you to consider whether there are any biases in the results. Sample characteristics should always be reported to allow the critical appraiser to determine if the participants in the study had characteristics similar to the infants or units with which you want to compare and/or apply the results. WRITING RESULTS Although there are different approaches to summarizing studies, 1 very nice one is to construct a table for the studies. The studies are listed as rows, and the columns are the different key aspects of the study. Common column titles include authors/year/country, study design/subjects, results, and implications. Good examples of evidence tables are available from past EBP briefs including by Hartley et al,26 Newnam,9 Allen,21,23 and Garcia and Gephart.19 Including outcome statistics in your tables will help you and your readers to understand how much of an impact the intervention of interest had or to see what the strength of the intervention effect was. When using abbreviations in this table, include a legend at the bottom that provides a key for spelling out any abbreviations you might use. Although you might construct your table with lots of detail, you may want to include a less detailed table in your final manuscript. Space is always an issue and remember you want your reader to look at the table and quickly understand it rather than be overwhelmed by a table that goes on for pages. Now that you have the studies in a form where you can look across the studies for similarities and differences, this is a good time to identify where and how results were consistent across studies and where they were different. When different, you can hypothesize about why they were different. Consider the breadth of the study locations (eg, 2 were multisite; 3 were individual sites), rigor of research designs (eg, blinded randomized controlled trial vs descriptive study without a comparison group), and sample diversity. When writing the “Results” section of your brief, the reviewers are looking for synthesis of what the findings were versus a rehashing of individual studies or listing them 1 by 1. Describing results is a main section for the EBP brief. Ideally, if you present the results in sufficient detail, the reader can check your recommendations and determine whether they agree or disagree with them. MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS There are 2 sets of recommendations we want in an EBP brief (1) for practice and (2) for research. We have even asked you to summarize this at the end of your article with a list of recommendations using the headings (1) What we know, (2) What needs to be studied, and (3) What we can do today. Recommendations for practice may be presented as a sample protocol like those published for feeding protocols,16 colostrum for oral care,8 or facilitated tucking.26 Reading the discussion sections for the studies you reviewed can help you to write recommendations for research. Examples of recommendations for research can include the use of more rigorous study designs, more diverse samples, or tailoring the intervention to fit local contexts. Available position statements from professional organizations like the National Association of Neonatal Nurses, American Academy of Pediatrics, or other reputable sources can support your ideas when writing this section as well. INCLUDING TABLES AND FIGURES Tables and figures in your article should add detail where it is needed but also serve to engage your reader. Some busy readers will read the abstract, the last sentence of your introduction (to determine the article's purpose), and then focus their attention on the tables and figures. Although your paper should read well from start to finish and present a coherent train of thought and logical reasoning, it is a good approach to write also for the reader who does not read sequentially. Focusing on writing very clear purpose statements; adding a topic and concluding sentence for each paragraph; and refining your tables, figures, abstract, and conclusion will engage the reader who tends to jump from section to section to read for their interests or needs. Finally, if the brief is about a clinical practice that you can depict in a picture, including a picture will add interest to your paper. PREPARING TO SUBMIT Preparing to submit your brief includes proofreading, assembling individual document files, and uploading the documents into the file submission system Editorial Manager. A checklist is provided in Table 3. An important first step is to ask a naive reader to review the brief to give you constructive feedback. Incorporate their revisions and read the revised brief out loud to yourself. This is a good way to catch typographical errors, issues with grammar, and mixed verb tenses. If you have any very long sentences (eg, >3 lines long), break into shorter sentences. Mixing more complex sentences structures with short ones is a good way to keep your reader's interest. Compose a cover letter telling the editorial office that the paper has not under consideration with another journal, and it is your original work. Gather copyright transfer forms from all of your coauthors. Finally, assemble your documents with each table, figure, cover letter, copyright transfer, and manuscript file ready to upload separately.TABLE 3: Checklist for Writing and Submitting an EBP BriefRESPONDING TO REVIEW FOR RESUBMISSION Once your article is received, reviewers are invited to read it and offer their opinion about its readiness for publication and to propose recommendations to improve the manuscript. It is common to have 3 to 5 reviews to respond to and ultimately the process is meant to refine the final product before publication. Tips for responding to reviewers comments are described elsewhere for this journal.29 Reviewers may disagree or offer suggestions that the authors disagree with at times. If this is the case, it will show your responsiveness if you can offer justification for why a change was not made that a reviewer recommended. Structuring response to reviewers in a table with 1 column for the reviewers comment and the second column for your response is a strong approach for showing your careful consideration as you refined the paper. Timelines for responding to critique are typically short. However, if this is a hardship, sending an e-mail to the editorial office is a good approach. Finally, it is extremely rare to have an article accepted without any revisions recommended. Similarly, the editors can choose to delay the acceptance of the paper until they can identify the authors' responsiveness to review. Although responding to review can be a new experience for developing authors, it serves to prepare the best possible article for readers and is well worth the work. CONCLUSION Applying evidence in everyday nursing practice is fundamental to professionalism, but it takes time and energy. Just like I needed a set of instructions to build the project with my daughter, I am hopeful that this set of directions will help you invest your time, talent, and energy to publish an EBP brief. When you publish your work you cease the opportunity to impact practice beyond what you provide on your own. By doing the hard work of writing and committing to the process of revising and refining, you also commit to improving neonatal practice for other nurses. It is our desire in the editorial office that you accept the challenge so that we can build better neonatal practice together! EDITORS' NOTE A Word of Thanks and Gratitude As we are nearing the end of our second year as coeditors we are celebrating the continued success of the journal. Part of that success was our very first Impact Factor announced in July. Advances in Neonatal Care's Impact Factor of 1.12 reflects the high quality of our manuscripts and places it 40 out of 108 nursing journals. A journal's Impact Factor comes primarily from the citation of the work (manuscripts) by other authors. In evaluation of the cited articles that contributed to our Impact Factor, EBP briefs played a significant role. In addition, the most cited ANC article during the years reviewed for establishing the impact factor was “Necrotizing Enterocolitis Risk State of the Science” by Dr Gephart and colleagues.30 Join us in congratulating Dr Gephart and all our journal authors!",

    "abstract": "FROM PREEMIE TO PRACTITIONER: A NEONATAL NURSE PRACTITIONER GRADUATE SHARES HER JOURNEYLindsay Griebling, MSN RN NNP, upon graduating from the Regis University MS in Nursing: Neonatal Nurse Practitioner Program“I feel indebted to the nurses and doctors that saved my life when I was a premature infant,” says Lindsay Griebling, MSN, RN, NNP, a member of the National Association of Neonatal Nurses (NANN) and the National Association of Neonatal Nurse Practitioners (NANNP). A 2015 graduate of Regis University's Master of Science in Nursing: Neonatal Nurse Practitioner program, Lindsay has a story to tell. The story begins with her premature birth and continues with her beginnings as a new neonatal nurse practitioner (NNP). Lindsay was born at 30 weeks' gestation weighing in at 830 g. Her mother had preeclampsia and so delivery of Lindsay by cesarean section at such an early gestation was necessary. Lindsay was intubated and had central lines placed. Fortunately, she was extubated the day after her birth to room air. She had what she terms as a “typical NICU course of increasing feedings and phototherapy.” Lindsay was in the hospital until just around her due date, transferring to a community hospital at 5 weeks of age. Lindsay's family has a legacy of nursing. Her grandmother was a nurse, and Lindsay remembers her as the kindest and most caring person she had ever known. She wanted to be just like her. Cementing that decision was an opportunity to volunteer in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) when she was in high school. Although she debated between becoming a pediatrician or a nurse, Lindsay worked closely with nurses during her volunteer time and ultimately felt her passion for nursing was sparked by that experience. Lindsay worked in several NICUs after becoming a nurse and NNPs were very present in those units. She discovered that she loved and appreciated their role and wanted to know more about the “why” behind practices rather than practicing in certain ways because “that was how it was always done.” Lindsay loved building a stronger knowledge base through her NNP degree program, which she says impacted her practice as a NICU nurse and as a new graduate nurse practitioner.Lindsay Griebling, 30 weeks' gestation premature infantWhen asked if her birth story and time in the NICU impacted her practice, Lindsay responded: I think my birth history has profoundly affected and impacted my practice. I deeply care for every patient I take care of and hopefully can provide the same experience that my family had while I was a patient in the NICU. As an intrauterine growth restriction infant myself, I relate to the premature infants and can share my story with parents and families, which I hope provides support and hope for their infant. Lindsay has traveled a unique journey from premature infant to NNP. She is excited to be embarking on her new career and looks to the NANN and the NANNP for help guiding her growth, advancing her education, and supporting her clinical practice. The National Association of Neonatal Nurses was a resource for her during her educational career, offering many resources such as journals, discussion boards, and educational opportunities. Lindsay looks forward to continuing her journey now as a new NNP attending NANN conferences and receiving support from NANNP to guide her transition from NICU nurse to NNP.

    "abstract": "JAUNDICE? YES, THERE IS AN APP FOR THAT Or at least, there soon will be. Clinical assessment of jaundice is a visual technique, so it was only a matter of time until someone applied smart phone technology to this common newborn problem. Parents with a newborn at home often detect that their infant's skin is turning yellow, but they have no way of knowing the significance without rushing their baby in to see the pediatrician. Researchers at the University of Washington are testing the BiliCam, an application that uses the smartphone's camera and flash, and a business card-sized color calibration card that adjusts for different lighting conditions.1 It works like this—the user enters some basic information such as date and time of birth. The color calibration card is placed on the baby's belly, and the user follows on-screen instructions to align the card on the app screen. The user presses the record button, and photos are taken with flash and ambient lighting, controlled by the app. These images are then sent to the cloud for analysis by machine-learning algorithms. Almost instantaneously, a result screen appears, showing the baby's bilirubin level and an indication of whether this is concerning or not (Figure).FigureBiliCam is a screening tool, designed to identify babies who might need a serum bilirubin level. It is not designed as a replacement for a serum bilirubin level. In 100 comparisons with serum bilirubin levels, the BiliCam performed as well as a transcutaneous bilirubinometer. The researchers plan to test BiliCam on up to 1000 additional newborns, especially those with darker skin pigments. The algorithms will then be robust enough to account for all ethnicities and skin colors. This could make BiliCam a useful tool for parents and healthcare workers in resource-poor countries, where jaundice accounts for many newborn deaths. BiliCam is not available yet, so do not go looking in the app store. The developers have filed for patents and plan to seek US Food and Drug Administration approval for the app. When it does become available, it is likely that the app itself will be free, but there will be a charge connected with the service to provide the bilirubin level. 1.

Most efforts in recent years have been devoted to preventing intubation, invasive ventilation, and oxygen overexposure, which is not always possible when trying to save lives. Corticosteroids and caffeine, as adjuncts to gentle ventilation strategies, are not without substantial adverse effects in this population. Now, ongoing research is using allogenic human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells to regenerate lung tissue and prevent the inflammatory response and lung tissue damage in preterm infants at high risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia. A cell-based product called PNEUMOSTEM (Medispost, Seoul, South Korea) will also begin phase 1/2 studies in the United States.1 Mesenchymal stem cells can be isolated from gestational tissues, such as the placenta, umbilical cord blood, Wharton's jelly, amniotic fluid, placenta, and the chorioamniotic membranes, all of which are typically discarded after birth.2 Because mesenchymal stem cells do not express the cell surface antigens that mediate graft-versus-host disease, they are less likely to be rejected.2 Researchers in Korea have been performing clinical trials of mesenchymal stem cells in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, finding that the therapy is safe and it reduces levels of proinflammatory cytokines.3 In an animal model, vascular endothelial growth factor secreted by intratracheally transplanted mesenchymal stem cells was found to be a critical factor in attenuating hyperoxic lung injury.4 Early work also suggests that mesenchymal stem cells can be used for neuroprotection in severe intraventricular hemorrhage and as a therapy for retinopathy of prematurity. 1.

Extremely premature infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) had fewer infections when staff donned gloves after washing their hands compared with handwashing alone in a randomized controlled trial. At the University of Virginia, 120 infants less than 8 days of age were enrolled in a study to see whether wearing nonsterile gloves after handwashing and before all direct patient care, compared with handwashing alone, would prevent late-onset infections or necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants with birthweights less than 1000 g or gestational age of less than 29 weeks. Late-onset invasive infection or necrotizing enterocolitis occurred in 32% of infants (19 of 60) in the gloving group compared with 45% of infants (27 of 60) in the handwashing only group.1 There were also 53% fewer gram-positive bloodstream infections and 64% fewer central line-associated bloodstream infections in the gloving group than the handwashing only group. Gloving likely reduced infections because handwashing does not eliminate all microorganisms from the caregiver's hands. But it is already fairly common for nurses (who provide most of the hands-on care) to wear clean gloves during contact with infants (changing diapers, suctioning, bathing, feeding, handling intravenous lines, etc) because the risk for exposure to blood or body fluids is relatively ubiquitous. In fact, it is rare to provide direct care without wearing clean gloves or sterile gloves, depending on the situation. This study suggests that putting on clean gloves after handwashing is important not just for protecting the caregiver from exposure to the infant's blood or body fluids, but also to protect the infant from transmission of microorganisms that remain on the hands following hand hygiene. However, universal gloving could have a negative effect on hand hygiene rates by encouraging caregivers to skip hand hygiene altogether, if they assume that wearing gloves is just as good. If that happens, it is likely to defeat the purpose of wearing gloves because caregivers will transfer microorganisms from their unwashed hands to the surface of the gloves when they are putting them on and contaminate the gloves remaining in the box. 1. Kaufman DA, Blackman A, Conaway MR, Sinkin RA. Nonsterile glove use in addition to hand hygiene to prevent late-onset infection in preterm infants: randomized clinical trial. JAMA Pediatr. 2014;168(10):909–916. SINGLE-USE ONLY SYRINGES BY 2017 Sometimes, it is easier to change technology than behavior. Proper infection control practice has been recommending for many years that health care providers avoid reusing syringes for different, or even the same, patient. Despite this recommendation, some healthcare providers continue to reuse syringes, putting patients at high risk for bloodborne and other infections. Both cost and convenience have been cited as reasons for these unsafe practices. By the year 2017, it will longer be possible to reuse a syringe. A new type of syringe will be in use, which has an autodisable mechanism to prevent reuse. A small ring etched on the inside of the barrel allows the specifically adapted plunger to move in 1 direction but not the other. After 1 complete injection is given, the plunger will automatically lock in place, so the plunger cannot be pulled back to refill the syringe. If forced, the syringe mechanism will break, rendering the syringe useless. This device has been licensed to 13 worldwide syringe manufacturers. The World Health Organization is expected to issue a mandate directing health care providers worldwide to adopt autodisable syringes.1 1. Frellick M. WHO Mandates New Single-Use Syringe.

COACHING PARENTS THROUGH THE HOME STRETCH The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality offers a toolkit for facilitating a smooth, safe, and family-centered transition from the NICU to home. The toolkit is based on the Safe Passages Project from Texas Children's Hospital and incorporates the Health Coach model. “Transitioning Newborns from NICU to Home: A Resource Toolkit” is available online (http://www.ahrq.gov/professionals/systems/hospital/nicu_toolkit/nicutoolkit.pdf). The manual is designed to be adapted for any institution that cares for fragile newborn infants. The Health Coach is a skilled, sensitive professional who helps families to become competent and confident caregivers who can advocate for the needs of their infant. Thus, the role of the health coach is as an educator, not as a caregiver. The background of the health coach can be in nursing, social work, or health education. The health coach serves as a teacher, facilitator, and coach, remaining sensitive to parent/caregiver needs as they enact all these roles. This connection, void of bedside clinician responsibilities, offers the parent/caretaker an environment to openly express their fears or concerns that will ultimately create an improved partnership with the direct care providers. The manual provides a full description of the roles and responsibilities of the health coach. The toolkit Web site (http://www.ahrq.gov/nicutoolkit) includes a list of program resources, such as a Family Information Packet, which is customized to the needs of the individual infant and family, a NICU needs assessment and a plan for follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Choosing the title for this editorial was easy because in our varied roles we hear this comment all the time, “writing is just not for me! Other people do that; they think it's easy, but not me.” Students, staff nurses, and even advanced practice nurses often truly hate the idea of writing. For many of us, the idea of writing does not bring up positive thoughts.1 However, writing does not need to be a horrible process, and it is an important process for many reasons. Writing provides an opportunity to reflect about patients and events in your work environment or practice. Writing also provides a way to more deeply explore a particular topic or issue. For example, while working with an infant and a family and uncovering the pathophysiology that accompanies trisomy 21, writing about it can make all the pieces come together more clearly and provides an avenue for you to share your knowledge with others. The best way for novice writers to engage in the writing process is to find something he or she is passionate about. Finding your passion is important because the passion about a topic or an issue will help you stick with the writing process even when the going gets a little tough. Just remember to take one step at a time. You can make it happen; it is truly that easy! STEP 1 Let's begin by defining passion. Passion, according to the Oxford English Dictionary is “an intense desire or enthusiasm for something.”2 Passion often drives or motivates action. Let's imagine that you have decided it is time to try your hand at writing a manuscript for Advances in Neonatal Care; choosing the topic will be your first step. Was there recently a baby in your unit that had a syndrome that stumped everyone? Is there a pathophysiology issue or discharge problem that you want to learn more about because you seem to keep caring for these types of infants? Is there an area of neonatal nursing where you have become the expert in your unit and you have expertise to share with others? Is there a policy or procedure guideline in your unit that you believe is not evidence-based or needs updating? Is there a project or research you were involved with on your unit that had great results that you want to share with others? Identifying your passion will sustain you even if your enthusiasm is dampened by challenges along the way. STEP 2 Once you choose the general topic, begin by writing down everything you currently know about the topic or project. You can write your ideas in outline form or even just a list that you can arrange later in the process into an outline. You might also write down why this topic is important to you in 1-2 sentences or a list of ideas. Understanding why the topic is important to you will help you to convey that importance to the reader. When we are writing, we often keep a note pad nearby to add ideas to the topic list that come into our minds randomly over the course of the day. These ideas are often quite valuable to the writing process. Some writers use their phone to voice record their ideas and others add notes to their calendars (paper or electronic). Regardless of the method you use, maintaining your running list of ideas so you will have them later when you have the time to reflect and write will help you continue to formulate your thoughts around your topic. Finding a process of keeping your ideas organized or together is important for moving forward in the writing process. Writing is like most everything—when it becomes more of a habit it is easier to do.3–4 We would encourage you do consider reading the book by Silva4How to Write a Lot. We like this text because it is a quick read, uses humor, and has thoughtful strategies that work to help you examine the writing process and make good decisions about how best to keep going in the process. Others use writing strategies from the book by Boice3 on professional writing or the book by Oerrmann and Hayes5 on writing in nursing. These are all excellent resources to use when you might be struggling with the writing process. However, we also want to emphasize that using these resources is not mandatory to support you in the writing process. You need to decide what will best help you stay motivated and develop habits that will keep you writing. The best strategy is to write something, anything every day. Silva3 suggests that you find a consistent time and place to write daily. Some of our colleagues write in the office, some only at home, and some in coffee shops; what you need to do is find a place that works for you. STEP 3 Now you are ready to take your list of ideas and thoughts about your topic and go to the current literature. Many nurses have access to a medical library to search for current medical and nursing literature through their institution; medical centers and universities will have purchased the licenses to get access to most journals. If not, PubMed is available free on the Internet; however, getting to the whole article can be a little more difficult without licensed access. Many schools of nursing will assist you with getting access to a university library as a thank you for precepting or being an adjunct faculty member. Many nurses do not realize they can ask for this privilege as part of providing those opportunities for student nurses. Beware if you choose to use the Internet to search about your topic. Always consider the source: Is it a reliable source (supported by an appropriate organization)? Do you know when it was last updated? We will talk more about searching in a later editorial, but there are several sources you can use to help you in this process, including a medical librarian.6 Having an understanding of the kind of evidence there is to support your topic is important to your next steps. We cannot emphasize enough how important reading the literature and using it to support your ideas is to the writing process. STEP 4 Once you have your topic and information from the literature (evidence), the next step will be deciding what kind of manuscript you will write. This decision may be related to the topic (clinical issue, disease process, or report of unit project). Choosing the style of the manuscript will provide you with a framework or structure for helping your topic to hang together cohesively. Later in this series, we will provide more detailed guidance about writing clinical manuscripts as opposed to research manuscripts, however, included in the reference list are 3 short articles that provide some direction for selection of manuscript style.7–9 The next decision you want to make is where you want to publish the manuscript. Selecting a journal is an important decision because the journal will provide additional guidance about manuscript structure. Every journal provides guidance about how to best structure manuscripts for publication in that journal. Following the directions is important to your success in the process. STEP 5 By the time you are selecting a journal, you will have retrieved and read the literature about your topic and the next step is to consider how you think your manuscript will add to the literature. Taking the ideas and thoughts you have already written and putting them into an outline form that follows the structure provided by the journal will help you see what aspects are already well refined and areas where more refinement in your ideas is needed. No one likes blank pages, so writing an outline will help you see the structure of what you need to follow to fill those pages. What will you provide the reader of your manuscript that others have not? How will you speak about your audience so your message will be heard? These are questions that should guide your work during this aspect of the writing process. At this point in the discussion, we would like to speak to publishing in Advances in Neonatal Care (ANC). Advances in Neonatal Care is the journal of the National Association of Neonatal Nurses. We believe that it is the premier journal for guiding neonatal nursing practice; however, it cannot be that without the work of neonatal nurses. We believe that your work will truly impact neonatal nursing practice if published in our journal. We hope you agree and will choose ANC to share your expertise. Our vision is to see ANC referred to regularly by neonatal nurses for the evidence that guides their practice. Publishing in a nursing journal strengthens nursing knowledge and helps guide nursing practice. We truly want each of you to be successful in the writing process, so we are willing to mentor you in the writing process. Send us e-mails with your ideas; we will encourage your submissions. Another strategy is finding a mentor in your neonatal nursing community to help you strengthen your writing skills. Writing can be lonely and most writers do not write alone so finding someone to share the work with you could be a strategy that will keep you moving forward with the writing process. Finally, we welcome your comments and hope you will communicate openly with us about what you see in these editorials and your expectations for the journal. Send us questions or tell us writing strategies that have worked for you; we will use these editorials to share your strategies with your neonatal nursing colleagues. We are looking forward to working with each of you. Please consider submitting your scholarly work to ANC; we are committed to supporting both new and seasoned authors. We know that if you keep going, very soon you will see your name in print in Advances in Neonatal Care! Thank you for your support, Jacqueline M.

    "abstract": "The Standard for Maintaining the Competence of Neonatal Nurse Practitioners (2015) is a revision that updates the 2010 statement. As the professional voice of neonatal nurse practitioners (NNPs), the National Association of Neonatal Nurse Practitioners (NANNP) recognizes the need to remain relevant and responsible in setting standards for NNP practice. This statement presents the most current recommendations for maintaining and demonstrating continued NNP competence. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE The American Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP) and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommend that nurse practitioners make a commitment to lifelong learning, professional development, and quality improvement.1,2 NNP practice requires specialized knowledge and skills to ensure safe, high-quality care for patients and families. In accordance with the AANP and IOM recommendations, NNPs must demonstrate a continued focus on education and development over the course of their careers. A formal method of demonstrating continued competence is necessary. HIGHLIGHTS OF UPDATES The Recommendations section was updated to include NANN's position on the acceptance of simulation and procedural review as well as actual performance of procedures as evidence of continued competence demonstration.3 CONCLUSIONS As the professional voice of neonatal nurses and NNPs, both NANN and NANNP recommend that NNPs regularly undergo evaluation on the core competencies within the 7 domains identified in NANN's Education Standards and Curriculum Guidelines for Neonatal Nurse Practitioner Programs.3 Maintenance of competence can be documented in a variety of ways.

    "abstract": "INTERNATIONAL CODE STATUS REPORT FOR 2016 The World Health Organization, United Nations Children's Emergency Fund, and the International Baby Food Action Network joined forces back in the late 1970s to facilitate women breastfeeding through legislative measures and social action initiatives. Part of the legislative measures includes reducing promotions for infant formula, nipples, and bottles, all that help replace breast milk.1 The International Code continues promoting exclusive breastfeeding for several reasons: (a) children who are breastfed for longer periods have lower infectious morbidity and mortality; (b) children who are breastfed have fewer dental malocclusions; (c) children who are breastfed have higher intelligence than those who are breastfed for shorter periods or those who are not breastfed; (d) breastfeeding can prevent breast cancer in the mother; (e) breastfeeding can improve birth spacing; (f) breastfeeding might reduce the mother's risk of diabetes and ovarian cancer; (g) and scaling up breastfeeding can prevent an estimated 823,000 child deaths and 20,000 breast cancer deaths every year.2 The overarching aim of the Code is to contribute to safe and adequate nutrition for infants and young children ensuring that breast milk substitutes are appropriately marketed and distributed to the public through legislative monitoring.1 To demonstrate support of the Code, countries implement provisions within the law to protect breastfeeding and provide regulations for substitutes to exclusive breastfeeding (eg, infant formula, nipples, and bottles).3 A total of 135 of 194 countries reported some or all portions of the Code implemented, which has increased by 32 countries since 2011. Identified barriers to adoption of the Code are as follows: (a) lack of political interest; (b) formula, nipples, and bottle company interests; and (c) limited knowledge and lack of resources to implement, monitor, and reinforce. Interestingly, the developed countries such as the United States, Japan, and Australia have not implemented any portion of the Code compared with developing countries such as India, the Philippines, and many African companies that have the full Code as law to facilitate a reduction in infant formula and promotion of breastfeeding.3 With all of the known benefits of exclusive breastfeeding, adoption of the Code in developed countries could only strengthen our youth and the future of our country. ZIKA VIRUS AND THE NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT The 2016 Summer Olympics hosted by Rio has brought most of the world's attention to Zika virus. Zika virus disease is acquired through a mosquito-borne virus (usually Aedes species). The common symptoms experienced are fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis.4 In general, the symptoms are self-limiting in adults; however, the virus can be transmitted to the fetus, in which dire consequences can be realized. Researchers have confirmed a causal relationship between prenatal Zika virus infection and microcephaly, as well as other serious brain anomalies in neonates.5 Zika virus has also been linked to placental insufficiency and fetal growth restriction.6 Zika virus can be spread from human to human through blood and semen.7 Initially, the virus was isolated to South America; however, it is no longer contained. Puerto Rico (a territory of the United States) has been declared a site for mosquito transmission.8 Being a site for mosquito transmission means mosquitos carrying Zika virus have been discovered in the area and are spreading the virus to humans. In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now has recommendations about how to reduce the risk of transmitting Zika virus to a fetus. Women and men who traveled to Zika virus–infected area but did not experience any symptoms of the virus need to wait at least 8 weeks before trying to get pregnant to minimize the risk of transmitting Zika virus. Women who have symptoms of the virus or test positive for Zika virus need to wait at least 8 weeks after their symptoms first appeared before trying to get pregnant. For men who had symptoms, they should wait 6 months before having unprotected sex because the virus lives in semen for a prolonged period.9 The first US death has been reported of an American woman living in Puerto Rico who miscarried her fetus during the second trimester due to complications from Zika virus–related brain damage.10 The state of New York is also increasing its screening for Zika virus by offering free testing to pregnant women who have traveled to affected countries, whether they have symptoms or not.11 The difficulties that face neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) nurses regarding Zika virus are tremendous and likely to an extent that is unknown. If or when the virus becomes more prominent in the United States, we will have to realize that some of these birth defects may not be detected until late in pregnancy, which will make the decision for an abortion a limited option in some states. Thus, the parents may present to the NICU with attachment problems, a lack of desire to keep the infant and give him or her up for adoption, and extreme distress over the potential problems they foresee their family facing in the future.12 Currently, medical care recommendations for infants who may have been exposed to Zika virus is determined explicitly on the presence or absence of microcephaly.13,14 Infants need a complete physical examination, with a measurement of head circumference, length, weight, and gestational age assessment that includes a detailed neurologic examination.15 Guidance for measuring an infant's head for microcephaly is available,14 using the qualifier of 32 cm or less at birth of a term infant as the reference value for defining microcephaly.15 In addition, within the first month, an infant with microcephaly needs to have an ophthalmologic evaluation since ophthalmologic findings such as macular abnormalities and optic nerve disorders are reported in infants with microcephaly with possible congenital infection.15 Zika virus has been shown to be present in breast milk; however, no infant to date has been infected via this transmission method.16 Therefore, proceeding forward with promoting breastfeeding is recommended. The National Association of Neonatal Nurses' Web site has updated links to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization for the latest guidance on Zika virus (available at: http://nann.org/5-zika). KEEPING YOURSELF HEALTHY Efficacy is important to us as nurses when caring for our patients. It is also critical in helping us maintain a healthy lifestyle that includes exercise. Luckily, researchers have designed an exercise program that showed similar improvement in cardiometabolic health in sprint interval training compared with traditional endurance training, in which the sprint interval training was 5 times lower exercise volume and 5 times lower time commitment.17 In the sprint interval training session, the participant is involved in 1 minute of intense intermittent exercise within a 10-minute session. The group in the moderate-intensity continuous training (traditional endurance) exercised for 50 minutes with moderate-intensity continuous exercise. The participants were 19 sedentary men, who participated in 3 sessions of exercise per week for a total of 12 weeks, with the amount of exercise dependent on their randomly assigned group. The results indicated that both sprint interval training and moderate-intensity continuous exercise were significantly improved from the controls in measures of peak oxygen uptake, insulin sensitive index, and skeletal muscle mitochondrial content. Overall, these results demonstrate that both forms of exercise are beneficial to improving cardiometabolic health compared with not doing any exercise. In addition, it showed that 10 minutes of exercise with a minute of intense exercise is equally as effective as 50 minutes of moderate-intensity continuous training 3 times per week over a 12-week period. Therefore, not including exercising for cardiometabolic health reasons is no longer an excuse with only needing 10 minutes. Take care of yourself! You care for so many people during the day, night, and on holidays. Make sure to reserve time for yourself. Even if it is only 10 minutes.",

    "abstract": "I always did something I was a little not ready to do. I think that is how you grow. When there is that moment of “wow, I am not really sure I can do this,” and you push through, those moments, that is when you have a breakthrough. Sometimes that's a sign that something really good is about to happen. You're about to grow and learn a lot about yourself. Marissa Meyer1 Whether you are a New Year's resolution type of person or a not, we each seek something out of life. We each have a dream. Some dreams are big, others might fit more in the “great things come in small packages” size. Regardless, it is hard not to let the New Year arrive without pausing to look at what was a part of our previous year and what we might want to be in the year ahead. We have the opportunity to let go of what did not serve us and to make room for new things, and embrace possibilities. At this time in my life, I seem to be collecting “I am not really ready for this” moments. This past year I completed a Yoga Teacher Training Program and, shortly thereafter, moved from the sunny beaches of Southern California across the country to start a PhD program. I ended the year by bringing home a new puppy. None of these happened by chance, but on the first day of each journey, I certainly did think I was not quite ready. I am so grateful I pushed through. I have learned a lot and really good things are happening. In this New Year, I encourage each of you to try something you might be “a little not ready to do.” Maybe you will try yoga, take a class, or adopt a puppy. I would like to suggest that you write a case study and submit it to Advances in Neonatal Care. You might feel a little not ready, but hopefully, if you read on, I will convince you otherwise. To begin, let us define a case study. I suggest that a case study is a story. We all love stories. Why? Stories connect us, inspire us, encourage us, and challenge us. Stories give meaning to what we do. The story you share has infinite possibilities, but only if you share it. Your story may inspire change, a new practice, or new research, or it may be the missing puzzle piece to someone's research. It may give hope to a struggling family. By sharing a story—a case study—you empower and humanize the experience of the healthcare team, the infant, and the family. I will provide some helpful practical tools, but first I want to encourage you to start by writing the story without format and without guidelines. Yes, we want to know all the facts, numbers, data, etc, but what makes the case or story memorable is why you remember it, why it is important to share. We want the heart and passion of the story—the part that connects us together as one team that learns and grows from our collective experiences. Tell us how it changed you and the team taking care of that infant and the family. What did you do differently? What do you wish you would have known that will help others take care of a similar infant in the future? Now that you have the heart of the story in mind, pull out the guidelines for publication. CASE OF THE MONTH GUIDELINES The case of the month article could include a presentation of a unique clinical issue, an atypical presentation or outcome of a common disease, an infant with a diagnostic challenge, an unusual disease process, a unique social or ethical challenge, or a challenging transport case. The general structure for the case of the month manuscript may be as follows: Introduction, Case Presentation, Discussion, and Conclusion. You may choose to also include the family perspective. Introduction: The goal of the introduction is to provide a brief background including the disease/disorder/diagnosis, with concise explanation of presentation and progression. First, provide a very brief literature review. Then give a brief introduction to the case report with clear explanation of the topic to be discussed. End with a very short statement of what is being reported in the case presentation. Be concise. Have enough information to interest the reader but not so much that you would skip reading the entire article. Case presentation: This is the story; provide all the details of the case. Include birth history/maternal history as appropriate for the case, followed by presenting signs and symptoms, initial workup, treatment, and interventions. If many systems are involved, you might want to break up the presentation into subsections. Tell this part of the story in a concise manner and in a chronological order. Include physical examination(s), vital signs, studies, and results. Include medical and social collaboration and referrals. Be sure to stay close to the theme presented without straying or adding confusing information not relevant to the case/diagnosis. Discussion: Here you can include the related anatomy/physiology or pathophysiology and compare/contrast this case with what is known in the current literature. You should also discuss the impact of the knowledge gained in this case to the field of nursing? How can this knowledge change practice in the neonatal intensive care unit and what family considerations should be addressed? Are there special considerations for discharge and follow-up, and/or recommendations for community resources? Finally, include any teaching points for both the nursing staff and the family. Conclusion: Summarize the main conclusions and the primary and significant findings and clearly state their importance and relevance. Emphasize the clinical significance. Answer, how will knowledge of this case advance practice? Define and state clearly the take-home messages, and incorporate the heart and passion for your story into the final ending. The family perspective (optional): If the family is available and willing, allow them to share their point of view/experience. Give a voice to the patient/family side and let the family tell the story. Once you have put together your entire story, review it according to the rule of “C's.” Is it clear, concise, coherent, compassionate, and competent? Then ask a trusted colleague to read it and give you feedback. As a nurse you have the opportunity to care for one patient at a time. I encourage you to tell one story at a time. Speak for our littlest patients who do not yet have a voice to share their own story. Be their voice. I hope that this year you will find the courage to consider “something [you are] a little not ready to do.” Here in Advances in Neonatal Care, we have the opportunity to share a story in the Case of the Month section. I encourage you to be the storyteller. I encourage you to push through.

    "abstract": "NEW POSITION STATEMENT As healthcare models evolve, there is an increasing demand for continuous evaluation of neonatal nurse practitioner (NNP)–driven outcome measures as a professional practice requirement.1,2 To accomplish this goal, NNPs must show continuous quality improvement (QI) by participating, directing, and developing performance metrics. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Historically, establishing provider outcome comparisons was critical to demonstrate both the safety and efficacy of nurse practitioner care.3–5 In the current practice environment, outcome measures specific to the NNP must now be incorporated into professional requirements to continue to prove the value of NNP care and contribution to measurable outcomes.1,2 Developing these outcome evaluation tools and processes will assist in the benchmarking and validation of care provided by NNPs. HIGHLIGHTS Developing and choosing the appropriate outcome metrics for NNPs are challenging. The majority of neonatal patient care outcomes are the result of the collaborative efforts of multiple healthcare providers, along with family members who provide care. As part of the healthcare team, NNPs need to be well informed about the outcomes specific to their practice. Unfortunately, despite the fact that NNPs are perfectly positioned to drive QI, they often lack the education and preparation to do so. Basic QI education should be included in current and future nursing programs so that graduating NNPs will be prepared for these new requirements. CONCLUSIONS As the professional voice of neonatal nurses, the National Association of Neonatal Nurses recommends that every NNP should be aware of and participate in multidisciplinary or interprofessonal QI. In addition, NNPs should track and evaluate outcomes relevant to their practice and be aware of measurable metrics relating to the outcomes of the patients for whom they provide care.

    "abstract": "In this editorial, we take the opportunity to celebrate the long-term leadership of two of our distinguished neonatal colleagues and long-term editorial board members for Advances in Neonatal Care (ANC), welcome 2 new leaders to our ANC team, and challenge each of you to consider your leadership potential. As neonatal nurses, we want you to think about how you will give back to your profession. Everyone can be a leader and serve the profession. However, you will need to seize your opportunity to serve the neonatal community. You can be a leader if you choose to do so. Whether your chair a committee on your unit, volunteer to be on a taskforce for NANN, or demonstrate your expertise to others who want to emulate you, you are a leader. There are many leaders, both formal and informal. Formal leaders, such as mangers, occupy a position of authority and responsibility, whereas informal leaders hold a position of influence as a result of their expertise, ability to build relationships, and advance the work of others. Individuals often perceive leadership opportunities as unattainable because the formal leadership positions are already filled or the informal leaders are strong and therefore additional leaders are not viewed as needed. However, new formal and informal leaders should be in continuous development to avoid a gap in leadership. Current and future leaders must recognize the importance of succession planning by promoting the leadership potential of each individual. Regardless of your current status, evaluate your leadership path. Each of you has an ability to contribute to your neonatal profession, and we look forward to watching your progress. SAYING GOODBYE AND THANK YOU With gratitude for their service, we are saying goodbye to 2 long-standing members of the ANC editorial board: Laura Stokowski, MS, RN: We hope you recognized the absence of our “Noteworthy Professional News” column in our last issue of ANC. After 13 years of service as the primary contributor for Noteworthy Professional News, Laura Stokowski, MS, RN, resigned her position on the editorial board. Ms Stokowski's dedication to the journal was unrivaled, and her consistent contributions to Noteworthy Professional News were always viewed by the NANN membership as an essential component to our journal. In the 4th issue 2015, Ms Stokowski also served as the guest editor for our special issue focused on rare neonatal diseases, one area of her expertise. While Ms Stokowski will not be consistently contributing to ANC, she remains a leader in neonatal nursing in her new role with Medscape. We wish her all the best in her new endeavors and thank her for her significant contribution to our journal for the past 13 years. Anita Catlin, DNSc, FNP, RN, FAAN: Dr Catlin has been a member of the ANC editorial board for more than 10 years and has served as the section editor for Ethical Issues in Neonatal Care since its inception. Dr Catlin is a pioneer in the ethical care of high-risk infants, and she consults in the United States and abroad on neonatal end-of-life care. Dr Catlin's clinical practice and research has significantly impacted how families are cared for before, during, and following delivery of an infant with a lethal anomaly, and we have been fortunate to have her as a member of our team. While officially retired, Dr Catlin remains busy with her work at Kaiser Research and Redesign and her family. We wish her a long and fulfilling retirement. WELCOME ABOARD We are excited to welcome 2 new members to the ANC editorial board: Ms Patricia Clifford, MS, RN-NIC: Ms Clifford is a long-time advanced practice nurse leader from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Her experience as both a neonatal educator and a clinical nurse specialist will bring a wealth of clinical expertise to the board. Ms Clifford's will provide regular contributions to Noteworthy Professional News responsibilities column. Haifa Samra, PhD, MSIM, RN-NIC, CNL: Dr Samra is a neonatal nurse scientist and Associate Chair of Research for Nursing and Public Health at the University of South Dakota. Throughout her career, Dr Samra has mentored neonatal nurses from novice to expert and has expertise in clinical practice, education, and research. She is well qualified to assume her role as the new section editor for the Professional Growth and Development. We hope you will welcome both of our new board members. Finally, we want to thank current board members, Kathy Ahern, PhD, RN, and Heather Smith, PhD, RN, for agreeing to accept new responsibilities. Dr Ahern will transition from section editor of Professional Growth and Development to be section editor for Ethical Issues in Neonatal Care. Dr Smith will assume joint responsibility for Noteworthy Professional News with Ms Clifford. Thanks to all neonatal nurse leaders who contribute to the care of our infants and families. We hope you will give thought to how you can lead your profession today and in the future. If you are interested in opportunities as an author, reviewer, or ANC editorial board member, please let us know.

    "abstract": "OUT WITH THE OLD TERM-INOLOGY Perinatal healthcare professionals have traditionally used the word “term” to apply to infants born from 3 weeks before until 2 weeks after the 40-week gestation mark. Infants born during this 5-week span were generally thought to have the same good outcomes. However, the evidence increasingly shows that lumping all of these infants together is not appropriate, because the outcomes of infants born 3 weeks before “term” (37 weeks) can be significantly different from those born at 40 weeks. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee on Obstetric Practice and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine convened a workgroup to consider the definition of the termpregnancy.1 This group recommends that the label “term” be replaced with the following designations: Early term: 37 weeks through 38 weeks and 6 days; Full term: 39 weeks through 40 weeks and 6 days; Late term: 41 weeks through 41 weeks and 6 days; and Postterm: 42 weeks and older. The full committee opinion, “Definition of Term Pregnancy,” is available on the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist's Web site at http://www.acog.org/Resources_And_Publications/Committee_Opinions/Committee_on_Obstetric_Practice/Definition_of_Term_Pregnancy. For the best possible care and communication between neonatal, obstetric, and pediatric providers, it is important to have uniformity in the terminology used to characterize our patients. Use of the same language will also improve conformity in clinical research and public health reporting of birth statistics and outcomes. Neonatal nurses should endeavor to adopt the new, more specific terminology when speaking or documenting the care of the newborn. 1. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

RETHINKING PRIVATE NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT ROOMS Private rooms for infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) have become common, almost becoming a standard of care. Many benefits for infants and families were anticipated, such as reduced exposure to noise and light, more privacy, more space, and improved infection control. We did not necessarily need a lot of studies to tell us that private rooms were better for the babies. Or, did we? A recent study1 calls into question the commonsense view that private rooms are better for infants than the traditional ward-style NICU. This particular study evaluated associations between NICU room type (open ward and private room) and medical outcomes; neurobehavior, electrophysiology, and brain structure at hospital discharge; and developmental outcomes of the infants at 2 years of age. This prospective longitudinal cohort study enrolled 136 preterm infants (<30 weeks' gestation) from an urban, 75-bed level III NICU from 2007 to 2010. Each infant was admitted to a bed space in an open ward (containing 8-12 beds) or private room (according to space and staffing availability) and remained in that room for the duration of hospitalization. It was standard practice in the NICU to dim overhead lights, cover incubators, and attempt to minimize noise. The primary outcome was developmental performance at 2 years of age (86 infants returned for testing, which was 83% of the survivors). Secondary outcomes included neurobehavior and cerebral maturation assessed by magnetic resonance imaging and amplitude-integrated electroencephalography. They found that at term equivalent age, the private room infants showed reduced normal hemispheric asymmetry and a trend toward lower amplitude-integrated electroencephalography cerebral maturation scores (P = .02). At the age of 2 years, private room infants had lower language scores (P = .006), a difference that was even more pronounced in infants with moderate-severe cerebral injury. Private room infants also exhibited a trend toward lower motor scores (P = .02) and significantly higher arousability scores than open ward infants. The investigators concluded that their findings highlight the need for further research into the potential adverse effects of different amounts of sensory exposure in the NICU environment. They raise the possibility that the relative “sensory deprivation” of a private room might explain the differences in the study groups. They acknowledge that parental visiting and holding in their urban NICU might have been below average, although controlling for parental visitation and holding in the NICU, did not alter the findings. Still, it is impossible to know from this study whether higher levels of parental interaction, particularly vocalization, might be able to counteract the relative sensory deprivation of a private room. 1.

J Pediatr. PEDIATRIC PALLIATIVE CARE Pediatric palliative care programs are becoming more common in children's hospitals, a positive development. A recent survey1 found that approximately 70% of children's hospitals have pediatric palliative care programs, although there is marked variation in how the programs operate, suggesting a need for formal guidance on how to deliver high-quality pediatric palliative care. A new guideline from the American Academy of Pediatrics2 is a timely and welcome response to this need. The goal of pediatric palliative care is to relieve suffering, improve quality of life, facilitate informed decision-making, and assist in care coordination. It should be patient-centered and family engaged, respecting and partnering with patients and families. Among the principles of high-quality pediatric palliative care outlined in the guidance document are the following: Hospitals and health care organizations that frequently care for children with life-threatening illness and routinely provide end-of-life care should have dedicated interdisciplinary specialty teams to address physical, psychosocial, emotional, practical, and spiritual needs of the child and family. Palliative/hospice care should involve various modes of integrated care: cure-seeking, life-prolonging (when in the child's best interest), and comfort-enhancing. Specialists should facilitate clear, compassionate discussions with patients and families and support them through the process. Psychological and bereavement counselors should be available to help siblings express their thoughts and emotions. All health care professionals should be supported via peer-to-peer discussions, debriefings, and other counseling and educational programs. Institutional policies should address ethical considerations on topics such as withdrawal of life-sustaining medical treatment and the relief of severe symptoms. 1.

The clinical nurse leader (CNL) is a master's educated nurse, prepared for practice across the continuum of care within any health care setting in today's changing health care environment. According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, which originally developed the role, a CNL oversees the care coordination of a distinct group of patients and actively provides direct patient care in complex situations. The CNL puts evidence-based practice into action to ensure that patients benefit from the latest innovations in care delivery. The CNL evaluates patient outcomes, assesses cohort risk, and has the decision-making authority to change care plans when necessary. The CNL is a leader in the healthcare delivery system, and the implementation of this role will vary across settings. A new document from the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, Competency and Curricular Expectations for Clinical Nurse Leader Education and Practice, delineates the entry-level competencies for all CNLs. The document also includes a curriculum framework and clinical/practice expectations for CNL programs. These components provide the basis for the design and implementation of a master's or postmaster's CNL education program and prepare the graduate to sit for the Commission on Nurse Certification CNL Certification Examination. PREVENTING CLABSI: TAKE OUT THE PICC A new study1 suggests that a good strategy to prevent central line–associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) in neonates is to remove the catheter after no longer than 2 weeks, if possible. To assess the daily risk for CLABSIs associated with catheter dwell time, Milstone and colleagues1 conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study looking at 3967 patients who had a total of 4797 peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) placed between 2005 and 2013. Of 89,946 catheter-days, 149 CLABSIs were diagnosed (incidence 1.66 per 1000 catheter-days). In adjusted analysis, the average predicted daily risk for CLABSI after PICC insertion increased during the first 2 weeks after PICC insertion and remained elevated for the dwell time of the catheter. Dwell times longer than 2 weeks were associated with a higher risk for CLABSI than shorter dwell times. CLABSI risk was increased in neonates with concurrent PICCs, and the incidence of gram-negative CLABSIs was higher in PICCs with dwell times greater than 50 days. The researchers recommend that clinicians should review PICC necessity daily, optimize catheter maintenance practices, and investigate novel CLABSI-prevention strategies in PICCs with prolonged dwell times. 1.

    "abstract": "NEW COCHAIR FOR THE HEALTH POLICY AND ADVOCACY COMMITTEEFigureMy name is Julie Sundermeier and I live just outside of Omaha, Nebraska. I have been married for nearly 35 years to my husband Mark, and we have 4 children and 6 grandchildren. I am the lead neonatal nurse practitioner (NNP) at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, and I am blessed to work with a terrific team of nurse practitioners. When I am not working, I enjoy gardening, traveling, and spending time with family and friends. I have been to Haiti on 4 medical mission trips and love working with the Haitian midwives, mothers, and babies. I started my nursing career in 1984; I was fortunate to work per diem while my 4 children were young. Initially, I worked in a variety of hospital settings, eventually taking a position and finding my home in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). I found the NICU to be both challenging and rewarding, and I had terrific mentors along the way. I worked nights for 10 years in a level III NICU before going back to school to become an NNP, and recently returned to school, graduating in 2012 with my doctorate of nursing practice. It was during this time that I developed an interest in advocacy; however, as a novice to all things legislative, my learning curve was steep. I was fortunate to be awarded the NANN scholarship for the Nurse in Washington Internship and attended the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses' Student Summit in Washington, District of Columbia. My degree capstone project was facilitating the passage of a bill in Nebraska that removed limitations on ordering respiratory care therapy due to outdated legislation. After completing my degree, I became a member of the NANN Health Policy and Advocacy Committee (HPAC) and have served on the committee for 3 years. I also serve on the Legislative Committee for Nebraska Nurse Practitioners. I am proud to say that Nebraska became the 20th state to have full practice authority after passing legislation last year. We continue to work to remove barriers and improve access to care for the citizens in Nebraska. As a cochair for the HPAC, I would like to engage NANN members to be knowledgeable about issues and get involved in advocacy. The committee will follow legislation that affects neonates and the nurses who care for them. We will continue to communicate information on MyNANN discussion posts and take part in the NANN annual conference. I look forward to working with my cochair and the HPAC members to develop new advocacy projects and grow our NANN advocacy community. NEW FACILITATOR FOR THE SURGICAL NEONATE SPECIAL INTEREST GROUP My name is Tamara (Tammie) Meeker, and I joined NANN while working as a staff nurse at the University of Maryland Health Systems in Baltimore, Maryland. This is where my true passion for the surgical neonate was born. I had the great fortune to be trained by an incredible core group of neonatal nurses specializing in the surgical neonate. They helped form my foundation and knowledge base—something for which I am forever grateful and have been building on ever since. In 2003, I graduated from the University of Maryland's School of Nursing NNP program and began working at The John Hopkin's Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, as both a transport nurse and a nurse practitioner. In 2006, I transitioned to my current role as an NNP for the general, thoracic, and fetal surgery team at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I still live in Philadelphia with my dog Sadie. As an NNP on this team, my goal is to ensure and promote excellent care of infants with a diagnosis of complex surgical anomalies in a level IV NICU setting.FigureMy latest educational endeavor has been enrolling in the Wound Ostomy Continence Nursing Education Program at Rutgers University's School of Nursing. I chose to complete this program because of my growing passion for neonatal patients with skin, wound, and ostomy challenges. Throughout my training, I have educated our advanced practice nursing group on advances in wound care and the appropriate product selection for wound and ostomy management. It is my hope that through education, prevention, and diligence, we can minimize injury and optimize healing for this vulnerable population. I have presented at 2 NANN annual educational conferences on topics regarding the surgical neonate, and I am in my second term on the NANN Research Committee. My interests include education, research, care of the complex surgical neonate, pain management, wound and ostomy care, and short bowel syndrome. I am excited to embark on this new role of facilitator for the surgical neonate special interest group (SIG) and educate NICU nurses across the nation about the many elements of surgical NICU nursing. I hope to foster discussions and create a repository for the latest evidence-based practice within our MyNANN discussion board. I want the SIG to be our members' go-to place for information and questions. What would you like to talk about?",

    "abstract": "HEAD-OF-BED ELEVATION AND TRACHEAL PEPSIN Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is one of the most important healthcare-associated infections in hospitalized patients. Bundles of interventions are applied in adult and pediatric intensive care units to try to prevent episodes of VAP, and the evidence base for these interventions has grown in recent years. In neonates, interventions to prevent VAP are largely modeled on those for older patients, although we have little evidence to show whether this makes sense. For example, a key element of VAP bundles is to elevate the head of the bed of the patient on a ventilator to a 30º to 45º angle. The rationale for this intervention is to reduce the patient's risk for aspirating bacterially contaminated gastrointestinal contents or oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal secretions into the airway. Practically speaking, we can elevate the head of a neonate's bed (head end of the incubator mattress) only about 15º in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). In ventilated neonates, in whom uncuffed endotracheal tubes are used, is 15º enough to prevent microaspiration of stomach contents? A study conducted at Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare–St. Joseph Hospital in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, measured the gastric enzyme pepsin, a biomarker for microaspiration, to determine whether the amount of tracheal pepsin changed with the angle of elevation of the head of bed. Serial tracheal samples (at 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days of ventilation) were obtained from intubated, ventilated very low-birth-weight infants (mean birth weight = 798 g). The presence of tracheal pepsin was determined by Western blot analysis using a specific antihuman pepsin antibody. They found that early elevation of the head of bed was associated with a lower rate of tracheal pepsin in the neonates. Tracheal pepsin was detected in 35 of the 66 ventilated neonates (53%). Neonates whose head elevation was in the upper quartile (≥14º) during the first sampling time (day 3) were less likely (P = .0013) to have tracheal pepsin compared with neonates whose head elevation was in the lowest quartile (≤8º). So, even though we cannot elevate the head of the bed as high as 30º to 45º, elevation to 15º can reduce microaspiration of stomach contents. Whether this reduces rates of neonatal VAP will require further study. 1. Metheny NA, Chang YH, Ye JS, et al. Pepsin as a marker for pulmonary aspiration. Am J Crit Care. 2002;11:150–154. 2.

J Neonatal Perinat Med. 2014;7:185–192. ANTIMICROBIAL-TREATED UMBILICAL CATHETERS Another preventable hospital-associated infection in the neonatal population is central line–associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), which can occur during the use of any type of central venous catheter, including umbilical venous catheters (UVCs). Recently, UVCs impregnated with silver zeolite (the patented silver compound AgION) have become available and are recommended by the Society for Healthcare Research and Epidemiology for use in preterm infants to prevent CLABSI.1 AgION is an inorganic compound that inhibits microbial growth by releasing active silver ions. AgION-coated UVCs were shown in a recent study2 to effectively reduce CLABSI rates in preterm infants. A study in 86 infants with gestational age less than 30 weeks were randomized to receive either an AgION-treated or nontreated polyurethane UVCs. In the AgION group, 2% of infants developed CLABSI compared with 22% of the infants in the control group (P = .005). AgION catheters were well tolerated without any evidence of silver toxicity. The recommendation by Society for Healthcare Research and Epidemiology was part of “A Compendium of Strategies to Prevent Healthcare-Associated Infections in Acute Care Hospitals: 2014 Updates.” In addition to CLABSI, these evidence-based recommendations cover major healthcare-associated infections including catheter-associated urinary tract infection, surgical site infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The prevention strategies pertain to all patients in acute care hospitals, including neonates, children, and adults. 1. Marschall J, Mermel LA, Fakih M, et al.

TRANSCUTANEOUS BILIRUBINOMETRY AFTER PHOTOTHERAPY Transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) meters are not typically used during phototherapy (unless an area of skin is covered with a patch), because the blanching of the exposed skin caused by phototherapy can underestimate the total serum bilirubin (TSB) level to an unknown degree. For the same reason, TcB readings are not generally used for postphototherapy follow-up of an infant's bilirubin level, even though it would be a more convenient way to assess for rebound hyperbilirubinemia than having to draw blood from the infant. A team of investigators set out to find out whether TcB values could reliably be used after phototherapy for neonatal jaundice.1 They compared simultaneous TcB readings and TSB values in 86 (47 preterm and 39 term) infants who were receiving in-hospital phototherapy. They collected a total of 189 parallel measurements, using the JM-103 transcutaneous bilirubinometer. They aimed to determine whether TcB readings could safely be used to decide whether phototherapy should be restarted or not, without drawing a TSB. They found that the mean TcB-TSB difference before phototherapy was −0.6 mg/dL. For the first 8 hours after phototherapy was discontinued, mean TcB levels were lower than TSB levels by an average of 2.4 mg/dL. After 8 hours, the mean difference between TcB and TSB gradually returned to pretreatment values (−1.8 mg/dL at 8-16 hours, −1.1 mg/dL at 16-24 hours, and −0.8 mg/dL after 24 hours). These TcB levels underestimated TSB slightly, in a predictable, time-dependent manner. To determine whether TcB levels could safely be used to decide on the need for restarting phototherapy, they used the TcB-TSB differences and the infant's individual phototherapy threshold (the level at which phototherapy would be restarted) at different time periods. Their analysis showed that if the TcB level measured at 8 hours postphototherapy was 7.3 mg/dL below the infant's threshold for treatment, it was safe to forego drawing a confirmatory TSB. After 8 hours, a TcB level that was 5.0 mg/dL or more lower than the treatment threshold suggested that no TSB was necessary. 1. Grabenhenrich J, Grabenhenrich L, Bührer C, Berns M. Transcutaneous bilirubin after phototherapy in term and preterm infants. Pediatrics. 2014;134:e1324–e1329. CHEMICAL EXPOSURE IN THE NICU For some years now, concern about the exposure of still-developing infants to chemicals has been framed in terms of risks for endocrine disruption, but this is a vague, long-term outcome that has not been sufficiently concerning to prompt widespread action. A new study from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Risk Sciences and Public Policy Institute1 suggests that the risks associated with exposure to harmful chemicals are far more immediate. Investigators assessed the types and magnitudes of nonendocrine toxic risks to neonates associated with medical device–related exposures to di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP). Using data about the magnitudes of exposure of neonates to DEHP from polyvinyl chloride devices and dose-response thresholds for DEHP toxicities, investigators calculated that the total daily exposure to DEHP for infants in the NICU can reach 16 mg/kg per day from such sources as intravenous tubing, endotracheal tubes, and blood transfusion tubing. How toxic is this level of DEHP? It is 4000 times higher than desired to prevent male reproductive tract toxicity, and 160 000 times higher than desired to prevent hepatic damage. Although this study does not prove that DEHP exposure harms infants, such exposure is known to be proinflammatory, and many of the comorbidities and complications of prematurity experienced by the neonatal population are inflammatory in nature. For example, the toxicity of endotracheal tubes could be a factor in the common finding that preterm infants who have been on mechanical ventilation have worse outcomes. The investigators conclude that DEHP exposures during neonatal intensive care are much higher than estimated safe limits. In consideration of the precautionary principle, the implications of this study are clear. Where alternatives are available, we should immediately replace all DEHP-containing products in the NICU with DEHP-free products. We should also seek to eliminate other sources of phthalates (vinyl flooring, paint, ventilators, incubators; soaps, lotions, and cosmetics used by staff and visitors; and soaps and lotions used for baby care) wherever possible, and encourage, through purchasing and advocacy, the development and use of products for neonatal care that are free of harmful chemicals. 1.

FEEDING BABIES ON NASAL CONTINUOUS POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE For the most part, infants receiving nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) therapy receive tube feedings, even if they are mature enough for oral feeding. Feeding the infant on NCPAP is not contraindicated,1 but it is often not attempted because of concerns for aspiration owing to gastric distention, or fears that an infant on NCPAP is not stable enough for oral feeding. Very little research has been done to assess whether infants on NCPAP can safely and effectively breastfeed or bottle feed. In a recent study, the safety and efficacy of oral feeding were examined in infants (37-42 weeks' postmenstrual age) with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) on NCPAP.2 Data from 26 infants with BPD on NCPAP who were orally fed were compared with those from 27 similar infants who were gavage fed. Infants in the NCPAP-oral fed group were on full oral feedings 17 days earlier than the NCPAP-gavage-fed group. No infant in either group experienced clinically significant aspiration pneumonia during oral feeding while on NCPAP. The investigators concluded that controlled introduction of oral feedings in infants with BPD who are on NCPAP is safe and can accelerate the acquisition of full oral feedings, an important milestone toward discharge from the NICU. 1.

FROM NICU TO THE MOON NICU nurses know that to do their jobs; it helps to be a little bit crafty, as in “arts and crafts.” Many of our patients stay with us for weeks or months, and their cribs and incubators are progressively decorated with name signs, pictures, and cards made by parents, siblings, and yes, even nurses, to celebrate birthdays, milestones, and holidays. Fortunately, every NICU has a few good photographers who can take really cute premie pictures for Mother's Day and Father's Day, embellished with perfect, unsmudged, 5-toe footprints. The nurses at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Scottish Rite recently blended their artistic skills in photography and drawing in a series of adorable photographs of the babies in their unit. They depicted their tiny patients dreaming about their futures as ballerinas, Olympic athletes, and astronauts by editing photos of sleeping babies with colorful drawings. The results can be seen in an online blog by NICU Clinical Educator Jessica Wright, “From NICU to the Moon” at http://www.dedicatedtoallbetter.org/nicu-moon/.",

    "abstract": "A NEW GLOBAL INITIATIVE: THE INTERNATIONAL NEONATAL CONSORTIUM The National Association of Neonatal Nurses (NANN) has engaged in a new collaboration in 2015 with a global organization to advocate for the patients we are committed to serve—neonates. National Association of Neonatal Nurses's partnership with the recently launched “International Neonatal Consortium (INC)” began in May 2015, after a representative from NANN participated in the INC's launch meeting held at the European Medicines Agency in London, United Kingdom. International Neonatal Consortium was convened under the leadership of Critical Path Institute, a nonprofit organization that was established in 2005 to support the US Food and Drug Administration's Critical Path Initiative program.1,2 Neonates are the patient population most frequently exposed to understudied therapies, as evidenced by one report noting that those born before 28 weeks' gestation are exposed to 12 unapproved drugs while in the neonatal intensive care unit.3 This means that they receive medications or therapies that have not been fully studied to establish safety or efficacy in the neonatal population. Another study demonstrated that 93% of hospitalized neonates were exposed to at least 1 off-label medication during their stay.4 Another study reports that extremely preterm neonates are exposed to more than 60 different medications during the hospitalization.5 National Association of Neonatal Nurses members are keenly aware of the therapeutic predicament that our patients and their families are placed in. The global neonatal community is aware that targeted development of new therapies for the neonatal population has been overlooked for decades. Very few innovations have been marketed that have a positive impact on the outcomes of neonatal specific conditions since the introduction of surfactant and antenatal steroids.6 Although some have previously argued that there are significant ethical challenges when conducting clinical studies in the neonatal population, today, it is considered to be unethical to expose neonates to understudied therapies.2 Development of new drug therapies demands a highly complex process requiring coordinated collaboration across all stakeholders. Prior to the generation of clinical efficacy and safety data, extensive preclinical testing and clinical pharmacology studies must be completed. The unique physiology of our fragile population further complicates this process, which has led to stagnation of the neonatal drug development process. International Neonatal Consortium was formed with a mission to specifically address these critical needs by combining resources from stakeholder groups worldwide, including such regulatory bodies as the Food and Drug Administration or European Medicines Agency, pharmaceutical industry partners, academic leaders in neonatal research, international neonatal research networks from multiple continents, funding organizations, special interest groups, parent organizations, and neonatal nursing organizations. The value of the voice of neonatal nurses was evident in INC's invitation for NANN to participate in this initiative. National Association of Neonatal Nurses and the Council of International Neonatal Nurses are the 2 nursing organizations actively involved with INC to represent the voice of neonatal nurses. Recently, Senate bill S. 2041, “Promoting Life-Saving New Therapies for Neonates Act of 2015” was introduced.7 This bill supports INC's commitment and purpose to advocate the development of new treatments specifically for the neonates. While previous policy initiatives have led to numerous drug products being labeled to include pediatric information, they did not sufficiently address the needs of the neonatal population.8,9 The Senate bill is designed to stimulate neonatal therapy development to drive additional improvements in newborn health outcomes. It is the intention of the bill's sponsor to provide a unique incentive to expand the ability of industry partners to develop new therapies specifically for the neonatal population. The new partnership with INC has allowed NANN to engage with this advocacy effort immediately. National Association of Neonatal Nurses was able to share the voice of neonatal nurses across congressional offices in Washington, District of Columbia, by drafting a letter of support describing our commitment to the newborns, who truly need the “lifesaving therapies.” National Association of Neonatal Nurses' representative to INC believes that the INC launch marked a significant point in history for the global neonatal community. International Neonatal Consortium is not simply a scientific community that will stimulate research but an entity with extensive involvement of a wide range of partners including the families and the nurses who stand by our vulnerable neonates. The ultimate mission of INC is to bring families, nurses, researchers, regulatory agencies, and other stakeholders closer together so that we can reduce perceived barriers to collaboration, share expertise and resources, and increase our understanding of each member's role in the complex process of developing new medicines. International Neonatal Consortium is the voice for neonates, who do not cast votes or speak for themselves. National Association of Neonatal Nurses is proud to actively engage in this global initiative. Contributed by Wakako M. Eklund, DNP, APN, NNP-BC. 1. Brumfield M.

DEADLY CRIB BUMPERS In spite of being listed as one of the most dangerous baby products,1 and guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics to avoid their use, crib bumper pads remain popular with parents. Except where banned, parents purchase crib bumpers purportedly to protect their infants from the trauma of bumping against the crib rails or having an arm or leg stuck in the gap. Parents no doubt believe that the store would not sell them if they were not safe. And let's face it, they are cute. Crib bumpers are known to be associated with accidental death in infants, but few systematic data on crib bumper deaths have been conducted. The question of causal mechanisms, and whether any other factors, such as clutter (comforters, blankets, pillows, toys) in the crib, increase risk for bumper-related deaths was recently examined in a study by Scheers and colleagues.1 Bumper-related deaths and injuries were identified from the US Consumer Product Safety Commission databases and according to the mechanism of death or injury. Deaths and injuries from bumper pads have increased over previous years. From 1985 to 2012, Consumer Product Safety Commission received reports of 48 bumper-related suffocations, 67% of which were associated with a bumper alone (no additional crib clutter) and 33% with a bumper and another object. When added to deaths reported to the National Center for the Review and Prevention of Child Deaths from 2008 to 2011, the total number of reported bumper-related deaths is 77. The mechanisms of bumper-related deaths vary but include the infant being smothered between the bumper and a part of the crib and choking on bumper ties. Older infants have used the bumper as a stepping stone to climb out of the crib and fall, striking their heads on the floor. It is clear that neither public health messages nor voluntary industry modifications of crib bumper pads to date have been sufficient to curb preventable deaths associated with bumpers. Parents and caregivers of newborn infants must be strongly cautioned against using crib bumper pads. Explaining that bumper pads do not, in fact, prevent injury to the infant, making their use entirely superfluous, might encourage parents to heed this warning. 1. Scheers NJ, Woodard DW, Thach BT.

PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT IN THE NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT, FROM A TO Z A special supplemental issue of the Journal of Perinatology is devoted to articles that aim to help neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) improve psychosocial support of everyone within their walls: parents, babies, and staff.1 Beginning with the standards of psychosocial support in the NICU, the 6 articles that follow cover the topics of involving family in developmental care,2 peer-to-peer support for parents,3 the role of mental health professionals in the NICU,4 palliative and bereavement care,5 discharge planning,6 and staff education to enhance psychosocial support for parents.7 The articles emphasize the concept that providing comprehensive psychosocial support requires interdisciplinary collaboration, and the importance of continuity of care, beginning in the antepartum period and extending to follow-up after discharge from the NICU. Each article was written by a multidisciplinary team and includes recommendations to help NICUs develop or improve psychosocial support, developmental care, and other family-centered programs in the NICU. This issue is a tremendous resource for NICU caregivers, and, at the time of this writing, is available online, with full-text access. 1. Hynan MT, Hall SL.

    "abstract": "EFFECT OF DONOR MILK ON SEVERE INFECTIONS AND MORTALITY IN VERY LOW BIRTH-WEIGHT INFANTS The Early Nutrition Study was a double-blind, parallel randomized clinical trial at 6 neonatal intensive care units in the Netherlands.1 The objective of the study was to determine whether providing donor milk instead of formula as a supplement when mother's milk was insufficient would reduce the incidences of necrotizing enterocolitis, serious infection, or all-cause mortality during the first 60 days of life. Enrolled infants weighed less than 1500 g. The participating centers admitted 930 very low birth-weight infants of which 377 were randomized of which 373 were entered. Infants receiving donor milk numbered 183 and 190 received formula. Mother's own milk was given 89% and 84.5% during the trial. The mean gestational age was 28.4 weeks and the mean birth weight was 1066 g. Some infants received exclusively mother's milk (7 in the donor group and 5 in the formula group), whereas 30 infants received either donor milks or formula exclusively (12 in the donor group and 18 in the formula group). The incident of combined outcome was not different, 44.7% formula and 42.1% donor milk. Neither negative nor beneficial effects for use of donor milk were found. This study does not provide information on why donor milk lacks short-term beneficial effects. Future trials should investigate longer duration of use of human donor milk on short- and long-term outcomes. SWADDLING AND THE RISK OF SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME: A META-ANALYSIS Swaddling varies from culture to culture but has gained popularity in many countries including the United Kingdom and United States. Swaddling is usually defined as wrapping an infant in a light cloth leaving the head exposed. The benefits of swaddling are to promote more quite sleep time in infants less than 7 weeks of age. The purpose of this meta-analysis1 was to see whether there was any correlation for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and swaddling for sleep. A literature search from 1950 to 2014 was done and 4 studies were included in the review. Inclusion criteria included studies that were case control or cohort by design, used SIDS as an outcome as well as swaddling or infant wrapping. In the 4 studies reviewed, the proportion of infants swaddled was higher in the SIDS cases than in the control cases. There were 760 SIDS cases compared with 1759 control subjects. The mean age of the swaddled infant was 57 days compared with 96 for nonswaddled. There was no significant difference of the age of the swaddled infants with SIDS. Swaddling peaked around 2 months in all studies and dropped off between 4 and 6 months. The risk of SIDS from swaddling increased with age and with infants greater than or equal to 6 months of life. Positioning had noticeable effect on outcome. Infants swaddled and placed prone have the greatest risk of SIDS. In infants swaddled and placed prone or side position, the risk of SIDS doubles compared with nonswaddled infants. There was a small but significant risk of SIDS associated in the studies with being swaddled and placed on their backs. Swaddling is more common with younger infants. Swaddling seems to be linked to SIDS in the older infant, which may be due to the ability of the infant to roll prone. Swaddling is encouraged in many countries to reduce excessive crying. Some countries like the Netherlands which have very low SIDS rates have issued guidelines not to initiate swaddling after 4 months and to stop swaddling as soon as the infant makes any attempt to turn over and all swaddling should be stopped by 6 months of life. Limitations to this meta-analysis is that the heterogeneity between studies was substantial and none of the studies adequately described the swaddling or wrapping technique used. Future studies are needed to address the issue of SIDS and swaddling and the appropriate age to stop swaddling. BREAST MILK CONSUMPTION IN PRETERM NEONATES AND CARDIAC SHAPE IN ADULTHOOD Long-term alterations in cardiac morphology and function are associated with preterm births. This was a randomized control trial1 between 1982 and 1985 across 5 different United Kingdom centers involving 926 preterm infants weighing less than 1850 g and with no major congenital anomalies. The infants were randomized to either breast milk donated by an unrelated lactating woman or nutrient-enriched formula. A total of 102 infants from the original cohort were followed up of which 30 were fed human milk exclusively and 16 were formula. The comparison group consisted of 102 individuals born to uncomplicated full-term pregnancies. All participants were studied between the ages of 23 and 28 years. All received a cardiovascular magnetic resonance. Initial study results showed that both groups, human milk and formula, had altered blood biochemistry profiles and elevated blood pressures when compared with the full-term control group. Premature infants in the human milk had an increase mean left ventricular end-diastolic volume index and left ventricular stroke volume index compared with the formula-fed group. Reduced thoracic cavity dimensions were noted in the formula-fed group as compared with the human milk group. There was no difference between the 2 groups with regard to the aortic diameter although the pulmonary artery diameter was larger in the formula-fed infants. The evidence from this study shows an association that early nutrition in premature infants has an effect on cardiac structure and function in later life. Infants fed human milk had values that approached those infants who were full term. Breast milk is noted to have greater bioactivity and bioavailability of growth factors, enzymes, and antibodies as compared with formula. The American Academy of Pediatric continues to recommend that preterm infants receive donor milk instead of preterm formula whenever possible. Breastfeeding is not able to reverse all cardiac changes related to the degree of prematurity, but the difference between those fed human milk versus formula is significant. NEONATAL NURSES: KEY STAKEHOLDERS IN THE INTERNATIONAL NEONATAL CONSORTIUM The International Neonatal Consortium (INC) was launched to accelerate the development of safe and effective therapies for neonates.1 Neonates remain therapeutic orphans when it comes to drug development. The introduction of antenatal corticosteroids and surfactant were the last new medications introduced than have substantially improved outcomes for neonates. These drugs were introduced 20 to 25 years ago. In 2014, the first Annual Neonatal Workshop was cosponsored by Burroughs, Wellcome Fund, the Critical Path Institute and the FDA to help establish high-quality data to guide practice and regulatory discussion. The INC was launched in 2015 at the European Medicines Agency. Nursing engagement and leadership in INC includes nursing education, family education, and nursing research. There needs to be a culture of embracing research in the NICUs to conduct trials that will evaluate safety and effectiveness of medicines and therapeutic interventions. Educating the nurses on the research process as well as educating the families on the value of research for improving outcomes is a main goal of INC. A culture that fosters research to enhance clinical trials is what is needed in NICUs. The NICU nurse can contribute to better patient outcomes by participating in bedside research and ultimately will be able to protect their patient from harm.",

    "abstract": "ASSOCIATION OF PREOPERATIVE ANEMIA WITH POSTOPERATIVE MORTALITY IN NEONATES Neonatal postoperative mortality is substantially higher than general pediatric patients. One study in 2005 reported a 30-day mortality rate for pediatrics as 41.6 per 10,000 operations versus 386.5 neonatal deaths per 10,000 operations.1 A new study has attempted to define the neonatal mortality in US hospitals and determine whether there are specific risk factors for neonates undergoing noncardiac surgery. Anemia is a known risk factor in the adult population but has not been studied in the neonatal population. Data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program from the years 2012-2013 were utilized. All children with a document hematocrit value preoperatively were included. Exclusion criteria were patients who had a preoperative transfusion and neonates with congenital heart disease. A neonate was defined as an infant from 0 to 30 days of life. Anemia was defined as a hematocrit of less than 40%. Neonates comprised 7% of the database (N = 2764), with 69.9% term or greater than 36 weeks' gestation. Eighty-five percent of the neonates weighed greater than 2 kg. In total, 3.4% of the neonates (n = 93) had postoperative in-hospital mortality as compared with 0.6% of all children 0 to 18 years of age. Preoperative hematocrits ranged from 24% to 52%, with a median of 38% in neonates. Neonates with preoperative anemia of less than 40% accounted for 32% (n = 892) of the neonates. The neonatal survivors accounted for 31% of neonates (n = 825) who had a hematocrit of greater than 40%. Sixty-seven (72%) of 93 neonates who died had a hematocrit of less than 40%. When controlling for other risk factors, a postoperative in-hospital mortality rate of neonates with hematocrits of less than 40% was 7.5% compared with neonates with hematocrits of greater than 40%, which was 1.4%. This is the first study to show an association between preoperative anemia and postoperative mortality in neonates.2 LANGUAGE OUTCOMES AT 36 MONTHS IN PREMATURELY BORN CHILDREN ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE QUALITY OF DEVELOPMENTAL CARE IN NICUS Preterm infants often have neurodevelopmental delays in language skills, especially in the areas of vocabulary and grammar. These delays have been reported in preschool-aged children. Impaired language skills have been reported in preterm infants without severe clinical complications. Less than optimal neonatal auditory and communicative experiences may be associated with language difficulties. Quality of care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) may have a direct impact on the development of language skills. A recent study1 evaluated the quality of care with respect to developmental care practices in 19 Italian NICUs with the preterm infants at 36 months of life. The Neonatal Adequate Care for Quality of Life (Neo-Acqua) Quality of Care questionnaire was utilized. Preterm infants were compared with a control cohort of term infants. Each group was assessed at 7 points in time from discharge until 84 months of life. Follow-up for language assessment was taken from the 36-month follow-up. Inclusion criteria for the preterm group were gestation age of 22 to 29.6 weeks and/or a birth weight between 401 and 1500 g. Exclusion criteria included major brain lesions (grade III or IV), periventricular leucomalacia greater than stage 1, retinopathy of prematurity greater than stage 2, documented hearing deficits, genetic syndromes, and/or major malformations. All infants in the full-term cohort were 37 weeks or greater and weighed at least 2500 g. All these infants were healthy and had no risk factors during pregnancy. The sample size included 111 preterm infants and 108 term infants. Two indexes of developmental care were used to evaluate the NICU infants: the Infant Center Care (ICC) index and the Infant Pain Management (IPM) index. The ICC index included 4 items: (1) parent involvement; (2) kangaroo care as routine; (3) duration per day of kangaroo care (< or >45 minutes); and (4) nursing interventions such as containment, postural maneuvers, and reduction of disturbing tactile stimulation. The IPM includes 5 categories: (1) number of invasive procedures and nonpharmacological interventions were used; (2) number of invasive procedures where pharmacological interventions were used; (3) use of pharmacological analgesia or sedation for mechanical ventilation; (4) use of blood collection procedures, heal stick, or mechanical; and (5) use of pain score. The scores for both the IPM and ICC were calculated, and the NICUs were split into 2 levels, one being high-quality developmental care and low-quality developmental care. There was no difference in the characteristic of the NICUs or for the infant's perinatal data. There was no significant difference in age, education, family, and BDI scores among the mothers in the low- or high-quality NICUS and the control group. There was significant difference between the 3 groups low, high, and control on word comprehension and sentence completion scores. Both low- and high-quality units scored lower than the control group. There was no difference among the groups for repetition and naming ability. Low developmental care units had significantly lower scores on sentence completion than the high-quality units. Low developmental quality units had lower scores than full-term infants on word completion. No significant difference in high-quality developmental care units and the control group in word and sentence completion. Infants in low-quality developmental care units showed worse receptive language skills. This study has demonstrated that developmental care procedures in the NICU are positively associated with language outcomes beyond infancy. THE USE OF SHORT MESSAGE SERVICES (SMS) TO PROVIDE MEDICAL UPDATING TO PARENTS IN THE NICU Long-term hospitalization of the premature infant is a very stressful time for parents. New technology is being used in the hospital in different areas. Recently, 1 neonatal intensive care unit decided to use short messaging services (SMS) to keep families up to date on their children's health status.1 Two questionnaires were given to both families and nursing at the initiation of the SMS study and at the conclusion. This study was conducted in a tertiary care unit of 49 beds, with 14 beds being intensive care unit and 35 step-down beds. SMS messages were sent every morning at 9:00 am with a 1-sentence preface and a 1-sentence conclusion. Procedures for the day were included. No acute events or deterioration were sent via SMS. This information was delivered personally. The pre-questionnaire results indicated that the families had a high degree of satisfaction of medical treatment, information provided, and communication with staff. The post-questionnaire results for families showed statistical improvement in physician availability and patience, as well as parenteral feeling of comfort in approaching physicians and nurses, and regularly receiving information regarding their children's medical status. The nurse pre-questionnaire results indicated that 75.9% felt this SMS communication would add to their workload, 40.7% felt it would not be a user-friendly method of communication, and 33% felt it would not be a convenient method of communication. Post-questionnaire results indicated that only 51.4% of nurses felt it added to their workload, 17.6% felt it was not user-friendly, and only 1 nurse (3.1%) felt it was not a convenient method of communication. Use of SMS highlights an easy and user-friendly modality for providing information to families. It is a complementary tool for encouraging and improving personal communication between staff and families.",

    "abstract": "CHOOSING ANTIBIOTICS WISELY IN NEONATES The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Vermont Oxford Network (VON) have decided to partner together to improve patient safety and raise the quality or neonatal care.1 Core elements for antimicrobial stewardship have been developed by the CDC, and the VON will incorporate these elements into their new quality improvement collaborative iNICQ 2016: Choosing Antibiotics Wisely.* The focus of the collaborative will include improved communications, increased monitoring of infections, antibiotic use, as well as best practice for the prevention of infections. Appropriate prescription, dose, and duration will be established. Teams will work with VON leadership and expert faculty using the Choosing Antibiotics Wisely toolkit. There will be a quality Improvement Summit that will allow teams to share what they have learned and accomplished with the neonatal community.1 NEONATAL AIRWAY SIMULATORS: WHAT TO BUY? Physical and functional fidelity is an important characteristic of neonatal simulators to improve airway management skills. Until recently, no studies have evaluated the fidelity of these simulators. A research project evaluated 8 different simulators, and significant differences were found between the simulators. The simulators evaluated were as follows: (1) SimNewB; (2) Newborn Ann; (3) Premature Anne; (4) Neonatal Intubation Trainer; (5) Newborn HAL; (6) Premie Blue; (7) air Sim Baby; and (8) Newborn Airway Trainer. Twenty-seven neonatal healthcare providers were part of the panel that evaluated the simulators; 12 of these providers were neonatal nurse practitioners (44%). There were 2 testing sessions, with 8 separate airways skill stations. Each station was complete with a simulator and appropriate equipment needed such as Miller blades #0 and #1, endotracheal tube, stylets, face masks, laryngoscope handle, and laryngeal mask airway (LMA). Each group rotated to all 8 stations in a predetermined order. The skills performed at each station included bag mask ventilation, LMA placement, and endotracheal intubation. Each skill was performed on the simulator.1 The SimNewB and the Newborn Anne scored the highest overall physical fidelity scores for full-term newborns, whereas the Premature Anne scored the highest for the preterm neonatal manikin. Significant differences were found in the face, mouth, gum tongue epiglottis, vocal cords, and airway tissue. The Newborn Airway Trainer was the highest overall physical fidelity task trainer. The highest functional fidelity simulator for mask ventilation and intubation was Premature Anne; for LMA training was Newborn Anne and SimNewB; and for airway management training was SimNewB. Premature Anne had the highest overall functional fidelity score.1 Results of this study may help the industry develop new airway devices for simulation. These results may also provide educators some guidance in choosing the simulator that would work best for their institution. NEONATAL RESUSCITATION AND HELPING BABIES BREATHE GLOBAL IMPORTANCE A global initiative between Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) and Helping Babies Breathe (HBB) from the World Health Organization (WHO) provides complementary ways to decrease infant mortality in low- and middle-income countries. NRP was developed in the 1970s and launched in 1987 as a response to the rate of neonatal mortality and the need to recognize and provide initial management of infants to first-level hospitals. NRP standardized the approach to all infants at the time of delivery based on best evidence currently available. The late 1980s was the first time NRP was taught outside North America. Other countries' healthcare systems facing similar challenges petitioned the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in the early 1990s to begin train-the-trainer courses. These courses were all instituted in developing countries where health systems were refining mother and newborn care. Studies indicated improvement in provider knowledge, skill set, and performance. Recognition of a newborn needing resuscitation was improved. NRP initiatives achieved reduction in perinatal and neonatal mortality in many regions of the world.1 Twenty years after its inauguration, global neonatal mortality still needed to be addressed. The first 28 days of life accounts for 40% of deaths for children younger than 5 years. Ninety-eight percent of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, with 75% occurring in the first week of life and 50% occurring on the first day. In countries with the highest mortality, 60% of births occur outside the hospital.2 New approaches were need and the AAP in 2006 developed the Global Implemental Task Force to address infant mortality outside the hospital. HBB was released by the WHO in 2010 with the goal of increased commitment and resources for resuscitation as essential newborn care. It was decided that basic resuscitation steps would be advantageous for most infants. Developing a transportable package that emphasizes learning and owned by the individual was their vision. There needed to be a change in thinking that infant death was inevitable. A graphic action plan with a pictorial algorithm instead of a written algorithm was developed with the goal of empowering the learner to acquirer knowledge and skill set. The Golden Minute was developed, which stressed that every infant should be either breathing or receiving ventilation by 1 minute after birth. Train-the-trainer workshops started globally and have reached 73 countries. Both NRP and HBB offer simplicity and clarity in neonatal resuscitation but at different levels. First-level facilities educate and train on basic skills that can be utilized in or out of healthcare facilities. HBB flows directly into NRP if needed. Higher-level facilities such as district hospitals receive NRP training to care for sick and premature infants.1 The effectiveness of this program highlights the importance of training with follow-up practice. Mastery of advance skills did require further classes. A reduction in infant mortality on day of life 1 has been demonstrated with changes in the clinical management of infants with HBB training. Skilled providers at every delivery in or out of the hospital setting have the ultimate goal of decreasing infant mortality. Working together, NRP and HBB can strive to meet the Every Nation Action Plan goal of decreasing infant mortality to fewer than 10 per 1000 live births by 2035.",

    "abstract": "BENEFITS OF NANN'S ANNUAL EDUCATIONAL CONFERENCE: REFLECTIONS FROM 2013 CONFERENCE SCHOLARSHIP RECIPIENTS Opportunity, networking, continuing education: these are just some of the benefits of attendance described by NANN's 29th Annual Educational Conference scholarship recipients. NANN awarded 29 registration scholarships to attend the conference in part because of a grant from Mead Johnson. These scholarships were awarded to members who had an interest in advancing their career and involvement in neonatal care, management, and research.Attendees of the 29th Annual Educational Conference attend an interprofessional concurrent session featuring the diverse viewpoints of a parent organization director, physician, nurse, and parents.When asked why attendance at the NANN Annual Educational Conference is important, several themes emerged. Networking and keeping current on neonatal topics came out on top. Mary Ann Blatz, MSN, RNC-NIC, IBCLC, clinical nurse specialist at Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital and the 2013 Small Grant Award Recipient, offered this reflection: “I attended the NANN Annual Educational Conference to update my knowledge base of neonatal nursing care, network with colleagues, and accept the Small Grant Award for my proposed research: A Feasibility Study of a Smart Phone App That Allows Mothers of Preterm Infants to Monitor Their Breastmilk Supply for Their Infants Hospitalized in the NICU.” Connecting with colleagues from across the country was especially beneficial for strengthening relationships, as Lizz Welch-Carre, MS, RN, NNP-BC, Children's Hospital Colorado, scholarship recipient and NANN Health Policy and Advocacy Committee member, describes: “The conference benefitted me because I was able to network with others, in particular those individuals who are part of the Health Policy and Advocacy Committee. Up until that point, my only contact had been via e-mail or phone.” When asked what they would bring back to their units, the conference scholarship recipients talked about updated neonatal care practices and innovative ideas that they learned at the conference presentations. Grace Sullivan, MSN, RN, York, PA, scholarship recipient and current Small Grants Committee Member, described one of her favorite conference presentations. “The most interesting presentation for me during this conference was a speaker who presented on HIV/AIDS and gaining knowledge about how to treat moms and babies based on their health practices and HIV/AIDS status. She was knowledgeable and presented in a way that involved the audience and helped us to practice the new knowledge that she shared through interactive scenarios. I am hoping to create a small bulletin board for my unit to share the knowledge gained from the above-mentioned presenter. The knowledge would be helpful for our labor and delivery and maternity units as well.” The conference scholarships offered many benefits to these members to network, learn of innovative neonatal care practices, and earn important neonatal-focused continuing education hours. Sharyl Sadowski, MS, NNP-BC, Orland Park, Illinois, Medication Safety in the NICU Position Statement Task Force member and conference scholarship recipient, plans to attend the 30th NANN Annual Educational Conference in Phoenix, Arizona. She states, “It is the one event where I feel I get timely information about neonatal care, can network with others in the neonatal field, and have fun while learning!” ANNUAL EDUCATIONAL CONFERENCE Why You Should AttendFigureAttend the conference to recognize the role of the neonatal nurse as a leader and change agent for the profession, position yourself as an advocate for patients and their families, apply evidence-based practice recommendations in clinical care, gain performance practices that support patient safety, establish a mechanism for reaching and collaborating with professional peers, and identify products for use in your clinical care environment. Additional information regarding this year's conference can be found at http://www.nannconference.org.

    "abstract": "MEET YOUR NANN VOLUNTEER: ERIN KEELSErin Keels, APRN, NNP-BCPassionate, grateful, and busy—these 3 words describe the National Association of Neonatal Nurses (NANN) volunteer Erin Keels, APRN, NNP-BC, a member of NANN since 1994, the National Association of Neonatal Nurse Practitioners (NANNP) since 2008, and the current NANN liaison to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Committee on the Fetus and Newborn (COFN). Erin began her nursing career as a nursing assistant at Columbus Children's Hospital, now Nationwide Children's Hospital, graduating in 1988 from Ohio State University. Mentorship and dedicated preceptors encouraged Erin to become a neonatal nurse practitioner (NNP), and in 1993 she graduated from the certificate program at Columbus Children's Hospital and obtained a master's degree from Ohio State University in 2003. Erin is now the director of the NNP Program at Nationwide, a program that includes 95 NNPs, 5 pediatric nurse practitioners, and 1 physician assistant. Erin says that it is her honor to work with intelligent, dedicated, compassionate, and authentic professionals. Erin is passionate about interprofessional team practice in the newborn intensive care unit. She is constantly impressed with the impact neonatal nurses and NNPs have on the short- and long-term outcomes of neonates in their care. The trust parents and families place in the neonatal care teams constantly humbles Erin. Families trust neonatal nurses and nurse practitioners not only to care for their baby but also to teach them to be confident and competent to care for their baby at discharge. In addition to technology challenges and the rapid changes to evidence-based practice that “keep her on her toes,” Erin finds enjoyment in the camaraderie of working closely with other disciplines, noting that it helps her to learn and grow in ways she could not have predicted. Feeling supported by mentors who encouraged her to dream and take chances, Erin feels NANN and NANNP helped her to see beyond her clinical practice group and management structure in Columbus, OH, and to learn what others are achieving or struggling with to improve outcomes for babies and their families on a larger scale. Erin started as a volunteer working on a NANNP committee led by Carol Jaeger, MS, RN, NNP-BC, that drafted the NNP workforce position statement. She enjoyed writing this document and working with the team involved in the project. While working on advanced practice advocacy initiatives and lecturing at state and national levels about neonatal abstinence syndrome and NNP leadership, she was approached by NANN about the liaison position to the AAP, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The COFN studies issues and current advances in fetal and neonatal care. The committee also makes recommendations regarding neonatal practice and collaborates with the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) to consider perinatal issues and work on new editions of ACOG's Guidelines for Perinatal Care. Liaisons to the COFN represent the Centers for Disease Control, the National Institutes of Health, the Canadian Pediatric Society, ACOG, and NANN. Erin states: “A COFN liaison works with the committee to review, revise, and draft clinical practice policy statements; collaborate on shared topics of interest; and provide updates and reports on their respective organizations. When I joined the committee, the first thing I learned was that I needed to learn a lot more about writing at that level.” The committee members are truly collaborative and supportive, and Erin expresses her gratitude for wonderful mentors, including Dr Kristi Watterberg, COFN chair. Erin feels comfortable raising questions or concerns or ideas that impact patients, families, and NANN/NANNP membership. Her goals for her COFN liaison work include working to have provider neutral language in the policy statements when appropriate, serving as the voice of the neonatal nurse/NNP as policy statements are drafted or revised, and ensuring that NANN and AAP guidelines and policy statements are congruent and complementary with one another. Erin shares: “So far, during my tenure, I was able to successfully advocate for the AAP's endorsement of the NANNP Advanced Practice Registered Nurse: Role, Preparation and Scope of Practice position statement. That was a great example of cooperation and support from the AAP of NANN/NANNP. At the same time, I have been working as one of the primary authors on the revision of the Prevention and Management of Pain policy statement. As part of the review process, multiple AAP committees provided feedback on the document, which was very reaffirming and positive.” Erin also serves as the NANN liaison to the AAP Section on Perinatal Pediatrics; in this role, she attends their annual meeting and provides pertinent updates about NANN/NANNP, collaborates on projects, and provides input on topics of shared interest. “The AAP is truly interested in partnering and collaborating with NANN/NANNP to improve outcomes for babies and their families,” she says. Erin remembers how daunting it was to become involved at the national level. She believes that every nurse or NNP has something unique to offer that adds value to NANN and NANNP. Her advice is to consider working on a short-term committee or task force such as policy statement review or clinical guideline development. This helps build confidence and establish networks around the country with other members who they can collaborate with and continue to increase their involvement. Passionate, grateful, and busy, Erin is currently working on her doctorate of nursing practice (DNP) degree, in addition to her liaison duties. Volunteering for NANN has provided Erin with many opportunities to have valuable mentoring relationships and professional opportunities. The National Association of Neonatal Nurses is grateful for a passionate and dedicated professional such as Erin Keels. BIG IDEAS.

NANN congratulates all of its chapters and members! 31ST ANNUAL EDUCATIONAL CONFERENCE In October, NANN and NANNP welcomed 706 attendees to their 31st annual educational conference. Dallas, Texas, hosted big ideas, big opportunities, and big fun! Entertaining events included a photo booth, speed networking, chapter networking, and a party shuttle to local hot spots. There was an enormous amount of learning, too! Session topics included genomics, intrauterine drug exposure, the surgical neonate, global health, and the infant microbiome. There were paper sessions and phenomenal general sessions that inspired attendees to change how they lead and how they practice. In the first general session, Dr Britt Berrett encouraged attendees to create positive change through the creation of exceptional teams. His presentation reviewed 10 specific themes to create positive change, which also are outlined in his coauthored book Patients Come Second: Leading Change by Changing the Way You Lead. The second-general session focused on psychosocial challenges faced by parents during and after NICU admission. This session was presented by Kelli Kelley, BJ, a former neonatal intensive care unit mother who founded and directs the nonprofit parent support group Hand to Hold. The group's mission is to navigate resources and provide support to parents of premature and medically fragile infants. Visit http://handtohold.org for additional information. The 31st annual educational conference ended with the vibrant Virginia Beeson, MSN, BSN, NEA-BC, USN (Ret). Beeson motivated the audience to create a plan to implement a change within their institution on the basis of one thing they learned at the conference. By focusing on one change at a time, neonatal healthcare providers can overcome institutional barriers and cultural changes. The NANN board of directors thanks the conference planning committee, speakers, and vendors for another successful conference.

    "abstract": "END-OF-LIFE CARE IN THE NICU End-of-life care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is of enormous importance to both staff and families. Cortezzo and colleagues1 used a survey designed to assess the quality of end-of-life care delivered in the NICU from the perspective of neonatologists, nurse practitioners, nurses, and parents. The survey also asked participants whether they thought that the NICU (which did not have a formal palliative care team) would benefit from such a team. The parents who were invited to participate were those who had lost a child longer than 4 months prior to the start of the study. All healthcare providers (HCPs) were asked their opinions about whether they had received education in end-of-life care, their level of comfort in providing care, and discussing death with families. Furthermore, HCPs were asked to rate their own end-of-life care practices (eg, did they provide consistent end-of-life care?) and those of their team members. Nurses were asked to rate the end-of-life practices of the unit's neonatologists (eg, did they communicate sensitively with families, control pain adequately, minimized unnecessary procedures, and debrief staff afterwards?). Parents were asked whether they understood that their baby was dying, what their options were, and whether they knew what to expect. For example, did they take part in decisions, and were their wishes honored? Did they have enough time with their baby before death; were they able to hold their baby and create memories? Was their baby comfortable, or did they think more could have been done? Did the parents feel abandoned by the staff? Did parents want follow-up after they left the hospital, and did they receive it? The HCPs expressed a high level of confidence in the end-of-life care offered in the NICU. In general, they had received sufficient education about end-of-life care, their level of comfort with end-of-life issues was high, and they considered themselves able to effectively meet the end-of-life care needs of infants and families, even without the advantages of a formal palliative care team. Although the HCPs rated themselves highly on ensuring the dying baby's level of comfort, only 57% of parents judged their babies to be comfortable around the time of death. In this study, most parents agreed with HCPs that parents were involved in decision making and their wishes were respected. Survey items with lower scores were those that involved speaking with families about grief, sending messages of condolence, or participating in post-death closure conferences. Emotional support and debriefing conferences for the healthcare team were also reported less frequently by HCPs. About 71% of parents believed that the emotional support they received from staff during their baby's care was adequate. Only 57% of parents felt that they were not abandoned by the NICU staff and 43% wanted more contact with staff following their baby's death in the NICU. In spite of the relatively high ratings of the end-of-life care provided in the NICU, all participants in this study (HCPs and parents) generally agreed that the NICU would benefit from having a formal palliative care team. The researchers point out that the difference in perception between staff and parents about the dying babies' level of comfort suggests differences in how HCPs and parents might be assessing comfort, and this is worthy of additional study. A parent's greatest concern at end-of-life is often that their child might suffer2 so it is of the utmost importance that physicians, nurses, and parents all have the same understanding of what constitutes “suffering,” and “comfort,” at the end-of life, and how best to avoid the one and achieve the other. 1.

THE GASTRIC RESIDUAL QUESTION If you still routinely check gastric residuals in preterm infants before administering bolus gastric tube feedings, you are not alone. The practice is still widespread, despite being based primarily on the commonsense theory, rather than the evidence-based theory of practice. When Gregory and Connolly1 surveyed neonatal nurses in 2009, an overwhelming majority (92.9%) of respondents reported using gastric residual volumes to delay or alter feedings and 70% said that gastric residuals volumes determined how feeding volumes were advanced. Torrazza and colleagues2 point out that measuring gastric residuals can have negative consequences, such as damaging the gastric mucosa by applying negative pressure when aspirating on the naso or orogastric tube, and discarding gastric enzymes and acids along with the residuals, which is another common practice. They conducted a study to evaluate whether infants who did not undergo routine evaluation of gastric residuals prior to every bolus gastric tube feeding would demonstrate an increased enteral intake at 2 weeks of age and reach full feedings (120 mL/kg per day) more quickly compared with infants undergoing routine evaluation of gastric residuals prior to every feeding. Secondary outcomes including enteral intake, growth, and adverse events were compared. This randomized controlled trial enrolled 61 infants (30 in 1 group and 31 in the other) with a mean gestational age of 27 ± 2.3 weeks and a mean birth weight of 924 ± 238 g for both groups combined. They found no differences between the groups on any of the enteral feeding or growth parameters when assessed at 2 and 3 weeks. A trend for a difference was found between the groups in time to reach feedings of 150 mL/kg per day, which occurred 6 days earlier in the no gastric residual group (22.3 vs 28.1 days), although this did not reach statistical significance. Length of time that central access was required was also nearly a week shorter in the no gastric residual group (21.3 vs 15.6 days), but this did not reach statistical significance either. There were no differences in the rate of parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease, sepsis, or necrotizing enterocolitis between the groups. Although this was not a large study, it was the first prospective randomized controlled trial to evaluate this common untested practice in neonatal care.

NEWT: NEWBORN WEIGHT TOOL FOR BREASTFED NEWBORNS All babies lose weight in the first week of life, especially breastfed newborns. In the healthy newborn breastfed population, the degree of weight loss influences many clinical decisions, such as the need for lactation support or supplementation, the timing of discharge, and the timing of postdischarge follow-up. An excessive amount of weight loss is considered a marker of insufficient intake, dehydration, or possible lactation failure. Excessive weight loss has often been defined as approximately 5% to 10% of birth weight. Without linking weight loss with age from birth, however, these weight criteria have not been very useful in clinical practice because 5% on day 1 of life is clearly more serious than 5% on day 3. An hour-specific weight loss nomogram, much like the hour-specific bilirubin nomogram, for breastfed newborns would be clinically useful, but such data have not been available until now. Flaherman and colleagues1 developed the first hour-specific weight loss nomogram for breastfed newborns to assist in the early identification of infants who are on a trajectory for adverse outcomes. They collected data from 161, 471 term, singleton neonates born at 36 weeks' gestation or more at Northern California Kaiser Permanente hospitals in 2009 to 2013. Differential weight loss by delivery mode was evident by 6 hours after delivery and persisted over time. Almost 5% of vaginally delivered newborns and more than 10% of those delivered by cesarean had lost 10% or more of their birth weight 48 hours after delivery. By 72 hours, more than 25% of newborns delivered by cesarean had lost 10% or more of their birth weight. Because of the differences in weight loss according to delivery method, 2 curves were created—1 for vaginal births and 1 for cesarean births. These graphical depictions of hourly weight loss in a large, diverse population of exclusively breastfed infants will allow clinicians to assess and monitor a newborn's pattern of weight loss during the birth hospitalization, but not beyond. The vaginal delivery curve ends at 72 hours, and the cesarean curve ends at 96 hours. Clinicians can plot the baby's birth weight, any subsequent weight measurements, and the discharge weight, and see clearly whether the newborn is following the typical curve or whether the infant's weight loss curve is steeper, suggesting a possible need for intervention. The weight nomogram, called “NEWT” (Newborn Weight Tool), is available online at www.newbornweight.org. 1. Flaherman VJ, Schaefer EW, Kuzniewicz MW, Li SX, Walsh EM, Paul IM.

ALARMS STILL NUMBER ONE TECHNOLOGY HAZARD Every year, the ECRI Institute, an independent nonprofit organization, researches the top medical technology hazards most likely to cause accidents and patient harm. The report also provides recommended action steps to help healthcare facilities to maintain safe healthcare environments for patients and staff. In 2015, the “top 10” list includes: Alarm hazards: inadequate alarm configuration policies and practices Data integrity: incorrect or missing data in electronic health records and other health information technology systems Mix-up of intravenous lines leading to misadministration of drugs and solutions Inadequate reprocessing of endoscopes and surgical instruments Ventilator disconnections not caught because of improperly set or missed alarms Patient-handling device use errors and device failures “Dose creep”: unnoticed variations in diagnostic radiation exposures Robotic surgery: complications due to insufficient training Cybersecurity: insufficient protections for medical devices and systems Overwhelmed recall and safety alert management programs (so that recalled medical devices might be missed and are not taken out of service) For the fourth year in a row, clinical alarm hazards, now a Joint Commission National Patient Safety Goal, remain number 1 on ECRI's list. This year, the report draws particular attention to alarm configuration practices. This refers to determining which alarms should be enabled, selecting the alarm limits to use, and establishing the default alarm priority level. These selections are based on the needs of the unit and the type of patients being cared for. If alarms are not configured appropriately, clinicians can either miss important patient conditions or be exposed to excessive number of insignificant alarms, worsening the problem of alarm fatigue. The complete report is available at https://www.ecri.org/Pages/2015-Hazards.aspx. Alarm safety is also the focus of the Vermont-Oxford Network's iNICQ 2015: Alarm Safety! Driving Outcomes With Evidence-based Oxygen Therapy and Safe Monitoring Practices. Presentations from the 2014 Annual Quality Congress on oxygen saturation targets and managing oxygen saturation alarms in the neonatal intensive care unit are available for viewing online at http://9slides.com/embed/2013-AMQC-Ketko-and-Soll-Saturation-Alarms-and-ROP. The first presentation, by Anastasia Ketko from the University of Michigan, is about the challenges faced by a single room neonatal intensive care unit when the staff initially tried to narrow their oxygen saturation targets to prevent retinopathy of prematurity and their subsequent efforts to manage the 2 million annual alarms they experienced in the unit. Ketko described a tool they developed for charge nurses called an “alarm barometer” that provides data on the average daily number of alarms associated with each infant. This tool is used to make staffing assignments to avoid pairing a nurse with 2 patients who are “frequent alarmers,” and it has helped to reduce frustration and alarm fatigue.

    "abstract": "INTERVENTION AND PERIVIABLE BIRTH Many issues concerning the care of “periviable” infants remain unresolved. When faced with a woman in labor earlier than 24 weeks' gestation, questions can arise about what interventions (transfer, tocolysis, antenatal corticosteroids, antibiotics, electronic fetal monitoring, cesarean delivery) should be offered. Decisions must be made about initial resuscitation and continuing intensive care, should the periviable neonate survive. In 2013, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the Section on Perinatal Pediatrics of the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists convened a joint workshop to consider the many issues surrounding the birth of periviable infants. The workshop's report1 summarizes the benefits and risks of obstetric and neonatal interventions related to periviable birth, provides an outline for counseling parents, describes newborn infant outcomes after periviable birth, and outlines research and educational agendas for the care and treatment of these patients. Recommendations for treatment made by this expert panel were drawn from the available literature and by extrapolating from relevant studies. The “periviable period” is defined as delivery occurring from 20 weeks through 25 weeks and 6 days of gestation. For each of 3 gestational age categories, less than 22 weeks, 22 weeks and 1 day to 22 weeks and 6 days, and 23 weeks or more, recommendations are made for the use or nonuse of interventions, including corticosteroids, tocolytics, magnesium sulfate for neuroprotection, antibiotics for group B streptococcus prophylaxis or for premature rupture of membranes, electronic fetal monitoring, cesarean delivery, and aggressive neonatal resuscitation. In general, few peripartum interventions are recommended for consideration before the 23 weeks' mark, after which infants should be considered potentially viable. Aggressive neonatal resuscitation is not recommended before 22 weeks (only palliative care should be provided), or between 22 and 22 weeks and 6 days unless the fetus is potentially viable, but is recommended after 23 weeks (unless the fetus is nonviable). If a decision is made to pursue neonatal resuscitation, the periviable neonate's extreme immaturity and small size necessitate special considerations, such as enhancing placental transfusion by delaying cord clamping for up to 30 seconds, taking steps to prevent hypothermia, having the most experienced and skilled caregiver perform the intubation, and avoiding the need for chest compressions, if possible, by establishing effective ventilation. The report also details special considerations for the “golden hours” immediately following resuscitation, and the challenges of managing periviable infants into the first week of life. The report places a strong emphasis on counseling the parents in the case of a threatened periviable birth. Such counseling should be evidence-based, bidirectional, collaborative, and ongoing, according to the information needs of the parents and the evolving clinical situation. 1.

ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIES: FILLING OUR NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNITS The National Perinatal Association (NPA) recently called on reproductive endocrinologists and health insurance companies to reduce the health risks associated with in vitro fertilization procedures by increasing the use of the safer elective single embryo transfer technique, which is recommended by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. In a position statement, “Ethical Use of Assisted Reproductive Technologies,”1 the NPA also stresses the need for more transparent and multidisciplinary patient education, counseling, and informed consent about the potential consequences of assisted reproductive technology (ART) and multiple birth pregnancies, which can pose serious health, emotional, and financial risks to families. This position statement was prompted by the growing number of multiple births that result from ART pregnancies, far outnumbering the number of multiple births that occur naturally. The latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ART surveillance report reveals that of 61,564 babies born through ART in 2009, 46.4% were twins, triplets, or higher-order multiples. This contrasts with 3% of naturally conceived infants who are multiples.2 The NPA's position statement emphasizes that multiples born through ART often require lengthy neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) stays and have significant health sequelae. A recent study3 of ART and artificial insemination (AI) births in California supports this claim. Researchers analyzed the occurrence of prematurity, low birth weight, multiple gestations, stillbirths, and other care and outcome variables in women who conceived through ART/AI compared with women who conceived naturally, from 2009 to 2011. Among ART/AI pregnancies, there was a 4.5-fold increase in stillbirths, a 4-fold increase in cesarean sections, and a 4-fold increase in preterm birth. The rate of multiple gestations following ART/AI was 24 to 27 times higher compared with naturally conceived pregnancies. Maternal hospital stay and hospital charges were higher for women who conceived through ART/AI, as were infant hospital charges, whether the ART/AI pregnancy resulted in a singleton, twin, or triplet birth. A higher rate of fetal anomalies was found after ART/AI. The researchers concluded that families who seek ART/AI should be informed about the adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes and higher costs associated with ART/AI birth. 1.

THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA: STATE OF THE ART Therapeutic hypothermia is a neuronal rescue strategy used in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) with the aim of improving neurodevelopmental outcomes. Cooling (as it is commonly called) is an evolving intervention. It is typically applied according to the parameters tested in randomized trials, and as more data become available, these parameters may change. Recently, a workgroup was convened to assess the current state of the evidence about therapeutic hypothermia, identify gaps in knowledge, and provide a framework for the implementation of hypothermia in neonates with HIE. According to the report published by this group,1 hypothermia should be implemented in medical centers that are capable of providing comprehensive clinical care, including mechanical ventilation; physiologic (vital signs, temperature) and biochemical (blood gas) monitoring; neuroimaging (including MRI); seizure detection and monitoring with amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) or electroencephalography (EEG); neurologic consultation; and a system for monitoring longitudinal neurodevelopmental outcome. Infants who undergo hypothermia should meet inclusion criteria (a pH of ≤7.0 or a base deficit of ≥16 mmol/L in an umbilical cord sample or blood obtained during the first hour after birth), history of an acute perinatal event, a 10-minute Apgar score of less than 5, or assisted ventilation initiated at birth and continued for at least 10 minutes. A neurologic examination should indicate moderate to severe encephalopathy. If preferential head cooling is used, abnormal background activity on either EEG or aEEG also is required. The report emphasizes that training programs and infrastructure need to be established and maintained in a highly organized and reproducible manner to ensure patient safety. Centers offering hypothermia should have written protocols and monitor management and outcomes. Outreach education is an essential component to ensure the timely identification of infants at risk for HIE and the prevention of extreme hypothermia and hyperthermia. Cooling of infants born at less than 35 weeks' gestation, those with mild HIE, and cooling for longer than 72 hours or at temperatures other than those used in clinical trials should not take place outside of research settings. Whether cooling should be initiated at a community hospital or on transport was not definitively addressed by this report. Although research on cooling on transport or before admission to the center offering therapeutic hypothermia was described in the report, this issue is considered as an area of uncertainty at this time. 1.

SNAPSHOT OF THE NURSE PRACTITIONER WORKFORCE In 2012, a survey of nurse practitioners1 (NPs) was conducted by the US Health Resources Service Administration to provide the latest nationally representative estimates of the supply of NPs in the United States and to collect detailed data on the licensure, education, clinical practice characteristics, and demographics of NPs. The survey was sent to a random sample of 22,000 licensed NPs, representing every state and the District of Columbia. The response rate was 60.1%. In 2012, there were an estimated 154,000 licensed NPs in the United States. Of these, more than 132,000 worked in a position requiring an NP credential, making up the current NP workforce. Within the NP workforce, 127,000 NPs were providing patient care, and nearly half of them (60,407) were working in primary care settings. Of the 22,000 licensed NPs who were not working in an NP position at the time of the survey, approximately 11,000 were working as registered nurses. Most (94%) of the NP workforce held a graduate degree (86% master's in nursing, 5% doctoral degree, and 3% a nonnursing graduate degree). Nearly all of the NP workforce (96%) have held formal certification from a national certifying organization at some point in their careers. The most widely held certification is family NP, reported by almost half of the NP workforce. Many older NPs are still in practice. The average age of NPs in 2012 was 48 years. The largest-age cohort of NPs, 55- to 59-year-olds, represented nearly 18% of the total NP workforce, and those 60 years of age and older represented 16%. Only 7% of NPs were male. Almost all of the NP workforce were in clinical practice (96%) providing direct patient care. Nonclinical roles included faculty (3%) and administration (1%). Nurse practitioners working in patient care provide various services, from patient education to medical procedures. More than 75% of NPs reported providing counseling and educating patients; conducting physical examinations and obtaining medical histories; prescribing drugs; and ordering, performing, and interpreting diagnostic studies. Fewer NPs reported performing procedures and making referrals. By far, the most common specialty of practice for NPs was primary care. Neonatal care was reported as the practice setting of 3% of respondents. Nurse practitioners providing patient care reported various collaborative arrangements with physicians, depending on state laws and the nature of the NP's role. About 11% worked in a setting without a physician on site, but more than half reported working in a setting with a physician most of the time. Nurse practitioners who worked in hospitals reported the most physician presence. Most of NPs (95%) who provide patient care had a National Provider Identifier number, although not all report using their National Provider Identifier for billing. Salaries of NPs varied substantially depending on role, setting, and specialty. Nurse practitioners in patient care reported earning a median of $87,500 annually in 2012. Those in surgical specialties earned the highest salaries (median $100,000), and primary care NPs earned the lowest (median $82,000). Nurse practitioners in faculty roles reported earning a median salary of $80,000 in 2012. In general, NPs reported high levels of job satisfaction. Overall, 92% of NPs were “satisfied” or “very satisfied” with their position. When specific elements of the job were examined, NPs were most satisfied with their level of autonomy, time spent in patient care, sense of value for what they do, and respect from physician colleagues and other colleagues. Nurse practitioners were least satisfied with the amount of paperwork required, administrative support, and input into organizational or practice policies. Nurse practitioners in the workforce were generally satisfied that their duties reflected the full scope of their NP capabilities and allowable scope of practice. Of those whose main position involves direct patient care, almost 84% agreed that they “practice to the fullest extent of the state's legal scope of practice,” and 89% agreed that their “NP skills are fully utilized.” 1.

Rockville, MD: US Department of Health and Human Services; 2014. MISUSE OF VIALS The Joint Commission wants healthcare providers to stop reusing single-dose injectable drug vials.1 At least 49 outbreaks of infections have occurred among recipients of injectable drugs taken from vials that were intended for single-use only. Single-use vials typically do not contain any preservatives and can easily become contaminated. Entering these vials more than once, regardless of technique or whether it is for the same or a different patient, poses a high risk for infection. The misuse of vials has occurred in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Some healthcare providers compromise safe infection-control practices in attempts to prevent waste, to conserve the supply of drugs during medication shortages, or to reduce costs. However, any cost savings so achieved can quickly be offset by the adverse clinical outcomes associated with unsafe injection practices. Injectable vial misuse has transmitted blood-borne pathogens and bacteria, causing infections in thousands of patients, including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, meningitis, and epidural abscesses. Some patients died from these infections, and many others required prolonged or life-long treatment. Patients with underlying health conditions are at even greater risk for harm. The adverse outcomes of unsafe injection practices have significant legal and financial ramifications as well. Appropriate use of single-dose/single-use injectable drug vials includes the following: Use single-dose/single-use vials only for a single patient during the course of a single procedure. Discard the vial after this single use; used vials should never be returned to stock on clinical units, drug carts, anesthesia carts, etc. If a single-dose/single-use vial must be entered more than once during a single procedure for a single patient to achieve safe and accurate titration of drug dosage, use a new needle and a new syringe for each entry. Single-dose/single-use vials opened in less than ISO Class 5 air quality must be used within 1 hour, with any remaining contents discarded. Single-dose/single-use vials opened in ISO Class 5 air quality can be used up to 6 hours. Do not combine or pool leftover contents of single-dose/single-use vials. Do not store used single-dose/single-use vials for later use, regardless of the size of the vial. Appropriate use of multiple-dose injectable drug vials includes the following: Only vials clearly labeled by the manufacturer for multiple dose use can be used more than once. Limit the use of a multiple-dose vial to only a single patient, whenever possible, to reduce the risk of contamination. When multiple-dose vials are used more than once, use a new needle and new syringe for each entry. Do not leave needles or other objects in vial entry diaphragms between uses, as this may contaminate the vial's contents. Disinfect the vial's rubber septum before piercing by wiping (and using friction) with an approved antiseptic. Allow the septum to dry before inserting a needle or other device into the vial. Once a multiple-dose vial is punctured, it should be assigned a “beyond-use” date. The beyond-use date for an opened or entered (eg, needle-punctured) multiple-dose container with antimicrobial preservatives is 28 days, unless otherwise specified by the manufacturer. All vials (single-dose/single-use and multiple-dose) should be discarded if sterility has been compromised or is questionable, including having been placed on a used procedure tray or used during an emergency procedure—even if the vial is unopened/unused. Select the smallest vial necessary when making purchasing and treatment decisions to reduce waste. Urge manufacturers to produce vials in appropriate sizes to reduce waste. In the NICU, it is difficult to find vial sizes that do not involve significant waste after the tiny dose needed has been extracted, but to protect our babies, we must learn to toss the vial. 1.

    "abstract": "WHAT IS THAT RED BIRTHMARK? “Birthmarks” are common in newborns. They can perplex clinicians and provoke anxiety on the part of parents. Which red mark is just a “nevus simplex” or “salmon patch” that is destined to disappear? Vaguely descriptive terms such as “strawberry hemangiomas,” “Angel's kisses,” and “port wine stains” have been used for many years to describe vascular anomalies, but their days, it appears, are numbered. A new, uniform classification scheme for vascular anomalies (vascular tumors and vascular malformations) developed by the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) aims to standardize the terminology of the “angiomas.”1 A common terminology and accurate diagnosis are crucial for appropriate evaluation and management of vascular lesions. Furthermore, a new classification recognizes the advances in understanding of the genetic mutations and molecular pathways involved in vascular lesions. The new, official ISSVA classification of vascular anomalies is an interactive document and is available at www.issva.org. State-of-the-art information about the most common, as well as the rarer vascular anomalies, with up-to-date terminology is presented, including genetic causes (where known) and associated syndromes. It is an excellent reference when a neonate presents with anything from a simple birthmark to a more serious vascular entity, or even with the most common benign vascular tumor of infancy, infantile hemangioma. 1.

IS NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE OVERUSED? A recent epidemiologic study1 concludes that newborns in the United States are increasingly likely to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and these units are caring for more normal-birth-weight and term infants. This conclusion was reached after an analysis of birth certificates of nearly 18 million liveborn infants from 38 states and the District of Columbia between 2007 and 2012. They found that throughout that 6-year period, the NICU admission rate increased from 64.0 to 77.9 per 1000 live births (relative rate, 1.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-1.22; P < .001). Admission rates increased for all birth-weight categories. The increase in admission rates to NICUs is not solely a consequence of an increase in the birth rate of premature or low birth-weight infants. In fact, during the study period, newborns admitted to NICUs were, on average, larger and less premature, such that by 2012, more than half of newborns admitted to an NICU had birth weights more than 2500 g. NICU care is costly and is not without potential harms to the infant and family, not the least of which are the separation, delayed attachment, and parental distress and anxiety prompted by an NICU admission. The investigators believe that their data raise the possibility of overuse of neonatal intensive care in some newborns, although the study does not allow for any assessment of the reasons for, or the appropriateness of NICU admission for any newborn. Further study is needed to determine the causes of the increased NICU use found in this study, as well as the implications for payers, policymakers, families, and newborns. 1. Harrison W, Goodman D. Epidemiologic trends in neonatal intensive care, 2007-2012 [published online ahead of print July 27, 2015]. JAMA Pediatr. doi: 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2015.1305. CHOOSING WISELY: NEONATAL EDITION In 2012, the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation launched the Choosing Wisely initiative, with a goal of advancing a national dialogue on avoiding wasteful or unnecessary medical tests, treatments, and procedures. In subsequent years, leading medical specialty societies generated evidence-based lists of common tests, treatments, and procedures that should not be routinely applied in their specific fields of healthcare. Now, neonatal medicine has joined the Choosing Wisely family.1 Dr Timmy Ho from the Beth Israel Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, and colleagues recruited a panel of experts (including representatives from NANN) to undergo a 2-year process to reach consensus on a list of 5 tests and procedures that should no longer be considered routine in neonatal care: Avoid routine use of antireflux medications for treatment of symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease or for treatment of apnea and desaturation in preterm infants. Avoid routine continuation of antibiotic therapy beyond 48 hours for initially asymptomatic infants without evidence of bacterial infection. Avoid routine use of pneumograms for predischarge assessment of ongoing and/or prolonged apnea of prematurity. Avoid routine daily chest radiographs without an indication for intubated infants. Avoid routine screening term-equivalent or discharge brain magnetic resonance imaging scans in preterm infants. These 5 interventions are not necessarily the most expensive tests or procedures used in neonatal care, but in the judgment of the expert panel, the available evidence of benefit does not justify their use. Although there may be specific instances when these 5 tests and treatments are still appropriate, their use should not be automatic or routine in neonatal care. The investigators intend this list to provide some specific opportunities to provide better, higher-value neonatal care, and hope that it is used as a starting point by neonatal intensive care units to evaluate other interventions that are used routinely, but offer little value or benefit to babies. 1.

Pediatrics. doi: 10.1542/peds.2015-0737. A SIMPLE WAY TO REDUCE FALSE-POSITIVE NEWBORN SCREENS False-positive newborn screening (NBS) results are a significant problem in neonatal care, especially among preterm infants. In recent years, the practice of starting amino acid infusions on the first day of life has increased rates of NBS that come back positive because of elevated amino acid concentrations. However, we can't assume that the infant doesn't have a true metabolic disorder, so these tests must be repeated and reevaluated, sometimes causing anxiety on the part of parents. A recent large, retrospective cohort study confirmed that this problem might have a simple solution1. The new strategy was to interrupt the neonate's parenteral nutrition infusion and substitute an equivalent concentration of dextrose for 3 hours before the blood for the NBS was drawn. Data on false-positive neonatal screens were compared before and after this new protocol was implemented. The new protocol had a dramatic effect on the false-positive rate, which was 74% lower in infants whose amino acid infusions were stopped before the NBS was drawn. The new strategy also resulted in a significant cost savings ($17.27 per infant screened or $192.54 for each false-positive NBS prevented). The only extra cost taken into account for implementing the new protocol was the cost of the 3-hour dextrose replacement fluid. These findings were very similar to those of a smaller study, using an almost identical protocol, published last year.2 Future research should determine whether less than 3 hours might be equally effective or whether a longer period of stopping parenteral nutrition might produce an even greater reduction in false-positive NBS results. Methods to prevent false-positive NBS results from abnormal 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentrations and acylcarnitine profiles in preterm infants are also needed. 1.

MORE NURSING PILLOW-RELATED INFANT DEATHS Improper use of a popular type of crescent-shaped pillow used by breastfeeding mothers has been implicated in the deaths of 3 infants in central Pennsylvania.1 The coroner who investigated the infant deaths believes that the infants died because the pillows were misused as devices to position or prop up sleeping infants. The infants died from “posture asphyxiation” when their heads gradually slipped down into the curve of the pillow, and then dropped forward, obstructing their airways. These 3 infant deaths were not the first associated with using a nursing pillow for infant naps. The nursing support pillows were not manufactured for the purpose of positioning infants during sleep, and they carry warnings against doing so. They are designed to encircle the mother's waist, providing a surface to comfortably support the breastfeeding infant while the mother is awake and holding the infant. These nursing pillows are often used while infants are still in the neonatal intensive care unit, offering an opportunity for nurses to educate mothers about the dangers of using the pillows in any way other than that for which they are intended, and to reinforce safe sleeping recommendations. Nurses must also take care not to use the pillows to position hospitalized babies during sleep, because these actions may be modeled by parents at home.",

Small Grant Awards The purpose of NANN's small grant program is to build the research capacity of neonatal nurses. Through a productive mentor-mentee relationship, this award provides neonatal nurses who have not been previously engaged in writing research proposals or who have not obtained research funding to begin a research project in an area of interest. The following are the 2014 small grant recipients.Small Grant Award—Research Based: Carrie Ellen Briere, RN“A Mixed Methods Feasibility Study to Identify Pluripotent Stem Cells in Mothers' Breastmilk for Premature Infants”Small Grant Award—Research Based: Ann Phalen, PhD, CRNP, NNP-BC“Cerebral and Splanchnic Oxygenation in Premature Neonates Concomitant With Nasogastric Feedings”Small Grant Award—Research Based: Ashley Weber, BSN, RN“Oxytocin: Biomarker of Affiliation and Neurodevelopment in Premature Infants”Chapter of the Year Award: Southeastern Michigan ChapterThe 2014 Chapter of the Year recipient is the Southeastern Michigan Chapter (SMANN). The chapter has retained 83 members in the past year and provided them with the opportunity to earn up to 8 contact hours through various offerings during the course of the year. Their largest educational event, the annual conference, included information about bereavement, partnering with parents, neonatal abstinence, and collaboration. With delegates representing 10 NICUs in the greater Detroit Area, the SMANN uses many forms of communication—from electronic methods, such as Facebook, listservs, and their Web site, to exhibiting at external conferences using a display board affectionately called “Bernie,” to keep their members and others abreast of their activities. The chapter is passionate about giving back both to their profession and the community they serve. A yearly Texas Hold ‘Em Tournament, Garage sale, and Baby Shower for charity are organized by chapter leaders. Throughout the year, the SMANN has also conducted collections for personal items, which are donated to a local temporary shelter, school supplies benefitting low-income families, and Christmas toys for the homeless. Through these various efforts, the SMANN deserves to be recognized as Chapter of the Year.Membership Recruitment and Retention Award: South Eastern Florida Chapter (SEFANN)This year, the South Eastern Florida Chapter (SEFANN) is awarded the Membership Recruitment and Retention Award. The SEFANN continues to have one of the lowest cost chapters at just $15 per year. The SEFANN's membership includes members from 40 zip codes.

    "abstract": "UNDERSTANDING THE NICU The American Academy of Pediatrics has a new book that is available now titled Understanding the NICU: What Parents of Preemies and Other Hospitalized Newborns Need to Know. Several professional neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) staff partnered with 14 families with the primary intention to provide hope and guidance to other parents of NICU babies. These family stories cover various scenarios and experiences of having children in the NICU. For example, one story covers 24-week twin daughters, Holland and Eden, and their long journey not only during their NICU stay but some of the realistic struggles at home for many months and years after their births. Another story shares a late preterm birth and a much shorter stay in the NICU. The book not only includes family stories but chapters covering basic NICU information to educate parents during their time in a new environment. Topics covered in the instructive chapters review topics including parenting, feeding, and common medical problems. The book is 288 pages long and has a retail price less than $20, which makes it an inexpensive option to consider having around your NICU to help educate and uplift parents during their downtime in the NICU. GLAUCOMA AND ZIKA Earlier this year the American Academy of Ophthalmology wrote a clinical statement expressing concern for other infants exposed to the Zika virus in utero due to multiple ophthalmic issues including macular pigment mottling, optic nerve hypoplasia, and iris coloboma discovered in previous Zika-exposed infants.1,2 A recent article published in the Ophthalmology journal discusses a new finding of glaucoma 3 months after birth in a Zika-exposed infant during gestation.3 Glaucoma results in damage to the optic nerve due to increased ocular pressure and is often caused by the inability for the eye to drain ocular fluid properly. Glaucoma is considered a rare occurrence in pediatric patients,4 but those individuals caring for infants known to be potentially exposed to the Zika virus in utero should be aware of glaucoma as well as the other potential ophthalmic issues that can present themselves during their hospital stay. Common signs of pediatric glaucoma include increased tearing,3,4 swelling and pain,3 and a dullness of the iris upon visual assessment.4 Once glaucoma is detected, the primary goal is to reduce intraocular pressure and secondarily, treat any signs of vision loss due to the aggressiveness of this disease. In the NICU, premature infants are routinely scheduled for eye exams. In addition to the premature infants, those infants who have a known or suspected history of Zika virus exposure are scheduled for an initial eye examination within the first month of life to reduce long-term sequelae.5 LACK OF PARENTAL FOLLOW-THROUGH WITH SIDS RISK FACTORS It goes without saying that parent teaching before sending an infant home should include information about and methods to reduce sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Along with potential health issues of an infant, environmental factors may also contribute to a SIDS occurrence. After videotaping parents and full-term infants at home one night when the infant was 1, 3, and 6 months of age, researchers at Penn State recognized a disconnect between parental knowledge and actions. Parents were aware of the videotaping and yet 14% of infants were placed in a position other than supine and 21% of infants laid on a sleep surface not recommended,6 which often includes soft surfaces such as couches, pillows, and waterbeds.7 What was more surprising to learn was over 90% of these infants had items within their environment like stuffed animals, pillows, and loose blankets. Although parents who participated in this study were considered above average on educational level and socioeconomic status, parents infrequently followed SIDS prevention methods.6 These results highlight the realistic force neonatal nurses are up against in teaching parents the importance of preventing SIDS. Considerations for new approaches to teach SIDS prevention are urgently needed to reduce infant mortality once infants are discharged home. The next time SIDS education is reviewed in your NICU, what changes would you propose to increase compliance with safety measures to reduce SIDS?",

    "abstract": "THE MILLENNIAL GENERATION AND THE FUTURE OF NEONATAL NURSING: A SPOTLIGHT ON NANN MEMBER KRISTIN HOWARD, DNP, MS, NNPKristin Howard, DNP, MS, NNPMillennials represent approximately 81 million individuals and are the most educated and diverse generation of young adults in American history, according to a recent Pew Research study. They are motivated individuals who value relationships and are not afraid of change. This generation will replace the baby boomers as they retire. NANN/NANNP member and neonatal nurse practitioner (NNP) Kristin Howard is one of those young adults representing the millennial generation. Kristin always wanted to work in healthcare. Nursing is in her blood; in fact, Kristin is a fourth-generation nurse. A school assignment cemented her decision to pursue nursing as her career. After graduating from the University of Missouri–St Louis, Kristin worked as a new graduate nurse in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and knew immediately that this specialty would be her focus. Demonstrating the high education standards of the millennial generation, Kristin never questioned her career choice. She states, “I am privileged to care for infants who can fit in the palm of my hand. I'm there when they come into this world and I get to be there when they leave the hospital to head out into the real world.” Kristin graduated with her bachelor's of science in nursing degree and immediately knew she wanted to pursue her master's degree as an NNP. Kristin said she would not be content without a terminal degree in nursing. She graduated with her master's degree in nursing as an NNP from Regis University in 2009. She went on to pursue her doctor of nursing practice (DNP), graduating from the University of Minnesota in 2013. True to her generation, Kristin was motivated to make changes and describes her DNP capstone project as one of the moments that she is most proud of. Kristen used a mentor relationship with a colleague to form her capstone project of delayed cord clamping (DCC) in the preterm infant. The colleague became not only a mentor but also an essential team member throughout the project. Together, they developed an evidence-based protocol that has changed the standard of delivery room care at the hospital that Kristin works in. She has gone on to share the DCC protocol with other facilities in her area. She states, “I feel privileged to have the opportunity to work with such a talented group of clinicians and to be a part of making a change that has led to the improvement in the outcomes of some of the most fragile infants.” Kristin feels the entire project was a labor of love over the past 2 years. She learned not only about DCC but also what it takes to make a change and how one small idea can have a significant impact. Kristin reflects that being part of developing and implementing those standards, so simple in theory and so motivating, opens the door to so many other opportunities for the DNP-prepared NNP. Relationships with mentors and family have had a significant impact on Kristin. Developing relationships have been an important part of Kristin's professional development. Her mother is a nurse and stressed the importance of belonging to a professional association. Kristin joined NANN in 2006, and it is her goal to be a more active member and to influence the future of her profession. Kristin feels she could not have done what she did without a community of support, family, coworkers, and her professional organization. The path was not always easy. Kristin describes times when she did not feel supported because of her young age. Having obtained her MSN at the age of 25 years and her DNP at the age of 29 years she was often the youngest in her class. She hopes that NANN/NANNP will develop a network of support for young nurses who are passionate about NICU care to go on and further their education. She states that “millennials are highly motivated and should be encouraged, not criticized, for wanting to advance their education.” Kristin is a young leader who believes in leading by example. She holds herself to a high standard and wants to encourage new neonatal nurses and advanced practice nurses by being a mentor and a teacher. Kristin admits to feeling a little overwhelmed at the idea of pursuing national leadership positions with NANN/NANNP but she is open to all opportunities. “My future as an NNP has many exciting possibilities!” PHARMACOLOGY WEBINAR SERIES Are You in Need of Pharmacology Hours?

More than 650 attendees—traveling from as far away as Australia—gathered at the Phoenix Convention Center in Phoenix, Arizona, on September 10–13, 2014, for NANN's 30th Annual Educational Conference. Attendees had the opportunity to experience a content-rich meeting packed with exciting clinical and research sessions. The educational program included 24 concurrent sessions, 15 paper sessions, 4 interprofessional sessions, and 3 general sessions. Fifty attendees experienced the first annual speed networking event, a spin-off from the popular speed dating concept. Attendees had the opportunity to connect with 8–10 peers during an entertaining hour-long session. This year, nearly 140 exhibitors provided attendees access to state-of-the-art products, services, and information pertinent to the demands of neonatal nurses. Attendees and exhibitors posted their conversations and photos about the annual conference to Facebook and Twitter. Followers were encouraged to use #NANN14 in their posts when referencing the annual conference. We hope you will continue to share your conference photos and thoughts with us through social media. NANN hopes to see you and your colleagues at next year's conference in Dallas, Texas, filled with big ideas and opportunities, October 22–25, 2015. CONNECTING In an effort to better connect with neonatal nurses, NANN launched a blog, “Neonatal Connection,” in August. “Neonatal Connection” provides readers with personal stories, advice, and nursing inspiration for members and the younger generation of neonatal nurses. Readers got an inside look of conference attendees' experiences during NANN's annual conference. Those writers who attended conference shared their “day in the life” perspective with readers, including thoughts on educational sessions and free time. NANN bloggers include Courtney Prewitt, Carrie-Ellen Briere, Kristin Howard, Kristina Johnson, and NANN President Pam Spivey. The blog will also feature guest bloggers on occasion. Since launch, the blog has had more than 2000 page views and continues to reach audiences through Facebook. Read “Neonatal Connection” at http://neonatalconnection.weebly.com. EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES To remain a primary resource for evidence-based products, NANN and NANNP released 3 new resources in 2014. NANN continues to provide education through various new delivery systems such as webinars and interactive online learning modules. The Discharge Pathway In August 2014, NANN released Baby Steps to Home, which provides nurses with a standardized discharge pathway for their patients. The free, online, evidence-based resource was created to standardize the discharge pathway and parent teaching that happens during the baby's stay in the neonatal intensive care unit and after the family is sent home. Baby Steps to Home provides parents with information appropriate to their baby's condition and progress toward discharge. The learning module includes 10 steps of discharge covering 25 topics, downloadable evidence-based PDFs for nurses, and parent handouts in English and Spanish. Learn more at www.babystepstohome.com. NNP Competencies The expanded second edition of Competencies and Orientation Toolkit for Neonatal Nurse Practitioners debuted at NANN's annual conference. The 90-page toolkit establishes consistent expectation concerning competencies for NNPs at varying levels of experience. This edition also offers methods of evaluating competencies to ensure that NNPs possess the knowledge, skill, and clinical judgment required for providing safe and effective care. It includes downloadable documents, including a full PDF of the book and Word documents of all the appendices. Purchase your copy today at http://www.nannstore.org. Pharmacology Education To address the need of pharmacology education, NANN introduced the Pharmacology Webinar Series in May 2013.

These prestigious awards are given to the best and brightest in the neonatal nursing field, in the areas of clinical practice, outstanding service, career achievement, leadership, neonatal nurse practitioner (NNP) excellence, NANN chapter recognition, and more. Award recipients were recognized at the 2015 NANN Annual Educational Conference in October. Lifetime Achievement Award: Robin Bissinger, PhD, APRN, NNP-BC, FAAN Robin Bissinger, PhD, APRN, NNP-BC, FAAN, is the recipient of the 2015 NANN Lifetime Achievement Award. Robin has been nationally recognized for her work on the Golden Hour of care for very low birth-weight infants. “She developed guidelines and designed the first interprofessional complex simulation model for care of these infants to improve neonatal outcomes,” her nominators wrote. She shared evidence-based standards of practice to enable the successful implementation of the Golden Hour nationally while guest editing NANN's journal Advances in Neonatal Care and disseminated the Golden Hour practice guidelines to all neonatal units in South Carolina, improving infant mortality rates from 9/1000 infant deaths per live birth to 6.9/1000 in just 12 years. Robin was coeditor of the workbook Golden Hours: Care of the Very Low Birth Weight Infant, which sold out within weeks of its 2014 release. She has written or coauthored numerous pieces for industry publications, including Advances in Neonatal Care.Lifetime Achievement Award: Robin Bissinger, PhD, APRN, NNP-BC, FAANRobin served as president of NANN from 2004 to 2006. As immediate past president, she helped establish NANNP in 2007. Furthermore, she has advocated for and achieved recognition of neonates as a specific population focus for nurse practitioners in the consensus model for APRN Licensure, Accreditation, Certification, and Education (LACE). She has been honored by numerous organizations, including twice by NANN as a Distinguished Leader. She is a member or leader for several professional organizations and associations and hospital and university committees. She has presented internationally for many conferences and organizations on topics including the Golden Hour, quality improvement, and certification. While serving as director of the NNP Program in the College of Nursing at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), Robin drafted the first NNP competency guidelines, which are now the national standard. She became director of the graduate program at MUSC and developed the doctor of nursing practice (DNP) program. In 2015, MUSC was ranked first among online nursing graduate programs by U.S. World and News Report. Today, she serves as executive director of the National Certification Corporation and continues to practice clinical nursing as an NNP at MUSC. Distinguished Service Award: Donna Dowling, PhD, RNDistinguished Service Award: Donna Dowling, PhD, RNThe recipient of the Distinguished Service Award is Donna Dowling, PhD, RN. The Distinguished Service Award recognizes outstanding and dedicated service to NANN by honoring an individual who has advanced the mission of the association in a significant and lasting way. Donna has been an active NANN member for more than 3 decades. She has served on the Research Committee, as a member of the Research Institute, as a NANN Small Grant reviewer, and since 2010, she has been the research section editor for the NANN journal Advances in Neonatal Care. “In my opinion, it is Dr. Dowling's tireless efforts as research section editor that most earn her an award for distinguished service to the organization,” wrote one of her nominators. “She spends countless hours reviewing manuscripts as well as reviewer comments, making thoughtful and constructive recommendations for strengthening submitted manuscripts so that every manuscript submission is carefully considered for publication.” Donna began her career as a labor and delivery nurse and today is an associate professor and director of the postmaster's DNP program at the Frances Payne Bolton School of Nursing at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. At the NANN Research Summit and throughout her career, Donna has mentored potential authors—students, novice investigators, and neonatal clinicians—by encouraging them, helping them to hone needed skills, and assisting with the submission of manuscripts. A member of several professional associations, Donna has served many roles in these groups, including as a manuscript reviewer and a grant reviewer. She has submitted and been awarded many grants. She has authored or coauthored numerous articles and book chapters and has presented numerous presentations on neonatal topics. She has served on many dissertation and DNP thesis committees and has served many roles in school and university positions. Robyn Main Excellence in Clinical Practice Award: Michelle Nicoli, RNC-CRNP IVRobyn Main Excellence in Clinical Practice Award: Michelle Nicoli, RNC-CRNP IVMichelle Nicoli, RNC-CRNP IV, a clinical nurse for more than 20 years, is the recipient of the Robyn Main Excellence in Clinical Practice Award, which honors an individual who recognizes and encourages excellence in neonatal nurses who provide direct patient care. She has concentrated on maternal child nursing for the past 21 years and describes herself as “strongly motivated by the possibility of executing positive change.” Nowhere is this more on display than within the Davis Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, Massachusetts, where Michelle is a neonatal abstinence resource nurse who works almost exclusively with infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome. There, Michelle identified a need for more developmentally supportive equipment to console her patients, researched options, and found funding for Mamaroo motion seats and white noise machines. To facilitate infants' sleep, she developed signage to alert staff to the need for quiet and spearheaded a system that coordinates examinations with the attending physicians during times when infants are awake. Michelle empowers families to actively participate in their babies' care, and interacts without judgment, despite the situations into which her patients were born. Michelle shares her expertise with staff by teaching classes and providing training, and she has participated in committees and conferences to share her knowledge. “Where others find roadblocks, Michelle perseveres to find a way to elevate our standard practices,” her nominator wrote. “She is a truly genuine and compassionate nurse. She is always willing to share her time, information and expertise.” Navigator Award: Shakira Henderson, PhD(c), DNP, MS, MPH, RNC-NIC, IBCLCNavigator Award: Shakira Henderson, PhD(c), DNP, MS, MPH, RNC-NIC, IBCLCThe Navigator Award has been bestowed upon Shakira Henderson, PhD(c), DNP, MS, MPH, RNC-NIC, IBCLC. The Navigator Award recognizes a person who demonstrates outstanding teaching and motivational skills, is clinically and technically skilled in his or her profession, and shares his or her experiences and viewpoints willingly. This person is also supportive, guiding, reassuring, and demonstrates the goals and ambitions of the professional nurse as a role model for others. Shakira embodies this through scholarly contributions to publications, mentored preceptorship, research, community outreach, practice, and education innovation. At South Miami Hospital in South Miami, Florida, Shakira was instrumental in developing and implementing the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) Breastaurant and orchestrated more than 10 nurses in the NICU becoming International Board Certified Lactation Specialists. This played a crucial role in the hospital becoming the second in the country to obtain Joint Commission Certification for Prematurity. She has served as a mentor for many nurses who are pursuing their BSN, MSN, and DNP degrees in neonatal nursing. Now a nurse scientist, she serves as a research mentor to NICU nurses. She guided successful grant requests for NICU projects, the first nursing grants in her hospital system. She has conducted research, quality improvement, and performance improvement projects to explore and solve quality issues in the NICU. Although not part of her job description, she continues to teach and guide nurses on topics such as breastfeeding for the betterment of the hospital and care provided. Her influence and efforts extend beyond her hospital system. She is an associate professor at Chamberlain College of Nursing. She has been published in several journals, presented at many educational conferences, earned a list of honors, participated in numerous professional organizations, and acted as principal investigator or coinvestigator on 8 research projects. Shakira is working with the Florida Prenatal Quality Collaborative to implement an NICU breastfeeding initiative statewide, participated in the NANN feeding guidelines work team, serves as the NANN Research Special Interest Group facilitator, and acts as a mentor for the 2014–2015 SigmaTheta Tau International Maternal-Child Leadership Academy. Leadership Award: Judy Vitali, BSN, RNC-NIC, CIME, CPFI, CHBELeadership Award: Judy Vitali, BSN, RNC-NIC, CIME, CPFI, CHBEThe Leadership Award recognizes a neonatal nurse who exhibits superior leadership skills and demonstrates consistent excellence in practice. Judy Vitali, BSN, RNC-NIC, CIME, CPFI, CHBE, is this year's recipient. Judy is a registered nurse, clinical level IV, in the 50-bed NICU at Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Judy and a coworker implemented an extensive and daunting parent education program for NICU families with classes on baby care, infant cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Happiest Baby on the Block, infant massage, cue-based feeding, preemie development, and breastfeeding. She recruited, oriented, and mentored coworkers to teach, and she designed and displayed posters to increase family participation. The program is being used as a hospital-wide Magnet Project that has demonstrated the increased knowledge and confidence experienced by intensive care nursery (ICN) families that go through her program. Staff and expectant parents also benefit from Judy's work. As a licensed basic life support (BLS), neonatal resuscitation program (NRP), and emergency first aid instructor, she has helped certify healthcare workers to teach infant/child CPR for both ICN families and the parent education department. Judy assists at the Penn Medicine Simulation Center by coteaching NRP and BLS courses. She created and instituted both the infant/child CPR class and pediatric first aid classes for the Pennsylvania Hospital Parent Education Department after families requested them. To take her mission beyond the health system, Judy purchased CPR mannequins, an automated external defibrillator trainer, and American Heart Association BLS/heartsaver/first aid DVDs for community outreach activities. This has allowed her to teach CPR and first aid at local churches, schools, daycare centers, YMCA facilities, and a maternal wellness center in Philadelphia. She also teaches prenatal/postnatal fitness and nutrition at local athletic centers. She participates in many hospital committees and organizations that benefit others, including the Nursing Practice Council and the Scheduling Committee, and chairs the Infant Nutrition Committee and Professional Development Committee. She was a member of the Toxigen Initiative QI Project for prevention of hyperoxia and its toxic effect in very preterm infants; project data were published in Advances in Neonatal Care. She has presented on that project and many other topics to further share her knowledge. Neonatal Nurse Practitioner Excellence Award: Suzanne Staebler, DNP, NNP-BC, FANNP Suzanne Staebler, DNP, NNP-BC, FANNP, is the recipient of the Neonatal Nurse Practitioner Excellence Award. The Neonatal Nurse Practitioner Excellence Award honors outstanding contributions by an NNP to the field of neonatal nursing through exemplary practice, leadership, service, and education.Neonatal Nurse Practitioner Excellence Award: Suzanne Staebler, DNP, NNP-BC, FANNPAt Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, Suzanne is assistant director of advanced practice nursing and adjunct faculty at the Vanderbilt School of Nursing. One nominator lauded her as “an extraordinary clinician and educator who epitomizes neonatal nursing at its finest. She is one of the most outstanding nurse practitioner advocates to emerge from NANN and the National Association of Neonatal Nurse Practitioners (NANNP) leadership. She has demonstrated exceptional leadership abilities, strategic thinking, and dedication to NANN and neonatal nursing for over 20 years.” Through her ongoing interdisciplinary consultation, research, and evidence-based practice projects, Suzanne has positively impacted the preterm population to reduce risks associated with life-threatening diseases. She is now at the forefront of helping the world understand that the risks associated with respiratory syncytial virus exposure to preterm neonates may be extremely harmful if not proactively and routinely immunized. Previously, she has led several rapid-cycle change projects: one to reduce the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis in very low birth-weight infants, utilizing donor human milk, and standardizing feeding protocols and another to reduce hypothermia in the delivery room. Pediatrix Medical Group is using both protocols nationally in its 100,000 Babies Campaign. Suzanne has significantly impacted the NNP profession through her involvement in NANNP. Her advocacy presence was instrumental in the LACE initiative and Advanced Practice Registered Nurse (APRN) Consensus Model development to maintain NNP practice as an independent and distinct advanced nursing practice specialty. During her tenure as NANNP governing chair, Suzanne coordinated efforts of NANNP task force members to revise and implement the current guidelines for NNP educational programs. She also has been instrumental in developing and coordinating the development and revision of neonatal nursing guidelines for standard of care. As NANNP chair, she has worked to align the NNP and clinical nurse specialist roles with the consensus model for APRNs. She was the project director for Baby Steps to Home, the guide that prepares NICU parents to take their children home. She recently was named a Fellow in the American Association of Nurse Practitioners, an honor bestowed on a small number of APRNs worldwide. Suzanne helped Emory University launch the only NNP program in Georgia—a state with one of the nation's highest infant mortality rates. She has presented and lectured nationally and has published her work in many journals. “She has dedicated her time to advocate for these babies in national forums and is a voice of reason for our families and the professional nurses that serve them,” another nominator wrote. “She gives of her time freely to ensure that the world is aware of issues that are impacting our profession.” Chapter of the Year Award: Central California ChapterChapter of the Year Award: Central California ChapterThe 2015 Chapter of the Year recipient, the Central California Chapter (CCANN), is no stranger to being recognized for hard work and success. Spanning 7 counties in the Central Valley, the CCANN strives to excel in education, communication, membership retention and recruitment, advocacy, community service, and fund-raising. The chapter takes great pride in its educational offerings, including the fall and regional conferences, lunch and learn, breakfast and learn, and many more. The revamped CCANN Web site (www.ccannurses.com) also links to educational resources that provide continuing education units and a medical journal article review by medical advisors. Presentations are made interactive to increase participation; a remote clicker system given to all participants has supported this effort. Feedback is taken seriously and has led to a 2015 goal of increasing the number of breakfast/luncheon conferences. Scholarships offered through CCANN have helped members attend the NANN Annual Educational Conference and pursue higher educational degrees. The chapter even offered a NANN membership and local conference fees to attendees of CCANN's fall conference. The chapter maintains open, up-to-date communication and transparency on the chapter's Web site and through e-newsletters and social media accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and YouTube. This reaches new members and enables current members to stay connected, stay informed, and be involved. In December 2014, CCANN initiated its first official chapter brochure and has begun collecting snippets of videos with the goal of producing a short promotional documentary representing the chapter's achievements and engagements. Although the chapter is one of the largest in the nation with more than 170 members, the leadership team is dedicated to increasing the chapter's membership by at least 10% each quarter. Prior to the April–May 2014 recruitment drive, flyers, and newsletters were sent to outlying hospitals with new and renewing members. Personal follow-ups and regular catch-ups with members and potential members increase engagement and recruitment. Other recruitment strategies have included reaching out to new staff during their NICU orientation and inviting new staff and nursing students to CCANN's breakfast and luncheon conferences. In 2014, CCANN donated more than $10,000 to community service organizations and foundations that align with the chapter's mission. Recipient organizations included March of Dimes, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the American Diabetes Foundation, Ronald McDonald House and Terry's House, and the Make A Wish Foundation. The chapter also contributed funds for toys for a clinic for high-risk infants, humanitarian outreach projects, a local food bank, a local shelter for domestic violence victims, underprivileged children who needed winter coats, and a local family experiencing pain and hardship. CCANN and its members promote advocacy through support and promotion of March of Dimes, family-centered care, breastfeeding, and more. CCANN has chosen a representative as advocacy liaison to keep members informed of upcoming advocacy opportunities and will continue to be active in advocacy in 2015. Advocacy, Communications, and Education Chapter Award: South Eastern Florida ChapterAdvocacy, Communications, and Education Award: South Eastern Florida ChapterThe South Eastern Florida Chapter (SEFANN) has earned the Advocacy, Communications, and Education Award. An advocacy general session at the NANN Annual Conference in Nashville, Tennessee, lit a fire under the officers of the SEFANN chapter. They shared what they'd learned with their members at a dinner meeting, in a newsletter, and in a new page on their Web site at www.sefann.org and created a new advocacy committee. The sections of the political self-assessment tool were turned into presentations, educating many and resulting in dozens of new members. When it comes to communicating with members, SEFANN uses its Web site and a Shutterfly site to keep members informed and share resources, photographs, and a calendar of events. Other communications include an e-newsletter sent 6 times a year; conference and meeting brochures and flyers mailed, e-mailed, posted in hospitals, and posted online; and thank-you notes and welcome letters sent to new and renewing members. Face-to-face communication occurs during chapter meetings, helping members build positive relationships with peers, and at the 2-day Hot Topics educational conference. Education is offered frequently. Six free dinners boast continuing education hours at local hospitals in the area, enabling nurses to satisfy education requirements for the year. The chapter's 19th annual regional conference, Hot Topics in the Tropics, had more than 60 attendees for each of the 2 days and offered 14 continuing education hours plus additional hours for poster reviews. Members can apply for educational scholarships and enter a raffle for NANN conference scholarships. The chapter posts conference and educational opportunities on its Web site to further expand the resources members can access. Community Service and Fundraising Award: Southeastern Michigan ChapterCommunity Service and Fundraising Award: Southeastern Michigan ChapterThe Community Service and Fundraising Award has been bestowed upon the Southeastern Michigan Chapter (SMANN). In 2014, the chapter gave back to the community through an assortment of projects. The Coalition for Temporary Shelter (COTS) in Detroit, Michigan, which provides emergency shelter to men, women, and children, received donated personal hygiene products, Easter baskets, winter clothing, and toys for Christmas gifts through the generosity of SMANN members. First-time mothers who attended the SMANN Annual Community Baby Shower in Detroit learned about car-seat safety, safe sleep practices, breastfeeding, and infant CPR and were able to choose pink, blue, or yellow extra-large gift bags full of sleepers, diapers, bibs, blankets, and adorable outfits—all given by members. In August, members and a local hospital donated items to be sold in the citywide garage sale in Dearborn Heights, Michigan. They raised more than $900 that was donated to Camp Michi-Mac, a camp for children with asthma. Unsold items from the garage sale were donated to local charities and libraries. At the start of the school year, members collected and donated school supplies for low-income families. SMANN's Texas Hold ‘Em fundraiser raised nearly $3700, which was donated to Camp Michi-Mac, Cribs for Kids in Detroit, the Foundation for Neonatal Research and Education, nursing scholarships, and the SMANN baby shower. Additional funds came from a wine-tasting event and donations from generous sponsors. Membership Recruitment and Retention Chapter Award: Delaware Valley Chapter The Delaware Valley Chapter (DVANN) earned the Membership Recruitment and Retention Chapter Award. In 2014, DVANN added more than 100 members to end the year at a membership of 246. The chapter attributes the growth to utilizing NANN's online dues payment system, saying it has been instrumental in supporting its recruitment and retention initiatives. In addition to keeping membership fees low, DVANN offers a free year of membership to members who recruit 2 nurses to the chapter. Members also hosted a recruitment table at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's Neonatal Symposium to inform attendees about the benefits of NANN and DVANN.Membership Recruitment and Retention Chapter Award: Delaware Valley ChapterTo retain existing members, leaders added more face-to-face networking opportunities, fun events, and recognition. For instance, a “mocktail” hour with conversation starters was added to a dinner meeting, and members have enjoyed outings to baseball games locally and at the NANN Annual Conference. A membership appreciation dinner held around National Neonatal Nurses' Day used assigned seating this year to enhance networking. The chapter's newsletter, The Preemie Press, highlights a member in each issue. Members are further recognized through the Professional Development Award, REACH Award, and International Nursing Award, each of which comes with a monetary award or free membership. Research Abstract Award: Kate McGinnis, BSN, RN-NIC Kate McGinnis, BSN, RN-NIC, is the recipient of the Research Abstract Award for the abstract “The Effect of Mechanical Vibration on Pain Response to Heel Stick.” Kate has worked as a nurse in the NICU at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston, Georgia, for 9 years and has served as chair of her unit's Developmental Care Council. She graduated with her BS in biochemistry from Warren Wilson College and her BSN from Kennesaw State University. Kate is a recipient of the DAISY Award for Extraordinary Nurses.

    "abstract": "MEET YOUR NANN VOLUNTEER: HEATHER GOODALL, PROGRAM PLANNING COMMITTEE CHAIRHeather Goodall, MSN RNC-NIC IBCLCNANN Program Planning Committee Chair, Heather Goodall, MSN RNC-NIC IBCLC, loves hearing the hallway conversations at conferences. “I get the most enjoyment from attending the conference and hearing the attendees say that they have really enjoyed the education offered,” she says. “The committee really tries hard to accomplish that, and it feels great to hear it being said!” Initially considering a career as a pediatrician and then opting for nursing because it required less schooling, Heather later discovered that she had a nursing legacy in her family. Her grandmother was a labor and delivery nurse and her aunt was a pediatric intensive care nurse. Heather graduated from Colorado Mesa University with a bachelor of science degree in nursing in 1998 and then pursued a master of science in leadership in healthcare systems with an educator track and a certificate in healthcare education from Regis University in 2009. She is certified as a lactation consultant and obtained her RNC-NIC designation in 2008. Heather credits many in her life for her success in nursing. She had nursing instructors who had high expectations and fellow nurses who were strong mentors and encouraged her to advance her education. Her patients and their families inspired her to obtain special certifications to be able to deliver the highest quality of care. Heather also credits her husband, mother, and extended family for their ongoing support as she continues to develop professionally. A member since 2006, Heather finds that NANN provides essential avenues that support the evolving professional nurse. NANN has supported my professional practice through the journal articles and annual educational conference. The information and education gleaned from these avenues has been very important. That's how change can be made and new ideas generated. Understanding where these changes come from helps as well. This support needs to continue for all neonatal nurses, not just new nurses. The networking that happens in the MyNANN community is also important, and I would encourage new nurses to just jump in and start following the conversations. It gives you a broader perspective on the neonatal care around the world. Heather believes nurses are never too young in their careers or too inexperienced to be involved in NANN. She encourages nurses of any experience level to share their fresh ideas and perspectives. NANN has many opportunities for nurses, including taskforces, committees, and projects. Heather became involved in the Program Planning Committee in 2010 because she happened to see an ad calling for members to join the committee. She signed up to be a moderator at the conference that same year. “I enjoy the educational aspect of nursing and thought it would be a great opportunity to help plan the conference,” she says. The experience of being on the committee has brought other opportunities to be involved in NANN through the networking with other members. Heather added the Education Committee to her growing list of NANN involvement and has worked on various taskforces and projects that she has enjoyed very much. When the request came for membership to submit their interest for the Program Planning Committee Chair Elect role, Heather took some time to decide if this would be the right path for her. After learning more about the position, she decided it was. “I was very excited and I still am. I love working on this committee with great members who are invested in creating a fabulous conference experience. I would have been sad to not be part of this group.” The responsibility of the Program Planning Committee Chair comes with challenges—as most rewarding experiences do. Heather identifies finding dynamic speakers for large audience-attended sessions and being able to communicate with members of the committee (spread out across the country) as her top 2 challenges. The distance barrier between committee members has been a good learning experience for all the participants. Heather shares that “we find ways to get things done electronically and over the phone, all before the deadlines!” She has learned about each member of the committee and their particular strengths that they bring to the group. Heather has developed goals for the committee that she strives to meet during her tenure. “My goals include making sure that there are topics available for all experience levels at the conference and recruiting speakers for the hot topics in various parts of the country,” she says, “as well as encouraging neonatal experts to share their research and evidence-based practice and supporting the networking of neonatal colleagues.” Heather says the support from the NANN administration has been tremendous; without them these goals would not be possible. Heather has embraced NANN opportunities to support her professional growth and development. She is not sure what is next for her professionally because she loves her current role as a NICU clinical educator. Heather reflects, “I have thought about next steps up the ladder for me, which might include being Director of Education, but I will have to see. I have a good part of my career ahead of me so anything is possible. That is what is so great about nursing!” REGISTER NOW FOR THIS YEAR'S ANNUAL CONFERENCE!FigureWe can't wait to see you in Dallas, Thursday, October 22—Sunday, October 25!

Her path to becoming the editor of NANN E-News was not direct, but in the end it was a perfect match between NANN's need for an editor and Tracey's desire to merge her 2 loves, nursing and writing. Tracey was always interested in pursuing a career in healthcare. She started her studies at the University of Oklahoma as a premed major. Although she loved biology, she soon realized that chemistry was going to be her nemesis. Tracey sought the advice of her father, who advised her to do what she loved, and around that time, she discovered that she loved writing. “On paper, I felt powerful and artistic,” she says. After graduating from college with a bachelor's of arts degree, Tracey's love of the mountains led her to Denver. She found the job market to be small and saturated because of large-scale layoffs in the journalism industry at the time. She says, “I found the world of publishing to be surprisingly uninterested in the opinions of a 23-year-old girl from Texas with almost no life experience!” The advice of a friend to consider nursing school seemed like a good idea to Tracey. It would fit with her love of healthcare and provide her with a career and comfortable income, and she reasoned, “working 3 days a week would give me time to craft my art as a writer.” Tracey completed an accelerated nursing program and in her words “fell deeply in love with nursing and forgot all about my writing dreams.” For Tracey, becoming an advanced practice nurse was not a matter of if but of when. She completed her master's degree at Regis University and began working at the Children's Hospital Colorado in the newborn intensive care unit. Tracey has had the fortune of many mentors and influential people in her life both professionally and personally. She says her husband keeps her grounded and has given her the courage to move forward professionally. Tracey's mom gave her unconditional support when she announced that she wanted to go to nursing school, and rather than advising her to salvage the degree she already had, encouraged her to go ahead and follow her heart. The instructors in nursing school and mentors in her neonatal nurse practitioner (NNP) program helped her develop confidence and as Tracey says, “showed me that I did indeed have the knowledge to make safe decisions for my patients.” The editor position for NANN E-News offered an exciting new challenge for Tracey. When the position opened up, the NANN board liaison to E-News encouraged Tracey to apply. The board member was already familiar with Tracey's unique background in journalism and nursing. Tracey said that she was honored to be considered for the position and to be in a position to provide a service to NANN members. Tracey feels her unique background coupled with her experience as a nurse and an NNP allows her to help nurses become published even if they are not completely comfortable with writing. Tracey spends a great deal of time at the NANN Annual Educational Conference, talking to poster and paper presenters looking for inspiring and educational stories. “They have already done the majority of work toward publication,” she says. “Nurses around the country are doing great things in their units and communities. They are working hard to improve their NICUs and to refine and streamline patient care. I simply help them tell these stories.” Tracey has many goals for E-News, but first and foremost, she hopes “that E-News provides an opportunity for nurses to feel connected to the national neonatal community. I hope that in addition to providing news updates, the feature article of each E-News issue offers either inspiration or education for nurses and does that for less than 10 minutes of reading investment.” The next project or step in Tracey's career is yet to be discovered. She is content working, learning every day, and enjoying the beauty of Colorado. Tracey realizes how important it is to have NANN's support in the ever-changing healthcare arena and is grateful for the opportunity to give back to NANN as the editor of E-News.

    "abstract": "NEONATAL ABSTINENCE SYNDROME PRECONFERENCE AND THE 32ND ANNUAL EDUCATIONAL CONFERENCE Did you know that every 25 minutes an opioid-exposed infant is born at risk for neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS)? Many neonatal intensive care units, step-down units, and newborn nurseries are struggling to care for this medically fragile and socially complex population. This year NANN is joining forces with Vermont Oxford Network to provide a preconference workshop on NAS. Together, we will take on the clinical challenges of NAS and promote improved quality, safety, and value of care for this vulnerable population of infants and families. You can register for the preconference on the NANN Web site (www.nann.org/conference). In addition to the NAS preconference, registration is also open for the 32nd Annual Educational Conference! The conference will be held in Palm Springs, California, from Wednesday October 26 to Saturday October 29 at the Renaissance Palm Springs and Palm Springs Convention Center. Each year NANN strives to provide high-quality education for conference attendees, as well as networking opportunities with members and exhibitors from across the nation. For the most up-to-date information on the conference lineup, please visit the NANN Web site. VIRTUAL LOBBY WEEK In March, NANN held its inaugural Virtual Lobby Week to provide nurses with the skills needed to become advocates for neonates and the neonatal nursing profession. Over the course of 5 days, the Health Policy and Advocacy Committee taught nurses about advocacy fundamentals—from best practices to the latest issues facing neonatal nurses. Each day members received an e-mail, with a lesson about advocacy with the goal to build skills and confidence as an advocate. The Health Policy and Advocacy Committee asked members to apply these skills by reaching out to their legislators to support Senate Bill 2041, which is also known as the Promoting Life-Saving Therapies for Neonates Act. This bill encourages the development of new therapies to ultimately improve the quality of treatment options available to premature newborns. The Promoting Life-Saving Therapies for Neonates Act would close the treatment gap by encouraging the development of safe and effective drugs for a challenging and often neglected patient population and ensure that new neonatal drugs address the most critical needs. ZIKA VIRUS In May 2015, the first case of Zika virus infection was reported in Brazil. Zika virus infection has since spread rapidly throughout the Caribbean and the Americas. The virus primarily is transmitted to people through an infected Aedes species mosquito. The most common symptoms are fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis. The illness is usually mild, with symptoms lasting for several days to a week after being bitten by an infected mosquito. The most concerning aspect of the virus is the effect on the developing fetus. A Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly, as well as pregnancy loss, eye defects, hearing loss, and impaired growth in infants. Since 2015, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have been working tirelessly to address this global health concern. The CDC is currently tracking the spread of Zika virus and other mosquito-borne viruses in the United States and around the world. They are training disease detectives to find and report Zika cases; teaching healthcare providers how to identify Zika cases; testing samples for Zika virus and providing laboratories with diagnostic tests; studying links between Zika virus infection, birth defects, and Guillain–Barré syndrome; educating the public about Zika virus infection; and advising travelers how to protect themselves while traveling in areas with Zika virus infection. In addition to the aforementioned efforts, the CDC has established the US Zika Pregnancy Registry to further gain information about the virus and is collaborating with state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments. This registry will allow officials to collect information about pregnancy and infant outcomes following Zika virus infection during pregnancy. The data collected will be used to update recommendations for clinical care, plan for services for pregnant women and families affected by Zika virus, and improve prevention of Zika virus infection during pregnancy. To find the most up-to-date information about the Zika virus infection and healthcare recommendations, visit the CDC Web site at www.cdc.gov/zika/index.html or the WHO Web site at www.who.int/emergencies/zika-virus/en. In addition to these resources, NANN has dedicated a page on its Web site for all the latest Zika virus information.",

    "abstract": "NANN is proud to be the professional voice for neonatal nurses. The organization enjoys continued success because of its outstanding members. NANN would like to share exciting highlights of several accomplishments that were achieved in the areas of membership, education, products, and research in 2013. MEMBERSHIP GROWTHNANN President Cheryl Ann Carlson, PhD, APRN, NNP-BC, celebrates NANN's membership growth at the 2013 Annual Educational Conference.Each year, NANN develops a Wildly Important Goal (WIG) based on Franklin Covey's 4 Disciplines of Execution. In 2013, NANN's WIG was to reach a total of 7777 members by year-end. NANN set this goal to ensure that NANN's peer network, voice, and resources were available to all neonatal nurses across the United States. NANN began 2013 with 7250 members, and these members were asked to assist the organization in achieving this goal. To support members as they worked to grow their professional association, NANN developed a group membership discount incentive and created a membership recruitment toolkit (also available at http://www.nann.org), which included sample recruitment e-mail templates, a slide presentation, a poster for the neonatal intensive care unit, and multiple membership pieces. These endeavors were highly successful as NANN reached 7921 members by September 30, 2013—9% growth! NANN members have made a difference to their neonatal nursing colleagues and contributed to enhancing the available resources to shape neonatal nursing through excellence in practice, education, research, and professional development. NANN thanks all members for sharing the value and benefits of the association with their peers, especially those who referred new members and renewed their own membership. With the success of 2013 behind us, NANN will continue to offer the group new member discount. Remember, with more NANN members and resources, you win, your colleagues win, and neonates and their families win. You still can participate in the group discount promotion and receive a referral discount bonus to use toward your next membership renewal. Visit http://www.nann.org/nicu for more information. ANNUAL EDUCATIONAL CONFERENCEConference attendees used the session handouts provided on NANN's Web site to engage during sessions at the 2013 Annual Educational Conference in Nashville, Tennessee.The 29th Annual Educational Conference brought nearly 750 attendees to Nashville, including 28 conference registration scholarship recipients. The 2013 conference program included dozens of exceptional speakers and a range of topics, which made decisions about which sessions to attend very difficult. The educational program included 2 preconference events, 25 concurrent sessions, 15 paper presentations, 4 interprofessional sessions, 4 general sessions, and 8 special interest group meetings. The conference also had 2 additional general sessions on advocacy and trauma-informed care and more than 150 exhibitors. We hope to see you at NANN's 30th Annual Educational Conference, September 10–13, 2014, in Phoenix for another educational, engaging, and inspiring conference. EVIDENCE-BASED RESOURCES NANN prides itself on being the primary source for educating neonatal nurses throughout their career. To maintain this status, NANN continues to provide accredited training and education through a variety of delivery systems and access to evidence-based resources that set the standards for practice.

NANN provides multiple avenues for members to conduct their research by offering educational grants for both the Annual Research Summit and the Small Grants Award Program. Through an educational grant from Mead Johnson Nutrition, NANN held its 8th Annual Research Summit in April. The summit offered neonatal nurses with advanced practice degrees who are currently engaged in research or evidence-based practice projects an opportunity to present their research or projects in a peer setting. NANN extended this opportunity to 15 individuals. NANN's small grants program provides an avenue for connecting those with little or no research background with experienced researchers to enhance their skills and promote the success of their research study or evidence-based practice project. In 2013, 4 small grants awarded to individuals who will present their findings at the 2016 Annual Educational Conference. For more information regarding research, visit http://www.nann.org/research. LOOKING FORWARD With a new year come new goals and a financial WIG. NANN is excited for the upcoming year and will continue to be the primary resource for neonatal nurses by providing new products, including the Preemie Health Coalition discharge module, Baby Steps to Home. Baby Steps to Home provides a complete discharge pathway to standardize nurse and parent teaching regarding the baby's stay in the NICU and progress toward discharge. The module includes evidence-based nurse content and parent handouts with easy-to-understand explanation of their baby's condition. The module will be available at no cost on a microsite in early 2014. NANN will continue to enhance available resources to shape neonatal nursing through excellence in practice, education, research, and professional development in 2014.

    "abstract": "PRENATAL REPAIR OF MYELOMENINGOCELE Open spina bifida is a congenital neural tube defect caused by primary failure of neural tube closure during the embryologic period. In myelomeningocele, the most severe form of spinal bifida, there is protrusion of the meninges and spinal cord through open vertebral arches. The consequences of myelomeningocele depend on the anatomical location of the defect, and include hindbrain herniation, hydrocephalus (with need for a ventriculoperitoneal shunt), paralysis and motor impairment, cognitive impairment, and bladder and bowel incontinence. Traditionally, when an infant is born with myelomeningocele, pediatric neurosurgeons perform surgical closure of the defect, and most infants will require a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, often followed by multiple shunt revisions. Many infants do not survive beyond 5 years of age. For 3 decades, teams of surgeons at the University of California San Francisco and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia have been working on the development of fetal surgical techniques that allow prenatal closure of myelomeningocele. They finally tested this technique in a randomized controlled trial, the Management of Myelomeningocele Study.1 Women were randomly assigned to undergo prenatal surgery before 26 weeks of gestation or standard postnatal repair. The trial was stopped early by the Data Safety Monitoring Board for efficacy of prenatal surgery. Infants who had surgery before birth had a 40% incidence of shunt placement compared with 82% of those who had postnatal surgery. Prenatal surgery was associated with improved mental and motor function scores at 30 months, improved ambulation, and less hindbrain herniation. However, prenatal surgery was associated with an increased risk for preterm delivery and uterine dehiscence. Prenatal surgery for myelomeningocele was recently highlighted in a PBS documentary titled “Twice Born.” 1. Adzick NS, Thom EA, Spong CY, et al. MOMS investigators. A randomized trial of prenatal versus postnatal repair of myelomeningocele. N Engl J Med. 2011;364:993–1004. RARE DISEASE DETECTIVES A little-known fact about rare diseases is that many individuals who suffer from the symptoms of a rare disease spend years bouncing from one specialist to another, and undergoing test after test before they get a definitive diagnosis. The average time to diagnosis for a rare disease is 7.2 years. Even more frustrating, however, is the situation faced by families of children who never receive a definitive diagnosis at all, and therefore, fail to receive appropriate treatment for their rare disease. In 2008, the National Human Genome Research Institute, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Rare Diseases Research, and the NIH Clinical Center launched the Undiagnosed Diseases Program (UDP) at the NIH's Bethesda, Maryland campus. The UDP was designed to leverage the NIH's expert staff and cutting-edge research tools to diagnose rare diseases in patients who have signs and symptoms that have eluded a definitive diagnosis. A second goal of the UDP is to advance knowledge of rare diseases and new presentations of common diseases. In its first 6 years, the UDP enrolled more than 800 undiagnosed children and adults in its clinical protocols. In addition to providing partial or complete diagnoses for up to 40% of those evaluated, the program's multidisciplinary team of experts has discovered 2 unknown diseases and identified 15 genes not previously known to be associated with any other human disease. However, the UDP has been able to accept only a fraction of the patients who apply to the program—more than 10,000 inquiries to date. The popularity of the UDP has demonstrated that a substantial unmet need exists for intensive evaluation of undiagnosed diseases among the population. Therefore, an extension of the program is underway that will add 6 new clinical sites at the Baylor College of Medicine; Harvard teaching hospitals (including Boston Children's Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Massachusetts General Hospital); Duke University; Stanford University; University of California, Los Angeles; and Vanderbilt University Medical Center. DRUG DEVELOPMENT FOR RARE DISEASES TAKES OFF The global pharmaceutical industry is pouring billions of dollars into developing drugs for rare diseases. This is very good news for the families of infants diagnosed with rare diseases because, traditionally, drug makers were reluctant to pursue treatments for rare diseases, leaving those affected by these diseases with no effective treatments at all. Most rare diseases cannot be cured, so the focus of research is on drugs and products that can alleviate the symptoms or slow the progression of the disease. Fortunately for patients and families, the industry is seeing a remarkable increase in the number of drugs for rare diseases reaching the market. Last year, the US Food and Drug Administration approved 17 new drugs for rare diseases, and hundreds more are in development. This increase has been largely fueled by legislation that makes it easier and more profitable for manufacturers to develop drugs for rare diseases. These incentives have reduced the cost of development, which, along with the high price tags on these drugs has allowed drug companies to realize profits from rare disease drugs even though the number of patients taking them is relatively small. A CHILD WITH ONDINE'S CURSE AND AN OSCAR-NOMINATED FILM You really must watch this 30-minute film, Our Curse, (http://www.nytimes.com/video/opinion/100000003489430/our-curse.htm). It is the story of a young Polish couple whose first child, Leo, was born with a rare disease called Ondine's Curse (congenital central hypoventilation syndrome). Every night when he goes to sleep, Leo must be put on a ventilator to prevent potentially fatal episodes of hypoventilation during sleep. The film covers the period of time from when Leo first comes home from the hospital, and how his parents cope with the possibility that Leo will require a ventilator throughout his life. Leo is adorable, and his parents are both courageous and terrified, as well as brutally honest about their feelings and their fears about Leo's future. The film was nominated for an Oscar. Congenital central hypoventilation disorder (CCHD) is a rare neurorespiratory disorder caused by a mutation of the PHOX2B gene.1 Depending on the mutation, a range of severity in the phenotype for CCHD is possible. In the most severe form, the affected individual requires continuous mechanical ventilation. Individuals with CCHD rarely live beyond the age of 30 years. 1.

    "abstract": "REFLECTIONS OF A PAST NANN AWARD RECIPIENTCarol WallmanA perennial highlight of the NANN Annual Educational Conference is the awards given to the many amazing nurses and nurse practitioners who exemplify NANN's mission to shape neonatal nursing through excellence in practice, education, research, and professional development. The 2015 NANN and NANNP Awards Program will recognize nominees in Leadership, the Navigator Award, the Robyn Main Excellence in Clinical Practice Award, the Neonatal Nurse Practitioner Excellence Award, Distinguished Service Award, Lifetime Achievement Award, Research Abstract, Clinical Abstract, and Small Grant Awards, as well as the Chapter of the Year and Individual Chapter Project Awards. The winners of these awards will be in the company of outstanding professionals who preceded them. Carol Wallman, DNP, MS, NNP, winner of the 2006 NANN Distinguished Service Award and the 2013 NANN Clinical Abstract Award, as well as the 2014 NANN Research Abstract Award, is among these outstanding professionals. When asked about the impact of these awards—specifically, the Research and Clinical Abstract Awards—on her professionally, Carol shared “completing a research project had always seemed overwhelming and elusive to me. Through the completion of my project and subsequent award I gained the needed confidence to pursue other research opportunities.” Always a supporter of NANN products and programs, it was fitting that Carol's research supported the National Association of Neonatal Nurse Practitioner's (NANNP) Competencies and Orientation Toolkit for NNPs recommendation for ongoing procedural review and evaluation. The research, Carol stated, “supported the effectiveness of online review when compared with textbook review. This is helpful information as we as a society and a profession transition to an increased amount of online education for both continuing education and university programs.” Reflecting on how NANN and NANNP have supported her career, research, and educational goals, Carol shares a summary of her journey: NANN was a huge support to me in my early career as a staff nurse, particularly the journal and educational conferences. As I advanced in my career I began to volunteer for various committees and task forces for NANN. This led to my appointment as the liaison to the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Fetus and Newborn (AAP/COFN) and subsequently serving the membership through a position on the NANN Board of Directors for 4 years. As the liaison to the AAP/COFN I had the opportunity to be part of the team responsible for defining and publishing guidelines for the late preterm infant. This has had a huge impact on neonatal care across the nation and internationally. It has been a huge honor to play a role in this work and watch the developing body of evidence to provide the best care to this unique population. As NANNP developed and grew they helped support me in my professional role as a neonatal nurse practitioner (NNP) educator by providing helpful tools and resources such as the Competencies and Orientation Toolkit for NNPs. We used this as a guide for developing our new graduate NNP residency program at my place of employment. I also used this as a resource and inspiration for my doctorate of nursing practice capstone project for which I received the 2014 Research Abstract Award. Throughout my career, NANN and NANNP have served as wonderful resources for current practice issues and guidelines, but even more than that it has provided me with inspirational role models, friends, and colleagues. NANN and NANNP have been integral to my ongoing passion for my career! Recognizing the achievements of members such as Dr Carol Wallman is one of the many ways NANN and NANNP live their mission. Please join us at the NANN 31st Annual Educational Conference in Dallas, Texas, October 22 to 25, 2015, as we welcome the newly awarded NANN members to this esteemed group of previous winners.

    "abstract": "VOLUNTEERING: NANN MEMBER SHARES HER SKILL AT HOME AND ABROAD “I wanted to be a nurse for as long as I can remember” is what longtime NANN and NANNP member Tracy Heaberlin, MSN, RN, NNP, recalls. A graduate of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in 1985, Tracy always dreamed of working with children. After graduation, Tracy was given the opportunity to work with babies and families and never looked back. Tracy has had a variety of experiences in her career. Since obtaining a master's degree and neonatal nurse practitioner (NNP) certification from the University of Colorado followed by a master's degree in business administration from Colorado State University, she has worked in level II to level IV neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) from Alaska to the rural mountain town of Steamboat Springs, Colorado. Tracy now works as a NNP for Children's Hospital Colorado, practicing in a level III NICU in Fort Collins, Colorado. Volunteerism has played an important role in Tracy's career. Addressing volunteerism and what excites her, Tracy says “I love that I have had so many opportunities to support perinatal care in so many ways.” A long-time advocate for family-centered care, Tracy became involved in the Colorado Perinatal Care Council (CPCC) while developing a low-volume, high-acuity special care nursery in Steamboat Springs, Colorado. The CPCC works to enhance the delivery of perinatal care services throughout the state of Colorado and welcomes input from families and healthcare providers. Tracy became a hospital representative to the council in 1998. After 13 years of involvement on the council, Tracy was appointed to the council's Executive Committee. “The CPCC's current project is creating a state collaborative for quality measures focused on implementing evidence-based medicine and striving for greater transparency among institutions,” Tracy says. “It is hoped that this project will improve Colorado's delivery of care in all regions of the state. Volunteering on the council has been a great professional and educational experience, exposing Tracy to other states' successes and her state's health policies. Her hope is that her work on the council serves to “engage those I work with in broadening their ideas of safe care while implementing evidence-based care and facilitating a shift in care models that both improve the family experience and decrease the overall cost of care.” While in search of an international volunteering opportunity centered on children and families, Tracy learned of the concept of volunteer vacations and the organization, Global Volunteers. The vision and mission of Global Volunteers resonated with her. She explains that Global Volunteers “engages short-term volunteers on long-term projects to create, nurture, and sustain the well-being of the world's children so they can realize the full promise of their human potential.” Tracy's first volunteer experience was caring for babies in an orphanage in Romania. Her most recent trips have been to St Lucia. Tracy works with mothers and their children aged 0 to 3 years in their homes to provide education, developmental stimulation, and support through a program called the St Lucia Project. Tracy explains Global Volunteers definition of the St Lucia Project: The St Lucia Project plans to demonstrate that local people, with the assistance of short-term volunteers, can ensure that every young child receives the developmental assistance they need to thrive. Over 30% of the island's people live in poverty. Recent global research shows that insufficient nutrition and persistent parasitic and diarrheal disease in developing countries like St Lucia adversely impact children's brain development, especially in the earliest years. Generations are affected, resulting in entire populations who struggle to develop their human potential. Global Volunteers works with community leaders in Anse la Raye, on the western coast of the island, to help deliver the 12 essential services to local families. Tracy learned from her time in St Lucia that “babies are the same everywhere.” Their potential is limited by their health, nutrition, and stimulation. “I enjoy experiencing other cultures and knowing that in a short time my love, kindness, and support can make a difference in each life I touch.” Summing up her experiences nd what they have taught her, Tracy reflects “my experiences in volunteering with families whose challenges seem insurmountable has helped me realize the power of love and an open heart.” Having a career that constantly presents professional challenges coupled with volunteering at home and abroad, Tracy takes away a simple insight. “A helping hand, a warm smile, and a meaningful hug have amazing healing powers,” she says. New Publications for the NNP NANNP strives to improve care for neonates, infants, and their families by providing a forum for NNPs and advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) on clinical and professional issues, education, advocacy, and research. NANN and NANNP give NNPs and APRNs a voice by publishing guidelines, white papers, and position statements on timely and important topics in the neonatal nursing field. NANNP recently released 3 publications on educational standards, NNP scope of practice, and the future of APRNs. The publications are free and available at http://www.nannp.org/publications. NNP Education Standards Professional accountability begins with ensuring the quality of educational preparation of nurse practitioners. Organizations within the broader category of advanced practice nursing are responsible for defining more specific standards of education for their own members. Thus, NANN and NANNP define the standards of education for the NNP. NANNP's Education Standards and Guidelines for NNP Programs discusses 6 minimum standards necessary for preparation of NNPs: NNP educational program, faculty and faculty organization, program leadership, curriculum, preceptors, and clinical sites. Each program standard includes background information and rationale for each standard. These standards are intended for use in conjunction with other accreditation or review tools for NNPs.FigureThe Future of APRN Practice Recently, NANN and NANNP have been monitoring aspects of neonatal advanced practice nursing and providing leadership and advocacy to address concerns related to workforce, education, competency, fatigue, safety, and scope of practice. The Future of Neonatal Advanced Practice Registered Nurse Practice (white paper) discusses current barriers within neonatal APRN practice as well as strategies to promote the longevity of the neonatal APRN. The Role of APRNs In previous years, NANN and NANNP have developed several policy statements on neonatal APRN workforce, education, competency, fatigue, safety, and scope of practice. The Advanced Practice Registered Nurse: Role, Preparation, and Scope of Practice position statement is a synthesis of previous efforts and discusses the role, preparation, and scope of practice and the neonatal APRN.

    "abstract": "Ewing sarcoma (EWS) is an aggressive soft-tissue and bone malignancy. Congenital EWS is extremely rare, and its presenting features can be unique from that of EWS occurring in older children.A full-term female infant with a neck mass present at birth was admitted to a level I nursery with an otherwise well appearance and normal vital signs. After consultation with a neonatologist, she was transferred to a neonatal intensive care unit where she developed sudden respiratory collapse from rapid growth of the mass causing airway obstruction, leading to emergent intubation. Ultrasound and MRI scans of the neck mass demonstrated cystic and vascular components, and a timely biopsy revealed small round blue cells with diffuse CD99 expression and chromosomal translocation 11;22.Ewing sarcoma.An accelerated workup for EWS was done due to the patient's critical status. On day of life (DOL) 8, she was started on treatment of EWS as per the current standard-of-care AEWS0031. On DOL 24, she underwent tracheostomy placement.The patient completed 14 total cycles of chemotherapy and is more than 12 months old. Her tracheostomy was decannulated at 6 months of age.The rarity of EWS in neonates and its presentation as a neck mass make this disease difficult to recognize unless clinicians have a high index of suspicion. The aims of this case report are to increase awareness of malignancy as a potential cause of neck masses in neonates and to prompt nurses and physicians to prepare for airway stabilization at appropriate levels of care if a neck mass is present at birth.",

    "abstract": "We celebrate the beginning of 2021 with the faith that our passion for excellence in provision of neonatal care will prevail in the hard work ahead. As with other age groups, infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) experience health disparities secondary to racism and inequalities.1–3 While this fact has been clear for years, recognition of how nurses and other neonatal healthcare providers contribute to health inequity and how we all have the responsibility to address health inequities has only recently come to the forefront. In this editorial, we are asking that everyone speak up against and take necessary steps to ameliorate the impact of inequity and racism in the NICU environment. Taking this stand may be uncomfortable for those of us who are privileged by the existence of racism, but it should not hinder the needed progress to support our infants, families, and colleagues. Infant mortality is a key indicator of health in the United States and worldwide. Non-Hispanic Black infants die at more than twice the rate (10.8 per 1000 live births) of non-Hispanic White infants (4.6 per 1000 live births).4 While social determinates of health (discrimination, community deprivation, poor access to healthcare, limited educational, and economic opportunity) are leading contributors to health disparities in infants cared for in NICUs, they do not tell the entire story.1–3,5 Conventional risk factors (social determinates of health) place Black women and infants at a higher risk than their non-Hispanic White counterparts while conventional protective factors (high socioeconomic status and high education) are not as protective as they might be for other groups.5 Racial disparities in infant mortality and morbidity are often attributed to maternal engagement in “risky” behaviors (eg, drug abuse) or maternal comorbidities (obesity); yet, health disparities persist even after these factors are considered or amilerated.5 The biological and psychological stress of racism can explain this finding. Given the impact of racism on the outcomes for our infants and families, we offer 3 resources to begin our journey to address NICU health disparities. First, NANN developed a position statement that provides 9 practical interventions that all NICUs can implement to address racial disparities: Elevate awareness by encouraging open discussion; Encourage diversity in the workforce; Examine personal bias and beliefs; Be open to feedback; Examine your NICU stats to determine significant trends; Create diverse teams of parent committees that contribute to NICU culture; Use qualified interpreters when caring for families that do not speak English; Provide information in multiple languages whenever possible; Consider discharge requirements and available resources for a successful transition home; and Be an advocate for racial awareness and equality in your hospital and community. We hope you will consider these recommendations and initiate the conversation in your units. See http://nann.org/uploads/About/PositionPDFS/Racial_Dispariy_in_the_NICU_-_FINAL_6.12.20.pdf for the entire position statement. Additional education resources can be located at http://nann.org/education/health-equity-and-cultural-competency. At NANN's annual conference in October 2020, Dr Jenné Johns, a national health equity thought leader, discussed her experience as the mother of a micropreemie in the NICU. Her experience challenges us to consider the role we should play in eliminating health disparities. Dr Johns' recommendations provide a path for delivery of high-quality and equitable care to all families, regardless of race, language, or socioeconomic status. Dr Johns' presentation would provide you a peek inside the world of what it is like to have a Black infant in the NICU, and we believe it will inspire you to be a better version of yourself. You can locate Dr Johns' conference presentation www.nann.org/equity for access to the session. This presentation is freely available to all through this link even if you did not register or attend the conference. Please share widely; this message is important to delivery of excellent care. In this issue of Advances in Neonatal Care for 2021, we continue this discussion with an article, titled “Becoming an Anti-racist Neonatal Community.” We hope you will take the time to carefully read this work and commit yourself to opening up and learning about the history of how we got to this point in neonatal care and what we can do as a neonatal community to move forward. Remaining in place is not an option if we are to provide the best neonatal care possible to all of our infants. However, moving forward will require hard work from everyone.

    "abstract": "Background: Neonatal mortality (death within 0-28 d of life) in Kenya is high despite strong evidence that newborn care recommendations save lives. In public healthcare facilities, nurses counsel caregivers on term newborn care, but knowledge about the content and quality of nurses' recommendations is limited. Purpose: To describe the term newborn care recommendations provided at a tertiary-level, public referral hospital in Western Kenya, how they were provided, and related content taught at a university nursing school. Methods: A rapid, focused ethnographic assessment, guided by the culture care theory, using stratified purposive sampling yielded 240 hours of participant observation, 24 interviews, 34 relevant documents, and 268 pages of field notes. Data were organized using NVivo software and key findings identified using applied thematic analysis. Results: Themes reflect recommendations for exclusive breastfeeding, warmth, cord care, follow-up examinations, and immunizations, which were provided orally in Kiswahili and some on a written English discharge summary. Select danger sign recommendations were also provided orally, if needed. Some recommendations conflicted with other providers' guidance. More recommendations for maternal care were provided than for newborn care. Implications for Practice: There is need for improved consistency in content and provision of recommendations before discharge. Findings should be used to inform teaching, clinical, and administrative processes to address practice competency and improve nursing care quality. Implications for Research: Larger studies are needed to determine whether evidence-based recommendations are provided consistently across facilities and other populations, such as community-born and premature newborns, who also experience high rates of neonatal mortality in Kenya.",

Typically arising from one or more ribs, this tumor will have a rapid growth between weeks 28 and 36 of gestation, followed by a plateau and a spontaneous regression, usually within the first year of life.A 37-week 2-day, 3.48-kg female infant was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit with a prenatally diagnosed left chest mass with a large pleural effusion and respiratory failure.The infant was referred to our institution with multiple chest masses on the left side, resulting in the thorax's marked deformity. Imaging studies confirmed the presence of a multifocal mesenchymal hamartoma.At laparotomy, 3 mesenchymal hamartomas were found. The lateral mass, encompassing ribs 5 and 6, resulted in an en bloc resection. The ribs cephalad and caudal were bowed and displaced but not involved in the mesenchymal hamartoma. Complete excision of the lateral mass was done, and histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of mesenchymal hamartoma.After resection of the largest mass, the left lung reinflated appropriately, and within a few weeks, the infant was discharged home without supplemental oxygen support.Symptomatic patients with cardiorespiratory compromise are best treated with surgical resection. In asymptomatic patients, it is best to proceed with serial imaging and conservative management with watchful waiting. Due to the rarity of the condition, data on long-term follow-up and outcomes are needed.",

Based on this data, we hypothesized that women with maternal diabetes were more likely to have infants who developed neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). Purpose: The purpose of the study was to examine the association between maternal diabetes and NAS in a cohort of women reporting substance use during pregnancy. Methods: This study used data from a population-based cohort of all newborns born in 2017 and 2018 (N = 36,974) in the state of West Virginia and restricted the analysis to those infants with intrauterine substance exposure (14%, n = 5188). Multiple logistic regression was performed to analyze the adjusted relationship between maternal diabetes and NAS while controlling for maternal and infant covariates. Results: Just over 28% of women with diabetes had an infant who developed NAS, whereas 34.8% of women without diabetes had an infant who developed NAS. The adjusted odds ratio of infants developing NAS born to women with diabetes was 0.70 (95% confidence interval: 0.51, 0.94) compared with those born to mothers without diabetes after controlling for covariates. Contrary to our hypothesis, the study suggests that maternal diabetes during pregnancy is associated with a decreased risk of an infant developing NAS. Implications for Practice: Future research generating from this hypothesis may lead to potential implications for practice for infants born to mothers with substance use during pregnancy and diabetes. Implications for Research: More research should be conducted to investigate the relationship between glucose metabolism and NAS.",

    "abstract": "Despite significant advances in technology and healthcare, racial and ethnic inequities in infant health persist in the United States. This editorial highlights critically needed steps to advance neonatal research to eliminate existing disparities. Black women are more likely to have a premature birth than all other women in this country.1 Compared with White mothers, low-socioeconomic Black and Hispanic women are more likely to have limited access to maternity care and give birth in hospitals with a higher risk for neonatal morbidity and mortality.2 Premature or very low birth-weight Black and Hispanic infants have a 2- to 4-fold increased risk of developing more severe neonatal morbidities,3 and Black infants die at more than twice the rate of White infants.1 To address these somber statistics, neonatal researchers and clinicians face several challenges. First, they must recognize opportunities within research activities that have the potential to inform targeted interventions and best practices to overcome inequities in maternal child health. In the field of neonatal research, inclusion of race and ethnicity as variables to describe the population upon which the research is conducted is a common practice and appropriate. Description of racial and ethnic characteristics allows for identification of populations at more or less risk and population-specific patterns.4 However, measurements of these demographic variables need to contribute to our understanding of the etiology of health disparities and guide development of targeted interventions.4 For several years, the National Institutes of Health has required that large studies make data available to outside investigators.5 Additional sources of “Big Data” are also available by other private and public agencies of the health sector. These are excellent resources for neonatal researchers with limited funding or resources. Health disparity experts concur on the necessity to move from description of risk factors and disparities to understand the root causes of the disparity, which are foundational to the development of targeted interventions that will ultimately lead to decreased inequities.4,6,7 Nonetheless, clear guidelines are missing on how to move forward and reach this important milestone in disparities research. Some opportunities exist to facilitate understanding of how ethnic and cultural characteristics are associated with health inequities. Examples include optimizing use of evidence from large- and small-scale studies where ethnic and racial variables are clearly described and measured (not just grouping all minorities together under “other ethnic groups”). These studies usually provide rich data for our increased understanding of risk factors and disparities common among certain groups, in specific geographical areas, and the association of these predictors with adverse health outcomes unique to the studied population.7 Utilizing large data sets with clearly defined ethnic and racial descriptors can contribute to better estimation of causes for disparities by using available and sophisticated statistical modeling techniques.6,7 Much of the research in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) has not focused on culturally sensitive practices; for the most part, neonatal research has focused on response to disease or age-appropriate care of the preterm infant. Development of ethnic and culturally sensitive interventions remains a challenge because of persistent underrepresentation of historically disadvantaged populations in clinical and intervention research. Implementation scientists have proposed using a “scaling out” methodology or tailoring approach that allows for adaptation of original evidence-based interventions to new populations.6 For example, this might include a study addressing adaptation of a mother's own milk expression intervention to be more culturally relevant for the low-income NICU mother of color. Furthermore, existing data can elucidate the likely impact of specific interventions and evidence-based strategies that can ultimately reduce health disparities. Scaling out methodology facilitates more rapid implementation of culturally appropriate evidence-based interventions that were not originally developed and tested equitable across all racial and ethnic groups.4,6 For example, a recently published evidence-based brief suggests that available lactation support practices for Hispanic and Black mothers of premature infants are based on practices developed and evaluated primarily among White mothers.8 Consequently, more thoughtful and systematic approaches are thus needed to improve research disparities and child health.4,8 Moving forward, neonatal researchers and clinicians have an obligation to leverage prospective and retrospective data from existing studies to go beyond description of demographic characteristics and work effectively toward development and implementation of interventions targeted for effectiveness among minority families.4 To attain this goal, there are some strategies worth exploring to help us eliminate health inequities among neonates. One initial strategy could be to utilize findings from studies with subanalyses by appropriately defined minority groups to inform development of focused interventions in studies of “exclusive” minorities.6 These interventions should target cultural and ethnic differences unique to the socioeconomic and geographical needs of the studied group. Another strategy is making efficient use of existing data to examine differences across racial and ethnic groups and develop interventions that allow for adaptation of evidence-based interventions within their cultural needs and characteristics while avoiding the tendency to assume that “one size fits all.”6,7 The last strategy focuses on collaborating with our colleagues to layer evidence from multiple sources, not only to shed light into new research questions but also to reveal potential interventions.4,6,7 This is an important strategy, as neonatal researchers should work collectively if we wish to make an impact on the health of our minority neonates. Through collective and intentional work, development of interventions can consider the complex societal and cultural forces influencing the daily experiences of minority groups and optimize expertise of researchers in our field.4,7 Furthermore, scientists in the neonatal arena should be cognizant of the pervasive effects of racism on quality of neonatal care and disparities and work to develop interventions aimed at eliminating organizational and clinical processes that support racism.2 Neonatal researchers and clinicians should embrace this opportunity to eliminate inequities in research and ultimately reach health equity for all children.4 Future research must assess the impact of previously identified risk and protective factors and leverage available data to promote effective multilevel prevention strategies that are culturally and ethnic driven to achieve optimal maternal and child outcomes.4,6,7 Diana C.

    "abstract": "Background: Olmsted syndrome is a rare and complex skin disorder affecting 46 (published) infants as of 2012. The infants affected in this case were born premature at 28 weeks' gestation. Infants affected by this syndrome demonstrate numerous plaques on several specific areas of the skin. Common treatments include exfoliation in addition to psoriasis treatments. The extremely fragile nature of the premature infants' skin complicates treatment modalities. Clinical Findings: The progression of the infants' dermatologic findings and plaque formation is discussed in this case study. Primary Diagnosis: The primary diagnosis of Olmsted syndrome was made with the assistance of a multidisciplinary team to work through several differential diagnoses presenting with severe forms of palmoplantar keratoderma. Interventions: The management of skin plaques in twin premature infants is presented in this case study. An evidence-based approach, utilizing the model of family-centered care, is presented with multidisciplinary involvement and an outline of the specific plan of care for the extensive skin care regimen used. Outcomes: An interdisciplinary skin care regimen was created to provide consistency in transition from hospital to home. Using a consistent approach, the plaques were able to be softened and many removed. Continual maintenance is required to manage continual buildup of skin plaques. Practice Recommendations: Premature infants are at increased risk for infection due to the immaturity of their skin. The complexity of their skin complicates the ability to recognize and care for rare skin disorders. This case study illuminates the practicality of a consistent and evidence-based approach to a complex and rare skin disorder.",

Routine initial pharmacologic management when a neonate presents with signs of sepsis in the first weeks of life typically targets antibiotic therapies. This case illustrates the importance of the addition of antiviral coverage, especially when a neonate demonstrates temperature instability and neurologic changes.This case report describes the unique presentation of a 9-day old neonate with clinical findings significant for sepsis. This neonate was diagnosed with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia with concomitant disseminated HSV-2 infection after presenting with temperature instability, lethargy, and signs of multisystem organ impairment.This neonate was diagnosed with disseminated HSV infection, which occurs in 25% of neonatal HSV disease.Treatment was initiated with high-dose intravenous acyclovir at 20 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours along with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Management should include anticipating and monitoring for progressive multisystem organ failure in bacterial or viral infection.This patient did not survive despite maximal intervention from the neonatal intensive care unit team. Disseminated HSV neonatal infections are associated with high mortality rates when they are present alone, and mortality is higher with concurrent bacteremia.Providers should have a high index of suspicion for HSV infection in neonates presenting in the first 1 to 3 weeks of life with signs of sepsis. Prophylactic treatment with high-dose acyclovir as an adjunct to broad-spectrum antibiotics while awaiting laboratory confirmation can be lifesaving.",

Preintervention data were collected as a baseline prior to the quality improvement (QI) initiative and revealed that 87% of eligible infants were in unsafe sleep environments (n = 331/379). This data revealed the need for an improvement project to help increase the percentage of infants placed in safe sleep in this NICU.The purpose of this QI initiative was to increase the percentage of eligible infants being placed in safe sleep environments by registered nurses in a NICU.The development of an evidence-based safe sleep bundle was implemented in a level IV NICU at an academic medical center in the Southeastern United States. Data were subsequently collected for 5 months via bi weekly crib audits.Of the 744 infants audited in the QI period, 604 were observed in a safe sleep environment. From the pre- to postintervention period, SSPs increased by 68% (preintervention: 13%, postintervention: 81%, P value < .001). Adherence to the varying components of SSPs also reflected statistically significant improvements.SSPs should be endorsed and modeled in all NICUs. Introducing proper SSPs in the hospital setting may lead to better compliance at home by the infants' caregivers.",

Cronbach's α, linear regression, and Spearman's correlation were used for data analysis.Analysis of the 72 participating NICU nurses' survey responses showed fewer patients per nurse during the shift was negatively correlated with stress related to Death and Dying ( P < .001) and Uncertainty Concerning Treatment ( P = .002) subscale scores. This inverse relationship remained significant after controlling for education and years of experience.The observed higher stress can be inferred to be due to high patient acuity since fewer patients are assigned to nurses caring for high-acuity patients. Improvements in communication to nurses about patients' medical condition, treatment rationale, and information that should be conveyed to the family could reduce nurse stress from treatment uncertainty. Targeted education and counseling could help nurses cope with stress due to patient deaths.Interventions to reduce stress related to treatment uncertainty and death of patients among NICU nurses caring for high-acuity infants should be developed and evaluated.",

    "abstract": "In 2019, 9.3% of all newborns, or 349,290 infants, were admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).1 While tremendous advances have been made in the resuscitation and initial care of infants born with critical illnesses, some will unfortunately die from complications related to their condition (in 2018, the mortality rate was 5.6 per 1000),2 while others will go on to develop complex chronic health conditions that require ongoing intensive therapies and extended hospital stays. Caring for infants and their families during this time can be very challenging work, and neonatal nurses can often find themselves in situations where the potential development of ethical dilemmas and moral distress exists. These situations are common in the NICU, and there are several reasons why they occur.3 The NICU is stressful by nature where the vulnerability of patients and decision making by proxy intersect in a place where prognostication can be difficult and the many different perspectives of stakeholders (nurses, physicians, parents, family members, etc) regarding medical futility and course of treatment may create conflict amongst team members. Nurses may also experience moral distress in the face of balancing patient–parent autonomy against harm and suffering and/or may feel ill-prepared to care for infants and their families because of a lack of education, training, or experience. Finally, a sense of failure might be felt by the nurse if the infant dies, especially if the infant was a primary patient. Regular exposure to these situations and feelings that may cause moral distress can lead to burnout and compassion fatigue, especially if nurses are not supported to process their feelings, promote their own self-care, and develop strategies for resiliency. In 2016, the Critical Care Societies Collaborative (CCSC) published a call to action to bring awareness to the problem of burnout syndrome that has been increasing among those employed in high-stress positions, including all types of healthcare professionals.4 Unfortunately, critical care healthcare professionals have one of the highest rates of burnout syndrome, which can adversely affect the ability to properly care for patients and families over time. These authors urged the development of interventions to mitigate the effects of burnout syndrome, and professional societies were called out as a key stakeholder that could educate and inform their members of risks of burnout syndrome and compassion fatigue.4 Furthermore, the National Association of Neonatal Nurses (NANN) position statement #3067 NICU Nurse Involvement in Ethical Decisions (Treatment of Critically Ill Newborns),5 originally published in May 2016 and reaffirmed in June 2021, states that “the process of making ethical decisions in the NICU should incorporate family desires, infant conditions, and the ability of the healthcare team to provide meaningful care” and advocates for NICU nurses to be part of the multidisciplinary team that makes these types of decisions.5 NANN also recommends “education for nurses in the theory and practice of ethics in healthcare, conflict resolution, and bereavement support training.”5 Having the ability to recognize and then address any ethical issues that are encountered is an essential skill for nurses to embrace as it will enable them to advocate for and provide safe and ethical care for their patients, while also protecting themselves from burnout and compassion fatigue.6 Nurses can improve their knowledge and overall understanding of ethics and increase their resiliency by seeking out opportunities to learn and grow from the challenging clinical situations that they face.6 This is an area of critical attention to promote the health and well-being of neonatal nurses while acknowledging the infants and families we care for. I believe that Advances in Neonatal Care can provide the perfect forum for the presentation of articles to inform and educate neonatal nurses, along with other healthcare professionals, how to identify and manage ethical issues and dilemmas in the NICU that have the potential to lead to burnout and compassion fatigue. Nurse authors can share their experiences, and those who seek information may earn and grow from their processes and outcomes. Articles may be research-based, opinion pieces, or debates about choosing a course of action. Dilemmas may be related to challenges in the care of the mother and the fetus or the infant. Controversies in social impact of maternal behavior on the pregnancy are included. Nurses' feelings about provision of care to neonates who are very young, sick, or genetically impaired may be reported. Reports on special programs to provide palliative, hospice, and/or end-of-life care to newborns would also be of great interest. Creating continuing education opportunities from submitted articles might also be possible. If you have experienced a challenging ethical dilemma that you think might make for an interesting case study or opinion piece to share with your neonatal colleagues, or if you have original research, evidence-based practice project, literature review, or other type of project, I hope you might consider submitting your work for the Ethical Issues in Neonatal Care section. If you have any questions regarding a potential submission, please contact me at [email protected] to discuss. Christine A. Fortney, PhD, RN Section Editor, Ethical Issues in Neonatal Care",

Eighteen infants with a birth weight of 1250 g or less and gestational age of 32 weeks or less born between June and October 2010 were compared with 15 historical controls of the same birth weight and gestation born between January and May 2010 using a prospective cohort design. The prospective group followed a newly implemented standardized protein nutritional guideline. Independent t-tests and repeated measures of analyses of variance (between- and within-subjects) were performed on the difference between the intended and actual protein intakes between the 2 groups. A multivariate analysis of variance computed the difference between the birth and discharge gains. The prospective group showed statistically significant differences between the amount of intended and actual protein intakes (P = .023) when compared with historical controls. Growth outcomes were not significantly different (P = .67) between the 2 groups. Length of stay was not statistically significantly shorter (P = .06) in the prospective group. Reduction in clinical practice variation was associated with the implementation of a protein nutritional guideline. There was no statistical support for an improvement in the growth outcomes or reduction in length of stay.",

The steering committee for the program included 5 staff members (a physician, a NICU nurse, a parent education nurse, a lactation consultant, and a social worker) and the parent volunteers. This article includes a total of 42 mothers of infants born at 35-week gestation or less were enrolled in the pilot program. A detailed description and qualitative evaluation of the engagement of veteran parents in the design and implementation of the family-integrated care program. The effectiveness of engaging veteran parents in developing this model of care was evaluated by written feedback from the veteran parents and the other steering committee members. In addition, a structured interview at discharge with the 42 mothers enrolled in the pilot study was used to assess their experiences of the peer-to-peer support provided by veteran parents. Veteran NICU parents brought a wealth of wisdom and expertise developed through personal experience to the design and implementation of the family-integrated care program. The veteran parents played a significant role in both the initial development of the program and in the provision of peer-to-peer support during program implementation. Engagement of parents with prior experience of the NICU care environment is a critical step in the design and implementation of a program of family-integrated care.",

A neonatal nurse practitioner (NNP) program was developed by Tehran Medical University with cooperation of Iran's Neonatologist Association. The first group of master's students started their formal education in September 2009 with the principal goal of becoming \"clinical nurse practitioners\" ready to work in the neonatal intensive care unit as \"first responders.\" Neonatal nurse practitioners are an integral and important aspect of the interdisciplinary team. Although it is a newly practiced role in Iran, it has been well accepted by those in the clinical and academic field. Comparing Iran's admission criteria with other well-experienced countries through the world will better help the development of this new specialty.",

    "abstract": "Mentors guide your steps to paths you never knew existed. “There's someone I'd like you to meet.” That's how my mentoring relationship began, how a globally respected expert's path collided with that of a Florida neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) nurse. Dr Janet Pettit was a neonatal nurse practitioner, a clinical nurse specialist, an educator extraordinaire, and I'm proud to say, my mentor. She encouraged, inspired, and motivated me to walk paths of professional growth that I never knew existed or dreamed were possible. She advised what my first article should be about and why it was needed. She was a kind editor in my first attempt at publication. She was always thinking about what the next step should be to explore and advance practices. Our shared passion for best practice for peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) would lead to unique collaborations and our first national survey. Thanks to Dr Pettit, I came to know the joy of publication including an article in this issue of Advances in Neonatal Care. Dr Pettit was a pioneer with her early recognition that vascular access was a critical and essential bridge on the road from the NICU to home. Throughout her more than 35-year career in nursing, she pursued and modeled excellence in care, research, and anything else in her sights. She was a nationally and internationally recognized leader and educator, whose numerous accomplishments include landmark publications such as the National Association of Neonatal Nurses (NANN) Guideline for Practice: Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters, 1st and 2nd editions, and the Association for Vascular Access Pediatric Central Venous Catheter Best Practice Guidelines. Dr Pettit was a visionary advocate for the development of new evidence and advancement of the science in our field. Although her expertise was impressive, what set Dr Pettit apart was not only her professionalism but also her heart. Her compassion and humility enabled her to connect with clinicians, yet challenge and inspire them to stretch just a bit farther to elevate neonatal practice. She always was willing to share her knowledge and expertise. Dr Janet Pettit led early quality improvement initiatives as a founding member of the California Perinatal Quality Care Collaborative, producing the first toolkit for central line–associated bloodstream infection and significant positive outcomes nationwide. She also served on the NANN Board of Directors and was awarded the Lifetime Achievement award. Her unwavering commitment to advancing the science of vascular access earned her the Herbst award from the Association for Vascular Access. She was the founder of the Vascular Access Certification Corporation providing certification in the specialty of vascular access. A true mentor wields great power and can be life-changing. Dr Pettit knew just when and how to encourage, the art of gentle reminders, and always shared the disappointments and the joys of accomplishments. She not only taught more than the nuts and bolts of professional growth but also how to have fun along the way. At one meeting, she convinced me that it was more important to see the National Cathedral than to attend every talk. In hindsight, this visit was priceless. Her passion for excellence was contagious, raised the bar for those around her, and continues to impact care for countless infants and families globally. Leadership is about making others better as a result of your presence and making sure that impact lasts in your absence. (Sheryl Sandberg) I am grateful for my colleagues with whom I have enjoyed the privilege of collaboration in our most recent survey on neonatal PICCs appearing in this issue. Dr Janet Pettit was an extraordinary mentor and a remarkable leader. Through her work to advance the science, clinicians worldwide are empowered to sustain her impact, reduce patient harm, and enable brighter futures for the tiniest of our patients every day. She left our neonatal community too soon and her gifts are missed, but the legacy of her leadership is lasting.

    "abstract": "With the significant increase in the number of journals as well as author submissions worldwide, peer review is more important than ever. While at the same time, the burden of peer review is also worrisome since reviewers often review for several journals increasing the chances for multiple simultaneous review requests. Yet, without rigorous peer review, clinicians, educators, students, and researchers may be misled by inaccurate information.1 In this editorial we want to share some changes to our peer review process that we believe will facilitate thoughtful review. As editors, we depend upon strong peer review because just like you we do not have expertise in all subject areas. Similar to most journals we solicit a minimum of 3 peer reviews for each manuscript; however, we often have to invite twice that many individuals to achieve 3 completed reviews. Reviewers decline to review for a variety of reasons including competing priorities during the time frame requested for the review, illness, or lack of expertise in the content of the manuscript. However, it is important to note that we do not select reviewers solely on their expertise in the topical area of the manuscript. First, we may select a reviewer because of the role they play in neonatal care (eg, bedside nurse, advanced practice nurse, educator, and researcher). As a staff nurse you may not have the expertise to evaluate the validity of the research methods used in a study, but you would likely know the potential barriers to implementation of the clinical recommendations from a study. Your thoughts around the acceptability or feasibility of the findings would stimulate the researcher to address an important aspect of the work. As a staff nurse you also provide a perspective that is representative of the majority of the readership of Advances in Neonatal Care (ANC), and as such this perspective is important to our review process. Other reviewers decline a review because they do not have the expertise to evaluate the complex methods or statistics used in a quality improvement project. Do not be concerned if you lack expertise in one area of any manuscript whether it be a clinical practice issue, a case study, or a databased paper. As Co-Editors in Chief we also select reviewers for their collective contribution to the review (expertise in the topical area, research methodology, and statistical expertise). Most reviewers can identify at least one area of a manuscript that they cannot fully evaluate, but that does not mean that they cannot make a meaningful contribution to the review. Recently, I was asked to review a manuscript evaluating the relationship between sleep and developmental outcome in infants. Having expertise in research in both sleep and high-risk infant developmental outcomes, I felt confident that I could make a meaningful contribution to the review. However, this infant study was completed with rats and I have no expertise in bench research with animal models. Therefore, I gave the editor my thoughtful review and acknowledged that I was unable to assess whether the methods used to assess development in the rats was appropriate. By acknowledging this limitation, I also provided the editor with information about whether this manuscript would be comprehensible to the audience in question. This is important information that provides the editor direction about potential revisions. Consequently, if you are asked to review an article, assume that if you use the ANC reviewer guidelines, you will make a significant contribution to the collective review.2,3 Beginning with 2017, we will no longer be using a double-blinded review process. Authors will remain blinded to the reviewers of their work, but the reviewers will know the authors of the manuscripts they review. We are making this change for 2 reasons. First and foremost, blinding of authors can be very difficult. Many reviewers with the expertise to review a manuscript are also aware of individuals in the field with similar expertise. Therefore, the reviewer can often “rightly guess” the manuscript's authors. The essential element for any reviewer, whether they know the authors or not, is to declare any real or potential conflicts of interest to the editors. However, if as a reviewer you are able to state you could complete an unbiased review, we would appreciate your contribution to the author's scholarship. Second, blinding of the authors of a manuscript is difficult for the authors. For example, this can often mean disguising the institution where the work was completed. Removing the need to blind the authors allows the institution name and citations of prior work by the author to be included in the text of the manuscript and references. As noted previously,2,3 the peer review process is to highlight the big picture problems and minor issues with a manuscript while providing specific suggestions for addressing each issue in a positive constructive manner. As a reviewer, suggestions for reorganization and elimination of redundancy are welcome, but you do not need to provide line-by-line editing. Each manuscript is read by a Section Editor and a Co-Editor in Chief. If either editor identifies issues with syntax or grammar, we will recommend the authors use an editor to address these deficiencies. In this editorial we would also like to thank all of our 2016 reviewers. We recognize the time it takes to conduct a thoughtful review and your service to the profession is appreciated. Without your dedication and support of the peer review process, we would not have a scholarly journal. Finally, please find the full explanation of our revised reviewer guidelines at http://edmgr.ovid.com/anc/accounts/Reviewer_Guidelines.docx. Thank you!

    "abstract": "In this issue we are continuing our practice of focusing on a clinical issue of concern to most of our readers. Since the turn of the century technological advances have contributed to improved outcomes of high risk newborns requiring surgical intervention. Advancements include the specialization of multiple pediatric medical subspecialties, nurse practitioners, respiratory therapist and most important, bedside nurses. Treatments required of infants who receive surgical intervention is very challenging and often necessitates the use of specialized equipment and intensive or acute care for weeks to months. This treatment requires the expertise of nurses.1 From managing pain immediately post op to preparing parents for a complex discharge nurses are at the forefront of care. In this issue we begin with two articles dedicated to the care of infants with complex surgical conditions. The first article provides an excellent overview of care of the infant with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt common to many neonatal settings. The second article presents a highly complex case of a preterm infant with congenital infantile fibrosarcoma. We will continue this series in the first issue of 2018 and we hope you will enjoy the content. Towards the end of 2018 we have a special series planned focused on congenital infections. From the typical concerns of cytomegalovirus to the new challenges around assessment for the Zika virus we hope you will consider submission of a manuscript. If you have an idea for a manuscript around this topical area, please contact us with your ideas.

    "abstract": "THE INAUGURAL NEC SYMPOSIUM: A TRANSDISCIPLINARY APPROACH TO TACKLE NECROTIZING ENTEROCOLITIS IN US NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNITS A parent-led advocacy group with a mission to eradicate necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) from neonatal intensive care units in the United States has received funding from the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) to hold the first US-based NEC symposium.1 The conference is being organized by the NEC Society and hosted by the University of California at Davis. It will take place in Davis, California, from April 5 to 7, 2017.2 The founder and executive director of the NEC Society, Mrs Jennifer Canvasser, has championed the prevention and early recognition of NEC through activation of parent and research communities since 2014 after the early death of her son from complications of the disease.3,4 Many other parents have joined the cause because of their children's experience with NEC. Unique to the organization is that they have engaged both parent advocates and researchers nationally and internationally to end NEC. A unique quality of the conference is that it will be the first time on US soil that parent advocates, researchers, policy makers, and neonatal clinicians will come together to identify research priorities and action steps that can be taken to tackle the disease. NEC is one disease that has complex etiology and pathophysiology, resulting in very little changes in terms of advancement in both prevention and treatment in recent decades.1,4 NEC often strikes with little warning, and many parents including Jennifer and Noah Canvasser, NEC Society founders, are blindsided by the NEC diagnosis.4 Neonatal nurses' assessment skills often contribute to identifying symptoms of NEC at the bedside—making their attendance at the conference important. Four strategic goals of the conference are listed in their conference brochure.5 Specifically, they are to: Review the current understanding of the pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of NEC; Establish a transdisciplinary collaboration of stakeholders in NEC to accelerate the implementation and standardization of established evidence-based practices that can help reduce the incidence and morbidity of NEC; Explore methods for empowering parents/families and supporting their engagement as part of their baby's care team; and Serve as a venue for researchers to create new collaborations and lines of investigation, including shared clinical databases and tissue banking.5(p5) Conference programming will address the array of issues in the science, practice, and family's experience around NEC.5 Keynote presentations will be delivered by David Hackam, MD, PhD, and Michael Caplan, PhD, MD—both known for their decades-long history of research in the field. Conference topics include strategies to increase awareness of NEC, boost research funding, enhance quality of life for survivors and parents, development of collaborative research (including a biorepository and cross-site clinical trials), the state of the science on NEC pathophysiology, detection methods, treatment options, and NEC-reducing quality improvement initiatives. A combination of concurrent sessions, poster presentations, and roundtable discussion will be used to engage participants. Continuing medical education credit is available, which is recognized by nursing continuing education groups. Registration is open and can be completed at https://necsociety.org/nec-symposium-2017.",

    "abstract": "NANN CELEBRATES NEONATAL NURSES DAY 2017! On September 15, NANN celebrated Neonatal Nurses Day, and all neonatal nurses, with our 2017 theme, “We Save Babies.” As neonatal nurses, you go above and beyond to ensure that each one of your patients and their family members receive the care and compassion they need. The days are long and difficult, but immensely rewarding, and we thank you for sharing your healing hands and generous hearts! On Neonatal Nurses Day, NANN and neonatal nurses celebrated this amazing profession in neonatal intensive care units across the world. Many nurses donned “We Save Babies” and NANN apparel, and hundreds shared social media shout-outs to their units and pictures of their own Neonatal Nurses Day festivities. Thank you for all you do! NANN'S 33rd ANNUAL CONFERENCE What a week NANN had in Providence! Nearly 700 neonatal nurses took Rhode Island by storm, October 11-14, to learn about trending clinical topics and research, network with neonatal peers and industry experts, and enjoy New England in the fall. And while the weather started out as balmy as summer, the week ended with crisp autumn days and nights. NANN attendees find their picture in the 2017 program book. Highlights included a late-breaking session on neonatal abstinence syndrome, an exciting update on artificial womb research, amazing keynote speakers, NANN's first-ever conference buddy program, and so many opportunities for networking and fun. One of the area's first brewpubs played host to the second Annual NANN After Dark, where conference attendees enjoyed an evening out on the town. NANN also took the party to social media, keeping attendees tuned in about on-site surprises, and neonatal nurses near and far updated on all the Providence fun. Check out NANN's Facebook page for our conference slide show and search #NANN2017 on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to get the full story on social media. NANN President, Lori Brittingham grabbing a picture with conference attendees. The NANN Exhibit Hall photo book provided hours of fun! Next up, NANN heads to Anaheim, California, for our 34th Annual Conference, October 17-20, 2018. Look for more details as they become available in the coming months and get ready for an even better conference at #NANNaheim in 2018!",

    "abstract": "FIRST NEONATAL MRI DEVICE CLEARED BY FDA The first neonatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) device designed to scan the head and brain of a neonate has received clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration. The MRI machine uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to generate the images needed to view the head and the brain. The images are produced when protons in fat and water molecules line up in the body, producing scans that are useful in the diagnosis of many neurological diseases.1Embrace Neonatal MRI System was designed for infants with a head circumference of up to 38 cm and weight of 1 to 4.5 kg; the machine was designed in such a way to allow a temperature-controlled incubator to be placed directly into the machine, limiting temperature fluctuations. If the infant does exhibit signs of distress, removal of the infant from the machine takes only approximately 30 seconds. The Embrace Neonatal MRI System is contraindicated for patients weighing more than 4.5 kg, those with a head circumference of more than 38 cm, and infants with metallic or electronically active implants. The MRI system can be placed directly in the neonatal intensive care unit because the machine does not require a safety zone.2 NEW BREAST PUMP KIT CLEANING INSTRUCTIONS New guidelines for how to keep breast pump kits clean have been released following the tragic death of an infant who was 29 weeks old.3,4 The infant developed sepsis at the age of 21 days of life demonstrating positive Cronobacter sakazakii in both her blood and her cerebrospinal fluid. Despite aggressive treatment, the infant developed global developmental delay and required a ventriculoperitoneal shunt and a gastrostomy feeding tube. After extensive investigation, one of the potential contributing factors to the sepsis was the breast pump kit that became contaminated with C sakazakii. Without adequate cleaning or sanitation, the infant was exposed to the deadly bacterial infection. Thus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has introduced new guidelines for parents to facilitate more hygienic expression and handling of human milk.4 Before using the breast pump kit, always wash hands with soap and water. Then assemble and inspect the kit to ensure that no mold or dirt is directly visible in the tubing. Finally, clean pump dial, power switch, and countertop with disinfectant wipes. After using the breast pump, store the milk safely, clean the pumping area, take apart the breast pump, rinse the pump parts, and clean the pump parts either in the dishwasher or by hand. Finally, after cleaning for extra protection, sanitize the pump parts, washbasin, and bottlebrush at least once daily after they have been cleaned. Ensure that items are stored in a clean dry area until needed.3 HIGH PERIPHERAL SEROTONIN IN INFANTS WITH SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME MAY BE A PERIPHERAL BIOMARKER The incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) even after the national Back to Sleep campaign continues to remain at 0.4 per 1000 live births, which is the leading cause of postneonatal infant mortality.5 SIDS is defined as an infant who dies suddenly without explanation despite a complete autopsy, an examination of the death scene, and a review of the clinical history.6 Infants with SIDS appear to have what is called the triple risk hypothesis: underlying vulnerability (poverty, prematurity, gender, race); critical developmental period (infancy); and an outside stressor that precipitates sudden death (asphyxia due to prone sleeping).7–10 The infants with SIDS appear to have respiratory and cardiac abnormalities within the brainstem, combined with the environmental stressors (sleeping position, temperature, exposure to tobacco smoke, sleep state) and a “terminal cascade of hypoxia, bradycardia, apnea, and death,” thus the infants suffer irreversible injury and death occurs.10(p778),11 A new study sought to determine whether peripheral serum serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) levels are altered in SIDS cases compared with deceased infants with known causes, since no known peripheral biomarkers exist for SIDS.12 Sixty-one SIDS cases were identified and 15 control infants were also recruited following a thorough investigation using the postulated triple risk hypothesis. Postmortem results indicated that the serum 5-HT levels for SIDS cases was 177.2 + 15.1 with control infants having 5-HT levels of 91.1 ng/mL + 30.6 ng/ml, which was statistically significant difference. Results confirm that increased serum 5-HT levels in SIDS infants were present when compared with other infants who died within the first year of life. The high levels of serum 5-HT may serve as a potential biomarker for infants.12 Potential use for this may allow for differentiation of different types of neonatal death, allowing for correct diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Learning does not stop with a diploma. To function optimally as patient advocates, practicing nurses want and need to maintain currency and relevance in an ever-changing clinical world. Continuing education comes in many different and creative forms to meet the needs of diverse nurse learners. Conferences, hands-on courses, seminars, webinars, and self-study modules are just a few of the methods used to assist nurses in meeting their personal education goals and fulfilling the requirements for maintaining licensure and certification. Furthermore, nurses may partake in independent reading or view instructional material as part of their everyday practice. With so many opportunities now available to nurses, including many from “for-profit” organizations, how can nurses decide between the many options available for lifelong learning? In considering continuing education opportunities, there are a variety of factors that a nurse can weigh to determine whether the opportunity has enough value to justify its time and expense. SORTING THROUGH THE TERMS There are many terms associated with the “measurement” of continuing education value for nurses. The terms continuing education unit, contact hour, CE hour, CE credit, and CEU tend to be used interchangeably, although there are important differences. The Joint Commission (www.jcinc.com) provides the following guidance to nurses for evaluating marketing materials: Contact hour: This is the amount of “seat time” or “learning time” that has been approved for a specific educational program. Nursing contact hours usually are reported as “CNE” (continuing nursing education) credits. Credit hour (CNE or CME): This is the amount of “seat time” or “learning time” that has been approved for a specific educational program. Physician credit hours usually are reported as “CME” (continuing medical education) credits, although these credits commonly are accepted for fulfilling nursing (especially advanced practice nursing) requirements. Continuing education unit (CEU): This is an oft-misused term in continuing education. The term primarily is used in academic settings as a designation of course time, where 1 hour is equal to 0.10 CEUs. This division by 10 means that 10 hours of instruction (or participation) is equal to 1 CEU. If the term CEU used, it always should contain the decimal point to show the fraction of hours. CEU is a generic reference that can apply to any continuing education activities. PERCEPTIONS: MANDATORY REQUIREMENT OR PERSONAL GROWTH? Although the true benefit of continuing education is the opportunity it presents for personal growth, to further one's profession and to build a stronger foundation for the future, continuing education still is perceived as a “requirement” for many nurses. Many states and professional organizations have minimum continuing professional education obligations that must be met by nurses. National certification maintenance also requires continuing professional education. In some cases, a specific course may meet the requirements for a national organization but may not be acceptable to the guidelines of the state. Furthermore, there often are employer-specific or state-mandated courses that must be completed. It is important to remember that there are benefits to pursuing continuing education that extend well beyond fulfilling professional obligations. Staying current in evidence-based practices can help nurses provide safe and quality patient care and mitigate legal risks and may even support promotion, increased pay, or participation in exclusive workgroups. Educational opportunities also commonly are entwined with professional networking opportunities, whereby nurses can connect with other providers for informal learning and social experiences. Importantly, continuing education is an oft-cited basis for personal and professional satisfaction. NANN SUPPORTS ITS MEMBERS AS LIFELONG LEARNERS NANN is committed to providing neonatal nurses with the resources they need to be lifelong learners by combining many creative educational strategies with relevant and current contents to meet the unique and focused needs of its provider audience (http://nann.org/education/educational-products). NANN's clinical practice publications are a suite of books, reference guides, standard manuals, reference cards, and other publications designed to support nurses by providing a foundation for evidence-based practice. Numerous online modules, including more than 25 developmental different care modules, 10 core content modules, and certification review modules, offer nurses CNE credits for targeted learning. Live webinars are offered with frequency, supporting interactive distance learning. NANN'S 33RD ANNUAL CONFERENCE Perhaps most popular of NANN's learning resources, however, is its annual conference. Not only does the conference offer an opportunity for learners to interact with dozens of neonatal and related experts who present content across a broad spectrum but it also supports networking among providers and provides nurses the opportunity to explore many new products and services in a robust exhibit hall. This year, NANN is hosting its 33rd Annual Conference at the Rhode Island Convention Center (http://nann.org/education/annual-meeting). We hope that you will join us in October at the annual conference, as NANN continues to support you in your quest for lifelong learning!",

    "abstract": "PROPOSED NATIONAL BUDGET AND HEALTHCARE REFORM EFFORTS IMPACT NEONATAL NURSES AND THEIR PATIENTS In March, President Trump released an abbreviated version of the proposed federal fiscal year 2018 budget (America First—A Budget Blueprint to Make America Great Again). The proposed budget identifies numerous changes in funding priorities that are of high relevance to nurses and other healthcare providers. The budget approval process involves examination, negotiation, and revision of items in the proposal by September 30, 2017, to fund the government for fiscal year 2018. This process is directly and indirectly responsive to input from advocacy groups, such as NANN's Health Policy and Advocacy Committee. Of particular interest to NANN members are the following budget recommendations: Funding for substance abuse treatment programs. The proposed budget includes enhanced funding for substance abuse treatment services for Americans struggling with substance abuse disorders. While not specifically targeted for maternal–infant–child populations, congressional approval of this budget item can be expected to broadly grow substance abuse research and programming and thereby provide response to the epidemic of opioid exposure that neonatal providers are encountering. Funding for health professions and nursing workforce programs. To meet funding requirements in other priority areas (such as defense, homeland security, and Veterans Affairs), the proposed budget recommends cuts to the health professions and nursing workforce training programs. Proposed cuts to the Department of Health and Human Services totaling more than $400 million and to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of 20% percent will reduce or defund certain training programs that currently strengthen the healthcare workforce and are currently supported by these institutes. Funding for biomedical and healthcare research. In addition to supporting training programs for the healthcare workforce, the NIH is our nation's leading organization funding biomedical research. Biomedical research funding is therefore also targeted for reduction. It is through NIH funding that high-level research has been supported to develop many of our most efficacious current therapies such as antenatal steroids and high-frequency ventilation. The NIH has enjoyed bipartisan support as the global leader in healthcare innovation. The proposed funding cut of 20% (amounting to approximately $6 billion) is therefore expected to be negotiated during the budget approval process. NANN MEMBERS SENSE A PAUSE IN SCOPING HEALTHCARE REFORM AFTER AMERICAN HEALTH CARE ACT IS WITHDRAWN Repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA, or “Obamacare”) appears to be on hiatus following a March withdrawal of the Republican-backed American Health Care Act from consideration by Congress. Input from nurses, other healthcare providers, and patients was an important factor in the withdrawal of this bill just prior to a vote. With the healthcare reform debate ongoing, providers will need to continue addressing current barriers to care—such as rising health insurance premiums and limited choice of providers—when planning transitions for our vulnerable patients and their families. Developing a healthcare reform proposal that is feasible and patient-centric and provides for efficient, quality healthcare remains an enormous bipartisan challenge and one for which a comprehensive solution is not currently in sight. NANN recognizes that while the healthcare debate is ongoing, it impacts not only healthcare but also our lives and our profession. NANN members and other providers are encouraged to reach out to their state and federal representatives to help these legislators better understand provider challenges, as well as the barriers our patients and their families face in seeking healthcare. Your professional voice is important as our congressional representatives move forward on approving the fiscal year 2018 budget and as they seek to develop a commonsense proposal for healthcare reform.",

    "abstract": "MORE FUNDING FOR CHEZ NICU IN CANADA Over the last few years, live bedside webcams have become more common in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to provide secure video access to NICU parents while separated from their hospitalized infants.1 One hospital system, IWK Health Centre, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, is looking to lessen the strain on the parent–child relationship by taking the bedside webcam approach to the next level. In 2016, the IWK NICU piloted a program called Chez NICU that provided around-the-clock access for NICU parents to visually connect with their infants, learn about the NICU through educational tools, and allow communication between parents and healthcare providers.2,3 The technology is designed to encourage a direct and closer connection between parents and their infants, in particular to increase health outcomes of their infants. The software was developed in conjunction with Cisco Canada and can be used on smartphones, tablets, and personal computers. In line with the purpose of the Canadian Atlantic Innovation Fund,4 the Canadian government announced recently that it will financially provide $3 million to support the Chez NICU project with the intent to improve and enhance the technology, making it available eventually for commercial sale.5 The Chez NICU project is led by Marsha Campbell-Yeo, PhD, RN, NNP-BC, and will aim to hire 7 full-time individuals and 5 student positions.5 NEW PRODUCT FOR MEDELA Several years ago, healthcare providers noticed that tubing for parenteral, enteral, and medical devices at large was not individualized to keep someone from making a connection mistake. Unfortunately, as a result, errors occurred such as administering breast milk through an infant's intravenous catheter. Because of the likelihood for error, groups were formed such as the Global Enteral Device Supplier Association and standards were developed to require specific tubing connectors to reduce connecting errors.6 Enteral feeding devices must meet standards of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which are upheld by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).7 Any new medical device before being manufactured and sold must be reviewed by the FDA and meet the necessary rigor for approval or exemption. Medela is a well-known brand name in the NICU space, known for its breast pump, breast care, and enteral feeding products. Over the years, Medela has adopted the ENFit connectors that are the standard ISO model for tubing and syringe connectors.8 Until now, its product line did not include a low-dose tip syringe, which is needed for small oral doses of medication and feedings that are often warranted in the NICU. Recently, Medela received FDA 510(k) clearance of this new ENFit low-dose syringe product that will increase accuracy of administered small doses.9,10 THREE-DIMENSIONAL PRINTING INCREASING SUCCESS FOR NEONATAL PATIENTS Three-dimensional (3D) printing is a computer-driven mechanism that can build a variety of products one layer at a time. Each of these thin layers allows the final product customization at every level of development.11 In the last 5 years, 3D printing has become more mainstream and, not long ago, has made its debut in becoming a useful tool to care for neonates requiring surgery. Traditionally, surgical practice performing surgery on neonates has been acquired by using mannequins and by gaining real-life experience.12 Although mannequins provide a good substitution for providing realistic anatomical landmarks, there are severe limitations when it comes to understanding the pressure applied and the delicacy of the neonatal body. In addition, many neonates require surgical intervention due to congenital anomalies. Many surgeons are capable of preparing for surgery based on magnetic resonance images and computed tomographic scans, but if these congenital anomalies are discovered in utero, it can be difficult to fully appreciate the anatomical variances until they are standing in the operating room. This is where 3D printing can assist in preparing the surgeon and, in turn, the neonate for success. 3D printing has been a useful tool in surgically correcting cardiac defects13 and providing skeletal replicas for surgeons to appreciate the size and strength of the neonatal body.12 As 3D printing evolves, it is likely that it will not remain just a replica to human anatomy but become a new method of developing usable anatomical structures. How this will affect the NICU is not fully known but makes the future of medicine exciting!",

Angeles, PhD, RN Clinical Abstract Award: Kelsey Bristow, BSN NNP Excellence Award: Susan Reinarz, DNP, NNP-BC, APRN Distinguished Service Award: Cheryl Carlson, PhD, NNP-BC, APRN Navigator Award: Amelia Bieda, PhD, NNP-BC, PNP-BC, APRN Robyn Main Award: Rebecca South, BSN, RNC-NIC Lifetime Achievement Award: Diane L. Spatz, PhD, RN-BC, FAAN, and Frances Strodtbeck, PhD, RN, NNP-BC, FAAN In addition to these spectacular members, NANN also recognizes our chapters each year. Approximately 45% of our members belong to a chapter, and many go above and beyond to be the voice of neonatal nursing. Individual chapter awards are given for membership recruitment and retention, community service, fund-raising efforts, chapter communication, advocacy, educational offerings, and chapter of the year. The following chapters were recognized for their 2016 contributions: Chapter Communications Award: Delaware Valley Chapter Advocacy, Community Service, Educational Offerings, Fund-raising, and Membership Recruitment and Retention Awards: Central California Chapter Chapter of the Year: State of Michigan Chapter At each Annual Educational Conference, NANN holds a Chapter Challenge, which rewards the chapter that has the most members in attendance. This year's winner was the Inland County Chapter, which had 20 members at conference. Congratulations to all of our chapters and our members! 32nd ANNUAL EDUCATIONAL CONFERENCE OVERVIEW The Annual Educational Conference in Palm Springs last October had an amazing turnout with 825 attendees. NANN members were met with not only warm weather and sunshine but also a lot of fun! We kicked off conference with the NANNP business meeting and leadership summit, where NANNP members reviewed data from the neonatal nurse practitioner (NNP) workforce survey, identified potential solutions for neonatal advanced practice registered nurses surrounding education programs, and focused on supporting the novice NNP. NANN partnered with the Vermont Oxford Network (VON) to highlight the opioid epidemic our country is facing with our Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome Preconference. The preconference was led by Madge E. Buus-Frank, DNP, APRN-BS, FAAN, who spearheaded a 3-year VON-sponsored, Internet-based quality improvement collaborative that focused on improving the quality, safety, and value of care for the neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) patient population. Attendees participated in short lectures, engaging discussions, and exercises that provided them with the information and skills needed to care for this vulnerable population. NANN's welcome reception in the exhibit hall included giant games, a henna artist, a fortune teller, a caricaturist, and an interactive coloring mural. Members met with exhibitors, who shared their latest product advancements. After the welcome reception, NANN hosted NANN After Dark, complete with music and dancing, offering attendees a great way to meet other members and relax with friends.Members danced the night away at NANN After Dark.Concurrent sessions included topics ranging from palliative care to human milk, the surgical neonate, and skin care, as well as paper sessions. The conference also included phenomenal general sessions that inspired us to change how we lead and how we practice. In the opening session, Lorraine Dickey, MD, MBA, FAAP, shared the importance and cornerstones of patient- and family-centered care, the care we provide in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).Opening General Session speaker Lorraine Dickey addresses the audience.Dr. Buus-Frank presented the second general session, which focused on improving outcomes for substance-exposed infants, highlighting the 6-fold increase in NAS; the 3-year VON quality improvement initiative; and innovative, improved practices for the care of this patient population.Attendees enjoyed the content presented at one of many sessions offered.During a late-breaking sunrise general session, attendees heard from Pulitzer-nominated author and micro-preemie mom Kelley French. French's presentation was both poignant and funny, sharing her family's journey from the NICU to home. Attendees were moved by her emotional story and the gratitude she shared for the many neonatal nurses who impacted her family's and her daughter's lives. To learn more about the French family's experience, read Juniper: The Girl Who Was Born Too Soon. The 32nd Annual Educational Conference closed with a parent panel that featured Jennifer Degl, Natalie Gordon, and Kara Wahlin, MFT. Jennifer Degl is the author of From Hope to Joy: A Memoir of a Mother's Determination and Her Micro Preemie's Struggle to Beat the Odds. Natalie Gordon is the program facilitator for NICU Helping Hands, a nonprofit organization that develops hospital- and community-based programs that provide education and support for families of NICU babies. Kara Wahlin is a licensed marriage and family therapist who developed NICU Healing, which provides parents with tools for coping and thriving with a medically fragile or premature baby. These mothers shared their stories and experiences surrounding the discharge process, describing practices that were helpful—and some that were not helpful—in their preparation to go home, as well as the importance of communication between healthcare providers and parents. It was a great discussion and provided insight into the stressful world of the NICU parent. The NANN Board of Directors would like to thank the conference planning committee, our speakers, and our vendors for another successful conference!NANN's Annual Conference Planning Chair Heather Goodall (left) with Immediate Past President Regina Grazel.NANN's coloring mural came to life throughout the 32nd Annual Educational Conference.",

Situations arise quickly and unexpectedly and are highly stressful, requiring pediatric registered nurses (pRN) to respond effectively and in a structured manner. In Sweden, pRNs work in all pediatric settings including the neonatal intensive care unit. The experience and actions of pRNs are seldom explored, and studies within this area could develop and improve strategies for neonatal resuscitation situations.To describe pRNs' experiences and actions during neonatal resuscitation.A qualitative interview study based on the critical incident technique was performed. Sixteen pRNs from 4 neonatal intensive care units in Sweden were interviewed.Critical situations were divided into 306 experiences and 271 actions. pRNs' experiences were divided into 2 categories: individual- and team-focused experiences. Critical situations were managed by individual- or team-focused actions.Experiences revealed were variation of alarms, psychological impact, parental presence, structured working methods, the team's interactions, professional experience and resource availability, and the impact of the environment. Actions revealed were being prepared, managing the psychological impact, adopting a professional attitude toward parents, working in a structured way, and competence/resource reinforcement.Developing a structured role distribution within the neonatal resuscitation program and ensuring clear communication in the team during simulation training and in intense situations can increase pRNs' feeling of safety and allow them to further develop their professional role in neonatal resuscitation situations.",

    "abstract": "Background: While hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), infants and their families undergo multiple transitions, and these have been found to be a source of stress for families. Although mixed-room NICU designs allow for infants to benefit from different room types as their needs evolve during their stay, these can necessitate a transfer from one room type to another, which represents a transition for families. As some NICUs change to mixed-room designs, there is a need to better understand the factors impacting these particular transitions from the perception of parents. Purpose: Examine parent perceptions of factors affecting the transition from a 6-bed pod to single family room in a mixed-room design NICU. Methods: Using a qualitative descriptive design, semistructured interviews were conducted with 17 parents whose infant had transitioned from a 6-bed pod to single family room. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and then analyzed using content analysis. Results: Four categories of factors were identified: (1) framing, timing, and comprehensiveness of information provided by staff regarding the transition; (2) parents' perception of advantages and disadvantages of the new space; (3) parent's own well-being and quality of support from staff; and (4) parent's previous NICU and parenting experience. Implications for Practice: Staff should frame the information they provide about this transition in a positive way to help parents adjust. A family-centered approach should also be used to provide tailored information and support to individual families. Implications for Research: Future studies are needed into intraunit transfers including sources of support for parents, as well as staff perceptions of these transitions.",

Parental presence is critical for the medical and psychological well-being of pediatric and neonatal patients. In rereading our article, we do recognize that we used the term “visitor” more than we intended and can understand why that was concerning to readers. Because of the unique distinction between visitors and parents, when the de-escalation algorithm was expanded to other units in the hospital, there was a distinctive algorithm made for visitors that validates our belief in the difference and importance of parental presence. We do, however, feel like a de-escalation strategy for parents remains a priority in units such as ours to ensure the safety of our staff. While parents are critical to the care of infants, it is not acceptable for anyone to verbally abuse, berate, or threaten staff. It is key for nursing leaders to support a therapeutic environment for patients, parents, and staff. —Ann Schwoebel, MSN, RNC-NIC Clinical Nurse Education Specialist Intensive Care Nursery —Elizabeth Quigley, MSN, RNC-OB Nurse Manager Intensive Care Nursery Pennsylvania Hospital Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",

    "abstract": "The Advances in Neonatal Care (ANC) Editorial Board announces that the journal section Ethical Issues in Neonatal Care is now titled Ethics and Equity in Neonatal Care. In recent years, ANC editorials and an invited paper have addressed health disparities secondary to racism and inequities that have been reported in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) across the United States and have advocated for change. This work includes “Speaking Up to Address Racism and Health Inequity” (February 2021),1 “Disparities Research in the Neonatal Arena” (August 2021),2 “A Call to Action to Fight for Equity and End Necrotizing Enterocolitis Disparities” (October 2021),3 “Inclusivity and Respect: Beyond Personal Pronouns” (April 2022),4 and “Becoming an Antiracist Neonatal Community” (February 2021)5 to highlight a few. Furthermore, the National Association of Neonatal Nurses (NANN) published position statement #3700, “Racial Disparity in the NICU,” that endorsed “healthcare equality for all infants regardless of race, parental economic or educational status, or geographic area” and highlighted several recommendations for elevating awareness around these issues, encouraging diversity in the workforce, examining our own personal biases and beliefs, and working with diverse families in the NICU and through their transition to home (June 2020).6 Social determinants of health have a major impact on people's health, well-being, and quality of life and contribute to wide health disparities and inequities related to healthcare access, quality of healthcare services and experiences, and health outcomes. The renaming of the section is a natural extension of this previous work and a continued response to the calls for heightened awareness around these important issues. In the United States, approximately half a million infants are admitted annually to an NICU. Despite medical advances, infants born to Black, Hispanic, and rural7,8 mothers experience worse health outcomes and higher rates of prematurity and mortality than those born to White, urban mothers.9 Such outcomes are linked to disparities in healthcare10–17 and lower satisfaction with care.18 Disparities specific to the NICU are well documented, with minority infants less likely to receive recommended care.10,19,20 For those infants at high risk for neurodevelopmental disabilities and ongoing need for specialized services, the impact of these disparities is magnified even further.19 Family advocates also voice a lack of equitable, family-centered care, which is based on a respectful partnership between healthcare providers (HCPs) and families.21,22 However, negative interactions with HCPs may be precipitated by stereotyping, bias, and failures in communication for minority families.20,21,23,24 Barriers may result that then limit family involvement in activities, such as breastfeeding and skin-to-skin care,25 which are central to infant care. Furthermore, a systematic review of the literature identified racial/ethnic disparities in neonatal intensive care in all levels of structure, process, and outcome measures and recommended that targeted efforts could improve equity in care delivery.12 In healthcare, ethics and ethical conduct are recognized as important tenets of practice that set standards of right and wrong that can guide clinical decision-making, as well as allocation of valuable resources. Equity relates to fairness and is grounded in the ethical principle of justice.26 It also recognizes that not all patients and families start from the same place. This fact must be acknowledged so that these imbalances can be not only mitigated but also ultimately ameliorated. Disparity must also be considered in the context of not only those who are racial minorities but also for those considered to be minorities in terms of their gender, sexuality, and religion.5 Inequities in healthcare are an injustice and thus an ethical issue. Furthermore, the NANN Code of Ethics27 describes that ethical behavior is integral to the foundation of nursing and outlines fundamental nursing principles not only for patient care but also for participation in the Association. It also adopts a “responsibility for articulating neonatal nursing values, the integrity of the profession and its practice and for shaping social policy” from Provision 9 of the American Nurses Association Code of Ethics for Nurses.28 As a nursing profession, we must aim to provide safe, efficient, and quality nursing services across the entire population in all health settings.29 The body of evidence around disparities and health inequities in the NICU is growing; however, this is a topic that needs continued attention in clinical practice and research. Together with the ANC editors, I invite you to submit your original manuscripts for consideration for publication in the Ethics and Equity in Neonatal Care section so that others may learn through your work. We welcome any manuscript that discusses health inequities in the NICU through an ethical lens. Manuscripts may be original research, systematic or narrative reviews of the literature, quality improvement or evidence-based practice projects, or other type of project. Together we have an opportunity to make a difference through the sharing of our research, clinical practice, policy, and education initiatives. We hope that the new focus of this section will continue to increase attention and heighten awareness around racism, discrimination, prejudice, bias, and inequity so that ultimately care for all infants and their families can be improved. I hope you will consider submitting your work. If you have any questions regarding a potential submission, please contact me at [email protected] to discuss. —Christine A.

    "abstract": "Background: Reduction in oxygen delivery to developing kidneys of premature infants may be an important source for acute kidney injury in premature infants. Purpose: To describe changes in continuous kidney oxygenation (RrSO 2 ) measures before, during, and after routine diaper changes. Methods: Non–a priori analysis of a prospective cohort that received continuous measurement of RrSO 2 with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) over the first 14 days of life demonstrating acute RrSO 2 drops surrounding diaper changes. Results: In total, 26 of 38 (68%) infants (≤1800 g) from our cohort exhibited acute drops in RrSO 2 that temporally correlated with diaper changes. Mean (SD) RrSO 2 baseline prior to each diaper change event was 71.1 (13.2), dropped to 59.3 (11.6) during diaper change, and recovered to 73.3 (13.2). There was a significant difference between means when comparing baseline to diaper change ( P &lt; .001; 95% CI, 9.9 to 13.8) and diaper change to recovery ( P &lt; .001; 95% CI, −16.9 to −11.2). The mean decrease in RrSO 2 during diaper change averaged 12 points (17%) below 15-minute RrSO 2 mean prior to diaper change, with quick recovery to prediaper change levels. No decreases in SpO 2 , blood pressure, or heart rate were documented during the intermittent kidney hypoxic events. Implications for Practice and Research: Routine diaper changes in preterm infants may increase the risk for acute reductions in RrSO 2 as measured by NIRS; however, the impact on kidney health remains unknown. Larger prospective cohort studies assessing kidney function and outcomes related to this phenomenon are needed.",

The cardiovascular manifestations that have been described in the setting of COVID-19 infection in neonates are tachycardia and hypotension, but information regarding cardiac arrhythmias is scarce, while the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on myocardial function is still not well established. Clinical Findings: We present a case of a neonate admitted with fever and nasal congestion. Primary Diagnosis: The neonate was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) was diagnosed during his hospitalization in the neonatal intensive care unit. Interventions: The neonate was under treatment with intravenous fluid repletion, intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics, and continuous hemodynamic monitoring. SVT resolved spontaneously, while the team was preparing application of further supportive measures with a bag of ice on the infant's face. Outcomes: The neonate was discharged in good condition on day 14 post-admission, with no further recurrence of SVT. Follow-up visits were scheduled with the cardiologist. Practice Recommendations: SVT in full-term or premature neonates can be a clinical manifestation of COVID-19 infection. Both neonatologists and neonatal nurse practitioners should be prepared to deal with cardiological manifestations of COVID-19 infection in neonates.",

    "abstract": "Dear Editor, It was of great interest and pleasure to read the recent editorial, \"Donor Human Milk Is Not the Solution.\" I concur with many opinions articulated in the editorial; however, resulting from my personal experience as a parent of a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) infant, I wish to provide additional insight. I agree with the antenatal education proposed by the author. I went into premature labor at 26 weeks' gestation. I was hospitalized and medicated to delay labor for 4 days before giving birth. I recall a great deal of time in hospital waiting before labor reestablished—time (in comparison with postdelivery events) that was relatively calm and optimistic, which could have been used to prepare me to express. As this was not the case, I presumed I would not be able to breastfeed as the infant would be intubated, incubated, and too small to feed at the breast. I did not know that expressing was an option. I concur there is a need to provide expression assistance until mothers can do so independently. Despite not being told antenatally that I could express my milk for our premature infant, I was happy—although somewhat surprised—that within 2 hours of giving birth, and during the following 12 hours, I was shown by 2 midwives how to express colostrum by hand using sterile syringes. Being shown by midwives how to express was extremely valuable and the main reason I started, and persevered, with expressing. After being discharged from the care of the midwifery team, and while still expressing colostrum, a neonatal nurse showed me how to use a breast pump. It was a demoralizing experience as no milk was expressed using the pump. Regardless of being shown how to use the breast pump once, I still needed support, guidance, and reassurance with using it, which I did not get from NICU staff. Initially, I was not confident to express by the incubator and did not want to ask if a neonatal nurse could leave our son's incubator so they could show me how to express. To me, their role was to care for our son and not to show me something I should be able to do as a mother. Therefore, I believe that support from a dedicated expressing support person would be invaluable. I share the author's opinion that mothers should have access to hospital-grade breast pumps; however, appropriate equipment is required to ensure equipment is sterilized. While in the NICU, I was urged to express at least 8 times a day and at least once in the night to maintain a milk supply. Mothers were able to express beside the incubator or in a dedicated expressing room where breast pumps and cold-water sterilizing units for each mother were stored. Healthcare assistants were responsible for cleaning the area and refreshing the sterilizing units. I was also able to rent a hospital-grade breast pump from the NICU to express at night when away from the NICU; however, the NICU did not provide a cold-water sterilizing unit or the sterilizing solution required. I recall how challenging it was to obtain these essential items as a shocked, scared, and sleep-deprived first-time parent to an extremely premature infant in the NICU, with the added complexity of navigating pandemic lockdown restrictions. Access to a breast pump is almost pointless if you are unable to sterilize pumping equipment. Although the editorial did not refer to it, it is my strong opinion that the importance of hygiene when expressing human milk needs to be better communicated to NICU parents. Unlike feeding at the breast, parents have the additional hygienic burden of cleaning and sterilizing the pump and feeding vessels, as well as ensuring safe storage and transportation of expressed human milk. Given my background in food safety, I asked many questions regarding infection control when expressing. My supposed \"paranoia about germs,\" seemed to annoy some members of the NICU team, whereas others were empathetic and reassured me that I was doing the right thing. When asked, the recommended hygiene practices included using the cold-water sterilizing unit, date-labeling and refrigerating human milk immediately after expressing, and transporting human milk to the NICU in a cool bag. All information was verbal; no written information was provided to me to refer back to when needed. I knew hygiene was essential to prevent my expressed milk being a potential source of infection; however, discussion always focused upon the frequency of expressing and quantity expressed. During our 32 days in the NICU, I saw several practices that made me question other mothers' hygiene perceptions and practices when expressing. For example, one mother would remove the flanges, valves, connectors, and milk bottles from the cold-water sterilizing unit and rinse all component parts in tap water before putting together and attaching to the pump to express milk. Another mother would use the disposable paper towels from the hand washing sink to dry the bottles and equipment after removing from the sterilizing solution before using. I saw sterilized component parts dropped and used without further sterilizing, and sterilized equipment handled with unwashed hands. I believe that any communication or educational efforts to support mothers to express must inform and enable parents to implement appropriate hygiene practices to help safeguard vulnerable infants. Furthermore, I believe women should be supported when they must stop expressing. Unfortunately, my expressing and breastfeeding journey came to an end when our son died after 32 days of life. We left without our infant, but with medication prescribed to suppress lactation. I did not want to take the medication, as expressing was the only thing I'd ever done as a mother, and I wanted to stop gradually, on my own terms; however, there was no support or information given on how to safely stop expressing, which resulted in mastitis. Similarly, no options were presented if I wanted to donate my milk. Advice and information need to be appropriate to the wants and needs of the mother. Although my response is not based on clinical experience, it is because of my experience as a NICU parent. In summary, I believe that: Information detailing the importance of, and how to, express mother's own milk needs to take a multiresource approach, to ensure the information not only is suitable for different learning preferences (eg, in multiple formats—written, verbal, visual) but also demonstrated. This needs to be on multiple occasions by the multidisciplinary team to increase credibility and to allow sufficient opportunities for questioning, support, and reassurance. Emphasis should be placed on the critical importance of ensuring the hygiene of equipment used to express human milk. Such information should be delivered to both parents, as non–birth parents may play an essential role in supporting milk expression, by cleaning the pump, sterilizing equipment, or labeling, storing, and transporting expressed human milk. Mothers should be able to not only access hospital-grade pumps to use both in the NICU and at home but also have access to essential sterilizing equipment/solution. There is a need to understand the impact of lactation suppression upon the grieving process and ensure bereaved mothers are supported in safe lactation suppression. I will always be thankful for the care and support we received as a NICU family. I hope my response to the editorial will be insightful to those who support the parents of infants receiving care in the NICU. —Ellen W.

    "abstract": "Thanks to your hard work, Advances in Neonatal Care (ANC) is thriving! ANC is considered the number 1 membership benefit of belonging to the National Association of Neonatal Nurses (NANN). We are grateful for your readership and support through manuscript submissions, peer review, and letters to the editor. Our impact factor has grown steadily over the past 10 years and has continued to be stable even with the effects of the Pandemic and changes in the publication world. Yet, we want to make sure that your hard work published in Advances in Neonatal Care gets even greater notice. Have you ever wondered about the best way to choose a title for your manuscript? Or, whether it really matters? Should your title be short, or long? Should it be catchy or should it be strictly scientific? Are some title choices better than others? These are important questions to consider, so you can choose the best title for your manuscript. The title of your manuscript is the first impression of your work. Thus, we believe that being deliberate in choosing a title does matter. You have spent maybe years completing a study or project and then months writing the manuscript. Why would you not want to make sure that you chose the best title for your work? Soler1 scientifically examined journal article titles and found 2 distinct features. Titles are designed to provide information about the article while at the same time the title is designed to be concise.1 A short title can be more enticing while a long title has the potential to detract from the article content. Good titles are generally 10 to 15 words in length; titles of more than 15 words are likely cumbersome and wordy to readers, leading them to dismiss the remainder of the article as important.1,2 As such, articles with shorter titles are cited more often than those with longer titles.2 Brevity seems to be very important to the process of choosing a title for your article. However, even more importantly, the title makes the article discoverable when individuals are looking for specific content. For example, now that many types of published works encourage a systematic search of the literature to find supporting evidence, the first level of searching is usually through titles and abstracts. If the title does not reflect the essence of the work, it could potentially be overlooked for inclusion in the review. In addition, making sure that the work is discoverable is important to authors because it increases their reputation and credibility in the field. Getting published is not easy. It is professionally fulfilling to tell others that you are published but it's even more rewarding to have someone stop you and say, I read your article and used your findings to change practice in our NICU, thank you. None of this can happen if other neonatal care providers don't find the article. In addition, when the article is not found, science does not grow systematically. When reports and studies are not connected together such that the findings from one study lead to the next, there is no integration of the work into science and over time this loss of knowledge has the potential to waste time and money. With digitalization, our world is becoming more connected and global, yet if the article is not found, we don't learn from each other's challenges or successes in different countries and settings. We even potentially slow the growth of knowledge. In general, article titles should be simple and direct. Some authors believe that choosing a catchy title that is humorous or suggestive (contains a pun) can make their work more attractive for readers; however, in the scientific literature that practice can actually have just the opposite effect and should for the most part be avoided.2–4 Writing a scholarly manuscript is a formal process and it is somewhat an expectation that the title will be formal as well. A formal title says that this work is scholarly, pay attention. In general, the title should also contain some of the key words submitted with the manuscript. In a similar vein, the title should not include regional descriptors; these could limit the applicability of the findings unless the region is very specific to the outcomes.4 For example, does a study on skin-to-skin care have the same applicability if conducted in Australia as opposed to Germany or the United States? Only the authors can answer this question, but it is important to consider whether the results are truly applicable elsewhere and how they can be translated to other global settings. Thus, region should be included in the title only if it adds to the scientific value of the work. Some journals provide specific guidelines for titles. For example, some journals prohibit titles that are questions (interrogative titles) or titles punctuated with a colon (compound titles). Advances in Neonatal Care provides a degree of freedom in choosing a title that we hope authors will use to best highlight their work. Titles can be descriptive, declarative, compound, or interrogative.2,3 Each of these types has a specific purpose. Manuscript titles have the potential to influence the impact of your work and who might be attracted to your work. Titles can either bring a reader in and lead him or her to read the abstract and potentially the manuscript or they can turn a reader off causing him or her to overlook the work. The title should summarize the work. Descriptive titles tell readers what the authors did but may not always provide the full conclusion of their work. For example, “Factors That Contribute to Family Centered-Care.” Although this title is short and provides direction that could entice the reader to keep reading the article, the title does not inform readers about the specific factors or what conclusions the authors found. If a specific factor contributes more to the science than other factors that information could be lost by choosing this title. Declarative titles state the results or conclusions of the manuscript. This type of title is often used for research articles. For example, “Cortisol Levels Are Decreased After Preterm Infant Massage.” Usually, these title statements are written in past or present tense. Past tense tells the reader that this was found in the study while present tense leads the reader to believe that this declaration is more generalizable. Past tense in the title might be best for pilot or exploratory findings as opposed to the use of present tense for findings from large, randomized trials. Although using present tense may seem to make the title appear stronger, present tense also has the potential to mislead or misrepresent the true findings within the manuscript report if the sample size was small or the results are not easily generalizable in the clinical setting. As such, present tense should be used with caution. Interestingly, many journals restrict the use of compound titles, although they are cited more frequently.3,4 Compound titles often go from general to specific such as “Necrotizing Enterocolitis: Assessment and Management.” Compound titles sometimes provide a means to be more concise than using other title styles because sometimes words can be deleted without loss of meaning for the reader. However, the use of punctuation in titles needs to be thoughtfully considered and used only when other choices do not fit or make the title too long. Questioning (interrogative) titles flirt with the reader and they can seem more lively, but there is a weakness in asking a question in the title in that no direction for the results or direction of the manuscript is shared. It has been noted that while these articles may be downloaded more often, yet they are cited less often than those with declarative or descriptive titles.3,4 In summary, we believe that choosing a title should be deliberate and while it is often the last thing an author does in preparing his or her manuscript for publication, it is important to be thoughtful in the process. To that end our vision is that Advances in Neonatal Care is the FIRST-place neonatal nurses and neonatal care providers go to for the best evidence to support caregiving of NICU infants and families; please choose a title that best represents your work. In addition to the title, please also thoughtfully consider the key words chosen to go with your manuscript. Advances in Neonatal Care allows authors to submit up to 10 key words. We encourage authors to provide a through list of key words. This is another way to make the article discoverable. Authors can do this by examining their references, working with a librarian to explore MeSH terms and even conducting a search with the key words they choose to make sure that an article like theirs does indeed come into the search. Choosing 10 key words can help ensure that the work is discoverable and does contribute appropriately to the science. Again, we thank you for your readership and for your submissions to Advances in Neonatal Care. —Jacqueline M.

    "abstract": "Background: Neonatal care has advanced significantly in recent years, yet racial health inequities persist in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), with infants from racial and ethnic minority groups less likely to receive recommended treatment. Healthcare providers acknowledge that there are steps that can be taken to increase knowledge and awareness regarding health inequities. Purpose: To better understand current health equity–related initiatives in the neonatal community and solicit feedback from National Association of Neonatal Nurses (NANN) membership about advancing racial equity within the organization. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in January 2021. The anonymous, onetime survey was distributed to active NANN members via SurveyMonkey and included questions related to racial equity initiatives, recommendations, and demographics. Data analysis was conducted using an exploratory approach using descriptive statistics, and thematic analysis was used to summarize responses to open-ended questions. Results: There were 325 members who completed the full survey, of whom were White (83%), female (96%), staff nurses (42%), and those with more than 16 years of experience (69%), and most (69%) were familiar with NANN's racial equity position statement. Recommendations were summarized into the following themes: (1) research, (2) education, (3) workforce diversity, (4) communication, (5) scholarships, (6) resources, and (7) community outreach. Implications for Practice and Research: NANN members offered clear and actionable recommendations to advance health equity within the neonatal community and organization, which included offering more diversity, inclusion, and equity education at the annual conferences, in ANC articles, and newsletters, and the creation of scholarships or reduced membership fees to encourage diverse enrollment in the organization.",

    "abstract": "Background: Preterm-born children are at increased risk for deficits in executive function (EF). EF is a set of cognitive processes including inhibition, attention, memory, and decision-making, among others. Bilingualism, operationalized as productive capacity in 2 languages (ie, English and Spanish), may enhance EF in children born preterm and in term-born children. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of bilingualism on executive functioning in bilingual and monolingual preterm and term-born children using a robust measure of bilingualism. Methods: This study examined the impact of bilingualism on EF in 17 monolingual or bilingual preterm-born children, aged 6 to 7. The preterm-born sample was also compared with a normed, term-born sample of 38 monolingual, typically developing 6- to 7-year-olds. Results: On the Creature Counting task of EF, bilingual preterm-born children performed with more accuracy and total switches than monolingual preterm-born children. There was no difference in accuracy between the term-born and entire preterm-born samples. The bilingual, preterm-born children performed more accurately than the term-born sample. Implications for Practice and Research: This preliminarily suggests bilingualism confers an advantage to preterm-born children's EF. Further research is needed on bilingual advantage of preterm-born children.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy (cNIRS) is a noninvasive technology used to trend cerebral perfusion at the bedside. cNIRS has potential as a valuable tool in the evaluation of infants with suspected hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Trending cerebral perfusion with cNIRS can provide information regarding cerebral metabolism as HIE is evolving, which may offer insight into the extent of brain injury.The purpose of this systematic review is to investigate the use of cNIRS as a neurocritical tool in the management of neonatal HIE by evaluating its ability to detect acute neurological compromise, including acute brain injury and seizure activity, as well as its potential to identify infants at high risk for long-term neurodevelopmental impairment.A literature search was conducted using PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases to review articles investigating cNIRS technology in the acute management of HIE.Eight studies were identified and included in this systematic review. Correlations were observed between cNIRS trends and neurological outcomes as later detected by MRI. cNIRS has potential as a bedside neuromonitoring tool in the management of HIE to detect infants at high risk for brain injury.Existing research supports the value of trending cNIRS in HIE management. Documented normal cNIRS values for both term and preterm infants in the first few days of life is approximately 60% to 80%. A steadily increasing cNIRS reading above an infant's baseline and a value of more than 90% should prompt further evaluation and concern for significant neurological injury.",

Evidence Acquisition: A review of literature was conducted using keywords in PubMed, Google Scholar, and CINAHL databases from 2018 to 2023. Results: Although assessment techniques for the neonatal foot remain the same, recent nonsurgical treatment options are available for a variety of neonatal foot deformities. Early recognition allows for proper evaluation of foot deformities and corrective measures. Implications for Practice and Research: Neonatal providers equipped with knowledge of common foot problems can provide support and anticipatory guidance to families.",

    "abstract": "Background: There have been few reports on whether family integrated care (FIC) can help premature infants with moderate to severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) to shorten the duration of home oxygen therapy (HOT). Purpose: To investigate the effect of FIC on the duration of HOT in premature infants with moderate to severe BPD. Methods: The subjects were retrospectively selected from premature infants with moderate to severe BPD in our center between June 2019 and December 2021. Patients were divided into the FIC group (n = 47) and the non-FIC group (n = 34). For univariate analysis, t test, Mann–Whitney U test, Pearson χ 2 test, or Fisher exact test was performed to explore the differences between the 2 groups. For multivariate analysis, simple and multiple linear regression was conducted to explore the effect of FIC on the duration of HOT. Results: (1) The duration of HOT and length of stay after grouping were significantly shorter in the FIC group than in the non-FIC group ( P &lt; .05). (2) The results of linear regression further revealed that FIC could significantly shorten the duration of HOT (simple linear regression, FIC [A] B : −12.709, 95% confidence interval (CI): −21.665 to −3.753; multiple linear regression, FIC [B] B : −11.419, 95% CI: −18.055 to −4.783). Implications for Practice and Research: FIC improved the optimal target oxygen saturation ratio before discharge and shortened the duration of HOT in premature infants with moderate and severe BPD. FIC should be promoted in China's neonatal intensive care units, though it puts forward new requirements for nursing education and training.",

These punctures can be painful and have associated risks, emphasizing the importance of keeping attempts to a minimum. Purpose: The purpose of this quality improvement initiative was to determine whether using transillumination to visualize arteries before and while obtaining a blood sample would improve outcomes in neonatal patients. Methods: Quantitative data were collected pre- and postimplementation of education for the use of a transillumination device for arterial punctures on neonates in a level III neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Outcomes followed included the success rate, average time to obtain a blood sample, and the average number of sticks to obtain a blood sample. Data were collected on 47 blood draw attempts in the control group (preimplementation) and 19 blood draw attempts in the experimental group (postimplementation). Results: A statistical analysis concluded that the use of the studied transillumination device does positively affect the incidence of successful blood draws, particularly for the novice NICU nurse. In addition, the average number of sticks to obtain a blood sample significantly decreased in the experimental group. Finally, the average time to obtain a blood sample using the device was not impacted in this study. Implications for Practice and Research: Use of a transillumination device does appear to result in improved outcomes for arterial punctures in neonatal patients. More research is needed to confirm these findings due to the small sample size of the study.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Mothers of infants in most Sri Lankan neonatal units are required to be “inpatients” during the entirety of their infant’s stay. This traditional practice is closely aligned to the relatively newer model of family-integrated care. Purpose: Exploration of parent’s views regarding the expectation for mothers to remain in hospital for the entire duration of their infant’s neonatal unit stay. Methods: Cross-sectional study of parents of infants admitted to the University neonatal unit of Colombo North Teaching Hospital, Ragama, Sri Lanka, using self-administered questionnaires in 2017. Results: We found that 40% (19/48) of mothers and 43% (16/37) of fathers preferred that mothers traveled from home, rather than being inpatients continuously, in order to care for older children, receive psychological support from family, and also due to other practical inconveniences of living in the hospital. The main barriers to women being able to travel from home were the need to safely provide expressed human milk for their hospitalized infants and current hospital administrative and societal attitudes. Implications for Practice and Research: We found that a considerable number of parents with infants in the neonatal intensive care unit in Sri Lanka would like the option of the mother being able travel from home, rather than being confined to hospital. To facilitate this option, changes in hospital protocols and further research into storage and transportation of expressed mother’s milk will be required. Improving facilities in hospital and providing more opportunities for families to interact with infants in neonatal intensive care unit will encourage mothers to remain in hospital continuously.",

    "abstract": "As clinicians in Neonatology, we understand both the benefits and risks of advancements in medical science and modern technology. As we are able to save more neonates on the cusp of viability, we acknowledge with that comes the greater risk of morbidity and mortality. As a function of that morbidity comes the risk of requiring surgery. Some neonates, while far beyond the limits of viability, will require surgical intervention for a congenital indication, whereas others may still require surgery for an acquired indication. Regardless of your geographic practice location or the level of the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) you practice in, it is very likely you have been involved in the care of a neonate who has required, or will go on to require, a surgical intervention. This Special Surgical Series was conceived and executed with you and the infants you care for in mind. Nurses and nurse practitioners in the NICU care for neonates undergoing surgical procedures for diagnoses such as patent ductus arteriosus, necrotizing enterocolitis, abdominal wall defects, Hirschsprung disease, bowel obstruction or atresia, tracheoesophageal fistula/esophageal atresia, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, retinopathy of prematurity, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), inguinal hernia(s), malrotation/volvulus, and cardiac indications. As the surgical neonate spans all gestational ages, we as NICU clinicians must be aware of the possible comorbidities or complications that may affect our surgical population. It is important to continue to provide developmental care during the critical pre- and postoperative periods, as well as to provide positive oral stimulation for neonates who won't be able to feed enterally for some period after surgery or more importantly nil per os (NPO) for extended periods of time, in particular, neonates with long-gap esophageal atresia, gastroschisis, and congenital heart disease.1 We must empower mothers to continue to provide human milk for their surgical neonate, as human milk is often the key to enteral success after surgery.2 We must also provide timely, thorough, and accurate information regarding the diagnosis and surgical procedure. This will give families the power to work through the diagnosis and also be able to anticipate the perioperative course and potential complications or setbacks. In the sample of articles for the Special Surgical Series, you will find diagnoses ranging from simple to complex, affecting the span of all gestational ages and including uncommon complications of common surgical procedures. In part I of the series, there is a comprehensive review of IVH and ventriculoperitoneal shunt, a rather commonplace procedure in the NICU. This article will serve the novice NICU nurse providing a foundation of knowledge as well as the more experienced nurse as a review of the diagnosis and surgical procedure. Part I of the series also brings the rarest diagnosis of the series as congenital infantile fibrosarcoma (CIF). In this case presentation, CIF is presented in a premature infant and highlights not only the natural history of the diagnosis but also the treatment implications in the setting of a premature infant. Part II of the series showcases another foundation article that will again benefit the novice and expert nurses alike. This is a review of esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula. Another common diagnosis and surgical procedure in the NICU is gastroschisis with abdominal wall closure. A second paper in part II of the series undertakes abdominal compartment syndrome—an uncommon complication to this common procedure. Rounding out the series is the presentation of a topic that is just now emerging in our field and may be new to most of us. Telemedicine utilizes modern technology to aid in the transition to home for the medically complex surgical neonate. Preparing families for discharge with a medically complex infant who may require multiple medications, respiratory support, equipment for feeding and monitoring, and wounds or ostomy is paramount to a successful transition home. NICU clinicians are perfectly poised to provide this invaluable education. Once home, however, families may need continued support to bridge the gap between the primary pediatrician and the surgeon. This support comes in the form of telemedicine. Telemedicine is the merging of modern technology with the medical community, and its emergence in the care of the medically fragile neonate is very exciting for our field.3 Utilizing telemedicine to evaluate the infant and the family after discharge allows for an additional layer of comfort for the family as the infant is evaluated by a team familiar with their child and the hospital course.4 In addition, telemedicine has been shown to decrease travel time for the family, number of emergency department visits, number of rehospitalizations, and overall healthcare costs.3,4 As I reflect on this Special Surgical Series, I would like to thank the authors for their time and dedication to the surgical neonate, as well as for their willingness to share their knowledge and educate their peers. In addition, I would like to thank our editors, Drs Brandon and McGrath, for the opportunity to bring this Special Series to you and also for the vision to highlight the Surgical Neonate. I hope you found this Special Surgical Series both interesting and applicable to your practice. I also hope the works presented here will serve to expand your knowledge of the issues affecting the surgical neonate and help enhance your practice when caring for a vulnerable neonate requiring surgery—regardless of the indication.",

    "abstract": "A recent article published by researchers of Stanford University detailed significant racial and ethnic disparities in the quality of care among California neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).1 This article captured much attention over the last several months because it was one of the first to provide evidence for the association between the quality of care and racial/ethnic disparities. Their data demonstrated persistent and continued racial and ethnic disparities between and within NICUs.1 In other words, nonwhite and Hispanic infants had worse outcomes within the same NICU. Then, in January 2018, another article was published by New York City researchers documenting very similar results: that nonwhite infants (ie, black and Hispanic infants) were more likely to be cared for at poorer-performing hospitals with higher rates of morbidity and mortality.2 This study confirmed that the quality performance of a birth hospital contributes to infant morbidity and mortality differentially for white, black, and Hispanic infants. In both of these studies, findings demonstrated that black and Hispanic infants were disproportionately likely to receive care at lower-performing hospitals2 and outcomes were also worse for nonwhite infants even within the same hospital.1 These studies should make us uncomfortable because they make it very hard to ignore the fact that nonwhite infants (may) are not receiving the highest quality of neonatal care. The results from these studies were compiled from large, population-based birth records with strong statistical analysis and rigor of findings. The results suggest that the quality of care from neonatal providers (eg, nurses, doctors, practitioners) may be different based upon race and ethnicity bringing into question whether neonatal care providers actually provide impartial, unbiased care. A nationally representative birth cohort study from 2007 compared racial and ethnic differences between the United States and England.3 Even in England, where universal healthcare is standard, racial and ethnic disparities persisted for nonwhite infants. To best sort out some of these complex issues, researchers in this study developed a measure of social economic status that included both employment and poverty along with education. Social economic status, employment status, and other social risk factors did not explain the outcome differences among racial and ethnic groups.3 We believe that neonatal caregivers think that they are providing consistent high-quality care on a day-to-day basis; however, we must acknowledge the potential presence of unconscious biases and systemic issues influencing racial and ethnic disparities in NICUs across the nation. If, while reading this, you are saying to yourself, “No way! I know that I give the same quality of care to all the infants I care for, regardless of race or family characteristics”: this may be your personal reality. You may not consciously provide different care to the white or black infant in your assignment, but we all have implicit biases and personal judgments that influence how we interact with that infant's family. For example, do you treat all families the same way at all times? This also includes treating families as unique individuals. Do you ever choose to not encourage a family to participate in care because they seem uncaring, unclean, or just not right for this baby? Psychologists define implicit bias as the negative evaluation of another person based on membership as a part of a group or personal characteristic, and this can be either overt or covert.4 Within nursing curriculum, students routinely receive education about personal attitudes and beliefs and about how to put these aside to be professional and “nonjudgmental” providing care for all patients with equality. Yet, if we only encourage future nurses to not be something without giving them the tools to adequately address or understand what their implicit biases may be, how will they actually be able to practice impartial care once they leave nursing school? How can we provide impartial high-quality care if we are not aware or even understand how our own personal biases and values influence the care we provide? Just as a medical-surgical nurse may hold biases toward overweight patients, NICU nurses may have similar biases toward substance-abusing mothers whose infant is admitted for neonatal abstinence syndrome. As providers in a difficult environment like the NICU, where outrageous but real stories are often used as trading cards among the staff, informal conversations and thoughts about implicit biases are commonplace. Take for instance these examples: a homeless mother who delivers a 500-g infant, who is now living at the Ronald McDonald House and not visiting as much as the unspoken NICU staff expectations; or, a surgical infant born to non–English-speaking family who is unstable and requiring constant changes to the plan of care and care providers fail to provide them the same level of interaction because it is too hard to use the interpreter system as compared with the time spent with a mother who visits daily and meaningfully engages with staff. Admittedly, there are differences in the care that could be provided in each of these cases potentially based on group or family characteristics. To reduce racial and ethnic disparities, care providers must assess how their care may differ between patients based on implicit or unintentional biases. This will require honest and likely uncomfortable reflections and discussions with patients and co-workers. Until we confront these issues head on, racial and health disparities will continue to result in poorer neonatal outcomes for disadvantaged populations. Some may argue that the results from these studies are biased themselves due to hospital characteristics or the known rates of premature birth among particular racial groups; however, the Stanford researchers1 make a compelling point that racial and ethnic disparities persist when controlling for hospitals that cared for more black or Hispanic infants than white infants. Meaning, even though rates of preterm birth were higher among blacks and Hispanics at particular hospital locations, these infants continued to be cared for in hospitals with lower quality of care, which are also the hospitals in the higher morbidity and mortality quartile. Both studies concluded that black and Hispanic (ie, nonwhite) infants had higher rates of severe mor-bidities and more likely to be born in poorer-performing hospitals.1,2 Interestingly, researchers remain unsure as to why moms in disadvantage populations continue to deliver at these hospitals when distance or access to health care has not been shown to explain choice for birth hospital. Neither of the studies we have discussed directly measured implicit bias. However, research has demonstrated that implicit and/or unintentional bias is linked to quality of care and informs hospital performance and patient outcomes.5 This suggests that by addressing implicit biases, a modifiable characteristic, it is likely to have a significant impact on reducing the racial and ethnic disparity gap and improve morality. Several studies have shown that if outcomes are improved in low-performing hospitals, there is a significant narrowing of disparities.6,7 Thus, improvements to processes rather than outcomes, such as providing culturally competent care, could be effective in closing the quality of care gap, regardless of social risk. Neonatal providers need to be intentional about how identified racial disparities are visible in their own unit and address biases by confronting them. If we continue to pretend as though care is impartial, it will perpetuate the racial and health disparities impacting outcomes for our tiniest and sickest patients. It is important to begin having open conversations with our coworkers about implicit biases—even if it is uncomfortable. Our own personal discomfort with these issues is the least of what many vulnerable populations have experienced their entire lives. It is time for providers to recognize the truth that racial and health disparities do exist in neonatal care and our implicit biases are impacting neonatal outcomes. Ashlee J.

    "abstract": "Infectious diseases can result in devastating morbidities and mortality on the developing fetus and neonate, highlighting the importance of prevention, screening, early recognition, and treatment. A subset of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP) works to reduce the incidence, morbidity, mortality, and health disparities related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), viral hepatitis, sexually transmitted diseases, and tuberculosis (TB) for individuals of every age. The NCHHSTP performs public health surveillance, funds prevention research, and supports programs to prevent and control infectious diseases.1 One of the strategic aims of the NCHHSTP is to prevent infectious disease through healthcare.2 In addition, the importance of healthy development of the child is one of the basic principles in the constitution of the World Health Organization.3 Aligned with the goals set forth by the NCHHSTP and the World Health Organization, this special 2-part series focuses on the definitions, incidence, pathophysiology, prevention, and management of various congenital infectious diseases. Many infectious diseases are routinely screened for during pregnancy, while others are not. Hepatitis B, rubella, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are some of the common infectious diseases screened for during pregnancy and are the focus of a review article on maternal titers and serologies. Two additional infectious diseases that are commonly screened for, HIV and congenital syphilis (CS), will be explored in depth in additional, separate articles. Prenatal screening provides important information to both obstetric and neonatal healthcare providers to improve neonatal outcomes associated with congenital infectious diseases; however, not all infectious diseases are screened for during pregnancy. In addition, not all pregnant women receive prenatal care, and, therefore, prenatal screening for infectious disease. This makes familiarity with various infectious disease symptomatologies important for all neonatal providers. TB and Zika virus are not routinely screened for during pregnancy, and therefore, deserve our special attention to raise awareness, as many neonatal providers will not be familiar with the symptomology associated with these diseases. TB and Zika virus will be presented in separate articles in this special 2-part series on congenital infectious disease. According to the CDC, 1 in 7 people living with HIV are unaware of their positive status.4 Globally, HIV and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) killed 1 million people in 2016.5 Neonates born to nontreated, HIV-positive mothers have a 25% chance of contracting HIV themselves.6,7 In comparison, a much lower rate of transmission occurs (0.2%-2.2%) when antiretroviral treatment begins before or during pregnancy.8,9 These facts highlight the importance of HIV screening prior to and during pregnancy. A review on congenital HIV is offered in this series. Congenital syphilis commands our attention as well, due to the recent overall increase in syphilis in the United States by 38% during the years of 2012-2014.2 In 2014, there were 11.6 cases of CS per 100,000 live births.2 Lack of prenatal care has been implicated in this spike. Syphilis remains a global problem as well, with nearly 1 million pregnant women infected each year.10 CS may result in fetal loss, stillbirth, neonatal death, low birth weight, and infections.10 Screening and treatment with penicillin during pregnancy can alleviate the morbidity and mortality associated with CS. A review of CS with a corresponding case study is presented. I recently gave a talk at a state neonatal conference regarding congenital TB. I was met with black stares when I asked the audience if they had ever worked up or treated a neonate for congenital TB. Although the overall rate of TB is decreasing in the United States and worldwide, pregnant cases in the United States are actually increasing.11 TB remains in the top 10 list for causes of death globally.5 These statistics, along with recent immigration patterns, make congenital TB a diagnosis that should be considered in certain scenarios in the neonatal intensive care unit. Congenital TB can have devastating effects, including mortality, on the neonate, especially when not promptly diagnosed. An overview of congenital TB is presented to raise awareness of this potential new threat to the neonatal intensive care unit. The Zika virus is a relatively new threat to neonates in this country and has received much press of late. The virus is more common in Africa, the Americas, Asia, and the Pacific; as such, pregnant women are not advised to travel to Zika-endemic areas.13 Congenital Zika syndrome is linked to severe microcephaly, decreased brain tissue, scarring and pigment changes to the back of the eye, limited range of motion, and hypertonicity.14 There is currently no vaccine or treatment for Zika.13 A review article of Zika is offered in addition to a patient education supplement for the clinician. This special 2-part series on congenital infectious disease offers a comprehensive review on maternal titers and serologies offered during routine prenatal screening and focuses on congenital syndromes associated with HIV, syphilis, TB, and Zika virus. As neonatal providers we have a responsibility to collaborate with obstetric providers and infectious disease specialists to provide the best quality care and outcomes for our tiny patients through education, prevention, screening, early recognition, and treatment (when available).",

    "abstract": "Dear NANN Colleagues, We begin by thanking you for your readership of Advances in Neonatal Care (ANC). As Co-Editors-in-Chief we have been able to do so much with your support. As we begin to consider 2020, we see many new opportunities and challenges for the future of our journal. Below we describe a few issues we want you to be aware of as we move forward. OPEN ACCESS IN PUBLISHING The publication world in general seems a bit turbulent right now. There are several changes being considered both in Europe and around the world that could impact how scholarly work is published. There is a big push for all scholarly work to be “Free Access” and thus, freely available to all (not just to scholars through subscriptions but to the general public). This may sound like a great idea, but behind this push is the wicked question: Who will pay for this availability? There is a cost for production of manuscripts into articles that clinicians and researchers will want to read and use to guide their work. In addition, if publication of scholarly work were freely available to all in an electronic format, library subscriptions and journal subscriptions would become unneeded and revenue from those channels would significantly decrease while at the same time the cost of production is somewhat stable creating a funding mismatch. Currently, for “Open Access” to occur there is a fee to the author for requesting this publication type. Open access fee covers the cost of the publication process and allows the work to then be made freely available to others who do not have an institutional or personal subscription to the journal. The National Institute of Health (NIH) already requires this access for works that are published out of research supported by NIH at no cost to the authors. In Europe, the process is a little different and it seems their national funding agencies may be pushing for publication through their own process (possibly their own journals) if the work has been funded through a European funder. Currently, this topic is just a discussion and there is no way to know how this will turn out, so we are just keeping an eye on the process along with our own publisher, Lippincott. We don't expect a change in the publication process in the very near future but change as you know is always looming and sometimes change moves fast and sometimes slow, so we are trying to be abreast of the proposed changes and how they could impact ANC. Stay tuned for this one. ANC RESPONSE TIME AND REVIEW PROCESSES We have noticed that turnaround times for ANC manuscripts have been increasing. We wanted you to know that we are as concerned about this issue as you are. There are several contributing factors. As has always been the case, we have many first-time and junior authors with increasing needs for editorial support that slows down the process. We want to support and mentor junior authors while still keeping manuscripts moving through the publication process. We have noticed that even though we have decreased the number of peer reviewers from 3 to 3 in the last year the review time has not decreased. We also notice that it takes longer to get 2 reviewers to agree to review than it has in the past and this increases review times. We will briefly outline the submission process to demonstrate where hang-ups occur in the process. Once the manuscript is fully submitted (all required aspects) the clock begins. The first item that can cause a slowdown in the process is getting all authors to sign the authorship documents; this alone can take 1 to 2 weeks. You can help us with this issue by making sure all the manuscript authors know you have completed submission of the manuscript and that they will receive an e-mail from the journal that they must reply to for the manuscript to move forward in the process. Once approved by all authors, the manuscript moves on to one of the co-editors for peer review assignments. This step involves a few different processes. First the Co-Editor briefly reviews the manuscript and all other attachments for clarity and “fit” for ANC. We also exam the manuscript through a software for plagiarism and if there are problems, we might send the manuscript back to the authors without further review. If we decide to move forward, then we will choose 2 peer-reviewers based on the “personal classifications” each peer-reviewer provides with registration in editorial manager. We also might choose peer-reviewers from our editorial board or known experts whom have an ANC editorial manager account. Peer-reviewers have 72 hours to accept/decline these assignments before the system will help us to choose another peer-reviewer. We have noticed that peer-reviewers often don't accept until they get a second notice and then could take the full 14 days to review the manuscript. There are also times where peer-reviewers have accepted the assignment but then take more than 14 days to submit their reviews, adding to delays. Once 2 peer-reviews are completed, the co-editors again review the manuscript and peer reviews and assigns the manuscripts to the appropriate section editor for review. Although this step could delay the process by increasing the number of handoffs of the manuscript, we believe this step provides the authors the best-targeted feedback for the specific journal section. This feedback can decrease the numbers of revisions necessary for an acceptable manuscript. Together, we all play a part in the review process. Hopefully, understanding the process will help you to be more aware of meeting the deadlines. If you are an author and you have questions about your manuscript, please do not hesitate to contact us. The first contact should be Emily Babcock our Managing Editor; she can be best contacted at [email protected]. She will often answer your questions faster than if you try to contact one of the Co-Editors. She also understands how best to get around in ANC Editorial Manager than either of the Co-Editors. If you would like mentorship for your manuscript, please let us know and we will facilitate a writing mentor for you. Oftentimes we can solicit someone on the editorial board to help you with getting your work to be publishable quality. MANUSCRIPT PAGE LENGTHS We have always included a manuscript page length in our author guidelines; however, it is only recently that we are enforcing these page length guidelines. For most manuscripts submitted to ANC, the manuscript should be less than 15 pages of text (not including the title page, abstract, and references). The only exception is systematic reviews or meta-analyses manuscripts. For these submissions we will allow up to 18 pages. We are now checking the page lengths and asking authors to revise manuscripts that are longer. We are enforcing these requirements for 2 reasons: (1) we are receiving more excellent submission and we want to be able to share as many as possible with you in a timely way; and, (2) we are beginning to have a backlog of more than 3 issues (approximately 6-8 months' delay in printing of manuscripts accepted for publication). Most manuscripts go to “publication ahead of print” and thus, these are available online before printing in a journal issue. These page length requirements do not include tables or graphs; however, we would prefer you keep your total tables and figures to 6 to 8 or less. If you would like to share more tables, figures, and graphs with readers, supplemental digital content is an option. SUPPLEMENTAL DIGITAL CONTENT Sometimes you might choose to publish some aspects of your manuscript as supplemental digital content. These additional materials can be shared with readers in a digital format online that is hyperlinked to the article once it is in print. Long tables such as those in a systematic review, or a large table that could be a questionnaire or protocol, might be something you would choose to share with readers in this way, as a means, to keep your print content within the required page counts. One very important thing to remember is that supplemental digital content is not formatted by the publisher. And thus, it would be important to submit this content in a print quality format. What we mean by this is to make sure there are no grammar or punctuation issues, and that you use spacing, color, and graphics to accentuate the work. Exactly what you submit is what the readers will see when they download this content. Please see our author guidelines for more details. Once again, thank you for your loyal readership and submissions to Advances in Neonatal Care—we look forward to entering the next decade of excellence with you! Jacqueline M.

    "abstract": "REIKI IN THE NICU FOR OPIOID WITHDRAW? As more Americans are succumbing to opioid abuse, neonates are innocently being affected from those pregnant opioid users. Although this is not a new phenomenan1 in history, it is estimated that today there are over 2 million people with an opioid addiction in the United States.2 Regardless of gestational age beyond viability, many of these neonates end up being cared for in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) due to the withdrawal period postdelivery from regular fetal opioid exposure called neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS).3,4 Assessments of neonates with NAS have been measured using several different NAS tools over time, with the Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring System getting most use.3,5 NAS symptoms include, but are not limited to, uncoordinated feeding patterns, vomiting, diarrhea, high-pitched crying, and irritability.3 In premature infants born to opioid-addicted mothers, the risk for more frequent intermittent hypoxemia is present compared with the baseline intermittent hypoxemia common among most premature infants.6 NAS admissions have increased significantly over the last decade, which has increased length of stay and medical interventions.7 Neonatal nurses will need to continue expanding their thoughts and tools to assist in caring for this growing patient population. One nonpharmacologic option recently researched in this patient population is the use of Reiki therapy.8 Reiki therapy is considered complementary or an alternative medicine that uses the person's own healing energy guided by a Reiki practitioner to restore the body and/or restore balance within the person.9 Thirty opioid-exposed infants underwent a 30-minute Reiki therapy session with vital signs monitored to ensure the neonate was not overstimulated. Analyses showed performing Reiki in a NAS group of neonates did not pose any adverse events and, in fact, may have caused relaxation as noted by a slight decrease in heart rate during the session.8 Although the sample size was small and much more research is needed to determine further benefit, Reiki may be a viable nonpharmacologic intervention to opioid-exposed neonates with NAS. FETAL MRIs FOR CONGENITAL ANOMALIES Fetal ultrasounds have become the main imaging go-to for over the last several decades. Fetal interventions and close management of fetal anomalies have evolved, with some radiologists questioning more utility of fetal MRI.10 Fetal MRI could allow not only for detecting the presence of a physical malformation like ultrasound, but it would take the level of information to the next level. For example, in the situation of a fetus having a congenital diaphragmatic hernia, ultrasound would be sufficient to determine its presence; however, fetal MRI would be able to detect which organs were involved.11 As medicine becomes more sophisticated and decisions are made prior to delivery, the use of fetal MRIs may become more frequent and more commonly accepted. Fetal MRI might be an added layer of imagining that will provide needed information, in very specific cases, that will outweigh the risk involved with the procedure. LARYNGEAL, BAG AND MASK, OR ENDOTRACHEAL TUBE Positive-pressure ventilation is occasionally needed for infants shortly after birth or during their stay in the NICU. Recently, a Cochrane Review published information covering 7 different studies that enrolled nearly 800 infants and compared laryngeal, bag and mask, and endotracheal tube delivery.12 Although often not as frequently utilized, laryngeal mask ventilation was measured as equivalent, if not more effective, compared with bag and mask ventilation and endotracheal ventilation. In the case of failed intubation, laryngeal mask ventilation was a second best option. Evidence to support, these claims were researched primarily in infants 34 weeks' gestation and older and greater than 1500 g. Therefore, making these conclusions for infants less than 34 weeks and less than 1500 g may be imprecise. In summary, laryngeal, bag and mask, and endotracheal tube ventilation are all viable options and choosing the best method may be based upon on situation at hand.",

    "abstract": "NEWBORN SCREENING Heather E. Smith, PhD, RN, NNP-BC, CNS Newborn screening is one of the largest and most successful1 public health initiatives2 and a required test performed on newborns in the United States. This test is the familiar 5 circles requiring blood on filter paper within the first 48 hours of life and then again, closer to discharge, for those infants cared for in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The goal for conducting this test is to identify inheritable disorders early in life to lessen and prevent future sequelae including death.3 The history of this test goes back to the 1960s with the first test assessing for phenylketonuria.3 In nearly 60 years, those eligible for screening would equate to approximately 220 million people in the United States (using 4 million births per year4) with an estimated 5000 infants with a positive finding each year.2 Early detection provides the opportunity at a nominal price ($15 to $150/per test)5 to proactively identify and treat infants before symptoms present, which in turn should decrease an infant's chance of morbidity and mortality and increase their possibility of better life quality for the infant and family. Progress to a uniform national newborn screening list has been slow. However, the last decade has shown great advances. The selected disorder chosen for testing is state specific even though the state test is federally funded, and several national groups provide guidance for establishing standards.3 One of the major groups is the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG). The ACMG developed the Recommended Universal Screening Panel in 20053 and continues to update the recommended list that now includes 35 conditions and 26 secondary conditions.5 New legislature called Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act was established in 2008 and allowed for the creation of the Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children to inform the Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary regarding newborn screening. This legislature creates formal communication to the HHS Secretary for making informed decisions about project funding, establishing testing priorities, and state funding for enhancing states' screening panel, parent education, and continued newborn screening laboratory standards.6 Programs covered by this act will expire at the end of September 2019 without a renewal by Congress. Do you believe newborn screening is important? Have you seen a child and family benefit from early screening? If you would like to continue support for newborn screening, there is something you can do—write to your member of Congress. You can go down the traditional route of pen and paper or go online. If you need some assistance, the Everylife Foundation has made voicing your support to your Congress member easy.

ACTIVE NEONATAL DRUG STUDY There is a very short list of drugs approved for neonatal use by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA).7 Having a company dedicated to neonatal studies with a new drug in the pipeline specifically created for neonates is exciting and rare. The company is called Infant Bacterial Therapeutics (IBT) and they have been working on a new drug they call IBP-9414 for the prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).8 IBP-9414 is using the live bacterial strain Lactobacillus reuteri found in human milk to study its impact on reducing the occurrence of NEC in infants born before 32 weeks' gestation9 who are at the most risk for NEC. For a drug to receive FDA approval, an investigational new drug process is required to show various phases (phases I-III) or studies of safety and efficacy data including randomization for the FDA to offer market approval.10 In 2017, IBP-9414 was used in a phase II study at many US NICUs and the results showed IBP-9414 to be well-tolerated and safe. In July 2019, the first subject was enrolled into the phase III study known as the Connection Study. The purpose of the Connection Study is to show that randomized neonates to IBP-9414 have less prevalence of NEC than those neonates given placebo. This study is being conducted internationally and expected to enroll over 2000 infants. If enrollment and outcomes go as expected, IBT expects to submit the data to the FDA in 2021 for FDA market approval.8 NEW GBS TREATMENT GUIDELINES The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in conjunction with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has recently published new guidance for treating group B streptococcal (GBS) infection.11 These new guidelines will replace the last consensus guidelines in 2010. These new guidelines are consistent with recent AAP bacterial causes of early-onset sepsis recommendations and also include how to best manage late-onset GBS and treatment for both early and late-onset GBS. The new recommendations focus on (1) the assessment of early-onset GBS for those greater than and less than 35 weeks' gestation separately, (2) acceptable intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) can be accomplished with penicillin G, ampicillin, or cefazolin for early-onset GBS, but not for clindamycin and vancomycin, (3) blood and cerebrospinal fluid culture are the only 2 laboratory tests to confirm early-onset GBS and that a late-onset GBS diagnosis must have a positive culture from a typically sterile site, and (4) antibiotic treatment will vary based on the infant's postnatal age. To read more details about the new neonatal GBS treatment guidance go to https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2019/07/04/peds.2019-1881. If you are interested in understanding ACOG's changes for IAP, notes from the committee's meetings can be found separately online.12",

    "abstract": "THE 21ST-CENTURY CHALLENGES TO THE DEVELOPING BRAIN Wakako Minamoto Eklund, DNP, APRN, NNP-BC Neonatal nurses are committed to providing developmentally sensitive care with gentle and nurturing experience to neonates whose brains are undergoing rapid growth. Multiple approaches and programs have been introduced and studied1–3 to create an environment where cortical development, connections of synapses, and myelination of every neuron can continue following the in utero trajectory. Neonatal nurses not only care for developmentally challenged preterm infants; they also care for not so preterm infants who are challenged with behavioral symptoms related to prenatal substance exposure. One of the substances that is increasingly a frequent finding within the maternal drug screen is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC is the principal psychoactive element of cannabis, also known as marijuana that has been increasingly legalized in the United States for not only medical use, but for recreational use.4 On August 29, 2019, the office of the US Surgeon General issued an Advisory on Marijuana Use and the Developing Brain emphasizing the importance of “Protecting the Nation from the health risks of Marijuana use in adolescence and during pregnancy ...”4 Marijuana, the most frequently used illicit substance in the United States, impacts the brain by binding to the cannabinoid receptors inducing euphoria, or cognitive/motor impairment, and, with higher doses or long time use, a link to mental illness including schizophrenia is reported.5 This federal advisory generally reflects the recommendations issued earlier in 2015, 2017, and 2018 by the American College of Obstetrician and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)6,7; however, it notably does not recommend against marijuana risk in lactation. It does recommend “No one should smoke Marijuana or tobacco around a baby.” The same cannabinoid system/receptors that lead to desired symptoms for adults who use marijuana also impact the fetal cortical development that later impacts mood, and ability to make decisions or coping.8 The cannabinoid system plays a key role again during adolescence when neural connections undergo refinement, as the brain progresses from adolescence to young adults.9 The National Survey on Drug Use and Health indicates that increased use of marijuana among the general public is significant. Marijuana use among those 12 years and older increased from 6.2% in 2002 to 8.9% in 2016.10 For young adults 18-25 years old, 1 in every 5 (20.8%) indicated the use of marijuana within the last month, showing the highest since 2002.10 Thus, the reported bifold increase of marijuana use among pregnant mothers between 2002 and 2017 (3.4%-7%) may be underestimated today.11 Newnam12 pointed out, in the August issue of Advances in Neonatal Care in 2018, that the problem of increasing cannabis use is likely to progress due to the increased cannabis legalization in multiple states. The increased encounter with infants with in utero exposure to THC translates as a significant public health reality requiring vigilance and heightened need for well-informed healthcare professionals equipped with accurate information to support infants and families. The ACOG had published recommendations in 2017 by updating the earlier 2015 recommendations.6 By accessing the following link, the readers can examine the evidence illuminating the increasing health threat of maternal use of marijuana to neonatal population: https://www.acog.org/Clinical-Guidance-and-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Obstetric-Practice/Marijuana-Use-During-Pregnancy-and-Lactation?IsMobileSet=false. Concerns for negative pregnancy outcomes, such as low birth weight, preterm births, or stillbirths, are included. The report updates that current evidence does not demonstrate the perinatal marijuana exposure to perinatal mortality; however, it indicates an increased risk of stillbirth (relative risk 1.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-2.93). Frequent use of marijuana was associated with an increased risk for small-for-gestational births (6.7% vs 11.2%; 95% CI, 1.44-2.45). The report also maintained the earlier findings of smaller head circumference associated with marijuana exposure, which were more prominent with first- and second-trimester exposure. The recommendations published late 2018 by the AAP Committee on Substance Use and Prevention, Section on Breast Feeding, addresses more specifically regarding the marijuana use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.7 Prenatal use of marijuana can affect the fetal cortical development13 as well as the maternal placental function.14,15 Mean lower birth weights, lower Apgar scores, and increased risk for stillbirth are also reported.16 THC is also a lipid-soluble substance with a low molecular weight, which transfers easily to human milk. The full report is available at https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/142/3/e20181889.full.pdf. The report does describe the challenges in identifying the specific effects of THC, since most marijuana users are not using marijuana alone, confounding the results. However, polysubstance exposure is the actual reality seen frequently in today's environment making the findings quite valuable and relevant. The 10 evidence-based recommendations made available in this guideline are useful for nursing professionals who work with pregnant mothers or their newborns. A few of the most practical recommendations include the following points: Marijuana should not be used during pregnancy, and when using medical marijuana for conditions such nausea and vomiting, consider alternative treatments. The use of marijuana during pregnancy in states where marijuana is legal does not exempt a mother from potential investigation for having positive results due to the priority placed on the child's welfare. Testing is done to offer options for maternal treatment. Mothers are encouraged not to use marijuana while breastfeeding and mothers need to be informed of potential impact of THC on the rapidly growing brain. Pediatricians are urged to work with local or state agencies to advocate for policies to protect infants and families. The last recommendations address pediatricians, but this advocacy effort is also highly relevant to neonatal nursing professionals. We are caregivers, nurturers, educators, but also advocates for the infants and their families. We encourage you to be vigilant and knowledgeable about the health risks of marijuana and current recommendations. Additional reports from legalized states are likely going to become increasingly available. A report published last year from Colorado revealed that marijuana use was associated with 50% increased likelihood for low birth weight (odds ratio, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.1) independent of maternal age, race, level of education, or prenatal tobacco.17 The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment offers various resources designed in response to marijuana legalization (https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdphe/marijuana-clinical-guidelines). Some information is offered in multiple languages and highly useful. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention website provides information in a friendly and easy-to-access format (https://www.cdc.gov/marijuana/index.htm). Please share these resources. Today, general public is gaining the perception that marijuana is OK due to the widespread legalization for both medical and recreational use. It is not OK for infants.",

    "abstract": "POWER OF STORIES TO HIGHLIGHT THE COMPLEX ISSUES SURROUNDING BRONCHOPULMONARY DYSPLASIA Wakako Minamoto Eklund, DNP, NNP-BC No neonatal nurse can spend even a month in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) without caring for infants who are at risk for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The risk of BPD in the early 1990s may be different from that of today; however, neonatal nurses understand the devastating course that extremely premature infants may take and the excruciating adjustments for families who take an infant home with pulmonary fragility. This brief provides a current understanding of BPD and how BPD incidence and concept of BPD have changed overtime. Caregiving trends for clinicians, researchers, as well as regulatory bodies are provided to increase understanding about what BPD is, what is required to advance the outcomes related to BPD, and what patients' experiences are with BPD infants today. THE POWER OF STORIES Three powerful stories told by mothers of former premature infants who survived NICU with lung disease recently appeared in the Journal of Pediatrics.1 The 3 mothers, Deb Discenza, Jennifer Degl, and Keira Sorrells, who are all members of the Preemie Parent Alliance,2 which is a dynamic network of mostly former NICU parents, are the courageous storytellers. The 3 mothers describe their raw experience of living with BPD with passionate words that demonstrate the deepest of love for their sick children who require complex daily care, some who were tragically overcome by the complications. The stories touch our human souls in a way to propel us to a desire for a deeper understanding of the needs and to recognize families' challenges with the warmest empathy during the NICU journey. THE STORIES COMPLEMENT THE STUDY RESULTS The stories were published to add tangible dimensions to a study also published in the same issue of the Journal of Pediatrics by Brady and colleagues,3 titled “Living With Severe Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia—Parental Views of Their Child's Quality of Life.” Brady and colleagues report the findings from a study of infants born before 32 weeks' gestational age (GA) with BPD who survived beyond 18 to 36 months corrected age. The researchers studied the parental views of the children's health-related quality of life (QOL), specifically physical and psychosocial QOL, and the relationship with the neonatal morbidities associated with BPD. The 3 mothers' stories add additional layers to the Brady and colleagues study results regarding the children's QOL and how BPD had impacted every area of their family life. Both of these articles are available at https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(18)31718-9/fulltext and https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(18)31412-4/fulltext. Both physical and psychosocial QOL scores were significantly lower for parents with children suffering from BPD than for the term or other preterm infants. Although we do not often continue to care for these infants and their families beyond NICU discharge, knowing the results of this study may allow deeper compassion and empathy in preparing families during the NICU journey. HISTORY OF BPD Some NICU caregivers today do not know the era before high-flow nasal cannula or continuous positive airway pressure devices were developed; however, some of the readers have been caring for babies since the time before surfactant was available. BPD was first described as pulmonary disease of premature infants who required the use of oxygen at 28 days of life by Northway and colleagues4 in 1967. However, the participants in this study were not the extremely low birth-weight infants (ELBWs) who weigh less than 1000 g at birth seen in the NICUs today. The BPD description by Northway and colleagues was mostly of premature infants older than 32 weeks' GA. Since the advent of artificial surfactant in the 1980s,5 infants who would have otherwise not survived without surfactant have survived, thereby increasing the incidence of infants who develop pulmonary morbidities. One study published in 1992 reported more than trifold increase in the incidence of BPD from 1980 (10.6%) to 1990 (32.9%) among infants born weighing less than 1500 g with a concurrent decrease in neonatal deaths from 26.4% to 15.9% during the same period.6 In the new era of advanced fertility treatments and refined neonatal care with limits of viability being pushed back, survival of significantly premature infants at risk for BPD became a more frequent occurrence.7 It is of note that the physiology and etiology of BPD described by Northway and colleagues and what we see in ELBW infants who are born at much earlier gestations are not identical, due primarily to the stages of lung development that are interrupted by much earlier gestation. Increased survival is a welcome news and, in fact, it reflects an amazing advance in neonatal care; however, survival with significant morbidities and its negative impact on individual families cannot be underestimated as seen in the mothers' stories noted earlier.1 BPD indeed saw a decline. In 2010, a large nationwide population study8 that examined 9,542,032 neonatal admissions found an annual decrease of 4.3% in BPD from 1993 to 2006 (P= .002). Yet, another study9 of 9575 infants (22-28 weeks' GA) by the National Institutes of Health–Neonatal Research Network published in the same year did not report an overall decrease in BPD incidence. However, when analyzed according to severity, incidence of severe BPD declined from 2003 to 2007.9 BPD is the most common complication of premature births, with known predictors being decreasing GA and receiving mechanical ventilation on day of life 7.10,11 Many changes in obstetric and neonatal practices occurred over the years, changing the face of respiratory care with increasing noninvasive respiratory management approaches with general decreases in more invasive ventilation.7 With the known predictor of BPD as a decreasing GA or an invasive respiratory care needs early in life, the best method to decrease BPD, therefore, is to prevent preterm births. However, BPD has not disappeared in 2019, and BPD still overpowers infants today, as witnessed by all neonatal care providers. Effort to reduce BPD is continuing globally in 2019, 52 years after Northway and colleagues4 first described BPD.12 BPD is a challenge not only for the NICU professionals and families involved but also for clinical researchers, the industry partners, and regulatory bodies that are committed to developing new therapies to improve BPD outcomes. CHALLENGES RELATED TO BPD RESEARCH Since the development of surfactant and antenatal steroids, no newer therapies have made a significant impact on BPD.13 Efforts are still being made globally to enhance treatment options; however, BPD research is faced with significant issues due to lack of consensus related to the definitions14 as well as endpoints12 to build robust clinical studies. Numerous attempts have been made to define BPD that correlates with the actual pulmonary morbidities later in life,14 which is referred to by “chronic pulmonary insufficiency of prematurity.”12 Uniform agreement in defining BPD is needed to better understand which infants must have BPD diagnosis at the end of NICU journey (to observe any reduction later as a result of any research intervention). A simple example demonstrating the confusion related to the definition is described by Steinhorn et al.12 Some infants on 4 L/min high-flow nasal cannula at 36 weeks' corrected age are actually not viewed as having BPD due to no need for supplemental O2, while infants receiving 0.1 L/min at 100% O2 would be classified as having BPD. Consensus is also necessary to consider endpoints, or the time at which various outcomes are measured in any studies. The endpoints must be meaningful not only to the researchers but also to the families. Some endpoints are described as short term and some are long term.12 If the endpoint is too far out, the research studies may risk losing the enrolled patients and the cost of the follow-up may increase. Long-term endpoints, however, may better capture the meaningful outcome to patients and families. Short-term endpoints may be highly valuable in certain types of interventions that are being studied. Without well-thought-out definitions and endpoints, inaccurate data may be obtained, leading to inaccurate conclusions. New therapy that may have been truly effective and safe may be found to be ineffective due to the suboptimal endpoints or definitions that skew the analysis and results. The challenge in enrolling a sufficient number of neonates in any single study emphasizes the value of meta-analyses that offer more generalizable results. Ununified definitions or the endpoints among the studies make this process highly difficult. Numerous Food and Drug Administration (FDA) members, other regulatory members from abroad, global researchers, clinicians, and industry partners who are committed to promote respiratory innovation gathered in Washington, District of Columbia, in October 2018 at the Duke-FDA Workshop on Endpoint Development for Preterm Neonates With Pulmonary Morbidities and discussed the urgent need to redefine important elements needed to promote further global research to decrease pulmonary morbidities. One of the high points of the discussion included the recommendation that BPD defined as “supplemental oxygen use at 36-week postmenstrual age” be changed to possibly 40 week since the current BPD definition is not known to be truly predictive of later pulmonary morbidities.15 Every NICU nurse contributes as a member of NICU team to improve both the short- and long-term pulmonary outcomes of the premature infants we take care of, and care of infants with BPD is inescapable. The National Association of Neonatal Nurses (NANN) also attended this meeting to represent the nursing voice in this matter and to support the voice of the parents. The 3 mothers who published their stories in the Journal of Pediatrics1 were also in attendance and shared their experiences to educate FDA members and other researchers about what is meaningful and what their life is like to live with BPD. Take a deep breath while you take care of the babies in your NICU. Reading the articles discussed earlier will provide some insight into the lives of the babies we take care of through the eyes of their dedicated mothers who are our partners during their NICU journey.",

DESIGN Longitudinal, correlational study based on the Resiliency Model of Family Stress, Adjustment and Adaptation. SAMPLE Data were collected, through mailed questionnaires, from 71 couples, 18 to 24 months following the birth of their infant. The data are a follow-up from a previous study conducted at the time of the infant's birth. MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLES The dependent variable in the study was family adjustment, measured by the McMaster Family Assessment Device. The independent variables were family resources, as measured by the Family Inventory of Resource Management; family coping, as measured by the Family Crisis Oriented Evaluation Scales; family strain, as measured by the Family Inventory of Life Events and Changes; and parent gender, family system (first-time parent or not), and the child's health, as measured by the Demographic Information Questionnaire. RESULTS Family adjustment improved over time for mothers but decreased for fathers. Fathers of infants with ongoing health problems reported significantly poorer family adjustment. Family resources were related to family adjustment and decreased over time for both parents. Families used more coping mechanisms and different coping patterns over time.",

The differences between large teaching hospital NICUs and smaller community hospital units are highlighted.

    "abstract": "This case report describes a 27-week, 1040-g infant, whose mother presented with an acute abruption and fetal distress prompting emergency cesarean birth. The birth was further complicated by fetal malposition, manual version, birth trauma, and perinatal depression requiring intubation, ventilation, and chest compressions. On day of life (DOL) 7, the infant suddenly deteriorated with cardiovascular collapse and severe coagulopathy. Coexisting spontaneous bowel perforation (SBP) and ruptured subcapsular liver hematoma (SLH) were confirmed operatively. Although survival with ruptured SLH is rarely reported, with aggressive medical and surgical management, this infant survived and was discharged home at 43 weeks postconceptual age. SBP may occur silently; pneumoperitoneum may be an incidental finding. Conversely, rupture of an SLH typically presents with a sudden clinical deterioration. The common predisposing factor for both conditions is low birth weight (LBW). A review of the known and proposed risk factors, clinical signs and symptoms, pathophysiology, and treatment of both SBP and SLH are provided. A literature review highlighting the potential impact of drug exposures (indomethacin, hydrocortisone, and low molecular weight heparin) is provided, along with a discussion of the implications for clinical practice and research.",

    "abstract": "POINT-OF-CARE TESTING We have all been at the bedside of an infant, critically ill and deteriorating. Some of us remember the days where we would draw laboratory results or obtain radiographs and wait hours, not minutes, for critical results. Gone are the days we stood at the bedside wringing our hands in frustration, waiting for the information to aid our clinical decision-making. Today, we have x-ray machines that show images while we wait, improved monitoring equipment that provides continuous physiology monitoring of our patients, and point-of-care laboratory testing that produce data in minutes, not hours. Multiple tests are conducted at the bedside in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). We depend on point-of-care testing for immediate results that have shown improvement in our patient care outcomes.1 Most of these testing methods are not new to bedside care providers. Common examples include serum electrolytes, lactate levels, hemoglobin/hematocrit, ionized calcium, blood gas analysis, glucose, hemocult, and gastric Ph. In addition to point-of-care testing, most NICUs are supported by 24-hour ancillary services such as radiology, laboratory, and blood banks. The access to needed information and intervention supports our ability to provide neonatal care. Not everyone practices in this world. When you are in a rural location or radiology is delayed, there may be a need to reach for the newest member of the point-of-care family, bedside ultrasonography. Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) is most commonly used in the NICU to diagnose pneumothorax, which occurs in approximately 9.2% of extremely low birth-weight infants.1 Although this diagnosis can be made clinically through auscultation and/or transillumination, there is a margin of error in the smallest of infants. Increased morbidity and mortality have been linked to treatment delay. Ultrasonography has demonstrated a high level of accuracy in detecting pneumothorax, reducing time of diagnosis and treatment.1 This technology is not new to the adult world but has recently gained attention in pediatric and neonatal units.2 Some of us are familiar with ultrasound technology use during percutaneous peripheral central catheter placement.3 In the pediatric intensive care units and emergency departments, this technology has been used to successfully identify the correct needle placement for a lumbar puncture and/or drainage of pleural effusions.4,5 Can you imagine this technology in the delivery room during resuscitation of an infant who requires urgent drainage of bilateral plural effusions? Common barriers to POCUS in the NICU have been identified. These include equipment cost, training, and maintaining proficient users within the unit personnel. Although still debated, the most realistic training method for POCUS occurs during neonatal nurse practitioner and fellowship programs, with neonatologists and/or radiologists directing ongoing training. Proficiency would be maintained similar to other neonatal procedures, utilizing simulation or skills laboratories. It has been suggested that neonatologists who were once trained with transillumination are retiring and the new generation of neonatal providers are supportive of learning and teaching the most reliable method of diagnosis. In the future, we may be supplying central POCUS equipment on the code cart instead of transilluminators. HOT OFF THE PRESS: HEPATITIS B IMMUNOPROPHYLAXIS RECOMMENDATIONS The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has just released the “Updated Recommendations for Hepatitis B Virus Infection Prevention for Neonatal Patients.”1 These recommendations include: Universal hepatitis B vaccination within 24 hours of birth for medically stable infants weighing 2000 g or more. Testing hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive pregnant women for hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid (HBV DNA). Postvaccination serologic testing for those infants whose mothers' HBsAg status remains unknown. Single-dose revaccination for infants born to HBsAg-positive women not responding to the initial vaccine series. Removal of permissive language for delaying the birth dose until after hospital discharge (this recommendation has the greatest impact on those working in level I/level II nurseries). The ACIP recommendations mirror the most recent American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) policy statement, which states, “The first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine should be given within the first 24 hours of life.”2 The AAP reported 1000 new cases of perinatal hepatitis B infection annually in the United States.2 Neonates who contract hepatitis B at birth or during the first year of life have a 90% risk to develop chronic hepatitis B.2 Immunoprophylaxis following perinatal transmission has implications for care delivery in nurseries and the NICU. The AAP and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend “administration of appropriate post exposure immunoprophylaxis with hepatitis B vaccine and immune globulin as a method of transmission prevention.”2,3 Prevention of perinatal hepatitis B relies on the proper and timely identification of infants born to mothers who are HBsAg positive and/or those mothers with unknown hepatitis B status.3 The newest AAP recommendations, which were published in September 2017,2 align with the ACIP recommendations listed earlier.1 The change to neonatal practice specifically surrounds the “removal of permissive language for delaying the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine and, for all medically stable infants weighing greater than or equal to 2,000 grams.”1,2 No longer should we wait until the first pediatric visit following hospital discharge. In addition, the AAP endorses the recommendation for giving the birth vaccine within the first 24 hours of life to further reduce the incidence of perinatal hepatitis B transmission.2 These recommendations will likely alter the conversations we have with our parents during postdelivery and discharge care.",

    "abstract": "POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION AND THE NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT Postpartum depression is a medical diagnosis given to a woman within the first year after childbirth. Symptoms are very similar to depression including feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or worthlessness.1,2 These symptoms are more severe than common “baby blues” that present more mildly in nature such as tearfulness, frequent worrying, and tiredness. Postpartum depression affects approximately 20% of mothers3 and is estimated to be much higher in those women with a child in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).4 There are suggestions that women should be assessed for postpartum depression at time points other than their postpartum follow-up appointments with their obstetrician, including in the emergency department with a fussy child younger than 1 year.1,2 Often when the infant is medically cleared, it is the mother who needs medical attention. Although a NICU is the primary unit caring for ill and premature infants, it is the exact place where additional assessing and services for postpartum depression could occur. When the exciting day for that child to be discharged home from the NICU presents itself, it is imperative that we evaluate the entire home situation prior to discharge.3 Many times, NICU staff may not feel that they can control the environment these infants experience when going home. Examining that a mother's health is adequate to take on newborn care tasks and dealing with extensive, medically challenging situations is necessary to safeguard a child's initial entrance to home life. What is your NICU doing today to identify mothers who may present with symptoms of postpartum depression while visiting their infant? Is there sufficient skilled staffing support to add this responsibility within the NICU setting? A topic to consider when the goal is to send infants into the arms of competent and self-sufficient families. STABLE MICROBUBBLE TEST USING ORAL FLUID SAMPLES TO IDENTIFY RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME For decades, as technology and medicine have allowed premature infants to live beyond the NICU walls, the desire to predict the immaturity of lung development has also increased. Since the late 1900s, tests such as the stable microbubble test have been proposed, analyzed, and tested to be a sensitive and specific predictor for respiratory immaturity in infants from amniotic samples taken during an amniocentesis.5,6 Since this time, the use of the stable microbubble test has been an underutilized prenatal laboratory test result in the United States for pregnancies anticipated to end prematurely compared with the lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio test. Not all premature deliveries are expected, not every healthcare facility may have the technology to conduct a lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio test, and for those women, with little to no prenatal care, what is the best way to determine the risk for respiratory distress syndrome when an amniocentesis is no longer an option? Recently, research has shown that the use of the stable microbubble test performed as well as other samples types (ie, amniotic or gastric) in predicting respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants.7 In 64 patients born less than 34 weeks of gestation, a minimum of 0.2 mL of oral secretions was collected by the obstetrician in the delivery room. Test results were available within 5 minutes and at a low cost8 to assist in assessing whether a premature infant needed surfactant. A small microbubble test result less than 25 small microbubble (SM)/mm2 demonstrated a sensitivity of 81.4% and specificity of 85.7% on oral secretion samples in being able to predict surfactant deficiency.8 As a result, the stable microbubble test may be a bedside test to consider for any delivering hospital facility at the time of a premature birth when other sample types or tests are not available.",

    "abstract": "NEW YEAR, HEALTHY YOU! We have entered a new year and have set goals to make this year better. By the time you read this article, you may want to forget or quit how you had envisioned your new year unfolding. Remember you are not alone in meeting your goals! We all know that working long hours with high patient loads and few breaks can often result in poor eating choices, limited exercise, and self-care. Nurses are at higher risk for caregiver burnout, workplace injury, cardiac disease, and obesity. With more than 3 million nurses in the United States, an unhealthy nurse affects not only the health of the nursing population and our country but also all the patients he or she is expected to care for during his or her shift. Therefore, the American Nurses Association (ANA) is supporting the Healthy Nurse, Healthy Nation Grand Challenge.1 The program is free thanks to supporters and takes only a few minutes to sign up. The program focuses on 5 areas: (1) activity, (2) rest, (3) nutrition, (4) quality of life, and (5) safety. The program is an annual program, so you can revise your profile based on your previous year's changes. There are also webinars and other means by which the ANA reaches out to you throughout the year to help you stay focused on being healthy. There is no need to be a member of the ANA, but having an existing username and password reduce the time for signing up.

AN OPPORTUNITY TO NOMINATE THE GREAT Each year the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN) award nursing professionals an Award of Excellence in the following 4 areas: (1) practice, (2) education, (3) leadership, and (4) research.2 Those awarded have made a great impact on the nursing profession and on the women and neonatal populations. The Practice award incorporates bedside and advanced practice nursing roles. This award is given to recognize individuals who play a significant role in implementing evidence-based practice. Those designated under Education cover unit-based or academic educators who contribute to the educational growth of the nursing profession. Neonatal nurses in leadership roles from head of the department to administrator and political leader have an opportunity to receive the Leadership award. Individuals who would qualify for the Research award have conducted and published meaningful nursing research. The effort and dedication to make a difference can easily go unnoticed. Take the time to consider your colleagues who have gone above and beyond in their daily work. Nominations are due to AWHONN April 6, 2018. IS ACETAMINOPHEN FOR PDA CLOSURES GETTING MORE TRACTION? In the last 3 years, there have been 20 publications on the effectiveness and safety of paracetamol (acetaminophen) in premature infants with a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). With the desire to leave surgical closure as the last option, pharmacological treatment, which is often the first line of care, was indomethacin until about 10 years ago.3,4 Intravenous indomethacin is a cyclooxygenase inhibitor and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) known to have more severe side effects.5 Ibuprofen, also an NSAID, has been studied as well and has been shown to be a successful alternative to indomethacin.6 However, another drug is gaining more attention in PDA closures is acetaminophen due to its potentially less side effects as an analgesic and an antipyretic. A recent retrospective study examined the use of acetaminophen in 41 extremely low-birth weight infants using a 15 mg/kg dose every 6 hours.7 In 66% of infants, acetaminophen was successful in PDA closure. Those infants who failed acetaminophen treatment were more premature at birth. Laboratory findings did not demonstrate any side effects or concern for liver toxicity. Randomized trials are encouraged to assess the use of acetaminophen further due to the success of most patients no longer needing any PDA intervention.",

    "abstract": "CONFRONTING SMA HEAD-ON: MEET THE CAMBONIS On June 5, 2015, Marybeth and Chris Camboni received devastating news that their 4-month old daughter, Jacqueline (Jackie), had type 1 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a neuromuscular disease that causes significant morbidity in the neonate and is a leading hereditary cause of infant mortality.1 A rare disease, SMA is caused by the loss of lower motor neurons in the spinal cord that are critical to the function of nerves that control the muscles. As nerve cells die, they take with them the person's ability to walk, eat, and even breathe—similar to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in adults. While voluntary muscle movement is affected, the brain and other involuntary processes are not. SMA affects both genders, as well as all races and ethnicities. Four types of SMA have been identified (types 1-4). Historically, SMA has been a life-limiting disorder, with 95% of those with the most severe and common form (type 1) dying or becoming permanently ventilated by 2 years of age.1–4 But, 5 years later, the Camboni family is celebrating recent progress that allows for earlier identification and treatment of SMA and preparing for Jackie to start kindergarten! Amazing accomplishments that will no doubt change the face of this devastating disease. Yet, there is still more work to be done to ensure that all infants affected with SMA are identified and able to receive treatment. The incidence of SMA is approximately 1 in 11,000 live births and about 1 in every 50 Americans is a carrier of the disease.4 The Cambonis have 2 older children who are not affected, and no one in either of their extended families had ever been diagnosed with a genetic disease. Marybeth and Chris were shocked to learn that they both are SMA carriers. Because the disease is autosomal recessive, each parent has one normal copy and one mutant copy. With every pregnancy, there is a 25% chance that the child will inherit both copies of the mutant gene and be affected with SMA. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that comprehensive carrier screening information should be offered to every pregnant woman but, ideally, should occur prior to pregnancy to allow time for decision making.5 SMA was first discovered in 1890 by Drs Werdnig and Hoffman,1 but in 2015, when Jackie was diagnosed, there was STILL no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved treatment available and affected infants were offered supportive care. There were also no recommendations for carrier testing, and SMA had not been added to the newborn screening in any state because of its incurable status. But 2 clinical trials were testing nusinersen (Spinraza) and onasemnogene abeparvovec (Zolgensma). These therapies, limited to children with type 1 disease, who were 6 months or younger, work on different underlying causes of SMA. Zolgensma, a gene therapy, infuses a healthy copy of the SMN1 gene to restore cell function of the motor neurons, whereas Spinraza is given to boost the SMN2 gene to produce functional SMN protein that is needed to maintain motor function.6 As fate would have it, Marybeth was working at Nationwide Children's Hospital at the time of Jackie's diagnosis and was quickly referred to the now completed SMART clinical trial that was testing Zolgensma, developed there by researchers. Just 11 days after diagnosis, Jackie received the infusion. Fifteen babies were enrolled in the SMART trial, and families came from all over the world to participate. On December 23, 2016, Spinraza become the first FDA-approved treatment of SMA.7 Spinraza, delivered as a spinal infusion every 4 months for life, costs more than $200,000 per infusion. On August 3, 2017, Jackie became the first human to receive a combination of Zolgensma and Spinraza that would target both types of affected cells, the recommended therapy. Doctors thought she might be able to stand but only with braces. In late 2017, Jackie stood WITHOUT braces. Zolgensma was approved by the FDA on May 24, 2019.8 At $2.1 million, it became the world's most expensive drug therapy and available for children 2 years and younger with any type of SMA. The positive results are undeniable. Jackie is now considered to have strong type 2/weak type 3 SMA. She can speak, eat, sit, push her manual wheelchair, breathe independently, and walk in a gait trainer. Jackie is a feisty go-getter who does not see herself as being different from anyone else. She is also a trailblazer. It is anticipated that she will continue to improve and that one day she could even walk on her own. However, to be treated for SMA, a newborn must first be identified. In the summer of 2018, Alex Azar, Secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services, approved a recommendation that states should test all newborns for SMA.9 While the decision rests with each state regarding adding the test to its newborn screening panel, since this federal recommendation, 18 states have started screening newborns either permanently or through pilot testing.9 In Ohio, where the Cambonis live, the state is currently piloting SMA testing. Following the approval of a viable treatment option in December 2016, Marybeth contacted her Ohio State Representative Kristin Boggs (D). Enough support was generated around SMA and testing that House Bill 397 was drafted. In December 2017, the Cambonis, joined by a mother who lost her son to SMA in 2012 and a physician, gave testimony at the Ohio Statehouse in support of the bill (Figure 1). The bill did not leave the House of Representatives though because it was learned that the Ohio Department of Health Newborn Screening Advisory Panel could add SMA to the battery of tests on the newborn screen by vote, which they did almost unanimously on February 23, 2018. It took several months for the SMA test to be added, but all newborns born in Ohio in 2019 were screened. At the Ohio Newborn Screening Meeting in March 2020, it was announced that in the first year of testing, 8 infants were identified with SMA, 2 with type 1 and 6 with types 2 to 4 (M. Camboni, BS, personal communication, June 15, 2020), 8 lives that may potentially be altered through early identification and treatment. As the years multiply, so will the numbers of children whose lives can be saved and/or significantly improved.FIGURE 1: Camboni family newborn screening testimony at Ohio Statehouse. From Marybeth and Christopher Camboni, who have given permission to use the photographs provided of themselves and their children for publication. This figure and individual images within are © Marybeth and Christopher Camboni. Permission is required for reuse.This is great progress, but current indications are that infants who are diagnosed with SMA must be identified and treated before 2 years of age. The cost of treatment can be prohibitive for families, especially for those without insurance, those whose insurance will not authorize payment for the expensive treatment, or those who live outside of the United States and must pay out-of-pocket. Jackie does not currently qualify for Medicaid or the Children with Medical Handicaps Program in Ohio and has been on the Medicaid waitlist since 2015. The Cambonis feel lucky that their insurance company agreed to cover costs above their deductible for her ongoing treatments, which run about $750,000 per year. Some families ultimately choose to take lower-paying jobs or to make their child a ward of the state so that they can qualify for Medicaid. These are hard decisions that families unfortunately have to make in the midst of caring for their ill child. It is also unclear how treatment costs may ultimately affect decisions regarding the inclusion of SMA testing on state newborn screening panels but is certainly an ethical consideration for continued discussion. As is true with many childhood diseases, new scientific advances and treatments come about through passion and advocacy. As healthcare providers, it is crucial for us to recognize and acknowledge the full spectrum of issues families may encounter when their child is diagnosed with any potentially life-threatening or life-limiting illness. In the neonatal intensive care unit, education and support of the family are critical as they begin to receive and navigate crucial information and make decisions. We can also join with families to advocate for improvements in care and treatment delivery, as well as for policies and legislation that ensure children diagnosed with SMA have access to lifesaving therapies. Marybeth and Chris Camboni set forth to bring about process changes that they felt might help other families. They know all too well that with SMA, the earlier the diagnosis is made, the better the chance to obtain treatment, and the longer survival may ultimately be. It is unclear how long Jackie may live. But she has exceeded initial expectations. And, she is achieving milestones, such as starting school. Furthermore, new treatments of SMA continue to evolve. Oral risdiplam was granted priority review by the FDA in November 2019, with an approval decision expected in August 2020.10 Jackie's parents have hope that she, and other children diagnosed with SMA, will continue to defy the odds. While not all families have the ability to testify at the Statehouse, each family does have their own strength and passion that can be leveraged to support their child. We can help them through continued education and advocacy. These remarkable children and their families are counting on it.",

    "abstract": "Dear neonatal colleagues, I am thrilled to introduce this special Advances in Neonatal Care series, titled “Care of the Infant and Family Affected by Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) Across Multiple Settings.” In this series, we showcase the innovative work occurring within the field of neonatal care to support families impacted by NAS and contribute to better health outcomes and quality of life. In the context of our current nationwide opioid crisis, opioid use in pregnancy has quadrupled in the United States.1 Accordingly, NAS rates have also increased by 5-fold, with 1 US2 infant now being born every 15 minutes experiencing the withdrawal symptoms of NAS that include gastrointestinal distress, tremors, and a high-pitched, inconsolable cry.3 While there is no universally agreed-upon standard of care for these infants and their families, their care has traditionally been provided in the high-acuity environment of a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).4,5 Some experts are now beginning to question whether this environment is truly the most ideal for infants with NAS.6 The management of newborn withdrawal symptoms usually begins with common soothing techniques such as swaddling, rocking, skin-to-skin holding, and breastfeeding. However, because of the nature of most NICUs, infants are often separated from their mothers, which is a barrier to these recommended soothing techniques.7 Furthermore, if the hospital environment is such that the mother is unable to be present or feels uncomfortable visiting her infant, her ability to sooth and comfort her own infant may be jeopardized.8–10 This has not only led to some challenges for neonatal care providers but has also inspired the pioneering of novel approaches, such as those you will discover in this special series. The second line of management for infants with NAS is pharmacologic intervention using some type of opioid whether naturally occurring such as morphine or synthetic such as methadone. While medications may be necessary to alleviate some NAS symptoms, their initiation has been linked to longer and more costly hospitalizations11 and a prolonged separation of infants from their primary caregivers.6 Furthermore, longitudinal research on the safety of these medications in young infants is lacking.6 For some neonatal care providers, care of the NAS-impacted family has resulted in challenges to include internal conflicts about the disease of addiction.12–15 According to the American Society of Addiction Medicine, “Addiction is a treatable, chronic medical disease involving complex interactions among brain circuits, genetics, the environment, and an individual's life experiences.”16 Yet, for many, substance use in pregnant and parenting women remains an emotionally charged issue that may be surrounded by stigma and personal bias. Neonatal care providers play a critical role in dismantling this health-related stigma that can interfere with quality, early maternal–infant interactions and attachment. As neonatal care providers, we must all examine our own thoughts and beliefs about substance use in pregnant and parenting women. Not only must we not participate in stigmatizing behavior that can impact the families we serve but we must also act as change agents who address this stigma head-on when we witness it in the patient care setting. We should further strive to be powerful advocates for the families we serve both locally and nationally. First, we can ensure supportive policies and procedures in our units and hospitals. These policies should be designed to limit separation of infants from their mothers. Next, we can be champions for change at the state and national levels advocating for legislation that supports wholistic and affordable treatment and recovery support services for families impacted by substance use. Less punitive approaches that support the integrity of the family are critical and have the potential to impact future generations.17,18 Ten years ago, when I first began my journey of research and program development focused on families impacted my NAS, very little was known about these families or the multiple challenges they face on a day-to-day basis. Worse, no one was even asking the types of questions you will see presented in this special series. Some had reservations about my interest in this topic and wondered why I was pursing this line of research and program development. Today, I am truly encouraged by the progress of the science this special issue represents. However, there is always a need for continued research to improve outcomes for these families. In conclusion, it is truly my pleasure to present to you this in-depth series on the care of families affected by NAS. Through these thoughtful articles, I believe you will come to better understand the important role we, as neonatal care providers, play in supporting and caring for families affected by NAS. Thank you so much for your interest in this topic and for your compassionate care of these families. Lisa M.

    "abstract": "Background: Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) infants frequently require peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) placement for medication and nutrition. The occurrence of leaking catheters led to practice evaluation of manual intravenous (IV) flush and medication push technique in an upper Midwest NICU. A variation in unit practice was revealed. Purpose: To describe an evidence-based practice change that standardized medication administration, eliminating routine manual IV push medication and flush administration and reducing catheter malfunction. Emergency “code” medication administration was not addressed. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed. A unit practice investigation ensued to study medication administration techniques and syringe size utilization, understand syringe pressure generated by various sizes of syringes, select optimal IV tubing supplies, review the smart pump library, electronic order sets/documentation, and address staff knowledge and skills. Practice change eliminating IV push and recommendations incorporating best evidence occurred. Results: Moving from a traditional method of manual pushing/flushing medication to use of medication delivery via smart pump can decrease or eliminate PICC damage and potential harm to neonatal patients. Implications for Practice: Examination of IV push technique may identify opportunities for safer medication administration. Use of an infusion pump and a dedicated medication line can be a feasible option to deliver most IV medication doses in the NICU. Implications for Research: Safe medication administration practices for the neonatal population and barriers to that practice.

In the rush of moment, installing the car seat base in the heat of the afternoon, with his mother-in-law, his infant's nurse, and myself holding the infant in the car seat, along with a few bags of supplies for the infant, he only took a fraction of a second to do it. But right there, in that moment, it felt like time stopped. The air felt heavy, the sounds drowned out to silence, and as I father myself I recognized in his face what this was. It was a look of love. I have seen it many times before. The first time a father lays his eyes on his newborn infant is always different. It's always new. Usually, it is during or immediately after delivery. It is often without speech. But even if a picture is worth a thousand words, the image every time is indescribable. It is love. Typically, the birth of an infant, especially in an operating room (OR), is filled with lots of people. Nurses taking care of the mother and nurses taking care of the infant. Nurse practitioners right there to \"catch\" the infant and wrap in a blanket, obstetricians and their team at the surgical site, and anesthesiologists at the head of the bed. The father anxiously standing by, peering on toes next to neonatologists at the ready. In this particular case, with this specific infant, instead of the father being there, it was me. It was us. She was the first infant born in our COVID OR, in the specifically built COVID unit. The OR had been equipped and prepared for weeks, if not months, but doctors and nurses, practitioners, and respiratory therapists to develop plans for deliveries just like this one was. We had spent days setting up machines, placing beds, and staging trays and lights. And then we spent days and weeks rearranging and adjusting it all again, as we talked through situations and scenarios. For days, we had mapped out who of our staff was going to be working, who was going to be going to the delivery, who was going to do what, who was going to be where. It was my plan to switch places with the nurse who was supposed to be going, to minimize her risk of exposure and, hopefully, her anxiety. But as the confident and dutiful nurse she has always been, she refused to do anything less than to be right there for the infant. So by the time the COVID-positive mother was brought in, they closed the doors and it was us two. Next to our neonatologist, the 3 of us were the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) team ready to receive and, if necessary, stabilize and resuscitate this little baby girl. The room was a flurry of action. With assured confidence and precision, I admired the Labor & Delivery staff who worked quickly and efficiently to make sure everything was set. It was as if they had done this thousands of times before. The thing was they had. Just never like this. In a negative pressure OR, with noisy HEPA filters, a smaller than usual space, and personal protective equipment (PPE) covering our mouths and noses, our eyes, our faces, our hair, bodies, and even shoes, all of us were uniformly protected from any chance of exposure. I remember looking at the mother's face. Calm, eyes closed. When the infant was born, instead of her father present, it was the physician and myself, alongside her nurse, the first to see her, the first to touch her, the first to talk to her. It was decided that she would be admitted to the NICU. So as I assisted in unplugging and unlocking the enclosed isolette to transport, I couldn't help but recognize that unlike most deliveries, the mother would not get the chance to hold her infant right away. As we exited the room, despite all the other things going on, the Labor & Delivery staff moved poles and carts to clear a path. As we came out of the room, there were more of our team members outside, ready to assist with whatever they could. Our NICU charge nurse took the lead, as we took off and put on more PPE since we were leaving the room. Like this infant's own personal entourage, we walked to the exit of the unit where more NICU nurses and Respiratory Therapy were there to receive the bed, attach our support \"shuttle\" for additional oxygen and power support, and bring the whole production down to the NICU. The next few days were new to us. The entire multidisciplinary team worked seamlessly to make sure this mother and family were updated. One of our nurses created a new Skype account for the mother to be able to video call and see her infant using her cell phone. Our nurse practitioners and provider team kept in constant contact to communicate plans for discharge. Social work was involved, all of our managers stayed in touch, and we used a newly purchased car seat to test the infant in, and then give to the family so they would not need to bring one in from home. Our medical director was involved, our neonatal nurse practitioner administrator helped facilitate any needs, and Nursing had the constant resources from our leadership in Maternal Child Health, our director, and even our chief nursing officer. When the day of discharge came, the whole team worked to coordinate times for pickup, who would be coming into the hospital to meet us, where they would park, where the father would wait. The infant's nurse that day spent the entire shift preparing enough bottles, diapers, discharge information, and even clothing to be as ready to go out into the world as any newborn infant could be. We put on our PPE and together, she and I took the infant down to the emergency department (ED). I coordinated with the manager of the ED, who made sure we had a place to go, and what the best way to go would be, as well as the best route for us and the family. In the humid heat of the afternoon, I stood at the entrance alongside our COVID screeners, ready to meet the father and escort the grandmother in. I knew it was them when they showed up, the anxious father and his excited mother-in-law. \"Hola abuela!\" I said, \"Me llamo Joe, soy enfermero con to nueva nina!\" (Hi grandma! I'm Joe, a nurse with your new baby girl!). As the father waited outside, the nurse and I walked the grandmother through discharge paperwork, and finally gave her the infant to see, hold and now feed, for the very first time. ED nurses and even physicians stopped in their tracks as they walked by, smiling at the beautiful infant in her grandmother's arms. After just a few minutes, it was time to walk out. Back through the corridors, we all exited into the heat. Again, this little infant's own personal entourage. I gave the father the base of the car seat and I could see him struggling, and sweating to get it secured in. And as he turned, I extended the tiny infant in her car seat toward his waiting arms. \"Felicidades!\" I exclaimed. And right there, I saw it. In the heat of the outside, rather than the cool of the OR, into his hands instead of ours, this man recognized, and for the briefest of moments, stared at his new daughter for the first time. It doesn't happen often, even for an NICU nurse to be there for both the delivery and also the discharge home, but this time it was me. In the moment that time stopped. In the moment of recognition, as a father myself in the eyes of another father, the look I have seen many times before, but new and amazing each time. It was a look of love. For all of our planning, our weeks and days and sleepless nights. For our staff who worried but were always there. Through the stress of the world, for our team who demonstrated kindness and deep compassion. Through the endless meetings, the constant e-mails, through the questions and concerns and even through the tears, it was and always is moments like this that remind us of who we are.

    "abstract": "Dear NANN colleagues, As we gaze into the future for Advances in Neonatal Care in 2021, we can't help but wonder how you are feeling right now? COVID-19 has changed everything about our world. We, like you, have been doing a bit of reading during this time, trying to understand why and how to manage these new and ever-changing daily events. Some might describe how we are feeling as: “That feeling when you know you can't go backward and yet you don't know what forward looks like.”1 We are all too far into this “new normal” to go back, yet the direction for moving forward also seems ambiguous. Anxiety seems to be sitting ominously in every corner, warning us to keep up our guard, waiting potentially for the next shoe to drop. At the same time, we are not only bored, listless, afraid, uncertain, and ever busy but also seeming to get much less accomplished, even though we are trying to carry on with our jobs, careers, and caring for families and friends. In the beginning of the pandemic, there was a surge of energy to fill the time in lockdown and social distancing with activities. However, as the pandemic has lingered on, the adrenaline surge is dwindling and we find ourselves somewhat unsettled and unable to concentrate in the ways that we have in the past, especially since there is no real end in sight. This is particularly true as what seems beyond the “endpoint” does not appear to be what we envision as “back to normal.” Others have described this time as a space for reflection, for reconsidering our values, and for possibly choosing a new path that is more aligned with our personal sense of purpose. A time to find our true selves and time to reflect and better understand others. We also believe this is a time to explore new opportunities and challenges, to think outside the box. A time to be confident, clear, and fierce in providing care that protects and gives rise to the best outcomes for infants and families. Recently, we read a Web-based article on the ancient Greek emotion called Acedia.2 We had not heard that term before; its use has faded with time. The emotion, Acedia, can be described as listlessness such as watching the time come go by but also noticing that it seems to pass so slowly, the minutes seem like hours and hours seem like days—and we also notice the exhaustion that comes with this emotion. For example, that feeling that the shift will never end. Interesting, the definition for this word rose in popularity during medieval times from the solitary lifestyle of monks in a monastery. Hopefully, that visual provides you with the connection to this time of social distancing, limited physical contact (no hugs), and lockdown. While the word Acedia is barely used today, using it could help us legitimize how we are feeling and give us the opportunity to consider how to move on. Even when we are physically together in the unit, it is not like we would prefer. We see each other, but the face mask is the new barrier. There are no hugs or handshakes. We cannot see smiles or friendly facial expressions. Birthdays, retirement celebrations, and other comings and goings in our workplace are virtual events. Social gatherings with our colleagues outside of work are nonexistent, and we hardly see our extended family members who don't live with us. Learning ways to positively share and express these emotions and frustrations gives us a way to get through this time together. To find new ways to connect. To reach out to each other so we are all together on the other side of this pandemic. We know neonatal nurses are fighters, and we know we can get through this together. We welcome 2021 with you. Be confident, clear, and fierce in your determination to do good. Thank you to our readership and for your submissions to Advances in Neonatal Care. Jacqueline M.

    "abstract": "Congratulations to Advances in Neonatal Care (Advances) on their 20th anniversary! Advances has been identified as the number 1 benefit of membership in the National Association of Neonatal Nurses (NANN) year after year, and for good reason. All nurses, especially neonatal nurses who care for the most vulnerable of neonates, are hungry for more knowledge and strive to provide the best evidence-based care to neonates and their families. Advances, the official journal of NANN since 2001, provides the latest in research, highlights best practices in neonatal nursing care, outlines new approaches to care, and stimulates critical thinking in its readers. Our peer-reviewed journal provides a venue for dissemination of information to a wide audience of not only neonatal nurses, but to all healthcare providers that provide care to well, ill, and premature neonates. In addition, Advances provides an opportunity for both experienced and young researchers and clinicians to hone their writing skills. Advances supports the novice author via instruction, feedback, and mentorship along every step of the publishing path. The journal supports participants from NANN's annual Research Summit by publishing many of their studies. In addition, workshops on writing for a professional journal have been held at the last several NANN annual meetings and will continue to be offered, as many conference attendees have participated. These presentations have also led to authors having their work published in Advances as well as other venues. Together, the leadership of NANN and Advances meet quarterly to develop strategic plans for the journal as well as to anticipate and meet future needs of the membership and the neonatal nursing community. NANN utilizes the journal to provide information to the membership regarding association news, advocacy activities, white papers, position statements, new guidelines, and many other topics. Standards of care are disseminated through Advances and are available to nurses practicing not only across the United States, but also the world. The reach of our journal goes well beyond our membership, as it is indexed in Medline and PubMed and has many university library and institutional subscribers, in addition to international nurses and other healthcare professionals. In addition to being indexed, the peer-reviewed journal achieved an Impact Factor of 1.244 in 2018, which was higher than the other 3 neonatal nursing journals Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, & Neonatal Nursing (1.219), Journal of Perinatal and Neonatal Nursing (1.133), and Neonatal Network (0.55).1 This impact factor measures the importance of a journal based on the frequency of article citations. Contributors to the journal mirror our membership, with participation from clinical nurses, advanced practice nurses, clinicians, researchers, and faculty. Many submissions come from interdisciplinary teams, collaborating to bring new knowledge and approaches to readers. International contributors have expanded NANN's boundaries, illuminating issues faced around the world. The voice of the parent and family is also represented in Advances pages. In recent years, efforts to engage younger members of the neonatal profession have led to the addition of a clinical nurse to the editorial board, development of an online version of the journal, and forays into social media to highlight important topics. As neonatal nurses, we should feel great pride as we reflect on the contributions of Advances to the knowledge base of neonatal nursing over the last 20 years. We are grateful for the dedication and skill of our past and current editors, Dr Madge Buus-Frank, Dr Catherine Witt, Dr Debra H. Brandon, and Dr Jacqueline M. McGrath, all past and present editorial board members, content editors, publication and editorial staff, and contributing authors, which are too numerous to individually name. Through their efforts, knowledge has been advanced, neonatal nursing as a profession has grown and flourished, and countless infants and their families have received outstanding, evidence-based care with improved quality of life and outcomes. As you know, 2020 is the Year of the Nurse and we can't imagine a better time to celebrate the meaningful and impactful contributions of so many talented and generous neonatal nurses. Happy 20th Anniversary Advances, we are proud to be your partner in improving neonatal care in the United States and world and look forward to many years of continued collaboration! —Joan Rikli, MBA, MSN, RN, CPNP-PC, NE-BC Helen DeVos Children's Hospital, Grand Rapids, Michigan President, National Association of Neonatal Nurses [email protected] —Gail A.

    "abstract": "NANN PARTNERS WITH PATIENT-LED ORGANIZATIONS TO ADVANCE CARE FOR VULNERABLE NEONATES Jennifer Canvasser, MSW; Linseigh Green, BA; Joan Rikli, MBA, MSN, RN, CPNP, NE-BC Nann closely partners with parent-led organizations such as the Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) Society.1 The NEC Society is the world's leading NEC nonprofit organization that brings together diverse stakeholders with the mission to “build a world without necrotizing enterocolitis.” To learn about how and why the NEC Society was launched, please refer to the January 2019 NANN Noteworthy Professional News.2 In 2019, NANN became more deeply engaged with the NEC Society by supporting and participating in the NEC Symposium at the University of Michigan,3 which attracted a total of 220 (including nearly 50 neonatal nurses and 20 families affected by NEC) attendees from Japan, Brazil, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Kenya, Australia, China, Mexico, Canada, and 30 US states. The program offered highly scientific and educational sessions, as well as compelling workshops, which directly engaged the researchers, clinicians, industry partners, and patient-families. One such workshop was attended by several NANN members, physicians, and parents, as well as NEC survivors themselves to explore the challenges that NEC survivors face later in life, long after discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The workshop focused on identifying and prioritizing the actionable items that can be incorporated into future research projects. The participating NEC survivors' lived-experience offered valuable information to the attendees in a way that textbooks and scholarly articles have never offered.Linseigh Green survived NEC as an infant, recently graduated from New York University, and is now in graduate school at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. Linseigh reflects on her participation at the NEC Symposium by sharing the following: “After discovering at the age of 16 that my years of health struggles were actually long-term complications of NEC, I struggled with access to proper care and credibility, which made me feel like a lost cause. The NEC Society has given me a platform to speak out and to demonstrate that surviving necrotizing enterocolitis does not end when an infant is discharged from the NICU. My family and I felt heard for the first time. I facilitated one of the workshops at the NEC Symposium on empowering patient-families. It was remarkable to see ‘both sides of the examination table’ collaborating on ways to address disparities in research, care, and social-emotional resources. Most of the clinicians who attended didn't know that survivors lived with long-term issues in the first place, revealing that long-term complications of NEC are poorly understood today. I am proud to work with the NEC Society to change this by helping to advance research. I met a team here who genuinely wants to help families like mine. The NEC Symposium taught us that some things cannot be learned in a research lab or training programs. One must engage with those who have been personally affected by the disease to understand us.” In response to the overwhelming inquiries from global colleagues after the Symposium about how a patient-led initiative pulled off such an impactful conference, the NEC Society published a 10-step guide to hosting an All-In Meeting.4 The NEC Society defines All-In Meetings as transdisciplinary medically oriented conferences that aim to integrate and empower patient-families to contribute the expertise they gained from their lived experience. As an example, the NEC Symposium dedicated each session to a patient-family affected by NEC with a slide of the honoree and a statement, which powerfully reminded all of the stakeholders on the urgency of the work. Many of these families whose children were honored were actually participating in the Symposium alongside nurses, physicians, and scientists. NANN and Michigan Chapter of NANN were both present as exhibitors. Joan Rikli, current president of NANN, attended the NEC Symposium and represented NANN. She found the meeting to be inspiring and informative, and it moved her to incorporate what she learned into action at NANN. Those who attended the recent NANN conference in Savannah, Georgia, may remember that NANN dedicated every session to infants who either survived their NICU hospitalization or passed away following their time in the NICU. NANN is working to implement more aspects of the NEC Society's All-In Meeting guide for the 36th Annual Conference in New Orleans, October 10 to 13, 2020.5 Joan Rikli shares: “Not only was this meeting important from the standpoint of presenting the latest research and treatment protocols, it was also incredibly impactful to hear from parents, families and patients who have experienced this horrible disease. Their courageous openness and honesty regarding what we've done well and how we can do better sent a strong message. They embraced the mantra of ‘nothing about me without me’ and challenged us to include them in every aspect of care possible. I am confident that through the collaboration of researchers, scientists, clinicians, and families-patients, we will make significant inroads into understanding, treating and beating NEC.” Furthermore, NANN members, including Dr Jenny Quinn,6 Dr Shelia Gephart, and Dr Wakako Eklund, are serving on the NEC Society's core leadership team to support the NEC Society to ensure the perspective and expertise of nurses are prioritized in the organization's research, projects, and events. For example, the NEC Society recently received a $250,000 Engagement Award from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute.7 NANN members along with other researchers, clinicians, and patient-families are helping to lead this project to strengthen the NEC Society's capacity to advance patient-centered NEC research. Part of NANN's collaboration with the NEC Society brings more acute focus on this devastating disease in a way that generates action. By working together to raise awareness, we can demonstrate to stakeholders outside of the NICU why nurses detest NEC. NICU nurses know firsthand how quickly NEC progresses, too often claiming the lives of infants who had already overcome many of their earliest obstacles, blindsiding all who are involved. Therefore, NANN members will work with the NEC Society to highlight the World NEC Awareness Day on May 17, 2020.8 The NEC Society looks forward to working with NANN members for their first-ever NEC Advocacy Day in Washington, District of Columbia.8 Together, we will educate and inform Members of Congress about necrotizing enterocolitis and why increased support for the federal funding, specifically for the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development,9 is critical to advancing the research for our most vulnerable infants at risk of NEC. The 2020 NEC Advocacy Day8 will help to set the framework for the NEC Symposium 2021 at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, April 13 to 16, 2021. The NEC Society's 2021 meeting is expected to draw even more, globally diverse participants. Please stay tuned for the exciting announcements coming later this year. The NEC Society looks forward to continuing to strengthen the partnership with NANN in 2020 and beyond. Parents and nurses spend more time with NICU infants than anyone; therefore, nurses and parents are natural partners. By collaborating with patient-led organizations, NANN is epitomizing what it means to make a difference for neonatal nurses, patients, and families.",

    "abstract": "Physical examination is both an art and a science. In our technology-laden environment, it is in danger of becoming a lost art form. It requires a keen eye, a good ear, a skilled touch, and a systematic approach. The ability to synthesize complex historical factors; an understanding of concomitant risks; and anatomy, physiology, and the natural history of neonatal diseases is an essential skill. This regularly occurring column, “Focus on the Physical,” will help the busy clinician assess and categorize findings as normal, atypical, abnormal, or potentially life threatening. Our column editors are Dr. David Clark and Ms. Susan Furdon, both from the Children's Hospital at Albany Medical Center. Dr. Clark is Professor and Chairperson and Director of the Children's Hospital. He is an avid photographer and has used his talents to develop an extensive collection of clinical photographs of unique physical findings in the neonate, a portion of which were published in the Atlas of Neonatology. Ms. Furdon is an advanced practice nurse who has successfully combined the roles of a clinical nurse specialist and neonatal nurse practitioner. She has published and lectured on pain, congenital heart defects, and the care of extremely low birth weight infants. Dr. Clark and Ms. Furdon believe that a picture says a thousand words and will help you to focus on important physical findings, because the most powerful diagnostic tool to date is a thorough history coupled with the constant vigilance of a skilled bedside clinician.—MBF",

    "abstract": "Utility of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with an intravenous lipid emulsion (IVLE) component is common in the neonatal intensive care unit; however, there are inherent risks to TPN use. With IVLE administered separate from other TPN components, opportunities exist for additional error and subsequent potential harm.We present 2 cases in term infants where IVLE infusions were noted to be inadvertently administered at higher than prescribed rates, prompting concern for lipemia and end-organ damage due to hyperviscosity.Both infants developed iatrogenic hypertriglyceridemia and hyponatremia.Upon recognition of the error, IVLE was immediately discontinued in each case. Triglyceride levels were serially monitored until they reached a normal level. Electrolyte panels and hepatic function panels were also drawn to assess for electrolyte derangements and function. Radiologic studies were performed for evaluation of end-organ effects of hyperviscosity.Triglyceride levels for both infants normalized within 7 hours. Both infants survived to discharge without any known effects related to the inadvertent excessive lipid infusion.It is helpful to perform a root-cause analysis for these types of events; have the exact amount of lipids in the bag needed and no overfill; consider having lipids in 4-hour dosage aliquots; require 2 nurses to verify infusion rates hourly; and educational sessions and unit protocols for any infusion may reduce the risk of administration error.",

    "abstract": "Scholarly writing is a time- and energy-intensive activity. Scholarly research products often reflect years of hard work, from initial grant writing and funding to data collection, analysis, writing, and working through the publication process. Whether it is a literature review, case study, or reporting on a quality improvement project or research study, getting your manuscript to publication requires hard work and persistence. Then, finally—publication! But, that's not the end. The purpose of all of that time and energy is to make change. Change only happens when people know about the work. Promoting your work to maximize readership by a broad audience is a critical aspect of ensuring maximum impact. In today's world of social media, the opportunities for promoting your work are considerably greater than in previous years. Using an example of my own scholarly publication, I will share ways in which I harnessed the power of these platforms, as well as more traditional platforms, to increase awareness and impact of my work. In 2019, I published an article called “Know the Flow: Milk Flow Rates From Bottle Nipples Used in the Hospital and After Discharge” in Advances in Neonatal Care.1 At the time, this was the third article that I published on the general topic of flow rates from bottle nipples. Knowing this was a topic of relevance to multiple disciplines and to people working in the hospital and in the community setting, I intentionally published these 3 articles1–3 in different journals, with target audiences that reflected the people who needed this information to make change at the point of care. Prior to the publication of the 2019 article, I had also spent several years sharing flow rate information with different audiences at national and regional conferences of neonatal nurses and speech-language pathologists. I knew this would be a major topic of interest when I presented data at the NANN Research Summit where the overwhelming response was—“Wait. WHAT?!! NICU nurses need to know this!” Having sparked interest in the topic over the course of several years, I was thrilled when “Know the Flow”1 was first published online in 2018 and then in print in 2019. At each of these time points, I shared the link to the publication with audiences on social media. With concerns about data privacy, I have moved away from using these platforms for sharing personal and family information, but I have continued to use them for professional purposes, especially for professional groups with large audience numbers. In March of 2020, I was featured in an article in the Boston College Magazine.4 When this publication was due to be released, I requested that “Know the Flow”1 be made open access for a short period of time so that anyone who was interested could read the full article. Later, At the NANN conference in 2020, it was announced that “Know the Flow”1 won Research Article of the Year from the previous year for Advances in Neonatal Care. At the time of this announcement, the article was made open access for 30 days. During each of these open access times, I took the opportunity to share widely and often to maximize exposure. As of the day of writing this editorial, the “Know the Flow”1 article has an Altmetric score of 20, which is among the highest-scoring articles (#19 out of 556) from Advances in Neonatal Care. More importantly, all of this exposure has made an impact on practice and the infant product industry. Many institutions have used these data to guide decisions about the products used to feed their most vulnerable infants. Data are powerful and it has been important to share these data with people in leadership positions who were able to enact change. In some hospitals, products that have historically been used in the NICU (eg, the red nipple) have been removed from inventory because of my work showing the flow rate compared with other products. In the infant product industry, one company is now testing their products using my flow rate testing methodology and is advertising these flow rates on their Web site. Another company that produces single-use nipples has created a new product with slower flow rates than the other products in their line. The added effort to promote this work after publication has been incredibly important in facilitating this impact. So, when your hard works pays off and your scholarly work is published, don't stop there! Promote your work to ensure it has maximum exposure and impact.5,6 Recommendations for promoting your work: Share your work on social media and don't be shy—share often and widely! Give a quick summary or most important finding to entice readers. Get your work in the hands of the people who need it to make change. Present at conferences locally, nationally, and internationally. Email professionals who you think may be interested and share your publication with them. Keep professional profiles updated with your publications and include hyperlinks for people to access your work easily. Sincerely, Britt F. Pados, PhD, RN, NNP-BC, CLC, FAHA, FNAP Assistant Professor; Boston College School of Nursing",

    "abstract": "Background: Neonatal hypothermia is common around the world; however, profound hypothermia is a very rare—but life-threatening—event. Clinical Findings: This was a very rare case involving a 15-day old preterm infant diagnosed with profound hypothermia (rectal temperature, 27°C) concomitant with severe coagulation dysfunction and leukopenia on admission. Primary Diagnosis: Profound hypothermia together with severe coagulopathy, leukopenia, late-onset sepsis, and pneumonia. Interventions: The patient was rewarmed slowly, with a rectal temperature rising at a rate of 0.5°C/h &lt; R &lt; 1°C/h. Vital signs were closely monitored. Coagulation factors were supplemented by intravenous infusion of fresh frozen plasma. Supportive treatment with intravenous infusion of immunoglobulin was provided, and antibiotics were used empirically. Nil per os and intravenous rehydration were also implemented. Outcomes: The condition of the preterm infant gradually improved and was successfully discharged. Practice Recommendations: Profound hypothermia is very rare in preterm infants. However, once it occurs, it may be concomitant with severe coagulopathy and leukopenia. Successful management involves slow rewarming, prompt supplementation of coagulation factors, empirical antibiotics, and supportive treatment.",

    "abstract": "Background: Benign neonatal hemangiomatosis (BNH) is a rare, self-limiting subtype of infantile hemangiomas (IHs), in which infants with multiple cutaneous hemangiomas lack visceral involvement. Other subtypes of IHs exist that may mimic BNH and can be life-threatening depending on hemangioma location and size. Clinical Findings: At birth, a 29 5 / 7 -week preterm female presented with several pinhead-sized pink papules distributed throughout her body. At 10 days of age, the patient had 12 enlarged domed-shaped red papules in a generalized distribution throughout her body. Over several weeks, the number and size of the domed-shaped red papules continued to increase to a total of 26 located on the head, chest, abdomen, back, legs and arms. They were of firm consistency with both smooth and lobulated surfaces. Primary Diagnosis: A diagnosis of BNH was made after extensive workup did not reveal any extracutaneous hemangiomas. Interventions: Due to the lack of extracutaneous involvement and low-risk location/size of hemangiomas in our patient, no interventions were pursued and an observation-only approach was implemented. Outcomes: The patient remained stable while followed up over 8 months, with the size of the hemangiomas only increasing slightly in proportion to the patient's natural body growth. Practice Recommendations: Given the life-threatening nature of certain hemangioma subtypes, it is important to implement a proper workup and subtype diagnosis as early as possible in any infant with multiple hemangiomas.",

The American Academy of Pediatrics endorses the use of safe sleep practices with specific recognition of the unique challenges faced in the NICU setting.The purpose of this quality improvement (QI) project was to implement a safe sleep bundle and evaluate its effectiveness in improving caregiver compliance to safe sleep practices in a level III NICU at a large joint military medical facility.A QI initiative with a pre- and postanalysis was performed using a convenience method of sampling. Infants 32 weeks or more post-menstrual age in a level III NICU were analyzed pre- and post-interventions. The intervention included a safe sleep bundle that encompassed: (1) policy update, (2) standardized sleep sacks, (3) crib cards and certificates, and (4) creation of a provider order set in the electronic health record (EHR). A standardized crib audit tool evaluated sleep and bed position, items in the crib, order set in the EHR with consideration of special medical circumstances.Postintervention assessment after the implementation resulted in a significant improvement of overall safe sleep compliance modeled by NICU staff, increasing to 100% from a baseline of 18% pre-intervention (P = .029).Role-modeling behaviors of clinical staff may reduce the risk of sleep-related infant deaths upon discharge. A multifactorial approach can leverage successful strategies for improving safe sleep compliance in a NICU setting.",

    "abstract": "Benefits of mother's own milk (MOM) for infants in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) are well known. Many mothers provide for their infant's feedings during their entire hospitalization while others are unable. Knowledge is limited about which infant and maternal factors may contribute most to cessation of MOM feedings.Study aims were to (1) identify which maternal and infant risk factors or combination of factors are associated with cessation of provision of MOM during hospitalization, (2) develop a lactation risk tool to identify neonatal intensive care unit infants at higher risk of not receiving MOM during hospitalization, and (3) identify when infants stop receiving MOM during hospitalization.A data set of 797 infants admitted into a level IV neonatal intensive care unit before 7 days of age, whose mothers chose to provide MOM, was created from analysis of data from the Children's Hospital Neonatal Database. Maternal and infant factors of 701 dyads who received MOM at discharge were compared with 87 dyads who discontinued use of MOM by discharge using χ 2 , t tests, and Wilcoxon rank tests. Logistic regression was used to build a risk-scoring model.The probability of cessation of MOM increased significantly with the number of maternal-infant risk factors. A Risk Calculator was developed to identify dyads at higher risk for cessation of MOM by discharge.Identifying mothers at risk for cessation of MOM can enable the healthcare team to provide optimal lactation management and outcomes.Although the Risk Calculator has potential to identify dyads at risk of early MOM cessation, further research is needed to validate these results.",

NANN's 38th Annual Conference, taking place September 14-17, 2022, in Las Vegas, Nevada, will offer live and virtual options for all attendees. Celebrate Neonatal Nurses Week together in the heart of the Las Vegas strip or from the comfort of home. NANN in Vegas will offer the latest clinical education and new networking opportunities for neonatal nurses and advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs).

MEET THE 2022 KEYNOTE SPEAKERS! Opening General Session Banishing Burnout: Resiliency and Well-being for Neonatal Nurses Eileen T. O'Grady, PhD, RN, NP The complex environment that neonatal nurses inhabit requires a fierce commitment to one's own well-being. This session will present the evidence on how we can navigate difficulty and still flourish as human beings and become the CEO of our own lives. A nurse practitioner wellness expert will present ideas on how to practice self-leadership, form habits that serve us and practice extreme self-care, no matter your circumstances. Second General Session The Racial Disparity in Adverse Birth Outcome: Putting the Spotlight on Structural Racism James W. Collins, Jr, MD, MPH Despite dramatic improvements in neonatal intensive care since the 1960s, the African American:non-Latinx White infant mortality rate ratio increased from 1.6 to 2.2. Preterm birth is the primary determinant of infant survival, and African American infants remain more than twice as likely to be born less than 34 weeks compared with White infants. This presentation will highlight the presenter's research team's published studies on the impact of race as a social construct, thus addressing the impact of racism in its various forms, on birth outcome. As clinicians in the neonatal intensive care unit, neonatal nurses will be better prepared to make a meaningful difference in parents' lives during this time of crisis by relating to them with understanding and respect. Moreover, as members of society, neonatal nurses will be encouraged to support initiatives that address the social and economic inequities that are the root cause of birth outcome disparities. Closing General Session Celebration of the Radical Power of Nursing Sarah DiGregorio Sarah's experience of motherhood has been radically altered by the excellent care her family received from nurses. During her presentation, Sarah will describe how the practice of 3 nurses worked in her life and moved her to write about the radical power of nursing. She will trace the stories of nurses from the past to show how nursing is an ancient, powerful, and independent discipline that contains within it the progressive capacity for innovation and for justice through caring. How we care for one another—and how we care for caregivers—is central to our country's ability to move forward to a more just and healthy future.

    "abstract": "In the Practice Improvements in Neonatal Care section of Advances in Neonatal Care (ANC), we encourage authors, novice as well as experienced, to share manuscripts that are fundamental to neonatal nursing practice. Let's start with what is fundamental. What you do daily is fundamental to the care you provide to your patients? Practice improvement and quality improvement are the “combined and unceasing efforts of everyone in the caregiving setting to make changes that will lead to better patient outcomes, better system performance, and better professional learning.1,2 This is the responsibility of all healthcare providers. One of which is you, each one of you. Quality improvement can be related to new caregiving protocols you have learned or experienced. Questions you can ask your team are as follows: “What evidence has shaped the way you provide care?” “Have you made a recent change to your policies?” “What is your unit implementing that has benefited patients?” “What is your unit implementing that is unique, or not so unique, but has had a positive impact or unpredicted outcome?” “What is a concept or disease process that you have difficulty grasping?” “What better way to gain further understanding of that disease process than to write about it?” Educating each other is a fantastic way to learn ourselves, actually one of the best. This means content within this section is not limited to what is defined as solely a quality improvement initiative. Any topic that is fundamental to neonatal intensive caregiving is suitable for this section of the journal. As nurses we are constantly mindful of safety risks, how to minimize these risks, and prevent errors or events from occurring. Nurses are uniquely positioned to anticipate potential events1 (you know that gut feeling). Who better to provide information to our profession than the nursing providers at the bedside? We need to ask whether this is the best we can do? Is this practice or caregiving protocol in the context of person-centered care and are the experiences of the neonates and their parents used to guide how the practice is implemented. It is important to remember that real outcome measures in healthcare are not what immediately happens but what the neonates and their family experiences over the course of their life because of their time spent in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).1 Numerous quality improvement initiatives have been developed in the NICU setting. Some of these topics are as follows: Pain assessment Reduction of central line–associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) Prevention of sepsis Prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) Hand hygiene Mother–infant interactions Human milk nutrition Prevention of unplanned extubations Management of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) Prevention and management of hypothermia Magnetic resonance imaging without sedation Use of music therapy3 In addition, there are many processes that take place on an hourly, daily, and weekly basis that require standardization, care bundles, checklists, or even pathophysiological explanations relating to their use and development.1 There are diverse topics that you can share your learned experiences on: Improving our practice, by providing general information updates, reviews of the pathophysiology of a disease process, pharmacology principles of a specific medication, or pathophysiology of a certain disease process. Concept analysis of ideas central to neonatal nursing. You may have written one of these during your educational endeavors. To be publishable, you need to make sure the concept analysis is applicable in the real world. Clinical excellence related to specific problems. What has your unit been doing well that had had a positive effect on patient outcomes or that has positively affected parental satisfaction or participation. Descriptions of essential nursing care strategies for specific diagnosis. Neonatal concepts that pertain to all levels of nursing from the novice to the expert or targeted to a specific audience such as the new staff nurse or the advanced practice nurse. Quality improvement projects that promote practice and process improvement. Neonatal assessment processes. Consider your own units. What is occurring that concerns you? What has been helpful? Look at the effects of the implementation of new care bundles, new equipment, new staffing models, or environmental issues. Work with the unit leadership when something new is implemented in your unit, equipment, practice bundle, or medication. Have you initiated a new task force? Document the effects of this practice. As NICU care provider, you are uniquely positioned to have a positive and lasting effect on the care provided in your institution. Share this with your colleagues. Pat yourselves on the back for the outstanding work you do and care you provide to our tiny patients and their families. We want to use this section of ANC to capture the excellence of neonatal care that you are providing. Your unique educational and experiential viewpoints and your lived experiences are valuable. We look forward to reading your manuscripts. Many resources are available to assist you on this quest. These are in your units, hospitals, national associations, and this editorial board. Share your knowledge with our readers so that they may gain new knowledge that will enrich and expand their clinical knowledge and continue to improve the care we provide for our tiny precious patients.

    "abstract": "Five years ago, we wrote an editorial about the goals of individualized developmental care and the implementation challenges neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) face even when established care guidelines exist, in light of the fact that the evidence for many interventions were still lacking.1 Existing barriers included healthcare system structures that did not support delivery of developmentally focused care. For example, despite the knowledge that high noise levels are stressful for both infants and parents, many alarm systems do not inform caregivers without also creating significant noise. Since that first editorial, significant empirical evidence highlights the value of integrated family-centered developmental care interventions for both high-risk infants and their familes2–4; yet, NICUs continue to struggle to fully implement this important care. For example, evidence of the importance of zero separation of infants from their families now exists.2,4 Currently, the lack of full implementation of integrated family-centered developmental care is frequently blamed on the COVID-19 pandemic.5–8 At the height of the pandemic, parent access to the NICU was significantly limited. Yet, even today parental presence in the NICU is limited by nursery policies, COVID-19 quarantine protocols, and structural determinants such as lack of access to affordable transportation. Parents may need to care for other children who are not able to attend school or day care because of COVID-19 exposures or illness. Even when parent presence in the NICU is unhindered by COVID-19, they may not be able to afford to be with their infant as frequently or as long as they would prefer because of their job requirements or transportation costs. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to nurse burnout, stress, and staff shortages.9,10 Short-staffed NICUs create morale distress for nurses who cannot deliver the high quality of care they know the infants and families deserve.11 Regardless, even when parents are present in the nursery, staff may not have the time to support parents' informational, emotional, and physical needs. The term “missed care” is often used to refer to care that is not, but should be, delivered. Missed care in the NICU often includes the provision of integrated family-centered care and was present prior to the pandemic12 and is related to nurse job enjoyment and their plans to leave the NICU.13 To ensure nurses can deliver the care they know is essential for the infants and families, hospital health systems must support workload assessment that includes these important aspects of caregiving.14 Every neonatal nurse knows that it takes more time to teach and support a parent to provide caregiving to perform that caregiving themselves. Yet, parental presence and participation in the health care decision making and delivery of care are essential to parental confidence in their caregiving and decreasing infant hospital stay. Parents must be acknowledged as an important aspect of the caregiving team, potentially the most important aspect, given their long-term impact on the growth and development of the infant. Over the past 2 years, we have all seen the power of the voice of nurses. It is now time to raise our voices for ourselves and the infants and families we serve. We must advocate at the national level for standardized staffing levels that allow for the appropriated delivery of care and polices that ensure that parental presence is not compromised on the basis of racial and structural determinants of health. While zero separation may seem like an unreasonable and unobtainable goal, if we don't have such a goal we will not begin to move the needle toward a more optimal setting that supports the growth and development of infants and their families. Therefore, given the importance of the provision of integrated family-centered care, nurses must be afforded the time to ensure they can have effective interactions with families, deliver developmental interventions and parent teaching, and maintain ongoing relationships with families over the course of the hospital stay. —Debra Brandon, PhD, RN, CCNS, FAAN Co-Editor; Advances in Neonatal Care [email protected] —Jacqueline M.

    "abstract": "Background: Newborn falls are a safety concern in the acute care setting. To our knowledge, a valid and reliable tool for assessing newborn fall risk has not been developed. Purpose: To evaluate the content validity and interrater reliability of a tool for nurses to assess the fall risk of newborns in the acute care setting. Methods: Content validity was established using a modified Delphi technique with neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) nurses (n = 27). Item-level content validity indices and an average scale content validity index were calculated. For interrater reliability, pairs (n = 130) of NICU nurses simultaneously assessed multiple newborns using the tool, and an intraclass correlation coefficient was calculated. Results: The initial tool had 28 items classified in 2 sections (newborn and caregiver variables). Fourteen items met predefined cut-off values for content validity. This resulted in the tool (KAnt Fall) having 7 items for assessing newborns and 7 items for caregivers. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.99 indicating excellent interrater reliability. Implications for Practice: The tool will help assist nurses in systematically identifying newborns at high risk for falls. This assessment will allow nurses to identify and implement timely preventive actions for hospitalized newborns at high risk for falls. Implications for Research: Since this was a single-center study in 1 NICU, future research is needed in other hospitals and types of newborn settings (eg, labor and delivery and postpartum units). Further testing of KAnt Fall is also needed to establish additional psychometric properties.",

    "abstract": "The benefits of feeding mother's own milk (MOM) to preterm and critically ill infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for improved health are well established and include a decreased incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis, late-onset sepsis, retinopathy of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and neurodevelopmental delays.1–3 Earlier this year, the American Academy of Pediatrics released their updated policy on Breastfeeding and the use of Human Milk, which recommends exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months and continued breastfeeding for 2 years and beyond.4 However, for infants born preterm or critically ill, less than 20% receive any MOM at 6 months and this limited exposure is most often due to insufficient milk production by their mothers.5,6 Furthermore, significant racial disparities exist regarding preterm birth, provision of MOM, and health outcomes. Black women have a 2.6× greater risk of delivering a preterm infant than White, non-Hispanic women, are 7.6× less likely to provide MOM to their infant, and their infants are at highest risk of complications, which may be mitigated by consumption of MOM.7–9 Since the 2012 American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation that preterm infants be fed donor human milk (DHM) when MOM is unavailable, the use of DHM has become standard care in most NICUs.10,11 Although DHM and MOM are often considered interchangeable, evidence clearly supports the superiority of MOM in terms of protection against prematurity-related complications.12,13 Pasteurization of DHM reduces and/or eliminates many of the protective elements, including immunoglobulins, cytokines, and growth factors, as well as destroys the commensal microbiota.14,15 Furthermore, due to diminished protein content and decreased fat absorption from inactivation of bile salt-stimulating lipase by pasteurization, infants fed DHM are at risk for suboptimal growth.16,17 Finally, some studies suggest that the availability of DHM in NICUs may reduce MOM consumption in preterm infants.18 Thus, our focus should clearly be on increasing the amount of MOM consumed by infants in the NICU and this requires a systematic, multidisciplinary approach beginning antenatally and including both maternal and neonatal services. It is well known that milk production in the first days postpartum is closely associated with the amount produced at 6 weeks and infants whose mother comes to volume (production of at least 500 mL of MOM by day 14 postpartum) are 11× more likely to be receiving MOM at NICU discharge.19 Thus, strategies to increase MOM production must begin immediately after delivery and focus on the first 14 days postpartum including initiation of expression soon after delivery and frequent MOM expression using an appropriate breast pump. Initiation of milk expression should begin as soon as possible following delivery and no later than 6 hours postpartum.20 However, mothers delivering critically ill and/or preterm infants, often have underlying comorbidities and deliver via cesarean section making maternal self-initiated expression difficult. Because mothers often require extensive support to express, initiation is often delayed due to insufficient time and available staff.21 To facilitate timely expression initiation, it is possible that following a brief education session, the mother's support person could provide expression assistance.22 Because mothers delivering infants requiring NICU admission are often hospitalized for days prior to delivery, this education could take place antenatally. However, beginning expression soon after delivery is not sufficient to establish a mother's milk supply. Frequent expression during the initial few days following delivery and through the first 14 days postpartum is also essential.19,23 Unfortunately, due to perceived maternal acuity and exhaustion, nursing time constraints, and lack of information regarding the importance of early frequent expression, mothers often express much less frequently than required to initiate lactation. The first 3 to 5 days are a critical window during which decreased expression frequency is associated with decreased long-term milk volume.19 It is necessary that both mothers and staff understand the potential negative effects of missed expression sessions on both short- and long-term milk production and make informed decisions based on this information. It is also possible that an appropriately trained support person could provide expression assistance as needed until the mothers have sufficiently recovered to independently express. Finally, it is imperative that mothers have access to hospital-grade breast pumps beginning with one being available in her recovery and postpartum room to avoid delays or interruptions in expression. Unfortunately, mothers are often discharged home before obtaining an appropriate pump for home use and are thus dependent upon hand pumps or battery-operated breasts pumps. These types of pumps are inadequate for providing the necessary breast stimulation and milk removal needed to promote adequate lactation in the early days postpartum. It is therefore necessary that systems are developed to provide mothers of infants in the NICU with hospital-grade breast pumps prior to their discharge home. Nurses are uniquely positioned to lead and facilitate lactation support programs, which optimize lactation success consistent with a mother's stated goals. It is essential that nurses who care for infants admitted to the NICU and/or their mothers create and support an environment conducive to lactation and utilize evidence-based strategies to optimize milk production in mothers of critically ill and preterm infants. These efforts are necessary to facilitate increased MOM production, reduce the need for DHM, and increase the likelihood that sufficient quantities of MOM are available for infant consumption thus improving health outcomes of vulnerable infants in the NICU. —Leslie A.

    "abstract": "I appreciated the thoughtful and balanced editorial by Brittaney L. Kyle, BSN, RNC-NIC, and Donna A. Dowling, PhD, RN, addressing the importance of inclusive language when caring for families in the neonatal intensive care unit. This is such an important topic in our efforts to promote equitable environments for patients, families, visitors, and staff in healthcare settings. I appreciated the focus on purposeful inclusion and specifically the use of gender-neutral language and the trauma-informed use of each individual's identified personal pronouns and reference words associated with parenting. This is essential in creating a welcoming and inclusive environment in our perinatal and neonatal care settings. I want to add one additional consideration regarding personal pronouns. The pronouns that each individual uses in reference to themselves are their pronouns. Asking someone their preferred pronouns is considered by many to be a triggering, trauma-insensitive microaggression that suggests each of us has a pronoun that is consistent with our sex assigned at birth, our physical characteristics or appearance, or something else but would prefer a different pronoun be used. In addition, if that question is asked to only some individuals some of the time rather than to everyone, every time, the question itself suggests an assumption or judgment based on some observable characteristic that implies the individual is “other” than one assumed to be cisgender/gender-normative. An individual's pronouns can most respectfully and simply be learned by the inclusive approach of introducing yourself to parents and family members (and others) with your name and pronouns and asking about theirs. “Hi I'm Kyle, baby Sam and family's nurse today. My pronouns are she/her. How may I address you that will be most comfortable?” is just one of many approaches. The editorial makes many additional recommendations for promoting inclusivity in this care setting, especially noting the structural and naming conventions that have been long a part of perinatal care, but are insensitive and “othering” for many and can be triggering and deeply traumatic. Knowing our families, and individualizing our care including appropriate use of inclusive language, is important and highlighting it in this editorial with balance and perspective was welcome. —Katherine L.

    "abstract": "We want to thank Katherine L. Criswell, MSN, RN, for the thoughtful comments provided in response to our editorial and for continuing the conversation concerning the use of inclusive language. Intent and impact are not always aligned, and this is an opportunity for us to learn and grow. Criswell's points are welcomed and valued. Referring to personal pronouns instead of one's “preferred” pronouns is critical, especially as the identities that individuals experience over the course of their lives are not always personally preferred. The neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is a high-intensity environment for families and healthcare team members. In such stressful situations, resources are warranted for nurses and all allied professions to be prepared to support trauma-informed care. We must continually strive to enact trauma-informed healthcare practices in the NICU.1 All health professionals can and should advocate for systems improvement to create a more welcoming environment for the patients and families we serve. Using language that supports and validates individuals and families is one of the simplest and easiest ways we can show respect and increase inclusion. The use of inclusive language as standard practice in the NICU introduces a change in our approaches to communicating with families, and we agree that, in order to reflect a culture of inclusion, it is essential that healthcare providers in the NICU give careful consideration as to how this change is implemented so that at all families “get the same message,” not just families selected on the basis of assumptions. This will happen if the people providing the message are actively involved in the planning of this change, rather than being told this is what they must do, especially when the use of the correct terminology is emphasized; fear of not using correct gender-neutral language may result in reluctance to participate in these conversations. One of the critical considerations in the planning of this change is consideration of when to initiate the discussion of the use of personal pronouns with families. For some families, this may be during initial introductions. However, as neonatal nurses, every interaction we have contains within it a potential for either benefit or harm and introducing a topic that is not immediately relevant to a family has the potential for adding to the stress of having a critically ill infant. One approach to avoiding this may be encouraging healthcare facilities to incorporate pronoun indicators on name badges, which can help normalize conversations regarding pronouns and other gendered terminology.2 This indirect approach includes the benefits of actively involving the staff as well as giving the parent the opportunity to “control” the timing of the conversation. Another approach could be providing written materials that describe the NICU's commitment to inclusion in general and encourage parents to discuss gender-neutral language with the infant's caregivers. The parent(s)' responses can be documented and accessed in the medical record, allowing for consistent adherence among healthcare team members. Making this discussion routine, it becomes a normal part of our introductions to families and thus more natural and comfortable to the participants involved. —Donna A.

    "abstract": "INDIRECT IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC CAUSED BY COVID-19: CALLING FOR STORIES FROM THE NANN MEMBERS! From March 24 to April 20, 2020, the first round of global online survey was conducted by the partnership of multiple international groups coordinated by the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium, to explore the indirect impact of the pandemic on maternal and newborn healthcare and on healthcare professionals.1 Their researchers stated on the basis of the previous experience of past major outbreaks: “The Pandemic's indirect effects will likely surpass the direct infection effects on women and newborns.” The second round of the survey was completed between July and December 2020, and data for the third round is currently being collected at the time of this writing. Future publications are awaited. The survey was offered in 12 languages to collect information and to synthesize both the voices and experiences of global frontline healthcare professionals in the early stages of COVD-19 pandemic. Respondents (N = 714) from 81 countries (63% from high-income countries [HICs]) included nurses, midwives, community health workers, physicians, medical students/trainees, and others. Nearly half of the respondents were either nurse or nurse-midwives. A total of 87 participated from North America. The majority of those responding (90%) reported to have received information regarding COVID-19, including the transmission route, preventive measures, or treatment. One-third reported they were offered simulation exercises. Half of the respondents from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and 82% of those from HICs reported that they received updates on guidelines. Most (92%), however, made personal efforts to search for the updated COVID-19 information. Some were concerned about lack of national recommendations as of April 2020. Respondents reported that various measures were implemented globally in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including setting up screening policies with signs posted to indicate the methods/locations of screening, or reserving isolation rooms for possible positive cases. Eighty-three percent of the HIC-based respondents reported isolation rooms were available versus 57% for LMIC-based respondents. The ability to order COVID-19 tests for maternity patients prior to the delivery of the neonates was 23% for LMICs versus 61% for HICs. The personal protective equipment (PPE) availabilities were also higher for those in HICs. Regardless of resource differences, both groups reported similarly that they experienced a “somewhat” or “substantially” higher level of stress than usual (91% vs 89%, respectively). Respondents felt that PPE created barriers in communicating with patients. Facial expressions and human warmth through touch are essential tools to express comfort, sympathy, empathy, or encouragement. Some expressed the sadness for families who lost learning “time” from the nurses or midwives in face-to-face settings. Others voiced worsening challenges due to decrease in available staff members from isolation or quarantine measures. Lockdown measures adopted by countries and cities caused challenges for some professionals and patients, making commuting long distances difficult, challenging patients' access to receive outpatient care. All of these placed an additional burden on the front line with implications for the quality of care. Great concern was expressed regarding the maternal–infant separation when COVID-19–positive mothers were denied skin-to-skin care or direct breastfeeding for their infants. Others reported early discharges postbirth (as early as 6-8 hours) and expressed concerns for mothers and infants going home with insufficient feeding experiences, education, or support. One obstetrical national association in Eastern Europe recommended banning of partners or doulas from attending any births altogether, distressing healthcare professionals. Semaan and colleagues1 discuss extensively with existing evidence that banning visitors, denying family presence, or denying direct breastfeeding all potentially jeopardizes the well-being of the families and infants. In response to what was occurring, the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine questioned the practice of separation of infants from COVID-19–positive mothers and emphasized the established breastfeeding benefits for a long-term well-being.2 The American Academy of Pediatrics updated the earlier recommendations and now encourages COVID-19 mothers to continue to breastfeed or room-in with their child with certain precautions, such as performing hand hygiene and wearing a mask while breastfeeding.3 Darcy Mahoney and colleagues4 conducted a US-based survey in late April to examine the impact of restrictions on parental presence in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The authors reported that nearly half of the NICUs that responded (N = 277) had restricted parental entry to NICUs (less restrictions for single-room NICUs), with the majority allowing only one parent at the bedside.4 The overall decrease in NICUs with 24-hour parental presence in response to the pandemic is concerning (83% down to 53%). Parental involvement during medical rounds was also noted to be decreased regardless of single-room or multibed settings, suggesting an increased barrier for family's direct engagement with the care team as well as for opportunities for shared decision-making for their child in the NICU. Nearly half of the responding NICUs experienced reduction in at least one of the critical services including developmental care (occupational/physical/speech therapies), social work, or lactation consultants. The researchers raise concerns about the potential long-term or lifelong ill effects on both infants and their families. Ahmad and colleagues5 conducted serial surveys to explore the burden of pandemic on NICUs and evolving care practice policies over time. The survey periods were March 26-April 3, April 8-19, May 5-22, and July 13-August 2 (number of participating NICUs at each round: 153, 160, 165, and 148, respectively). This is the only published study at the time of this writing that contains data beyond the early stages of the pandemic. At the time of this study, reported confirmed cases of neonatal COVID-19 were minimal (maximum of 0.4% NICU inpatient population). Various care aspects changed over time. Isolation/separation of infants from COVID-19–positive mothers for 14 days declined from the second round to the fourth round of data collection (from 46% to 20%). There was a gradual increase from the second round to the fourth round in the number of NICUs where COVID-19–positive mothers are allowed to directly breastfeed (17%, 21%, and 47%). The number of cites allowing the infants to room-in with their COVID-19–positive mothers also increased from the second round to the fourth round (from 14% to 50%). These authors also expressed concerns that the indirect effects of COVID-19 may impact bonding and long-term breastfeeding success; thus, both short- and long-term impacts of pandemic-led practice changes must continue to be studied over time. Neonatal nurses are in a position to recognize the indirect impact of COVID-19 and to advocate for the needs of the vulnerable infants and their families. Some NANN members are implementing innovative strategies to maximize parent–infant time together including encouraging discouraged mothers and fathers who are often not allowed to visit together to find ways to share their time using technologies such as Zoom and serving on the institutional COVID-19 committee to provide a nursing perspective. COVID-19 changed how nurses practice; however, it will not change our commitment to improve the neonatal/family outcomes.

Extended hospitalization in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) causes missed opportunities for language exposure at critical developmental periods of neural pathways for language processing. Healthcare providers (HCPs), particularly nurses, may be instrumental in providing infant-directed speech to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes.To evaluate current evidence to determine what is known about the characteristics of HCP communication to infants in the NICU.Four databases and forward searching were used to respond to the clinical question: \"What is known about the characteristics of HCP communication to infants in the NICU?\" Empiric, primary research studies published in English without date restriction were included.Eight studies, primarily descriptive, were reviewed. Overall, infant-directed speech was rarely provided by HCPs. Language was more often directed to sicker infants, occurred in contexts of procedural pain, and was sometimes combined with touch. Perceptions of language by nurses, infants, and parents as well as inhibitors and benefits of infant-directed speech were reported.As frontline neonatal providers, nurses can serve as role models of infant-directed speech for parents, helping them gain comfort and understand the importance of speaking to their preterm infants. Nurses can also provide much-needed language nutrition to preterm infants when parents cannot be present.Methods to reduce barriers and support infant-directed speech in the NICU require testing. Predictive modeling using measures of language exposure in the NICU may support differences in neurodevelopmental outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Background: Premature neonates require assisted heating devices for thermoregulation in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Traditional use of a cloth blanket and cloth towels during peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) placement may hinder heat transfer from the assisted heating mechanisms, increasing the risk for neonatal hypothermia. Purpose: This quality improvement project's goal was to reduce the hypothermia rate in very low birth-weight (VLBW) neonates by replacing cloth blanket/towels with a plastic drape during PICC placement. Methods: The FOCUS-PDSA method was used to implement the intervention (plastic drape) over 3 months, during 58 PICC procedures in a level 3 NICU. A pre-/posttest design was used to evaluate the impact of the intervention on hypothermia rates compared with a baseline cloth group and a concurrent cloth cohort. Results: After the 3-month implementation period, the hypothermia rate for the intervention group was lower than that for the baseline cloth group (5.2% and 11.3%, respectively), but this difference was not statistically significant. Post-PICC hypothermia rates were significantly lower for the intervention group than for the concurrent cloth cohort ( P = .004). Implications for Practice: Preliminary evidence demonstrated the plastic drape reduced the hypothermia rate in the NICU for VLBW neonates during PICC placement compared with cloth blanket/towels. A plastic drape shows promise in improving nursing practice by providing improved thermoregulation for premature neonates during PICC placement. Implications for Research: Further research is recommended to replicate findings with larger samples of PICC insertions, using a plastic drape in the operating room and other NICU procedures.",

IT'S A MOVEMENT Gigi Khonyongwa-Fernandez, MSc, ACC; Jennifer Degl, MS; Deb Discenza, MA; Wakako Eklund, DNP, APN, NNP-BC As parents of former neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) infants and parent leaders in the neonatal community, racial and health equity is more than just a news item to us. Even before the racial justice upheaval in 2020, NICU parents recognized a need for action on these issues. Parent-led efforts are beginning to make an impact within neonatal care initiatives. Within this section, 3 parents share personal experiences, often raw and painful, to urge the neonatal nursing community to increase actions, whether in research, quality improvement initiatives, or policy, to propel the work forward by enhanced collaboration with mutual trust and understanding. GIGI I was born in Tuskegee, Alabama, 2 years before the infamous syphilis study ended.1,2 The US Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called the affected individuals “test subjects” and viewed them as a group of poor, Black, uneducated sharecroppers. These participants could be easily studied because they did not know the right questions to ask. The Tuskegee study and its impact were real in my life growing up, as we personally knew some of the so-called “test subjects.” We knew them as Mr Pollard, Mr Shaw, and my maternal grandmother's cousin Mr Hawkins, who had families, hopes, and dreams. These individuals and their families and descendants, as well as the trajectory of my entire community, were permanently altered because of the aggression and discriminatory clinical practices committed by reputable and trusted predominantly White institutions. There were many adverse effects of this 6-month turned 40-year study, which continues today. Unfortunately, distrust in any efforts associated with research and clinical trials remains a part of the deeply woven fabric not only in the Tuskegee community but also in entire Black communities nationally and even globally. Strong suspicions or beliefs that researchers use “clinical trials” as a facade for personal/professional gain and to harm the “subjects” are deeply embedded in the minds of many in 2021. Although I left Tuskegee many years ago and have lived, worked in, and traveled across the United States, as well as the globe, currently residing in London, England, the impact of Tuskegee still lingers. The hypotheses of this study assumed a lot. The assumptions benefited and/or justified the conduct of research and not the people who were participants. Similar assumptions were projected onto me as this brown-skinned NICU mother. Despite my professional background in senior healthcare management, and my ability to articulate and advocate for myself, I intuitively felt the urge to fight off these often-silent assumptions throughout my child's NICU stay. During the almost 6 months-long NICU stay, I vividly remember watching our surviving 24-week twin constantly fight for his life. I was aware that a clinical trial was occurring in our NICU and they were enrolling patients to explore the relationship between formula feeds, cow milk sensitivity, and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). The primary investigator (PI) of the study saw and walked past me daily in the NICU. On occasion, she looked me in the eye but never addressed or acknowledged me for 2½ months, until my son developed NEC and underwent surgical procedure for resection and colostomy, thereby becoming a potential candidate for her study. Her nonacknowledgment of me prior to this stood out because the other neonatologists spoke to me frequently. When the PI finally spoke to me to discuss her study, she was surprised that I was a “professional” who was educated and articulate. The historically common, and often unchallenged, assumption that a Black person is uninformed, uneducated, and unintelligible likely hindered the PI to see who I truly was. The misconceptions of me continued after I said I would “consider” participating in the study. For a few weeks afterward, she made a beeline to me daily upon entering the NICU, looking for my consent. She assumed I had said “yes” and expected a signed consent immediately. This is a common occurrence for Black NICU parents, in that our spoken words are often not heard. An avoidable distrust unfortunately grew in my heart, similar to occurrences likely found in many NICUs globally. Although an incredibly complex, multilayered, and sensitive issue, racial and health equity is a concept that can be changed but it will take a comprehensive, meaningful, transparent, and non–sugar-coated approach. This multidimensional approach is one that I also embrace as a NICU Parent Leader. No one perspective, person, or organization can solve this issue on its own. We need to realize that addressing the racial inequality in the NICU is not just the issue of the families feeling the inequality but this is everyone's issue as well. A few suggestions to begin this process are as follows: Be willing to change. Otherwise, why bother? Implement continuous Unconscious Bias training. This cannot be a tick-box exercise but one that has a real, impactful, and measurable outcome. Start on an equal and level playing field by recognizing that all entities, the care providers, researchers, and NICU parents are offering expertise. Be honest, empathetic, inclusive, and transparent. These qualities are self-explanatory, however, a key to show parents unbiased evidence of them being manifested. Exhibit active, compassionate, and respectful engagement and listening. Listen to hear and not just to respond. A key point to remember is the importance of engaging and building a genuine relationship with parents BEFORE you seek their support for your study, research, or projects. There are many more recommendations to consider, but these are a few. If focused efforts are made, we can fundamentally change the way the neonatal community engage with underrepresented NICU families, once and for all. DEB As a woman who grew up with very dark olive-toned skin and stood out in every classroom and every playground, I have incredible respect, empathy, and love for the African American community. As an adult and as a new mother in the NICU with my 30-weeker daughter, Becky, I saw firsthand the White as well as socioeconomic privileges I had in being able to buy my own breast pump and provide my daughter with breast milk expressed in a private office, to craft my own maternity plan and more. My daughter benefited from excellent access to the best doctors. But as I grew as a parent leader in the NICU parents' community, I saw the challenges minority NICU families had, and I was horrified. Year after year, I raised my voice at coalition meetings and conferences both at state and national levels that we White parents did not represent the full NICU population and much work was needed. Speaking up did little because nothing was done other than to acknowledge the problem. Fast Forward to May 2020 and with the horrific murder of George Floyd, I saw a serious shift in how our country responded to systemic racism. I realized that my time should be spent effecting changes in my own community. What started as an informal alliance grew into a full nonprofit organization—the Alliance for Black NICU Families.4 But as a White woman of privilege, I realized the mirroring of unity was so important. I was honored and privileged that Ashley Randolph of GLO Preemies agreed to be my cofounder and our President.4 Little did I know that the formation of the Alliance would also have a far-reaching impact just a few short months into existence when I introduced myself as a co-Parent Leader of the Leadership Team for the International Neonatal Consortium (INC),5 which NANN has been actively engaged since INC's inception. As an organization that seeks to bring together stakeholders toward driving therapy development and needed research in neonates, the team was instantly interested in the Alliance and how INC could do its own part. The October 2020 INC meeting, which drew participants from various global regions, included a robust Racial and Health Equity session with multistakeholder panelists. As of early 2021, INC stakeholders approved and enthusiastically supported a Racial & Healthy Equity in Clinical Trials workgroup to continue the work. JENNIFER I am a mother of four. My youngest is a micro preemie who was born at 23 weeks gestation in 2012, weighting only 1 pound 4 ounces. We both almost lost our lives. I needed more than 30 units of blood to survive my daughter's delivery due to my advanced case of placenta percreta, and my infant spent 121 days in the NICU. We are both lucky to be alive. My daughter endured more medical interventions than most healthy adults will experience in their lifetimes. She participated in 2 clinical trials that helped her thrive. I consented to these without hesitation because I trusted the medical team. Because of our top-notch medical care, I survived a life-threatening pregnancy and delivery and have since become an advocate for maternal and neonatal healthcare. I serve on the boards of various professional organizations that contribute to the future success of mothers and infants. We experienced exceptional healthcare and were given opportunities to participate in cutting-edge medicine that saved our lives. Unfortunately, not every NICU infant is afforded the same opportunities and not every parent will consent to a clinical trial. Could this be because the approach is tone-deaf to what that family is going through, such as socioeconomic challenges? Is there a lack of trust among different races or backgrounds due to historic or current events? These are the questions that we must ask before we strategize toward racial and health equity for all infants and families. This is why Deb and I are thrilled that the INC has encouraged us to lead the Racial & Healthy Equity in Clinical Trials workgroup. It's time. While we find it heartening to see all of the efforts in this piece being taken seriously, we are fully aware of the “check box” mentality and how the efforts tend to be minimized, underfunded, and outright ignored all over again. With the spark of a moment, our society, including the neonatal community, has the opportunity to make real, long-term infrastructural changes. We will pass the test, if each of us in every community turns the moment into a lasting movement. Whether it is in research, policy, quality improvement, or education, actions are needed to propel the work further.",

    "abstract": "THE STATUS OF NEONATAL ORGAN AND TISSUE DONATION IN THE UNITED STATES According to the Health Resources & Services Administration Web site, organdonor.gov, more than 1900 children received transplants in 2019 and, currently, almost 2000 more younger than 18 years are on the national transplant waiting list.1 During the same time frame, about 900 children, the majority of whom fell in the 11 to 17 years age range, became organ donors.1 Of this group, 134 were infants younger than 1 year.2 The idea of neonatal organ and tissue donation is not a new one; however, it can be a difficult topic. Neonatal organ and tissue donation is rare despite the availability of guidelines for neonatal brain death criteria since 20123 and the establishment of the opportunity for neonatal donation after cardiac death in 2014.4 Presently, there are a growing number of families who ask about the possibility in an attempt to give meaning to a death that came too soon after birth.5 These donations can also help fill a crucial need as organ and tissue availability is not meeting the demand.6 Families are often told that organ and tissue donation is impossible. However, the neonatal donation of organs and tissues, when approached with careful attention to legal, ethical, medical, and procedural issues, and with the adequate support of healthcare professionals, can be done and have a significant role in the care of a family at the time of an infant's death.7 Because of limited experience with neonatal organ and tissue donation and discussions with families, there is a need for education for neonatal providers, medical examiners/coroners, and local organ procurement organizations (OPOs) on available guidelines and algorithms to ensure that potential opportunities for donation are not lost.6,8,9 Strict policies and criteria guide organ donation and transplantation. In the United States, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) manages organ procurement, donation, and transplantation while the private nonprofit United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) updates the national transplant list, maintains the transplant database, and monitors organ allocation.10 Individual organ transplant programs and all local OPOs in the United States are OPTN/UNOS members and are required to follow their policies.10 Also, all hospitals that participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs have been required to conduct timely referrals of all potential organ donors to their local OPOs since 1998.11 These hospitals must also inform all families of potential organ donors of their option to donate and to allow on-site OPO personnel trained in discussing the potential for organ donation. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) also supports the role of the OPOs in an approach to all potential organ donor families that includes trained individuals.12 The process of neonatal organ and tissue donation must also be guided by the ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice.10,13 The removal of organs should not cause the death of the donor, and the discussion or consideration of organ donation should be done separately from any end-of-life decisions.10 The medical team should focus on the management and well-being of the infant and support the decisions of the family, while a representative of the local OPO can initiate discussions with the family once decisions for goals of care have been made. The timing around these conversations with family can be tricky because there should be no appearance of conflict of interest; that is, that the best interests of a recipient are considered to be greater than that of the potential donor.10 But by the time the diagnosis of brain death is considered for a patient, the medical team should have already notified the OPO of the potential for organ donation and personnel should be on-site to initiate conversations regarding organ donation if the family has not already done so. This ensures that critical timing issues are balanced in order to allow for meeting both the families' needs for bonding at the end of the infant's life and the criteria for organ and tissue retrieval.5,10 Death is often thought to be the cessation of breathing and circulation and, indeed, the first organ transplants were determined by circulatory criteria (donation after circulatory determination of death [DCDD]).10 However, advancements in technology made it possible to sustain circulation indefinitely in a person with no brain function. Another criterion was needed, and in 1981, the US President's Commission released the Uniform Determination of Death Act that outlined the conditions for death based on either neurologic criteria or circulatory criteria. Since then, the majority of organ transplants have occurred after the donor has been declared brain dead (donation after brain death [DBD]).10 In this instance, the heart is beating until the moment of organ recovery. The APP has established criteria to standardize determination of brain death in infants who are 37 weeks' gestational age or greater.14 Still, less than 1% of organ or tissue donations come from donors who are younger than 1 year.2 Furthermore, strict criteria guide who can donate and what organs and tissues can be harvested under certain conditions.6 For example, neonates weighing less than 2 kg are not eligible for organ or tissue donation. Those infants who weigh more than 2 kg and die according to neurologic criteria are eligible for organ donation. While those infants who weigh more than 2 kg and die within 90 minutes following withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy are eligible for en bloc kidney and hepatocyte donation, as well as heart valve donation.6 There are other unique features of the neonatal population that may be affecting low rates of neonatal organ and tissue donation, such as improvements in pediatric cardiac surgery and critical care that have led to improved corrective and palliative procedures, as well as survival in previously lethal conditions.10 So, it may not be immediately clear whether an infant will die from his or her disease. Because of the inability to definitively predict an infant's illness trajectory, clinicians and families remain hopeful until every potential life-sustaining intervention has been exhausted. Furthermore, neonates, and by extension their parents, are considered a vulnerable population and paternalistic views of those who care for them have been well documented since the early 1980s.15 Those who care for them must weigh when to give distressing information and they may or may not advocate for their participation in research or other activities that are believed could cause potential emotional harm. Finally, because neonatal practitioners generally do not treat organ transplant recipients, they may have misconceptions about organ donation, lack familiarity with donation processes, and inexperience with discussions around the possibility of organ and tissue donation with families.7,10 While donation of neonatal organs and tissues to living recipients is relatively infrequent, the use of same for research purposes has been even less common. A lack of information about donation options exists in general, and researchers have not sought neonatal organs and tissues until recently as they have proven to be increasingly valuable for research into areas such as diabetes, organ system development, rheumatoid arthritis, pancreatic cancer, and pediatric emergency resuscitation.7 Donation of organs and tissues for research use is an option that can be considered for any neonatal organs and tissues that still meet defined criteria but are deemed nontransplantable. Three algorithms have been developed: (1) neonate delivered at term with a lethal anomaly; (2) neonate born preterm with a lethal anomaly; and (3) neonate who dies as a result of other conditions such as hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy or trauma.7 The International Institute for the Advancement of Medicine (IIAM) is one of the largest nonprofit organizations in the United States that can assist families, healthcare providers, and researchers in coordinating the placement of organs and tissues for use in research.5 No matter the ultimate use of the neonatal organ and tissues, parents should be given information about the possibility of donation. Many neonates who die in a neonatal intensive care unit would be eligible for DCDD, and making a decision to donate a gift that could save someone's life or contribute to scientific advancements may give parents some comfort in the midst of the tragic loss of their infant and become a vital component of their healing process.7,10 Raised awareness would also increase the overall number of organ and tissue donations as multiple recipients/research studies can often benefit from a single donation.7 Finally, clinicians, families, and researchers are reporting positive experiences with neonatal organ and tissue donation.5,7,8 Education for neonatologists, nurses, and other neonatal healthcare providers around the criteria and process of organ and tissue donation for this population, as well as communication with families, should be supported whenever possible.",

    "abstract": "WHAT NEONATAL NURSES SHOULD KNOW ABOUT REGIONALIZATION AND RISK-APPROPRIATE CARE Regionalization and the delivery of risk-appropriate care for women and infants are not new ideas. In fact, after marked improvements in outcomes and decreased mortality for infants were demonstrated through neonatal care in the 1960s and the 1970s, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists joined forces with the March of Dimes to put forward recommendations that supported regionalization of care to increase access to neonatal intensive care services for high-risk patients. Their 1976 report, “Toward Improving the Outcome of Pregnancy”1 established a model for regionalization of care and the basis for the level of care designations that are still assigned to neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) today, as well as to inform public policy.1,2 Initially, there were 3 levels: level 1 hospitals offered obstetrical services without services to newborns; level 2 hospitals provided nursing care to infants who were ill but did not require an intensive care environment; and level 3 hospitals had NICUs that cared for the smallest and sickest infants. Most states widely implemented regional perinatal care coordination systems based on levels of care, and pregnant women who were at risk for preterm delivery were transferred antenatally to hospitals with NICUs that could provide the appropriate level of care.3 Regulation of the process was maintained by state certificate of need laws and overseen by state-designated regulatory agencies. Although each state operated a bit differently, the agencies were critical in establishing and monitoring services within a regionalized system.4 Over the next decade, studies showed that this model was successful through continued improvement in neonatal outcomes and lower rates of infant mortality.5,6 But, in spite of the data, the late 1980s and the 1990s saw a deregionalization of care because of managed care,7 changing state reimbursement systems,7 increasing technology, a spike in the number of neonatologists (1.7, 1.8, and 2.3 times the number in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, respectively),8 further embrace of the role of the neonatal nurse practitioner, and models of care that encouraged community hospitals in some parts of the United States to add NICU services in order to compete for patients.2,9,10 These factors caused a shift in where high-risk infants were born2 and significant variations in outcomes and mortality rates both among NICUs and at birth hospitals were soon seen, even after adjusting for severity of illness.11 A meta-analysis of published literature from 1978 to 2010 showed that infants who “received care at higher level facilities had higher rates of survival than those who received care at lower level facilities.”12 The influence of birth location has been demonstrated for other important outcomes, as well. For example, asphyxiated infants born in level 1 centers and transferred for hypothermia treatment have a higher incidence of adverse outcome and brain injury than infants born in level 3 centers13; the risk for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia is higher for infants born in level 2 centers than in higher-level centers14; poor neurodevelopmental outcomes are significantly higher in infants born outside of tertiary perinatal centers15; and mortality associated with necrotizing enterocolitis is highest for infants who are cared for in lower-level NICUs.16 It is clear that to achieve the best outcomes, infants must receive care in centers that have been organized according to their capabilities and include the resources and personnel who can provide care that is appropriate for each infant. It is also clear that the more a certain type of care is provided, the better a center becomes at providing that care. This is supported by the AAP in a 2012 policy statement that expanded definitions of levels of neonatal care and was promoted jointly with the AGOG in Guidelines for Perinatal Care.17,18 Now, characteristics of 4 levels of care were defined: level 1: basic care; level 2: specialty care; level 3: subspecialty care; and level 4: regional perinatal health care centers.17,18 The levels range from the most basic newborn nursery to regional centers that are capable for caring for the most critical infants. The pendulum is currently swinging back toward regionalization. And where once this model focused primarily on infant care (care for mothers was included but separate), now coordinated care of high-risk mothers and infants is a major focus in response to increasing levels of maternal morbidity and mortality.19,20 A regionalized system of perinatal care with integrated delivery of services should address the care of the mother before and after pregnancy, the management of labor and delivery, postpartum care, and neonatal care.17 Furthermore, it is important to note that maternal and neonatal levels of care do not need to match, but rather both mothers and infants should receive care in centers where both of their needs be met best.21 However, levels of neonatal care and the monitoring of these levels continue to vary widely between states and regions. A 2019 systematic review of publicly available information on levels of neonatal care designation including certificate of need laws found that only 31 of the 50 states have an authority identified to designate level of care with varying processes, and more than half of the states that do have a designating authority allow facilities to self-designate with no direct oversight.22 Although there are definitions for care-level designations, this lack of oversight and an inconsistency between state risk-appropriate care policies with the 2012 AAP policy statement have implications that have the potential to affect standardization of care by facility level, which could ultimately affect neonatal outcomes.23 To address the lack of oversight and inconsistencies, professional clinical organizations such as the AAP have developed “NICU Verification” programs that utilize experienced and credentialed neonatologists, neonatal nurses, and pediatric surgeons who are active in practice to review a NICU to verify whether it meets the requirements described in their state's rules, as well as the standards outlined by the AAP for specific levels of care.24 Each level of care describes the minimal capabilities and the provider types (physicians, nurse practitioners, pediatric medical subspecialists) that are required for designation. Furthermore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has developed and published the Web-based Level of Care Assessment Tool (LOCATe) to assist local public health departments in determining both the maternal and neonatal levels of care at facilities within their jurisdictions that are based upon national guidelines.21,25 What is not clear is how the contributions of neonatal staff nurses are considered in the level designation process even though they are responsible for much of the care that an infant receives in the NICU. Quality of nursing care is related to several important patient outcomes, such as infection rates.26 And hospitals with Magnet status have been associated with better outcomes for very low birth-weight infants, including mortality and several intraventricular hemorrhage.27 While missed nursing care, which is related to nurse workload, is associated with poorer infant outcomes.28 The Guidelines for Perinatal Care recognize the importance of multidisciplinary care and recommend that each facility determine the scope of practice that is required for each nursing unit and specialty department.18 However, what this looks like and how nursing expertise is actually measured as a factor in level determination is unclear. Currently, state laws, the verification body, and the individual surveyor determine whether the nursing education, competencies, and care are adequate for the level designation. Tami Wallace, DNP, APRN, NNP-BC, is one of several surveyors who are committed to doing this very important work. With more than 30 years of clinical experience in every level of neonatal care from staff and transport nurse to nurse educator, to nurse practitioner, to quality improvement coordinator, Dr Wallace thinks deeply about regionalization, risk-appropriate care, and how nursing expertise may be better delineated throughout the level designation process. For example, what types of nursing expertise should be available at level 3 versus level 4 facilities? Is it important to have a wound care nurse available or nurses who are certified to provide specialized care for small infants or in a Neuro-NICU? How and who should make these determinations? Perhaps the discussion could begin by measuring the quality of high-functioning nursing teams, by further demonstrating that quality nursing care improves outcomes, by advocating for the importance of nursing expertise, and by continuing to involve nursing leaders in the process. The first step, though, is understanding why this all is so important to mothers and infants. Then, as the true experts in nursing care, nurses must begin to articulate the expertise, education, and other parameters that are required for risk-appropriate, quality care required to support ideal outcomes and move these crucial conversations forward, as well as to guide the future of neonatal nursing.",

Thus, information about related clinical care experience is scarce. Clinical Findings: This case report includes 26 infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of Tongji Hospital in Wuhan City who were born to mothers with suspected/confirmed COVID-19. The nursing and medical staff implemented care of these infants in strict accordance with infection control measures. Intervention: Emergency measures for the prevention and control of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the NICU were developed, and neonatal isolation, observation, and treatment were performed. Outcomes: Vital signs of the 26 infants remained stable during isolation and treatment, and no complications occurred. During the study period, neither the infants nor the nursing and medical staff were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Practice Recommendations: Based on our strict practices, infants born to mothers with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 should receive care in a single-patient room to support infection control and provide enhanced observation. During initial contact and nursing care, increased attention should be given to the protection of infants born to mothers with suspected/confirmed COVID-19.",

Nurses liked using dual temperature display with the abdominal-foot temperature difference. Surveys indicated preferences for larger displays and alarms for abnormal values. Thermal instability, stimulation, and thermistor detachment were associated with abnormal thermal gradients. Two exemplar cases are presented. Implications for Practice: Monitoring dual temperatures adds information to the clinical assessment. Implications for Research: Studies are needed to examine relationships between abnormal thermal gradients and infections, infant stability, and nursing care along with the underlying physiologic mechanisms. Studies are needed for wireless dual temperature monitoring.",

A clear and updated description of these applications for the neonatal population is needed to guide current nursing practice.To provide scientific evidence and guidance on the current genetic and genomic applications pertinent to neonatal care.A search of CINAHL and PubMed was conducted using the search terms \"newborn/neonatal\" and \"genetics,\" \"genomics,\" \"newborn screening,\" \"pharmacogenomics,\" \"ethical,\" and \"legal.\" Google searches were also conducted to synthesize professional guidelines, position statements, and current genetic practices.Components of the newborn genetic assessment, including details on the newborn physical examination, family history, and laboratory tests pertinent to the newborn, are reported. The history and process of newborn screening are described, in addition to the impact of advancements, such as whole exome and genome sequencing, on newborn screening. Pharmacogenomics, a genomic application that is currently utilized primarily in the research context for neonates, is described and future implications stated. Finally, the specific ethical and legal implications for these genetic and genomic applications are detailed, along with genetic/genomic resources for nurses.Providing nurses with the most up-to-date evidence on genetic and genomic applications ensures their involvement and contributions to quality neonatal care.Ongoing genetic/genomic research is needed to understand the implications of genetic/genomic applications on the neonatal population and how these new applications will change neonatal care.",

    "abstract": "Failure of the car seat tolerance screen (CSTS) during hospitalization often leads to a recommendation for automobile travel within a car bed at discharge.To describe the parental experience utilizing a car bed for infant automobile transportation.A descriptive, qualitative study design was undertaken with a purposive sample of parents recruited for a single interview in the pulmonary clinic at the time of the follow-up CSTS, approximately 1 month after hospital discharge. Interviews, guided by a semistructured interview tool, provided a holistic understanding of the parental experience utilizing car bed travel.Data from 15 parental interviews revealed an overarching emotional journey consisting of 5 themes: (1) an adjustment period; (2) decision-making related to the car bed purchase; (3) encounters with varied provider education and knowledge; (4) safety and security of the car bed during transit; and (5) space and mobility restrictions imposed by the car bed.While recommendations exist for infant travel in a car seat, supportive recommendations for parents with an infant who needs to travel in a car bed do not exist. Based on study findings, providing parents supportive guidelines, education, and recommendations for their infant requiring travel in a car bed may be a strategy to ease the stress experienced in this situation.Findings indicated a need to develop policies and standards, as well as comprehensive education, for providers and parents related to car bed travel. Further research is needed to identify strategies to best support parents and infants.",

    "abstract": "Background: Changes in the pediatrician's practice model have created demand for other medical care providers for hospitalized well newborns. Well newborn care may be the responsibility of those who work in any level I-IV neonatal intensive care units, whether in a primary or secondary role. No recent publications exist about how to approach the organization of tasks. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to present a structure and resources to guide the organization of tasks in the care of hospitalized well newborns for learners or occasional care providers. Methods: The methods used in this project included literature review to develop evidence-based practice resources. The literature was reviewed regarding the relevant history and resources to support task organization of well newborn care provided by skilled providers in the hospital. The goal is to establish a reference to support education about these approaches, which appear to be rooted in tradition. Findings: Evidence-based resources include an overview of provider tasks and responsibilities for well newborn care for each hospital day and per shift. Implication for Research: Future studies can measure mentor or learner perceptions of the value of these resources, critical thinking improvement, safety, and clinical outcomes. Implication for Practice: These resources may provide structure for learners or occasional providers who have studied the physiology, pathophysiology, and problem management concepts but need to learn how to execute their responsibilities in these busy environments.",

    "abstract": "The NANN Research Summit has been providing a platform for neonatal scholarship and clinical inquiry for 15 years. As the discipline of nursing and nursing research continue to evolve, it is important to gain perspective on current trends and needs for areas of strength and growth.To evaluate participant outcomes of the NANN Research Summit and determine opportunities for improvement.A 9-question survey was sent to 90 past participants for the Research Summit years 2015-2019.Thirty-seven (41%) participants from 2015 to 2019 responded. Of those responding, 75% continued to pursue their presentation topic; 95% felt empowered to continue their research based on their Summit experience; 84% felt more comfortable presenting their research findings after attending; 84% felt confident in publishing research after attending the Summit, with 43% reporting publications. These accomplished results would not have been possible without Mead Johnson's support. In addition, 57% did not publish the work presented and 65% lacked continued mentorship.A redesigned Summit is presented to address the priorities for growth and alignment with continued emphasis on collegiality among neonatal nurse scholars. The redesigned Summit will promote continued clinical inquiry as a result of intentional focus on mentorship and development of scholarship.The data collected from this initial survey will continue to serve as the basis for future data collection. Continued evaluation of strengths and areas for growth including the number of publications and mentorship experience can lead to expansion of research for the Summit facilitators and participants.",

    "abstract": "Effective bubble nasal continuous positive airway pressure (bnCPAP) implementation is a means to maintain functional residual capacity (FRC) and avoid pulmonary morbidities in neonates.A quality improvement project was introduced to establish a standardized bnCPAP care bundle.A bnCPAP care bundle focusing on shoulder roll use, bnCPAP positioning, assessment for suctioning need, and nasopharynx suctioning was created. The outcome measures collected were percentage of time the infant's pulse saturation was less than 86%, corrected gestational age (CGA) when off bnCPAP, length of time a neonate is on bnCPAP, Downes' score, and compliance to bnCPAP care bundle.An independent-samples t test found a statistically significant higher mean prior to the initiative in the percentage of time the oxygen saturation was less than 86%, Downes' score, length of time, and CGA to wean off bnCPAP ( M = 11.7% ± 10.1%, M = 1.6 ± 1.1, M = 27.7 days ± 29.0 days, and M = 35.0 weeks ± 3.38 weeks, respectively) than after the initiative ( M = 4.0% ± 4.8%, M = 1.1 ± 0.8, M = 11.2 days ± 10.2 days, and M = 32.8 weeks ± 1.00 weeks, respectively).Implementing a standardized bnCPAP care bundle showed improvement in oxygen saturation and increased success of weaning off bnCPAP. Future studies to increase the collected data are needed to compare the outcomes on infants born at each gestational age.",
