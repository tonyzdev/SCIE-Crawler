    "abstract": "The pathophysiology of acute spinal cord injury (SCI) involves primary and secondary mechanisms of injury. Though both mechanisms are involved in the neurological dysfunction in SCI most research however has focused on understanding the pathophysiology of the secondary damage and reducing the amount of delayed cell loss following SCI. Research has revealed extensive therapeutic windows in secondary injury mechanisms that could be manipulated by appropriate exogenous interventions. In contrast, primary injury to the cord happens unexpectedly, and it is associated with inevitable delays; ranging from several hours to days before care intervention is administered. Therefore, apart from achieving patient’s stabilization, the therapeutic window in the primary phase of injury is essentially obliterated, and consequently inaccessible for specialized. Coupled to this, the exacerbating effect of secondary injury mechanisms has generally commenced before the specialist intervention. Hence, knowledge of secondary injury mechanisms and their intricacies are invaluable requisite for any tailored therapeutic strategy in the persistent search for a cure of SCI. There are about 25 well-established secondary injury mechanisms in SCI, and are found in bits or clusters in literature. A vast number of these articles are not open access. Besides, articles with a comprehensive catalog of these mechanisms are not readily available. This article has cataloged over twenty five identified secondary mechanisms of injury in the spinal cord in an open access portal, and is particularly versatile for starters in spinal cord injury research.",

    "abstract": "The concept that neural information is encoded in the firing rate of neurons has been the dominant paradigm in neurobiology for many years. This paradigm has also been adopted by the theory of artificial neural networks. Recent physiological experiments demonstrate, however, that in many parts of the nervous system, neural code is founded on the timing of individual action potentials. This finding has given rise to the emergence of a new class of neural models, called spiking neural networks. In this paper we summarize basic properties of spiking neurons and spiking networks. Our focus is, specifically, on models of spike-based information coding, synaptic plasticity and learning. We also survey real-life applications of spiking models. The paper is meant to be an introduction to spiking neural networks for scientists from various disciplines interested in spike-based neural processing.",

    "abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is an active interface between the circulation and the central nervous system (CNS) with a dual function: the barrier function restricts the transport from the blood to the brain of potentially toxic or harmful substances; the carrier function is responsible for the transport of nutrients to the brain and removal of metabolites. The BBB plays a crucial role in the clinical practice as well. On the one side there is a large number of neurological disorders including cerebral ischemia, brain trauma and tumors, neurodegenerative disorders, in which the permeability of the BBB is increased. On the other hand due to the relative impermeability of the barrier many drugs are unable to reach the CNS in therapeutically relevant concentration, making the BBB one of the major impediments in the treatment of CNS disorders. The significant scientific and industrial interest in the physiology and pathology of the BBB led to the development of several in vitro models of the BBB. These models are mainly based on the culture of cerebral endothelial cells. The best in vitro models which mimic the best way the in vivo anatomical conditions are the co-culture models in which brain endothelial cells are co-cultured with astrocytes and/or pericytes. Our in vitro BBB model is characterized by high transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER regularily above 200 Ohm times square cm), low permeability and expression of several transporters. Our experiments have proven that the model is suitable for basic research and for testing the interaction between the BBB and potential drug candidates (toxicity, permeability, interaction with efflux transporters) as well.",

Many studies over the last four decades have recognized altered immune responses among individuals diagnosed with ASD. The purpose of this critical and comprehensive review is to examine the hypothesis that immune dysfunction is present more frequently, and it is related to ASD in humans. It was found that that often individuals diagnosed with ASD have alterations in immune cells such as T cells, B cells, monocytes, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells. Also, many individuals diagnosed with ASD have alterations in immunoglobulins and increased autoantibodies. Finally, an important portion of individuals diagnosed with ASD has elevated peripheral cytokines and chemokines and associated neuroinflammation. In conclusion, immune dysregulation and inflammation are important components of ASD diagnosis and are key components of the diagnosis and treatment of ASD.",

    "abstract": "The alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (15-25 Hz) and gamma (30-60 Hz) bands of the EEG have been long studied clinically because of their putative functional importance. Old experimental results indicate that repetitive stimulation of the visual pathway evokes synchronous responses at the cortical level with a gain that depends on frequency; oscillations within relevant bands are less damped at subsequent processing levels than others. Our current results show in the cat that cortico-geniculate feedback has a build-in potentiation mechanism that operates at around the beta frequency and activates thalamic cells thus lowering the threshold for visual information transmission. We have also shown that enhanced beta activity is propagated along this feedback pathway solely during attentive visual behavior. This activity consists of 300-1000 ms bursts that correlate in time with gamma oscillatory events. Beta-bursting activity spreads to all investigated visual centers, including the lateral posterior and pulvinar complex and higher cortical areas. Other supporting data are discussed that are concerned with the enhanced beta activity during attentive-like behavior of various species, including humans. Finally, we put forward a general hypothesis which attributes the appearance of oscillations within the alpha, beta and gamma bands to different activation states of the visual system. According to this hypothesis, alpha activity characterizes idle arousal of the system, while beta bursts shift the system to an attention state that consequently allows for gamma synchronization and perception.",

DA has been shown to be involved in the control of movements, the signaling of error in prediction of reward, motivation, and cognition. Cerebral DA depletion is the hallmark of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Other pathological states have also been associated with DA dysfunction, such as schizophrenia, autism, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, as well as drug abuse. DA is closely associated with reward-seeking behaviors, such as approach, consumption, and addiction. Recent researches suggest that the firing of DA neurons is a motivational substance as a consequence of reward-anticipation. This hypothesis is based on the evidence that, when a reward is greater than expected, the firing of certain DA neurons increases, which consequently increases desire or motivation towards the reward.",

    "abstract": "Most theorists propose that when a person is aware that a duration judgment must be made (prospective paradigm), experienced duration depends on attention to temporal information, which competes with attention to nontemporal information. When a person is not aware that a duration judgment must be made until later (retrospective paradigm), remembered duration depends on incidental memory for temporal information. In the present article we describe two experiments in which durations involved with high-level, executive-control functions were judged either prospectively or retrospectively. In one experiment, the executive function involved resolving syntactic ambiguity in reading. In another experiment, it involved controlling the switching between tasks. In both experiments, there was a unique cost to the operation of control high-level, executive functions which was manifested by prospective reproductions shortening a finding that supports an attentional model of prospective timing. In addition, activation of executive functions produced contextual changes that were encoded in memory and resulted in longer retrospective reproductions, a finding that supports a contextual-change model of retrospective timing. Thus, different cognitive processes underlie prospective and retrospective timing. Recent findings obtained by some brain researchers also support these conclusions.",

Several studies have suggested a disturbance in the copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) metabolism in ASDs. Zinc deficiency, excess Cu levels, and low Zn/Cu ratio are common in children diagnosed with an ASD. The literature also suggests that mercury accumulation may occur as a cause or consequence of metallothionein (MT) dysfunction in children diagnosed with an ASD, which may be one of the causes of Zn deficiency. MTs are proteins with important functions in metal metabolism and protection. Zinc and Cu bind to and participate in the control of the synthesis of MT proteins.

Out of 642 children screened for reading ability 49 dyslexics and 48 controls were tested for phonological awareness, auditory discrimination, motion detection, visual attention, and rhythm imitation. A combined cluster and discriminant analysis approach revealed three clusters of dyslexics with different cognitive deficits. Compared to reading-unimpaired children cluster no. 1 had worse phonological awareness; cluster no. 2 had higher attentional costs; cluster no. 3 performed worse in the phonological, auditory, and magnocellular tasks. These results indicate that dyslexia may result from distinct cognitive impairments.

    "abstract": "Obesity is associated with consumption of energy-dense diets and development of systemic inflammation. Gut microbiota play a role in energy harvest and inflammation and can influence the change from lean to obese phenotypes. The nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) is a brain target for gastrointestinal signals modulating satiety and alterations in gut-brain vagal pathway may promote overeating and obesity. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that high-fat diet‑induced changes in gut microbiota alter vagal gut-brain communication associated with increased body fat accumulation. Sprague-Dawley rats consumed a low energy‑dense rodent diet (LFD; 3.1 kcal/g) or high energy‑dense diet (HFD, 5.24 kcal/g). Minocycline was used to manipulate gut microbiota composition. 16S Sequencing was used to determine microbiota composition. Immunofluorescence against IB4 and Iba1 was used to determine NTS reorganization and microglia activation. Nodose ganglia from LFD rats were isolated and co-cultured with different bacteria strains to determine neurotoxicity. HFD altered gut microbiota with increases in Firmicutes/Bacteriodetes ratio and in pro-inflammatory Proteobacteria proliferation. HFD triggered reorganization of vagal afferents and microglia activation in the NTS, associated with weight gain. Minocycline-treated HFD rats exhibited microbiota profile comparable to LFD animals. Minocycline suppressed HFD‑induced reorganization of vagal afferents and microglia activation in the NTS, and reduced body fat accumulation. Proteobacteria isolated from cecum of HFD rats were toxic to vagal afferent neurons in culture. Our findings show that diet‑induced shift in gut microbiome may disrupt vagal gut‑brain communication resulting in microglia activation and increased body fat accumulation.",

Subjects were presented with a random sequence of auditory stimuli and instructed to respond to an infrequently occurring target stimulus inserted into a sequence of frequent standard and rare non-target stimuli. Results show that the magnitude of the frontal P3a is determined by the relative physical difference among stimuli, as it was larger for the stimulus more deviant from the standard. Major neural generators of the P3a were localized within frontal cortex and anterior cingulate gyrus. In contrast to this, the P3b, showing maximal amplitude at parietal locations, was larger for stimuli demanding a response than for the rare non-target. Major sources of the P3b included the superior parietal lobule and the posterior part of the cingulate gyrus. Our findings are in line with the hypothesis that P3a is related to alerting activity during the initial allocation of attention, while P3b is related to activation of a posterior network when the neuronal model of perceived stimulation is compared with the attentional trace.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDs), including autism spectrum disorder, attention‑deficit/hyperactivity disorder, tic disorder, obsessive‑compulsive disorder, and emotional disturbances, has increased notably in the past few decades. To date, debate continues as to the origins of NDs. Increases in widespread exposure to and bioaccumulation of chemical neurotoxicants have paralleled the upsurge in NDs, and are suggested to be causal agents for NDs. One consistent aspect of NDs is the male preponderance. This review considers the issue of male preponderance by reviewing the gender‑specific neurotoxic effects of recognized neurotoxicant chemicals to assess their possible etiology in NDs. This investigation consisted of a systematic literature review of original studies published from 1970-2016 on suspected neurotoxicants, to examine whether they have a disproportionate adverse effect based on gender. Based on that review, the neurotoxicants exhibiting consistent gender‑specific effects, with exposed males being more affected (than similarly exposed females), were: lead, Thimerosal/ethylmercury, some organochlorine pesticides (e.g., dieldrin, endosulfan, and heptachlor), and air pollution. The next group identified were neurotoxicants exhibiting gender‑specific neurotoxic effects, with males being somewhat (but not consistently) more affected than females: mercury vapor, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and organophosphate pesticides. Finally, there was a group of studies in which the neurotoxicants exhibited apparent gender‑related neurotoxic effects but failed to show whether exposed males were consistently more affected than females: inorganic mercury salts, methylmercury species, and certain endocrine disruptors (e.g., phthalates and BPA). The overall conclusion from the studies reviewed was that the brain in males is more vulnerable to many toxic exposures than it is in females. Evidence suggests that the reasons for the male brain being more vulnerable include: (1) greater glutathione availability in females; (2) greater sulfate‑based detoxification capacity in females; (3) potentiating effects of co‑exposure to neurotoxicants and testosterone; (4) greater neuroinflammatory response in males; (5) reduced vulnerability to oxidative stress in females; and (6) neuroprotective effects of female hormones (estrogen and progesterone), especially in the reduction of inflammation and oxidative stress.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive time management is an important aspect of human behaviour and cognition that has so far been understudied. Functional imaging studies in recent years have tried to identify the neural correlates of several timing functions, ranging from simple motor tapping to higher cognitive time estimation functions. Several regions of the frontal lobes, in particular dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), inferior prefrontal cortex (IFC), anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG) and the supplementary motor area (SMA), alongside non-frontal brain regions such as the inferior parietal lobes, the cerebellum and the basal ganglia have been found to be involved in tasks of motor timing and time estimation. In this paper we review and discuss the involvement of these brain regions in different tasks of cognitive time management, illustrating it with own findings on motor timing and time perception tasks using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The review shows that the same brain regions are involved in both motor timing and time estimation, suggesting that both functions are probably inseparable and mediated by common neural networks.",

Anti-cholinergic drugs induce amnesia, which can be reversed by withdrawal of the medication. Inhibition of the down-regulation of acetylcholine is, therefore, a strategy for the treatment of AD because it could augment acetylcholine levels within synaptic clefts. In this context, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, which improve cognitive functions, are currently approved for the treatment of AD. Stimulation of acetylcholine receptors, nicotinic or muscarinic, is another strategy; some drugs are currently under investigation, and reported to be effective. In addition, nicotinic stimulation exerts a neuroprotective effect, and reduces the amyloid burden. Cholinergic therapy may counter the symptoms and progress of AD.",

This response is not uniform but depends on the stress stimulus involved and on many other factors including the gender of the individual. In rats, corticosterone and ACTH levels as well as functional activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis are higher in females compared to males under both basal and stress conditions. Marked sex differences were observed in stress-induced changes posterior pituitary hormone release. In male rats, release of vasopressin is not stimulated during stress conditions without an osmotic component while in female rats a rise in plasma vasopressin levels was observed even after short immobilization. Oxytocin release is enhanced in response to the majority of stress stimuli and it was found to be greater in females than in males. Mentioned gender differences are attributed to the effect of sex steroids, particularly those of estrogens. Not enough information is available on gender differences in the neuroendocrine response during stress in humans. We observed a greater neuroendocrine activation in women than in men in response to heat exposure in sauna with pronounced differences in ACTH and prolactin release and partly also after a cold-pressor test. Understanding of gender differences in neuroendocrine response during stress might contribute to the explanation of the development of some emotional and other disorders with higher incidence in women.",

They interact with neurons, providing structural, metabolic and trophic support for them. In pathological circumstances, astrocytes have the potential to induce neuronal dysfunction, but they can also play a neuroprotective role, releasing neuronal growth factors. Here we review recent findings regarding the role of astrocytes in the biology of the brain in physiological conditions, as well as their reaction following the onset of neurodegenerative disorders.

    "abstract": "This paper first reviews some of the observations made on the locomotor capabilities of several animal species with a special emphasis on cats and including primates and man after complete spinal lesions. We show that animals can perform well-coordinated walking movements of the hindlimbs when they are placed on a treadmill belt and this locomotion is also adaptable to speed and perturbations. Cats with partial spinal lesions of the ventral and ventrolateral parts of the cord can perform voluntary quadrupedal locomotion overground or on the treadmill albeit with deficits in weight support and interlimb coordination. We also show that some drugs such as clonidine (an alpha-2 noradrenergic agonist) can be used to trigger locomotion in early-spinal cats and discuss the effects of various neurotransmitter systems on the expression of the locomotor pattern in both complete and partial spinal cats. It is concluded that a pharmacological approach could be used, in combination with other approaches, such as locomotor training and functional electrical stimulation, to improve locomotor functions after spinal cord injuries in humans.",

An especially negative asynchrony phenomenon in which the tap onset precedes the stimulus onset was used as an anticipatory response. In this experiment, to clarify the effects of higher brain functions, such as attention, a dual-task method was applied and a word memory task was used as a secondary task. The results revealed two types of anticipatory mechanisms from the standpoint of attentional resources involved in time perception. One is the anticipatory tapping that is influenced by attention and seen in the interstimulus-onset interval (ISI) range of 1 800 to 3 600 ms. In this region, the magnitude of synchronization error (SE) between tap onset and stimulus onset was scaled by the ISI. The other is the automatic anticipation that is not affected by attention and is seen in the 450 to 1 500 ms range. SE in this region was constant and independent of the ISI. Accordingly, this anticipatory timing mechanism in synchronous tapping is thought to be a dual process including the attention processing of temporal information and the embodied automatic anticipation.",

Glutamate is stored in synaptic vesicles and released upon stimulation. The homeostasis of glutamatergic system is maintained by a set of transporters present in plasma membrane and in the membrane of synaptic vesicles. The family of vesicular glutamate transporters in mammals is comprised of three highly homologous proteins: VGLUT1-3. The expression of particular VGLUTs is largely complementary with limited overlap and so far they are most specific markers for neurons that use glutamate as neurotransmitter. VGLUTs are regulated developmentally and determine functionally distinct populations of glutamatergic neurons. Controlling the activity of these proteins could potentially modulate the efficiency of excitatory neurotransmission. This review summarizes the recent knowledge concerning molecular and functional characteristic of vesicular glutamate transporters, their development, contribution to synaptic plasticity and their involvement in pathology of the nervous system.

    "abstract": "Neurotrophins belonging to the class of growth factors and including nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and neurotrophin-4/5 (NT-4/5) are widely recognized as essential factors in the developing central nervous system (CNS). Neurotrophins are synthesized as precursor forms (proneurotrophins). Mature forms of neurotrophins exert their effect by binding to specific tyrosine kinases receptors (TrkA, TrkB and TrkC) as well as via the p75 receptor, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily while proneurotrophins interact with the receptor p75 or co-receptor complex of p75 and sortilin, that is a Vps10p domain-containing transmembrane protein. Expression of neurotrophins corresponds with the onset of neurogenesis in developing mammalian species. BDNF is low in early embryonic stages of development, while NT-3 highly expresses in the developing CNS. Expression of neurotrophins receptors mainly overlaps at early development. Data concerning early distribution of neurotrophins and their receptors in the nervous system and results in mice with targeted disruptions of neurotrophin or receptor genes show that neurotrophins and their receptors play distinct roles in control and regulation of the most crucial developmental processes such as proliferation, migration, differentiation, survival, apoptosis and synaptic plasticity.",

    "abstract": "In order to understand the physiological role of the caudate nucleus, we combine here our laboratory data on cats with reports of patients with selective damage to this nucleus. Cats with bilateral removal of the caudate nuclei showed a stereotyped behavior consisting of persistently approaching and then following a person, another cat, or any object, and attempting to contact the target. Simultaneously, the animals exhibited a friendly disposition and persistent docility together with purring and forelimbs treading/kneading. The magnitude and duration of this behavior was proportional to the extent of the removal reaching a maximum after ablations of 65% or more of the caudate tissue. These cats were hyperactive but they had lost the feline elegance of movements. Additional features of acaudate cats were: (1) postural and accuracy deficits (plus perseveration) in paw usage tasks including bar pressing for food reward; (2) cognitive and perceptual impairments on a T-maze battery of tasks and on the bar pressing tasks; (3) blockage or blunting of the species-specific behavioral response to a single injection of morphine; Unilateral caudate nucleus removal did not produce global behavioral effects, but only deficit in the contralateral paw contact placing reaction and paw usage/bar pressing. Moreover and surprisingly, we found hypertrophy of the ipsilateral caudate nucleus following prenatal focal neocortical removal. The findings in human were also behavioral (not neurological) and also occurred with unilateral caudate damage. The main manifestations consisted of loss of drive (apathy), obsessive-compulsive behavior, cognitive deficits, stimulus-bound perseverative behavior, and hyperactivity. Based on all of the above data we propose that the specific function of the caudate nucleus is to control approach-attachment behavior, ranging from plain approach to a target, to romantic love. This putative function would account well for the caudate involvement in the pathophysiology of a number of clinical syndromes that we mention, all of which compromise approach-attachment- affect behaviors. In addition we conclude that the caudate nucleus contributes importantly to body and limbs posture as well as to the accuracy and speed of directed movements.",

Echo-planar MR imaging was performed in 52 subjects: consistent right-handers (RH), consistent left-handers (LH), and subjects who had been forced at an early age to switch their left-hand preferences toward the right side. The scanning was performed during simple (flexion/extension of the index finger) and complex (successive finger-thumb opposition) tasks. Subjects performed the tasks using both the preferred and non-preferred hand. In right-handers, there was a general predominance of left-hemisphere activation relative to right hemisphere activation. In lefthanders this pattern was reversed. The switched subjects showed no such volumetric asymmetry. Increasing levels of complexity of motor activity resulted in an increase in the volume of consistently activated areas and the involvement of the ipsilateral in addition to contralateral activations. In both right- and left-handers, movements of the preferred hand activated mainly the contralateral hemisphere, whereas movements of the non-preferred hand resulted in a more balanced pattern of activation in the two hemispheres, indicating greater involvement of the ipsilateral activations. Overall, this study shows that in both left- and right-handed subjects, the preferred hand is controlled mainly by the hemisphere contralateral to that hand, whereas the non-preferred hand is controlled by both hemispheres. The switched individuals share features of both lefthanders and right-handers regarding their motor control architectures.",

In this paper we present a modified weight drop model used to deliver a closed head minimal traumatic brain injury to mice, which closely mimics real-life injuries and the symptoms observed in mTBI patients. Our choice of impact force does not produce structural damage to the brain and its surrounding tissue (as examined by MRI), any skull fracture, no edema and no evident damage to the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Moreover, our mTBI mice show no abnormal behavior on recovering from the weight drop, or any change in other brain functions such as reflexes, balance, exploration, strength, locomotor activity and swim speed. Since our mTBI model does not produce neurological, motor or sensory damage to the mice, it allows the direct evaluation of mTBI sequelae on the mice behavior and cognitive abilities. Using a variety of cognitive and behavioral tests (Morris water maze, staircase test, passive avoidance test, water T-maze, hot palate, elevated plus maze and forced swimming test) we assessed the short- and long-term sequelae induced by our model. Our results indicate that our closed head mTBI cause profound and long-lasting, irreversible learning and memory impairments, accompanied by a depressive-like behavior in mice that are evident even 90 days post injury.

This study investigated the toxic effects of oral administration of 3 mg/kg/day acrolein on the rat cerebral cortex. Moreover, the neuroprotective effects of crocin, the main constituent of saffron, against acrolein toxicity were evaluated. We showed that acrolein decreased concentration of glutathione (GSH) and increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), Amyloid-beta (Abeta) and phospho-tau in the brain. Simultaneously, acrolein activated Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs) signalling pathways. Co-administration of crocin significantly attenuated MDA, Abeta and p-tau levels by modulating MAPKs signalling pathways.

    "abstract": "For centuries, inflammatory/foreign body reactions have plagued the attempts of clinicians to use metals for tissue and bone reconstructions. Since corrosion contributes to the rejection of metal by the body, an extremely bioinert metal – tantalum – has been successfully used in medicine. The outstanding biocompatibility and flexibility of tantalum established the basis for a growing cadre of clinical applications. One important application which benefited from the introduction of powder (particle) metallurgy is use of tantalum as bone implants. Porous materials have re-shaped the landscape of bone implants, as they allow for bone ingrowth and biological fixation, and eliminate implant loosening and related treatment failures. The unique bone-mimicking properties of porous tantalum enabled the use of tantalum as a material for bulk implants, and not only for coatings, as is the case with other porous metals. Moreover, porous tantalum also facilitates the ingrowth of soft tissue, including the formation of blood vessels that were found to assemble on the surface and within the structure of the porous tantalum. Also, since tantalum is strongly radiopaque due its high atomic number, this property is widely employed for marking in orthopedics and in endovascular medical devices. Another important development was the production of nanoparticles based on tantalum. These particles have been shown to be superior to iodinated contrast agents for blood pool imaging applications due to their longer circulation time. Their properties are similar to gold nanoparticles, but are far more cost-effective, and thus, well-positioned to replace gold in regenerative medicine for labeling and tracking of cell grafts through x-ray-based imaging. However, the amount of tantalum nanoparticles that can be taken up by stem cells is not enough to make individual cells visible in x-ray images. Thus, alternative strategies are needed, such as hydrogel or nanofiber scaffolds, which can be loaded with higher concentrations of nanoparticles, to increase the precision of cell deposition and allow tracking under x-ray guidance.",

    "abstract": "Marble burying is considered an, albeit controversial, animal model of the compulsive like behaviors of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Hallmark features of OCD patients are similarities and, more prominent, differences from anxiety disorders, e.g., the absence of sex differences and resistance to spontaneous remission. We report an experiment on marble burying by male and female C57/BL6/N mice. Animals were administered either the classic anxiolytic drug, diazepam, that targets the GABA receptor or a \"pure\" inhibitor of the serotonin transporter, escitalopram, that has been reported to be particularly effective in OCD. A burying paradigm that more precisely mimics the human condition was used, e.g., testing in the home environment, chronic drug exposure and acknowledging individual differences by pre-selecting for high marble burying. Results were that there were no sex differences in groups treated with drugs or in control mice. Both diazepam and escitalopram decreased numbers of marbles buried compared to vehicle-only controls in the absence of correlated changes in anxiety. Diazepam, however, was more effective than escitalopram in suppressing MB. The conclusion is that along with serotonin, GABA is involved in regulating compulsive behaviors. The marble burying paradigm may prove more useful for pharmacological drugs tests of impulsivity or attention deficit because of the involvement of serotonin and GABA in both disorders.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge about the gut microbiota in neuropsychiatric disorders. It is estimated that the human gut is colonized by up to 1018 microorganisms, mostly anaerobic bacteria. The gut microbiome is responsible for multiple functions, e.g. tightness of the intestine barrier, digestion and absorption. The correlation between gut dysbiosis and development of psychiatric, autoimmune and allergic diseases as well as bidirectional communication between brain and gut microflora have been shown. Recent findings suggest that specific bacteria can be involved in the development of clinical conditions, such as Autism Spectrum Disorders, depression and schizophrenia, and microbiota may be a target for therapeutic intervention providing novel treatment strategies.",

Changes in its latency, amplitude and topography are correlated with clinical findings in a wide range of different ailments.

Long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced by high frequency theta burst stimulation (TBS) when local synaptic inhibition was transiently suppressed by bicuculline methiodide application at the recording site immediately prior to TBS of the horizontal pathway. Without bicuculline, TBS failed to produce LTP. LTP could also be induced without Bic application by conjoint TBS of horizontal and vertical (ascending) inputs. By contrast, long-term depression (LTD) of horizontal transmission was induced by 10 min of 2 Hz stimulation. Depressed horizontal connections nevertheless retained the capability for synaptic strength increases. These studies indicate that synaptic modification across horizontally connected neurones is regulated both by the arrangement of their intrinsic circuits and by the availability of mechanisms for modification at individual synapses. Activity dependent forms of synaptic plasticity operating within horizontal connections may form a spatial substrate and mechanism for experience-dependent regulation of cortical representations.",

    "abstract": "This study is intended to clarify the functional role of different ERP components as indicators of the processing of emotions. The effect of emotional connotation of words on hemispheric lateralization is also explored. Visual ERPs were recorded to unilaterally presented positive, negative, and neutral words that should be categorized according to their emotional connotation. The P2 amplitude was larger to positive than to negative words whereas P3 amplitude was larger to positive words compared with neutral ones. The slow positive wave (SPW) was influenced by words emotionality at anterior and posterior sites differently. The amplitude of the N1 component was larger in the left hemisphere to contralaterally presented words. The P2 and P3 components were larger over the left hemisphere whereas the N3 and N4 components were larger over the right hemisphere to ipsilateral stimulation. The results support our hypotheses on the functional role of positive ERP components in the processing of an affective words connotation: the P2 wave reflects a general evaluation of emotional significance, the P3 a task-related decision, and the SPW an additional decision control in the context of the emotional experience of an individual. Neither the \"right hemisphere hypothesis\" nor \"valence hypothesis\" on lateralization of the processing of emotions were confirmed. Each hemisphere seems to exert its effect on emotion through specific hemispheric resources that are unequally allocated along the different stages of task processing and may cause alternation of hemispheric dominance.",

There are two major drawbacks of ITFs that limit their use in the CNS - cell-type expression specificity and stimulus-transcription coupling uncertainty. Recent technical advances in the field of molecular activity mapping now permit dual-labeling approaches that help resolve some of these ambiguities and identify neurons that are activated by different sensory stimuli. Furthermore, the recent identification of the robl/LC7-like gene, which shows immediate-early repression after stimulation, may have utility in functional mapping where it can be used to delineate quiescent neurons and serve as a complement to molecular activity markers.",

Decision mechanisms for different timing tasks often have a common form (thresholded normalized difference, TND), where differences between durations are \"normalized\" (i.e., divided) by another duration value, then compared with a threshold. The TND principle provides a rule for both similarity and identity judgements of duration. The role of threshold mechanisms in timing is discussed, and it is shown that some procedural manipulations appear to specifically alter threshold values. Finally, problems in modelling the decision processes involved in verbal estimation are discussed.",

Similarly, long-term memory exhibits a dependence on gene expression and altered protein synthesis. Recent evidence indicates that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade plays a role in both LTP and long-term memory. The MAPK cascade has heretofore largely been studied in the context of cell division and proliferation and as such, mechanisms for the regulation of gene expression by the MAPK cascade have received considerable attention. Given the possible role of altered gene expression in the late phase of L TP and in long -term memory, we evaluated the capacity of the MAPK ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) to regulate phosphorylation of the transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) in hippocampal area CA1. Our studies indicate a critical role for the MAPK cascade in the regulation of CREB phosphorylation in the hippocampus.",

They were asked to make judgements about the order of presented stimuli by pressing two response buttons in a certain order. The performance on auditory and visual tests was studied in relation to the Inter-Stimulus-Interval (ISI), which varied from 5 to 500 ms. In general, the level of performance was similar for the two modalities and the criterion of 75% of correct responses was reached at ISI longer than 40 ms, independently of the modality. These findings are consistent with previous research. However, at ISI of 5 ms, a significantly higher level of correctness was observed for the auditory than visual task. Such a tendency was also observed for ISIs of 10, 20 and 40 ms. Better processing in the auditory compared to the visual task at shorter ISIs may result from a different kind of transduction mechanism at the level of receptive cells in each modality. Alternatively, subjects may use two different kinds of response strategies in the auditory modality, only one being comparable to the response strategy in the visual modality.",

Accents in sentence-medial positions were characterized by a higher fundamental frequency (F0) and an increased duration. They elicited two different negative ERP components around 400 ms, depending on the predictability of the accent. When the accent was predictable, the negativity was fronto-laterally distributed and identified as the previously known Expectancy Negativity. Unpredictable accents elicited a more broadly distributed N400 with a central maximum, reflecting difficulties in semantic processing. For sentence-initial pitch accents, words had a higher F0 but of the same duration as sentence-initial words without pitch accents. These pitch accents elicited a P200 but no negativity in a 400 ms time window. The P200 was modulated by the onset latency of the F0 peak rather than its magnitude. We discuss the possibility of a delayed processing of sentence-initial accents when the actual occurrence of an F0 peak can be identified by comparing the F0 of the sentence-initial word to a reduced F0 of a word occurring later in the sentence.",

Current scientific studies demonstrate in vivo and in vitro its beneficial effects in a wide range of pathological conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, immune deficiency and hepatotoxicity. Ginsenosides or ginseng saponins as the active ingredients have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and immunostimulant properties, which raised speculations that these compounds could positively affect neurodegenerative disorders and delay neuronal aging. Conclusive clinical data in humans are still missing. However, results from animal studies and neuronal cell culture experiments indicate that ginsenosides can counteract and attenuate factors promoting neuronal death as environmental toxins, excitotoxic action of glutamate and rises in intracellular calcium, excessive release of free radicals and apoptotic events. Thus, neuroprotective actions of ginsenosides could come about as a valuable option to slow down neurodegenerative diseases. Correspondence should be addressed to W.D.

Specifically, no cueing effect (i.e., RTs difference between cued&amp;#150;uncued) was found in SRD children at 100 ms cue-target delay, while it was present at 250 ms cue-target delay. In contrast, in both CA and RL controls, a cueing effect was found at the shorter cue-target delay but it disappeared at the longer cue-target delay, as predicted by theories of automatic capture of attention. Our results suggest that FMA may be crucial for learning to read, and we propose a possible causal explanation of how a FMA deficit leads to specific reading disability, suggesting that sluggish FMA in dyslexic children could be caused by a specific parietal dysfunction.",

Further, the possible role of serotonin and the newly generated DG neurons in hippocampus-dependent memory is discussed.

This remote increase was detectable up to sixty days after the infarct. Transient GFAP elevation was also found in the hippocampus one day after photothrombosis, whereas it was more prolonged in amygdala, as demonstrated at four days after lesion. In contrast to a widespread astrocytic activation, the microglial response was shortlasting and local, confined to lesion and perilesional area.

The modification of stem cell properties may be necessary to fully exploit their potential. Genetic engineering, with an abundance of methodology to induce gene expression in a precise and well-controllable manner, is particularly attractive for this purpose. There are virus-based and non-viral methods of genetic manipulation. Genome-integrating viral vectors are usually characterized by highly efficient and long-term transgene expression, at a cost of safety. Non-integrating viruses are also highly efficient in transduction, and, while safer, offer only a limited duration of transgene expression. There is a great diversity of transfectable forms of nucleic acids; however, for efficient shuttling across cell membranes, additional manipulation is required. Both physical and chemical methods have been employed for this purpose. Stem cell engineering for clinical applications is still in its infancy and requires further research. There are two main strategies for inducing transgene expression in therapeutic cells: transient and permanent expression. In many cases, including stem cell trafficking and using cell therapy for the treatment of rapid-onset disease with a short healing process, transient transgene expression may be a sufficient and optimal approach. For that purpose, mRNA-based methods seem ideally suited, as they are characterized by a rapid, highly efficient transfection, with outstanding safety. Permanent transgene expression is primarily based on the application of viral vectors, and, due to safety concerns, these methods are more challenging. There is active, ongoing research toward the development of non-viral methods that would induce permanent expression, such as transposons and mammalian artificial chromosomes.",

Each of the COP measures showed the involvement of different neuromuscular and biomechanical mechanisms in the stabilization of standing posture. The DI documented a very stable proportion between frontal and saggital controls, with roughly 60 percent of the swaying movements being performed in the AP direction. The AP DI was significantly higher in comparison with the ML value (0.71+/-0.04 vs. 0.55+/-0.06). This proportion remained at the same level in both experimental groups and it was only slightly affected by the visual conditions. Analysis of the SR confirmed that to maintain stable stance the neuromuscular system must allocate 50 percent more effort to control AP stability. The results also documented gender-related differences in postural stability. Generally the female subjects appeared to have lower postural stability as evidenced by higher COM and COP velocities. Consequently the higher SR values observed in the female group indicate a need for higher neuromuscular efforts to maintain stable posture. The introduced here set of COP measures proved to be a valuable standard for static posturography, creating the opportunity for improved and reliable assessment of postural stability.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral hypoperfusion, or insufficient blood flow in the brain, occurs in many areas of the brain in patients diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Hypoperfusion was demonstrated in the brains of individuals with ASD when compared to normal healthy control brains either using positron emission tomography (PET) or single‑photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The affected areas include, but are not limited to the: prefrontal, frontal, temporal, occipital, and parietal cortices; thalami; basal ganglia; cingulate cortex; caudate nucleus; the limbic system including the hippocampal area; putamen; substantia nigra; cerebellum; and associative cortices. Moreover, correlations between symptom scores and hypoperfusion in the brains of individuals diagnosed with an ASD were found indicating that the greater the autism symptom pathology, the more significant the cerebral hypoperfusion or vascular pathology in the brain. Evidence suggests that brain inflammation and vascular inflammation may explain a part of the hypoperfusion. There is also evidence of a lack of normal compensatory increase in blood flow when the subjects are challenged with a task. Some studies propose treatments that can address the hypoperfusion found among individuals diagnosed with an ASD, bringing symptom relief to some extent. This review will explore the evidence that indicates cerebral hypoperfusion in ASD, as well as the possible etiological aspects, complications, and treatments.",

    "abstract": "In this review we will discuss different ways for re-establishing serotonergic activity that can enhance recovery of coordinated plantar stepping after spinal cord injury in adult rats. It is well known that serotoninergic neurons located in the medulla are able to initiate locomotor activity. This effect is exerted by actions on motoneurons and on neurons of the locomotor CPG (Central Pattern Generator). Motoneuron and interneuron excitability is increased, and putative CPG interneurons display oscillatory behaviour in response to serotonin receptor activation. The medullary serotonergic nuclei play multiple roles in the control of locomotion, and they terminate on specific target neurons with different types of serotonergic receptors in the spinal cord. Activation of these serotonergic receptors can restore locomotor movements after spinal cord injury. Specifically, using defined serotonergic agonists the 5-HT2 receptors can be stimulated to control CPG activation as well as motoneuron output, while 5-HT7 receptors to control activity of the locomotor CPG. These results are consistent with the roles for these receptors during locomotion in intact rodents and in rodent brainstem–spinal cord in vitro preparations. The other possibility to encourage the remaining spinal cord circuitry below the total transection to control recovery of plantar hindlimb stepping is restoration of serotonergic innervation by intraspinal grafting of embryonic 5-HT neurons. Our data show that grafting of different populations of 5-HT neurons dissected from embryonic brainstem provides differential control over multiple components of the spinal locomotor circuitry through specific serotonin receptors. Moreover, we demonstrated that the best effect of motor recovery is obtained after grafting of neurons destined to form the B1, B2 and B3 descending 5-HT systems. Using only one of the subpopulations for intraspinal grafting, for example, B3 or the lateral group of 5-HT neurons, induces only partial recovery of plantar stepping with a clear lack of proper interlimb coordination. This confirms the hypothesis that transplantation of 5-HT neurons from specific embryonic sources is necessary to obtain optimal recovery of locomotor hindlimb movement.",

Many of the same mechanisms that play a role in hemostasis and thrombosis facilitate platelets the participation in other physiological and pathological processes, particularly in the inflammation, the immune response and central nervous system disorders. Platelets are involved in pathophysiology of central nervous system diseases, especially in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, but their role appears to be neglected. Platelets contribute to the inflammation and cooperate with immune cells in inflammatory and immune responses. These blood cells were identified in inflamed spinal cord and in the brain in chronic active lesions of multiple sclerosis and in the related animal models referred as Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis. This review summarizes recent insights in the platelet activation accompanied by the exocytosis of bioactive compounds stored in granules, formation of platelet microparticles, expression of specific membrane receptors, synthesis of numerous biomediators, generation of free radicals, and introduces the mechanisms by which activated platelets may be involved in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis.

    "abstract": "In recent years, growing evidence suggests that lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial endotoxin found in the outer membrane of gram‑negative bacteria, can influence cognitive functions, particularly memory formation and retrieval. However, the underlying mechanisms through which LPS exerts its effects on memory remain incompletely understood. This review used various electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, to identify relevant studies published between 2000 and 2024. Articles were selected based on their focus on LPS‑induced memory impairments, including experimental models, molecular pathways, and neurochemical alterations. LPS administration has been consistently shown to disrupt memory processes in both animals and humans, although the magnitude and duration of memory impairments might vary depending on factors such as dose, timing, and context of LPS exposure. Several potential mechanisms have been proposed to explain LPS‑induced memory deficits, including neuroinflammation, alterations in synaptic plasticity, disruption of neurotransmitter systems, and dysfunction of the blood‑brain barrier. Moreover, LPS has been found to activate immune signaling pathways, such as toll‑like receptors, interleukins, and microglia, which can further contribute to cognitive impairments. Such insights may pave the way for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions aimed at ameliorating memory deficits associated with conditions involving LPS exposure, including bacterial infections, sepsis, and neuroinflammatory disorders.",

Recent data from our and other groups indicate that extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) 1may playa critical role in suppressing neuronal apoptosis triggered by cellular damage. Thus, it appears that either Erk1/2 or PI-3K, depending on the nature of the death-inducing stimulus, can mediate anti-apoptotic signaling of neurotrophins.

From a battery of commonly use sway measures, only the anteroposterior COM and the COP path lengths proved their high sensitivity and discriminative power to the imposed vision conditions. Based upon these indices, a new measure - sway ratio (SR) - was computed, as the COP-to-COM path length ratio. The measure can easily distinguish vision vs. no vision in the elderly. The SR can be successfully accessed base upon the COP signal only. In contrast to traditional sway indices, the SR as a relative measure is insensitive to the length of sampled record and to the signal sampling frequency. Its magnitude can be interpreted as an average amount of balance controlling motor activity that coincides with a unit COM displacement. The SR is recommended as a reliable measure that allows for assessment of postural stability.",

    "abstract": "Recent development of neuroimaging techniques has opened new possibilities for the study of the relation between handedness and the brain functional architecture. Here we report fMRI measurements of dominant and non-dominant hand movement representation in 12 right-handed subjects using block design. We measured possible asymmetry in the total volume of activated neural tissue in the two hemispheres during simple and complex finger movements performed either with the right hand or with the left hand. Simple movements consisted in contraction/extension of the index finger and complex movements in successive finger-thumb opposition from little finger to index finger. A general predominance of left-hemisphere activation relative to right hemisphere activation was found. Increasing the complexity of the motor activity resulted in an enlargement of the volume of consistently activated areas and greater involvement of ipsilateral areas, especially in the left hemisphere. Movements of the dominant hand elicited large contralateral activation (larger than movements of the non-dominant hand) and relatively smaller ipsilateral activation. Movements of the non-dominant hand resulted in a more balanced pattern of activation in the two hemispheres, due to relatively greater ipsilateral activation. This suggests that the dominant (right) hand is controlled mainly by the contralateral (left) hemisphere, whereas the nondominant hand is controlled by both left and right hemispheres. This effect is especially apparent during execution of complex movements. The expansion of brain areas involved in motor control in the hemisphere contralateral to the dominant hand may provide neural substrate for higher efficiency and a greater motor skill repertoire of the preferred hand.",

Among the putative mechanisms of homocysteineevoked neurotoxicity, disturbances in methylation processes and NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity have been suggested. Our previous studies demonstrated that group I metabotropic glutamate receptors along with NMDA receptors participate in acute homocysteine-induced neuronal damage. In this study, using propidium iodide staining, we tested whether the same mechanism may mediate chronic homocysteine neurotoxicity. Our results confirmed that the application of D,L-homocysteine in micromolar concentrations for 3 days induces neurodegeneration in primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons. Uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist MK801, and mGlu1 or mGlu5 receptor antagonists (LY367385 and MPEP, respectively), given alone provided very limited neuroprotection. However, simultaneous application of the NMDA receptor antagonists MK-801, memantine or amantadine and MPEP almost completely prevented chronic homocysteine neurotoxicity. These findings suggest a novel therapeutic strategy to combat neurodegeneration induced by hyperhomocysteinemia comprising a combination of antagonists of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors and NMDA receptors.

SSEP latencies in the transplanted group were significantly shorter than in the media-treated group. Pathologically, LacZ and hTau positive cells were located at the injury and adjacent sites. The data indicate improvement in functional outcome in animals treated with hMSC transplantation compared to media-treated animals.",

Although it is evident that this protein is enriched in the presynaptic terminals of neurons, localization in synaptic vesicles has not been conclusively determined. Here, we show that alpha-synuclein is present, but not enriched, in synaptic vesicles using highly purified synaptic vesicle preparations from rat brain homogenate. Immunoisolation of vesicles using antibodies against synaptophysin or synaptobrevin confirmed the presence of alpha-synuclein in synaptic vesicles. Additional separation of synaptic vesicles by sucrose velocity centrifugation showed that there are different subpopulations of synaptic vesicles and that alpha-synuclein is present only in a specific subpopulation, whereas synaptophysin and synaptobrevin were found in all the synaptic vesicles. Presence of alpha-synuclein only in a subset of synaptic vesicles suggests that this protein may have a specific function in synaptic vesicle cycling, hence in synaptic transmission.",

    "abstract": "The stem cells are characterized by self-renewal ability and potential to differentiate into other cell types of the body. They are residuing in defined microenvironments – “stem cell niches”. The embryonic stem cells (ESC) are derived from embryos which exist in 3-5 percent oxygen condition. This environment is physiologically normal not only for ES cells but also for many other types of stem cells including neural stem cells (NSC). These observations suggest that low oxygen condition plays a very important role in the maintenance of cell stemness. Pluripotency is regulated by the family of hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs), which are dependent on oxygen tensions. HIF-2-alpha is an upstream regulator of Oct4, which is one of the main transcription factors used to generate the first induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). It has been shown that knock-down of HIF-2-alpha but not HIF-1-alpha, leads to a decrease in the expression of Oct4, Nanog and Sox2, which are important stem cells markers. The structure of hypoxia inducible factors as well as their behavior in hypoxia and normoxia was described. Therefore optimization of oxygen concentration seems to be crucial from the stem cell transplantation as well as iPS transplantation standpoint. Although many experiments with cell culture under low oxygen condition were performed, there is still much that is unknown. This short review presents some aspects on important issue of hypoxia induced regulation of stemness.",

    "abstract": "Depression is a disorder characterized not only by persistent negative mood, lack of motivation and a „ruminative” style of thinking, but also by specific deficits in cognitive functioning. These deficits are especially pronounced when integration of information is required. Previous research on linear syllogisms points to a clear pattern of cognitive disturbances present in people suffering from depressive disorders, as well as in people with elevated negative mood. Such disturbances are characterized by deficits in the integration of piecemeal information into coherent mental representations. In this review, I present evidence which suggests that the dysfunction of specific brain areas plays a crucial role in creating reasoning and information integration problems among people with depression and with heightened negative mood. As the increasingly prevalent systems neuroscience approach is spreading into the study of mental disorders, it is important to understand how and which brain networks are involved in creating certain symptoms of depression. Two large brain networks are of particular interest when considering depression: the default mode network (DMN) and the fronto-parietal (executive) network (FNP). The DMN network shows abnormally high activity in the depressed population, whereas FNP circuit activity is diminished. Disturbances within the FNP network seem to be strongly associated with cognitive problems in depression, especially those concerning executive functions. The dysfunctions within the fronto-parietal network are most probably connected to ineffective transmission of information between prefrontal and parietal regions, and also to an imbalance between FNP and DMN circuits. Inefficiency of this crucial circuits functioning may be a more general mechanism leading to problems with flexible cognition and executive functions, and could be the cause of more typical symptoms of depression like persistent rumination.",

Many of these interactions involve transmembrane integrin receptors. Integrins cluster in specific cell-matrix adhesions to provide dynamic links between extracellular and intracellular environments by activation of numerous signal transduction pathways which may influence cell behaviour profoundly by influence on both gene expression and post-transcriptional signalling cascade.

Thirty six patients with DSM-IV primary insomnia diagnosis (mean age 36 years) and 29 controls, matched for age and education, participated in the study. Waking EEG from 21 scalp electrodes was subjected to spectral analyses using a fast Fourier transform algorithm. Significantly lower values of power in the theta range and higher values of beta power were found in insomniacs as compared to control subjects. This theta power decrease in patients suffering from insomnia was not uniform throughout the brain, but it was pronounced in prefrontal derivations. Lower values of theta power correlated negatively and higher values of beta power correlated postively with Hyperarousal Scale score. Results of the research presented here support the notion of twenty-four hour hyperarousal in primary insomnia. Attenuated theta and enhanced beta power can be electrophysiological correlates of dysfunctional arousal in insomnia. Less waking theta power in insomniacs suggests a decrease in homeostatic sleep propensity.",

Significant effects of biogenic amine administration were observed almost exclusively in the case of confrontations with allospecific opponents. Serotonin treatment exerted stimulatory effects on behavior patterns involving physical aggression (biting accompanied by gaster flexing, dragging and formic acid spraying), but these effects were relatively weak and/or documented by indirect evidence. Dopamine administration exerted a stimulatory effect on open-mandible threats directed by F. polyctena to F. fusca and to cricket nymphs, and on biting behavior directed to cricket nymphs. Surprisingly, octopamine treatment did not exert significant effects on aggressive behavior of the tested ants. Tyramine administration exerted a suppressing effect on threatening behavior directed to F. fusca, but led to shortening of the latencies to the first open-mandible threat during the tests with cricket nymphs. Biogenic amine administration also influenced non-aggressive behavior of the tested ants. Our findings confirmed the role of serotonin and dopamine in the mediation of ant aggressive behavior and documented for the first time significant effects of tyramine treatment on ant aggressive behavior. We also demonstrated that not only specific patterns of ant aggressive behavior, but also behavioral effects of biogenic amine treatments are as a rule strongly context-dependent.",

Various studies described both beneficial and detrimental aspects of activated astrocytes, suggesting the existence of different subtypes. We investigated this issue using a novel object-based approach to study characteristics of astrogliosis after stroke. Spontaneously hypertensive rats received permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion. After 96 h, brain specimens were removed, fixed and stained for GFAP, glutamine synthetase (GS), S100Beta and Musashi1 (Msh1). Three regions of interest were defined (contralateral hemisphere, ipsilateral remote zone and infarct border zone), and confocal stacks were acquired (n=5 biological with each n=4 technical replicates). The stacks were background-corrected and colocalization between the selected markers and GFAP was determined using an automated thresholding algorithm. The fluorescence and colocalization channels were then converted into 3D-objects using both intensity and volume as filters to ultimately determine the final volumes of marker expression and colocalization, as well as the morphological changes of astrocyte process arborisation. We found that both S100Beta and Msh1 determined the same GFAP-positive astroglial cell population albeit the cellular compartments differed. GFAP stained most of the astrocyte processes and is hence suitable for the analysis of qualitative characteristics of astrogliosis. Due to its peri-nuclear localization, Msh1 is appropriate to estimate the total number of astrocytes even in regions with severe reactive astrogliosis. GS expression in GFAP-positive astrocytes was high in the remote zone and low at the infarct border, indicating the existence of astrocyte subclasses.",

Analgesia produced by classical opioids is mediated extensively by binding to opioid receptors located in the brain or the spinal cord. Nevertheless, opioid receptors are also expressed outside the CNS in the periphery and may become valuable assets in eliciting analgesia devoid of shortcomings typical for the activation of their central counterparts. The discovery of endogenous opioid peptides that participate in the formation, transmission, modulation and perception of pain signals offers numerous opportunities for the development of new analgesics. Novel peptidic opioid receptor analogs, which show limited access through the blood brain barrier may support pain therapy requiring prolonged use of opioid drugs.",

Basic characteristic of these diseases is affective disorder shifting the mood of the patient to depression (together with anxiety or not) or towards to euphoria. Available drugs are usually divided into two groups - mood stabilizers, which are used primarily to treat bipolar disorder, and antidepressants for the treatment of unipolar depression. Lithium is still recommended as the first choice for dealing with bipolar disorder. Despite abundant clinical use of mood stabilizing drugs, important questions regarding their mechanism of action remain open. In this paper we present the brief review of rather diversified hypotheses and ideas about mechanisms of genesis of mood disorders and lithium interferences with these pathological states. New data derived from the high-resolution crystallographic studies of allosteric, Na+-binding sites present in G protein coupled receptors are given together with data indicating the similarity between lithium and magnesium cations. In this context, similarities and dissimilarities between the useful \"poison\" with narrow therapeutic window (Li+) and the bivalent cation acting like cofactor of more than 300 enzymatic reactions (Mg2+) are pointed out together with results indicating enhanced activity of trimeric G proteins in bipolar disorder.",

A number of recent studies are briefly outlined to provide examples demonstrating the use of a range of physiological measures (central and peripheral) in a variety of situations (from pistol range to the laboratory) with different subject groups (adults, children and psychiatric patients). Finally, the use of heart rate data in the investigation of task-relevant cognitive load is discussed as a relatively simple but sensitive index to explore drug and other effects in cognition.

Some authors reported a straight priming effect i.e., responses were faster when primes and targets called for the same response than when they called for different responses. Other authors found a reversed pattern of results. Our results suggest that the sign of the priming effect depends on mask structure. Inverse priming was obtained only for masks containing the searched-for feature even though informational content of the masks was neutral. With masks of irrelevant structure, straight priming effects were found. Thus, masks are not passive stimuli whose roles are limited to rendering the prime invisible. Processing of the mask may interact with prime and target processing. Implications of the results are discussed for two hypotheses trying to account for straight and inverse priming (the self-inhibition hypothesis and object-updating hypothesis).",

A prominent theory of aging claims that the anatomical and functional degeneration that organs undergo during aging is a consequence of accumulated free radical damage. This being so, melatonin may well play a significant role in aging processes. If the drop in melatonin which normally occurs as animals age could be prevented, perhaps the aging process would also be delayed. Also, supplemental administration of melatonin may be beneficial in delaying age-related degenerative conditions. Certainly, free radical damage has been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative disorders. Theoretically, melatonin administration may forestall these as well.",

Levels of alpha beta40 and alpha beta42 were measured in plasma from 54 patients with AD, 39 subjects with MCI and 35 controls using a commercially available ELISA. Mean plasma alpha beta42 levels were significantly higher in MCI as compared to both AD (P < 0.001) and control subjects (P < 0.001), while alpha beta40 did not differ between the groups. No correlations were observed between alpha beta levels and age, MMSE scores or gender. According to ROC curve analysis the maximum accuracy in discriminating MCI versus both controls and AD subjects has been achieved using a cut-off value of 3.8.",

A 3-stimulus oddball paradigm was employed in which subjects were presented with random sequence of tones while they performed a discrimination task in visual modality with no response to the tone (passive task) or responded to an infrequently occurring target stimulus inserted into sequence of frequent standard and rare non-target stimuli (active task). Results show that the magnitude of the frontal P3 response is determined by the relative perceptual distinctiveness among stimuli. The amplitude of frontal component is larger for the stimuli more deviated from the standard in both passive and active tasks. In all cases however, a maximum over central or fronto-central scalp regions was demonstrated. Moreover, amplitude of this component was influenced by the strength of attentional focus – a significantly larger response was obtained in the active session than in its passive counterpart. The apparent parietal P3 responses were obtained only in the active condition. The amplitude of this component is larger for the target than the non-target across all electrode sites, but both demonstrated a parietal maxima. This findings suggest that generation of early frontal P3 could be related to alerting activity of frontal cortex irrespective of stimulus context, while generation of later parietal P3 is related to temporo-parietal network activated when neuronal model of perceived stimulation and attentional trace are comparing.",

Both are reflected in electrodermal activity and measured by skin conductance level. Our previous studies in this area have indicated that physiological responses to stimuli in a task are dependent on the arousal level at the time of stimulus presentation, rather than the task-related activation. In contrast, performance on the task is dependent on the task-related activation, rather than the current arousal level. That is, different aspects of the individual's state determine physiological and behavioral responses. Those studies had examined between-subjects differences in arousal and activation. The present study investigated the relevance of this separation in an across-subjects examination of fluctuations in arousal and activation, and their effects on physiological and behavioral responses, during a continuous performance task. It was found that the magnitude of the phasic orienting reflex to the targets during the task was dependent mainly on arousal, rather than task-related relative activation. Reaction time improved with increasing relative activation, but not with arousal. These findings support our earlier conclusions relating to the usefulness of arousal and activation as distinguishable features of the energetics of physiological and behavioral functions.",

In demographic and perinatal measures there were no consistent differences between the autistic and control groups. Autistic children had a significantly greater prevalence of adverse reactions after vaccinations and abnormal development than controls. Between 45 and 80% of autistic children experienced developmental regress. Autistic children significantly differed from healthy peers in the concentrations of mercury in hair: younger autistics had lower levels, while older - higher levels than their respective controls.

Four levels of narrow-band blue light at the cornea were presented during nighttime sessions. The ratio of electroencephalographic alpha power density with eyes closed to eyes open (alpha attenuation coefficient, AAC) and the Norris mood scale were used. The AAC and ratings of alertness increased monotonically with irradiance and were highly correlated. Both measures of alertness were highly correlated with model predictions of nocturnal melatonin suppression for the same circadian light stimulus, consistent with the inference that the suprachiasmatic nuclei play an important role in nocturnal alertness as well as circadian regulation.

In spite of the extensive research in the field of stroke biology, there is little effective treatment for a completed disease onset. Numerous neuroprotective strategies have failed in clinical trials because of lack of efficacy or unacceptable side-effects. The challenge of clinical trial design is now to understand the process leading to ischemic brain injury and thus identify the targets for intervention in stroke. Therefore, uncovering cellular and molecular processes involved in ischemic brain injury is of critical importance. The review discusses the current understanding of these processes engaged in pathogenesis of stroke including excitotoxicity and inflammation. In addition recruitment of endogenous progenitors engaged in neurogenesis and vascular regeneration has been implicated. All of the aforementioned changes opted for therapeutic intervention to protect neurons in the region adjacent to the ischemic cerebral tissue and enhance cell recovery. Stem cell transplantation seems to offer a major promise of this therapy in stroke disorders.",

The objective of the present studies was to determine an impact of excess body weight on basic spatiotemporal gait measures and to test the hypothesis that leg swing phase may account for a load-related adaptation of the stride characteristics. To this end the basic spatial and temporal stride measures were assessed in 100 obese and 36 lean women (age range between 18 and 67 years) walking with their self-selected pace on a 10-meter long and 1 meter wide instrumented pathway. Among the subjects there were: 44 with class I obesity, 27 with class II obesity, and 29 with class III. Subjects' stance and swing times as well as the stride lengths were recorded by means of contact copper-film electrodes attached to a sole of subject' footwear. The acquired gait measures were used then to compute: a mean velocity of walking, double support times and a mean velocity of a foot during swing phase. Data analysis showed that subjects from every experimental groups walked with a very similar speed (1.08 +/- 0.2 m/s) and cadence (106 +/- 10 steps/min). Their stance time was not affected by body weight and it remained at the mean level of 746 +/- 90 ms for all groups. The temporal stride characteristics and the stance-to-swing ratio were, however, substantially modified in obese individuals due to attenuation of the swing time. As a consequence, the remaining normalized (i.e., expressed as percentage of gait cycle time) phases of stride: the stance and the double support were relatively longer. While the swing time negatively correlated with the body mass index (BMI), the normalized stance and the double support exhibited strong positive correlation (r=0.46) with the BMI. The increase of leg swing velocity seems the main and unique adaptation mechanism that is utilized in the preferred walking gait in obese women.",

Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion has been linked to neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its subsequent cognitive impairment in which oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are the principal culprits. Cerebrovascular hypoperfusion was experimentally achieved by bilateral common carotid arteries occlusion (2VO) in rats. Morris water maze (MWM) test was employed to assess the effects of NSO on spatial cognitive function before and after 2VO intervention. Rats were divided into long-term memory (LTM) and short-term memory (STM) groups, each was further subdivided into 3 subgroups: sham control, untreated 2VO and NSO treated 2VO group. All subgroups were tested with MWM at the tenth postoperative week. Working memory test results for both sham control and NSO treated groups showed significantly lower escape latency time and total distance travelled than untreated 2VO group. Similarly, LTM and STM MWM tests for sham control and NSO treated groups revealed significantly better maze test performance as compared to untreated 2VO group. Sham control and NSO treated 2VO groups demonstrated superior probe memory test performance as compared to untreated 2VO group. The fixed oil of Nigella sativa seeds has demonstrated noticeable spatial cognitive preservation in rats challenged with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion which indicates a promising prospective neuroprotective effect.",

    "abstract": "Neurological diseases are a heterogenous group of disorders that are related to alterations in nervous system function. The genetic background of neurological diseases is heterogenous and may include chromosomal aberrations, specific gene mutations and epigenetic defects. This review is aimed at presenting of selected diseases that are associated with different epigenetic alterations. The imprinting defects on chromosome 15 are the cause of Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes that both are characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delay and specific behavioral phenotype. Besides the imprinting defect, these diseases can also be caused by deletion of chromosome 15 or uniparental disomy. Aberrant epigenetic regulation is also specific for Fragile X syndrome that is caused by expansion of CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene that leads to global methylation of the promoter region and repression of FMR1 transcription. A number of neurological diseases, mainly associated with intellectual impairment, may be caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in epigenetic regulation. The number of such diseases is rapidly growing thanks to the implementation of genomic sequencing for the identification of their molecular causes. One of the best known diseases linked to defects in epigenetic modifiers is Rett syndrome caused by a mutation in the MECP2 gene or its variant – Rett-like syndrome caused by a mutation in CDKL5 or FOXG1 genes. As the epigenetic signature is potentially reversible, much attention is focused on possible therapies with drugs that influence DNA or histone modifications. This is especially important in the case of neurological disorders in which epigenetic changes are observed as the effect of the disease.",

Of the models referred to above, the group of developmental disorder models is particularly noteworthy, as they are primarily easy to use, and the methods are highly sensitive. High scientific value of these models is associated with the neurodevelopmental theory which stipulates that at an early stage of body development, a number of interactions between genetic and environmental factors may affect the development of neurons which may cause disorders of brain cytoarchitecture development.

A delay-discounting task was administered to participants with adult ADHD and a comparison group in conjunction with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants responded to a series of questions that required judgments between small sums of money available immediately and larger sums obtained after a temporal delay. Question parameters were adjusted by an adaptive algorithm designed to converge on each participant’s discounting indifference point, an individual set point at which there is equal valuation of both choices. In all participants, robust task activation was observed in regions previously identified in functional imaging studies of delay discounting. However, adults with ADHD showed less task activation in a number of regions including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, superior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate, caudate nucleus and declive of the cerebellum. Additionally, the degree to which a participant discounted delayed rewards was inversely related to task activation in the cerebellum. The results suggest that the bias towards immediate rewards in childhood ADHD may not persist behaviorally, but instead present in adulthood as alterations in frontostriatal and frontocerebellar networks.",

Studies on the mechanisms of depression require both appropriate experimental models (most of them based on the exposure of animals to chronic stressors), and appropriate tests for assessment of depressive states. In this study male Wistar rats were exposed to two different chronic stress paradigms: an eight-week chronic unpredictable mild stress or a two-week combined chronic stress. The behavioral effects of stress were evaluated using sucrose preference, forced swim and open field tests. After the exposure to chronic unpredictable mild stress, anhedonia was developed, activity in the open field increased, while no changes in the duration of passive floating could be detected. After chronic combined stress, anhedonia was also evident, whereas behavior in the open field and forced swim test did not change. The levels of corticosterone in the blood and brain structures involved in stress-response did not differ from control in both experiments. The absence of significant changes in corticosterone levels and passive floating may be indicative of the adaptation of animals to chronic stress. Anhedonia appears to be a more sensitive indicator of depressive-like behavioral effects of chronic stress as compared to behavior in the forced swim or open field tests.",

    "abstract": "In 2002 a series of mutations in the GDAP1 gene were reported in patients suffering from Charcot‑Marie‑Tooth disease manifesting as early-onset, progressive distal‑muscle wasting and weakness. The molecular etiology of Charcot‑Marie‑Tooth ‑GDAP1 disease has been elucidated but its pathogenesis remains unclear, especially given the seemingly contradictory function of the GDAP1 protein. Expression of GDAP1 is observed almost exclusively in neuronal cells, however, the GDAP1 protein is present in mitochondria, where it plays a role in fission, a ubiquitous process occurring in all cells. While GDAP1 contains two glutathione S‑transferase (GST) domains, its GST activity is in fact very limited. Additionally, despite GDAP1 affecting mitochondrial functionality, and hence being of great importance to cellular function, the GDAP1‑associated Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is mainly characterized by axonal degeneration. Finally, mutations in the GDAP1 gene may be inherited in a recessive or dominant manner. Given the way such varied observations are hard to reconcile with one another, the investigation of GDAP1 is at one and the same time a difficult but also challenging endeavour. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current knowledge on the GDAP1 protein and its function in the cell. A further part is the characterization of GDAP1‑associated Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, its symptoms and course, as well as an outlining of the possible mechanisms underpinning the disorder.",

    "abstract": "Cadmium, a heavy metal with no physiological function in the human body, is considered a bio-hazard. It is also considered to be a potent neurotoxin. The primary sources of cadmium exposure are diet and cigarette smoke. It has been postulated that nutritional deficiencies can increase the risk of cadmium toxicity. Nuts provide essential nutrients which are necessary for the maintenance of brain health in humans. The present study was designed to investigate the possible protective effects of almond and walnut supplementation on cadmium-induced neurotoxicity. Cadmium was orally administered at a dose of 50 mg/kg weekly with or without the supplementation of almond and walnut in rats. Intensities of depression‑ and anxiety-related behaviors were assessed by the forced swim test and light/dark transition test, respectively. Memory function was also evaluated by the elevated plus maze, Morris water maze and novel object recognition task. After four weeks of treatment it was observed that cadmium administration significantly induced depressogenic and anxiogenic behaviors. Memory function was also impaired by cadmium administration. Cadmium-treated rats exhibited reduced noradrenalin, dopamine and serotonin levels in the brain, whereas the levels of their respective metabolites were significantly increased. The dietary supplementation of almond and walnut at a dose of 400 mg/kg/day significantly attenuated cadmium-induced depression, anxiety and memory impairments. Neurochemical aberrations also normalized following supplementation with these nuts in rats. The present study demonstrates that long-term supplementation with almond and walnut provides essential nutrients which may overcome nutritional deficiencies and thereby reduce heavy-metal intoxication.",

    "abstract": "Autism is characterized by impairment in reciprocal communication and speech, repetitive behaviors, and social communication. The genetic and environmental factors play roles in the pathogenesis of autism. It was recently shown that the genes involved in the folate/homocysteine pathway may be risk factors for autistic children. One of the genes that may be the risk factor for autism is Methionine synthase (MTR). MTR is responsible for the regeneration of methionine from homocysteine. The aim of this study was to analyze the association of MTR A2756G gene polymorphism (rs1805087) and the risk of autism in a population in northern Iran. The prevalence of MTR A2756G polymorphism was determined in 108 children with autism and 130 controls in northern Iran. Genotypes and allele frequencies were determined in patients and controls by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The prevalence of genotype frequencies of AA, AG and GG in autistic children were 57.41%, 22.22% and 20.37%, respectively, while in controls were 61.54%, 32.31% and 6.15%, respectively. There was significant difference between the MTR polymorphism distribution in control and patient groups. The prevalence of allele frequencies of A and G in autistic children were 0.69 and 0.31, respectively and in controls were 0.78 and 0.22, respectively (P=0.03). The MTR G allele conferred a 1.6-fold increased risk to autism relative to the A allele (95% CI=1.06-2.41, P=0.02). The present study suggests that the G allele of MTR A2756G polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of autism.",

Many studies have evaluated the relationship between vitamin E intake or vitamin E levels in body fluids and neurodegenerative diseases. Some studies concluded that vitamin E can play a protective role in neurodegeneration with respect to diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), stroke and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Vitamin E supplementation was also associated with risk factors for some neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss the possible effects of vitamin E on the development and course of AD, PD, stroke and ALS, and the potential mechanisms involved.",

    "abstract": "The autonomic nervous system regulates internal organs and peripheral circulation, which enables the maintenance of homeostasis in vertebrate species. One of the brain regions involved in autonomic and endocrine homeostasis regulation is the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). The PVN is a unique site at which multiple input signals can be assessed and integrated. The regulation of the autonomic system by the PVN and, especially, the sympathetic flow, depends upon the integration of inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitter action. The excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate and angiotensin II, and inhibitory neurotransmitters such as γ‑aminobutyric acid and nitric oxide, play a key role in the physiological function of the PVN. Moreover, arginine-vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OXT) are important in the regulation of sympathetic system activity. The PVN is also crucial for maintaining cardiovascular regulation, with its integrity being pivotal for blood pressure regulation. Studies have shown that pre‑autonomic sympathetic PVN neurons increase blood pressure and the dysfunction of these neurons is directly related to elevated sympathetic nervous system activity under hypertension. Etiology of hypertension in patients is not fully known. Thus, understanding the role of PVN in the generation of hypertension may help to treat this cardiovascular disease. This review focuses on the PVN's inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitter interactions that regulate sympathetic system activity in physiological conditions and hypertension.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune illness characterized by demyelination and neurodegeneration, which causes physical disability and severe alterations in the neurological system, including gliosis and neuron loss. The disease primarily affects myelinated parts of the central nervous system (CNS), such as the optic nerves, cerebellum, brain stem, and spinal cord. T cells play an important role in MS pathogenesis by inducing demyelination, and risk factors include genetic predisposition, environmental effects, and lifestyle decisions. The prevalence of MS is rising, especially among women and the elderly population. Iron dysregulation is a critical element in MS pathogenesis, with excess iron causing neurodegeneration via ferroptosis and immune response modulation. Excess iron amplifies inflammation by triggering the activation of macrophages with inflammatory properties, and promoting microglial polarization toward the pro‑inflammatory phenotype. This causes increased oxidative stress, mitochondrial malfunction, and the release of reactive oxygen species, which harm neurons. Furthermore, proinflammatory cytokines like IL‑6 regulate iron metabolism and encourage the formation of Th17 cells, which exacerbates CNS inflammation. Macrophages and microglia, which are implicated in inflammatory responses, collect iron during MS, exacerbating neuroinflammation and demyelination. Disrupted iron homeostasis is a major contributor to MS pathology, with iron deficiency affecting immunological function and changing T‑cell responses, both of which are necessary for disease progression. Lumbar puncture, oligoclonal bands analysis, and magnetic resonance imaging are all used to diagnose MS and confirm disease activity and progression. The blood‑brain barrier is frequently disrupted in MS, allowing the influx of inflammatory cells. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the cause‑effect relationship between the amount of iron and the health status of patients with MS.",

The advent of whole-scalp MEG systems allowing rapid non-invasive recording from the entire cortex and accurate localisation of neural sources, and the development of refined signal analysis methods are important factors that led to an increasing interest in studies of sensorimotor oscillations during the last 10 years. Investigations on healthy subjects revealed frequency-specific localisation and modality-specific reactivity of 10 Hz and 20 Hz sensorimotor oscillations. Task-specific coherence between motor cortical and electromyographic oscillations, reflecting cortico-motoneuronal coupling, point towards a functional role of precentral oscillations in the cortical control of voluntary movements. Furthermore, abnormal cortico-motoneuronal coupling may underlie clinical symptoms of motor disorders, such as tremor. Thus, investigation of oscillatory sensorimotor activity proceeds from phenomenology to function and provides an interesting approach to address questions in human motor physiology and pathophysiology.",

However, several arguments (and much of the evidence) in favour of this hypothesis do not bear closer examination. On the other hand, evidence is accumulating that, after transient ischemia, calcium fluxes through ionotropic glutamate receptors of the non-NMDA type may play a major role in the manifestation of ischemic cell damage. Calcium fluxes through non-NMDA receptors are determined by mRNA editing of non-NMDA receptor subunits: calcium fluxes are blocked in the presence of an edited subunit. A possible role of mRNA editing in the development of ischemic cell damage is discussed.",

It is an unresolved problem in nonlinear EEG research that nonlinear methods per se give no feedback about the stationarity aspect. Hence, we introduce a combined strategy utilizing both stochastic and nonlinear deterministic methods. We propose, in a first step to segment the EEG time series into piecewise quasi-stationary epochs by means of nonparametric change point analysis.

Mechanisms whereby melatonin influences immune system function are complex, but include participation of mediators (endogenous opioids, cytokines, hormones, zinc pool) as well as specific binding sites on the immune cells. Melatonin, as a highly lyophilic compound, may also penetrate immune cells without mediation of specific receptors and act within as a potent free radical scavenger and as an anti-aging and oncostatic factor. The immune system may, in turn, via synthesis and secretion of soluble factors, cytokines, influence pineal gland function, thereby closing the information loop to maintain homeostasis in order to face the harmful environment.",

A number of studies have characterized models of induced ischemic tolerance in which brief priming insults are demonstrated to result in reduced vulnerability to subsequent challenges. In the present study we have optimized a model of induced ischemic tolerance in the gerbil by carefully monitoring the duration of ischemic depolarization during each insult. Using this model we demonstrate that the threshold depolarization required to induce tolerance is comparable to those for induction of several transcription factor mRNAs, while mRNA encoding the heat shock protein, hsp72, is strongly induced only after more severe insults that approach the threshold for ischemic neuronal injury.",

We found, in agreement with Angel's (1973) original study, that for auditory stimuli higher intensity is accompanied by a larger force. Surprisingly, in the case of visual stimuli the intensity does not influence the force. These findings are explained by the assumption that the changes of force reflect the changes of unspecific activation level evoked by immediate arousal. Thus, the different behaviour of force for these two modalities is in agreement with the common view that loud auditory stimuli are arousing while intense visual ones are not.",

Therefore, the change of A beta biology in Alzheimer's disease (as well as in a number of other human pathologies, including cardiovascular disease, neuromuscular junction disorders, NPC and Down's syndrome) may represent a physiological mechanism to compensate for impaired brain structure or function. In our own recent study A beta 1-40 rescued long term potentiation (LTP, a major model for activity-dependent CNS plasticity), while cholesterol synthesis inhibition abolished the restorative action of the A beta peptide. This study confirms that A beta protein is a functional player in synaptic structure-functional plasticity and in cholesterol neurochemical pathways. The article also calls for a need to critically re-evaluate a universal belief that transgenic mice with a transgene for amyloid-beta protein precursor (A beta PP) are a true model for Alzheimer's type neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "While glutamatergic transmission is severely altered by early degeneration of cortico-cortical connections and hippocampal projections in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the role of glutamate receptors in the pathogenesis of AD is not yet defined clearly. Nonetheless, as reviewed here, the topographical distribution of different types of receptors likely contributes to the regional selective nature of neuronal degeneration. In particular, metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) may contribute the pathogenesis of many neurological conditions and also regulate neuronal vulnerability against cytotoxic stress. Thus, we here discuss the possible role of mGluR in the pathogenesis of AD based on the results from other neurodegenerative diseases that may give us clues to solve the mysterious selective neurodegeneration evident in AD.",

    "abstract": "The present study investigated effects of human umbilical cord blood derived CD34+ cells on sensorimotor, cognitive, and histological outcome in rats following focal cerebral ischemia. Halothane anesthetized adult male Wistar rats were subjected to transient or permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) followed by intravenous administration of CD34+ cells (5 × 105 or 2 × 106) after 24 h recovery. The beam-walking and cylinder tests were used to assess sensorimotor function, and Morris water-maze examined cognitive performance during a 25 day follow-up period. Subsequently, rats were perfused for measurement of infarct volumes and detection of CD34+ cells in the brain by immunohistochemistry (MAB1281). MCAO rats showed minor or no spontaneous recovery in sensorimotor function during the follow-up. The recovery profile was similar in MCAO controls and in MCAO rats that received CD34+ cells, although CD34+ cells seemed to improve the use of impaired forelimb. There was also a trend toward improved water-maze performance by CD34+ cells in transient MCAO rats. Infarct volumes assessed from Nissl-stained sections on postoperative day 25 did not differ between the experimental groups. MAB1281-positive cells were not detected in the brain of MCAO rats that received CD34+ cells. The present study suggests that CD34+ cells might improve functional outcome in MCAO rats after systemic administration, but do not significantly provide neuroprotection.

    "abstract": "The face is one of the most important stimuli carrying social meaning. Thanks to the fast analysis of faces, we are able to judge physical attractiveness and features of their owners' personality, intentions, and mood. From one's facial expression we can gain information about danger present in the environment. It is obvious that the ability to process efficiently one's face is crucial for survival. Therefore, it seems natural that in the human brain there exist structures specialized for face processing. In this article, we present recent findings from studies on the neuronal mechanisms of face perception and recognition in the light of current theoretical models. Results from brain imaging (fMRI, PET) and electrophysiology (ERP, MEG) show that in face perception particular regions (i.e. FFA, STS, IOA, AMTG, prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex) are involved. These results are confirmed by behavioral data and clinical observations as well as by animal studies. The developmental findings reviewed in this article lead us to suppose that the ability to analyze face-like stimuli is hard-wired and improves during development. Still, experience with faces is not sufficient for an individual to become an expert in face perception. This thesis is supported by the investigation of individuals with developmental disabilities, especially with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD).",

Increase in expression of mRNA coding for various chemokines including CCL3 and CCL4 has been often detected with global transcriptome profiling of brain tissue following epileptogenic stimuli as well as in epilepsy in experimental models and in human patients. Despite this, little is known about the expression of these proteins in epileptogenesis or epilepsy. In the present work CCL3 and CCL4 mRNA and protein expression were studied in the amygdala stimulation model of temporal lobe epilepsy using quantitiative PCR and immunohistochemistry. Expression of CCL3 and CCL4 mRNA in the block of tissue containing enthorinal and piriform cortices, amygdala and piriform nucleus was markedly up-regulated at 1, 4, 14 and 30 days following stimulation and in hippocampal CA1 was significantly increased at 1 and 4 days following stimulation. Expression of CCL3 and CCL4 proteins was elevated in astrocytes in the enthorinal and piriform cortices, amygdala, and hippocampus showing the largest increase at 4D after status epilepticus. Increase in mRNA and protein levels of CCL3 and CCL4 in the animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy suggests their role in disease development or recovery form epileptogenic insult. Existence of multiple targets for these chemokines in the damaged brain allows several possibilities of influencing neuronal and glial functions.",

Yet, despite vast research in this field, exact neurophysiological mechanism of rTMS therapy still remains unclear. This results in difficulties choosing suitable rTMS parameters in advance and compromises thorough evaluation of efficacy after the treatment. In order to obtain more explicit assessment of rTMS therapy in the psychiatric field, we evaluated and compared the influence of two most widely used antidepressive rTMS protocols on EEG band power spectrum and relation to clinical test scores (MADRS, BDI, HAM-D17). Forty-five patients (12 male, 33 female, mean age 52.16 years) participated in the study. Twenty-three patients received high frequency (10 Hz) stimulation, the rest 22 were stimulated using low frequency (1 Hz) protocol. Both groups received 10 to 15 daily rTMS sessions. EEG recordings and clinical tests were obtained the day before rTMS course and same day after the last session. Majority (57.78%) of patients showed considerable improvement after the treatment. There were no notable differences in clinical test score drop between the two rTMS protocols. However, we found that different protocols resulted in significantly different electrophysiological changes. High frequency (10 Hz) rTMS resulted in widespread changes off EEG band power, including delta power increase on the left hemisphere and alpha power growth on the right. Theta power increase was also obtained in parietal-occipital areas. Low frequency (1 Hz) rTMS showed to have no major effect on basic EEG band power, however, we found a notable shift of frontal alpha power asymmetry towards the right hemisphere, which correlated with the clinical outcome. Our study results suggest that two widely used rTMS protocols strongly differ in their electrophysiological mechanisms. Low frequency stimulation finesse on frontal alpha power asymmetry shift, whereas high frequency protocol acts on wider electrophysiological changes in the brain.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate therapeutic effectiveness of intra-arterial infusion of human umbilical cord blood (HUCB) derived cells at different stages of their neural conversion. Freshly isolated mononuclear cells (D-0), neurally directed progenitors (D-3) and neural-like stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood (NSC) were compared. Focal brain damage was induced in rats by stereotactic injection of ouabain into dorsolateral striatum Three days later 107 of different subsets of HUCB cells were infused into the right internal carotid artery. Following surgery rats were housed in enriched environment for 30 days. Behavioral assessment consisted of tests for sensorimotor deficits (walking beam, rotarod, vibrissae elicited forelimb placing, apomorphine induced rotations), cognitive impairments (habit learning and object recognition) and exploratory behavior (open field). Thirty days after surgery the lesion volume was measured and the presence of donor cells was detected in the brain at mRNA level. At the same time immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissue was performed to estimate the local tissue response of ouabain injured rats and its modulation after HUCB cells systemic treatment. Functional effects of different subsets of cord blood cells shared substantial diversity in various behavioral tests. An additional analysis showed that D-0 HUCB cells were the most effective in functional restoration and reduction of brain lesion volume. None of transplanted cord blood derived cell fractions were detected in rat’s brains at 30th day after treatment. This may suggest that the mechanism(s) underlying positive effects of HUCB derived cell may concern the other than direct neural cell supplementation. In addition increased immunoreactivity of markers indicating local cells proliferation and migration suggests stimulation of endogenous reparative processes by HUCB D-0 cell interarterial infusion.",

Mice in late gestation (day 16-17) were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Treatment of pregnant mice with high doses of LPS resulted in fetal resorption or stillbirths. Pregnant mice treated with low doses (100 or 300 micrograms/kg) of LPS gave birth to normal numbers of pups. However, behavior of the offspring was altered. Adult offspring of dams injected at a dose of 300 micrograms/kg of LPS traveled longer distances in the open field and spent more time in the central part of the arena, than mice in the control group. Female mice of this group spent more time in open arms of the elevated plus maze, in comparison to female control mice. Results of the Morris water maze test showed impairment of spatial learning and memory in male offspring born to LPS-injected dams. Furthermore, in the nest building test adult mice born from LPS challenged pregnancies constructed worse quality nests, which points to the presence of hippocampal dysfunction. These findings indicate that maternal bacterial infections during pregnancy may alter offspring behavior in adult life.",

Hyperlipidemia and cigarette smoking are two factors that have been implicated in endothelial damage. The high comorbidity between cardiovascular disease and major depression disorder (MDD) prompted us to study the effect of cigarette smoking, hyperlipidemia and statin treatment on the VEGFA mRNA and protein expression levels measured in MDD patients. We analyzed 38 MDD patients and 38 healthy control individuals and observed that the MDD group had a significantly higher VEGFA mRNA level and protein serum concentration (P is equal 0.001; P is less than 0.001, respectively). We found no significant association between VEGFA expression at the mRNA or protein level and cigarette smoking, hyperlipidemia or treatment with statins (P is greater than 0.05). Interestingly, patients who had attempted suicide had a lower VEGF serum level compared with patients who had not attempted suicide. The translational value of this finding remains unknown. A higher VEGF concentration may play a potentially significant role in the pathogenesis of depression, and the expression level appears to be unaffected by additional factors.",

In the present study, we evaluated whether BDNF administration can affect KCC2/NKCC1 expression, ictogenesis and behavioral alterations in this paradigm. Status epilepticus was induced in male rats with pilocarpine, followed by a treatment of either a single high dose or multiple injections of BDNF during the latent phase of temporal lobe epilepsy. Chloride transporters expression, spontaneous recurrent seizures, and hyperexcitability post-seizural behaviors were evaluated after treatment. NKCC1 protein expression was markedly upregulated, whereas that of KCC2 was significantly downregulated in epileptic hippocampi compared to intact controls. Application of BDNF (both single high dose and multiple injections) increased KCC2 expression in epileptic hippocampi, while NKCC1 expression was downregulated exclusively by the single high dose injection of BDNF. Development of spontaneous recurrent seizures was delayed but not prevented by the treatment, and hyperexcitability behaviors were ameliorated for a short period of time. To prevent GABA-A mediated depolarization and design appropriate treatment strategies for temporal lobe epilepsy, chloride transporters can be considered as a target. Future studies are warranted to investigate any possible therapeutic effects of BDNF via altering chloride transporters expression.",

In addition to this, we examined basal plasma corticosterone level as well as brain-derived neurothropic factor (BDNF) in the PSG and MAMG rats. The effect of prenatal stress (stress paradigm between 14 and 21 day of gestation) and methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) administration (17 day of gestation) to the female Wistar rats were studied on the male offspring in the Morris Water Maze (spatial memory) and locomotor activity test. Through Morris Water Maze rats were injected with saline 4 times (on 1, 7, 14 and 21 day of testing) while in locomotor activity test saline was injected only once. Corticosterone level was measured using ELISA Kit while BDNF levels were assessed using ELISA Chemikine TM BDNF kit. Results indicate that both PSG and MAMG rats deteriorate spatial memory as well as increase locomotor activity compared to the control group. Biochemical studies indicate that basal plasma corticosterone level increased in both PSG and MAMG rats compared to the control group. Analyses of the BDNF level, on the other hand, have shown decrease of the neurothropin level in both hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) in both PSG and MAMG groups of rats. As shown by the obtained results, both the prenatal stress model and prenatal MAM administration model generate a number of behavioural (e.g. spatial memory disorders, increased locomotor activity) and biochemical (e.g. increased corticosterone and decreased BDNF levels) changes in the examined offspring, Thus, these models can be successfully used in the efficacy analysis of the pharmacotherapy applied.",

Although eCBs exert many of their actions on spatial learning and memory via CB1 receptors, the putative cannabinoid receptor GPR55 (expressed in the hippocampus, cortex, forebrain, cerebellum and striatum) seems to be also involved. To investigate the potential role of GPR55 in spatial learning and memory, Wistar rats received bilateral infusions of lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI, GPR55‑agonist) into the hippocampus 5‑minutes before training‑phase in the Barnes‑maze (BM). This manipulation increased the use of serial navigation while preventing the learning of spatial navigation strategy and decreasing the use of random activity to find the escape‑tunnel in the BM. In contrast, CID16020046 (GPR55‑antagonist) increased the use of random activity at the expense of spatial and serial navigation strategies. Finally, CID16020046 significantly reduced the time spent in the target zone during a retention test. Our results suggest: (i) a potential role of GPR55 in developing navigation strategies; (ii) a prospective function for LPI acting in hippocampal CA1 (probably via GPR55) to perform a serial navigation strategy; and (iii) a potential role of GPR55 in the mechanisms involved in spatial memory (object placement memory).",

In this study, we evaluated the effect of combined therapy of curcumin and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) on behavioral recovery and tissue sparing, glial scar formation, axonal sprouting and inflammatory responses in a rat experimental model of spinal cord injury (SCI). Balloon-induced compression lesion was performed at thoracic (Th8-9) spinal level. Out of the four groups studied, two groups received curcumin on the surface of the spinal cord immediately after SCI and then once a week for 3 weeks together with an intraperitoneal daily curcumin injection for 28 days. The other two groups received saline. Seven days after SCI, human MSC were intrathecally implanted in one curcumin and one saline group. Both curcumin and curcumin combined with MSC treatment improved locomotor ability in comparison to the saline treated animals. The combined treatment group showed additional improvement in advanced locomotor performance. The combined therapy facilitated axonal sprouting, and modulated expression of pro-regenerative factors and inflammatory responses, when compared to saline and single treatments. These results demonstrate that preconditioning with curcumin, prior to the MSC implantation could have a synergic effect in the treatment of experimental SCI.",

A recent study indicated that EpoR and its activity are the downstream effectors of Klotho for cytoprotection in the kidney. Thus, we propose that Klotho can stimulate the expression of EpoR in neuronal cells to enhance Epo-mediated protection. H19-7 hippocampal neuronal cells were treated with recombinant Klotho. In H19-7 cells, Klotho increased the expression of both the EpoR protein and mRNA. Klotho also enhanced the transcription activity of the EpoR promoter in H19-7 cells. Moreover, Klotho augmented the Epo-triggered phosphorylation of Jak2 and Stat5 and protected H19-7 cells from hydrogen peroxide cytotoxicity. The silencing of EpoR abolished the protective effect of Klotho against peroxide-induced cytotoxicity. Finally, the silencing of GATA1 diminished the Klotho-induced increase in EpoR protein and mRNA expression as well as its promoter activity. In conclusion, Klotho increased EpoR expression in neuronal cells through GATA1, thereby enabling EpoR to function as a cytoprotective protein against oxidative injury.",

    "abstract": "Parkin and alpha-synuclein (α-syn) are two key proteins involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Oligomerization/aggregation and excessive secretion of α-syn contributes to PD through free radical stress, mitochondrial impairment, and synaptic dysfunction. Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is considered to be a pleiotropic, neuroprotective protein that modulates metabolic turnover and the accumulation of α-syn. This is in addition to parkin's role in counteracting the more distant effects of α-syn on cellular survival by altering proteasomal, autophagic, and calpain-mediated protein degradation pathways that can reduce α-syn levels. Moreover, parkin regulates mitochondrial turnover, cell survival, and immune phenomena - processes that are all known to be disturbed in PD. In addition, parkin might have an impact on the spreading and propagation of α-syn by controlling its post-translational modifications. On the other hand, recent research has shown that α-syn oligomers affect the expression, post-translational modification, and activity of parkin. This review focuses on the molecular mechanisms of cross-talk between parkin and α-syn in PD. The physical and functional interactions between α-syn and parkin, which have been incompletely characterized to-date, may present a new therapeutic avenue in PD and related synucleinopathies. The development of effective, clinically feasible modulators may offer great hopes for the the rapy of PD.",

The current study evaluates the potential role of the cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB)‑brain‑derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling pathway in mediating the neuroprotective effects of crocin against MPH‑induced neurotoxicity in rats. Seventy adult male rats were randomly divided into seven groups. Group 1 and 2 received 0.7 ml/rat of normal saline and 10 mg/kg of MPH, respectively. Groups 3, 4, 5, and 6 were treated simultaneously with MPH (10 mg/kg) and crocin (10, 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg, respectively) for 21 days. Group 7 was treated with crocin (80 mg/kg) alone for 21 days. The Morris water maze (MWM) and open field test were used to assess cognitive and locomotor activities. Hippocampal neurotoxicity parameters and levels of BDNF and CREB were evaluated. Simultaneous treatment with various doses of crocin reduced the MPH‑induced cognition disturbances and hyperlocomotion. In addition, lipid peroxidation increased with MPH treatment and levels of the oxidized forms of glutathione (GSSG), interleukin 1 beta (IL‑1β), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF‑α), and Bax increased. MPH treatment decreased levels of the reduced form of glutathione (GSH), P‑CREB, Bcl‑2, and BDNF in the hippocampus. MPH also reduced activity of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase in the hippocampus. In contrast, crocin attenuated MPH‑induced oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, and increased levels of P‑CREB and BDNF. Thus, crocin - likely via stimulation of the P‑CREB/BDNF signaling pathway - displayed neuroprotection against MPH‑induced neurotoxicity.",

Hepcidin is a peptide hormone responsible for systemic iron homeostasis and simultaneously the inflammatory response protein, induced in response to interleukin 6 (IL-6). We assessed the serum concentration of hepcidin and IL-6 in the groups of patients with PD treated only pharmacologically with optimal individualized therapy (MT) and treated additionally with deep brain stimulation (DBS), compared to the control group. The serum concentrations of hepcidin and IL-6 in the group of all PD patients were significantly higher than in the control group. In the group of PD patients treated with DBS hepcidin and IL-6 concentrations were significantly higher compared to the control group. Additionally, the positive correlations between serum hepcidin and IL-6 were found in the PD (MT and DBS) and PD-DBS group. The obtained results may indicate the influence of immunological mechanisms on iron metabolism and oxidative stress, in particular when the inflammatory process is more active in the DBS-treated group. This effect can be protective as well as neurodegenerative.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder, affecting communication and behavior. Historically, ASD had been described as a purely psychiatric disorder with genetic factors playing the most critical role. Recently, a growing body of literature has been emphasizing the importance of environmental and immunological factors in its pathogenesis, with the autoimmune process attracting the most attention. This study provides a review of the autoimmune involvement in the pathogenesis of ASD. The\\r\\nmicrobiome, the representative of the innate immune system in the central nervous system (CNS), plays a critical role in triggering inflammation. Besides, a bidirectional communicational pathway between the CNS and the intestine called the gut‑brain‑axis is linked to the development of ASD. Moreover, the higher plasma level of pro‑inflammatory cytokines in ASD patients and the higher prevalence of autoimmune disorders in the first‑degree family members of affected persons are other clues of the immune system involvement in\\r\\nthe pathogenesis of ASD. Furthermore, some anti‑inflammatory drugs, including resveratrol and palmitoylethanolamide have shown promising effects by relieving the manifestations of ASD. Although considerable advances have been made in elucidating the role of autoimmunity in the ASD pathogenesis, further studies with stronger methodologies are needed to apply the knowledge to the definitive treatment of ASD.",

In the present work it is investigated whether sleep spindles and spike-wave discharges are also sensitive for the same drugs. Adult male WAG/Rij rats were chronically implanted with frontal and occipital EEG electrode pairs. Rats were intraperitoneally injected with clonidine (0.00625 mg/kg), phenobarbital (20 mg/kg), flunitrazepam (0.188 mg/kg). Frontal and occipital sleep spindles and mainly frontal spike-wave discharges were seen in the electroencephalogram. Phenobarbital and flunitrazepam reduced the number of spike-wave discharges and enhanced frontal sleep spindles, while clonidine facilitated spike-wave discharges and reduced frontal sleep spindles. The results of these three drugs indicate a reciprocal relationship between the number of frontal sleep spindles and the number of spike-wave discharges. Only clonidine facilitated occipital sleep spindles without an effect on spike-wave discharges. It can be concluded that frontal and occipital sleep spindles have a different pharmacological profile. Furthermore, the inverse relationship between frontal sleep spindles and spike-wave discharges may suggest that sleep spindles and spike-wave discharges are controlled by a single controlling system. However, in order to explain the clonidine data on occipital sleep spindles another factor must be incorporated in properties of the mechanism(s) involved in EEG oscillations.",

Co-incident with the reduced energy metabolism during the development of the disease, some of the key mitochondrial enzymes have shown deficient activity in AD neurons, which may lead to increased ROS production. However, we found that oxidative damage occurs primarily within the cytoplasm rather than in mitochondria. Given that SOD activity is increased in AD mitochondria and that metal ions such as iron and copper are enriched in susceptible neurons, we hypothesize that mitochondria, as a source, provide hydrogen peroxide, which, as an intermediate, once in the cytoplasm, will be converted into highly reactive hydroxyl radicals through Fenton reaction in the presence of metal ion and cause damage in cytoplasm.",

Younger and older subject grouped together the beats generated by a metronome. Subjects were asked to listen to the beats of a metronome and to accentuate mentally every second, third, fourth...etc. beat, to create a subjective rhythm. This rhythm exists, in fact, only in subjects' mind and not objectively. Subjects reported verbally how many clicks they were able to integrate into a perceptual unit. On this basis, the time interval during which subjects were able to integrate temporally separated stimuli was calculated (number of beats reported as being integrated x time distance between beats) for different metronome frequencies. The results show, firstly, that the length of integration periods significantly depends on the frequency of presented metronome beats. When the frequency of metronome beats is high, the time interval during which the subjects integrate beats into a single perceptual unit is shorter. Secondly, older adults integrate information during a longer time interval than younger ones. Thirdly, the length of an integration period is related to a subjects' level of cognitive ability. These results suggest that the length of an integration period is not a constant, stable feature, but varies across the life span depending on the mental content of the information presented and individual factors.",

Parallel measurement of HR changes and changes of local intensity of blood flow as indexed by fMRI in a procedure eliciting emotions allowed us to pinpoint areas of the brain responsible for HR variations during emotional arousal. In condition eliciting positive emotions we detected activation of occipito-temporal regions, anterior insula, and hypothalamus. In condition eliciting negative emotions we also detected activation of occipito-temporal regions and additionally activation of bilateral anterior insulae, right amygdala and right superior temporal gyrus. The results show that structures constituting neural network involved in HR control during emotional arousal are affect specific. Particularly the central circuit controlling HR in negative affect includes the amygdala, while central circuit controlling HR in positive affect includes the hypothalamus. Additionally activation of bilateral occipito-temporal cortex proves enhancement of visual processing of emotional material as compared to neutral material in both positive and negative affect. This might be attributed to top-down processes originating in the frontal lobe and related to shifting attention to the emotionally relevant stimuli. Activation of insular cortex is probably related to autonomic arousal accompanying watching emotional content (e.g. sweating, heart-rate changes etc.). Activation of the amygdala in the negative condition supports the well documented engagement of this structure in processing of fear and disgust.",

    "abstract": "Chronic stress and/or glucocorticoid administration produces atrophy of hippocampal neurons. However, evidence of the impact of glucocorticoids on glial cells, especially in both males and females, is limited. In the present study, we investigated the total percentage body weight, hippocampal volume and hippocampal astrocyte numbers following chronic corticosterone treatment in male and female Wistar rats. Males had greater left and right hippocampal volumes overall, but no effect on hippocampal volume was seen after corticosterone treatment. Total body weight was dose-dependently lower in both sexes, but the decrease was more prominent in male rats. Corticosterone treatment dose-dependently increased astrocyte numbers in the CA1 region, but not in the lateral and medial CA3 hippocampal regions. This increase was similar in both male and female rats. The astrogliosis observed following chronic corticosterone may have implications for extrasynaptic communication and neuron-glia interactions and is similar to changes in the astrocytic population observed in aged rats.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study is to understand the basic relationship between swimming exercise and natural course of epilepsy in animals by performing an electrophysiological study. For this purpose, male Wistar rats were submitted to daily swimming exercise program of three different durations. Animals were swim-exercised for 90 days with either 15 minutes, 30 minutes or 60 minutes/day. Thereafter, the epileptiform activity was induced by a single microinjection of penicillin (500 units) into the left somatomotor cortex. Short-duration swimming exercise (15 min per day for 90 days) decreased the mean frequency and amplitude of penicillin-induced epileptiform activity in the 70 and 90 minutes after penicillin injection compared to penicillin administered group, respectively. Moderate-duration (30 min per day for 90 days) and long-duration (60 min per day for 90 days) swimming exercise did not alter either the frequency or amplitude of epileptiform activity. The results of the present study provide electrophysiologic evidence that short-duration swimming exercise partially inhibits penicillin-induced epileptiform activity. These data also suggest that moderate and long-duration swimming exercise do not increase either the frequency or severity of seizure in the model of penicillin-induced epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Working memory is an ability to keep information in short-term memory and manipulate them “on line”. Working memory is also involved in complex frontal executive functions. The role of dopaminergic system in modulating working memory processes in prefrontal cortex is well established. Also the role of serotoninergic receptors is postulated. The purpose of this study was to assess the association between the polymorphisms of dopaminergic (DRD1, DRD3, DRD4, COMT) and serotoninergic (SERT – serotonin transporter, 5HT2A, 5HT2C) genes’ polymorphisms and performance on WCST in 200 volunteers from the Polish population. We found the association between DRD1, DRD4, COMT and SERT genes polymorphisms and the performance on WCST. The results obtained in the study indicate that dopaminergic and serotoninergic genes may play a role in modulating the executive function and working memory processes in healthy subjects. The pattern of this influence may be different in males and females. Moreover, the relationship between the efficacy of prefrontal cognitive function and genes polymorphisms may differ between healthy subjects and schizophrenic patients.",

The purpose of this study was to examine evidence of the association between hyperandrogenism and autistic traits (ATs) among subjects diagnosed with an ASD, and to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-androgen therapy as a means to help treat ATs in subjects diagnosed with an ASD. Evidence of hyperandrogenism in subjects diagnosed with an ASD is supported by multiple studies in the areas of psychological framework, brain pathology, tissue culture, and pre- and postnatal androgen levels. Data from subjects diagnosed with other conditions associated with elevated androgens reveals many of these individuals have ATs. Finally, in a placebo-controlled trial of testosterone administration to neurotypical subjects, testosterone was found to increase ATs. In addition, a controlled trial of human transsexuals revealed a significant increase in ATs in female-to-male transsexuals and a decrease in ATs in male-to-female transsexuals. Data from multiple animals and human clinical trials suggest that antiandrogen medications have the ability to significantly reduce ATs in patients diagnosed with an ASD. In light of the robust association between hyperandrogenism and ASD, it is recommended subjects diagnosed with an ASD should undergo routine screening for elevated androgens, and appropriate treatment should be initiated for those with elevated androgens.",

Ouabain, a Na/K ATPase pump inhibitor, was stereotactically injected into the right striatum of Wistar rats. One week later, the superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)-labeled rat BMSCs (n=7) or vehicle (n=8) were stereotactically transplanted into the left striatum. Using rotarod test, motor function was serially evaluated through the experiment. A 7.0-T MR apparatus was employed to serially monitor the migration of BMSCs in the host brain. Histological analysis was performed at 7 weeks after ouabain injection, i.e., 6 weeks after BMSC transplantation. Ouabain injection yielded the reproducible, focal lesion in the right striatum, causing continuous motor dysfunction throughout the experiment. BMSC transplantation significantly enhanced the recovery of motor function after ouabain injection. MR imaging demonstrated that the BMSCs aggressively migrated towards the lesion through the corpus callosum. Histological analysis supported the findings on MRI. The BMSCs significantly enhanced the neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) on both sides. Some of them also expressed neuronal or astrocytic phenotypes in the neocortex, SVZ, corpus callosum, and peri-lesion area. These findings strongly suggest that the BMSCs may serve therapeutic impacts on lacunar stroke when stereotactically transplanted at clinically relevant timing.",

    "abstract": "It is well established that the majority of headache and other trigeminal nerve-associated disorders have higher prevalence in females than in males. However, the pathogenesis of many chronic trigeminal pain conditions, such as trigeminal neuralgia, migraine and temporo-mandibular disorders, is still not known. One of the proposed mechanisms involve calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which is considered the most important neuropeptide in the trigeminal system. In various animal models of trigeminal nerve-associated disorders concentration of CGRP has been shown to be increased in trigeminal ganglia (TG). Moreover, intraganglionic release of CGRP has been shown to modulate neuronal transmission of pain signals. In most of these models, pathological changes in the trigeminal system are accompanied by inflammation within peripheral endings of TG neurons. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relation between gender and neurochemical changes in trigeminal ganglia evoked by peripheral inflammation, induced by Complete Freund Adjuvant (CFA) administration. Our studies show significant increase in CGRP expression in female mice, comparing to male mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate, that activation of trigeminal nociceptors by peripheral inflammation causes significant increase in expression of IL-1B, IL-6, TNF and BDNF in male mice, comparing to female mice. This phenomenon may be involved in clinically observed gender-dependent differences in the frequency of both migraine and other trigeminal nerve-related facial pain disorders.",

This region is involved in variety of behavioral tasks, including learning and memory. Our previous work showed that stress impaired function. The present work extends the earlier work to study mPFC in stressed and non-stressed rats with or without sertraline or curcumin treatments using stereological methods. Sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and curcumin is the main ingredient of turmeric with neuroprotective effects. In this study, 42 male rats were randomly assigned to seven groups: stress + distilled water, stress + olive oil, stress + curcumin (100 mg per kg per day), stress + sertraline (10 mg per kg per day), curcumin, sertraline, and control groups. After 56 days, the right mPFC was removed. The volume of mPFC and its subdivisions and the total number of neurons and glia were estimated. The results showed approx. 8 percent, approx. 8 percent, and 24 percent decrease in the volume of the mPFC and its prelimbic and infralimbic subdivisions, respectively. However, the anterior cingulated cortex remained unchanged. Also, the total number of the neurons and glial cells was significantly reduced (11 percent and 5 percent, respectively) in stress (+distilled water or olive oil) group in comparison to the non-stressed rats (P is less than 0.01). However, no significant reduction was observed in the volume of the mPFC and its subdivisions as well as the total number of the neurons and glial cells in stress + sertraline and stress + curcumin groups in comparison to the non-treated stressed rats (P is less than 0.01). The result indicated that treatment of rats with curcumin and sertraline could prevent the stress-induced changes in mPFC.",

At the moment, there is no clinically approved neuroprotective product for stroke but the consumption of plant polyphenols has been suggested to offer some protection against stroke. In this study, we investigated the effects of long-term consumption of fermented rooibos herbal tea (FRHT) on ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced brain injury in adult male Wistar rats. FRHT was administered to the animals ad libitum for 7 weeks prior to the induction of ischemic injury via a 20-minute bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries (BCCAO) followed by reperfusion for 24, 96 and 168 hours respectively. Neurobehavioural deficits, brain oedema, blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage, apoptosis, lipid peroxidation and total antioxidant capacity were subsequently evaluated using standard methods. Our results showed that long-term consumption of FRHT by Wistar rats signi icantly reduced brain oedema and neuronal apoptosis, but did not attenuate BBB damage following cerebral ischemia. Analysis of whole-brain homogenates showed significantly reduced lipid peroxidation levels, increased total antioxidant capacity and resulted in improved neurobehavioural outcomes in FRHT-treated rats when compared with untreated animals. Taken together, our results tend to suggest that continuous consumption of FRHT could confer some protection against ischemic brain injury (IBI) and is therefore highly recommended for patients with stroke-predisposing conditions.",

A mathematical analysis of grip strength is provided to quantify the regulation of the forces required in maintaining the grip of a moving object. These two behaviours were selected because the neural control of locomotion has been primarily studied for hind-limbs in cats and rodents, whereas hand grasp has been primarily studied in fore-limbs in human and non-human primates. When taken together, insight can be gleaned on the cutaneous regulation of movement as well as the role these afferents may play in mediating functional recovery following injury. We conclude that low-threshold mechanoreceptors are critical for normal motor function and for inducing plasticity in motor microcircuits following injury.",

Mammalian neurons of the central nervous system do not have the ability to regenerate. However, the cerebral cortex shows plasticity in certain cases. Motor or speech disorders due to frontal lobe brain damage can be improved with well-directed rehabilitation techniques. If such plasticity is possible, it raises the question whether specialized training could improve a cortical visual disorder. There is need for simple visual training which could be used in rehabilitation. A few different approaches have been developed to treat patients with hemianopia: (1) substitution including special devices, such as optical prisms; (2) compensation using intact residual abilities – especially training of eye movements; (3) restitution which is based on stimulating the blind hemifield. The third method of rehabilitation is the most controversial; however, it has the largest potential. To support concepts of the targeted rehabilitation outlined here, first: further development of the theory of plasticity in visual pathways is required and second: the efficacy of the rehabilitation procedures has to be demonstrated by clinical evidence. We review methods and approaches of hemianopia rehabilitation and treatment. We also review results of contemporary clinical studies and meta-studies.",

The present work aims to evaluate the role of CCL3/MIP-1alpha in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced brain injury, and investigate whether the MAPKs and NF-kappaB regulate CCL3/MIP-1alpha expression. We firstly examined the patterns of CCL3/MIP-1alpha expression and phosphorylation of MAPKs in the brains of rats 6, 24, and 72 h after LPS administration. Additionally, LPS-treated rats were administered an anti-MIP-1alpha neutralizing antibody, and the microglial reaction and the expression of both cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were analyzed. We finally evaluated the effect of an inhibitor of P38 MAPK, an inhibitor of ERK1/2, or an inhibitor of NF-kappaB, on the levels of CCL3/MIP-1alpha protein and numbers of microglia in the brain. In the observation period, LPS induced CCL3/MIP-1alpha expression, which localized to OX-42-labeled microglia, leading to time-dependent increases in the phosphorylation of P38 MAPK and ERK1/2. The expression pattern of induced CCL3/MIP-1alpha was partly consistent with the phosphorylation of MAPKs (P38 MAPK, ERK1/2). Anti-MIP-1alpha attenuated microglial accumulation and the upregulation of cyclooxygenase-2 and iNOS. The inhibition of P38 MAPK, ERK1/2, or NF-kappaB signaling reduced the induced upregulation of CCL3/MIP-1alpha and the microglial accumulation. Our data suggest that upregulated CCL3/MIP-1alpha mediates the accumulation of microglia and the neuroinflammatory reaction, and its expression may be regulated by MAPKs and NF-kappaB in LPS-induced brain injury.",

Thus, to understand the side effects of DBS the connection of the STN should be well known. Therefore, the present study aims to re‑examine the STN with an emphasis on poorly‑ or un‑documented connections. Furthermore, the bilateral and interhemispheric connections of the STN are evaluated. Fifteen male albino rats received injections of Fluoro‑Gold retrograde and biotinylated dextran amine anterograde tracers into the STN. Following a 7-10 day survival period, the animals were processed according to the relevant protocol for each tracer. The present study demonstrates ipsilateral connections of the STN with cortical regions (i.e., infralimbic, cingulate, frontal, piriform, primary motor, primary sensory, insular and retrosplenial cortices), the endopiriform nucleus, basal ganglia related structures (i.e., caudate putamen, globus pallidus, ventral pallidum, nucleus accumbens, claustrum and substantia innominata) and the deep cerebellar nuclei (i.e., lateral, anterior interposed). Bilateral connections of the STN were observed with limbic (amygdala, bed nucleus of stria terminalis), hypothalamic (ventromedial, posterior, anterior, lateral and mammillary) thalamic (thalamic reticular nucleus), epithalamic (habenular nucleus), and brainstem structures (superior colliculus, substantia nigra, spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, red nucleus, dorsal raphe nucleus, pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei). Interhemispheric connections between left and right STN were also observed. The present study fills important gaps in connectivity of the STN. In particular, we report STN connectivity with cortical areas (i.e., piriform, endopiriform and insular), claustrum, hypothalamic, thalamic reticular, cerebellar, habenular, trigeminal, red, cuneate and gracile nuclei and substantia innominate. These connections, which have not been previously described or poorly described, provide new routes that can alter the conceptual architecture of the basal ganglia circuitry and may modify our view of the functional identity of the STN.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic plasticity simply put, is the activity‑dependent modification of the strength or efficacy of synaptic transmission in the network of synapses in the brain. The role of synaptic plasticity in disease is an active area of research. Changes in plasticity translate to the release of neurotransmitters at the synapse and subsequently, the way humans see the world. It is known that neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are related to pathological changes in dynamic processes in synapses, dialogue between neurons, and finally, changes in overall plasticity. To find a cure for these plasticity related diseases, it is imperative that we understand the precise mechanisms that perturb the homeostatic balance leading to the disease state. The aim of this review is to present what is currently known about DSCAM (Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule) a protein that is directly connected to pathological changes in synaptic plasticity. The review will present information on DSCAM and how it is connected to glutamate (Glu) and γ‑Aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission pathways. Finally, the review throws some light on the possible involvement of DSCAM in a spectrum of psychiatric disorders apart from Down syndrome (DS).",

    "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, resulting from progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Neuroprotective therapies in PD are still not available, perhaps because animal models do not imitate the chronic and progressive nature of the clinical state of PD. To address this, we performed a feasibility study aimed at establishing a chronic non-primate large animal PD model in Göttingen minipigs based on continuous infusion of the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Twelve female Göttingen minipigs were divided into groups of 2–4 animals and implanted with infusion pumps for continuous intramuscular MPTP delivery of 4–24 mg MPTP/day for 11 weeks. The animals showed parkinsonian symptoms with bradykinesia, rigidity, coordination and chewing difficulties. Symptoms were stable in the 12 and 18 mg MPTP/day groups, whereas the remaining groups showed partial or full behavioral recovery. Digital gait analysis, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) measurements and stereological counts of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH+) neurons in the SNc revealed a dose-related decrease in gait velocity, striatal metabolite levels and neuron numbers with increasing doses of MPTP. No neuronal inclusions were observed, but alpha-synuclein staining intensified with increased cumulative MPTP dosages. We conclude that this large-animal model of chronic MPTP administration in Göttingen minipigs shows trends of stable parkinsonian deficits at 18 mg MPTP/day in all modalities examined. This PD model shares many of the characteristics seen in patients and, although preliminary, holds considerable promise for future pre-clinical trials of neuroprotective therapies.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most typical chronic inflammatory, autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) which leads to physical dysfunction and paralysis in patients. A commonly used animal model for this disease is experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Daphnetin (7,8‑dihydroxycoumarin) has been reported to exert various pharmacological activities, such as being neuroprotective and anti‑inflammatory, together with having antioxidant, anticancer, and antiviral properties. Eight‑week‑old C57BL/6 female mice were segregated into 3 groups, namely 1) a control group receiving PBS, 2) a low‑dose treatment group receiving 2 mg/kg of daphnetin, and, 3) a high‑dose treatment group receiving 8 mg/kg of daphnetin. EAE was induced with a subcutaneous injection of a combination of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and complete Freund's adjuvant. On the day of induction, and again two days later, mice were injected intraperitoneally with pertussis toxin. Histological studies showed low lymphocyte infiltration and demyelination in the high and low dose treated groups. The ratio of spleen Treg cells and the levels of IL‑4, IL‑10, TGF‑β, and IL‑33 enhanced significantly in the treatment group related to the control group. Furthermore, both IL‑27 and IL‑35 were also enhanced significantly in the treatment group compared to the control group. Moreover, the levels of IFN‑γ, TNF‑α, and IL‑17 displayed a noticeable reduction in the daphnetin treated group. Daphnetin appears to improve the disease by increasing the expression of anti‑inflammatory cytokines and transcription factors (IL‑4, IL‑10, IL‑33, GATA3, TGF‑β, FoxP3), and reducing the production of pro‑inflammatory cytokines and transcription factors (IFN‑γ, STAT4, T‑bet, IL‑17, STAT3, ROR‑γt, TNF‑α).",

    "abstract": "As widely reported, dysregulated ferroptosis is closely associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD) progression. The goal of the present study was to probe the roles of long non‑coding RNA (lncRNA) nuclear enriched assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) in regulating ferroptosis in PD. PD cell model was constructed by subjecting SK‑N‑SH cells to 1‑methyl‑4‑phenylpyridinium (MPP+) for 24 h. The RNA levels of NEAT1, miRNA (miR)‑150‑5p and BRCA1‑associated protein 1 (BAP1) were evaluated using qRT‑PCR. The protein levels of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), BAP1 and solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) were determined using western blot. Cell viability was assessed using 3‑(4,5‑dimethylthiazolyl2)‑2, 5‑diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. In addition, fluorescent probe 2,7‑dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH‑DA) was employed to determine the ROS level. Moreover, the levels of GSH, MDA and Fe2+ were also measured. Finally, the interactions among NEAT1, miR‑150‑5p and BAP1 were identified by dual luciferase reporter gene assay, and/or RIP assay. Upregulated NEAT1 was observed in PD cell model. Knockdown of NEAT1 elevated viability and GSH level in PD cell model, and reduced ROS, MDA and Fe2+ levels. Moreover, NEAT1 functioned as a sponge to suppress miR‑150‑5p expression. Moreover, miR‑150‑5p overexpression suppressed ferroptosis in PD cell model. We subsequently found that miR‑150‑5p regulated SLC7A11 expression by directly binding to BAP1. miR‑150‑5p inhibition or BAP1 overexpression mitigated the anti‑ferroptosis effect meditated by sh‑NEAT1. Taken together, knockdown of NEAT1 mitigated MPP+‑induced ferroptosis through regulating BAP1/SLC7A11 axis by sponging miR‑150‑5p, indicating the potential of NEAT1 as a promising therapeutic target for PD.",

After behavioral assessments, brain tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities and GSH content, tumor necrosis factor‑α (TNF‑α), interleukin‑6 (IL‑6), IL‑1β, cortisol and brain‑derived neurotrophic factor levels and histological damage was assessed. CMS‑induced depression‑like outcomes with increases in anhedonia and decreases in cognitive measures that are rescued with both exercise models. The increased immobilization time in the Porsolt test was decreased with only WW. Exercise also normalized the suppression of antioxidant capacity and MPO increase induced by CMS in both exercise models. MDA levels also declined with both exercise models. Anxiety‑like behavior, cortisol levels, and histological damage scores were exacerbated with depression and improved by both exercise models. TNF‑α levels were depleted with both exercise models, and IL‑6 only with WW. WW was as protective as CE in CMS‑induced depression‑like cognitive and behavioral changes via suppressing inflammatory processes and improving antioxidant capacity.",

As of now, no preventive or therapeutic strategies are known to counteract nicotine‑induced neurodegeneration. In this study, we explore the neuroprotective effects of crocin, a bioactive agent commonly found in saffron – a spice derived from the flower of Crocus sativus – using a rat model. The dose‑dependent effects of crocin were evaluated in nicotine‑induced neurodegeneration and compared with a control group. Neurobehavioral changes, assessed through the elevated plus maze, the open field test, the forced swim test, and the Morris water maze, as well as oxidative stress in the hippocampus, were evaluated. Interestingly, nicotine administration resulted in depression, anxiety, and abnormal motor and cognitive functions, while crocin treatment protected the rat brain from these abnormalities. The beneficial effects of crocin were associated with reduced oxidative stress biomarkers such as malondialdehyde, along with increases in superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase activities. These results demonstrate that crocin can mitigate nicotine‑induced neurodegeneration by reducing oxidative stress, potentially offering a protective measure against neurodegenerative effects in smokers.",

In humans the pineal hormone melatonin has phase-shifting and resynchronising properties with regard to a number of circadian rhythms. Suitably timed melatonin administration hastened adaptation to phase shift and significantly improved self-rated jet lag in large numbers of time zone travellers. Preliminary results in night shift workers showed improved daytime sleep and night-time alertness. In simulated experiments, appropriately timed melatonin improved subjective sleep, alertness and performance and facilitated the readaptation of the melatonin rhythm following a rapid 9 h advance phase shift. Melatonin has also been assessed in circadian rhythm disorders with disturbed sleep (blindness and delayed sleep phase insomnia). Compared with placebo, melatonin significantly improved sleep and synchronised the sleep wake cycle in some blind subjects. Melatonin treatment significantly advanced the sleep onset time in delayed sleep phase insomnia. Taken together these findings suggest that melatonin is of benefit in facilitating adaptation to forced phase shifts and in conditions of circadian rhythm disturbance.",

    "abstract": "As in other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, neurons in prion diseases or transmisible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) die via programmed cell death of which the apoptotic process is relatively well characterized. A subcellular alteration linked to apoptosis is the formation of autophagic vacuoles, which we and others demonstrated in CJD- and scrapie-affected rodent brains. Autophagy may co-exist with apoptosis or may precede it and the process may be induced by apoptotic stimuli. Here, we extend these observations using different model of scrapie and CJD. Both scrapie models (the 263K and 22C-H) demonstrated autophagic vacuoles with the same frequency; hence, they will be described together. While the following changes had been observed simultaneously in different areas of the same sample, this description is organised as if it followed a sequence of events. First, a part of the neuronal cytoplasm was sequestrated by concentric arrays of membrane; that part of the cytoplasm closed by membranes appeared relatively normal but its density often appeared increased. Next, electron density of the central dramatically increased. Then, membranes proliferated within the cytoplasm in a labyrinth-like manner and an area sequestrated by these membranes enlarged and became more complex structure consisting of vacuoles, electron-dense area and areas of normally-looking cytoplasm connected with convoluted membranes. Finally, a large area of the cytoplasm was transformed into a collection of autophagic vacuoles of different sizes. Virtually identical alterations, albeit with much lower frequency, were seen in terminally ill CJD-affected hamsters.",

In studies on copulatory behaviour of male animals, elevated Fos immunoreactivity (related most probably to c-Fos) has been used by many researchers as a tool to reveal functional neuroanatomy of the behaviour. They found that brain regions such as medial preoptic area (MPOA), bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST), medial amygdala (MeAm) and central tegmental field (CTF) are always activated in a copulation-dependent manner in various species (rats and hamsters were the most often studied in this regard).

    "abstract": "Current views associate the reappearance of cell cycle markers with early events in Alzheimer's disease. Even though, the cell cycle was implicated early in the study of this disease, only recently has it been associated with selective early vulnerability of neurons. The pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease namely tau and amyloid have been associated with having effects on or being affected by cell cycle progression. Indeed the mitogenic component looms large early in the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Although quite a number of markers of reentry have been catalogued, the common denominator is abortosis, the unalterable march towards neuronal dysfunction, stasis and eventually death. We feel that complete understanding of the mechanisms, acting either positively by stimulation or through removal of inhibitory signals will provide promising molecular targets for pharmacological interventions which have been static for a number of years by being relegated to inhibition of the enzyme cholinesterase. In our opinion, investigating more proximal mechanisms will provide answers to changing the natural course of this illness.",

    "abstract": "The embryo develops from germ cell line (fertilized oocyte) and precursors of primordial germ cells (PGC) are the first population of stem cells that are specified in mice at the beginning of gastrulation in proximal primitive ectoderm (epiblast) &amp;#150; region adjacent to the extraembryonic ectoderm. These founder cells subsequently move through the primitive streak and give rise to several extra-embryonic mesodermal lineages and to germ cells. By day 7.25 of embryonic development, a cluster of PGC is visible at the basis of allantois. Subsequently PGC migrate through the embryo proper and colonize genital ridges, where they finally differentiate into sperm and oocytes. We hypothesize that during early development epiblast/germ line-derived cells including PGC become a founder populations of pluripotent stem cells (PSC). These cells are deposited during embryogenesis in various organs and may persist in these locations into adulthood &amp;#150; for example in bone marrow (BM). To support this, we recently identified in BM a population of very small embryonic-like (VSEL) stem cells that express epiblast/germ line-derived cells transcription factor Oct-4 and several other PGC markers. Similarly, cells expressing Oct-4 were also identified in several adult tissues by other investigators. Thus, pluripotent epiblast/PGC may persist beyond embryogenesis in neonatal and adult tissues. Their fate is defined by several mechanisms which regulate cell proliferation and affect status of somatic imprint on selected genes responsible for pluripotency. We hypothesize that these cells play an important role in tissue/organ regeneration and their presence in adult tissues may explain phenomenon of stem cell plasticity. In pathological situations, however they may undergo malignant transformation and give rise to tumors. Correspondence should be addressed to M.Z. Ratajczak, Email: mzrata01@louisville.edu",

The three most used stem cell sources are umbilical cord blood, bone marrow and human embryos. Whilst, cord blood is now used to treat over 70 disorders, at the time of writing this manuscript, not a single disease has been overcome or ameliorated using human embryonic stem cells. Advancing stem cell medicine requires ethically sound and scientifically robust models to develop tomorrow's medicines. Media attention, however, distracts from this reality; it is important to remember that stem cells are a new visitor to the medical world and require more research.

    "abstract": "Nicotinamide is an important cofactor in many metabolic pathways and a known neuroprotective substance, while its methylated product, 1-methylnicotinamide, is a suspected neurotoxin. Homocysteine is a risk factor in Alzheimer’s disease and neurodegeneration, causing inhibition of methylation processes and inducing excitotoxicity. In this study, using primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule cells and propidium iodide staining, we investigated the neurotoxicity of nicotinamide and 1-methylnicotinamide, and their neuroprotective potential in acute and sub-acute homocysteine neurotoxicity. Our results demonstrated that nicotinamide and 1-methylnicotinamide applied for 24 h to cultures at concentrations of up to 25 mM had no effect on neuronal viability. Moreover, nicotinamide at concentrations of 5–20 mM and 1-methylnicotinamide at 1–10 mM applied to cells 24 h before, and for 24 h after an acute 30 min application of 25 mM D,L homocysteine, reduced neuronal damage. 1-Methylnicotinamide at concentrations of 250 and 500 µM showed neuroprotective activity during a sub-acute 24-h exposure to 2.5 mM D,L-homocysteine, while 5 and 25 mM nicotinamide also evoked neuroprotection. These findings do not support suggestions that 1-methylnicotinamide may act as an endogenous neurotoxic agent; rather, they indicate the neuroprotective ability of nicotinamide and 1-methylnicotinamide in homocysteine neurotoxicity. The exact mechanisms of this neuroprotection are unclear and require further investigation.",

An impairment of temporal-order perception can be simulated by time reversing segments of the speech signal. In our study, we investigated how different lengths of time-reversed segments in speech influenced comprehension in ten native German speakers and ten participants who had acquired German as a second language. Results show that native speakers were still able to understand the distorted speech at segment lengths of 50 ms, whereas non-native speakers only could identify sentences with reversed intervals of 32 ms duration. These differences in performance can be interpreted by different levels of semantic and lexical proficiency. Our method of temporally-distorted speech offers a new approach to assess language skills that indirectly taps into lexical and semantic competence of non-native speakers.",

We used myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) 35-55 in complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) to elicit experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice model. As determined by HPLC, striatal dopamine (DA) and serotonin levels in mice treated with either MOG 35-55 in CFA or CFA alone were significantly higher compared to vehicle-treated controls on 13th day after induction. The ratio of homovanilic acid/dopamine (HVA/DA) and 3, 4 dihydroxyphenylacetic acid/dopamine (DOPAC/DA) were significantly lower in the MOG and CFA groups on 13th day, indicating decreased DA metabolism. Noradrenaline (NA) concentration did not differ between groups. Moreover, the striatal mRNA IL-1β and TNF-α levels were elevated during induction phase of EAE in both groups, as determined by RT-PCR.

Nine patients with unilateral amygdalohippocampectomy and 14 controls completed a forced-choice emotional recognition task, in which morphed facial emotional expressions were shown at different emotional intensities, and a self-report questionnaire of interpersonal behavior. Face perception and depressive symptoms were also taken into account. Compared to normal controls, patients were less sensitive in the recognition of fearful and disgusted facial expressions, in line with previous reports. These impairments were only minimally correlated with self-report interpersonal behavior. In all, unilateral damage to the amygdala and medial temporal lobe results in subtle emotion recognition impairments, but these deficits do not appear to extend to self-reported impairments in everyday interpersonal behavior. Further studies need to explore in more detail the effects of these subtle recognition problems on daily social intercourse.",

Twelve participants viewed a series of affective pictures inducing positive, negative or neutral affects. Between the picture blocks, participants performed either incompatible or compatible trials. Behavioral and fMRI data revealed an impact of negative emotions only on the processing of ncompatible trials. Subjects made more errors and showed less activation of brain areas associated with task performance. There was no effect of positive emotions neither on compatible nor incompatible trials.

    "abstract": "Recently, it was found that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) may serve as an important transmitter in peripheral organs as well as in the brain. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible function of H2S in the brain regulation of the circulatory system. Experiments were performed on conscious, male, Wistar-Kyoto rats. Mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded continuously under baseline conditions and during infusions into the lateral cerebral ventricle (LCV) of the experimental animals. In control series LCV infusion of vehicle (Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate-buffer) did not cause significant changes in MABP or HR. LCV infusion of H2S donor (NaHS) at the rate of 400 nM/h resulted in an increase in MABP, whereas infusions at the rate of 100 nM/h and 200 nM/h failed to change MABP. On the other hand LCV infusion of H2S donor at the rate of 200 nM/h caused a significant increase in HR while infusion at the rate of 400 nM/h produced an increase in HR, which was smaller than this observed during infusion at the rate of 200 nM/h. H2S donor administered at the rate of 100 nM/h failed to affect HR. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that exogenous hydrogen sulfide changes hemodynamic parameters by centrally mediated mechanisms. The hemodynamic effect seems to be dependent on H2S concentration in cerebrospinal fluid. It appears that the hypertensive response may occur at a concentration, which does not exceed twice the physiological level.",

Although existing studies suggest an age-related decline in mental abilities, the data on the deterioration of temporal order perception seems inconsistent. Moreover, any evidence on subjects aged over 70 years is lacking. The present experiment aimed to extend the existing data to extremely old people. Temporal order judgment (TOJ) for auditory stimuli was tested across the life span of approx. 80 years, i.e. in young (mean age 22 years) elderly (66 years) and very old (101 years) subjects. Age-related deterioration of performance was observed, with slight changes in elderly subjects and significant deterioration in centenarians which was more distinct in women than in men. The results confirm age-related decrease in temporal resolution which may be explained by slowing of information processing or of a hypothetical internal-timing mechanism. These effects may be influenced by different strategies used in particular age groups.",

In tottering mice, Calbindin D-28k negative gaps were apparent in the vermis but not in the hemisphere. Calbindin D-28k immunofluorescence with DAPI staining demonstrated the absence of Purkinje cells in the Calbindin D-28k negative gaps. The Purkinje cell loss seemed to be observed prominently in the zebrin II negative compartments of the anterior vermis, but in the zebrin II positive compartments of the posterior vermis. Quite consistent with the histopathological observations, quantitation of the density of Calbindin D-28k and zebrin II immunopositive Purkinje cells in the tottering cerebellum revealed that the Purkinje cells were selectively lost in the zebrin II immunonegative compartments of the lobules I and II but in the zebrin II immunopositive compartments in the lobule IX. Those results predict that the susceptibility to the Cav2.1 gene defect is different among Purkinje cell phenotypes of the tottering cerebellum rather than the expression pattern of mutated Cav2.1 channels. This may result in the reproducible parasagittal pattern of Purkinje cell loss.",

In total there were 27 children in the study. The experimental room was divided into three zones equipped with experimental objects providing visual stimulation of varying levels of complexity.

Replicating earlier results, we found an N400 on semantically incongruent words, as well as on low cloze probability words. For the bilinguals investigated in the present study, N400 latency in the low cloze probability condition was found to be modulated by L2 proficiency, indicating that L2 proficiency in our sample might have influenced the speed of semantic integration. Relative Theta power increased for all three word conditions, but no influence of proficiency was observed. Different from the ERP results, we found a stronger increase in theta power for low cloze probability words than for incongruent and high cloze probability words, especially over temporo-parietal brain areas. The spatial distribution of the theta ERD/S results also differed from the N400 topography. Whereas the N400 showed a typical topography with a maximum over temporo-posterior electrode positions, the theta ERD/S topography was maximal for high and low cloze probability words over left central-posterior electrode positions. These findings show that the ERP and ERD/S results are sensitive to semantic processing. The different pattern of the ERD/S results compared to the ERP results, functionally and with regard to topography, suggests that the ERD/S reflects a different aspect or stage of semantic processing, possibly the successful conceptualization of a sentence.",

    "abstract": "Previous imaging studies have identified many brain regions activated during reasoning, but there are differences among the findings concerning specific regions engaged in reasoning and the contribution of language areas. Also, little is known about the relation between task complexity and neural activation during reasoning. The present fMRI study investigated brain activity during complex four-term transitive reasoning with abstract material (determinate or partially indeterminate) and compared the resulting images to those obtained during a memorization task. The memory condition required subjects to memorize unrelated elements whereas the reasoning conditions required them to integrate information from premises and to infer relations between elements. After contrasting the two kinds of reasoning conditions with the memory condition we found that right prefrontal and bilateral parietal regions are specifically activated during reasoning. We also demonstrated that different reasoning requirements - the possibility of constructing one (determined reasoning) versus several (undetermined reasoning) models of a situation during task solving - lead to different patterns of brain activity, with higher prefrontal (PFC) activity accompanying undetermined reasoning. We interpret the PFC activity as a reflection of simultaneous maintenance and manipulation of information in reasoning. These findings provide new evidence that specific forms of reasoning (abstract and undetermined) demand recruitment of right PFC and hemispheric coordination and lend new support to the mental model theory of relational reasoning.",

Such relationships are based on the assumption that there is a close association between fear-evoked behavioral reactions and the responses to painful, aversive stimuli. However, this problem has not been systematically studied. To this end, we investigated the relationship between pain sensitivity in two pain tests (the 'tail-flick' and 'flinch-jump' tests) and a conditioned, fear-evoked, freezing response in rats. The results show that there was no correlation between: (1) the conditioned (associative) and the novelty-evoked (non-specific stress-related) fear response and (2) individual differences in pain threshold and fear responses. Furthermore, factor analysis did not group freezing in the conditioned fear test, individual footshock sensibility, or 'tail-flick' reaction to painful stimuli together. These results indicate that pain sensitivity and conditioned emotional responses to pain are not directly correlated.",

Recent studies suggest that catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), G1947A and monoamine oxidase B (MAOB), A644G polymorphisms might influence the risk and treatment of PD. Herein, we aimed to test the possible influence of MAOB and COMT genetic polymorphisms on the effective daily dose of levodopa administered in the fifth year of treatment. We also examined the effect of COMT and MAOB haplotypes on levodopa therapy outcome. There were 31 females and 72 males of Iranian origin diagnosed with sporadic PD included into the study. The patients were divided into two groups. Group 1: patients received daily doses of levodopa below 500 mg in the fifth year of treatment. Group 2: those patients receiving daily doses exceeding 500 mg in the fifth year of treatment. MAOB and COMT polymorphism genotyping was performed by using PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses. Our data show that the first group suffered less frequently from dyskinesia than patients from the second group. No statistically significant differences were found in allele frequencies and genotype distributions of the studied genes between two groups. In addition, the incidence of the specific haplotypes between the two groups did not show any difference. The present data suggest that pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic factors other than the investigated genetic variants of the MAOB and COMT enzymes seem to determine the response to levodopa in the Iranian PD patients.",

This study investigates how stress induced by strong physical exercise effects blood glutamate, 2-ketoglutarate, Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) levels. The relationship between muscle damage caused by strong physical exercise and blood glutamate levels was also examined. Twenty-two healthy volunteers engaged in intense veloergometry (“spinning”) for a duration of 60 minutes. Two 10 minute peaks of extremely intense exercise were performed at 10 minutes and 50 minutes after the start of exercise. After 60 minutes of exercise, volunteers were monitored for an additional 180 minutes in resting conditions. Blood samples for determination of glutamate and 2-ketoglutarate levels were collected prior to exercise and then every 30 min for entire experiment. Blood samples were also taken at those time points to measure glutamate, 2-ketoglutarate, AST, ALT, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), myoglobin, lactate and venous blood gas levels. Blood glutamate levels were significantly elevated throughout the exercise session (P less than 0.001) and then returned to baseline levels at the cessation of exercise. 2-ketoglutarate, a product of glutamate metabolism, reached significantly elevated levels at 30 minutes (P less than 0.01) from the start of exercise and remained elevated up to 240 minutes post exercise initiation (P less than 0.001). AST and ALT levels were elevated at 60 minutes when compared to baseline. AST levels remained elevated at 240 minutes, unlike ALT levels which returned to baseline values at 240 minutes. Strong physical exercise leads to a significant elevation in blood glutamate, most likely as a result of skeletal muscle damage. 2-ketoglutarate was also found to be elevated for long periods of time, reflecting an ongoing process of glutamate breakdown. Elevated concentrations of AST and ALT in plasma reflect the importance of these enzymes in the maintenance of stable blood glutamate concentrations.",

Strong evidence suggests that this receptor is related to inflammatory and neurodegenerative changes in many pathological states of central nervous system (CNS), including multiple sclerosis (MS). Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is the commonly used animal model of MS. In this study we investigate the expression of P2X(7)R protein in rat brain in the symptomatic phase of EAE (day 10 post immunization) and after reversion of neurological symptoms (day 20 p.i.). We found the increased level of P2X(7)R protein in brain homogenates of EAE rats in both examined time windows. Immunohistochemical study revealed enhanced receptor’s immunoreactivity. Immunoblots done with isolated cellular brain fractions indicated that the P2X7R overexpression is related to synaptosomal fraction in the symptomatic phase and to the glial (GPV) fraction in the recovery phase of EAE. Concomitantly, we noticed overexpression of astroglial marker GFAP in brain homogenates and astroglial fraction (GPV), so as its enhanced immunoreactivity in brain sections (10 days p.i.) which did not decline to control values in the recovery phase, similarly to P2X(7)R expression. Results suggest the involvement of P2X(7)R-mediated signaling in the pathomechanisms of EAE with the possible relevance of astrocytic pool of cells.",

The accuracy of the modified method was evaluated using the temporal and spatial intracranial distribution of dye by intracisternal injection of 6- microliter methylene blue aqueous solution. A high concentration of dye was found in the CM cistern, the ventral cisterns, and intracranial proximal portion of the main cranial nerves at 1 hour after injection. The color of the dye in the CM cistern and the ventral cisterns was lighter, and the dye had reached the intracranial distal portion of the main cranial nerves at 6 hours after injection. The dye was completely eliminated by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation at 24 hours after injection. No severe brain injury was found in any of the 20 mice. Intracisternal injection was successful in all 14 mice sacrificed 1 hour or 6 hours after injection according to the confirmation of dye distribution. The effects of central administration of endothelin-1 (ET1) were evaluated on cerebral blood supply, constriction of cerebral arteries, and change of respiration in mice. Three doses of ET1 were studied: 2 micrograms (0.8 nmol), 4 micrograms (1.6 nmol), and 6 micrograms (2.4 nmol). Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was monitored for 60 minutes following injection using a laser Doppler probe. Intracisternal ET1 injection induced dose-dependent reduction of CBF, constriction of cerebral arteries, and respiratory depression in mice. This modified method of injection into the CM cistern under direct visualization provides accurate and reproducible injection into the CSF, and can be used to investigate the effects of various chemical substances on the central nervous system in mice.",

Animal experiments have shown that BMSC transplantation significantly enhance the recovery of motor and/or cognitive function in various types of neurological disorders such as ischemic stroke. The transplanted BMSCs aggressively migrate toward the damaged tissue and proliferate in the host brain. The BMSCs significantly improve the neuronal receptor function and local glucose metabolism in the peri-infarct area when transplanted into the infarct brain. Recent studies strongly suggest that the BMSCs contain heterogeneous subpopulations and contribute to functional recovery through multiple mechanisms, including neuroprotection, inflammatory modulation, cell fusion, and neural differentiation.

EAE is characterized by infiltration of the CNS by lymphocytes and mononuclear cells, microglial and astrocytic hypertrophy, and demyelination which cumulatively contribute to clinical expression of the disease. EAE was induced in female Sprague-Dawley rats, 3 months old (300 g +/- 20 g), by immunization with myelin basic protein (MBP) in combination with Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). The animals were divided into 7 groups: control, EAE, CFA, EAE + aminoguanidine (AG), AG, EAE + N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and NAC. The animals were sacrificed 15 days after EAE induction, and the level of nitric oxide (NO) production was determined by measuring nitrite and nitrate concentrations in 10% homogenate of cerebellum and spinal cord. Obtained results showed that the level of NO was significantly increased in all examined tissues of the EAE rats compared to the control and CFA groups. Also, AG and NAC treatment decreased the level of NO. in all tissues compared to the EAE group. The level of NO is increased significantly in the spinal cord compared to the cerebellum. The clinical course of the EAE was significantly decreased in the EAE groups treated with AG and NAC during the development of the disease compared to EAE group and its correlates with the NO level in cerebellum and spinal cord. The findings of our work suggest that NO and its derivatives play an important role in multiple sclerosis (MS). It may be the best target for new therapies in human demyelinating disease and recommend the new therapeutic approaches based on a decreased level of NO during the course of MS.",

The aim of the present work was to investigate the effect of OGD on stem/progenitor cells proliferation and/or differentiation in the hippocampus. Our attention was primarily focused on the relationship between neurogenesis-associated processes and activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Cell proliferation was detected by using BrdU incorporation. Newly generated BrdU (+) cells were identified by labeling with specific cell markers. In order to check the activity and localization of MMPs we conducted in situ zymography in conjunction with immunohistochemistry. In our experimental conditions OGD-insult followed by 24 h of recovery caused the damage of neuronal cells in CA1. At 1 week cell death appears all over the hippocampus. We found that expected stimulation of endogenous neurogenesis fails as a source of compensation for the lost neurons in OGD-treated cultures. The modulation of culture microenvironment after ischemia favors the dominant proliferation of glial cells expressed by the enhancement of newly-generated oligodendrocyte progenitors. In addition, during our study we also detected some BrdU labeled nuclei encapsulated by GFAP positive processes. However, the majority of BrdU positive cells expressed microglial specific stain, particularly pronounced in CA1area. The OGD-promoted responses involved activation of metalloproteinases, which matches the progression of gliogenesis. On the other hand, the high activity of MMPs associated with microglial cells implicate their involvement in the mechanism participating in OGD-induced cell damage.",

Previous studies showed neuroprotection after TBI by (endo)cannabinoid mechanisms, suggesting involvement of cannabinoid receptors (CBR). We therefore determined CBR densities and expression of the translocator protein 18 kDA (TSPO) in newborn piglets after experimental TBI. Newborn female piglets were subjected to sham operation (n=6) or fluid-percussion (FP) injury (n=7) under controlled physiological conditions. After six hours, brains were frozen, sagittally cut and incubated with radioligands for CBR ([3HCP-55,940, [3H]SR141716A) and TSPO ([3H]PK11195), an indicator of gliosis/brain injury. Early after injury, FP-TBI elicited a significant ICP increase at a temporary reduced cerebral perfusion pressure; however, CBF and CMRO2 remained within physiological range. At 6 hours post injury, we found a statistically significant increase in binding of the non-selective agonist [3H]CP-55,940 in 15 of the 24 investigated brain regions of injured animals. By contrast, no significant changes in binding of the CB1R-selective antagonist [3H]SR141716A were observed. A non-significant trend towards increased binding of [3H]PK11195 was observed, suggesting an incipient microglial activation. We therefore conclude that in this model and time span after injury, the increase in [3H]CP-55,940 binding reflects changes in CB2R density, while CB1R density is not affected. The results may provide explanation for the neuroprotective properties of cannabinoid ligands and future therapeutic strategies of TBI.",

Additionally, one haplotype block made from eleven BDNF variants (rs2883187, rs1401635, rs2049046, rs2030324, rs11030101, rs10835210, rs1013402, rs1401635, rs1013402), as significant linkage disequilibrium appeared. We discovered possible relationships of CACCGCGTACG and CACCGCGTACG haplotypes with TMT_A and TMT_B performance respectively. Our results confirmed the involvement of BDNF in the regulation of psychomotor speed, working memory and executive function in healthy subjects measured by a task engaging visuoperceptual abilities.",

    "abstract": "\"In recent years, EEG-neurofeedback training (EEG-NFB) has been increasingly used to optimize various brain functions. Better performance in various activities was also reported after relaxation trainings, another popular method in therapeutic practice. Both these methods are used as a part of professional coaching in sports training centers. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of such holistic training on physiological (EEG) and behavioral measures on semi-professional athletes. EEG-NFB paradigm was intended for amplification of the amplitudes of SMR (12–15 Hz) and beta1 (13–20 Hz) bands and simultaneous reduction of the amplitude of theta (4–7.5 Hz) and beta2 (20–30 Hz). Participation in NFB sessions was accompanied with self-administration of relaxing, audio-visual stimulation after each daily athletic training session. The training program resulted in the increase of alpha and beta1 power of trained participants when assessed in rest with eyes-closed. In eyes – open state, participants of the trained group maintained the same level in all frequency bands, in opposite to the control subjects, whose power decreased in the second measurement in beta1 band when compared to the first one. The trained group exhibited greater reduction of reaction times in a test of visual attention than the control group and showed improvement in several performance measures of Kraepelin's work-curve, used to evaluate speed, effectiveness and work accuracy. Together, these results present initial support for the use of holistic, neurophysiological training in sports workout.\"",

Whether event-related high-frequency band responses are related to plasticity in neural recruitment contributed to the stability of sensory/cognitive mechanisms accompanying aging or are underlined pathological changes seen in aging brain remains unknown. Aged effect on brain electrical activity was studied in auditory discrimination task (low-frequency and high-frequency tone) at particular cortical locations in beta (β1: 12.5-20; β2: 20.5-30 Hz) and gamma frequency bands (γ1: 30.5-49; γ2: 52-69 Hz) during sensory (post-stimulus interval 0-250 ms) and cognitive processing (250-600 ms). Beta1 activity less affected by age during sensory processing. Reduced beta1 activity was more widespread during cognitive processing. This difference increased in fronto-parietal direction more expressed after high-frequency tone stimulation. Beta2 and gamma activity were more pronounced with progressive age during sensory processing. Reducing regional-process specificity with progressing age characterized age-related and tone-dependent beta2 changes during sensory, but not during cognitive processing. Beta2 and gamma activity diminished with age on cognitive processes, except the higher frontal tone-dependent gamma activity during cognitive processing. With increasing age, larger gamma2 activity was more expressed over the frontal brain areas to high tone discrimination and hand reaction choice. These gamma2 differences were shifted from posterior to anterior brain regions with advancing age. The aged influence was higher on cognitive processes than on perceptual ones.",

    "abstract": "In the past decade, neural processing has been extensively studied in cognitive neuroscience. However, neural signaling in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) that might clarify reward process remained to be investigated. Male Swiss albino ICR mice implanted with intracranial electrodes into the NAc and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) were used for morphine administration and local field potential (LFP) recording. One-way ANOVA revealed significant increases in low (30.3-44.9 Hz) and high (60.5-95.7 Hz) gamma powers in the NAc following morphine administration (5 and 15 mg/kg, i.p.). These gamma activities oscillated independently with different time-course responses. Locomotor activity was also significantly increased by morphine administration. Regression analyses revealed that high gamma activity induced by morphine was positively correlated with distance travelled by animals. Low and high gamma powers were completely abolished by injection of naloxone, a non-specific opiate antagonist. Analysis of phase-amplitude coupling confirmed that slow oscillations at 1-4 Hz (delta) and 4-8 Hz (theta) for phase were found to significantly increase modulation index of broad (30.27-80.77 Hz) and narrow (59.48-70.34 Hz) frequency ranges for amplitude, respectively. Moreover, significant increases in coherence values between the NAc and the VTA during 30-40 min following morphine administration were seen for 22.46-44.90 Hz frequency range. Altogether, this study demonstrated changes of LFP oscillations in the NAc with low and high gamma activities, delta- and theta-gamma couplings and interplay with VTA in response to morphine administration. These findings represent neural signaling in the mesolimbic dopamine pathway that might process reward function.",

Hypothyroidism was induced in immature Wistar rats by administration of propylthiouracil in drinking water. Rats were divided into four groups: control, hypothyroid, and hypothyroid treated with Rosi at doses of 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg. Memory was then assessed by the Morris water maze (MWM) and passive avoidance (PA) tests. Following anesthetization, brain samples were collected for biochemical measurements. Hypothyroidism increased the escape latency and traveled path in the learning trials of the MWM and decreased the time spent and the distance traveled in the target quadrant on the probe day. Hypothyroidism also impaired the avoidance behavior of rats in the PA test. Rosi improved the performance of rats in both MWM and PA tasks. Hypothyroidism also decreased hippocampal BDNF levels, increased NO metabolites, and induced oxidative damage in the brain. Treatment of hypothyroid rats with both doses of Rosi increased BDNF levels and decreased NO metabolites and malondialdehyde concentrations. In addition, thiol content and superoxide dismutase and catalase activities were increased in the brain regions of hypothyroid rats receiving Rosi. The administration of 4 mg/kg Rosi also significantly increased serum thyroxin levels. The results of the present study showed that BDNF and NO play a role in the protective effects of Rosi against learning and memory impairment in hypothyroid rats.",

    "abstract": "Reactive gliosis and inflammation are risk factors for white matter injury (WMI) development, which are correlated with the development of many neurodevelopmental deficits with no treatment. This study aimed to understand the mechanisms correlated with WMI, with a particular focus on the role of nuclear factor‑kappa B (NF‑kB) and p38 mitogen‑activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathways. Seven‑day‑old Wistar rats were used to generate cerebellar tissue slices. Slices were cultured and randomly allocated to one of 3 groups and treated as follows: group‑I (control); group‑II (WMI), slices were subjected to 20 min of oxygen‑glucose deprivation (OGD); group‑III (WMI+ blockers), slices were subjected to OGD and treated with the blockers. Results showed that OGD insult triggered a marked increase in the apoptosis among WM elements, as confirmed by TUNEL assay. Immunocytochemical experiments revealed that there was a significant decrease in the percent of MBP+ OLs and NG2+ OPCs, and myelin integrity. There was also a significant increase in the percent of reactive microglia and astrocytes. BrdU immunostaining revealed there was an increase in the percent of proliferating microglia and astrocytes. Q‑RT‑PCR results showed OGD upregulated the expression levels of cytokines (TNF‑α, IL‑1, IL‑6, and IL‑1β) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). On the other hand, treatment with BAY11 or SB203580 significantly enhanced the OL survival, restored myelin loss, and reduced microglia and astrocyte reactivity, and downregulated the iNOS and cytokine expression. Our findings demonstrate that blocking of NF‑KB/p38 MAPK pathways alleviated reactive gliosis, inflammation, and OL loss upon WMI. The findings may help to develop therapeutic interventions for WMI.",

The most important damage mechanisms in its formation are oxidative stress and inflammation. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of cannabidiol (CBD) against neuroinflammation through various mechanisms. Thirty‑two female rats were randomly divided into 4 groups as control, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), LPS + CBD and CBD groups. After six hours following LPS administration, rats were sacrificed, brain and cerebellum tissues were obtained. Tissues were stained with hematoxylin‑eosin for histopathological analysis. Apelin and tyrosine hydroxylase synthesis were determined immunohistochemically. Total oxidant status and total antioxidant status levels were measured, and an oxidative stress index was calculated. Protein kinase B (AKT), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cyclic‑AMP response element‑binding protein (CREB) and nuclear factor erythroid 2‑related factor 2 (NRF2) mRNA expression levels were also determined. In the LPS group, hyperemia, degeneration, loss of neurons and gliosis were seen in all three tissues. Additionally, Purkinje cell loss in the cerebellum, as well as neuronal loss in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, were found throughout the LPS group. The expressions of AKT, BDNF, CREB and NRF2, apelin and tyrosine hydroxylase synthesis all decreased significantly. CBD treatment reversed these changes and ameliorated oxidative stress parameters. CBD showed protective effects against neuroinflammation via regulating AKT, CREB, BDNF expressions, NRF2 signaling, apelin and tyrosine hydroxylase synthesis.",

Moreover, we assessed the association between the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and the level of BDNF protein in the serum of patients with PD and controls. The study involved 163 patients with idiopathic PD divided into early onset (<55 years) and late‑onset (>55 years) groups and 91 healthy age‑matched people (Control). The SNP were determined using the TaqMan Real‑Time PCR method. Serum BDNF levels were determined by ELISA assay. The risk of developing early PD in people with the BDNF genotype AG increases threefold in comparison with the carriers of the BDNF genotype GG. In PD patients and healthy people with the BDNF genotypes AG and AA, a lower serum BDNF level was found compared to those with the BDNF genotype GG in both groups. The results of our study indicate that the presence of the Val66Met BDNF gene polymorphism is associated with reduced blood BDNF levels and an elevated risk of developing early‑onset PD. This effect appears to be more pronounced in men.",

During the first 50 flights the mean time taken to collect one portion of food decreased significantly and the number of visits to the artificial flower per flight increased significantly. During flights following the 50th flight, the mean time taken to collect one portion of food increased significantly and the number of visits to the artificial flower per flight decreased significantly.

The pathway of prions to the brain has been elucidated in outline. A striking feature of prions is their extraordinary resistance to conventional sterilisation procedures, and their capacity to bind to surfaces of metal and plastic without losing infectivity.

LTP is an enhancement of synaptic strength induced by a specific pattern of high frequency stimulation, or by application of exogenous ATP. In the hippocampus LTP-inducing stimulation is accompanied by a massive, Ca(2+)-dependent release of ATP from presynaptic terminals. Released extracellular ATP may either interact with numerous types of ATP receptors present on the neuronal surface, or serve as a substrate for ecto-protein phosphorylation. The results of combined electrophysiological and biochemical experiments indicate that participation of extracellular ATP in the ecto-protein phosphorylation process is most likely involved in the permanent amplification of the synaptic response in the hippocampus.",

In order to define the projections of the particular areas, injections of fluorescent tracers were made in three monkeys. Distribution of labeling indicates that area AA1 differs from areas AA2 and AA3 in patterns of both thalamo-cortical and amygdalo-cortical connections. Area AA1 receives its predominant inputs from the ventral and dorsal nuclei of the medical geniculate body (MGB). The amygdaloid projection to the area AA1 originates from the basal nuclei, whereas input from the lateral nucleus was not found. The characteristic thalamic projections to areas AA2 and AA3 originate from the dorsal MGB nucleus and the polymodal nuclei of the posterior thalamus. The density of projections from the dorsal nucleus gradually decreases from area AA1 to area AA3 while projections from the Plm, Sg and Lim nuclei increase in the same direction. Areas AA2 and AA3 are the source of strong connections with the lateral nucleus of amygdala, which density increases progressively when injections shift from area AA2 to AA3. The basal and accessory basal nuclei are the source of a less significant amygdalofugal projections to both cortical areas. Thus, our experimental data indicate that influence of the polymodal thalamic nuclei increases substantially in the direction of the higher order association areas. The strong relation of the same cortical areas with the lateral amygdaloid nucleus might suggest that areas AA2 and AA3, in addition to auditory input are the site of transfer of complex sensory information to the amygdala.",

This process is partially mediated by genetic remodeling, via hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), which induces long-term adaptation processes and is responsible for the increase of levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), erythropoietin (Epo), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and nitric oxide (NO). The synthesis of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) participates in the control of neural plasticity after hypoxia. The mechanisms of neuroprotection against hypoxia may be related to vascular adjustments and to central neurogenic neuroprotection. Some of the factors known to be involved in the development of the mechanism of neuroprotection are also present in the responses to repetitive apneas that occur during sleep in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome, who are frequently exposed to severe sleep hypoxemia. It appears that OSA syndrome represents a clinical example of preconditioning and the development of adaptive responses to intermittent hypoxia.",

This implication has led to the notion that antioxidant defence mechanisms in the brain are not sufficient to prevent oxidative damage, and that dietary intake of a variety of antioxidants might be beneficial for preserving brain function. The present study, therefore, aimed to investigate the protective effect of melatonin against radiation-induced impairment in the learning ability of mice. Twenty days oral administration of melatonin (0.1 mg/kg b.w.), followed by an acute exposure to T-radiation (6 Gy), inhibited the radiation-induced decline in learning ability. Biochemical estimation of brain protein carbonyls, malondialdehide (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) in these mice indicated that radiation-induced augmentation of protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation had been significantly ameliorated in melatonin treated, irradiated mice. Radiation-induced deficit of glutathione was also normalized by melatonin administration, as there was no statistical difference from normal at P < 0.001. Results indicate the antioxidative as well as neuroprotective properties ofmelatonin against the radiation. These findings support results showing melatonin as a free radical scavenger.",

    "abstract": "More than a hundred years of extensive studies have led to the development of clinically valid animal models of spinal cord injury (SCI) used to investigate neurophysiological mechanisms, pathology and potential therapies. The cat and rat models of SCI were found particularly useful due to several behavioral responses that correspond to clinical symptoms seen in patients. This review concentrates on recovery of motor behavior in the rat and cat models of thoracic spinal cord injury. At the beginning an outline of the general concept of neural control of locomotion: the existence of a spinal network producing the locomotor activity and the supraspinal and sensory inputs that influence this network is presented. Next, the severity of functional impairment in relation to the extent and precise location of lesions at the thoracic level in cats and rats is described. Finally, the impact of animal studies on the treatment of SCI patients and the possibility that a spinal network producing the locomotor activity also exists in humans is discussed.

It is recommended as suplement of healthy diet but still the knowledge of its beneficial effect on normal cells is not satisfactory. We decided to examine the effect of flavonoid on neurons morphology and their susceptibility to cell death. Fractal analysis of rat neurons revealed that 24 hours long incubation with quercetin diminished neuronal arborisation in cortical neurons. Neurons also appeared to be very sensitive to cell death after flavonoid treatment in concentration dependent manner. Over 50% of cells died after incubation with 15 μg/ml of flavonoid while 1 μg/ ml of quercetin induced cell death only in 5%. Staining with Hoechst 33342 and propidium ioidide revealed the two types of cell death: apoptosis and necrosis. The number of apoptotic cells was comparable with necrotic ones. These results suggest toxic effect of quercetin on neurons what should be taken into consideration in further studies on using quercetin as therapeutic agent.",

Better understanding of the mechanism(s) regulating the activation of the cell lineage from the endogenous progenitor reservoir might be helpful. Therefore an efficient source of donor cells for transplantation in humans is being craved for. In this study we show that the application of extracellular matrix component-laminin promotes oligogliogenesis from neural stem-like cells of human cord blood cells (HUCB-NSC). Although oligodendrocytes constitute a minor subpopulation of spontaneously differentiated HUCB-NSC, the manipulation of active compounds regulating the process of cell commitment results in a several fold increase in their number. Thus cells of the HUCB-NSC line could be considered as a potential source of glial cells, fulfilling the suitable candidate criteria for oligodendrocyte replacement therapy.",

Timing of HUCBC delivery after ischemia or injection of Cyclosporin A at the time of delivery, had no effect on the number of human cells detected in the ischemic brain. Infusion of HUCBC did not reduce infarct volume and did not improve neurologic deficits after MCAo, suggesting that HUCBC failed to migrate/survive in the ischemic brain and did not provide significant neurological benefits.",

Information about the neurobiological correlates of these deficits complement our knowledge about their mutual relationships by showing that multiple neural networks are involved in the emergence of autism's signs and symptoms. Further investigation of various aspects of these cognitive deficits and the relationships between them may significantly improve our understanding of processes involved in the development of autism.",

To elucidate if MMPs participate in neurogenesis-associated processes after ischemic insult, we aimed to establish spatial and temporal relationships between neural stem-cell development and the activity of MMPs in the adult brain hippocampus. Our results show that post ischemic acceleration in the proliferation of progenitors in the dentate gyrus is accompanied by increased activity of MMPs. On the contrary, in the damaged CA1 pyramidal layer the neurogenesis seems to be rather elusive.Simultaneously, the activity of MMPs fell below the control level. In conclusion, our results show that the activation of MMPs may, at least in part, contribute to ischemia-induced neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the adult brain.",

    "abstract": "Cell adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) generates intracellular signals that modulate cell survival, proliferation, migration and differentiation. Because of its heterogeneous nature, ECM has the potential to induce unique responses that are composition-dependent. One approach to study the effect of ECM signals on cell development, independently on signals from other extracellular sources, has been to deprive cells of serum and to analyze the influence of specific ligands. In the current work we determine the potential of different ECM proteins (fibronectin, laminin, collagen) on the proliferation and differentiation of human umbilical cord blood-derived neural stem cells (HUCB-NSCs) cultured in serum-free conditions. The effect of tested ECM components on the above processes might be associated with the particular pattern of their proteolysis. In this context enzymes that are responsible for the modification of ECM proteins are of particular pertinence. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) represent a family of enzymes known to play role in the modification of ECM and by this can change the cell-ECM substrate interaction, required for cell development. In an effort to elucidate the participation of MMPs in the proliferation and differentiation HUCB-NSCs were cultured in the presence or absence of MMPs inhibitors - GM6001 and doxycycline. Our results show that addition of the above inhibitors interfered with both the proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cells toward the neuronal lineage. This effect depends on the adhesive ECM substrate and is most pronounced in the presence of fibronectin and laminin. In conclusion, our results suggest that MMPs modulate interaction between HUCB-NSCs and their environment and therefore might be an important component in neurogenesis-associated processes.",

However, it is not clear to what extent the responsible brain mechanisms are similar to those invoked in cognitive control in a non-emotional context. The aim of this study was to compare the neural circuitry of cognitive and emotional interference resolution in healthy adolescents, employing variants of the counting Stroop task. Cognitive and emotional interference processing engaged predominantly brain regions belonging to the dorsal- and the ventral attentional systems, respectively, and commonly the inferior frontal gyrus, IFG (Broca’s area, left BA 45, but also right BA 45). These results suggest that BA 45 is a bridge of interaction between the dorsal- and the ventral attentional systems implicated in top-down orienting of attention and, respectively, in bottom-up processing of salient stimuli. Reaction time data showed that some participants tend to respond faster, while others respond slower to negative emotional compared to neutral trials. The emotional interference maps revealed that fast responders recruit the right temporo-parietal junction and to a larger extent the right BA 45 and the bilateral cuneus, suggesting that they engage more efficient cognitive control mechanisms to override the attentional bias. No anterior cingulate (ACC) activation was observed in either cognitive, or emotional interference; this supports the view that ACC is not involved specifically in mediating Stroop selection.",

Non-monotonic dependence of the effect (over-reproduction of the spatial extension) on the varied parameters was observed in two experimental series. In the first series, the maximum effect was obtained for the fillers height roughly equal to the delimiters height (visual angle 0.25 degree); in the second series, the maximum effect was obtained for 11–13 equispaced fillers, and more accurately estimated to 15–16 as a result of a functional fit. Both data series were successfully modeled by curves generated by a single two-parametric system of form functions.

PD is well known to be a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disease produced by a selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The main clinical features of PD include tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and postural instability. Most insights into pathogenesis of PD come from investigations performed in experimental models of PD, especially those produced by neurotoxins. The biochemical and cellular alterations that occur after 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treatment are remarkably similar to that observed in idiopathic PD. Furthermore, it is well known that acute treatment with MPTP can cause a severe loss of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter protein levels and dopamine contents in the striatum of mice, as compared to continuous MPTP treatment. Thus these findings may support the validity of acute MPTP treatment model for unraveling in the neurodegenerative processes in PD. In this review, we discuss the neuroprotective effects of various compounds against neuronal cell loss in an MPTP model of PD. This review may lead to a much better understanding of PD as well as provide novel clues to new targets for therapeutic interventions in PD patients.",

There is however an ever-growing list of evidences that NG2 cells actually possess an intrinsic neurogenic potential and they are capable of neuronal differentiation in response to environmental stimuli. To address the question, we have established a model of an indirect co-culture system of the freshly isolated rat neonatal NG2 cells and organotypic slices derived from two distinct CNS regions (hippocampus and spinal cord) to mimic the nervous tissue microenviroment. The cell differentiation in microenvironment of OGD-injured hippocampal slices has been studied as well. The molecular analysis of selected trophic factors has been performed to determine the patterns of their expression. Indeed, the comparison of the cell commitment and development in various microenvironments has pointed to significant dissimilarities. First of all, the medium being continuously conditioned by the hippocampal slices efficiently promoted neurogenesis. The effect has been significantly abolished in co-cultures with the injured tissue. The less pronounced susceptibility to adopting neuronal phenotype and the considerable slowdown of oligodendroglial development was observed in the co-cultures with the spinal cord slices. The role of BDNF in oligodendroglial progenitor commitment and development has been investigated proving that it is one of the key players in the examined processes. The specificity of the instructive clues cocktail might module the fate choice of mobilized endogenous or transplanted cells, which should be taken into consideration while planning neurorepair strategies.",

    "abstract": "Toluene, found in glues and cleaners, is among the inhalants most commonly abused by workers and young drug addicts. In this study, we examined the changes in sleep patterns and monoamine content induced by chronic toluene exposure. Rats were chronically exposed to toluene vapors beginning at 30 days of age for a duration of 30 days. Experiment I was performed in a control group (n=10) and a chronic toluene exposure group (n=10). Rats were implanted with bipolar stainless steel electrodes for electroencephalographic recording (EEG). In experiment II, conducted in two other groups (control and exposed to toluene, n=10 each), animals were sacrificed by decapitation prior to chromatographic analysis. We found that chronic toluene administration affected the organization of sleep patterns and monoamine content. Dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA) increased in the midbrain and striatum. 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) increased only in the striatum. Midbrain levels of serotonin (5-HT) increased in the pons and decreased in the hypothalamus and striatum. 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) increased in the pons, midbrain and striatum and decreased in the hypothalamus. Chronic toluene exposure induced changes in the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems and increased SWS and PS deficits. We conclude that toluene exposure disrupts the sleep-wake cycle by affecting the monoaminergic response in cerebral areas related to sleep.",

    "abstract": "Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a neuropeptide, which is widely distributed in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues, acting both as a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator. Despite its extensive expression in the hippocampus, amygdala and other limbic system structures, the effects of VIP on anxiety and depression have not yet been fully investigated. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the involvement of VIP and VIP receptors in the mechanism of anxiety in rats with a model of depression (bilateral olfactory bulbectomy), using the elevated plus-maze test. VIP and a non-specific antagonist of VIP receptors (VIP6-28) were administered unilaterally into the hippocampal CA1 area of bulbectomized (OBX) rats. VIP (10 ng) showed a tendency for an anxiety-modulatory effect upon right side injection, by reducing significantly the closed arm time and increasing the open arm time. VIP (100 ng) injected unilaterally (left or right) into CA1 area induced an anxiolytic-like effect on the activity of OBX rats (increased the number of open arms entries, open arm time and the ratio open/total number of entries). VIP6-28 failed to antagonize the anxiety-related behavior of OBX rats in the plus maze. An unexpected finding in our study was that upon pretreatment with VIP6-28, VIP (10 ng), injected unilaterally (left or right) exerted an anti-anxiety like effect (increased the number of open arm entries, open arm time and the ratio open/total number of entries). Our data point to a possible involvement of hippocampal VIP-ergic neurons in modulating emotional processes or adaptive responses to stressful stimuli in a rat model of depression",

    "abstract": "Adverse early experience is generally regarded as a risk factor for both externalizing and internalizing behavioral disorders in humans. It can be modeled in rats by a post-weaning social isolation procedure. Effects of social isolation might possibly be ameliorated by environmental enrichment. In the current study, 24 male Wistar rats were divided post-weaning into four rearing conditions: control, environmental enrichment (EE), social isolation (SI) and a combination of the two experimental conditions; (EE+SI). Two observations of the effects of rearing conditions on the rate of social and object interactions were conducted during the juvenile and post-pubertal stages of development. The SI condition led to a marked increase of social interactions during the juvenile phase, but did not affect object interactions. The EE condition increased the level of social interactions during both the juvenile and post-pubertal measurements. The effects of early rearing conditions on adult exploratory behavior were less clear, with a significant difference between the groups obtained in one of three behavioral tests. Results suggest a general robustness in the development of adult exploratory behavior and anxiety when rats were exposed to early social isolation and provided brief opportunities for social play during the juvenile period. Further studies, aimed at distinguishing play-related protective factors serving against long-term adverse effects of juvenile social isolation, are suggested.",

NO donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 50 micrograms per rat, i.c.v.) reduced the frequency but not the amplitude of epileptiform discharges. Non-selective NOS inhibitor, N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 100 micrograms per rat, i.c.v.) practically did not exert any effect on the spike frequency and amplitude. Adenosine (100 micrograms per rat, i.c.) reduced spike frequency but not the amplitude, whereas theophylline (100 micrograms per rat, i.c.v.) increased the mean spike frequency and amplitude of penicillin-induced epileptiform discharges. Co-injection of theophylline and L-NAME did not cause a further increase in the epileptiform activity compared with theophylline. When NO production was blocked with L-NAME, the inhibitory effects of adenosine were lost. The obtained results suggest that NO and adenosine may decrease penicillin-induced epileptiform activity in rats and that NO, at least in part, may mediate the anticonvulsant effect of adenosine.",

Systemic administration of NMDAR antagonists, in addition to provoking an increase in c-Fos expression, leads to important neurochemical and electrophysiological changes within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Since the mPFC is considered to exert a top-down regulatory control of subcortical brain regions, we examined the effects of local infusion of the NMDAR antagonist, MK801, into the mPFC on the expression of c-Fos protein (widely used marker of neuronal activation) in several subcortical structures. The experiment was performed on freely moving rats, bilaterally implanted with guide cannulae in the prelimbic mPFC, infused with MK801 or saline. Bilateral administration of MK801 to the mPFC produced changes in the behavior (increased stereotypy and decreased sleep-like behavior) and complex changes in c-Fos protein expression with significant increases observed in the nucleus accumbens (core and shell), amygdala (basolateral and central nuclei), the CA1 field of the hippocampus, and mediodorsal and paraventricular thalamic nuclei, as compared to the saline group. Together, we demonstrate that blockade of NMDA receptors in the mPFC is sufficient to lead to behavioral abnormalities and increased c-Fos expression in many, but not all, of the subcortical structures examined. Our findings suggest that some of the behavioral abnormalities produced by uncompetitive NMDAR antagonists may result from aberrant activity in cortico-subcortical pathways. These data support an increasing body of literature, suggesting that the mPFC is an important site mediating the effects of NMDAR antagonists.",

Seeds of chia (Salvia hispanica L.) are highly rich in these nutrients, and thus, the present study investigated the effects of chia seeds on behavior and cognition in an aluminum‑induced Alzheimer's disease model in rats. Experimental animals received chia supplementation either during the generation of the model (i.e., pretreatment) or after the model was established (i.e., treatment). A battery of behavioral and cognitive tests were performed, including open‑field, elevated plus maze, Porsolt's forced swim, and Morris' water maze, to evaluate anxiety‑ and depression‑like behaviors, and learning and memory. Results showed that chia supplementation was ineffective against Alzheimer's‑related anxiety, whereas depression‑like behaviors were attenuated with both pretreatment and treatment. There was no improvement in learning and memory with chia treatment. Rather, cognitive performance in chia‑pretreated animals was remarkably worse as compared to their non‑treated disease‑induced counterparts. Hippocampal concentrations of amyloid-β42, amyloid precursor protein, and total tau protein were similarly increased in all disease‑induced animals (despite chia supplementation), as compared to the controls. Based on these findings, chia supplementation during the progression of Alzheimer's disease may exacerbate the disease. Although the results presented here emerge from an experimental/preclinical study, we suggest cautious and careful use of chia, especially in early‑stage Alzheimer's patients, until future research in different experimental settings is conducted.",

Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) and fluorine nanoemulsion (19F) are characterized by low toxicity and good sensitivity, and, as such, are among the most frequently used cell-labeling agents. However, to date, their impact across the various populations of MSCs has not been comprehensively investigated. Thus, the impact of MRI tags (independent variable) has been set as a primary endpoint. The various populations of mouse MSCs in which the effect of tag was investigated consisted of (1) tissue of cell origin: bone marrow vs. Adipose tissue; (2) age of donor: young vs. old; (3) cell culture conditions: hypoxic vs. normal vs. normal + ascorbic acid (AA); (4) exposure to acidosis: yes vs. no. The impact of those populations has been also analyzed and considered as secondary endpoints. The experimental readouts (dependent variables) included: (1) cell viability; (2) cell size; (3) cell doubling time; (4) colony formation; (5) efficiency of labeling; and (6) cell migration. We did not identify any impact of cell labeling for these investigated populations in any of the readouts. In addition, we found that the harsh microenvironment of injured tissue modeled by a culture of cells in a highly acidic environment has a profound effect on all readouts, and both age of donor and cell origin tissue also have a substantial influence on most of the readouts, while oxygen tension in the cell culture conditions has a smaller impact on MSCs. A detailed characterization of the factors that influence the quality of MSCs is vital to the proper pursuit of preclinical and clinical studies.",

We also examined the effects of intracortical microinjection of diazepam (a GABA-benzodiazepine receptor agonist) and flumazenil (a GABAbenzodiazepine receptor antagonist) to clarify the possible mechanism of vitamin B12. In urethane-anesthetized rats, epileptiform activity was induced by intracortical microinjection of penicillin (300 IU, 1.5 microL), and the number and amplitude of spike waves were analyzed using electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. Intracortical microinjections of vitamin B12 at doses of 100 and 200 ng/site, diazepam at a dose of 200 ng/site and their ineffective doses (50 ng/site of vitamin B12 with 50 ng/site of diazepam) co-microinjection treatment significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced both the number and amplitude of spike waves. In addition, combined microinjection of effective doses of vitamin B12 (100 ng/site) and diazepam (200 ng/site) produced more antiepileptiform effect in comparison with their alone used doses. The antiepileptic effects induced by microinjection of vitamin B12 and diazepam at a same dose of 200 ng/site were prevented by the same site microinjection of 50 ng/site of flumazenil. The results showed antiepileptiform activities for vitamin B12 and diazepam AT the cerebral cortex level. A central GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex-mediated mechanism might be involved in the antiepileptiform activity of vitamin B12.",

German speaking dyslexic elementary school children (n=30; M=9.8 years) were matched by forming triplets based on IQ, reading quotient and phonological awareness and then randomly assigned to one out of three interventions (n=10): a phonological awareness training, a phonology-based reading training (phonics instruction), and a visually-based reading training (repeated reading of sight words). A total of 20 training sessions (30 minutes each) were distributed over four weeks. Typical readers (n=10; M=9.5 years) were assigned to the control group. Phonological awareness training directly improves reading comprehension in German dyslexic children with a phonological awareness deficit. However, these children can equally benefit from a visually-based reading training. In contrast, the phonology-based reading training has a direct selective effect on decoding but not on reading comprehension. Despite divergent short-term patterns, long-term improvement of reading comprehension and decoding is similar across all training groups, irrespective of the training method. Phonological awareness may but does not need to be part of reading remediation in dyslexic children with a phonological deficit when learning to read a consistent orthography. Rather, a visually-based reading strategy might compensate for the phonological deficit in dyslexic children after the initial stage of reading acquisition.",

    "abstract": "Auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) are widely applied to test brain’s ability to follow external stimulation in neuropsychiatric disorders. It is known that ASSRs are related to GABAergic transmission. Female sex steroid homones – both estrogens and progesterone – affect functioning of GABAergic system. However, it is not known how these hormones affect brain’s ability to entrain. This study was designed to test the ability to synchronize to 40 Hz stimulation during different phases of the menstrual cycle. Twenty-eight healthy females participated in the research during one of the menstrual cycle phases: (1) early follicular; (2) late follicular; (3) and mid-luteal. Auditory 40 Hz trains of 500 ms were delivered binaurally and EEG was recorded. Time-frequency analysis of the data was performed and phase-locking index, evoked amplitude and total intensity measures were extracted and decomposed by non-negative multi-way factorization. Additionally, alpha power of the baseline period was calculated. Parameters of ASSR were increasing in a linear manner with increasing levels of 17Beta-estradiol and largest estimates of ASSR parameters were obtained in the late follicular phase, smallest – in the mid-luteal phase. Alpha power values were highest in the late follicular phase and lowest in the mid-luteal phase, pointing to lower arousal level in the late follicular phase. We speculate that increased 40 Hz ASSRs during mid-cycle might be related to the level of general arousal and specific GABA-mediated changes during the menstrual cycle. The results suggest that the ability to entrain to 40 Hz stimulation depends on the phase of menstrual cycle. This should be taken into account, particularly when ASSRs are used in clinical practice, comparing patients and healthy subjects.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic dysfunction is a well-documented manifestation in animal models of Alzheimer's disease pathology. In this context, numerous studies have documented reduction in the functionality of synapses in various models. In addition, recent research has shed more light on increased excitability and its link to seizures and seizure-like activities in AD patients as well as in mouse models. These reports of hyperexcitability contradict the observed reduction in synaptic function and have been suggested to be as a result of the interplay between inhibitory and excitatory neuronal mechanism. The present study therefore investigates functional deficiency in the inhibitory system as complementary to the identified alterations in the glutamate excitatory pathway in AD. Since synaptic function deficit in AD is typically linked to progression/pathology of the disease, it is important to determine whether the deficits in the GABAergic system are functional and can be directly linked to the pattern of the disruption documented in the glutamate system. To build on previous research in this field, experiments were designed to determine if previously documented synaptic dysfunction in AD models is concomitantly observed with excitation/inhibition imbalance as suggested by observation of seizure and seizure-like pathology in such models. We report changes in synaptic function in aged APPPS1 mice not observable in the younger cohort. These changes in synaptic function are furthermore accompanied by alteration in the GABAergic neurotransmission. Thus, age-dependent alteration in the inhibitory/excitatory balance might underpin the symptomatic changes observed with the progression of Alzheimer's disease pathology including sleep disturbance and epileptic events.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder. Given the pathogenesis of AD is unclear, there is currently no drug approved to halt or delay the progression of AD. Therefore, it is pressing to explore new targets and drugs for AD. In China, polyphenolic Chinese herbal medicine has been used for thousands of years in clinical application, and no toxic effects have been reported. In the present study, using D-galactose and aluminum-induced rat model, the effects of paeonol on AD were validated via the Morris water maze test, open field test, and elevated plus maze test. Neuronal morphology in frontal cortex was assessed using ImageJ's Sholl plugin and RESCONSTRUCT software. RhoA/Rock2/Limk1/cofilin1 signaling pathway-related molecules were determined by Western blotting. Cofilin1 and p-cofilin1 were analyzed by immunofluorescence. Results showed that pre-treatment with paeonol attenuated D-galactose and aluminum-induced behavioral dysfunction and AD-like pathological alterations in the frontal cortex. Accompanied by these changes were the alterations in the dendrite and dendritic spine densities, especially the mushroom-type and filopodia-type spines in the apical dendrites, as well as actin filaments. In addition, the activity and intracellular distribution of cofilin1 and the molecules RhoA/Rock2/Limk1 that regulate the signaling pathway for cofilin1 phosphorylation have also changed. Our data suggests that paeonol may be through reducing Aβ levels to alleviate the loss of fibrillar actin and dendrites and dendritic spines via the Rho/Rock2/Limk1/cofilin1 signaling pathway in the frontal cortex, and ultimately improving AD-like behavior.",

    "abstract": "Physical exercise improves learning and memory abilities by increasing the levels of several growth factors in the hippocampus. One growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is primarily produced in the muscles and not only increases in the periphery during exercise but can also cross the blood-brain barrier. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of regular aerobic chronic exercise on different types of muscle fibers and the relationships between learning/memory and muscle induced-VEGF. Following a one-week adaptation period, male rats underwent treadmill training at a speed of 8 m/min for 30 min daily, 3 days a week for 6 weeks. Memory functions were evaluated using the Morris water maze. VEGF, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured in type 1 and type 2 muscle fibers and VEGF levels were also measured in the hippocampus. Exercise positively affected both learning and memory and also increased VEGF levels in both muscle fiber types. Muscle VEGF levels positively correlate with hippocampal learning and hippocampal VEGF levels. Exercise reduced both SOD and MDA levels in type 1 and type 2 muscle fibers, whereas GPx levels decreased only in type 2 muscle fibers. Our findings suggest that regular aerobic exercise elevates VEGF levels and diminishes oxidative stress in both fiber types. Exercise-induced VEGF levels in both type 1 and 2 muscle fibers appear to be associated with the positive effect of exercise on learning and memory function and is accompanied by an increase in VEGF levels in the hippocampus. Further research is needed to elucidate the exact mechanism by which fiber type-specific VEGF mediates hippocampal neurogenesis and angiogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease with a prevalence estimated to reach 115 million by 2050. It is characterized by abnormal extracellular accumulation of amyloid‑beta (Aβ) peptide and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that result in neuro‑inflammation, synaptic dysfunction, neurotransmitter imbalance, neuronal loss, and dendritic changes. A hypothesis of neurotrophic factor (NTF) involvement in neurodegenerative diseases and their potential as a therapeutic tool has emerged. There are wide information gaps on this topic. However, consistent with this hypothesis, AD may be caused by a deficiency in neurotrophin proteins or receptors expression. In AD brains, an increase in nerve growth factor and a decrease in brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus and certain neocortical regions, and a decrease in TrkA in the cortex and nucleus basalis has been observed. Thus, comparative data relating to recent hypotheses addressing NTF content and receptors in experimental animals and human brains, along with their potential roles in the treat ment of AD, are discussed in this review.",

    "abstract": "The recent pandemic of the coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID‑19) has affected around 192 countries, and projections have shown that around 40% to 70% of world population could be infected in the next months. COVID‑19 is caused by the virus SARS‑ CoV‑2, it enters the cells through the ACE2 receptor (angiotensin converting enzyme 2). It is well known that SARS‑CoV‑2 could develop mild, moderate, and severe respiratory symptoms that could lead to death. The virus receptor is expressed in different organs such as the lungs, kidney, intestine, and brain, among others. In the lung could cause pneumonia and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The brain can be directly affected by cellular damage due to viral invasion, which can lead to an inflammatory response, by the decrease in the enzymatic activity of ACE2 that regulates neuroprotective, neuro‑immunomodulatory and neutralizing functions of oxidative stress. Another severe damage is hypoxemia in patients that do not receive adequate respiratory support. The neurological symptoms that the patient presents, will depend on factors that condition the expression of ACE2 in the brain such as age and sex, as well as the mechanism of neuronal invasion, the immune response and the general state of the patient. Clinical and histopathological studies have described neurological alterations in human patients with COVID‑19. These conditions could have a possible contribution to the morbidity and mortality caused by this disease and may even represent the onset of neurodegenerative activity in recovered patients.",

The six week old animals were first exposed to a 6.9 kHz tone pair of 2 ms pulses of 120 db intensity with the inter-stimulus interval (ISI) between 2 and 11 ms. ASR amplitudes and latencies as a function of the ISI, animal strain and gender were recorded and analyzed for ten consecutive weeks. No differences in the ASR amplitude between Wistar and hooded rats were found. ASR amplitude increased during the experimental period and followed body weight increase. Significant differences were also observed between male and female rats in their startle responses to acoustic stimuli. Generally, male subjects responded with a greater ASR amplitude than females, and the changes may be attributed to the difference in neuromuscular development between genders. This experiment sets a background for further developmental studies.",

Fear behavior was examined in the modified version of light-dark transition test. The time out from the illuminated compartment of chamber, the time spent there and number of returns to the illuminated compartment was measured. Additionally motor activity, i.e., number of crossings and rearings in dark as well as in the illuminated part of compartment, was registered. Blockade of GABAA receptors in the ventromedial hypothalamus resulted in increased fear behavior, i.e. decrease of time out from illuminated compartment and decrease of the time spent there. Motor behavior remained unchanged. HPLC analysis showed reduction of GABA concentration in all investigated brain structures. An increase of NA concentration in all examined structures with exception of the hypothalamus without effect on MHPG/NA was observed as well. Dopamine level remained unchanged, but DOP AC/DA ratio increased in all structures, except frontal cortex. Also HV AIDA ratio increased in the hypothalamus and midbrain. 5-HT concentration increased only in midbrain, 5-HIAA increased in midbrain and in frontal cortex, and 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio increased only in frontal cortex. These results indicate that GABA-ergic and monoaminergic systems remain in functional interactions and that these interactions may play an important role in the neurochemical regulation of fear behavior. The possible mechanism of GABA - monoaminergic interactions is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Chemically provoked seizures have proved to serve as useful model to investigate long term neuronal responses collectively termed as neuronal plasticity. In particular, rapid, transient activation of immediate early gene expression induced by such chemoconvulsants like pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) and kainic acid (KA) drew a great attention. These genes code for transcription factors, known to influence gene expression, and therefore able to orchestrate genomic responses to extracellular stimuli. In our studies reviewed herein and reported in detail elsewhere, we have investigated PTZ- and KA-dependent activation of a functional feature of transcription factors i.e. their DNA-binding activity. We have found that only AP-1 DNA-binding activity was elevated in the rat hippocampus, entorhinal and sensory cortices 2-6 h after the PTZ administration, and only in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex at similar times following KA injection. The AP-1 response to PTZ was strikingly enhanced in aged (18-24 months old) animals when compared to young (3 months old) ones. KA, apart from this early phase of AP-1 DNA-binding activity increase, evoked also the late one (reaching a peak value at 72 h). The protein composition of the latter differed from the former mostly by substitution of Jun B with Jun D protein and lack of c-Fos. Because the KA treatment leads not only to the seizures but to apoptosis (programmed cell death) as well, our results indicate that various AP-1 complexes may be involved in both of these phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "A specific temporal order of events at the cellular and molecular level occurs in response to injury to the brain. Injury-compromised neurons degenerate while surviving neurons undergo neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis to establish neuronal connectivity destroyed in the injury. Several genes, such as those coding cytoskeletal proteins and growth factors, have been shown to be regulated by AP-1 and NF-kappa B transcription factors, two of the most studied DNA binding regulatory proteins. Our laboratory has discovered that Fos-related antigen-2 from AP-1 transcription factor family and NF-kappa B p65 and p50 subunits are induced long-term (days to months) in the brain after neurotoxic, excitotoxic or ischemic insult. Fos-related antigen-2 is induced in neurons in several models of injury and its elevated expression lasts days to months, corresponding to the severity. The time-course of FRA-2 induction is abbreviated with less severe insult (terminal damage) relative to the cell death, but the induction occurs during the period of regeneration and repair in both models. NF-kappa B p65 is basally expressed in hippocampal and cortical neurons, but is elevated in reactive astrocytes in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex starting at two days and lasting at least two weeks after kainate treatment. Neurons of the hippocampus surviving ischemic or neurotoxic injury increase expression of NF-kappa B p50 for at least a week after injury, suggesting a function for p50 in neuronal survival and/or repair. The extended expression of these transcription factors implies a role in the activation of genes related to repair and regeneration, such as growth factors and synaptic proteins, after injury to the CNS.",

    "abstract": "It is well established that neurons in the retinorecipient layers of superior colliculus (SC), the mammalian homologue of the optic tectum of other vertebrates, are extremely sensitive to moving stimuli. In our studies we have distinguished several functionally distinct groups of neurons in the retinorecipient layers of the SC of the cat on the basis of their velocity response profiles. Our data revealed substantial convergence of the Y and non-Y information channels on single SC neurons. Second, using the method of selective conduction block of the Y-type fibers in one optic nerve we have shown that responses of SC cells to high-velocity motion are dependant on the integrity of Y-type input. Third, in order to determine the degree of influence of the X- and W-type input on cellular responses we have examined spatial and temporal frequency response profiles of single collicular neurons using sinusoidal gratings drifting in the preferred direction. At any given eccentricity, most collicular neurons exhibited a preference for relatively very low spatial frequencies. The preference for low spatial frequencies combined with temporal frequency profiles of collicular neurons suggests that the Y- and W-type inputs constitute the major functional inputs to the retinorecipient layers of the SC and that the \"top-down\" X-type input from the visual cortex has only a minor impact on the spatio-temporal frequency response profiles of collicular receptive fields.",

Activity of MMPs was determined by gelatin zymography in homogenates from dorsal (DP, an equivalent of CA1 sector) and abdominal (AbP, containing CA2-4 and gyrus dentatus) parts of hippocampus. A significant activation of both investigated metalloproteinases was found at 72 h of recovery. Whereas MMP-2 up-regulation did not show any spatial preferences, the increase of MMP-9 activity was observed exclusively in DP. Activation of MMP-9 at this time point correlated spatially with degradation of laminin - protein of extracellular matrix. These results show that MMP pathway may function as a component of delayed neuronal death cascade in the apoptogenic CA1 sector after transient global ischemia.",

One of the most influential theories attempting to explain problems suffered by dyslexics assumes that dyslexia is caused by deficits of the magnocellular system. This system, generally responsible for processing fast sensory information, projects mostly to the parietal cortex. Consistent with this theory, dyslexics should have problems with tasks which specifically involve parietal cortex. In the article, we review data and show that, indeed, dyslexics have problems with fast attention shifts, show some symptoms of mild unilateral neglect syndrome and have abnormal saccadic and pursuit eye movements.

Subjects with language impairments not only show deficits in the identification of stop-consonant vowel syllables, but also have problems detecting the temporal order of acoustic stimuli. Recently published studies claim that an improvement in phoneme discrimination can be achieved through the training of temporal-processing abilities. Critical assessment of these studies often reveals the following weaknesses: first, the diagnostic and training methods vary between studies, which makes comparisons difficult. Second, usually only mean differences between groups or before/after treatment are presented. The success in diagnosis and training of individuals or subgroups is not documented. Third, only few diagnostic measures employed have been tested for reliability. Furthermore, the tests have not been designed according to modern psychometric methods. Fourth, several training modules are used in parallel. The effects of temporal-processing training cannot be isolated. Possible approaches for detecting the possible causal relation between the time and the language domain are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The search for a definitive gender bias in Alzheimer's disease has resulted in a multitude of epidemiological findings that point to a higher prevalence and incidence of Alzheimer's disease in women. Due to this reported predisposition of women to Alzheimer's disease, the sex steroid estrogen has become the primary focus of research in this field, however, inconclusive data regarding estrogen replacement therapy has lead some researchers to further investigate the role of the other hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis that have been, for the most, part overlooked. The hormones of the HPG axis, such as the gonadotropin, (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone), are involved in regulating reproductive function via a complex feedback loop. We propose that it is in fact the increase in gonadotropin concentrations and not the decrease in steroid hormone (e.g., estrogen) production following menopause/andropause that results in an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, when the role of gonadotropins is taken into account, the data obtained from recent epidemiological studies and randomized trials suggesting the ineffectiveness estrogen may indeed be misinterpreted. In this review, we examine how hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, in particular the gonadotropins, play a central and determining role in modulating the susceptibility to and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Based on this, we suggest that therapeutic interventions targeted at gonadotropins could both prevent disease in those patients currently asymptomatic or halt, and even reverse, disease in those currently afflicted.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral ischemia was produced by moderate compression for 30 min of a specific brain area in the sensorimotor cortex of Sprague-Dawley rats. On day 1, that is 24 h after the transient sensorimotor compression, ischemia-exposed animals displayed a marked focal neurological deficit documented as impaired beam walking performance. This functional disturbance was mainly due to contralateral fore- and hind-limb paresis. As assessed by daily beam walking tests it was shown that there was a spontaneous recovery of motor functions over a period of five to seven days after the ischemic event. Using histopathological analysis (Nissl staining) we have previously reported that the present experimental paradigm does not produce pannecrosis (tissue cavitation) despite the highly reproducible focal neurological deficit. We now show how staining with fluorescent markers for neuronal death, that is Fluoro-Jade and TUNEL, respectively, identifies regional patterns of selective neuronal death. These observations add further support to the working hypothesis that the brain damage caused by cortical compression-induced ischemia consists of scattered, degenerating neurons in specific brain regions. Postsurgical administration of the AMPA receptor specific antagonist, LY326325 (30 mg/kg; i.p, 70 min after compression), not only improved beam walking performance on day 1 to 3, respectively but also significantly reduced the number of Fluoro-Jade stained neurons on day 5. These results suggest that enhanced AMPA/glutamate receptor activity is at least partially responsible for the ischemia-produced brain damage detected by the fluorescent marker Fluoro-Jade.",

We attributed the two principal components of the first negative wave (N1) of the cortical EP to the activation of two pyramidal cell populations (supra- and infragranular) of the central barrel-column. A positive wave of longer latency (P2) reflected the activation of the neighboring columns of the barrel cortex. The EPs recorded continuously throughout the experiment could be sorted into two classes dominated by the activity of either infra- or supragranular pyramidal cells. The introduction of an aversive contextual stimuli increased the amplitude of the second component of the N1 wave, which is built up by activation of infragranular cells, and the amplitude of the P2 wave representing excitation of neighboring columns. We hypothesize that increased activity of infragranular cells activates a cortico-thalamo-cortical loop going through the POm nucleus, which finally excites wider areas of primary somatosensory cortex. This spread of activity enables the comparison of information from neighboring vibrissae at the mystacial pad. The general cortical activation caused by the introduction of the contextual stimuli might be induced by noradrenergic and/or cholinergic systems. Prolonged contextual stimulation causes habituation processes, which return the cortical network to an idle state.",

For semantics and phonology there seem to be different fronto-temporal networks which are shared in production and comprehension. The results for the processing of syntactic information are not entirely conclusive. Yet the data reveal that phonological strategies may be used in syntactic tasks. This finding opens the discussion of alternative, phonology-based strategies for language processing. Such strategies are accounted for by dual-route models featuring one direct and one indirect route which often involves phonological processing.

Our results indicated that after ischemia AIF is preferentially translocated from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm and to the nucleus. Intravenous administration of 3-AB (30 mg/kg b.w.) prevents AIF translocation to the nucleus. AIF was mainly seen in the structurally unchanged mitochondria and Golgi complex. Moreover, after 3-AB administration overexpression of Bcl-2 protein was observed in mitochondrial membranes, rough endoplasmatic reticulum, Golgi complex, nuclear envelopes, and also in cytoplasm and in nucleus.

There was a significant age-related increase in the BDNF mRNA expression between PND 3060 in MRC animals. The BDNF mRNA expression in ET rats was increased at both PND 16 and 20 and thereafter decreased at PND 60 compared to SC animals. Such age-related fluctuation in the expression of BDNF mRNA differed from that of MRC animals. The exact functional implications, if any, of these ethanol-induced changes in BDNF mRNA expression remain unknown although it can be speculated that they may have an effect on the behaviors known to be influenced by the hippocampal formation.",

    "abstract": "A focal cold lesion-induced injury, i.e., a model of focal vasogenic brain edema, enhances the permeability of the blood-brain barrier and cell membrane in the perilesional rim. However, non-intact cells can be detected, e.g. by markers of apoptosis, only hours or even days after the injury. The early membrane dysfunction allows extravasated serum proteins to enter the injured cells, which can be readily visualized if the plasma albumin was previously bound to fluorescent tracers, such as Evans Blue (EB). The aim of this study was to demonstrate injured cells that take up the EB/albumin conjugate in the perilesional rim. This tracer was administered 3.5 h after the induction of the injury and the animals were sacrificed 30 min later. With an excitation wavelength of 530-550 nm, the EB-positive cells emitted bright-red fluorescence at > 590 nm and were easy to count. No positive cells were observed in the controls. This method provides more information than the classical 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride reaction, because it permits an assessment of the density and distribution of cells with non-intact cell membranes in the perilesional area following cerebrocortical injury.",

    "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a grave condition in which the brain undergoes lasting seizures which can lead to neuronal loss. Our previous study suggested that preconditioning with erythropoietin (Epo) suppressed neuronal apoptosis in hippocampus of rats following SE in vivo by inhibiting caspase-3. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which Epo preconditioning may exert its anti-apoptotic effects using a lithium-pilocarpine induced SE model in rats. The effects of Epo on neuronal cell death were evaluated using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), and the role of the Bcl-2 protein family, which have been shown to be anti- (Bcl-2, Bcl-w) or pro- (Bid, Bim) apoptotic, was examined with immunofluorescence. We found Epo preconditioning decreased the total number of TUNEL, Bim and Bid positive cells, but increased the total number of Bcl-w and Bcl-2 positive cells. These results suggest that systemic Epo pretreatment protects neurons in an acute phase of SE and may result in further suppression of neuronal apoptosis in hippocampus by regulating the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins.

We studied, therefore, the effects of chronic mild stress (CMS) and alcohol drinking on depression-like behavior and nociception in lines of mice selected for high (HA) or low (LA) swim stress-induced analgesia. Compared to the LA mice, the HA animals display up-regulation of opioid receptor system function and depression-like behavior in tail suspension test (TST). We report now that alcohol reverses depressive and pronociceptive effect of CMS in HA mice. In contrast, in LA mice CMS does not affect nociception or behavior in TST and the animals are not susceptible to alcohol under CMS. The results suggest that opioid system activity may determine the effects of alcohol on behavior under stress and, therefore, link predispositions to depression and to alcoholism.",

Intracellular Ca2+ dynamics was studied using the fluorescent probes fura-2 and chlortetracycline to monitor free and bound calcium (Cai and Cab) respectively. In control cortical slices, application of L-glutamate, NMDA and AMPA induced concomitant increases in Cai and Cab, reflecting Ca2+ influx and its intracellular accumulation in neurons. DHPG, an agonist of group I mGlu receptors induced a decrease in Cab accompanied by a rise in Cai levels, indicating Ca2+ mobilization. In cortical slices collected 24 h after severe hypoxia, the responses of Cab to glutamate administration were increased, DHPG-induced shifts were reversed, the increase in Cab after the first application of AMPA was reduced, while after the second, Cab rises were potentiated, and the increases in Cab evoked by NMDA application were slightly suppressed. The alterations of responses in Cab to the selective agonists were completely prevented by preconditioning with mild hypoxia. Our results suggest that protection of normal glutamatergic calcium signaling contributes to tolerance to hypoxia induced by preconditioning.",

    "abstract": "The noble gas xenon (Xe) inhibits not only NMDA receptors (NMDARs), but also the two other subtypes of glutamate receptor i.e. AMPA (AMPARs) and kainate receptors. Preliminary studies on AMPARs suggest that Xe sensitivity might be coupled to receptor desensitization. In order to find out if this hypothesis can be applied to all glutamate receptors, we analyzed additional 'non-desensitizing' AMPARs mutants and compared these with homologous mutants of NMDARs. Membrane currents of Neuro2A or SH-SY5Y cells transfected with cDNA encoding AMPA- or NMDA receptors were investigated by whole cell recordings under voltage clamp conditions. Agonists (glutamate, kainate, NMDA) were applied to the cells by means of a rapid perfusion system. Xenon was preincubated for 20 s before testing it in combination with the particular agonist. Xe (3.5 mM) reduced peak and plateau currents of AMPA wild-type receptors [GluR1(i); GluR2(i,Q)], activated for 5 s with 3 mM glutamate, by 45 and 55%, respectively. With mutant AMPARs showing greatly diminished or abolished desensitization i.e. GluR1(i)_L497Y, GluR1(i)_A636T(Lc), GluR2(i,Q)_R649E and GluR2(i,Q)_A643T(Lc), the reduction by Xe was significantly smaller and varied by between 4 and 20%. In contrast, no difference in the blocking capacity of Xe was observed comparing wild-type NR1-1a/NR2A receptors with receptors having point mutations within NR2A that substantially slowed (NR2A_A651T(Lc)) or accelerated (NR2A_M823W) receptor desensitization. Thus, our data indicate that in AMPARs channel blockade by Xe is related to desensitization, whereas in NMDARs no evidence for such a relation was found. Thus, Xe seems to exert its inhibiting effect on various ionotropic glutamate receptors by different molecular mechanisms.",

However, only a small fraction of the neural stem/progenitor cells survives. In this report, the effects of methylprednisolone (MP) on proliferation, differentiation and survival of neural progenitor cells were explored through early MP administration after occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAo). Transient cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion in Sprague Dawley male rats. One hour, 1 day, 3 days, 14 days, and 28 days after MCAo, neurological examination was performed to evaluate the neurological deficit. MCAo rats were randomly divided into two groups, MP-group was injected MP (30 mg/kg, i.p.) at 3 h, 12 h, and 24 h after MCAo, and vehicle group was injected equal saline (i.p.). Animals were sacrificed at 3 days, 14 days, and 28 days after MCAo. MP was found to decrease apoptosis and TNF-alpha and IL-6 expression at 3 days after MCAo in the ipsilateral striatum. Moreover, MP significantly increased the migrated new neurons (BrdU+/ DCX+) and immature neurons (BrdU+/Tuj1+) at day 14 after MCAo in the ipsilateral striatum. Likewise, MP increased the number of mature neurons (BrdU+/MAP2+) at 28 days after MCAo. However, MP did not affect the progenitor cell proliferation (BrdU+ and Nestin+) at day 3 after MCAo in the subventricular zone (SVZ), but improved the neurological deficit at day 1 and day 3 after MCAo. These results indicate that early MP administration can improve the neurological deficit and enhance the survival of new neurons in the ipsilateral striatum by inhibiting apoptosis and downregulation of inflammatory response after transient cerebral ischemia in rats.",

The approach taken here assumes concrete noun meanings to be intimately related to sensory feature constellations. These features are processed by posterior sensory regions of the brain, e.g. the occipital lobe, which handles visual information. The interpretation of abstract nouns, however, is likely to be more dependent on semantic frames and linguistic context. A greater involvement of more anteriorly located, perisylvian brain areas has previously been found for the processing of abstract words. In the present study, a word association test was carried out in order to compare semantic processing in healthy subjects (n=12) with subjects with aphasia due to perisylvian lesions (n=3) and occipital lesions (n=1). The word associations were coded into different categories depending on their semantic content. A double dissociation was found, where, compared to the controls, the perisylvian aphasic subjects had problems associating to abstract nouns and produced fewer semantic framebased associations, whereas the occipital aphasic subject showed disturbances in concrete noun processing and made fewer semantic feature based associations.",

Thyroid hormones action in the adult brain has not been widely studied. The effects of adult hyperthyroidism are not as well understood as adult hypothyroidism, mainly in hippocampal granular cells. The purpose of the present study is to assess the consequences of adult hormone dysthyroidism (excess/deficiency of TH) on the morphology of dentate granule cells in the hippocampus by performing a quantitative study of dendritic arborizations and dendritic spines using Golgi impregnated material. Hypo-and hyperthyroidism were induced in rats by adding 0.02 percent methimazole and 1 percent L-thyroxine, respectively, to drinking water from 40 days of age. At 89 days, the animals’ brains were removed and stained by a modified Golgi method and blood samples were collected in order to measure T4 serum levels. Neurons were selected and drawn using a camera lucida. Our results show that both methimazole and thyroxine treatment affect granule cell morphology. Treatments provoke alterations in the same direction, namely, reduction of certain dendritic-branching parameters that are more evident in the methimazole than in the thyroxine group. We also observe a decrease in spine density in both the methimazole and thyroxine groups.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal synchronized neuronal discharges mediated by gap junctions have an important role in epileptic seizures. The analysis of anticonvulsant drugs acting on gap junctions is still a priority in epilepsy research. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the effect of carbenoxolone, a gap junction blocker, on the anticonvulsant efficacy of phenytoin in pentylenetetrazole kindled rats. Male Wistar albino rats, 14 weeks of age, were used. In the first step of the study, animals were given PTZ 35 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.) three times a week until kindling was produced. Then, indwelling screw electrodes - allowing EEG monitoring of conscious rats - were implanted into the crania of the kindled rats. In this way, we were able to record EEG activity and evaluate seizure stage at the same time. In the second step of the study, the interaction between carbenoxolone (40 mg/kg i.p.) and phenytoin (60 mg/kg, i.p.) was investigated. The data analysis was performed using a one-way ANOVA with LSD post-hoc test. Total spike number and the generalized seizure duration were reduced in the carbenoxolone treated group compared to the PTZ group. Phenytoin decreased generalized seizure duration, total spike number and seizure severity score. Carbenoxolone and phenytoin have anti-seizure effects in PTZ kindled rats. There was no significant difference between the carbenoxolone + phenytoin combination and phenytoin in terms of generalized seizure duration, total spike number and seizure stage. The results indicate that carbenoxolone combined with phenytoin is not more effective than the use of these drugs alone.",

Research results gathered to date support the hypothesis that the motor symptoms of the disease result from the gradual loss of midbrain dopamine neurons residing in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Recent discoveries, however, significantly expand this knowledge indicating that the primary source of the PD pathogenesis may be located both in the SNpc as well as in the GABAergic striatum. Newly discovered striatal neurogenesis - normally a lifelong process - determines the efficiency of nigrostriatal interaction. Deficient neurogenesis within the striatum followed by a decline in the GABAergic/dopaminergic interaction results in progressive disconnection of the dopaminergic input, which initiates a 'vicious circle' cascade of neuronal damage. Effects of both deficient striatal neurogenesis and age-related neurodegeneration within the striatum accumulate, resulting in a progressive decline in the control functions of the basal ganglia, loss of dopaminergic neurons, and occurrence of PD clinical symptoms. Functional and pharmacological control of these dynamic relationships may result in treatments that are more effective with fewer side-effects.",

    "abstract": "The Mongolian gerbil has been widely used as a global brain ischemia model because of its incomplete cerebral circle of Willis. However, the inter-individual anatomic variability of this vascular structure interferes with the reliability of the model. The aim of this work was to introduce modifications to the protocol of global brain ischemia experiments in Mongolian gerbils in an attempt to increase the reliability and usefulness of this model. Our study focused on the assessment of the level of anastomosis of the cerebral circle of Willis in order to evaluate its contribution to clinicopathological outcomes in this model. Sham-operated, Ischemic, and Ischemic + Hypothermia animals were subjected to a 15-minute occlusion of the common carotid arteries. Transcardiac perfusion with bromophenol blue / gelatin solution was performed 72 hours after ischemia. Brains were processed for anatomopathological analysis. Tissue damage was observed in the hippocampus, caudate-putamen nucleus, neocortex, and thalamic nuclei of animals from the Ischemic group. The circles of Willis of the Sham-operated animals showed bilateral (38 percent), unilateral (48 percent) or no posterior communicating arteries (14 percent). A negative correlation between infarct volume and the level of anastomosis was revealed for the Ischemic, but not for the Ischemic + Hypothermia group. Additionally, Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed to assess the contribution of the level of anastomosis to the clinicopathological outcomes. It was confirmed that the infarct volume decreased in the Ischemic + Hypothermia group when compared to the Ischemic group. Since the level of anastomosis cannot be predicted, this variable should necessarily be considered when analyzing the results of global brain ischemia in Mongolian gerbils.",

There is growing evidence that stem cell-based therapy may positively influence recovery from stroke. Cord blood is an attractive source of ontogenetically young, yet safe, stem cells. Conceptually, preclinical studies in which donor cells were of human origin have been the most valuable, and thus, it is likely that these cells will be used in clinical trials. Unfortunately, immunological barriers impede discordant xenotransplantations. We have previously observed acute rejection of cord blood derived neural stem cells (HUCB-NSC) after transplantation to the brains of intact animals. Since it was reported recently that a brain lesion may actually improve the chances of graft survival, in this study, we used infarcted animals as graft recipients. In ongoing studies, we tested three immunosuppressive regimes: group I received cyclosporine A (CsA: 10 mg per kg i.p.); group II received a triple-drug therapy (CsA: 10 mg per kg i.p., azathioprine: 5 mg per kg i.p., and methylprednisolone: 1.5 mg per kg i.m.); group III included rats that were formerly desensitized with HUCB, group IV had not undergone immunosuppression. Animals were sacrificed at five time-points: 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 days post-transplantation to evaluate graft survival and the time-course of immunological response. We observed a gradual decrease in the number of transplanted cells, with complete disappearance by day 14, surprisingly, with no difference among the experimental groups. The involvement of the innate immune system in the process of graft rejection dominated over an adaptive immunoresponse, with the highest activity on day 3, and subsequent fading of immune cell infiltration. In this work, we have shown that none of our immunosuppressive strategies proved adequate to prevent rejection of human stem cell grafts after transplantation into immunocompetent animals.",

In vivo study showed that pretreatment of piracetam offered significant protection against rotenone induced decreased GSH and increased MDA level though the protection was region specific. But the co-treatment of piracetam with rotenone did not offer significant protection against rotenone induced oxidative stress in ex vivo study. Whereas ex vivo experiments in rat brain homogenate of piracetam pretreated rats, showed the significant protection against rotenone induced oxidative stress. Findings indicated that pretreatment of piracetam significantly attenuated the rotenone induced oxidative stress though the protection was region specific. Piracetam treatment to rats led to its absorption and accumulation in different brain regions as assessed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. In conclusion, study indicates the piracetam is able to enhance the antioxidant capacity in brain cells in region specific manner. The study is also revealing the rationale for its clinical use in cognitive impairment and other neurological diseases.",

As mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, we hypothesized that changes in brain mitochondria occur due to vascular calcification induced by renal failure and the opening of the mitochondrial potassium channel using nicorandil may prevent its dysfunction. Brain tissues from rats with vascular calcification were studied. Nicorandil (7.5 mg/kg b.wt.) was given either concomitantly or after the induction of calcification. The brain tissues were evaluated for antioxidant capacity, mitochondrial enzymes and oxidative phosphorylation efficiency along with the progression of calcification. The results suggested that renal failure, elevated the calcium, phosphorus product in the brain. The brain cytoplasm and mitochondrial fractions showed an elevated TBARS and a corresponding decline in the antioxidant enzymes, indicating a sev ere oxidative stress. The elevated brain mitochondrial enzymes like NADH dehydrogenase, and succinate dehydrogenase in the disease control groups, reversed to the near control level after nicorandil treatment. We observed that nicorandil was more effective when given after calcification. It reduced the biochemical alterations associated with calcium and phosphorous toxicity in the brain, by preserving mitochondria, the key target for treating neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "This study examined low-frequency ultrasonic vocalizations (lUSVs) in rats during two types of sexual interactions; postejaculatory interval (PEI) and barrier - noncontact (NC) test. We report distinct classes of lUSVs that can be assigned to different emotional states; relaxation vs. frustration. Totally flat, 22-kHz calls (Class A), were observed during the relaxation state following ejaculation; characterized by immobilization or grooming during the PEI. On the other hand, two-three component lUSVs (Class B) that start at a higher frequency (45-kHz: flat, upward or short signal) and then shift to 35-23-kHz (mostly to 28-23-kHz), correspond as we assume, to arousal and frustration - active states associated with sniffing a hole or exploration during the NC test. We suggest that momentary, abrupt decreases of arousal during the frustration state correspond to Class B lUSVs. The detailed spectral analysis of the high-frequency component of two-component lUSVs is crucial for establishing the relationship between such lUSVs and the corresponding behavior and emotional states. Our studies indicate that while the two-component Class B 22-kHz lUSVs may relate to the frustration state, a single component, flat, Class A lUSV relates to the relaxation state. The results of these studies support a notion that rats emit distinct vocalization patterns, reflecting their emotional states.",

Blood was collected from the jugular vein 4 h after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). After venous blood was collected, the rats were decapitated immediately, and brain ischemic penumbra samples were collected. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to observe the histopathological changes. Penumbra and blood miRNAs were measured by miRNA microarray and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. MicroRNA profiles differed between hyperacute ischemic stroke and sham-operated rats. The expression of some miRNAs changed by more than 1.5-fold in the penumbra and blood 4 h after pMCAO; among those miRNAs, several were upregulated and several were downregulated. MiR-223-3p was found to be highly expressed in both the penumbra and the blood 4 h after pMCAO, and let-7b-3p was found to have low expression in both the penumbra and the blood 4 h after pMCAO. Moreover, miR-223-3p and let-7b-3p expression in blood and brain ischemic penumbra were positively correlated. The results show that select blood miRNAs may correlate with miRNA changes in the penumbra in a rat model of hyperacute ischemic stroke. Our findings suggest the potential usefulness of blood miR-223-3p and let-7b-3p as noninvasive bio markers for the diagnosis of hyperacute ischemic stroke.",

    "abstract": "The expression pattern of aromatase (ARO), the enzyme converting androgens to estrogens, was analyzed in the olfactory bulb of adult male rats and was compared with the distribution of estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta), the main estrogen receptor isoform expressed in this brain region. A strong ARO immunolabeling obtained with a specificity tested antibody was observed in juxtaglomerular neurons of the glomerular layer and a weaker immunoreaction was detected in the mitral cell layer of the main olfactory bulb, while the granule cell layer of the main olfactory bulb as well as all layers in the accessory olfactory bulb showed faint immunolabeling. Fluorescence double labeling experiments revealed that ARO detected in juxtaglomerular neurons of the main olfactory bulb colocalized with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67), while no colocalization between ARO and the calcium binding proteins calretinin (CR) and calbindin (CB) was observed. Furthermore, the TH immunoreactive neurons expressed metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) too. ERβ immunoreactivity, in contrast to ARO, was detected in all layers of both the main and accessory olfactory bulb. In the glomerular layer of the main olfactory bulb it was expressed in TH and GAD67 containing juxtaglomerular neurons, and it colocalized with CR, CB and even with glial fibrillary acidic protein too. Our morphological findings suggest that ARO expression is a novel feature of dopaminergic/GABAergic juxtaglomerular neurons in the adult rat main olfactory bulb, and raise the possibility that ARO activity may change in function of olfactory input via mGluR1. In situ estrogen production in the olfactory bulb in turn may modulate interglomerular circuits through ERbeta.",

Principal component analysis conducted on the selected cognitive test variables yielded three expected EF components.

    "abstract": "Enriched environments and exercise provide complex environmental stimulation that can induce emotional and cognitive changes; however, few studies have evaluated the effects of these two components on other behaviours, such as novelty seeking or pain sensitivity. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of voluntary physical activity provided through different housing conditions on anxiety, locomotor activity, pain sensitivity, and exploration. Male mice at postnatal day (PND) 21 and were randomly assigned to one of four different conditions on PND 28: Marlau cages (MC), a standardized cage designed to provide a complex environment; physical exercise in large groups (PE‑8); physical exercise in small groups (PE‑4); or a standard environment (SE). After seven weeks, animals were evaluated in the hole‑board task, the elevated zero maze, actimeter, and hot plate test. In the hole‑board task, MC animals displayed more exploration than animals in the PE‑8 and PE‑4 groups, but no significant differences were observed between groups in the actimeter. In the elevated zero maze, MC and PE‑8 animals exhibited an anxiogenic‑like profile as compared to the SE group. When pain sensitivity was evaluated, the PE‑8 group displayed a higher sensitivity to noxious thermal stimuli than the SE group. These data suggest that the complexity of the environment in which physical activity and environmental stimulation are provided can influence animal behaviours such as novelty seeking, emotional response, and pain sensitivity. These animal models could be useful for designing more personalized interventions that include physical, social, and cognitive stimulation to promote a more active lifestyle in humans. Such interventions could be useful in the prevention and treatment of aging‑related decline or neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neuropsychiatric hepatic‑induced syndrome in which several factors are involved in promoting brain perturbations, with ammonia being the primary factor. Motor impairment, incoordination, and gut dysbiosis are some of the well‑known symptoms of HE. Nevertheless, the link between the direct effect of hyperammonemia and associated gut dysbiosis in the pathogenesis of HE is not well established. Thus, this work aimed to assess motor function in hyperammonemia and gut dysbiosis in mice. Twenty‑eight Swiss mice were distributed into three groups: two‑week and four‑week hyperammonemia groups were fed with an ammonia‑rich diet (20% w/w), and the control group was pair‑fed with a standard diet. Motor performance in the three groups was measured through a battery of motor tests, namely the rotarod, parallel bars, beam walk, and static bars. Microbial analysis was then carried out on the intestine of the studied mice. The result showed motor impairments in both hyperammonemia groups. Qualitative and quantitative microbiological analysis revealed decreased bacterial load, diversity, and ratios of both aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria, following two and four weeks of ammonia supplementation. Moreover, the Shannon diversity index revealed a time‑dependent cutback of gut bacterial diversity in a treatment‑time‑dependent manner, with the presence of only Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcaceae, and Enterococcaceaeat at four weeks. The data showed that ammonia‑induced motor coordination deficits may develop through direct and indirect pathways acting on the gut‑brain axis.",

Chronic METH use leads to neurotoxicity characterized by various molecular and structural alterations in the brain. This review article primarily aims to elucidate the mechanisms underlying METH‑induced neurotoxicity. METH’s mechanism of action involves the inhibition of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine reuptake, resulting in altered synaptic function. Prolonged METH exposure triggers oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired axonal transport, autophagy, and programmed cell death, ultimately contributing to neurotoxicity. These neurotoxic effects manifest as increased neuronal firing rate, disruptions in intracellular ion balance (Ca2+ and Na+), energy production imbalances, and excessive reactive oxygen species production. The blood‑brain barrier is compromised, leading to structural, functional, and neurochemical alterations, particularly in the fronto‑striatal circuit. While our comprehensive review addresses these intricate molecular and structural changes induced by METH, we also examined the latest therapeutic strategies designed to mitigate neurotoxicity. Our investigation sheds light on the critical need to comprehend the complex pathways underlying METH‑induced neurotoxicity and develop effective treatment approaches.",

Alterations in the status of the peripheral immune system induced by an invading pathogen for example, are quickly detected by the central nervous system, which then responds by altering physiological processes and behavior in an attempt to support the immune system in its efforts to eliminate the pathogen. Sleep is one of several behaviors that are dramatically altered in response to infection. Immune-active substances such as the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-l and tumor necrosis factor, either directly or indirectly via interactions with neurotransmitters or neurohormones are involved in the regulation of sleep. Because these cytokines increase during infection, they are likely candidates for mediating the profound alterations in sleep that occur during infection. Since regulation of behavior is the function of the central nervous system, infection-induced alterations in behavior provide a unique model for the study of neuro-immune interactions.",

We found that what we call KL-complexity of the signal differs profoundly for the signals registered in different EEG channels, from about 5-8 for signals in frontal channels up to 40 and more in occipital ones. But no consistency in the influence of Diazepam administration on KL-complexity is observed. We also estimated the embedding dimension of the EEG signals of the same subjects, which turned to be between 7 and 11, so endorsing the presumption about existence of low-dimensional chaotic attractor. We are sure that nonlinear time series analysis can be used to investigate the dynamics underlying the generation of EEG signal. This approach does not seem practical yet, but deserves further study.",

    "abstract": "Forty-eight hours fasting profoundly suppresses LH secretion in female rats. The following neural pathway mediating fasting-induced suppression of LH secretion has been suggested by a series of experiment: a signal associated with fasting emanating from the upper digestive tract reaches the A2 region in the medulla oblongata via afferent vagal nerve so as to activate the noradrenergic pathway projecting to the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN); this results in an increased corticotropin-releasing hormone release to suppress LHRH release and then LH release. The PVN and A2 region of the medulla oblongata are the estrogen feedback sites to activate the above-mentioned neural pathway. The estrogen feedback action on the PVN and A2 region is considered to be due to an increased expression of estrogen receptors in these nuclei after 48-h fasting. The response of gonadal axis during fasting could be due to the changes in some nutrients, such as glucose and free-fatty acids. In this context, malnutrition could be a kind of stress accompanied by an increased feeding behavior and decreased gonadal activity.",

This EEG pattern has been extensively studied since 1938, when Jüng and Kornmüller (1938) demonstrated the first theta recordings in the hippocampal formation of rabbits. In 1986 in collaboration with Drs. B.H. Bland, S.H. Roth and B.M. MacIver we demonstrated for the first time that bath perfusion of hippocampal slices with the cholinergic agonist, carbachol, resulted in theta-like oscillations. Since this initial demonstration of in vitro theta-like activity, we have carried out a number of experiments in an attempt to answer the basic question: what are the similarities between cholinergic-induced in vitro theta-like activity and theta rhythm which naturally occurs in the in vivo preparation. Thus far, our studies have provided strong evidence that theta-like activity recorded in vitro shares many of the physiological and pharmacological properties of theta rhythm observed in vivo. The question whether in vitro theta-like oscillations reflect features of epileptiform activity is also addressed in this review.",

We applied the model of acute Pb toxicity in vivo, imitating the acute action of lead observed in occupationally exposed workers or in occasional incidents of poisoning. The measurement of Pb levels in the synaptosomal fraction exhibited its significant accumulation under applied conditions. Oxygen consumption increased in synaptosomes from Pb-treated rats whereas the activity of cytochrome c oxidase did not change. The intrasynaptosomal levels of ATP and CrP were significantly elevated, as was the activity of creatine kinase, suggesting the activation of the CrP/CK system. On the other hand, the activity of the synaptosomal Na+,K(+)-ATP-ase decreased. We suggest that under acute Pb toxicity conditions the mobilization of CrP/CK system may take place to protect the cell against the effects of decreased Na+,K(+)-ATP-ase activity.",

In both groups of operated cats, except those in which the lesion was essentially confined to dorsal columns, three different forms of impairment of fore-hindlimb coordination were observed, depending on the extent of lesion: (1) a change of locomotion towards pacing with preservation of the equality rhythms in the fore- and the hindlimbs; (2) episodes of fore- and hindlimb rhythm dissociation and (3) a permanent dissociation of the fore- and hindlimb rhythms. A comparison of the results obtained in these two groups of operated cats points to the more important role played by the lateral funiculi, than by other parts of the spinal white matter, in controlling the fore-hindlimb coordination in cats.",

In a series of pioneering studies Konorski demonstrated basic differences between the two types of conditioned reflexes. After the Second World War, he reinterpreted the results of research on conditioned reflexes on the basis of the mechanisms of Sherringtonian neurophysiology and introduced the term plasticity of the nervous system. His work, \"Conditioned reflexes and neuron organization\", published in 1948, signaled Konorski's place as one of the founders of contemporary neuroscience. He contributed significantly to the understanding of complex interactions of various classes of behaviors: innate and acquired, those driven by opposite motivations, and those elicited by cues signaling different contingencies.

The results of studies conducted so far indicate that photic information flowing from ganglion cells of the retina is necessary for its generation. On the other hand, this circuit is maintained thanks to the oscillatory activity of GABAergic interneurons, the majority of which build up this structure, mainly in combination with neuropeptide Y and enkephalins. The activity of non-specific projections of the brain, whose terminals are present in the intergeniculate leaflet, modulates the slow oscillation circuit of the leaflet neurons, without changing its oscillatory pattern, though. Our hypothesis predicts a role of the oscillatory activity of intergeniculate leaflet neurons in facilitation the secretion of neuropeptides and neurohormones present in the very elements making up the mechanism of mammalian biological clock and structures linked to it. This constitutes a kind of functional junction between the central mechanism of mammalian biological clock with an ultradian rhythm and its peripheral clocks whose rhythm is circadian.",

To evaluate the level of sleep and to record cortical evoked responses screw electrodes were implanted over the occipital cortex. Two hours before overnight recordings, two hook electrodes were injected intraperitoneally (under light Ketanest anesthesia) and anchored in gut. Using these electrodes, electric stimulation was applied during slow wave sleep, and in wakefulness. Cortical evoked responses to intraperitoneal stimulation were found indeed during sleep in experiments with M1 and M2.

Visual field maps of double-pulse resolution thresholds (DPR) (the minimum detectable temporal gap between two light stimuli) and simple visual reaction times (RT) (measuring the speed of reaction to a light stimulus) were compared to maps of luminance thresholds determined by standard perimetry. Thus, for the first time, the topography of a visual variable without temporal constraints (perimetry) could be compared to visual variables in the temporal domain, with (RT) and without (DPR) motor reaction. The goal of the study was to obtain and to describe the pattern of co-variation of performance indicators. In all three measures, performance was best in the central visual field and dropped significantly towards the periphery. Although the correlation between DPR and RT was significant, shared variance was low, and we observed large topographical differences between these two temporal-performance variables. In contrast, DPR and perimetric thresholds correlated more substantially, and visual field maps were similar. The Gestalt of DPR maps shares characteristics of basic visual processing (e.g., light sensitivity), but it also reflects top-down influences, i.e., from spatial attention. Although the correlation between DPR and RT suggests common characteristics between these two temporal variables, the topographic distributions reveal significant differences, indicating separate underlying processing mechanisms.",

Sixteen physicians recruited from the university hospitals participated in the study. Each participant served as his own control. All participants underwent two test sessions including the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Selective Reminding Test (SRT), and the Continuous Attention Test (CAT). The CAT items were used as stimuli in event-related potential (ERP) recordings. EEG was recorded from 21 electrodes, according to the international 10-20 system. The sources of bioelectrical activity were computed with low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Estimated sleep time was significantly shorter on nights spent on duty than on nights of normal sleep at home. Sleep loss resulted in significant increase in SSS and BDI scoring, and impairment of immediate recall. Performance on the CAT remained relatively intact. Under the sleep loss condition compared to baseline, significant differences in brain activity occurred only for targets. Within the P1 time frame, sleep loss led to greater activation in the right Brodmann’s area 9/10. For the N1 component, significant differences were localized on the lateral surface of the right frontal lobe, in Brodmann’s areas 8 and 9. No significant effects of sleep deprivation on the P3 component were found. Our results are consistent with earlier data indicating that increased activation of the prefrontal cortex allows the maintainance of performance during periods of sleep loss.",

The hippocampus showed a regional vulnerability in the pups exposed to maternal thiamine deficiencies. It appears that the thiamine deficiency decreased nuclear density (27.20%) more severely than nuclear size (10.56%) in the fetal hippocampus.

Numerous experiments indicate that bone marrow stromal cells play an important role in the repair of injured brain tissue and also support healing processes. Findings of in vitro and in vivo studies show that these cells have an ability to differentiate into cells of multiple tissues, including neurons and glial cells and to secrete an array of growth factors and cytokines, which have an influence on repair of damaged tissue. In addition, treatment of traumatic brain injury with bone marrow stromal cells promotes functional recovery of injured animals. Taking this into consideration, there is hope for using bone marrow stromal cells in brain injury therapy, which is very difficult because of specific events that occur in the pathological conditions. However, mechanisms responsible for the observed therapeutic potential of bone marrow stromal cells still remain unclear. The review presents achievements in studies on bone marrow stromal cells as a source of therapeutic benefits in treatment of traumatic brain injury and addresses the question of their possible future use in clinical trials.",

In this study, we determined the sensitivity of neurons and neuroblastoma cells on apoptosis and necrosis induction upon quercetin treatment. No expression of Hsp72 was observed in neurons, which were more sensitive to cell death upon quercetin treatment than neuroblastoma cells, where Hsp72 expression was observed. Reduction of Hsp72 gene expression in neuroblastoma cells by antisense oligonucleotides made them more sensitive to pro-apoptotic action of quercetin. Moreover, the flavonoid decreased Hsp27, procaspase-3, MRP and PKB expression in neuroblastoma cells and in neurons. Nuclear localization of mainly cytoplasmic Hsp27 was observed in neuroblastoma cells after treatment with high quercetin concentrations, while in neurons, the protein was present in nuclei both in control and quercetin treated cells. Our results suggest that quercetin induce apoptosis more effectively in cells with low level of Hsp 72 expression. Higher sensitivity of neurons for cell death after treatment with high quercetin concentrations in comparison to neuroblastoma cell line should also be taken into consideration in further studies on using studied flavonoid as therapeutic agent.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to examine whether celecoxib influences clonic seizure thresholds through modulation of nitric oxidergic (NO) pathway. The effect of celecoxib (1-5 mg per kg, p.o.) was investigated on clonic seizures induced by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ, 50 and 80 mg per kg, i.p.) in male Swiss mice. The interaction of celecoxib-induced effects with NO pathway was examined using a NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor, N(G)-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 20 and 50 mg per kg, i.p.) and a NOS substrate, L-arginine (100 and 200 mg per kg, i.p.). The criteria for the development of seizure activity were the possibility for appearance of generalized clonus and prolongation of latency to the onset of convulsions following administration of 50 and 80 mg per kg of PTZ, respectively. Pretreatment with celecoxib (2.5 and 5 mg per kg) or L-NAME (50 mg per kg) induced anticonvulsant effect on the PTZ-induced clonic seizures. L-arginine at the dose of 200 mg per kg had proconvulsant effect. A sub-effective dose of celecoxib (1 mg per kg) induced an additive anticonvulsant effect when co-administered with L-NAME (20 mg per kg). Although L-arginine (100 mg per kg) per se did not influence PTZ-induced convulsion, it could attenuate the anticonvulsant effect of celecoxib (5 mg per kg). Our results indicate that celecoxib induces an anticonvulsant effect on clonic seizure threshold that may involve NO pathway.",

For vertical strokes shorter than, or of the same height as strokes delimiting the standard, the length was over-reproduced consistently with earlier studies of the illusion. However, for vertical strokes three times longer than the delimiters, the illusory effect paradoxically decreased, and attained negative values in two of six subjects.

Location of the dentate gyrus (DG) and perforant path (PP) is usually achieved using brain stereotaxic atlasses. Because the data in the atlasses were obtained from a particular rat/mouse strain (Rat: adult Wistar, 290 g; Mouse: adult C57BL/J6, 26-30 g), the data in atlases could not be easily applied in all the different other strains of these species.

In the present report, we challenged this view based on microscopic analysis of neocortex in a genetic model of absence epilepsy, WAG/Rij rats. Density of neurons and glial cells was measured in the motor, somatosensory and cingular cortical areas in epileptic WAG/Rij rats and in non-epileptic control ACI rats. More extensive and significant differences between two strains were found in a population of glial cells and less significant - in neurons. In contract to ACI rats, WAG/Rij rats showed (1) a deficit of glial cells and a lower glia-neuron index in the somatosensory and cingulate areas (deep layers); (2) a reduced number of neurons locally in the motor cortex. The somatosensory cortex (deep layers) is known to play a key role in triggering of epileptic discharges, and an impairment of glia-neuron interactions in this area might underlie pathological processes in a primary epileptic focus. In the motor cortex, epileptiform activity is known to reach the highest amplitude, and this may cause or result from a deficit of neurons. Our data suggest the critical role of glial cells and glia-neuron interactions in pathogenesis of absence epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Emotional stress is considered a serious pathogenetic factor of depression. In this study an ultrasound model of emotional stress developed in our laboratory was applied. It is characterized by the use of ultrasound as the stressor agent. Animals are triggered not by any organic or physical disturbances but by the perception of adverse information. This type of stress can induce depressive-like behavioral changes in rodents, manifested by decreased sucrose preference and increased time of immobility in a forced swim test. Ultrasound stress also increased the levels of oxidative stress markers. This is important, as stress has an established association with increased oxidative processes in the central nervous system. Total glutathione and carbonyl protein content were selected as relevant brain markers, as glutathione plays a critical role in cellular defensive mechanisms during oxidative stress and the level of protein carbonyls can be a measure of global protein oxidation. We demonstrated that two weeks of chronic exposure to ultrasound was enough to cause depressive-like behavioral changes in rats. Increased levels of oxidative stress markers in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were also observed after two weeks of such stress. The current study has two goals: the first is to study the relationship of depression and oxidative stress; the second is an additional validation of our approach to modeling stress‑induced depressive-like states in rats. The present data further support the validity of the ultrasound model by expanding information related to the influence of ultrasound stress on behavioral and physiological parameters, which are of great importance in the development of stress-induced depression. A time correlation between the onset of symptoms and a change in the level of oxidative stress markers in the brain is also demonstrated.",

The present study focused on the specific question whether a secondary language experience influences temporal order perception by comparing the temporal order thresholds (TOTs) between Chinese subjects with and without a secondary non-tonal language (i.e., English) experience. Besides monaurally presented paired clicks, binaurally presented two different types of tone pairs were used in order to better capture a potential difference between tonal and non-tonal languages. The results showed a non-significant language effect on monaurally presented click TOTs, but a significant language effect for binaurally presented tone TOTs. Compared to click performance, Chinese subjects without English proficiency demonstrated a significantly lower TOT only for close frequency tone pairs, while Chinese subjects with English proficiency demonstrated lower TOTs for both close frequency and distant frequency tone pairs. These results confirm on the one hand a common and language independent temporal mechanism for perceiving the order of two monaurally presented stimuli, and indicate on the other hand specific mechanisms of neuronal plasticity for perceiving the order of frequency-related auditory stimuli for tonal language speakers with or without a secondary non-tonal language experience.",

We aimed to identify the effects of aging on phaselocking measures of 40 Hz ASSR. The effect of aging was tested in a sample of 46 healthy male subjects (20-58 years old) during eyes open condition. Stimuli were 500 ms trains, consisting of 20 identical clicks (1.5 ms burst of white noise) delivered binaurally. Time-frequency analysis of the data was performed and phase-locking index, evoked amplitude and total intensity measures were extracted and decomposed by non-negative multi-way factorization. As shown by curve-fitting analyses, phase-locking index and evoked amplitudes were diminishing with age in the linear manner. This was also proven by ANOVA testing when sample was divided into age groups. No effect of age on the total intensity was found. The complexity of the factors modulating the 40 Hz ASSR is not entirely solved; nevertheless, the current results suggest that the ability to synchronize to high frequency external stimulation diminishes with age. This should be taken into account, particularly when ASSRs are used in clinical practice, comparing patients and healthy subjects.",

Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) can induce astrocyte proliferation by increasing hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-1alpha) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Here, we studied whether LIF affects the proliferation of cultured primary rat astrocytes under OGD conditions by measuring EdU incorporation into astrocyte DNA and the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) mRNA and protein. Our findings show that low concentrations of LIF (5 and 10 ng/mL) significantly decreased EdU incorporation and downregulated the expression of PCNA mRNA and PCNA protein in astrocytes subjected to OGD. A low concentration of LIF (10 ng/mL) clearly inhibited astrocyte proliferation induced by OGD, while a higher concentration (50 ng/mL) had no effect. To investigate the mechanism of this inhibition by LIF (10 ng/mL), the expression of 3 related genes (LIF receptor, HIF-1alpha, and VEGF) was assessed using real-time PCR; VEGF protein expression was measured by Western blot. Our results indicate that LIFR mRNA was downregulated in astrocytes subjected to OGD. Interestingly, treatment with LIF further reduced LIFR mRNA expression in these cells. LIF treatment also decreased the expression of HIF-1alpha mRNA, VEGF mRNA, and VEGF protein induced by OGD. Low concentrations of LIF were observed to inhibit astrocyte proliferation induced by OGD.",

Recent research has proven the functional interactions between opioid and endogenous cannabinoid system in the central nervous system (CNS). The cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1-R) is one of the receptors that mediate the actions of cannabinoids and endocannabinoids in the CNS. Here, we investigated the expression of CB1-R in mRNA and protein levels in the brains of rats treated with acute and repeated morphine. Three groups of rats received intraperitoneal injections (ip injections) of saline, acute morphine (10 mg/kg) and repeated morphine (10 mg/kg, twice daily for 12 consecutive days), and the mRNA levels and protein expressions of CB1-R were examined. RT-PCR and western blot analyses supported that both mRNA and protein levels of CB1-R in cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus were increased by repeated morphine treatment. However, the mRNA level in cerebellum was down-regulated only after acute morphine treatment and would returned to basal levels later. We used immunohistochemistry techniques to determine the functional expression of CB1-R in morphine treated rat’s brain. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) revealed the significant increase of cytokine (IL-1beta, IL-6) levels in the repeated morphine treatment rats’ cortex and hippocampus regions, which are both addiction-related brain areas. In addition, the results from RT-PCR and western blot assay indicated that the expression of CB1-R was directly increased by morphine treatment in vitro. All the results indicated that the CB1-R expression could be changed by morphine exposure and it might be involved in neural immune function, which provided a potential target for neurogenic disease treatment.",

    "abstract": "Transplantation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) for spinal cord injury (SCI) has been shown to improve functional outcome. BMSCs can be easily obtained from bone marrow aspirate and have fewer problems in the clinical application for human SCI from the ethical and legal points of view. Recently, we produced cells with neural stem and/or progenitor cell property and neural regeneration supporting capacity from human bone marrow stromal cells (human bone marrow stroma cell-derived neuroregenerative cells: hBMSC-NRs). The aim of the present study was to clarify the effectiveness of transplantation of hBMSC-NRs to injured spinal cord of severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice. Neurite outgrowth assay of PC-12 cells was performed. One week after a T9-level contusion SCI, hBMSCs or hBMSC-NRs were transplanted into the spinal cord. After the transplantation, functional and histological examinations were performed. Conditioned media of hBMSC-NRs significantly promoted the neurite outgrowth of PC-12 cells in vitro. Transplanted hBMSC-NRs survived in the injured spinal cord 8 weeks after SCI. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the density of serotonin-positive fibers of the transplanted group was significantly higher than that of the control group at the epicenter and caudal segment to the injured site. The recovery of hind limb function of the hBMSC-NRs group was significantly better than that of the control group. In conclusion, hBMSC-NRs can be one of the realistic candidates for cell transplantation therapy for human SCI.",

    "abstract": "In psychophysical experiments, subjects reported whether the filled part of the Oppel-Kundt stimulus was longer than the empty one at different durations of the stimuli presentations. The experimental data yielded a smooth function indicating a gradual augmentation of the illusion strength within a relatively wide 100–1000 ms interval of the exposure durations. On the contrary, the experiments with the Müller-Lyer stimuli showed a gradual decrease of the illusion magnitude within the same interval of expositions. In the supplementary experiments, the stimuli with uniformly filled or outlined rectangles of fixed duration were used; various combinations of the rectangles with the regular sequences of filling stripes were also taken. It was demonstrated that the superposition of the stimuli did not change the illusion strength noticeably. The results obtained in the study support the suggestion that the filled interval overestimation in the Oppel-Kundt stimulus may be related to spatiotemporal integration along a continuous path of neural excitation evoked by the real and illusory contours of the filling.",

However, the effects of M. rubra and C. mas on epilepsy has not been known. This study evaluates the effects of M. rubra and C. mas extracts on penicillin-induced epileptiform activity. Sixty Wistar rats randomly divided into ten groups (n=6): control, sham, penicillin, penicillin+M. rubra extract (2.5, 5, 10, 20 mg/kg) and penicillin+C. mas extract (2.5, 5, 10 mg/kg). Epileptiform activity was induced by using penicillin (500 IU, i.c.) and electrocorticogram records (150 min) were obtained. Also, biochemical analysis in blood samples were evaluated. According to the electrocorticogram analysis, the effective dose was detected as 10 mg/kg for both C. mas and M. rubra. This dose decreased the spike frequencies of convulsions while amplitude wasn't changed by both substances. In erythrocyte studies, there were significant differences regarding nitric oxide in the control, sham and penicillin groups. There were significant differences regarding malondialdehyde in all groups. In the plasma, there were significant differences among groups regarding xanthine oxidase in the penicillin‑C. mas and penicillin‑M. rubra groups. There were differences regarding malondialdehyde in the penicillin-C. mas and M. rubra-C. mas groups. Both extracts reduced the frequency of epileptiform activity. After administration of the extracts malondialdehyde levels decreased also in both erythrocytes and plasma.",

Recent works suggest an additional relationship between alpha rhythm and the Default Mode Network (DMN). We simultaneously recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals in 36 young males asked to alternately close and open their eyes in 30‑s blocks. Using an EEG source channel montage (the recorded signal was interpolated to designated source positions corresponding to certain brain regions) we found an alpha rhythm sub‑activity composed of its intrinsic events, called alpha bursting segments (ABS). More ABS were observed on source channels related to the DMN than those located over the OCC. Similarly, both the beamformer source analysis and fMRI indicated that the specific ABS activity detected on the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC) source channel was less related to the OCC than to the DMN source channels. The fMRI analysis performed using the PCC‑ABS as a general linear model regressor indicated an increased blood oxygenation level‑dependent signal change in DMN nodes - precuneus and prefrontal cortex. These results confirm the OCC source of alpha activity a nd additional specific sources of ABS in the DMN.",

This review provides an overview of food‑drug interaction in the treatment of neurological and psychological diseases. A literature search was carried out by collecting data from different reviews, reports, and original articles on general or specific drug interactions with food, in patients with a variety of neurological and psychological diseases. Based on our review, we found that food‑drug interactions may alter the expected impact of drug, or cause the development of a drug toxicity. Nutritional status of the patients may also be affected, particularly a change in body weight caused by a change appetite. Metabolism, absorption, and excretion of foods may also be altered, and nutritional insufficiencies may occur. Recent studies show that diet can have a strong influence on gut microbiota and thus, alter drug pharmacokinetics. Therefore, microbiota alterations should also be considered while assessing food‑drug interactions. Knowledge of food‑drug interactions is critical for improving health of patients with neurological and psychological diseases, and also for improving effectiveness of treatments.",

    "abstract": "Charcot‑Marie‑Tooth type 1A (CMT1A) is a dysmyelinating disease of the peripheral nervous system that results in a slow progressive weakening and wasting of the distal muscles of the upper and lower limbs. Despite extensive research and clinical trials there is still no treatment for CMT1A that results in complete neurological improvement. Recent studies investigating various pharmacological modulators of adenylyl cyclase activity, including ascorbic acid and ligands of G protein‑coupled receptors (GPCRs), provide hope for future treatments of this type of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy. A review of mechanisms of action of several compounds tested for CMT1A in pre‑clinical and clinical studies ascorbic acid, onapristone, PXT3003 (baclofen, naltrexone, and sorbitol), and ADX71441, very clearly indicates an important role for adenylyl cyclase activity and GPCRs in the pathomechanism of the disease. Metabotropic γ‑aminobutyric acid receptors (GABABR), subtype mu (μ) opioid receptors (MOR), and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mACh) appear to be particularly significant in both pathogenesis and treatment, and their activation may exert a similar and synergistic effect on the physiology of Schwann cells as well as neurons. These receptors participate in proliferation and differentiation of Schwann cells and influence excitatory transmission in neurons. We also hypothesize that onapristone might act through a non‑classical mechanism via membrane progesterone receptor (mPR) and cAMP signaling. This review endeavors to outline a pathway leading inversely from therapy to an indispensable role for adenylyl cyclase activity and GPCRs in the modulation of dosage sensitive peripheral myelin protein (PMP22) gene expression.",

Recent human and animal studies suggest that antenatal opioid exposure impacts the developing brain. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of perinatal methadone exposure on myelination in multiple regions in the developing rat brain. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned into three experimental groups and subsequently exposed to drinking water alone or drinking water containing methadone from 7 days post coitum through day 7 or through day 19 after delivery. Two male neonatal rats were randomly selected from each litter and terminated at day 19. The cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and brainstem were dissected and analyzed for three myelin specific proteins - CNP, PLP, and MBP - by Western blot analysis. All pups with exposure to methadone demonstrated decreased expression of CNP, PLP, and MBP in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. In the cerebellum, PLP expression was down‑regulated without apparent alteration of CNP and MBP expression. PLP and MBP expression, but not CNP expression, were significantly inhibited in the brainstem. Compared to the pups with postnatal methadone exposure via maternal milk through day 7, partial recovery of CNP and PLP expression only occurred in the cerebral cortices of the pups exposed through day 19. The findings show that antenatal opioid exposure in rat pups is associated with regionally‑specific alterations in brain myelination that diversely affects myelin proteins.",

Using the NSs culture system, we examined the size, number of NSs and their fate when exposed to differentiation conditions. Based on immunocytochemical analyses for cell markers (MAP 2, GFAP, RIP) we evaluated the occurrence of various cell types: neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. The results show that NSs increased in size during cultivation time via NPC proliferation, but proliferation potential decreased Turing maturation stages. In addition, NPCs derived from spinal cord developmentally different stages gave rise to a consistent ratio of glial and neuronal progeny (3:1), and adult tissues represent a comparable source of NPCs compared to embryonal and early postnatal tissues. These data provide useful information for large-scale in vitro expansion of NPCs required for potential cell therapy after spinal cord injury.",

Ascorbic acid was administered intraperitoneally (ip) during three different swimming exercise programme for 90 days (15 min, 30 min, 90 min/day). The anticonvulsant activity regarding the frequency of epileptiform activity appeared in the 80 min after 500 units intracortical penicillin injection in 30 min and 90 min/day exercise groups. The administration of ascorbic acid (100 mg/kg, ip) did not alter the anticonvulsant properties seen in the in short-duration (15 min/day) swimming exercise group.

After a complete spinal injury, cats re-express hindlimb locomotion after 2–3 weeks because of a spinal locomotor circuitry named the central pattern generator or CPG. To investigate whether such circuits are also implicated in the recovery of locomotion after partial spinal lesions, we have used a dual spinal lesion paradigm. Essentially, after an initial unilateral hemisection, cats spontaneously recover quadrupedal locomotion. When a complete section is then performed 3 weeks after this hemisection, cats can walk with the hindlimbs within 24 hours compared to 2–3 weeks in cats with single complete spinal lesions demonstrating the importance of spinal mechanisms after partial lesions. Using kinematic and electromyographic methods to evaluate the changes throughout the dual lesion paradigm, we could show that the spinal cord reorganizes spontaneously without locomotor training or with training provided between the partial and complete spinal lesion. To assess spinal lesions we have used histology and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We will describe some advanced MRI techniques such as diffusion and magnetization transfer, which provide higher specificity to axon degeneration and demyelination. Examples of advanced MRI techniques in cats and humans are described, including the current limitations and perspectives.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral ischemic stroke (CIS) is a significant cause of disability and death. Inflammation usually occurs after CIS and accelerates cellular damage. NLRP3 plays a key role in the formation of CIS‑associated inflammasome. Understanding how NLRP3 is regulated bears great importance. We hypothesized that lncRNA NEAT1 can downregulate NLRP3 expression by regulating the miR‑10b‑5p/BCL6 axis, and thus regulate microglia‑driven inflammation. The expression of NEAT1 was analyzed in CIS patients and an in vitro model of oxygen and glucose deprivation/re‑oxygenation (OGD/R). We assessed the levels of pro‑inflammatory cytokines IL‑18 and IL‑1β with ELISA. Interactions between NEAT1/miR‑10b‑5p and miR‑10b‑5p/BCL6 were determined by luciferase assay. The interaction of BCL6 and NLRP3 was identified by ChIP; RNA, and protein levels were evaluated by qRT‑PCR and western blot, respectively. We found that NEAT1 level was decreased in CIS patients and OGD/R treated cells. OGD/R exerted pro‑inflammasome effects by increasing the expression of inflammasome‑associated proteins and ROS and malondialdehyde (MDA) while inhibiting SOD production. This effect was partially antagonized by NEAT1. We bioinformatically identified interactions between NEAT1/miR‑10b‑5p, BCL6/miR‑10b‑5p, and NLRP3‑promoter/BCL6, and validated them by luciferase assay, qRT‑PCR, and ChIP. NEAT1 inhibited miR‑10b‑5p and upregulated BCL6 by ceRNA mechanism and alleviated OGD/R induced cell damage. We also proved that BCL6 was a repressive transcription factor in the regulation of NLRP3 expression. Thus, lncRNA NEAT1 inhibited inflammasome activation by NLRP3 in microglia via the NEAT1/ miR‑10b‑5p/BCL6/NLRP3 regulatory axis, which alleviated deleterious outcomes of ischemic stroke.",

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‑stimulated BV‑2 microglia cells were treated with apelin‑13. Microglia activation was evaluated by immunofluorescence with F‑actin.

Histone H3 acetyl lysine 9 (H3K9ac) enrichment of TNF‑α and IL‑6 promoter was detected by ChIP. We discovered that apelin‑13 impacted the actin cytoskeleton, recovering the control phenotype following LPS exposure. Apelin‑13 improved autophagy‑mediated microglia polarization towards M2 phenotype to alleviate inflammatory response in LPS‑stimulated cells. Autophagy flux inhibitor chloroquine antagonized these effects of apelin‑13 on LPS‑stimulated cells. Besides, apelin‑13 decreased the enrichment of H3K9ac at the promoter region of TNF‑α and IL‑6 to inhibit inflammatory response, which was reversed by histone deacetylase antagonist valproate. Taken together, apelin‑13 alleviated inflammation via facilitating microglia M2 polarization due to autophagy promotion, and inhibiting H3K9ac enrichment on promoter regions of TNF‑α and IL‑6.",

    "abstract": "Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is an intestinal disease caused by defects in neural crest cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Many reports have proposed that miRNA dysregulation is related to the occurrence of HSCR. However, the roles and mechanisms of miRNAs have not been thoroughly studied. The levels of miR‑92a and KLF4 were examined using qRT‑PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Cell viability, migration and apoptosis were evaluated by MTT, Transwell and flow cytometry assays, respectively. A dual‑luciferase reporter assay was employed to verify the binding relationship between miR‑92a and KLF4. Levels of PI3K/AKT signals were further determined by western blot assay. Herein, elevated expression of miR‑92a and reduced expression of KLF4 were found in HSCR tissues, and their expression patterns were negatively correlated. Overexpression of miR‑92a inhibited cell viability and migration but enhanced cell apoptosis. However, overexpression of KLF4 had the opposite effects. Mechanistically, KLF4 was a target of miR‑92a and it negatively affected biological functions by activating PI3K/AKT signaling. These results proved that miR‑92a inhibited the proliferation and metastasis of nerve cells by regulating the KLF4/PI3K/AKT axis.",

    "abstract": "The Rho kinase inhibitor fasudil exerts neuroprotective effects. We previously showed that fasudil can regulate M1/M2 microglia polarization and inhibit neuroinflammation. Here, the therapeutic effect of fasudil on cerebral ischemia‑reperfusion (I/R) injury was investigated using the middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) model in Sprague‑Dawley rats. The effect of fasudil on the phenotype of microglia and neurotrophic factors in the I/R brain and its potential molecular mechanism was also explored. It was found that fasudil ameliorated neurological deficits, neuronal apoptosis, and inflammatory response in rats with cerebral I/R injury. Fasudil also promoted the polarization of microglia into the M2 phenotype, in turn promoting the secretion of neurotrophic factors. Furthermore, fasudil significantly inhibited the expression of TLR4 and NF‑κB. These findings suggest that fasudil could inhibit the neuroinflammatory response and reduce brain injury after I/R injury by regulating the shift of microglia from an inflammatory M1 phenotype to an anti‑inflammatory M2 phenotype, which may be related to the regulation of the TLR4/ NF‑κB signal pathway.",

    "abstract": "Opioid addiction is critically dependent on the activation of N‑methyl‑D‑aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which are widely found in the mesocorticolimbic system. Meanwhile, opioid addiction may affect the expression level of NMDA receptor subunits. The existence of GluN3 subunits in the NMDA receptor’s tetramer structure reduces the excitatory current of the receptor channel. We evaluated the changes in the mRNA expression pattern of the GluN3B subunit of the NMDA receptor in rat brains following acute and chronic exposure to morphine. Chronic, escalating intraperitoneal doses of morphine or saline were administered twice daily to male Wistar rats for six days. Two other groups were injected with a single acute dose of morphine or saline. The mRNA level of the GluN3B subunit of the NMDA receptor in the striatum, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens (NAc) was measured by real‑time PCR. mRNA expression of the GluN3B subunit was considerably augmented (3.15 fold) in the NAc of animals chronically treated with morphine compared to the control group. The difference between rats that were chronically administered morphine and control rats was not statistically significant for other evaluated brain areas. In rats acutely treated with morphine, no significant differences were found for GluN3B subunit expression in the examined brain regions compared to the control group. It was concluded that chronic exposure to morphine notably increased the GluN3B subunit of the NMDA receptor in NAc. The extent of the impact of this finding on opioid addiction and its features requires further evaluation in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising research tool to address substance abuse, including alcohol, tobacco, opioid, and drug use disorders. The present literature review compared previous studies conducted with various current intensities, application regions, durations of stimulations, and different region targets of the brain. Studies based on the analyses conducted after tDCS administration in substance use disorder were promising for the use of tDCS as adjunctive therapy to reduce visible psychological and neurological symptoms of the addiction. Therefore, we aimed to provide an insight into the current state of research on tDCS as a therapeutic intervention in substance use disorders, identify gaps in the literature, and emphasize future investigation areas. Ultimately, the review sought to contribute to the understanding of the role of tDCS in addressing the complex challenges posed by substance use disorder, and its potential as a complementary or adjunctive treatment modality in addiction care. The present study identified that the left dlPFC and brain regions were effective targets for 1 mA and 2 mA tDCS current density in tobacco/nicotine use disorder. Also, the left dlPFC and 2 mA current density were identified as effective targets for tDCS in alcohol use disorder. Furthermore, left dlPFC and 2 mA current density were identified as effective targets for tDCS in opioid use disorder. Additionally, the right/left dlPFC, orbital frontal cortex, thalamus, and 2 mA current density were identified as effective targets for tDCS in other drug or substance use disorders. Animal studies demonstrated that tDCS was promising in reducing neuropathic pain, modulating neuropeptide Y activity, and reducing the redevelopment of ethanol consumption in animal models. However, further research is required to fully understand the optimal tDCS application parameters.",

Irrespective of substantial differences among the particular members of this group of kinases, their responses to ischemic stress show a lot of similarities. Initially they are switched on by facilitated interaction with their specific activators/second messengers like cyclic AMP, 1,2-sn-diacylglicerol and particularly Ca2+, then they are translocated to highly specific regions of plasma membranes. After phosphorylation of target proteins, the kinases are deactivated by means of different routes. Activity of PKA is regulated by its direct access to cAMP. In the case of CaMKII, it is probably achieved by its extensive, inhibitory autophosphorylations, while PKC seems to be proteolytically degraded. These biphasic changes in serine/threonine kinases activity may play a critical role in the evolution of postischemic brain injury and provide a mechanism for a variety of short- and long-term signalling events.",

The response is determined by stimulus parameters such as its intensity, rise time and duration. The dependence of the ASR on the stimulus duration is more complex than could be assumed from physical properties of acoustic pulse. This effect attracted the attention of few researchers. Some authors reported noticeable changes in the ASR amplitude only for very short (less than 4-6 ms) acoustic pulses. The systematic studies on the effect, however, have not been performed so far. The purpose of this study was to determine to what extent the ASR parameters are affected by the durations of the short stimulus. The amplitude of the acoustic startle reflex was assessed for a fixed tonal frequency (6.9 kHz), and for a variety of stimulus durations ranging between 2 and 10 ms. ASRs were studied in 11 adult, hooded rats exposed to a sequence of tone pulses (110 dB SPL) of different durations, presented in random order, with or without 70 dB white noise as a background. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences between ASR amplitudes for different durations. The startle amplitude increased with acoustic pulse duration and distinguishable differences were seen for stimulus duration between 2 and 8 ms. Further increase of pulse duration had no effect on ASR amplitude. The same pattern of changes was observed when the acoustic stimulus was presented with the white noise. In the tested range of stimulus duration no significant differences in the ASR latency were found. The observed differences may be attributed to changes of stimulus acoustic energy and to physiological characteristic of auditory system in the rat.",

Apoptotic cells in various brain regions were detected by in situ end labelling (TUNEL) and electron microscopy in comparison with neuronal cell loss. The number of labelled cells per brain as very low - from a few labelled cells 6 weeks after inoculation to a maximum of 14 in the terminal stage. The number of neurones counted in 8 selected areas were considerably lower in terminally sick animals (20 and 21 week of incubation period) than in control mice. The mean value of loss of neuronal cells was 32%. The greatest loss (55%) of neurones was noted in the septal nuclei of the paraterminal body and the least lost (16%) in the hypothalamus.

Locomotion was induced by stimulating either the dorsolateral funiculus (DLF) in the cervical spinal cord or the medullary locomotor strip (MLS). At the onset of locomotion, both ventilation and blood pressure were enhanced. During locomotion, the activity of external intercostal muscles decreased but that of the internal intercostal muscles increased. The respiratory pattern changed with the onset of stimulation. The locomotor movements were evoked after a delay. The inspiratory-inhibitory Hering-Breuer reflex was attenuated. Stimulation of the MLS and DLF evoked similar respiratory and circulatory effects. Our data resemble the effects observed during stimulation of the subthalamic or mesencephalic locomotor regions. We conclude that respiratory changes are part of an integrated response involved in the onset of exercise and are independent of the neuronal site where stimulation evoked locomotion. In contrast to previous reports, we suggest that the pattern of interaction among respiratory, circulatory, and locomotor systems does not have to be the specialty of supramedullary structures. Coupling between locomotion and breathing during the post-inspiratory phase suggests that this interaction occurs at the medullary level.",

In the plasma there were cell aggregates characterized by endothelial-like features with fibrils in the cytoplasm, untypical for endothelial cells.

The current and future therapeutic strategies for AD will be discussed. Currently available treatment used in AD is based on acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, since in the course of AD there is a substantial loss in cholinergic neurons. Another registered drug used in more severe AD is NMDA antagonist – memantine. Available strategies for AD include vitamin supplementation for reducing homocysteine levels, statins and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The big hope of the last few years – vitamin E and estrogen supplementation have not been proved efficient, but more studies are needed. There are several strategies aimed at acting directly on Aβ or amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing: vaccination with Aβ peptide, Aβ passive immunization, beta and gamma secretases inhibitors. Nerve growth factors and neurotrophines could also be targeted by new therapies. Conclusions: a better understanding of the role of APP processing and folate and homocysteine in neuronal homeostasis throughout life consist revealing novel and relatively inexpensive approaches for preventing and treating AD.",

    "abstract": "This is a review of our work on multiple microelectrode recordings from the visual cortex of monkeys and subdural recordings from humans - related to the potential underlying neural mechanisms. The former hypothesis of object representation by synchronization in visual cortex (or more generally: of flexible associative processing) has been supported by our recent experiments in monkeys. They demonstrated local synchrony among rhythmic or stochastic γ-activities (30-90 Hz) and perceptual modulation, according to the rules of figure-ground segregation. However, γ-synchrony in primary visual cortex is restricted to few millimeters, challenging the synchronization hypothesis for larger cortical object representations. We found that the spatial restriction is due to γ-waves, traveling in random directions across the object representations. It will be argued that phase continuity of these waves can support the coding of object continuity. Based on models with spiking neurons, potentially underlying neural mechanisms are proposed: (i) Fast inhibitory feedback loops can generate locally synchronized γ-activities; (ii) Hebbian learning of lateral and feed forward connections with distance-dependent delays can explain the stabilization of cortical retinotopy, the limited size of synchronization, the occurrence of γ-waves, and the larger receptive fields at successive levels; (iii) slow inhibitory feedback can support figure-ground segregation; (iv) temporal dispersion in far projections destroys coherence of fast signals but preserves slow amplitude modulations. In conclusion, it is proposed that the hypothesis of flexible associative processing by γ-synchronization, including coherent representations of visual objects, has to be extended to more general forms of signal coupling.",

    "abstract": "The overall goal of all therapeutic interventions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is to: (a) optimize the impaired functions and (b) restore an affordable quality of life for both the patient and his surroundings. AD has been characterized by a significant serotoninergic impairment. It is well known that impaired serotoninergic function is related to aggressive behavior. We, herein, review the past and recent evidence that seems to link the serotoninergic system with aggressive manifestations in AD patients. Managing the aggressive behavior of these patients might be of significant medical, social and economical importance. However, there is still a long way to go until we verify the exact pathophysiological mechanism(s) involved in the induction of aggression in AD patients. The current data underlines a complex relationship between the observed serotoninergic impairment in AD patients and the (a) cholinergic system, (b) the endocrine (hormonal) state, (c) the nutritional habits, (d) the genetic background and (e) the caregiving environment.",

    "abstract": "Protein aggregation and amyloid fibril deposits are characteristic features of more than twenty pathologic conditions characterized by plaque deposition in the central nervous system. Recent studies point out relationships between protein misfolding and numerous serious diseases. Despite different origins (sporadic, familial or transmissible), they are sometimes called conformational diseases to emphasize aberrant conformations as the putative cause of deposits that precede or accompany the clinical manifestation of the disease. Neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Prion disorders (PrD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD) are the most typical examples of protein-based dementias, characterized by protein conformational transitions (α-helix/random coil to β-sheet) that cause aggregation followed by fibrillization. Although it is very tempting to postulate a common mechanism of toxicity based on conformational and structural analogies, it should be noted that the factors responsible for conformational transition, oligomerization, aggregation, and plaque formation, are still subject of speculation and additional data is required to test the amyloid fibril hypothesis.",

The auditory temporal-order threshold, one measure for temporal processing abilities, is defined as the shortest time interval between two acoustic events necessary for a person to be able to identify the correct temporal order. In our study, we examined the reliability of the auditory temporal-order threshold during a one-week period and over a time interval of four months in normally developing children aged 5 to 11 years. The results of our method show that children younger than 7 years have difficulties performing the task successfully. The reliability of the assessment of the temporal-order threshold during a period of one week is only moderate, and its stability over a time interval of four months is low. The results show that auditory-order thresholds in children have to be treated with caution. A high temporal-order threshold does not necessarily predict disabilities in temporal processing.",

However, little is known about the extent to which implanted neuron-like cells can develop into mature neurons and acquire essential properties, and especially formation of synapses with host neurons. In this investigation we seeded PC12 cells labeled with GFP into primary cultured neurons isolated from rat cerebral cortex to build a co-culture system, and then induced the PC12 cells to differentiate into neuron-like cells with NGF. Seven days later, we observed the relationship between the PC12-derived neurons and primary neurons using FM1-43 imaging and immunoelectron microscopy, and found that GFP-labeled neurons could form typical synapses with host primary neurons. These observations showed that immigrant neurons differentiated from PC12 cells could develop into mature neurons and could form intercellular contacts with host neurons. Both the immigrant and host neurons could construct neuronal networks in vitro. The correspondence should be addressed to S. Liu, Email: liusj@nic.bmi.ac.cn",

Spectral analysis of cerebellar activity was obtained by Fast Fourier Transformation. There was a dominance of delta frequency range, while the wide gamma range presented no more than 5% of the total mean power spectra of cerebellar activity before brain injury. A few minutes after brain injury and within the first 90 minutes, there was a decrease of total mean power spectra and a relative decrease of delta range power to about 30%, some increase of beta range, and an increase of gamma range to 20-25%. Relative increase of gamma range in the cerebellar mean power spectra was still present 120 min after the brain injury, while other changes started to diminish. We suggest that spectral changes within slow and fast (gamma) frequency ranges of cerebellar activity may be indicators of the brain state after acute injury.",

    "abstract": "Prion diseases are widely recognized for their transmissibility, and it is this feature that has been studied most extensively. In recent years, public health concerns over the transmission of animal forms of prion disease, such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy and chronic wasting disease, to humans has only augmented the notion that prion diseases are primarily infectious. Yet within the spectrum of human prion diseases, often overlooked is the fact that the overwhelming majority of cases are age-dependent sporadic, or inherited processes. Closer examination of the pathophysiological processes involved in prion disease further indicates a neurodegenerative, rather than infectious disease. Indeed, the age requirement, the numerous kindreds carrying point mutations in an amyloidogenic protein, the copper binding properties of the amyloidogenic protein, the evidence of free radical damage, the presence of polymorphisms that influence disease susceptibility, the formation of amyloid plaques, and in some cases the presence of neurofibrillary pathology, are features common to both prion disease and Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, while transmissibility will continue to be a major subject of prion disease research, we suspect that further characterization of its pathophysiological mechanisms will only substantiate the notion that prion disease is fundamentally a neurodegenerative process.",

Dendritic spines are the most labile elements of synaptic circuitry and the most likely substrate of experience-dependent alterations in neuronal circuits in cerebral cortex. We characterized morphologically and numerically a specific population of spines, i.e. double synapse spines, which have two different inputs--one excitatory and the other inhibitory, in the B2 barrel of mouse somatosensory cortex. We also described changes in morphology of double synapse spines induced by classical conditioning in which stimulation of vibrissae was paired with a tail shock. The analysis was carried out by means of serial EM micrograph reconstruction. We showed that double spines account for about 10% of all analyzed spines. The morphology of a typical double synapse spine is similar to the morphology of single synapse spine and both consist of two parts--a large head and a narrow, long neck. Excitatory synapses are preferentially located on the head of double synapse spines and inhibitory synapses are usually located on the neck of these spines. The length of the double synapse spine neck decreases and the cross-section area of the spine neck increases significantly as a result of sensory conditioning.",

The introduction of novelty took place after 11 habituation sessions. In Experiment II in the course of habituation sessions the experimental group of rats was subjected to a persistent change of tunnel arrangement in the experimental zone, whereas for the control group nothing changed. All animals reacted to the novelty with increased time spent in the experimental zone and decreased time spent in other zones. Both experiments show that under low stress conditions rats demonstrate a positive response toward novelty and that their previous experience with novelty does not affect that reaction.",

Theta relevant intra-PPN circuitry involves its cholinergic, GABA-ergic and glutamatergic neurons and Substance P as neuromodulator. Evidence that PPN opioid elements also modulate the hippocampal theta is provided here. In urethane-anesthetized rats a unilateral microinjection of morphine (MF) (1.5 and 5 µg) increased the maximal peak power of tail pinch-induced theta. The higher dose also increased the corresponding frequency. When the theta was evoked by intra-PPN injection of carbachol (10 µg), the addition of MF (5 µg) prolonged theta latency and shortened the duration of the theta. These effects of MF were blocked by naloxone (5 µg). The results obtained suggest that the PPN opioid system can enhance or suppress the hippocampal theta depending on the actual level of PPN activation.",

    "abstract": "The present study tested a hypothesis, whether plant-derived genistein influences the secretion of growth hormone (GH) in ewes, acting directly within the central nervous system (CNS). Starting six weeks after ovariectomy, ewes were infused intracerebroventricularly with genistein (n = 5) or 17beta-estradiol (n = 5), both in a total dose of 40 microg/400 microl/4 h, or with a vehicle (control, n = 5). All infusions were performed from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM and blood samples were collected from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM at 10-min intervals. Five genistein- and three vehicle-infused ewes were slaughtered the following morning. The plasma GH concentration was assayed by the radioimmunoassay method, and immunoreactivity of GH in the adenohypophysis was determined by immunohistochemistry. In genistein-infused ewes, mean plasma GH concentration was significantly higher during the whole period of infusion than the concomitant concentration in vehicle-infused ewes. However, examining data within group, GH secretion rose gradually, reaching a significant value during the second phase of genistein infusion. In 17beta-estradiol-infused animals, a significant increase in GH concentration was noted during the first two hours of the infusion, in comparison with vehicle-infused and also in comparison with genistein-infused ewes. Although a gradual increase in basic GH secretion continued in all treated groups during the afternoon and evening, mean plasma GH concentrations in genistein- and 17beta-estradiol-infused ewes were still significantly higher than in the vehicle-infused. The percentage of GH-positive cells in the adenohypophysis and the density of immunoreactive material in these cells decreased significantly in genistein-infused ewes, compared to the control, indicating diminished hormone storage. In conclusion, genistein as 17beta-estradiol, is an effective stimulator of GH secretion in ewes and may exert its effect at the level of the CNS.",

To analyze relationship between expression of GnRH and GnRH-R genes with LH secretion the blood samples were collected at 10 min intervals to determine LH levels in control and stressed animals. The concentration of GnRH mRNA increased significantly in the preoptic area, anterior and ventromedial hypothalamus of ewes subjected to short stress. The prolonged stressful stimuli significantly decreased GnRH mRNA levels in all analyzed structures. In short stressed ewes the significant augmentation of mRNA encoding GnRH-R was detected in the preoptic area, entire hypothalamus, stalk/median eminence and anterior pituitary gland. The GnRH-R mRNA was significantly reduced in all tested structures of animals subjected to prolonged footshocking except for the preoptic area, where GnRH-R mRNA did not differ from control values. The changes in GnRH mRNA and GnRH-R mRNA levels under short or prolonged stress were associated with an increase or decrease of LH concentration in blood plasma, suggesting the existence of a direct relationship between GnRH mRNA and GnRH-R mRNA expression with LH secretion. The results indicate that the expression of both GnRH gene and GnRH-R gene, as well as LH secretion in ewes during the follicular phase of the estrous cycle, are dependent upon the kind of stress.

    "abstract": "Injury to the mature central nervous system (CNS) induces a series of transient changes leading not only to death of neurons, but also to spontaneous rearrangement of the affected network. One of such pro plastic events, detected following injury, is an increased level of neurotrophins. Neurotrophins are a family of proteins involved in survival and outgrowth processes. The other one, more difficult to observe, is a change in the complexity of the dendritic tree, causing arborization or pruning, depending on many circumstances: i.e. lesion etiology. Subsequent therapies like enriched environment or locomotor exercise bring about a functional improvement, which was found to further increase the neurotrophin level and induced additional arborization of dendrites. Another important consequence of damage to CNS connections is deafferentation, shown to induce a down regulation of outgrowth inhibitors. Their suppression in turn may facilitate dendritic plasticity. Taken together, these factors may contribute to enhanced plasticity in the injured mature CNS. Thus the proper use of endogenously increased plastic potential seems to be important for design and optimizing therapeutic strategies. Further investigation of mechanisms involved in switching on plasticity may help to improve on existing therapies and find new ways to obtain better recovery following injury.",

WAG/Rij rats had less approaches to the pups and higher latencies of approaching them compared to Wistar, while locomotion showed a different pattern over days. This confirms the hypothesis that animals with absence epilepsy show more poor maternal behavior and that these effects cannot be solely attributed to differences in locomotor activity.

    "abstract": "Voltage-gated sodium channels are critical for the initiation and propagation of action potentials and for the regulation of neuronal excitability. Hyperglycemia and hypoxia are two main changes in diabetes frequently associated with several complications. Although many studies on streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats indicate that early diabetic neuropathy is associated with increased amplitude and faster kinetics of sodium channels, the distinctive roles of high glucose and hypoxia have not been completely clarified. Here we show that hypoxic and high glucose conditions (overnight exposure) increase activation and inactivation of TTX-RINa in DRG neurons without affecting the level of expression. Hypoxia and high glucose alone were potent enough to induce similar or even greater sensitization than when both conditions were present, without any of them having a predominant effect. PKA is mainly responsible of the one condition effect, while under both hypoxia and high glucose PKC was also contributing to alter the kinetics, although not in a cumulative manner. These data indicate that TTX-RINa is significantly modulated under short-time exposure to hypoxia and high glucose, a mechanism which might be relevant for diabetes-related complications or other diseases associated with acute hypoxia.",

In the present study, the influence of the small molecules representing epigenetic modulators (histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A and DNA methyltransferase inhibitor RG-108) on the process of reverting neural progenitors from HUCB-NSC (Human Umbilical Cord Blood Neural Stem Cell) line to the pluripotent state was tested. The experiments were conducted in low oxygen tension, in three different experimental layouts: (1) in the presence of reprogramming/recombinant polyarginine–tailed proteins; (2) with recombinant proteins and small molecules; (3) only in the presence of small molecules. We wanted to find out, whether it will be possible to induce pluripotent state of neural stem cells only by epigenetic modulators. Our results revealed that the inhibitors of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation used along with 5 percent oxygen tension can only transiently induce or elevate some pluripotency genes in neural progenitors with different pattern, but were not sufficient for stable reprogramming. The iPS cells from neural progenitor cells of HUCBNSC were obtained only when TSA, RG-108 and reprogramming proteins have been applied simultaneously. These cells were tested for the expression of the selected pluripotency genes and in functional assays to prove their pluripotency stage. The obtained data show that the small molecules in conjunction with reprogramming factors are the potent tools in cell reprogramming.",

    "abstract": "Using stem cells (SC) in new strategies for clinical treatment requires control of stem cell fate decision and the ability to govern their patterning and commitment in tissue engineering. Neural stem cells and other adult SC can respond to the different components of the microenvironment and their spatial arrangement in the stem cell niche. It has been shown previously by our group that different composition and architecture of patterned bioactive domains influence the developmental response of neural stem cells. In the present report we verify the commitment and differentiation of neural stem cells derived from human cord blood (HUCB-NSC) by a single cell patterning system. Microcontact printing technology was used to generate single cell positioning areas of different geometry: 10 micrometer-thin lines and 10 micrometer-width one cell posts. The commitment and differentiation of HUCB-NSC cells cultured on different surfaces were dependent on the geometry and the type of biomaterial present in bioactive domains. Fibronectin promoted neuronal protrusion outgrowth (Beta-tubulin III and MAP-2 positive cells) and gap junction development (Cx43 marker) between cells growing on lines while poly-L-lysine promoted HUCB-NSC differentiation into astrocytic, glial fibrillary acidic protein expressing (GFAP positive) cell phenotype. Here we also demonstrate by scanning electron microscopy that morphology of cells on the patterned surface is highly dependent upon the type of biomolecules used for printing. These kinds of platforms can be used for investigating the influence of spatial organization of environment on the SC fate decision and for studying the molecular processes occurring in a single cell.",

    "abstract": "Many types of neural progenitors from various sources have been evaluated for therapy of CNS disorders. Prerequisite for success in cell therapy is the ability for transplanted cells to reach appropriate target such as stroke lesion. We have established neural stem cell line from human umbilical cord blood neural stem (HUCB-NSC). In the present study we evaluated migratory capabilities of cells (HUCB-NSC) and the presence of various migration-related receptors. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed abundant expression of CXCR4, PDGFR-alpha, PDGFR-beta, c-Met, VEGFR, IGF-1R and PSA-NCAM receptors in non-adherent population of HUCB-NSC cultured in serum free (SF) conditions (SF cells). Biological activity of selected receptors was confirmed by HUCB-NSC in vitro migration towards SDF-1 and IGF-1 ligands. Additionally, rat brain-derived homogenates have been assessed for their chemoattractive activity of HUCB-NSC. Our experiments unveiled that brain tissue was more attracted for HUCB-NSC than single ligands with higher potency of injured than intact brain. Moreover, adherent HUCB-NSC cultured in low serum (LS) conditions (LS cells) were employed to investigate an impact of different extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins on cell motility. It turned out that laminin provided most permissive microenvironment for cell migration, followed by fibronectin and gelatin. Unexpected nuclear localization of CXCR4 in SF cells prompted us to characterize intracellular pattern of this expression in relation to developmental stage of cells cultured in different conditions. Continuous culture of LS cells revealed cytoplasmatic pattern of CXCR4 expression while HUCB-NSC cultured in high serum conditions (HS cells) resulted in gradual translocation of CXCR4 from nucleus to cytoplasm and then to arising processes. Terminal differentiation of HUCB-NSC was followed by CXCR4 expression decline.",

    "abstract": "In the present study developmental changes in the cerebral sulci and volumes of subcortical and archicortical structures of the cerebrum in cynomolgus monkey fetuses were examined with T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images in 3D. On the embryonic day (ED) 90, the lateral ventricle had still an immature vesicular shape in the occipital region of the cerebrum, and it dramatically closed its lumen by ED 100. In that period the calcarine sulcus progressively infolded from the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere narrowing the lumen of the lateral ventricle in the occipital region. Volume of the lateral ventricle decreased in the period ED 90-100, increasing afterwards in spite of increasing volumes of subcortical and archicortical structures such as the caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, amygdala and hippocampal formation. During the same time, the volume of the germinal matrix around lateral ventricles decreased to disappear completely by ED 120. These results suggest that the morphological maturation of lateral ventricle is linked to the development of calcarine sulcus in cynomolgus monkey fetuses. The degree of infolding of calcarine sulcus on ED 100 would be useful as a gross anatomical landmark for evaluating the cerebral maturation in cynomolgus monkey fetuses.",

    "abstract": "Salsolinol with its derivatives has been considered as a potential neurotoxin for the dopaminergic system in the human and rat brain. Investigating a sheep model for studies on the action of salsolinol within the central nervous system we examined whether this compound is able to affect the hypothalamic neuroendocrine dopaminergic (NEDA) system during its high seasonal activity, when sheep entered to anestrus under the long day conditions. Therefore, salsolinol was infused into the third ventricle of the brain in combination with the in vivo push-pull perfusion of the mediobasal hypothalamus/median eminence (MBH/ME). The effects of this drug on either perfusate noradrenaline (NA) or plasma prolactin concentration were also studied. The infusion of salsolinol resulted in rapid and permanent diminution in dopamine (DA) release into the extracellular spaces of the MBH/ME up to an undetectable level and in the 57% decrease in DA metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid concentration, compared to the control. This effect of salsolinol was accompanied by the significant enhancement of the pituitary prolactin release into circulation. The concentration of other DA metabolite, homovanillic acid, as well as NA in the MBH/ME was not affected. Thus, our results in the anestrous sheep underline the role played by salsolinol as a neuromodulator for the hypothalamic NEDA system and as a signal transmitter for the pituitary prolactin release. We suggest that the hypothalamic NEDA system of anestrous sheep during its high secretory activity may be set as a model for studies on the salsolinol-dopamine relationship.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegeneration is often accompanied by protein inclusions which may interfere with cell physiology. On the other hand, alteration in intracellular trafficking may precede impairment of neurotransmission and therefore trigger cell death. In view of this, it is hypothesized that changes in mitochondrial traffic may occur before neurodegeneration triggered by rotenone exposure and could favor this process. The effects of low concentrations of rotenone on the expression of dynein c1h1, dynactin and syntaphilin, which are proteins related to mitochondria transport and anchoring, were evaluated in cell cultures of substantia nigra, locus coeruleus and hippocampus as well as in these same brain areas in Lewis aged rats. The results indicate that low concentrations of rotenone decrease dynein c1h1 protein levels in cell cultures and brain areas of aged rats. Dynactin is decreased after exposure to 0.1 and 0.3 nM of rotenone, and increased after exposure to 0.5 nM of rotenone in cell cultures. Aged rats present increased dynactin expression. Syntaphilin expression decreased in vitro and increased in vivo after rotenone exposure. These findings suggest that changes in protein expression related to mitochondrial retrograde transport and anchoring occur before neurodegeneration induced by rotenone exposure, which may be a primary factor to trigger neurodegenerative mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Over 20 years ago, the Sadowski group separated two mouse lines, one with high (HA) and the other with low (LA) sensitivity to swim stress-induced analgesia (SSIA). Recently, we proposed that increased leakage of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in the HA line created the difference in the response to SSIA. To search for further evidence for this hypothesis, differences in the levels of the BBB proteins occludin and claudin-5 were analysed. In addition, we sought to evaluate practical differences in BBB permeability by examining the antinociceptive levels in HA and LA mouse lines after IV administration of peptides that have limited access to the CNS. Western blot was used to analyse the differences between occludin and claudin-5. To evaluate the functional differences between the BBB of HA and LA mice, the antinociception levels of endomorphin I, biphalin and AA2016 (peptides with limited BBB permeabilities) in the tail flick test were examined. The expression levels of occludin and claudin-5 in the HA mouse line were lower than in the LA and control mice. Central antinociception of the opioid peptides were significantly higher in the HA line than in the LA and control lines. Our data support the hypothesis that BBB leakage is responsible for the differences between the HA and LA mouse lines. Although SSIA confirmed BBB differences between both lines, it is not limited to the opioid system and could be a useful model for studying the role of the BBB in molecular communications between the periphery and CNS.",

The goldfish is a widely used animal model in neuroanatomical, neurophysiological, and behavioral research. The purpose of this study was to examine pallial and subpallial cholinoceptive, cholinergic and nitrergic populations in the goldfish telencephalon by means of histochemical and immunohistochemical techniques in order to identify neurons containing acetylcholinesterase (AChE), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), NADPH-diaphorase (NADPHd), and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and to relate their distribution to their putative functional significance. Regions containing AChE-labeled neurons represented terminal fields of cholinergic inputs as well as a widespread distribution of AChE-related enzymes; these regions also usually contained NADPHd-labeled neurons and often contained small numbers of nNOS-positive cells. However, the ventral subdivisions of the medial and lateral parts of the dorsal telencephalic area, and the ventral and lateral parts of the ventral telencephalic area, were devoid of nNOS-labeled cells. ChAT-positive neurons were found only in the lateral part of the ventral telencephalic area. ChAT- and nNOS-positive fibers exhibited a radial orientation, and were seen as thin axons with en-passant boutons. The distribution of these elements could help to elucidate the role of cholinergic and nitrergic neuronal networks in the goldfish telencephalon.",

Bilateral carotid artery occlusion (BCAO) was performed in rats in WMD and GM1 groups, while in sham group; the rat bilateral carotid arteries were merely exposed without occlusion.

    "abstract": "Respiratory disturbances accompany Parkinson’s disease. Weakness of the respiratory muscles or lowering of central respiratory drive might be responsible for respiratory disability. Striatal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) simulates motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease in the rat. Present study investigated whether unilateral infusion of 6-OHDA into the striatum may evoke respiratory disorders and therefore be a model for the study of the respiratory aspects of Parkinson’s disease. Two weeks after the infusion the animals were anesthetized, vagotomized, paralyzed and artificially ventilated. Neural respiratory activity in the vehicle and 6-OHDA treated groups of animals was assessed from the peak amplitude of the phrenic and hypoglossal bursts, frequency of bursts and minute activity during baseline ventilation and acute intermittent hypoxia composed of five 1.5 minute long episodes of 11 percent oxygen introduced every 3 minutes. An impairment of dopaminergic pathways by 6-OHDA evoked separate effects on phrenic and hypoglossal activity. Under baseline conditions the respiratory parameters taken from the integrated phrenic nerve activity unchanged, while the preinspiratory part of the hypoglossal activity (pre-I HG) was reduced both in terms of its onset and amplitude. 6-OHDA did not affect the phrenic response to acute intermittent hypoxia but it increased the hypoglossal response (Fig. 2). Hypoxia activated the pre-I HG in both experimental groups. Although the pre-I HG increased strongly during hypoxic stimulation, the ratio of the pre-inspiratory hypoglossal amplitude to the inspiratory hypoglossal amplitude never achieved similar values as in the sham group. This ratio decreased significantly during secondary decline of the hypoxic respiratory response. A decline of the hypoxic response was more intense in the hypoglossal activity than in the phrenic activity and moved into hypoxic apnoea more frequently in the Parkinson’s disease model. The results indicate a differential modulation of the phrenic and hypoglossal neural output with increased chemical drive when dopaminergic pathways were impaired by 6-OHDA suggesting that such a mechanism may contribute to respiratory insufficiency in Parkinson’s disease. An involvement of a modified mechanism of dopamine efflux and of serotonin and orexin during hypoxia is suggested in the observed changes in the hypoglossal activity in the 6-OHDA model of PD.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether hypoxic preconditioning of mice can also induce antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects that are detectable with the other commonly used behavioral tests, and to determine whether these effects are accompanied by an increase in neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the hippocampus, which may suggest the involvement of NPY in these mechanisms. The intermittent mild hypobaric hypoxia was generated by 2-h exposure of mice to 0.47 atm for 3 consecutive days. In the tail suspension test a significant decrease in the duration of immobility was observed 24 h, but not 48 h after the last hypobaric session. The elevated plus maze trials performed 48 h after preconditioning showed a significant increase in the frequency of open arm entries, a reduction in the duration of closed arm occupancy and substantially more time spent in the open arms in comparison to the control groups. The open field test demonstrated the absence of increases in general activity or unspecific exploratory behavior in hypoxia-preconditioned mice. The EIA test detected a statistically significant but relatively weak increase in the NPY content in the hippocampus 24 h after preconditioning. Together, our data demonstrate that preconditioning of mice with intermittent mild hypobaric hypoxia induces anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects.

    "abstract": "Depression is a chronic illness of unknown etiology. Trace elements, such as copper and zinc, and defense antioxidants, such as catalase, are important factors that determine the clinical course of brain diseases. Furthermore, altered glucose metabolism in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex has been associated with depression. Identifying factors that can precipitate depressive-like behavior is of particular importance as it can direct clinicians towards the etiology of the disease. In this study, 16 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups: socialized and socially isolated. After one week of acclimatization, animals were housed in isolation for 14 days. Rats in the social group were socialized together for 14 days. On day 15, the forced swim test was performed and blood sugar was analyzed. The brain was removed immediately for biochemical analysis. Socially isolated rats showed more pronounced depressive-like behavior in the forced swim test than socialized rats. Moreover, socially isolated rats demonstrated significantly lower copper and zinc concentrations, as well as a marked reduction in catalase activity, in both prefrontal cortex and hippocampus compared to socialized rats. Additionally, blood sugar levels were higher in socially isolated animals. Isolation causes reduction in copper and zinc levels and catalase activity, which may precipitate depressive-like behavior in these animals.",

Wild type (WT) and IL-6 deficient mice of both sexes, young and aging, were housed individually and various types of their activity were recorded and analyzed with the Phenorack system in their home cages during 72 hours-long sessions. All investigated groups of mice were active mainly during the dark phase of the 24-hours cycle. Generally, the IL-6 deficient animals were more active than their WT controls and females of both genotypes more active than males. Aging mice were less active than the sex and genotype-matched young animals. The independent variables (age, sex and genotype) strongly interacted, which suggests that the modulatory influence of IL-6 on mice behavior may be different in males and females and that it chan ges during aging. We conclude that under normal physiological conditions signaling of IL-6 via its receptor participates In modulation of the basic pattern of activity. This modulation differs in males and females and changes with aging.",

This study evaluates the neuroprotective effect of Achillea millefolium (Ach) on chronic morphine‑induced learning and memory impairment, oxidative stress, and neuronal apoptosis in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus. Thirty‑two male Wistar rat rats were classified into four treatment groups (n=8). Morphine sulfate was administered chronically. The treatment groups were given Ach aqueous extract (100, 250, and 500 mg/kg), orally, each day. After 28 days, the Morris water maze test was performed on all subjects. Caspase‑3, Bax, and Bcl‑2 proteins expression in the CA1 region of hippocampal tissue was analyzed using the western blot method. Also, malondialdehyde concentration, glutathione peroxidase activity, and superoxide dismutase activity were evaluated. The results indicated that Ach extract can improve spatial learning and memory defects in morphine‑treated rats. Ach administration also ameliorated apoptosis and oxidative stress indicator levels in hippocampal CA1 of morphine‑treated animals. Based on the present study, Ach improved spatial learning and memory defects, and reduced oxidative stress and apoptosis in the hippocampus CA1 region, in chronic morphine‑treated animals.",

Over the years, based on theoretical considerations, the concepts of sensory processing disorder and sensory processing sensitivity were formulated. The article highlights the role of temperament and its impact on sensory processing, suggesting that individual differences can significantly affect how people respond to sensory stimuli. The neurophysiological basis including sensory gating, electrodermal responses, and neuroimaging methods is presented. There has been an interest in the relationship between SP and mental disorders in adults, despite the lack of a formal diagnosis in DSM‑5 and ICD classifications.

As neurocognitive disorders progress, different types of aphasia may present. To evaluate the disease‑related changes of language functions, and to determine the correlation between the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and language dyfunctions in patients with DAT or the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) or semantic dementia (SD), we used a scale for speech and reading impairment in Japanese (the Standard Language Test for Aphasia [SLTA]), and perfusion single photon emission computed tomography, and we analyzed the relationships among them. Significant differences were identified among the DAT, SD, and bvFTD groups in the SLTA subscales concerning kanji (morphographic) words. There were positive correlations between the SLTA subscales concerning kanji words and the rCBF in left temporo‑occipital regions. The patients with bvFTD showed relative rCBF preservation in the posterior cerebrum compared with the DAT and SD patients. Our results indicate that aphasia for Japanese kanji words might be related to the dysfunction of temporo‑occipital regions, and they suggest that in patients with bvFTD, preserving the CBF in the posterior cerebrum might help maintain the ability to handle morphographic words such as kanji.",

    "abstract": "Numerous experimental data point to therapeutic effects of electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves. Stimulation of low‑threshold proprioceptive afferents to motoneurons (MNs) innervating the ankle extensor muscles of the rat increases glutamatergic Ia MN inputs and spinal and muscle expression of neurotrophin‑3, instrumental for proprioceptive afferent‑MN connections. We aimed to examine morphological consequences of the cuff electrode implanted around the tibial nerve used for chronic stimulation which may cause unwanted effects through its long‑lasting contact with the nerve. We addressed also the questions if stimulation of low‑threshold proprioceptive afferents may contribute to neural damage, affect capillary vessels and macrophage morphology reflecting functional state of the nerve. Their consequences on axonal and nerve ultrastructure have not been previously evaluated. To examine the effect of cuff electrodes and of 7‑day low‑threshold stimulation applied in the 4th week post‑implantation on the tibial nerve, electrodes were implanted bilaterally, and a stimulation was added unilaterally. Non‑implanted group was the control. The counts of myelinated axons, their cross‑sectional area (>1 μm2) and circularity were measured on photomicrographs captured with use of light microscope from semi‑thin Epon sections stained with toluidine blue. Ultrastructural observations with TEM included myelin, axoplasm, Remak fibers, blood vessels, macrophages and fibroblasts. Four weeks after implantation of the cuff, the mean cross‑sectional area of the nerve, and counts, area and diameter of the myelinated fibers were lower compared to control. The largest fibers located in the external parts of the main nerve branches and dispersed in small branches were changed the most. No significant difference in either parameter between unstimulated (NS) and stimulated (S) nerve was found. Axons in Remak bundles were dispersed comparably in NS and S nerves. Thinly myelinated fibers demonstrating features of demyelination with remyelination were identified. We provide evidence that long-lasting presence of the cuff electrode is not neutral for nerve structure, causing mild shrinkage of large myelinated axons and impairment of organization of unmyelinated fibers. Since we demonstrated that low‑threshold proprioceptive stimulation of the tibial nerve results in a stable Hoffmann reflex and induces synaptic plasticity by increasing glutamatergic input to MNs, we conclude that the applied protocol maintains an adequate margin of safety.",

The study aimed to investigate the effects of the combined administration of caffeine and heavy metal compounds (cadmium chloride and lead acetate) on brain tissue function, focusing on memory processes and oxidative stress parameters. Adult male Swiss mice were administered substances intraperitoneally for 10 days. A passive avoidance test evaluated long‑term memory, while the Y‑maze assessed spatial working memory. In addition, lipid peroxidation and glutathione levels, as well as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and acetylcholinesterase activity, were determined in mouse brains. The results showed that exposure to caffeine and cadmium or lead caused different neurotoxic effects. Unlike lead, cadmium interacted with caffeine in memory tests. Caffeine protected mice against cadmium‑induced spatial working memory impairment. The combination of caffeine and cadmium impaired learning in the passive avoidance test. Cadmium and lead caused oxidative stress in the brain, and caffeine had a preventive effect against it. The study showed that co‑exposure to caffeine and cadmium could affect learning and memory. The antioxidant activity of caffeine may play a protective role in cadmium‑induced spatial memory impairment.",

Status epilepticus was induced via intraperitoneal (IP) injection of LiCl (3 mmol/kg) 24 hours before an injection of pilocarpine (40 mg/kg, IP). Motor seizures were suppressed by paraldehyde (0.3‑0.6 ml/kg, IP) two hours after status epilepticus onset. Animals were anesthetized using urethane and perfused with phosphate‑buffered saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were sectioned and Nissl stained for map guidance, with fluoro‑Jade B fluorescence used to detect degenerated neurons. Fluoro‑jade B‑positive neurons were plotted to a standard stereotaxic atlas, their distribution was quantified, and their long‑axis diameter was measured. Fluoro‑jade B‑positive neurons were found in pups aged 15 days and older 24 hours after status epilepticus, in which their numbers increased, and their perikaryon size decreased with advancing age. Thus, neuronal damage severity was dependent on age and survival interval. Neuronal damage was only found in the rostral sector of the zona incerta, a region that exhibits a small number of inhibitory neurons and is reciprocally connected to the limbic cortex. This system of hyperactivity, coupled with inhibitory neurons, may be the underlying cause of the neuronal degeneration and explain why it was confined to the rostral sector of the zona incerta.",

This study aimed to determine the expression of miRNAs in FCD and correlate their expression level with mRNA levels of GABAA receptor subunits. Expression of GABAA receptor subunits (α1 and α4) and miRNAs (miR‑155‑5p, miR‑186‑5p, and miR‑24‑3p) were evaluated using real‑time PCR in resected brain samples from FCD patients. miRNA levels were also determined in the serum of FCD patients. Spontaneous GABAA receptor‑mediated synaptic activity was measured using patch clamp technique. Significant increase in α1 and α4 subunit expression and miR‑155‑5p levels, while decrease in miR‑24‑3p and miR‑186‑5p levels, was observed in the brain samples of FCD. In the serum of FCD patients, miR‑155‑5p levels were increased, whereas miR‑24‑3p and miR‑186‑5p levels remained unaltered. Increased α4 subunit expression in FCD might be due to reduced levels of miR‑24‑3p and miR‑186‑5p. In addition, reduced miR‑186‑5p levels might be responsible for increased expression of α1 subunit. We also observed an increase in the spontaneous GABAA receptor‑mediated synaptic transmission in FCD. In conclusion, dysregulation of miRNAs and GABAA receptor expression suggest that these miRNAs may contribute to altered GABAA receptor‑mediated synaptic activity in FCD.",

All animals, except the CON group, received random mild stressors for 21 days, and from day 22‑42, the treatments were administered alongside the stressors. Behavioral assessments were performed on day 42, followed by sample collection. Brain homogenates from CUMS‑exposed animals expressed elevated levels of the pro‑inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)‑1β, IL‑6 and tumor necrosis factor‑alpha (TNF‑α), and oxidative stress markers.

Fifteen dyslexics adults and 15 age‑matched non‑dyslexics participated in the study. Posturography data were collected in two sessions: during quiet standing (single‑task) and while performing a mental task while standing on the platform (dual‑task). Each session was conducted under three distinct visual conditions: monocular fixation, binocular fixation, and eyes closed. Four parameters of the center of pressure (CoP) signal were analysed: medio‑lateral sway (XSD), antero‑posterior sway (YSD), sway area (Area95) and mean CoP velocity (Vavg). A psycho‑physical tests with Wesson card and a modified Mallett test were used to measure fixation disparity (FD). Slight underconvergence at the fixation point results in exo‑FD, and conversely, overconvergence results in eso‑FD. The results indicated that in dyslexics, the exo‑FD values were higher than in controls. In both groups, body stabilization was better with binocular fixation compared to eyes closed (lowest value of Vavg and CoP sway). Moreover, dyslexic adults demonstrated impaired body balance. The posturographic deficits remained unaltered by the viewing conditions, indicating that binocular fixation did not contribute to body instability, despite the higher incidence of fixation disparity in the dyslexic group. The existence of both posturographic deficits and the presence of FD may reflect deficits at the cerebellar level.",

Behavioral assessments included the open field test, elevated plus maze test, and hyperexcitability test. Seizure susceptibility was evaluated using the PTZ challenge and PTZ kindling models. A decreased Mbd3 level significantly increased latency to seizure onset in the PTZ challenge, indicating a raised seizure threshold. Rats with reduced Mbd3 expression also exhibited increased anxiety‑like behavior in the open‑field test. Mbd3 downregulation did not affect the progression of epileptogenesis in the PTZ kindling model.

    "abstract": "During luteolysis in sheep, episodic pulses of oxytocin (OT), contributed by the neurohypophysis and the corpus luteum (CL), stimulate uterine luteolytic pulses of prostaglandin (PG) F2 alpha via endometrial OT receptors. To distinguish relative contributions of neurohypophysial and luteal OT, ovariectomized sheep were given estradiol-17 beta (E) and progesterone (P) to stimulate levels during the cycle. In intact sheep, luteectomy was performed to exclude the CL as a source of OT and to initiate P withdrawal. In ovariectomized sheep, E (1 microgram/h) for 12 to 36 h) superimposed on basal E(0.05 microgram/h), caused a series of 4 to 6 episodes of high frequency pulses of OT, each episode lasting 1 to 2 h at intervals of 3 h, and commencing at 24 h. Withdrawal of P (500 micrograms/h), superimposed on basal E in ovariectomized sheep, or luteectomy in intact sheep, evoked similar episodes of high frequency pulses of OT beginning at 24 h. We conclude that (1) an increase in E levels, or the return of E action following P withdrawal, causes intermittent increases in the frequency of the central OT pulse generator. (2) high frequency pulses of OT initiate subluteolytic levels of uterine PGF2 alpha which trigger a supplemental release of luteal OT; (3) luteal OT amplifies the secretion of uterine PGF2 alpha which initiates luteolysis and causes more luteal OT to be secreted; and (4) in addition to the established hypothalamic-anterior pituitary-gonadal axis for initiating the ovarian cycle (via the gonadotrophins), there is now evidence for a hypothalamic-posterior pituitary-gonadal axis for terminating the ovarian cycle (via OT).",

The forward conditioned stimulus elicited suppression of bar presses, indicating acquisition of fear. The backward stimulus paired with identical shock elicited behaviour typical for rats in a condition of safety and caused an increase of bar press rate. Enhancement of bar presses acquired in the course of backward conditioning was stable, immune to influences from unsignalled shocks presented in the same experimental context, and resistant to extinction when all shocks were discontinued. Properties of the employed variety of the backward conditioning procedure are discussed. When a brief shock overshadowed the onset of a backward stimulus, the remaining portion of the stimulus became a signal of safety.",

Typical bonds cleaved by PCs include the pairs Lys-Arg, Arg-Arg and Arg-X-Lys/Arg-Arg. These cleavage sites have been detected following coexpression of each convertase in cell lines together with different precursors as models, including proopiomelanocortin (POMC), proinsulin and proNGF and proBDNF. The presence of PCs and different precursors was revealed by in situ hybridization or immunocytochemistry in cultured AtT-20 cells, in the developing CNS, pituitary, and pancreatic islets. In an experimental model of epilepsy in which epileptiform activities were provoked by kainic acid administration, we observed a similar transient expression of furin and PC1 as compared to that of NGF and BDNF. In conclusion, it is proposed that under different stimuli various precursors are activated by a unique cocktail of convertases, each of which either alone or in combination with others acts to process inactive precursors, and thereby playing an important role in development and in the plasticity of the neuronal system.",

    "abstract": "A significant component of the aging process is genetically determined. Numerous theories of aging exist, many of which postulate the existence of \"longevity genes.\" Recent advances in molecular biological and other techniques have allowed a significantly greater understanding of aging and age-related disease. This will be illustrated by four genetic and sporadic diseases: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related disorders, transthyretin dementia, cerebral amyloid angiopathy-Icelandic type and scrapie related diseases. Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common of this group, is the leading cause of dementia in Western countries. Recent genetic and biochemical studies have shown the involvement of at least four genes in the pathogenesis of AD. In early-onset familial AD mutations in the beta PP, S182 (presenilin 1) and STM2 (presenilin 2 or E5-1) genes have been found, while in the more common late-onset AD the presence of the apolipoprotein E4 isotype is a major risk factor. Genetic studies have also helped to elucidate the etiology of rarer cerebral amyloidoses such as the recently described Hungarian amyloidosis that is characterized by meningocerebrovascular amyloid deposition, with resultant dementia. This disease is linked to a mutation in the transthyretin gene. It is hoped that in the near future this increase in knowledge will allow the development of therapeutic approaches to slow the aging process.",

Furthermore, physiological studies showed that the metabolism of adipose tissue is controlled by the adrenergic component of the nervous system. However, nothing is known on the sources of innervation of different fat tissue depots. Therefore, we decided to study the distribution of ganglionic sympathetic neurons innervating adipose tissue in the pig by means of a retrograde tracing method. We used 9 male and 9 female pigs of approximately 50 kg body weight. The retrograde tracer, Fast Blue (FB), was injected into the subcutaneous, perirenal and mesentery fat tissue depots. Results of the present study showed that numerous centers of the sympathetic nervous system innervate adipose tissue in the pig. FB+ neurons projecting to the subcutaneous fat tissue were placed in the thoraco-lumbar region of the sympathetic chain ganglia (SChG). However, neurons supplying perirenal and mesentery fat tissue depots were found in both the SChG and prevertebral ganglia (PVG). We conclude that different adipose tissue depots (subcutaneous, perirenal and mesentery) have different sources of innervation and that there is no significant difference in the distribution of neurons innervating adipose tissue in male and female pigs.",

No evidence was found for presence of gradual depolarizations (autodepolarizations) between individual spikes. Therefore our results are consistent with the \"network\" hypothesis for the generation of sympathetic vasomotor tone. Axons of some pre-sympathetic neurones intracellularly labelled with Neurobiotin or Lucifer Yellow had collaterals arborizing in several medullary regions. Thus these neurones have synaptic inputs not only to preganglionic sympathetic neurones, but also to other, yet unidentified cells in the brainstem. Finally, our results show that anatomically adjacent RVLM pre-sympathetic and Bötzinger respiratory neurones from two functionally distinct neuronal subpopulations, and that some pre-sympathetic neurones have an adrenergic phenotype.",

Opioids regulate CREB level, its phosphorylation and binding to its corresponding response element in the promoters of several genes implicated in drug addiction. CREB mediates the action of opioids on the expression of several genes in brain regions responsible for drug -seeking behavior and manifestation of signs of dependence. Moreover, alterations in CREB level can affect the rewarding properties of morphine and regulate the self-administration of cocaine. At the cellular level CREB acts as convergence point for different cellular pathways. Opioids affect two different intracellular mediator systems: inhibitory ­connected with cAMP, and stimulatory - involving calcium and the PKC pathway. Both can affect CREB but in different phases of opiate action. The presence of this biphasic mechanism can explain the phenomenon of the induction of some CRE-controlled genes after both acute and chronic morphine administration. Cellular studies also highlight the relevance of other ATF/CREB family members which can affect Ca2+ /cAMP response element (CRE) controlled transcription as well as other transcription factors which make the opioid induction longer lasting.",

The magnitude of IOR for elderly people was also weaker than that for young adults during short SOAs. Similar magnitude and dissipation of IOR at an approximately 3.5 s cue-target interval during long SOAs were observed for both young and elderly people.

After MCA occlusion up to 45% of proteins were up- or downregulated in the ipsilateral hemisphere by a factor of 1.5 or more, as compared to sham-operated controls. The temporal regulation of several proteins in the ischemia-affected hemisphere after 1 h MCA thread occlusion is described. In the non-ischemic hemisphere the number of regulated proteins was close to 50%, indicating a hitherto unrecognized involvement of the opposite side. The proteomic approach of brain injury analysis goes beyond previous screenings of gene expression at the transcriptional level and although our study provides further evidence for the complexity of multiinjury pathways in the evolution of ischemic brain damage it may help to identify key mediators of ischemic injury.

The pronounced effect of ketamine or zoletil anesthesia on spectral entropy of higher frequency was confirmed by the higher values of Higucihi’s fractal dimension (FD) of ECoGs, with a tendency of higher FD values in cerebellar activity than cerebral activity.",

However, little information is available for BMP expression in NSCs and their lineages. In this study, based on an in vitro model in which NSCs can self-renew and differentiate into astrocytes, neurons or oligodendrocytes, we mimicked the environment of NSC development in vivo. Using an antibody which can recognize BMP-2 and BMP-4, we showed that BMP-2/4 is only expressed in astrocytes. Inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and/or interferon-gamma) do not influence the expression pattern of BMPs in NSCs and their lineages. These results suggest that astrocytes might be one source of BMPs during the differentiation of NSCs and in the inflammatory environment after CNS injury.",

    "abstract": "The production of language is one of the most complex and amazing skills in humans. Increasing evidence demonstrated that associative relations (e.g., car - garage) play an important role during concept formation but during speech production the effects and processing of associations are highly debated. Hence, the present study investigated the impact of associations and different SOAs on the production of sentences (Experiment 1) and on naming objects (Experiment 2). In an adapted version of the picture-word interference task, participants were asked to name two pictures using a standardized sentence (e.g., \"The car is to the left of the trousers\"). Thereby, a simultaneous (SOA is 0 ms) or slightly preceding (SOA is -150 ms) auditory or visual distractor had to be ignored. Distractors were related to the first noun (for example: \"The car is to the left to the trousers\", distractor: \"garage\") or to the second noun (distractor: \"belt\") or unrelated to both nouns (distractor: \"bottle\") of the sentence. At simultaneous presentation, visual and auditory distractors related to the first noun of the sentence prolonged naming responses (i.e., interference). For slightly preceding distractors, only visual presentation induced interference for the first noun of the sentence. During no condition, longer naming responses were found for the second noun of the sentence. These effects suggest that associatively related concepts are active during speech production and can be competitors, i.e., they lead to semantic interference. In Experiment 2, subjects had to name an object (e.g., car) while ignoring a visually presented distractor (e.g., motor). The stimulus set was the same as in Experiment 1. The results showed a facilitation effect if the distractor and the target were associatively related. Overall, the current results provide new insight in the models of speech production: while during single word production, associations facilitate naming, they interfere during sentence production. Hence, associations have an important influence on producing speech but the impact is varied by the context, i.e., single word or sentential.",

    "abstract": "Neural precursor cells (NPCs), which are capable of self-renewing, migrating to specific sites, and differentiating into the three main CNS lineages, neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, have been used experimentally to repair the damaged nervous system, either by grafting of cells grown in vitro or by activating endogenous NPCs. The grafting of NPCs, however, is limited by its lower viability and undesired glial differentiation. Understanding the mechanism underlying these events, therefore, is essential for the potential future use of NPCs. In the present study, we investigated the role of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition on survival, proliferation, differentiation and migration of the rat NPCs. We observed that NPCs derived from the E14.5 rat brain constitutively expressed both class I and class II HDAC mRNA. Inhibition of HDAC by trichostatin A (TSA) blocked the proliferation, increased neuronal differentiation and decreased astrocyte differentiation of the NPCs. Meanwhile, TSA had no significant effects on survival and migration of the NPCs. Finally, we found that HDAC inhibition regulated proliferation and neuronal differentiation of the NPCs was associated with a reduction of class II and but not class I HDAC transcription. These findings collectively demonstrate that in the situation of not affecting survival and migration, HDAC inhibition may induce more neuronal differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Physical interactions of cells with the adhesive substrates of the microenvironment as well as the presence of the soluble growth factors are important for the proliferation capacity of neural stem cells. We have used biofunctionalized surface domains microcontact printed with either synthetic polyaminoacid poly-L-lysine or extracellular matrix (ECM) component such as fibronectin, to study the proliferation capacity of human umbilical cord blood-derived neural stem cells (HUCB-NSC). The proliferation measured by the expression of Ki-67 protein was accompanied by the investigation of the cell morphology under the transmission and scanning electron microscopy in different culture time, plating densities of cells and medium condition (serum-free or 2 percent of FBS). The poly-L-lysine domains of defined micro-scale area promoted the presence of round, loosely attached Ki-67-positive cells, while fibronectin domains of the same size allowed appearance of flattened, strongly attached cells with more differentiated phenotype. These results were in agreement with the non-specific, electrostatic type of interaction between cell and substrate on poly-L-lysine and integrin receptor-mediated specific adhesion on fibronectin. In this report we have described in vitro culture conditions, which allow for immobilization of the non-differentiated and highly proliferating population of neural stem/progenitor cells to the biofunctionalized surface. The microarrays with bioactive domains allocating non-differentiated and proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells may find application for drug and chemicals toxicology screening of diverse factors influencing neural development.",

Subsequently, the model rats received the intragastric placebo, donepezil (5 mg per kg), or surgery to relieve carotid stenosis after bilateral carotid common artery stenosis. After carotid stenosis was relieved, the cerebral blood flow values significantly increased, and P300 latency and escape latency in the Morris water-maze were significantly shortened. The concentrations of acetylcholine and norepinephrine in the dorsal hippocampus increased after carotid stenosis was relieved. Furthermore, P300 latency and escape latency were shortened in the relief-treated group compared to the drug-treated group, and acetylcholine levels in the relief-treated group were higher than the drug-treated group. No significant difference was found for the norepinephrine levels in the dorsal hippocampus between the relief-treated and drug-treated groups. Cognitive impairment can be significantly reduced by bilateral carotid stenosis relief, and the effect of relieving stenosis on cognitive dysfunction is superior to the effect of administering an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.",

    "abstract": "Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE) is one of the most recognized causes of neurological deficits in children. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) reductions, as seen with HIE, resulting in neuronal injury have not been evaluated in real-time. Photoacoustic Tomography (PAT) is a form of optical imaging which can detect cerebral hemodynamic alterations in a noninvasive, non-ionizing fashion via changes in hemoglobin optical absorption. Further, this technology has the potential to capture cerebral blood volume (CBV) fluctuations and perhaps CBF changes in real-time. We hypothesized that PAT can detect a reduction in cerebral hemoglobin optical absorption, and therefore CBF, in a neonatal model of hypoxia-ischemia. To investigate, P7 rats underwent right carotid artery ligation and exposure to 8 percent oxygen for 60 minutes while imaged with PAT every 20 minutes. Cerebral hemodynamic alterations, as measured by mean optical absorption (MOA), were calculated as a change from baseline. Global and regional MOA was analyzed using a linear mixed model. Global MOA was reduced within the right hemisphere as compared to the left during hypoxia. Regional differences in MOA were detected between the left and right sides for the middle and posterior cortical regions. Injury was confirmed using immunohistochemistry. We conclude that a reduction in global and regional MOA, and hence CBF, could be identified by PAT in a neonatal rat model of HIE. This is the first study described in the literature utilizing a neonatal rat model of HIE to demonstrate in vivo alterations in cerebral hemodynamics in a non-invasive and near real-time fashion.",

For the fixed length of the shaft, the illusion magnitude gradually decreases with the lengthening of the reference interval. In the third series, psychophysical examination of the conventional Oppel-Kundt stimulus with different number of equally spaced elements (dots) subdividing its filled part was performed.

    "abstract": "Despite numerous studies, the molecular mechanisms underpinning the action of antipsychotic drugs remain not fully understood. It has been suggested that, in addition to the modulation of monoaminergic neurotransmission, antipsychotic drugs can also affect the expression of neurotrophic factors in the brain. The present study examines the effects of a first-generation neuroleptic drug (FGA; haloperidol) and two second-generation neuroleptic drugs (SGAs; olanzapine and amisulpride) on the expression and levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in an astrocyte-like T98G glioblastoma cell line. The effects of these drugs were compared to the action of PACAP38, a neuropeptide with well-known BDNF-mediated neuroprotective effects. The tested neuroleptics differentially regulated the mRNA expression and protein level of BDNF depending on concentration and incubation time. Real-time PCR analysis demonstrates that, of the three tested neuroleptics, both haloperidol and olanzapine at a concentration of 5 µM (but not at 20 µM) increased BDNF mRNA expression with similar efficacy after 72-hour incubation. In order to confirm the observed changes in the mRNA expression of BDNF, a protein expression assay was performed. The exposure of cells to 5 μM olanzapine alone for 72 hours increased BDNF concentration in the culture medium by 29%. Additionally, PACAP significantly up-regulated BDNF mRNA expression in T98G cells and the obtained results correlated positively with the increased production of BDNF protein, 22% above control values. Our findings show that olanzapine, similarly to exogenous PACAP38, increased BDNF mRNA expression and protein release, which can contribute to its neuroprotective mechanism of action in the cells of non-neuronal origin. The results of the paper show that olanzapine, similarly to exogenous PACAP38, increased BDNF mRNA expression and protein release, which can contribute to its neuroprotective mechanism of action in the cells of nonneuronal origin. The results of the present paper confirm the findings that BDNF may represent the key target for olanzapine and PACAP.",

    "abstract": "Limited attention capacity results that not all the stimuli present in the visual field are equally processed. While processing of salient stimuli is automatically boosted by bottom‑up attention, processing of task‑relevant stimuli can be boosted volitionally by top‑down attention. Usually, both top‑down and bottom‑up influences are present simultaneously, which creates a competition between these two types of attention. We examined this competition using both behavioral and electrophysiological measures. Participants responded to letters superimposed on background pictures. We assumed that responding to different conditions of the letter task engages top‑down attention to different extent, whereas processing of background pictures of varying salience engages bottom‑up attention to different extent. To check how manipulation of top‑down attention influences bottom‑up processing, we measured evoked response potentials (ERPs) in response to pictures (engaging mostly bottom‑up attention) during three conditions of a letter task (different levels of top‑down engagement). Conversely, to check how manipulation of bottom‑up attention influences top‑down processing, we measured ERP responses for letters (engaging mostly top‑down attention) while manipulating the salience of background pictures (different levels of bottom‑up engagement). The correctness and reaction times in response to letters were also analyzed. As expected, most of the ERPs and behavioral measures revealed a trade‑off between both types of processing: a decrease of bottom‑up processing was associated with an increase of top‑down processing and, similarly, a decrease of top‑down processing was associated with an increase in bottom‑up processing. Results proved competition between the two types of attentions.",

We focused on connectivity among brain regions that participate in olfactory‑related processes, including the piriform cortex, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), insula, and cingulate cortex. Sixteen patients with posttraumatic olfactory dysfunctions between the ages of 18 and 36 years participated in this study. Olfactory performance of subjects was evaluated using the Sniffin' Sticks test kit and then, resting‑state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed. Of the 16 participants, 8 underwent olfactory training for 16 weeks and the remaining 8 did not receive the treatment (the control group). After 16 weeks, participants in both groups underwent the same procedure (smell testing and the MRI examination). Olfactory performance scores were compared between groups using an independent samples t‑test. Spectral dynamic causal modeling was applied to resting‑state fMRI data to identify alterations in effective connectivity due to the smell training. We found that patients in the treatment group improved in the odor discrimination task and overall olfactory function as compared to the control group. Compared to the control group, patients in the treatment group had increased self‑inhibitory connectivity of the OFC and increased excitatory connectivity from the cingulate cortex to the insula. Moreover, the excitatory connectivity from the OFC to the cingulate cortex was found to be weaker following the olfactory training scheme. This study shows that a smell training scheme can cause changes in resting‑state effective connectivity parameters that can be attributed to improvements in the odor discrimination task.",

The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between disability level in multiple sclerosis (estimated by Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale), disease progression (estimated by Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score), the level of brain atrophy and lesion load (determined by MRI) and detoxification status (analyzing glutathione S-transferase P1, GSTP1, genotype profile), in a group of 58 MS patients and 68 age/gendermatched controls. The results present the first evidence on significantly higher frequency of GSTP1 C341T polymorphism (C-T transition) in healthy subjects compared to MS patients, suggesting it may act as a moderating factor in developing MS clinical phenotype. Gender-dependent distribution of the C341T polymorphism was found in both MS patients and controls, with higher frequency of C-T transition in females. In addition, preliminary data showed higher proportion of male MS patients with higher median MSSS scores, as well as lower brain atrophy level and lesion load in MS patients carrying the C341T mutation. Observed gender difference in distribution of the C341T polymorphism in MS patients, as well as in disease progression, suggests that GSTP1 detoxification pathway occurs in a gender-dependent manner and could therefore add to clinical severity in male MS patients.",

We compared such groups of German dyslexic primary school children to each other and with good reading children in a phoneme deletion task performed during fMRI scanning. Children heard German words or pseudowords and repeated the remainder of the stimulus while deleting the initial phoneme (e.g. tear – _ear). In four conditions, the input stimulus (word or pseudoword) could either become another word or pseudoword as output. The word-word condition stuck out against all other conditions involving pseudowords: Dyslexics with a double deficit showed a strong response in left areas 44 and 45 in Boca’s region, whereas dyslexics with rapid naming difficulties revealed a contralateral effect in right areas 44 and 45. These findings, which were obtained without presenting written or pictorial stimuli, reveal that a double deficit in dyslexia is not the sum of single deficits, but rather involves the interaction of lexical and phonological processing, making strong demands on the left inferior frontal cortex. In general, the results stress the importance of considering subtypes of dyslexia differentially in order to obtain better insights in the neurocognitive mechanisms of impaired and successful reading.",

    "abstract": "The parabrachial complex has been related to various rewarding or aversive behavioral processes, including taste aversion learning and conditioned place aversion. This study examined the effect of tiapride, an antagonist of D2/D3 dopaminergic receptors, on place aversion induced by electrical stimulation of the external lateral parabrachial (LPBe) nucleus. Results obtained show that brain-stimulated animals avoid the area of the maze associated with electrical stimulation but show no such behavioral rejection when they receive an injection of 30 mg/kg tiapride. Furthermore, tiapride did not appear to affect the horizontal motor activity (crossing) of the animals. These results are discussed in the context of the different natural and artificial modalities used to induce aversive behavior and their relationship with dopamine systems.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a multifactorial progressive neurodegenerative disorder leading to severe disability and death within 3–5 years after diagnosis. The main mechanisms underlying the disease progression are poorly known but according to the current knowledge, neuroinflammation is a key player in motor neurons damage. Astrocytes constitute an important cell population involved in neuroinflammatory reaction. Many studies confirmed their striking connection with motor neuron pathology and therefore they might be a target for the treatment of ALS. Cell-based therapy appears to be a promising strategy. Since direct replacement or restoring of motor neurons using various stem cells is challenging, enrichment of healthy donor-derived astrocytes appears to be a more realistic and beneficial approach. The effects of astrocytes have been examined using transplantation of glial-restricted precursors (GRPs) that represent one of the earliest precursors within the oligodendrocytic and astrocytic cell lineage. In this review, we focused on evidence-based data on astrocyte replacement transplantation therapy using GRPs in animal models of motor neuron diseases. The efficacy of GRPs engrafting is very encouraging. Furthermore, the lesson learned from application of lineage-restricted precursors in spinal cord injury (SCI) indicates that differentiation of GRPs into astrocytes before transplantation might be more advantageous in the context of axon regeneration. To sum up, the studies of glial-restricted precursors have made a step forward to ALS research and might bring breakthroughs to the field of ALS therapy in the future.",

We tested four BCI paradigms: steady‑state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP), tactile, visual, and auditory evoked potentials (P300). The proposed criterion for assessing for the possibility of communication are based on the number of correct choices obtained in a given BCI paradigm after a short calibration session, without prior training. In this study users answered 20 simple \"yes/no\" questions. Fourteen or more correct answers rejected the null hypothesis of random choices at P=0.05. All of the 30 healthy volunteers were able to attain above‑chance choices in at least one of the four paradigms. Additionally, we tested the system in clinical settings on a patient recovering from disorders of consciousness, achieving successful communication in 2 out of 3 paradigms. In light of these facts, after a review of the sparse literature, and in the interest of motivating further research, we propose a paraphrase of de Finetti's provocative statement: \"BCI illiteracy does not exist\".",

We aim to study the role of the lncRNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) in oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) treated microglia. OGD/R injury of CHME5 cells was used as an in vitro stroke model. qRT‑PCR analysis was performed to examine NEAT1, miR‑374a‑5p, nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5) and cytokines. Western blot assay detected protein levels of NFAT5 and microglia markers. The concentration of cytokines was determined by ELISA. Finally, the target relationships among NEAT1, miR‑374a‑5p and NFAT5 were observed by dual luciferase reporter experiments. After OGD/R treatment of CHME5 cells, NEAT1 and NFAT5 were enhanced, while miR‑374a‑5p was decreased. Moreover, knockdown of NEAT1 induced the shifting of OGD/R treated microglia from M1 to M2 and inhibited the inflammatory cytokines in CHME5 cells. Additionally, NEAT1 directly targeted miR‑374a‑5p while inhibition of miR‑374a‑5p reversed the role of NEAT1 downregulation in OGD/R treated microglia. Furthermore, miR‑374a‑5p directly regulated NFAT5. Interestingly, miR‑374a‑5p also contributed to the transformation of microglia with OGD/R treatment from M1 to M2 and suppressed relative expression levels of inflammatory factors by inhibiting NFAT5 in CHME5 cells. Knockdown of NEAT1 regulated OGD/R injury of CHME5 cells via miR‑374a‑5p/NFAT5 axis to induce the shifting of microglia from M1 to M2 and inhibit inflammatory response, making it a potential target for stroke treatment.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are a social problem due to their prevalence and consequences. It is crucial to explore the influence of anxiety on cognitive processes. In this study we recorded EEG activity from 73 subjects (35 patients, 38 controls, matched for age and education) during performance of the Continuous Attention Task. We used low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) for evaluation of mechanisms of impaired cognitive performance in anxiety disorders. Analysis showed that patients with anxiety disorders committed more errors than the controls, had a short latency of P300 and higher amplitude of ERPs at all steps of stimulus processing. Furthermore, we showed that there was a relationship between the scores of Hamilton Anxiety Scale and Beck Depression Inventory, and amplitudes and latencies of ERPs. The results of LORETA analysis showed that enhanced neural responses were found within circuits mediating visual information processing, sustained attention and anxiety. Also, we found higher current density within areas playing an important role in the brain fear network - anterior cingulate and anterior part of insula. Electrophysiological neuroimaging showed greater recruitment of cognitive resources in anxiety disorders, evidenced by higher current density and activation of greater number of brain areas. Despite the strategy employed to compensate for cognitive problems, the anxiety patients did not achieve the same performance as controls. Present study demonstrates that anxiety disorders influence processing of neutral stimuli and this influence is observable at both behavioral and electrophysiological level. The data suggests instability of neural systems responsible for information selection, working memory, engagement and focusing of attention.",

Locomotor activity was assessed in the open-field test.

Increased locomotor activity (hyperlocomotion) was observed at the open-field test with ketamine treatment (25 mg/kg, i.p., 8 days). Edaravone (18 mg/kg) treatment did not prevent hyperlocomotion in the mania model induced with ketamine in rats, but lithium chloride (47.5 mg/kg, i.p., positive control) did prevent hyperlocomotion. Edaravone and lithium chloride treatments were found to reduce the increase in SOD and CAT activity following ketamine administration in a non-significant manner but caused no change in TBARS levels.",

To elucidate the involvement of retrosplenial cortical areas 29c and 30 in spatial memory, we analyzed the expression of c-Fos in these areas in the experimental group of rats that were trained in a spatial place avoidance task, i.e. to avoid shocks presented in an unmarked sector of a stable arena under light conditions. Control rats were trained in the same context as the experimental rats either without (Control-noUS) or with shocks (Control-US) that were delivered in a random, noncontingent manner for three days. On the first day of place avoidance learning, the experimental group exhibited c-Fos induction in area 29c, similar to both control groups. In area 30, similarly high levels of c-Fos expression were observed in the experimental and Control-US groups. On the third day of training, when the experimental group efficiently avoided c-Fos expression in areas 29c and 30 was lower compared with the first day of training. In area 29c c-Fos level was also lower in the experimental than in comparison to the Control-US group. In area 30, c-Fos expression in the experimental group was lower than in both control groups. In conclusion, areas 29c and 30 appear to be activated during spatial memory acquisition on the first day of training, whereas area 30 seems suppressed during long-term memory functioning on the third day of training when rats effectively avoid.",

Paeoniflorin exerts a potential antidepressive effect; however, the functional roles and potential mechanisms of paeoniflorin in PPD are still largely unknown. PPD rat models were prepared by withdrawing hormone‑simulated pregnancy (HSP), and subjects were treated with paeoniflorin and fluoxetine or plasmids. The sucrose preference test (SPT), forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST) were used to monitor depression‑like behavior in rats. A radioimmunoassay was utilized for estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) measurements. ELISA was performed to detect serum corticosterone (Cor), hippocampal allopregnanolone (Allo), IL‑1β and TNF‑α levels. Expression of the E2 receptors ERα and ERβ was detected by qPCR. Western blotting was used to detect TSPO, BDNF and mTOR phosphorylation. Paeoniflorin drastically increased the sucrose preference of rats while decreasing the immobility time in the FST and TST in PPD models. Moreover, paeoniflorin intervention upregulated serum E2, hippocampal Allo, ERα, and ERβ levels but degraded P, serum Cor, IL‑1β, TNF‑α and ERα/ERβ levels. Mechanistically, paeoniflorin promoted TSPO and BDNF‑mTOR pathway activation in PPD rats. Furthermore, suppression of TSPO or the BDNF‑mTOR pathway partially reversed the effects of paeoniflorin on depression‑like behaviors, hormone levels, and inflammatory cytokine release. Paeoniflorin may improve symptoms of PPD by regulating the TSPO and BDNF‑mTOR pathways, indicating that paeoniflorin may be an effective anti‑PPD and antidepressant drug, providing evidence for the future treatment of PPD.",

    "abstract": "Postoperative cognitive dysfunction is a postoperative complication of the central nervous system that reduces quality of life and increases mortality in perioperative patients, especially among elderly patients. Many studies have shown that the incidence of postoperative cognitive impairment in adults induced by one‑time anesthesia and surgery is very low, while multiple experiences of anesthesia and surgery can induce cognitive impairment in the developing brain. However, the effect of multiple experiences of anesthesia and surgery on cognitive function over a short period in middle‑aged mice, i.e., 6 to 8 months old, remains unclear. In this study, we explored whether the cognitive function of mice aged 6-8 months is impaired after multiple operations. Middle‑aged mice (6 to 8 months old) healthy male C57BL/6 mice underwent exploratory laparotomy under isoflurane anesthesia. Morris water maze testing was performed after the operations. Blood and brain samples were collected at 6 h, 24 h, and 48 h after the operations. Serum IL‑6, IL‑1, and S‑100β concentrations were detected by ELISA. The expressions of ChAT, AChE, and Aβ in the hippocampus were measured by western blot. Up‑regulation of Iba1 and GFAP, respectively, indicated activation of microglia and astrocytes in the hippocampus. Expression of Iba1 and GFAP was examined by immunofluorescence. The present results revealed that serum IL‑6, IL‑1β, and S‑100β concentrations were enhanced after multiple instances of anesthesia and surgery, and microglia and astrocytes in the hippocampus were activated. However, learning and memory were not impaired in the middle‑aged mice by multiple experiences of anesthesia and surgery. There were no changes in ChAT, AChE, and Aβ in the hippocampus after multiple experiences of anesthesia/surgery. Taken together, we suggest that although multiple anesthesia/surgery procedures can induce peripheral inflammation, neuroinflammation, and transient cerebral injury, it is insufficient to impair learning and memory in middle‑aged mice.",

Wistar adult male rats were randomly assigned to the seven experimental groups: Group 1 received saline solution; Group 2 received methylphenidate (10 mg/kg, i.p.); Groups 3, 4, 5, and 6 received methylphenidate and minocycline for 21 days; Group 7 received minocycline alone.

    "abstract": "Many treatment initiatives, like herbal products and their active ingredients, aim to alleviate neurodegeneration to increase cognitive functions. Kaempferol may be a candidate molecule for treating neurodegeneration because of its antioxidant effects. In the present study, we examined the molecular changes associated with kaempferol’s memory‑enhancing effects on streptozotocin (STZ)‑induced neurodegeneration. After intracerebroventricular STZ injection in Long‑Evans male rats, intraperitoneal kaempferol was administered for 12 days. The Morris water maze (MWM) was used to measure learning and memory performance in the rats, and proteins related to memory formation were investigated in the hippocampi with western blotting. Kaempferol improved learning performance and memory decline in STZ‑treated rats. At the molecular level, STZ‑induced neurodegeneration resulted in a decrease in the expression of GAD67, reelin, and phosphorylated‑NMDAR. However, kaempferol treatment ameliorated these changes by enhancing their levels similar to the controls. While neither STZ injection nor kaempferol treatment produced any significant change in phosphorylated‑CAMKII levels, they increased the expression of klotho and prealbumin. These results show that kaempferol has positive effects on memory loss, affecting synaptic plasticity by ameliorating both the levels and activity of memory‑relevant molecules through reelin signaling. In summary, this study provides a guide to future studies by examining in detail the healing effect of kaempferol as a candidate molecule in the treatment of neurodegeneration, such as that observed in Alzheimer’s disease.",

To evaluate their potential influence on expiratory effort during cough, we compared expiratory muscle activity during unobstructed cough to that during obstructed cough in which the trachea was occluded at the end-inspiration and maintained throughout the subsequent expiration. Cough was evoked by mechanical stimulation of the intrathoracic trachea in 9 anesthetized, tracheotomized dogs. Peak triangularis sterni (TS), internal intercostal (IIC) and transversus abdominis (TA) muscle EMG were monitored to assess both rib cage and abdominal muscle activation during expiration. During cough, expiratory activity increased and peak activity shifted from Stage II to Stage I expiration. Peak expiratory muscle activation during unobstructed and occluded coughs were not significantly different: during unobstructed coughs, peak EMG's (mean +/- SE as percent of resting breathing) were TS, 212 +/- 18; IIC, 425 +/- 72; TA, 406 +/- 66; and during obstructed cough: TS, 188 +/- 24; IIC, 365 +/- 44; TA, 387 +/- 77 (n=9). These data indicate that enhanced vagal stimulation resulting from airway occlusion does not affect expiratory activity during cough. We suggest that during cough, the expiratory muscles are activated in a stereotypical pattern by the neural network generating the cough and this pattern of activation is not affected by phasic vagal input.",

    "abstract": "The basal ganglia comprise a group of gray matter structures beneath the cerebral cortex, that surrounds the thalamus and hypothalamus. The basal ganglia play an important role in controlling movement. The motor circuits within the striato-pallidal complex are thought to facilitate desired movement and inhibit unwanted movement through their influence, via the thalamus, mainly on cortical precentral motor regions. Localized damage to parts of the basal ganglia occurs in certain diseases such as Parkinson's disease. Parkinsonism is a common neurological disorder that affects about one person in every 1,000 of the general population and about 2% in the elderly. The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is based on the presence of two or more of the major symptoms: tremor, rigidity, postural instability, and bradykinesia. The pathological process behind the motor disabilities of Parkinsonism is a progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra, that results in dopamine depletion in the striatum. Brain dopamine deficiency is sufficient to explain all of the major symptoms of Parkinson's disease.",

The area V1 was found to project only to a dorsomedial, longitudinal region of neostriatum (NS), bordering on the lateral ventricle and subcortical white matter. The preterminal fibres in the NS form fluffs which increase in number and density in the cases with larger injections. This target region is poorly stained for calbindin and yet belongs to the matrix compartment. The secondary visual areas also project to the dorsomedial NS region but they also innervate the deeper tissue in the same general region. Iontophoresis of Fluoro-Gold into the dorsomedial NS labelled some pyramidal neurones in the fifth layer of the primary visual cortex. The cortical areas that surround the visual cortical complex project to other regions of the NS: the somatosensory cortex to a dorsolateral longitudinal region and the auditory area to the medial half of the caudalmost portion of NS. Thus, major sensory cortical divisions project to non-overlapping NS regions. Since NS in monkeys and cats does not receive afferents from the primary visual cortex and in a number of other species does, we conclude that visual systems in different mammals differ with respect to their projections to NS.",

None of the CRF-treated sheep displayed the estrous activity nor ovulated on the day of estrus (17th day of the cycle), and two days later when they were slaughtered. The GnRH center of CRF treated ewes situated in the preoptico-septal area was well organized, but irGnRH stores in the median eminence were low in comparison to the controls (sheep from the late follicular phase of the estrous cycle). The feature and the number of LH-cells in CRF-treated ewes were typical for the preovulatory phase of the cycle but the plasma concentrations of LH did not exceed basal levels.

    "abstract": "The mammalian pineal organ contains photoreceptor-specific proteins, whose distribution shows conspicuous variation among different species of mammals. Nevertheless, the following general conclusions can be drawn: immunoreactions for S-antigen and recoverin labeled more pinealocytes than the rod-opsin immunoreaction. The intensity of the recoverin- and S-antigen immunoreactions varied from cell to cell. alpha-Transducin immunoreaction was absent from the pineal organ of all mammals investigated with the exception of the blind mole rat. Immunoreaction for the cyclic GMP-gated cation channel was undetectable in the pineal organ of all mammals investigated. The functional significance of photoreceptor-specific proteins in the mammalian pineal organ remains unknown. It has been speculated that the S-antigen might be involved in adrenergic transduction mechanisms. To test this assumption, we have started to analyze calcium responses of single rat pinealocytes to norepinephrine stimulation using the Fura-2 technique. The cells were subsequently labeled by means of S-antigen immunocytochemistry. These combined investigations showed that variation in S-antigen immunoreactivity is not correlated with differences in the rapid calcium response to stimulation with norepinephrine. It remains to be determined whether cells displaying different intensities of the S-antigen immunoreaction show different cyclic AMP responses to noradrenergic stimulation. Investigations along this line should help to clarify further whether there is indeed a relation between the expression of S-antigen and noradrenergic transduction mechanisms in the mammalian pineal organ.",

In the present study we have provided additional in vitro evidence that the hippocampal GABA-A receptors are actively involved in the mechanism of theta production. Specifically, we demonstrated that bicuculline-GABA-A antagonist significantly augmented carbachol induced theta response increasing amplitude and power of rhythmical slow waves. In separate experiments the carbachol+bicuculline induced RSA were studied in the presence of muscarinic M1 and M2 antagonists--pirenzepine and gallamine (respectively) and GABA-A agonist--muscimol. Both pirenzepine and muscimol antagonized induced theta oscillations and gallamine was found to be completely ineffective in blocking this EEG response.

The rhythm of the hormone production, with maximal levels occurring at night in darkness, is generated by an endogenous circadian clock(s) and is synchronized with the photoperiodic environment to which animals are exposed. This brief outline surveys data on the regulation of rhythmic melatonin biosynthesis by a circadian pacemaker and light (full spectrum white light and monochromatic lights with wavelengths both in the visible and invisible range).

To answer this question two groups of rats were trained to an arbitrary criterion in a partially baited 12-arm radial maze under two different experimental conditions: with or without allothetic cues. After 10 days break, rats were examined under the same conditions for memory retention. Within- and between-group variation in the length of training to criterion, and in the frequency of reference and working memory errors were analysed. The present experiment confirmed the facilitating effect of the presence of distal visual cues on place learning in rats. Task-dependent (between-group) differences in the rate of learning were attributed to differences in the frequency of reference memory errors. Conversely, within-group variation in the rate of task acquisition reflected individual variation in the frequency of working memory errors. These results were looked upon from an evolutionary perspective. Low correlation between reference and working memory errors confirms that these two types of memory have different mechanisms. The fact that differences in the rate of learning were not paralleled by the differences in the memory retention supports the notion that memory acquisition and memory retention are two independent processes.",

Similarly to other members of the S100 protein family, calcyclin (S100A6) is expressed in a cell specific manner and is found in subpopulations of neurons and astrocytes in the brain and in epithelial cells and fibroblasts. In this article we review data concerning the cell specific expression of S100 protein genes and present experimental results on the regulation of the calcyclin gene. We have performed promoter deletion studies to locate regions within the calcyclin gene promoter responsible for transcriptional regulation. The results demonstrate that the 3 kb long calcyclin gene promoter lacks a cell specific cis-acting element and drives the expression of the reporter gene also in cells that do not express endogenous calcyclin. The expression is modulated by positive and negative elements acting uniformly in the four different cell lines studied. The first intron of the calcyclin gene was found to have an inhibitory influence on expression regardless of cell type. It was also shown that calcyclin expression can be induced in calcyclin-negative cells by treatment with 5-azacytidine suggesting the involvement of gene methylation in its cell specific expression. The results are discussed in light of the data available on the regulation of other S100 genes.",

While trying to explain the mechanism behind this \"contralateral facilitation effect\" in the present experiment we examined whether augmentation of function of the contralateral hemisphere would be reflected in cortical and hippocampal EEG changes in conscious rats. Unilateral, cytotoxic lesion of the VTA caused a bilateral decrease in neocortical and hippocampal EEG power during both exploratory sniffing and eating. Depression involved all the frequency bands in the prefrontal cortex, mainly in the hemisphere contralateral to the VTA lesion. In the hippocampus the depression was slightly more intense ipsilaterally, also involving all the frequency bands although to different degrees. The results indicate that the VTA is involved in the regulation of cortical and hippocampal activity during VTA-dependent behavioral activation, and that the \"contralateral facilitation effect\" is concomitant with lateralized changes in EEG activity.",

In contrast, a near 20% decrease in the activity was observed with 4% DMSO. Kinetic analysis revealed that the maximal velocity remained unchanged with increasing concentrations of DMSO up to 20%, indicating that DMSO is a competitive inhibitor of PARP-1. Thus, PARP-1 inhibition by DMSO depends on NAD+ concentration and in some pathological processes might be significant even at low DMSO concentrations. Our findings suggest that the interpretation of data from dose-response studies obtained when using common organic solvents may be dramatically skewed, either exaggerating the inherent toxicity of the compound or masking its potential for damage.",

    "abstract": "Streptozotocin (STZ) is a bacterial toxin which selectively damages both insulin-producing cells and insulin receptors. Injections of STZ into the cerebral ventricles of experimental animals are followed by sustained biochemical, metabolic and behavioral effects resembling those which are found in human brains afflicted by Alzheimer's disease. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of double intracerebroventricular application of STZ on the ultrastructure of rat frontoparietal cortical neurons. The most prominent change, seen 3 weeks after STZ injection, was a significant enlargement of the Golgi apparatus caused by expansion of the trans-Golgi segment of the cellular protein secretory pathway. Morphometric analysis revealed that the area of the trans part of the Golgi complex in neuronal cells was increased more than two-fold (median values: 312 x 10(3) nm in 14 neurons from control animals, and 846 x 10(3) nm3 in 19 neurons from STZ-treated animals, P = 0.0012), whereas that of the cis part did not significantly change. The effects of STZ did not resemble Golgi atrophy and fragmentation described in neurons from disease-prone brain structures of patients with Alzheimer's disease, but were similar to that observed after intravenous application of a non-metabolizable glucose analog 2-deoxyglucose. Considering that proamyloidogenic processing of beta-amyloid precursor protein may occur preferentially in the trans-Golgi segment, the observed early response of neuronal ultrastructure to desensitization of insulin receptors may predispose cells to form beta-amyloid deposits.",

    "abstract": "The ability of normal cats to perform delayed matching- and nonmatching-to-sample with trial-unique stimuli was investigated both in a modified Wisconsin General Testing Apparatus requiring manipulatory responses and in a Nencki-type testing room requiring locomotor responses. Cats trained in the WGTA learned the two tasks at about the same rate, on average, as that reported for monkeys. However, unlike monkeys, whose strong preference for novelty facilitates their learning of the nonmatching rule and retards their learning of the matching rule, the cats learned the two different rules at about the same rate, suggesting that cats do not share the monkey's strong preference for novelty. In contrast to their relatively rapid learning of the manipulatory versions of the two tasks, cats learned the locomotor versions only slowly or even failed to learn. Experimental analysis indicated that a major source of the cats' difficulty on these locomotor versions was interference from a strong tendency in the large testing room to use visuospatial strategies. Nevertheless, once the matching or nonmatching rule was learned at short delays, whether in the WGTA or the testing room, the cats performed at criterion levels without further training even at delays of 10 minutes, indicating that this species, like monkeys, has a highly developed long-term recognition memory ability.",

    "abstract": "This paper reviews studies that investigated mechanisms of the induction of long-term synaptic efficacy increase in local horizontal connections in slices of adult rat motor cortex. Long-term potentiation (LTP) could be induced by electrical stimulation of afferents using theta burst stimulation (TBS) conditionally, when synaptic inhibition was transiently blocked by focal application of GABAA receptor antagonist. Robust, long-lasting enhancement of synaptic transmission in horizontal connections was induced by brief application of the potassium channel blocker, tetraethylammonium (TEA, 25 mM), to the incubation medium. This TEA-LTP could be blocked by nifedipine, a voltage-dependent calcium channel blocker. A transient exposure of slices to elevated extracellular calcium (5 mM) resulted in a long-lasting enhancement of responses, termed Ca-LTP, which could be blocked by the antagonist of NMDA receptors, APV. The induction of both TEA-LTP and Ca-LTP, could be prevented by inhibitors of the extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) cascade U0126 and PD 98059. A transient activation of the ERK, 15 min after application of TEA or elevated [Ca2+], was demonstrated using immunofluorescence. Both forms of plasticity could also be prevented by the inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinases (PKA), Rp-cAMPS. These studies indicate the involvement of the ERK and PKA signaling mechanisms in synaptic plasticity of the motor cortex in vitro. Since LTP in horizontal connections of the motor cortex has previously been shown to be related to the acquisition of a motor skill, it is suggested that the ERK and PKA signaling pathways may be involved in motor learning.",

Our results join those of other recent studies in suggesting strongly that, the generation of neural-like cells from tissue belonging to a different germ layer (such as a cord blood is) is most probably explained by reference to a discrete subpopulation of embryonic-like stem cells of pluripotent characteristics. Such cells identified in cord blood through their expression of specific genetic and protein markers can be expanded in vitro and directed toward neurally-committed progenitors differentiating further into more mature neuron-like or macroglia-like cell phenotypes. From this HUCB-derived neural progenitor fraction a novel neural-like stem cell line (HUCB-NSC) has been developed, and characterized in respect of in vitro and in vivo (post-transplantation) properties.",

The stimuli were made of two spatially superimposed illusory figures that differed in structure and luminance contrast but had the same length and coincided precisely, with their ends matched. The contrast of one of the figures was fixed, and that of the other varied. In experiments with stimuli viewed monocularly, the combined patterns produced illusions of perceived length, the strength of which varied with alterations of contrast of one of the figures. If the figures were presented separately to different eyes of the same subject, changes of contrast did not have a noticeable influence on the illusion's strength. When the two stimulus components were displaced spatially and shown side by side, the monoptic and dichoptic stimuli yielded different results as well. The illusion's strength increased with an increase of the distance between the figures when viewed monocularly, but remained invariable if the figures were presented separately to each eye. The results obtained in experiments with dichoptic stimuli suggest that stimulus length distortions may occur in the monocular retinocortical pathways.",

Vacuous chewing movements (VCMs) in rats are widely accepted as an animal model of TD. Results show that haloperidol injected at a dose of 1 mg/kg twice a day for 5 weeks elicited VCMs, which increased in a time dependent manner following the drug administration for 3-5 weeks. Tolerance was produced in motor coordination during the potentiation of VCMs. Exploratory activity in an open field and in an activity box decreased in haloperidol treated animals. The effects of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetraline (8-OH-DPAT; 0.5 mg/kg) were monitored 48-h after withdrawal from repeated administration of haloperidol. 8-OH-DPAT-induced locomotion was greater in haloperidol treated rats. 5-HT synthesis increased in haloperidol treated animals, while 8-OH-DPAT-induced decreases of 5-HT synthesis were greater in repeated haloperidol than repeated saline injected animals. The results suggest that an increase in the effectiveness of somatodendritic 5-HT-1A receptors may decrease the inhibitory influence of 5-HT on the activity of dopaminergic neurons to precipitate VCMs. The 5-HT-1A agonist may help to alleviate neuroleptic-induced TD.",

The response to treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors is clinically difficult to predict.

In this paper, consistently with previous reports, we confirm that higher initial disease severity and faster progression of cognitive impairment increase the chance of a clinically meaningful response to cholinesterase inhibitor therapy in a carefully selected population of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, for the first time we demonstrate the association between the increase in the concentration of plasma Abeta(1-42) peptide after 2 weeks of treatment with an initial dose of rivastigmine and the likelihood of a positive response to treatment after 6 months. A change in plasma Abeta(1-42) level might constitute a novel biochemical predictor of rivastigmine treatment efficacy in Alzheimer's disease.",

Our previous study shows that tacrolimus (FK506) and cyclosporin A (CsA) applied following the injury can also decrease or increase the seizure susceptibility in an age-dependent way. To find possible neuronal substrates of the effects, we examined influences of the agents on the injured brain and on its neuronal population. Rat brains were mechanically injured on postnatal days 6 (P6) or 30 (P30). Twenty minutes and 24 hours following the injury, FK506 or CsA were injected in clinically used pharmaceutical formulations (Prograf® or Sandimmun®, respectively). The brains were fixed on postnatal day 60 and processed for histological examinations. To detect if negative effects of the injury could be abolished by the treatments, we examined the brain weight, the size of the injured region, and the nerve cell density, including the density of calretinin- and parvalbumin-immunopositive cells. We have found that long-term effects of treatments with the FK506- and CsA-containing pharmaceutical formulations were never better than those of the vehicle alone (Cremophor and ethanol mixture). Moreover, the treatments could even amplify negative consequences of the injury alone. It could, therefore, be concluded that all the neuroprotective effects observed in the present study resulted exclusively from the influence of the vehicle alone. These effects of the brain injury and of subsequent treatments performed at different developmental stages were considered as possible determinants of further increase or decrease in susceptibility to seizures observed in adulthood.",

Magnetic stimuli did not wake the sleeping animal, and being applied during slow wave sleep evoked clear responses in EEG with a latency of 80–100 ms. These responses disappeared during wakefulness and rapid eye movement sleep. Control experiments confirmed that these responses were not caused by the acoustic clicks produced by the magnetic coil. Results of this study further confirm that during sleep, signals from visceral organs reach the cortical areas which in wakefulness process exteroceptive sensory information.

    "abstract": "In order to understand the physiological role of the caudate nucleus, we combine here our laboratory data on cats with reports of patients with selective damage to this nucleus. Cats with bilateral removal of the caudate nuclei showed a stereotyped behavior consisting of persistently approaching and then following a person, another cat, or any object, and attempting to contact the target. Simultaneously, the animals exhibited a friendly disposition and persistent docility together with purring and forelimbs treading/kneading. The magnitude and duration of this behavior was proportional to the extent of the removal reaching a maximum after ablations of 65% or more of the caudate tissue. These cats were hyperactive but they had lost the feline elegance of movements. Additional features of acaudate cats were: (1) postural and accuracy deficits (plus perseveration) in paw usage tasks including bar pressing for food reward; (2) cognitive and perceptual impairments on a T-maze battery of tasks and on the bar pressing tasks; (3) blockage or blunting of the species-specific behavioral response to a single injection of morphine; Unilateral caudate nucleus removal did not produce global behavioral effects, but only deficit in the contralateral paw contact placing reaction and paw usage/bar pressing. Moreover and surprisingly, we found hypertrophy of the ipsilateral caudate nucleus following prenatal focal neocortical removal. The findings in human were also behavioral (not neurological) and also occurred with unilateral caudate damage. The main manifestations consisted of loss of drive (apathy), obsessive-compulsive behavior, cognitive deficits, stimulus-bound perseverative behavior, and hyperactivity. Based on all of the above data we propose that the specific function of the caudate nucleus is to control approach-attachment behavior, ranging from plain approach to a target, to romantic love. This putative function would account well for the caudate involvement in the pathophysiology of a number of clinical syndromes that we mention, all of which compromise approach-attachment- affect behaviors. In addition we conclude that the caudate nucleus contributes importantly to body and limbs posture as well as to the accuracy and speed of directed movements",

    "abstract": "The neurosteroids, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and androsterone, are implicated in drug addictions. We examined their influence on locomotor activity and reward in male Wistar rats, and on steroid and monoamine metabolism in the hippocampus and striatum. In the open field test, DHEAS injections (10, 40, 80 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 min prior the test had no significant effect on ambulation, but androsterone (10 mg/kg) increased general locomotion and at doses 1-10 mg/kg, increased central field activity, suggestive of an anxiolytic action. In the conditioned place preference test, both steroids had a biphasic effect: DHEAS was rewarding at doses of 10 and 40 mg/kg, but not at 80 mg/kg, while androsterone was rewarding at doses of 1 and 10 mg/kg, but aversive at 40 mg/kg. Monoamine and steroid concentrations were analyzed in homogenates from the hippocampus and striatum of DHEAS and androsterone injected rats. DHEAS reduced the hippocampal dopamine level, increased striatal homovanilic acid (HVA) and decreased the striatal serotonin concentrations. Androsterone did not affect dopamine levels or turnover, but increased noradrenaline concentration and serotonin turnover in the hippocampus. DHEAS administration augmented concentrations of DHEA, pregnenolone, androstendiol and androstentriol in both brain structures, while androsterone injections increased brain levels of androsterone, epiandrosterone, 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone, and androstandiol. Present data document that although psychobehavioral and neurochemical effects of DHEAS and androsterone differ in several aspects; both neurosteroids have rewarding properties at certain dose ranges, suggesting their likely involvement in addictions, which entail different mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to compare electrophysiological parameters of night sleep in narcolepsy type 1 and hypersomnia associated with a psychiatric disorder. Fortyfour patients: 15 with narcolepsy type 1, 14 with hypersomnia associated with a psychiatric disorder and 15 age- and sex-matched controls participated in the study. The study subjects filled in the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The severity of daytime sleepiness was quantified subjectively using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS), and objectively using the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). All subjects underwent polysomnography (PSG) on the two consecutive nights. The data from the second night was analysed. The slow wave activity (SWA, 1-4 Hz) was calculated for the three consecutive sleep cycles, and topographic delta power maps were plotted. In contrast to narcoleptics, psychiatric hypersomniacs had undisturbed nocturnal sleep, high sleep efficiency, normal non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep proportions, normal REM latency and sleep latencies on MSLT and PSG. The subjective and objective sleepiness was significantly higher in narcolepsy group than in psychiatric hypersomnia group. In all the study groups SWA was the most prominent in frontal areas, while the greatest between-group differences were found in the central areas. There were significant differences between the groups in SWA in the second NREM episode. The highest SWA was observed in the hypersomnia group, while the lowest in the narcolepsy group. Psychiatric hypersomniacs and controls did not differ in the SWA exponential decline over consecutive NREM episodes, whereas narcoleptics exhibited a steeper dissipation of sleep pressure from the first to the second NREM episode. In conclusion, narcolepsy type1 and hypersomnia associated with psychiatric disorder differ in the SWA dynamics. Narcoleptics presented with the altered dynamics of sleep homeostasis, whereas psychiatric hypersomniacs showed normal nocturnal sleep and normal sleep homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Oxaliplatin is a third-generation, platinum-based antitumor drug used to treat colorectal cancer. Since its main adverse effect is neuropathic pain resulting from chemotherapy‑induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), this drug is used to study the neurobiology of CIPN in rodents and to search for analgesics that could attenuate neuropathic pain symptoms - cold and tactile allodynia that develop in most of the oxaliplatin‑treated subjects. In this research, testing across various temperatures, we assessed the cold reactivity threshold of albino Swiss mice treated with oxaliplatin. We also investigated if amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant drug and a sodium channel inhibitor, could attenuate cold allodynia caused by this chemotherapeutic drug. Cold allodynia was induced using a single intraperitoneal dose of oxaliplatin. In the cold plate test while testing various temperatures the pain sensitivity threshold was assessed at different time-points after oxaliplatin (late‑phase allodynia). Antiallodynic activity of intraperitoneal amitriptyline was assessed for doses of 1, 2.5 and 10 mg/kg. A statistically significant decrease in latency time to pain reaction was detected for all temperatures applied, but the earliest response (i.e., 2 h post‑injection) was noted at 2.5°C. In all experimental groups early‑phase cold allodynia was fully developed 3 h after oxaliplatin injection and it was maintained until the end of the observation period (7 days). Early‑phase cold allodynia induced by oxaliplatin can be effectively attenuated by amitriptyline.",

    "abstract": "Humans use temporal regularities in their daily life to act in accordance with future events in the most efficient way. To achieve this, humans build temporal expectations and determine a template action that is in line with those expectations. In this temporal trisection study, we aimed to study the neurophysiological counterparts of temporal expectation and response discrimination. We investigated amplitude variations of early event-related potentials (ERPs) while manipulating time intervals. We measured temporal expectation-related attenuation of neural activity and response discrimination processes in N1 and P2 ERP components. Results showed that the amplitude of the N1 component was attenuated for the predicted task-relevant temporal location of a response decision. The P2 amplitude, in contrast, was enhanced for a discriminated response in comparison to a template response. The present study supports a link between the different functional associations of the N1 and P2 components within the requirements of a timing task. N1-related amplitude modulation can determine a change in expectation level during timing. The amplitude regulation of the P2 component, in contrast, explains temporal discrimination in both expected and unexpected temporal locations. In addition to expectation‑related modulation, our results suggest an additional regulation of the N1 amplitude that is linked to attention. The effect was observed in instances that included a prediction error of a task-relevant temporal location for a response decision. In conclusion, our study contributes to the growing neurocognitive literature on interval timing by capturing different aspects of a timing task; namely, N1-related expectation and P2-related response discrimination processes.",

    "abstract": "Impaired working memory is a common feature of neuropsychiatric disorders. It is dependent on control of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neurons by dopamine. The purpose of this study was to test the effects of a D1/5-type dopamine receptor agonist (SKF 38393, 10 microM) on the membrane potential and on voltage-dependent fast-inactivating Na+ currents in mPFC pyramidal neurons obtained from adult (9-week-old) rats. Treatment of the pyramidal neurons with SKF 38393 did not affect the membrane potential recorded with the perforated-patch method. When recordings were performed in cellattached configuration, the application of SKF 38393 did not change the Na+ current amplitude and shifted the currentvoltage relationship of the Na+ currents towards hyperpolarisation, thus resulting in an increase of the current amplitudes in response to suprathreshold depolarisations. Pretreatment of the cells with a D1/5 receptor antagonist (SCH 23390, 10 microM) abolished the effect of the D1/5-type receptors on Na+ currents. The effect of the D1/5 agonist was replicated by treating the cells with a membrane-permeable analogue, cAMP (8-bromo-cAMP, 100 microM), and the effect was blocked by treating the cells with a protein kinase A inhibitor, (H-89, 2 microM). In recordings performed from mechanically and enzymatically dispersed pyramidal neurons in the whole-cell configuration, when the cell interior was dialysed with pipette solution, application of the D1/5 agonist decreased the Na+ current amplitude without changing the current-voltage relationship. We conclude that in the mPFC pyramidal neurons in slices with an intact intracellular environment (recordings in the cell-attached configuration), the activation of D1/5 dopamine receptors increases the fast-inactivating Na+ current availability in response to suprathreshold depolarisations. The maximum Na+ current amplitude was not changed. A cAMP/protein kinase A pathway was responsible for the signal transduction from the D1/5 dopamine receptors to the Na+ channels.",

It was found that the combination (losartan 100 micrograms + Ang II 0.5 micrograms) microinjected bilaterally or into the left CA1 area improved learning and memory in shuttle-box and step through behavioral tests as compared to the respective controls. The effects were more pronounced after injection into the left CA1 area as compared to the right-side. These findings suggest thatAng II infused on the background of the inhibited CA1 hippocampal AT1 receptors ameliorated the cognitive processes. The data show also an asymmetric effect of Ang II on learning and memory processes in the hippocampus. The stronger modulating effect after microinjection of the combination (losartan + Ang II) into the left CA1 hippocampal area suggests a leftward bias in the rat. The results point to a differential distribution of angiotensin II receptors modulating the learning and memory processes in the left and right hippocampal CA1 area.",

These cells have shown great potential as a therapeutic tool for central nervous system diseases and disorders. However whether these cells are able to produce neurons with similar developmental and functional characteristics to indigenous neurons within the brain remains poorly investigated. In this study, we used purified umbilical cord blood non-hematopoietic stem cells to produced GABAergic neurons with similar developmental and functional characteristics to cortical GABAergic neurons. We analyzed the expression of transcription factors MASH1, DLX1 and DLX2 throughout the 24 days of a sequential neuronal induction protocol and found that their expression patterns resembled those reported in the developing human cortex. The derived neurons also expressed components of GABAergic neurotransmission including GABA regulatory enzymes, GABA receptor subunits and GABA transporters. Thus we have demonstrated that umbilical cord blood stem cells are capable of producing cortical-like GABAergic neurons in vitro. This highlights the potential of umbilical cord blood stem cells as a therapeutic tool for neural injuries and disorders.",

The mechanisms of that use-dependent improvement are still not fully understood. This review tackles three aspects of this issue: (1) neurochemical attributes of functional improvement showing that concentrations of excitatory and inhibitory amino acids in the lumbar spinal segments, which were changed after transection, normalize after the training, or even raise beyond normal. As it does not translate to functional equilibrium between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission and may lead to hyperexcitability, the postsynaptic mechanisms which might be responsible for the hyperexcitability are discussed, including (i) dysfunction of K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter KCC2, which controls the strength and robustness of inhibition, and (ii) altered function of 5-HT2 receptors, which may be targeted to restore KCC2 activity and intrinsic inhibition; (2) morphological changes of lumbar motoneurons and their inputs related to functional improvement of spinal animals, pointing to use-dependent diminution/reversal of the atrophy of the dendritic tree of the hindlimb motoneurons and of their synaptic impoverishment, which in paraplegic animals differs depending on the degree of disuse of the muscles; (3) the role of neurotrophins in motor improvement of spinal animals showing, that increases in neurotrophins due to training or due to efficient viral vector-based transgene expression, that might be responsible for the enrichment of the dendritic tree, elongation of processes and influence neurotransmitter systems in the areas subjected to plastic modifications after injury, correlate with improvement of locomotor functions.",

    "abstract": "Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by motor and vocal tics. The etiology of the disorder is unknown, although the predominant role of genetic factors has been established. Variants of the BTBD9 gene (rs4714156, rs9296249 and rs9357271) have been reported to be associated with GTS in French Canadian and Chinese Han populations. Therefore, we decided to test the association between GTS and polymorphisms of the BTBD9 gene in Polish patients. Our cohort of GTS cases comprised 162 patients aged 4–54 years (mean age: 19.9+/-8.7 years; 131 males, 80.9 percent). The control group consisted of 180 healthy persons aged 14–55 years (mean age: 23.1+/-2.1 years; 149 males, 82.8 percent). The rs4714156, rs9296249 and rs9357271 variants of the BTBD9 gene were genotyped. No significant differences were found in minor allele frequencies (MAFs) of the SNPs tested between the two groups. The frequency of MAFs of the genotyped SNPs was lower in GTS patients with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (for rs9357271 and rs9296249, P=0.039 and rs4714156, P=0.040) and higher in GTS patients without comorbidities (for rs9357271 and rs9296249 P=0.021 and rs4714156 P=0.025). There was a trend toward an association between the minor allele of the SNPs and mild tics (P=0.089 for rs9357271 and rs9296249, P=0.057 for rs4714156). Despite limitations of the study, including the small number of cases and analyzed SNPs, our results suggest that the examined BTBD9 variants are not associated with GTS risk, but may be associated with comorbidity and tic severity in the Polish population.",

Elaborating the protocols for the efficient oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) generation for neurorestrative purposes still meets the essential obstacles. Searching for the most convenient, accessible and rich sources of stem-like cells is the first of them. The immunological barrier is another problem, which could however be solved by usage of either the allo- or the autografts and the pure, xeno-free compounds for the cell propagation. The third criterion is the efficiency of the progenitor derivation, proliferation and purification. The effective cellular replacement experiments carried on animal models of congenital and acquired neurodegenerative disease approached their translation into clinical practice. Notwithstanding due to urgent need for treatment of a broad spectrum of traumas and neurodegenerative disorders accompanied by hypo/demyelination, different cell sources and alternative strategies should necessarily be tested to expand the treatment options.",

    "abstract": "Because ketamine and magnesium block NMDA receptor activation by distinct mechanisms of action, we hypothesized that in a model of inflammatory pain in rats the combination of ketamine and magnesium might be more effective than ketamine alone. Antinociceptive activity was assessed by the formalin test in male Wistar rats (200-250 g). Animals were injected with 100 μL of 2.5% formalin to the plantar surface of the right hind paw. Data were recorded as the total time spent in pain-related behavior after the injection of formalin or vehicle (0.9% NaCl). Ketamine and magnesium sulfate given separately reduced nocifensive behavior in the second phase of the formalin test in rats. When ketamine was applied after magnesium sulfate, the log dose-response curves for the effects of ketamine and the magnesium sulfate-ketamine combination revealed antagonistic interaction, and about 1.6 (CL 1.2-2.4) fold increment in ketamine dosage. A low dose of magnesium sulfate (5 mg/kg, subcutaneously) administered after ketamine increased the antinociceptive effect of ketamine by a factor of only 1.2 (CL 0.95-1.38), indicating an additive interaction. There was a 1.8-fold reduction in dosage of ketamine when ketamine was administered before rather than after the magnesium sulfate. The present study revealed that both ketamine and magnesium reduced pain-related behavior in the second phase of the formalin test in rats. Ketamine, when administered before or after the magnesium, provided additive or antagonistic antinociceptive interactions, respectively. Whether there will be an additive or antagonistic antinociceptive interaction between ketamine and magnesium depends on the order of drug administration.",

However, it is not known whether RYGB‑induced microglia activation is the cause or an effect of the reported neuronal damage. Therefore, the aim of this study was to establish the order of neurodegenerative responses in vagal afferents after RYGB in the nodose ganglia (NG) and NTS in male and female rats. Sprague‑Dawley rats were fed regular chow or an energy‑dense diet for two weeks followed by RYGB or sham surgery. Twenty‑four hours later, animals were sacrificed and NG and NTS were collected. Neuronal cell damage was determined by TUNEL assay. Microglia activation was determined by quantifying the fluorescent staining against the ionizing calcium adapter‑binding molecule 1. Reorganization of vagal afferents was evaluated by fluorescent staining against isolectin 4. Results of the study revealed significantly increased DNA fragmentation in vagal neurons in the NG when observed at 24 h after RYGB. The surgery did not produce rapid changes in the density of vagal afferents and microglia activation in the NTS. These data indicate that decreased density of vagal afferents and increased microglia activation in the NTS likely ensue as a res ult of RYGB‑induced neuronal damage.",

    "abstract": "Following nerve tissue damage, various events, such as inflammatory responses, microglial activation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and apoptosis, can occur, which all lead to cell death, prevent axonal growth, and cause axonal circumvolution.So far, several researchers have tended to adopt strategies to reduce the harmful conditions associated with neurological disorders, and stem-cell-based therapy is one of those promising strategies.Epidermal neural crest stem cells (EPI-NCSCs) are a type of stem cell that has widely been employed for the treatment of various neurological disorders.It has been suggested that these stem cells perform their supportive actions primarily through the release of different neurotrophic factors.Hence, in this study, the neuroprotective impacts of valproic acid (VPA) and crocin were evaluated on the mRNA expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial-cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in EPI-NCSCs.In this research, we isolated EPI-NCSCs from the hair follicles of the rat whisker pad.Then, the cells were treated with different concentrations of VPA and crocin for 72 h.Subsequently, an MTT assay was performed to define the suitable concentrations of drugs.Finally, real-time PCR was performed to evaluate the mRNA expression levels of BDNF and GDNF in these stem cells.The results of the MTT assay showed that the treatment of EPI-NCSCs with 1 mM VPA and 1.5 mM crocin, and the co-treatment with 1 mM VPA and 500 µM crocin, led to the survival and proliferation of these stem cells.Moreover, the real-time PCR results revealed that both VPA and crocin, both individually and in combination, can significantly increase the expression levels of BDNF and GDNF in EPI-NCSCs.According to the findings of this study, both VPA and crocin, alone and in combination, are potential candidates for enhancing the capacity of EPI-NCSCs to differentiate into neural lineages.Therefore, the co-treatment of EPI-NCSCs with these drugs can be employed for the treatment of various neurological disorders, such as spinal cord injury.",

HSAN-affected patients manifest with deep, poorly-healing ulcerations of the feet and hands. To date no definitive cure for HSANs has been developed and the molecular pathology of these disorders is complex. The aim of this review is therefore to present recent findings in terms of HSAN molecular pathogenesis. So far, mutations in 12 genes coding for different proteins have been reported in association with HSAN and the molecular pathogenesis has been elucidated in HSAN1a, HSAN4 and HSAN5. The genes involved in molecular pathogenesis of HSAN code for a wide spectrum of proteins from enzymes to specific nerve growth factors. As far as HSAN1a is concerned, the enhanced understanding has given rise to achievements in experimental therapy particularly in respect to disease models. Despite a rapid progress in studies on the molecular background of HSAN, numerous loci and genes remain still to be discovered.",

In this study we have analysed this so-called non-genomic effect of testosterone on social anxiety in rats of both sexes using androgen and oestrogen receptor blockers. Male rats were divided into four groups: SHAM-CTRL (a sham operated group treated with oil as vehicle, n=10), SHAM-TST (a sham operated group treated with testosterone at a dose of 1 mg/kg, n=10), GDX-CTRL (a castrated group treated with oil, n=10) and GDX-TST (a castrated group treated with testosterone at a dose of 1 mg/kg, n=10). Female rats were divided into two groups: OVX-CTRL (an ovariectomized group treated with oil, n=10) and OVX-TST (an ovariectomized group treated with testosterone, n=10). The intracellular androgen receptor was blocked with flutamide and both intracellular oestrogen receptors were blocked with tamoxifen (a selective oestrogen receptor modulator). Rats were tested one hour after oil or testosterone administration in the social interaction test. Although the concentration of testosterone was higher in testosterone groups, no significant difference in social interaction was observed between the groups. In summary, in this first study focusing on the non-genomic effects of testosterone on social interaction no rapid effects of testosterone in adult rats were found. Further studies should analyse potential non-genomic effects of testosterone on other forms of social behaviour.",

A high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was first described in a 2013 study in patients with manifest Huntington's disease, where serum vitamin D level was found to be associated with motor capabilities of the patients. Our objective was to investigate the effect of a high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation on a transgenic mouse model of Huntington's disease. Our study was performed on N171-82Q Huntington's disease transgenic mice in age- and gender-matched groups. We collected data on the motor state and survival of the mice. The results demonstrate that though vitamin D3 had no effect on the motor performance of transgenic mice, but significantly increased the lifespan of transgenic animals (Kaplan-Meier survival curves: vehicle-supplemented group: 73 (67-94) days vs. vitamin D3-supplemented group: 101 (74-109) days, p=0.048 Mantel-Cox log rank test). Further investigations are needed to determine whether a neuroprotective or a general corroborative effect of vitamin D leads to the measured effect. Our findings support the potential influence of vitamin D deficiency on the disease course and propose that vitamin D may be an effective supplementary treatment to beneficially influence clinical features of Huntington's disease.",

    "abstract": "Levetiracetam (LEV) is a drug commonly used as an anticonvulsant. However, recent evidence points to a possible role as an antioxidant. We previously demonstrated the antioxidant properties of LEV by significantly increasing catalase and superoxide dismutase activities and decreasing the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels in the hippocampus of rats with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) showing scavenging properties against the hydroxyl radical. The aim of the present work was to evaluate, the effect of LEV on DNA oxidation, by determining 8‑hydroxy‑2‑deoxyguanosine (8‑OHdG) levels, and glutathione content, through reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione levels, in the hippocampus of rats with TLE. Male Wistar rats were assigned to the control (CTRL), CTRL+LEV, epileptic (EPI) and EPI+LEV groups. TLE was induced using the lithium‑pilocarpine model. Thirteen weeks after TLE induction, LEV was administered for one week through osmotic pumps implanted subcutaneously. The determination of 8‑OHdG, GSH and GSSG levels were measured using spectrophotometric methods. We showed that LEV alone significantly increased 8‑OHdG and GSSG levels in the hippocampus of control rats compared to those in epileptic condition. No significant differences in GSH levels were observed. LEV could induce changes in the hippocampus increasing DNA oxidation and GSSG levels under nonepileptic condition but not protecting against the mitochondrial dysfunction observed in TLE probably by mechanisms related to changes in chromatin structure, neuroinflammation and alterations in redox components.",

The results show that elderly subjects performed the experimental task more slowly with a lower mean movement frequency and a smaller amplitude. Despite of this fact, the elderly's upright posture was destabilized by this movement to a greater extent than in young subjects. The older adults exhibited lower damping of the disturbing torques produced by arm movements as evidenced by a higher amplitude of the center of foot pressure excursions.

The DMS training was continued until attaining a criterion 90% correct responses in 90 consecutive trials. After a control pause, the dogs were retrained to the criterion, and then they were given performance tasks with delays extended to 10-, 30-, 60- and finally to 90-s, in blocks of 90 trials. Dogs required about 1,000 trials of auditory recognition memory training in order to reach the criterion. Their behavior was also stable after the control pause. The dogs performance declined gradually with extended delays reaching an average of 63.4% for the delay of 90 s. Results indicate that the DMS task with auditory stimuli alternating during the testing stage of trial, is a promising method for testing auditory recognition memory.",

We intended to determine whether mild hypothermia would have a protective effect against cytotoxic brain edema, the early stage of ischemic brain edema. Two groups of Wistar rats (37 degrees C and 35 degrees C body temperature) were subjected to 6 h of moderate decrease of cerebral blood flow (CBF) by means of permanent bilateral carotid artery ligation, and compared to a third group of unaffected animals. Carotid artery ligation induced a local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) reduction to 50-80% of baseline values. LCBF in the frontal cortex was restored to a higher level in hypothermic animals than in normothermic ones (P < 0.05). In normothermic animals, an increase of brain water content was detected in the frontoparietal and occipital cortex as well as in the hippocampus (P < 0.05), but only in one region of the frontoparietal cortex in hypothermic animals. The impermeability of the blood-brain barrier to proteins was shown by the absence of staining with Evans blue as an indicator of vasogenic brain edema. We conclude that mild hypothermia offers protection against the development of cytotoxic brain edema.",

Therefore, in this experiment the amplitude and the latency of the acoustic startle reflex were assessed for a fixed pulse duration and for a variety of stimulus frequencies ranging between 3 and 23 kHz. The ASRs were studied in 11 adult hooded rats exposed to 2-ms (120 dB SPL) tone pulses of different frequencies presented in random order, with or without 70 dB white noise background. Statistical analysis of the data revealed significant differences between ASR amplitudes for different frequencies. In our experimental situation the rats responded more readily to a low frequency stimulus. The startle amplitude decreased with tonal frequencies and distinguishable difference were seen for 3, 7, and 10 kHz pulses. However, such differences were not readily observed for higher frequencies i.e. 15, 20, 23 kHz. The same pattern of differences was observed when the acoustic stimulus was presented with the white noise background. The observed differences may be attributed, firstly, to a spectral characteristic of the stimulus and thus to an audibility in rats and secondly to a behavioral meaning of a stimulus of a different frequency.",

    "abstract": "Oestrogens protect neurons against excitatory amino acid-induced toxicity; however data on their interaction with particular subtype of glutamate receptors are sparse. Therefore in the present study we investigated oestrogen effects on kainate neurotoxicity in primary cortical neurons. The data showed that both oestradiol-17 beta and oestrone (100 nM and 200 nM) reduced kainate toxicity by ca. 40%. Since tamoxifen only partly inhibited the above effects, we suggest that both genomic and non-genomic mechanisms are involved in the anti-kainate action of oestrogens.",

    "abstract": "The pattern of GnRH secretion during the follicular phase of the estrous cycle of sheep is characterized by an initial marked change in episodic secretion (increased frequency and decreased amplitude) followed by a massive and sustained discharge-the preovulatory GnRH surge. Studies employing a physiological model for the follicular phase have revealed that estradiol has profound and complex feedback effects on GnRH release during the preovulatory period. These include both quantitative effects on pulses (stimulation of frequency, inhibition of amplitude) and qualitative effects (altering pulse shape, stimulating interpulse secretion), in addition to inducing a preovulatory GnRH surge. In stimulating the surge, estradiol causes a highly characteristic change in the minute-to-minute pattern of GnRH in hypophyseal portal blood. Initially, a strictly episodic pattern gives way to one in which GnRH is consistently elevated between pulses. Then, following enhancement of both pulsatile and interpulse components, GnRh becomes extremely high and variable for the majority of the surge. From this point, a regular and well organized pulse pattern is not apparent. The characteristic time course of GnRH at surge onset provides insight into possible mechanistic changes in the GnRH neurosecretory system. Such changes include quantitative and qualitative alterations in the pulse generating mechanism, recruitment of a surge specific population of GnRH neurones, morphologic alterations in GnRH neurones and neighboring cells, and changes in efficiency or route of delivery of GnRH from its site of release to the portal vasculature. These possibilities, while untested and speculative, provide a conceptual framework for future research.",

Presented results show that DTI of the spinal cord, perfused with formalin 10 minutes after the injury, can detect changes in water diffusion in white matter (WM) and in gray matter (GM), in areas extending well beyond the region of direct impact. Histology of neurons of the GM shows changes that can be attributed to ischemia. This is in agreement with the observed decrease of diffusion in the injured regions, which may be attributed to the cytotoxic edema due to ischemia. However, the diffusion changes in highly anisotropic WM seem to be caused by a direct action of mechanical force of impact, which significantly distorts the nerve fibers.",

Subjects were exposed to the odor for three consecutive days. Behavioral responses to the toluquinone odor were characterized both by an approach phase of risk assessment and by a repeated series of approach-avoid episodes. Results indicate that toluquinone exposure reduced completely, and in a strain independent fashion, selected behaviors such as crouching, catching and eating object. Other responses were strain-dependent: the DBA (DBA/2J) strain displayed defensive burying at high levels, C57 (C57BL/6J) mice performed high levels of withdrawal while the 129/Sv (129/SvPasIco) strain showed also high levels of stretch attend posture. Compared to other tasks, this test is ethological, simple, cheap and is not affected by strain differences in appetitive-sensory responses, as shown by some strain-independent responses.

The concept of their mechanism of action, however, have essentially undergone an evolution. Previously, these compounds were postulated to regulate neuronal function mainly via allosteric regulation of some membrane-bound receptors, such as GABA(A) and NMDA receptors, in a non-genomic way. Recent studies have provided evidence for intracellular targets for neurosteroids, e.g., transcription factors (NFkappa-B, progesterone receptors), protein inases (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, protein kinase C), or microtubule-associated proteins, i.e. factors essential in regulation of neuronal survival and apoptosis. This paper reviews in vitro and in vivo data on neurosteroid involvement in the regulation of neurodegenerative processes with emphasis on new intracellular and genomic mechanisms of their action. Potential utility of neurosteroids in the treatment of some neurodegenerative disorders has been also discussed.",

We have analysed serum concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-alpha), macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), thyroxine and insulin to elucidate the pathomechanism which may be of importance for the development of central degeneration in cachectic Morris hepatoma bearing rats. Serum TNF-alpha and MCP-1 levels were evaluated by means of the ELISA system, while thyroxine and insulin were estimated by radioimmunoassay. Microscopic examination using hematoxylin-eosin, Nissl and Klüver-Barrera staining revealed an atrophy in the cerebellum, homogenization changes of Purkinje cells and decreased cell density of the granular layer. In the Morris hepatoma bearing animals serum MCP-1 content was elevated while TNF-alpha, thyroxine and insulin concentrations were decreased. This study has demonstrated that circulating TNF-alpha and MCP-1, together with decreased levels of insulin and thyroxine accompany and may produce a milieu of factors involved in mechanisms of the development of cerebellar degeneration in cachectic hepatoma bearing rats.The correspondence should be addressed to S.

CO2 increases oxygen uptake by its influence on the regulation of alveolar ventilation and ventilationperfusion matching, facilitates oxygen delivery to the tissues by changing the affinity of oxygen to hemoglobin, and increases cerebral blood flow by effects on arterial blood pressure and on cerebral vessels. Recent clinical studies show improved brain oxygenation when hypoxia is combined with hypercapnia. Anti-inflammatory and protective against organ injury properties of CO2 may also have therapeutic importance. These biological effects of hypercapnia may improve brain oxygenation under hypoxic conditions. This may be especially important in patients with severe OSA syndrome.",

The presence of the complete machinery required to synthesize cytoplasmic and integral membrane proteins in dendrites, identification of binding proteins known to mediate mRNA trafficking in dendrites and the ability to trigger \"on-site\" translation make it possible for the synthesis of particular proteins to be regulated by synaptic signals. Until now over 100 different mRNAs coding the proteins involved in neurotransmission and modulation of synaptic activity have been identified in dendrites. Local protein synthesis is postulated to provide the basic mechanism of fast changes in the strength of neuronal connections and to be an important factor in the molecular background of synaptic plasticity, giving rise to enduring changes in synaptic function, which in turn play a role in local homeostatic responses. Local protein synthesis points to some autonomy of dendrites which makes them \"the brains of the neurons\" (Jim Eberwine; from the interview with J. Eberwine - Barinaga 2000).",

Although many researchers consider TSE in the blind to be an example of use-dependent plasticity, it is unclear whether the effects of training (Braille reading) are specific, i.e. restricted to the trained function and hand, or if they are more general. To examine this issue further, blind Braille readers, low-vision subjects (Braille readers and non-Braille readers) and sighted controls were tested in two tasks: a texture task resembling the Braille system and a dissimilar groove orientation task. Braille readers, both blind and those with low vision, performed better in both tasks than low-vision non-Braille readers or sighted controls. However, the difference was significant only for the blind (more experienced) Braille readers. In the groove orientation task, the positive influence of training was detectable irrespective of the hand used in the test, but in the coarse texture task this influence was limited to the hand trained in Braille. Thus, it appears that tactile training is of significance in TSE but its effects are, to a large extent, task- and hand-specific.",

Accordingly, post-hoc analysis revealed significantly stronger vMMN in patients with length of MAMP abuse shorter than 5 years than in paired controls.

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate how the processing of auditory stimuli is affected by the simultaneous presentation of visual stimuli. This was approached in an active and passive condition, during which a P3 was elicited in the human EEG by single auditory stimuli. Subjects were presented tones, either alone or accompanied by the simultaneous exposition of pictures. There were two different sessions. In the first, the presented tones demanded no further cognitive activity from the subjects (passive or \"\"ignore\"\" session), while in the second session subjects were instructed to count the tones (active or \"count\" session). The central question was whether inter-modal influences of visual stimulation in the active condition would modulate the auditory P3 in the same way as in the passive condition. Brain responses in the ignore session revealed only a small P3-like component over the parietal and frontal cortex, however, when the auditory stimuli co-occurred with the visual stimuli, an increased frontal activity in the window of 300-500 ms was observed. This could be interpreted as the reflection of a more intensive involuntary attention shift, provoked by the preceding visual stimulation. Moreover, it was found that cognitive load caused by the count instruction, resulted in an evident P3, with maximal amplitude over parietal locations. This effect was smaller when auditory stimuli were presented on the visual background. These findings might support the thesis that available resources were assigned to the analysis of visual stimulus, and thus were not available to analyze the subsequent auditory stimuli. This reduction in allocation of resources for attention was restricted to the active condition only, when the matching of a template with incoming information results in a distinct P3 component. It is discussed whether the putative source of this effect is a change in the activity of the frontal cortex. Correspondence should be addressed to E. Wronka Email: eli@apple.phils.uj.edu.pl",

    "abstract": "Temporal information processing controls many aspects of human mental activity and may be assessed by examining perception of temporal order in the tens of milliseconds time range. Although existing studies suggest an age-related decline in mental abilities, the data on the deterioration of temporal order perception seems inconsistent. Moreover, any evidence on subjects aged over 70 years is lacking. The present experiment aimed to extend the existing data to extremely old people. Temporal order judgment (TOJ) for auditory stimuli was tested across the life span of approx. 80 years, i.e. in young (mean age 22 years), elderly (66 years) and very old (101 years) subjects. Age-related deterioration of performance was observed, with slight changes in elderly subjects and significant deterioration in centenarians which was more distinct in women than in men. The results confirm age-related decrease in temporal resolution which may be explained by slowing of information processing or of a hypothetical internal-timing mechanism. These effects may be influenced by different strategies used in particular age groups.",

We studied the dependence of this phenomenon on the presentation mode (white on black vs. black on white background), and on the figure/ground contrast. We found, as expected, overestimation of the filled part of the figure for both contrast polarities. The expansion effect was found to be an increasing function of the absolute luminance contrast, and was consistently higher for the negative (luminant figures on a dark background) than for the positive polarity. The contrast factor contributes from one-fifth to one-third of the total effect. Possible interpretations in terms of known sensory phenomena (irradiation, lateral interactions) or higher, integrative functions are discussed.",

In addition, we found hiPS-cells without neuronal differentiation and cells already expressing betaIII-tubulin but not having yet distinctive axonal and dendritic processes. Human neuronal progenitors, starting neuronal differentiation, were contacted by both neuronal processes from rat neurons and oligodendrocytes, indicating a possible instructive influence by the primary culture on human cells. After 7 days of co-cultivation, however, we observed a complete degeneration of human iPS-derived cells and phagocytosis by microglial cells. Immunocytochemical stainings surprisingly revealed that microglial cells of the cortical primary culture express both CD8 and T-cell receptors.",

We examined whether early haloperidol administration to Wistar-Albino-Glaxo dams from Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) and in Wistar control rats would affect maternal care and as a consequence, seizure susceptibility and behavior in the WAG/Rij's offspring at 3-4 months of age. Nursing dams of this well-validated genetic animal model of absence epilepsy and control dams were injected with haloperidol or saline at PPD 1 to 6. Maternal behavior was evaluated at PPD 7 to 9. Haloperidol-injected WAG/Rij dams showed more pup carryings compared with saline-injected mothers, this effect was not noticed in control Wistar dams. The offspring of haloperidol-treated WAG/Rij dams, tested during adulthood, showed heightened behavioral activity (time spent into the open arms, head dips) in the elevated plus-maze, as well as shorter spike-wave discharges (SWD) as measured in their electroencephalographic activity compared with saline-treated rats. Overall, it can be concluded that deviancies in the DA system as induced by haloperidol facilitates pup carrying/retrieval behavior in WAG/Rij rats and reduces seizure activity of the offspring in adulthood. Therefore, inter-individual differences in seizure properties and behavior in genetically predisposed animals may be due to differences in maternal behavior of the dams.",

Clinically the syndrome is characterized by motor alterations that are treated by the oral administration of levodopa. However, this treatment typically loses efficacy over time and therefore new treatments that procure a steady long term supplement of dopamine are needed. Here we tested the expression of a tyrosine hydroxilase (TH) transgene in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treated primates own astrocytes. The transgene, whose expression of TH cDNA was controlled by a glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter, was injected into MPTP treated primate's brains using liposomes as a delivery system. Monkeys were tested before and after MPTP administration, and after gene therapy treatment on the HALLWAY behavioral task. Results showed both transgene expression and significant behavioral improvements in the hallway task after the TH cDNA transfer. The behavioral recovery observed in the primates whose astrocytes expressed rat TH, is a first step that warrant further studies using primate's astrocytes as a good cell lineage to express therapeutic molecules.",

In particular, the role of the amygdala in processing of negative emotions and aversive learning has been shown in numerous studies. However, involvement of this structure in processing of positive affect and appetitive learning is not fully understood. Previous experiments in animals are not consistent. While some authors implicate only the centromedial part of the amygdala in appetitive learning, the others suggest contribution of both centromedial and basolateral subregions. Although from the evolutionary perspective appetitive learning is equally important as aversive learning, research on the role of the human amygdala and its subregions in appetitive learning is undertaken relatively rarely and the results are not conclusive. Therefore, the aim of this review is twofold: to summarize the current knowledge in this field and to indicate and discuss the factors, which might affect the observed level of the amygdala activity during appetitive learning in humans.",

This study examined the influence of acute and chronic forced swim (FS) or high-light open field (HL‑OF) stimulation on the density of BDNF immunoreactive (ir) neurons in the hippocampal pyramidal layers of CA1, CA2, CA3 regions and the granular layer of dentate gyrus (DG) in old (postnatal day 720; P720) Wistar Han rats. Our data showed that in comparison with non-stressed rats, acute FS caused a significant increase in the density of BDNF-ir neurons in CA2 and CA3, while acute HL-OF led to an increase in this factor in all hippocampal subfields with the exception of DG. However, the density of BDNF-ir cells remained unchanged after exposure to chronic FS or HL‑OF in the hippocampal regions in relation to the control rats. These results indicate that acute FS or HL-OF proved to be a stressor that induces an increase in the density of BDNF-ir pyramidal neurons, which was probably connected with up-regulation of HPA axis activity and short‑time memory processing of the stressful situation. Moreover, as far as the influence on BDNF-ir cells in hippocampus is concerned, chronic FS or HL-OF was not an aggravating factor for rats in the ontogenetic periods studied.",

Sixteen healthy young males were subjected to sudden rotations of the standing platform. The vision and cognition during the standing were also interfered. Motion capturing was used to measure the lower limb joints and the CoM displacements. The CoM path length as a linear parameter was increased by elimination of vision (p<0.01) and adding a cognitive load (p<0.01). The CoM nonlinear metric FD was decreased due to the cognitive loads (p<0.001). The visual interference increased the FD of all joints when the task included the cognitive loads (p<0.01). The slightly positive LLE values showed weakly-chaotic behavior of the whole body. The local joint rotations indicated higher LLEs. Results indicated weakly chaotic response of the whole body. Increase in the task difficulty by adding sensory interference had difference effects on parameters. Linear and nonlinear metrics of the perturbed stance showed that a combination of them may properly represent the body behavior.",

The important processes observed and diagnosed in depressed patients indicate that the etiology of depression may include disturbances in thyroid hormone (TH) levels and the occurrence of immune-inflammatory activation. Type 1 (DIO1) and type 3 (DIO3) iodothyronine deiodinases are the enzymes which determine the peripheral and tissue levels of TH, but also interfere with immunological cells and inflammatory processes. We aimed to investigate the levels of DIO1 and DIO3 in the patients suffering from recurrent depressive disorders (rDD). Data collected from 91 rDD patients and 105 healthy controls were analyzed. The diagnoses were made based on the ICD-10 criteria (F33.0-F33.8). The expression levels of DIO1 and DIO3 were estimated using the polymerase chain reaction method and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of DIO1 on mRNA/protein levels in the rDD patients was reduced in comparison to the control subjects, while the expression of DIO3 was higher in the patients suffering from depression. No significant relationship was found between the investigated DIOs and other clinical parameters. Our results indicate and suggest a role of DIO1 and DIO3-related pathways in the pathophysiology of depression. The results represent a promising way to investigate the biological markers of depression.",

In many cases, reducing body temperature can prevent febrile seizure. Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 8 (TRPM8) is a cation channel that is involved in body thermoregulation. It was reported that M8‑B, a TRPM8 antagonist, can reduce body temperature. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effect of M8‑B on different experimental seizure models. Eight‑day‑old male Wistar rat pups were used for induction of febrile seizure. M8‑B and diazepam were injected intraperitoneally. The rat pups were then transferred to a heated plexiglas chamber and the latency to the first febrile seizure was measured. In addition, different groups of mice were pretreated with M8‑B and received a convulsant dose of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). Latencies to stages 2 and 4 and duration of stage 5 seizure episodes were measured. Furthermore, the effect of M8‑B on electroshock‑induced seizures was also investigated and hindlimb extension time was measured. The results showed that M8‑B decreased the body temperature of rat pups and increased the latency to the first febrile seizure, implying a significant protective effect. It also induced a significant anticonvulsant effect in PTZ ‑ but not electroshock‑induced convulsions. M8‑B showed anticonvulsant effects in both febrile‑ and PTZ‑induced seizures. M8‑B had a hypothermic effect with significant protective effects on febrile‑ and PTZ‑induced seizures; however, it did not produce similarly protective effects on seizures induced by electroshock.",

Therefore, using electroencephalography (EEG), we studied the time course and patterns of changes in brain activity associated with purely mental processes which start on their own, without an external or interoceptive stimulation. We compared EEG recordings for decisions to perform mental operations on numbers, imagined finger movements, and actual finger movements. In all three cases, we found striking similarities in slow negative shifts of brain electrical activity lasting around 1 s and, therefore, characteristic for readiness potential. These results show that the brain not only needs time to be ready for a purely mental task but also that a required preparatory interval involves neural changes analogical to the ones observed before intentional body movements. As such, the readiness potential represents a universal process of unconscious preparatory brain activity preceding any, including purely mental, voluntary action.",

We found significant dependence of the effect magnitude on a number of filling elements as well as on their form.

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disease characterized by recurrent seizures that affects about 70 million people worldwide. Antiepileptic drugs are the most commonly used medications in the treatment of epilepsy. They help control seizures in about 60-70% of people. The remaining percentage of patients suffer from drug-resistant epilepsy, prompting scientists to look for natural substances that would prevent seizures or support the effects of drugs in add-on therapy while reducing side effects. Currently, there is a lot of emphasis on natural product. Flavonoids are included in this group, and their use in the treatment of epilepsy could support the effect of other drugs. Due to very good results of preclinical studies, flavonoids are a promising candidate for epilepsy related clinical trials related. The article is an overview of literature reports from the past 10 years including mainly in vivo preclinical research on various models of experimental epilepsy with the use of selected flavonoids.",

    "abstract": "Umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived stem/progenitor cells (SPCs) have demonstrated the potential to improve neurologic function in different experimental models. SPCs can survive after transplantation in the neural microenvironment and indu ce neuroprotection, endogenous neurogenesis by secreting a broad repertoire of trophic and immunomodulatory cytokines. In this study, the influence of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) pre-treatment was comprehensively evaluated in a UCB-derived lineage-negative (Lin−) SPC population. UCB-derived Lin− cells were evaluated with respect to the expression of (i) neuronal markers using immunofluorescence staining and (ii) specific (TrkB) receptors for BDNF using flow cytometry. Next, after BDNF pre-treatment, Lin− cells were extensively assessed with respect to apoptosis using Western blotting and proliferation via BrdU incorporation. Furthermore, NT-3 expression levels in Lin− cells using RQ PCR and antioxidative enzyme activities were assessed. We demonstrated neuronal markers as well as TrkB expression in Lin− cells and the activation of the TrkB receptor by BDNF. BDNF pre-treatment diminished apoptosis in Lin− cells and influenced the proliferation of these cells. We observed significant changes in antioxidants as well as in the increased expression of NT-3 in Lin− cells following BDNF exposure. Complex global miRNA and mRNA profiling analyses using microarray technology and GSEA revealed the differential regulation of genes involved in the proliferation, gene expression, biosynthetic processes, translation, and protein targeting. Our results support the hypothesis that pre-treatment of stem/progenitor cells could be beneficial and may be used as an auxiliary strategy for improving the properties of SPCs.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the MMP inhibitor GM6001 in a rat model of S. pneumoniae meningitis. For these experiments, 7-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into an uninfected group, meningitis group, antibiotic group and GM6001+antibiotic group. Uninfected animals were sham infected with sterile saline. Rats in the other three groups were inoculated with S. pneumoniae and left untreated, treated with ceftriaxone, or treated with ceftriaxone combined with GM6001. Rats in the meningitis group were severely ill, and MMP-9 was significantly up-regulated. The change in brain water content was consistent with the MMP-9 level. A significant loss of neurons and impaired learning function were observed in the meningitis group. Treatment with the antibiotic and GM6001 significantly down-regulated the level of MMP-9, decreased the brain water content, attenuated neuronal injury and improved learning. Conclusions: GM6001 protected the brain from damage caused by S. pneumoniae, and this effect may occur via downregulating MMP-9 and decreasing brain water content.",

There are reports that brief exposure of neurons to NMDA-receptor antagonists may be an adequate preconditioning stressor. We studied effects of preconditioning of the cerebellar granule cells (CGC) in primary culture by 30-minute exposure to NMDA receptor antagonists 0.5 microM MK-801 or 5 microM memantine. CGC were challenged with oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) or excitotoxic glutamate and cell viability was tested 24 h later using calcein/ethidium homodimer-1 staining. We studied glutamate-induced increases in 45Ca uptake and in the intracellular Ca2+ level assessed with the fluorescent probe fluo-3. The number of living cells In OGD-treated cultures decreased by 42 percent. Preconditioning with MK-801 or memantine 24 h earlier reduced cell death to 8 percent and 30 percent and 48 h earlier to 27percent and 33 percent, respectively. Pretreatment with MK-801 followed by the standard MK-801 wash out was slightly cytoprotective in a glutamate excitotoxicity test performed immediately; the protection increased significantly 24 h after preconditioning. In both cases the extensive wash out of MK-801 after preconditioning resulted in loss of cytoprotection. The increase in the intracellular Ca2+ level evoked by glutamate was decreased 24 h after preconditioning and even halved in the neuronal cultures 48 h after preconditioning with MK-801 and memantine. Glutamate-induced 45Ca uptake in these cells was decreased by 18 percent, irrespective of the time laps after preconditioning. These results demonstrate that preconditioning of CGC with NMDA receptor antagonists induces prolonged tolerance to OGD, which is accompanied by the reduction of glutamate-evoked calcium fluxes. The causal relationship between these effects may be suggested.",

    "abstract": "One of the hypotheses on the origin of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) stems from a close relation between a re-activation of a cell-cycle in post-mitotic neurons and a neural cells death observed in pathologically affected parts of AD brains. In the normal, healthy brain almost all neural cells are terminally differentiated and “locked” in the G0 phase of the cell-cycle. For these cells, the consequence of the re-entry to the cell-cycle is targeting them towards cellular divisions and turning on the apoptotic pathway. We used an RNA interference (RNAi) methodology in neural cells to switch-off genes for two cyclindependent kinases 4 and 6 (cdk4, cdk6), which control the activation of the initial steps of the cell-cycle. As a result, some evidences are delivered that silencing these genes, which are expressed during cell proliferation but inhibited at mature neurons, prevents the stimulation of apoptotic pathways in the neural cells cultured in a oxidative stress conditions and may have a neuroprotective effect. We demonstrate that down-regulation of genes important in the G1 phase of the cell-cycle may play the protective function on the neuronal cells, and can be considered as the promising approach for the potential gene therapy of neurodegenerative diseases.",

Genetic variability of G894T and intronic 4ab polymorphism in eNOS could affect the expression and activity of eNOS enzyme, modulating NO levels in endothelium. This results in endothelial dysfunction, which can contribute to the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the association of eNOS genetic polymorphisms (G894T and 4ab) with the occurrence of ischemic stroke through various genetic models. Both polymorphisms were genotyped in 120 ischemic stroke patients diagnosed with MRI and other ancillary techniques and 101 control subjects free of neurological abnormalities, using PCR-RFLP technique and direct PCR respectively. The genotypes of both G894T and 4ab variants were found to be in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium for cases and controls. The significant variation was observed in the genotypic and allelic frequencies for G894T polymorphism between cases and controls, indicating the association of G894T variability with ischemic stroke. However, the difference between cases and controls was insignificant for eNOS 4ab polymorphism with regard to genotypic and allelic distribution. Except for recessive model, both dominant (GT/TT vs. GG) and co-dominant (TT vs. GT or GT vs. GG) models indicated nearly two-fold and 1.93 increased risk of ischemic stroke for G894T polymorphism, but none of them suggested the influence of eNOS 4ab polymorphism on ischemic stroke susceptibility. Haplotype analysis revealed the higher frequency of GT-4bb genotype combination in cases as compared to controls, but without significant difference. The study concluded that SNP G894T variant is associated with ischemic stroke and might contribute to ischemic stroke susceptibility in North Indians. However, this outcome needs to be confirmed by studies with large sample size.",

However, this task was learned by neurologically intact animals, bulbectomized animals, and rats with lesions exclusively centered in the CeA area alone. These results suggest that the CeA area may be relevant in gustatory-gut associative learning but not in FAL, in which the olfactory system may counteract the deficit produced in taste-visceral convergence.",

In the somatic model of pain, we established the influence of selective inhibitors of neuronal and inducible nitric oxide synthase on the antihyperalgesic effects of magnesium sulfate and dizocilpine. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to determine in the rat model of visceral pain whether same mechanisms are involved in the antinociceptive action of magnesium sulfate and dizocilpine. Analgesic activity was assessed using the acetic acid-induced writhing test in rats. Subcutaneous injection of either magnesium sulfate (15 mg/kg) or dizocilpine (0.01 mg/kg) decreased the number of writhes by about 60 and 70%, respectively. The role of nitric oxide on the effects of magnesium sulfate and dizocilpine was evaluated using selective inhibitor of neuronal (N-ω-Propyl-L-arginine hydrochloride (L-NPA)) and inducible (S-methylisothiourea (SMT)) nitric oxide synthase, which per se did not affect the number of writhes. We observed that the antinociceptive effect of magnesium sulfate or dizocilpine did not change in the presence of L-NPA (2 and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) and SMT (0.015 and 10 mg/kg, i.p.). We conclude that, nitric oxide produced by neuronal and inducible nitric oxide synthase does not modulate the effects of magnesium sulfate and dizocilpine in the visceral inflammatory model of pain in the rat.",

    "abstract": "Excessive excitation or loss of inhibitory neurotransmission has been closely related to epileptic activity. Somatostatin (SST) and Neuropeptide Y (NPY) are members of endogenous neuropeptides which are recognized as important modulator of classical neurotransmitter, distributed abundantly in mammalian central nervous system. Abnormal expression of these two neuropeptides evidenced in some epileptic models highlights the relevance of SST or NPY in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. The tremor rat (TRM) is a genetic epileptic animal model which can manifest tonic convulsions without any external stimuli. The present study aimed to investigate the distribution and expression of SST and NPY in TRM brains, including hippocampus, temporal lobe cortex and cerebellum. Our RT‑PCR data showed that up-regulated mRNA expression of SST and NPY was discovered in TRM hippocampus and temporal lobe cortex compared with control (Wistar) rats. The peptide levels of these neuropeptides in brain areas mentioned above were both apparently higher than that in normal Wistar rats as well. However, in cerebellums, neither SST nor NPY was significantly changed compared with control group. The immunohistochemical data showed that SST and NPY were widely present throughout CA1, CA3 and the hilus of hippocampus, the entorhinal cortex of temporal lobe cortex, as well as cerebellar Purkinje layer. In conclusion, our results discovered the aberrant changes of SST and NPY in several TRM brain regions, suggesting that the peptidergic system might be involved in TRM epileptiform activity.",

However, the protective mechanisms of PA in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion have been not fully determined. This investigation aims to explore the neuroprotective role of PA in ischemia/reperfusion via miR‑155/NRF2/HO‑1 axis. The N2a cell line was induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) to simulate the neuronal damage that occurs during cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. PA was used to treat H/R‑induced N2a cells. An MTT assay was used to determine cell viability. The protein levels of Bcl‑2, Bax, heme oxygenase‑1 (HO‑1) and nuclear factor E2‑related factor 2 (NRF2) were measured via Western blot analysis. The level of apoptosis of N2a cells was determined by flow cytometry. The expression levels of miR‑155 and NRF2 were quantified by real‑ti me PCR. PA treatment inhibits the increase in apoptosis induced by H/R and also enhances the viability of cells exposed to H/R. PA reverses the increased expression of miR‑155 caused by H/R. Furthermore, H/R does not change the expression of HO‑1 and NRF2, but PA upregulates the expressions of HO‑1 and NRF2. Additionally, NRF2 is the target of miR‑155. Inhibiting miR‑155 contributes to increased cell viability and decreased apoptosis via targeting the NRF2/HO‑1 pathway. Overall, PA prevents neuronal cell damage induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation via miR‑155/ NRF2/HO‑1 axis.",

In particular, 4‑aminopyridine (4‑AP) has been used as a model of generalized seizures. 4‑AP is a K+ channel blocker, but its mechanism of action has not yet been fully described; some evidence has shown that it acts on the K+ channel types Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.4 and Kv4, which are localized in the axonic terminals of pyramidal neurons and interneurons. When 4‑AP blocks the K+ channels it triggers depolarization and prolongs the action potential in the neuron, which causes nonspecific neurotransmitter release. Among these neurotransmitters, glutamate is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter released in the hippocampus. Once glutamate is released, it reaches its ionotropic and metabotropic receptors continuing the neuronal depolarization chain and propagation of hyperexcitability. This brief review is focused on the use of 4‑AP as an effective seizure model for testing antiseizure drugs in relevant in vitro and in vivo studies.",

    "abstract": "Sensory gating in rats can be measured with a double click paradigm. The diminished response towards the second click is a physiological manifestation of reduced sensory input. This physiological process seems to be disturbed in human psychoses. It is thought that gating, as measured with this paradigm, is a preattentive, involuntary phenomenon which is not modulated by attention. If this is indeed the case, than it is hypothesized that gating should not be modulated by non-REM sleep. In the present experiment pairs of clicks (500 ms interval) were presented during wakefulness, non-REM as well as REM sleep and cortical auditory evoked potentials (AEP's) were recorded in chronically implanted rats. Rather similar AEP's were found after the first and second stimulus. However, the amplitudes of the various components of the second AEP were smaller than those of the first AEP, suggesting a gated response. This was the case during all three levels of vigilance. The amplitudes of both AEP's showed the more often reported changes in amplitude during sleep and REM sleep. Clear differences were seen in gating: compared to wakefulness a decrease in gating was found during REM sleep while gating was unchanged during non-REM sleep. The latter outcome seems to confirm that gating in rats is indeed a preattentive process. Finally, results were discussed in terms of neuronal properties of thalamic relay cells and it is suggested that firing properties of thalamic relay cells are not involved in this type of sensory gating.",

    "abstract": "The influence of compounds interacting with cholinergic systems on field potentials evoked in layer II/III horizontal connections was investigated in rat motor cortex in vitro. The cholinesterase inhibitor eserine (10 microM) decreased field responses by 20 +/- 2%. This effect could be prevented by preincubation with atropine (10 microM). Application of 5 microM carbachol resulted in reduction of the responses by 30 +/- 1%. These reductions were reversible, repeatable and independent of stimulus intensity; they could be blocked by the M1 muscarinic receptor antagonist pirenzepine (3 microM) but not by the M2 muscarinic receptor antagonist gallamine (10 microM). During carbachol application, paired-pulse facilitation (40 ms interpulse interval) was increased. The results indicate that endogenous acetylcholine may modulate excitatory synaptic transmission in horizontal connections of rat motor cortex, most likely by acting upon M1 receptors located presynaptically on glutamatergic terminals, and may contribute both to information processing and synaptic plasticity within the motor cortex.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of inducible transcription factors (ITFs) expression is often applied to map drug-induced changes of neuronal activity in brain. Administration of cocaine and alcohol induces ITFs in a large number of brain structures. However, induction of ITFs in a brain region does not necessarily indicate a pharmacological effect of the drug in this brain region. Many of the brain regions could be activated by secondary effects. Perception of stimulus properties of the drug or locomotor effects of the drug are possible secondary effects. Anesthesia can block induction of ITFs by cocaine and alcohol suggesting that ITF expression in a majority of brain regions is more sensitive to secondary effects than to pharmacological effects of these drugs. In agreement with this hypothesis is our finding that the majority of brain regions responding with ITF expression to alcohol administration do not respond to voluntary alcohol self-administration in animals. Only a few brain regions show similar ITF induction after both administration and self-administration of this drug. Presumably these brain regions could be responding to pharmacological effects of alcohol. Given the low resolution of invasive techniques, ITF mapping experiments will continually contribute to our understanding of mechanisms of drug addiction and alcoholism.",

To assess the possible involvement of nerve growth factor (NGF) in the phenomenon we evaluated the presumable changes in the expression pattern of NGF immunoreactivity (NGF-IR) in rat hippocampus 21 days after administration of TMT (8 mg/kg, i.p.) when reactive changes are fully developed. Immunolabelling for TrkA known to mediate biological effects of NGF and for GFAP to identify astroglial cells as a one of presumed source of postinjury produced factors was carried out on adjacent sections to establish the relation between expression of these proteins. In control hippocampus NGF-IR and TrkA-IR were localized in neurons and/or neuropil. After exposure to TMT remarkable non-neuronal expression of both proteins was observed. The distribution pattern of NGF, TrkA and GFAP overlapped suggesting that reactive astrocytes may not only produce NGF but also may become responsive to this neurotrophin. Zones of extensive NGF and TrkA astroglial expression corresponded to areas of axonal-dendritic rearrangements reported earlier. The data suggest that astroglia-derived trophic activity may be involved in neuronal plastic events associated with treatment with TMT.",

In adult animals only potentiation of spared vibrissae responses was detected. Suppression exhibits hetero- and homosynaptic components and appears to be cortical in origin, as is potentiation. The time course for potentiation and suppression in the barrel cortex of adolescent rats is different, with suppression preceeding potentiation by at least one week. There seems to be no critical period for potentiation in superficial layers of barrel cortex, but there is a critical period for suppression. Suppression cannot be evoked if plasticity is induced later than at 6 months of age nor maintained if experimental manipulations begin later than at three months. The molecular mechanisms that underlie plastic changes in the barrel cortex still remain unclear, although alpha-CamKII and to lesser extend alpha/beta-CREB appear to be involved.",

    "abstract": "Locomotor training leads to improvement of stepping ability in animals after spinal cord transection (1). Recent data point to neurotrophins as possible factors involved in this improvement. Motoneurones synthesising BDNF, NT-4 and NT-3 are a potent source of neurotrophins for the spinal network (2, 3). Physical exercise increases BDNF neurotrophin gene expression in the rat hippocampus (4). If exercise enhances BDNF expression also in the spinal cord, upregulation of its receptor Trk B may occur. To verify this hypothesis we tested whether exercise influences TrkB receptor system in the spinal cord. Six adult, male Wistar rats walked on the treadmill five days a week, 1,000 m daily with the speed of 20 to 25 cm/s. After 4 weeks of training animals were anaesthetised with pentobarbital sodium (80 mg/kg b.w.) and perfused with 0.01 M PBS followed by 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% parabenzoquinone in 0.1 M PB. Three non-trained animals were used as controls. Cryostat 40 microns sections were processed free-floating with TrkB polyclonal antibody (1:1,000, Santa Cruz) and ABC Vectastain detection system. Sections were examined under Nikon light microscope and analysed with Image-Pro Plus 4 software.TrkB immunoreactivity (IR) was detected in number of spinal cells at the lumbar level in non-trained animals (Fig. 1A). The strongest IR appeared in the perikarya and processes of small diameter cells rarely scattered in the grey and white matter. The average area of these cells was 50 micron 2 (+/- 10). Exercise increased by over 50% the number of TrkB immunostained small cells (Fig. 1B). An enhancement of perikaryonal immunostaining of these cells was also observed (Fig. 1B, inset). Testing the identity of Trk B IR small diameter cells did not prove their astroglial (GFAP IR) and gabaergic (GAD IR) phenotype in the grey matter. Some of TrkB IR cells in the white matter were astrocytes. Our data point to physical exercise as a potent method to make spinal cells more receptive to neurotrophic stimuli.",

    "abstract": "We review the crucial role of the two neurotransmitters norepinephrine (NE) and GABA in eliciting GnRH pulse. NE acts via an alpha l-receptor mechanism and also GABA acts at the alpha-subtype of the GABA receptor. The function of NE appears to be induction of phasic activation of GnRH neurons and GABA inhibits GnRH neurons tonically until they are all ready for phasic activation. By an unknown mechanism preoptic GABA release in dramatically reduced which causes simultaneous desinhibition of the GnRH neurons. Hence they release their product into the portal vessels simultaneously which is the appropriate signal for the pituitary ganodotrophs. The action of norepinephrine and GABA is most likely exerted at the perikarya level of the GnRH neurons since the alpha l-adreno receptor blocker doxazosin and GABA inhibit GnRH secretion only when applied into the medial preoptic/anterior hypothalamic area (where in the rat brain the GnRH perikarya are located). Utilizing a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, we demonstrate furthermore that GnRH receptors are present in the mediobasal hypothalamus as well as in the preoptic area of rats. Their function appears to serve autoinhibitory purposes since Buserelin added to medium significantly decreased GnRH release. Simultaneously, the release of GABA was increased and that of glutamate decreased. We conclude from these experiments that GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in the hypothalamus may also be GnRH-receptive.",

The long-term restriction of protein in the diet elicited: enhancing irSS content in periventricular perikarya; diminishing irSS stores in the median eminence and elevating the number ir somatotrophs and content of irGH. NPY infusions enhanced the content of irSS in perikarya in sheep fed on E diet and diminished the number of ir somatotrophs and content of irGH of sheep fed on R diet. The R diet as well as NPY infusions caused an increase in GH mean concentrations in the blood plasma. Obtained results suggest that stimulatory effect of restricted feeding and/or NPY action on GH secretion can be due to attenuated SS output. Since dietary restrictions and exogenous NPY have similar influence on the activation of GH secretion, we suggest that NPY could be a neuromodulatory link between nutritional cues and somatotropic axis in sheep.",

Thus far, our in vitro studies provided strong evidence that the in vitro recorded theta oscillations replicate many physiological and pharmacological properties of the in vivo observed theta rhythm.

The purpose of this study was to assess the function of nerve ending particles after acute lead exposure and to investigate whether it exerts a toxic effect on astroglial functions. The studies were performed using the rodent model of acute lead toxicity. Cellular fractions were used in biochemical measurements--synaptosomes and glial plasmalemmal vesicles (GPV). Since a procedure for the isolation of the fraction of astroglial origin has been developed, it becomes possible to investigate lead-astroglia interactions after in vivo exposure. It is of importance because most of the studies concerning lead toxicity were performed using astroglial culture systems. It was found that the uptake of glutamate (Glu) to the synaptosomes was lowered and KCl-dependent release was increased, suggesting the impairment of glutamatergic transmission leading to the elevation of extracellular amino acid concentration. In contrast, glutamate uptake to the GPV fraction was significantly elevated. The activity of the marker enzyme--glutamine synthetase (GS) was also significantly increased in the GPV fraction. The activation of glial functions suggest a regulatory role for these cells in the early period of acute lead toxicity.",

Activation of protein binding to NF kappa B consensus oligonucleotide was determined by electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay (EMSA) in homogenates from dorsal (DP- an equivalent of CA1 sector) and abdominal (AbP- containing CA2-4 and gyrus dentatus) parts of hippocampus. A significant activation of NF kappa B binding was observed exclusively in DP as early as 3 h after ischemia and at this time that response preceded any other morphological signs of postischemic tissue injury. This early enhancement of NF kappa B binding was followed by microglia activation visualized in CA1 pyramidal region at 24 h of recovery by histochemical staining with lectin from Ricinus communis (RCA-120). Simultaneously, only a moderate increase of immunostaining against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was observed homogeneously in all parts of hippocampus. This uniform pattern of astrogliosis was preserved until postischemic day 3-4, when apoptotic DNA fragmentation in CA1 pyramidal neurons had been clearly documented by TUNEL staining. At this period however, continuous elevation of NF kappa B binding in DP corresponded with similar response manifested also in AbP of the hippocampus. These results evidence a preferential NF kappa B involvement in an early microglia activation in the apoptogenic CA1 sector, although its role in a later astrocytic response to ischemia could not be neglected too.",

Starting from the hypothesis that synchronization and decoupling of cortical γ-activities (35-90 Hz) define the relations among visual objects, we concentrate on synchronization related to (1) static retinal stimulation during ocular fixation, and (2) transient stimulation by sudden shifts in object position. The synchronization hypothesis has been tested by analyzing signal correlations in visual cortex of monkeys with the following results: Static retinal stimuli induce loosely phase-coupled γ-activities among neurons of an object's cortical representation. Patches of γ-synchronization become decoupled across the representation of an object's contour, and therby can code figure-ground segregation. Transient stimuli evoke synchronized volleys of stimulus-locked activities that are typically non-rhythmic and include low frequency components in addition to those in the γ-range. It is argued that stimulus-induced and stimulus-locked synchronizations may play different roles in perceptual feature grouping.",

Locomotion activity showed a decreasing tendency within age according to a linear dependence in 3, 12 and 24 months old rats. Neurochemical data showed the decreased activity of NA system and increased activity of DA system in most structures already occurred in 12 months old rats. It remained at the same level in aged rats. The correlation analysis between the behavioral markers of fear level and distribution of monoamines in young, mature and aged rats showed diversified data, only some of them being consistent with the \"serotonergic hypothesis\" of fear/anxiety.

It was suggested that the Sgt1 protein plays a role in the CBF3 kinetochore and the SCF ubiquitin ligase complexes. Since the distribution, properties and functions of the mammalian Sgt1 have not been extensively studied, we examined the expression of Sgt1 protein in the rat tissues and here we report the preliminary results. Using northern and western blots we found that the Sgt1 protein is expressed in various tissues and that brain, skeletal muscles and spleen contain high levels of this protein and its mRNA. Then, by western blot, we checked the localization of Sgt1 in some areas of the rat brain such as cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus and we found that cerebellum and cortex contain highest amounts of this protein. Using immunohistochemistry we found that the Sgt1 protein is present in both neurons and glial cells.",

To investigate mechanisms of this compensatory plasticity we followed changes in the brain's pattern of activation evoked by stimulation of vibrissae, after a focal cortical stroke which destroyed the cortical representation of vibrissae, the barrel cortex. The pattern of brain activation was visualized with [14C]-2-doexyglucose (2DG) autoradiography in rats 7 days after photothrombotic stroke. During isotope incorporation, vibrissae contralateral to stroke were stimulated. In control rats this stimulation activates the barrel cortex and the second somatosensory cortex in the contralateral hemisphere. Seven days after stroke in the barrel cortex, significant increases in activation were found in ipsilateral, uninjured hemisphere in the barrel cortex and anterior vibrissae representation, and also in regions not specifically connected to vibrissae stimulation, such as motor and auditory cortex. Shortly after cortical stroke, the intact hemisphere shows higher metabolic activation in several cortical regions, possibly due to abnormal interactions with the injured hemisphere.",

GCs potentiate stress or ischemia-induced accumulation of excitatory amino acids in the extracellular space of hippocampus. The antagonism of glutamate receptors may potentially improve safety profile of therapy with GCs. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of dizocilpine maleate (MK-801), non-competitive NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist, on neurotoxic effect of the prolonged treatment with the high dose of DEX. The results showed that DEX (120 mg/kg/day for 7 days) impaired the long-term memory and the motor coordination, reduced the body weight and induced the lethality of mice. The morphological and ultrastructural study have confirmed damage to hippocampal neurons especially in the CA3 region after the prolonged treatment with DEX alone. Damaged pyramidal neurons showed robust changes in the shape of the nucleus and cytoplasm condensation. MK-801 alone (at non-toxic dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day), changed neither the behavior of mice nor morphology of the hippocampal neurons. However, it did not prevent the neurotoxic effects of DEX. On the contrary, it intensified DEX-induced neurotoxicity.",

In addition to inhibitory avoidance learning, anxiety and locomotor activity were measured in the same animals using an elevated plus-maze. A study of the acute effects of maprotiline (15, 20 or 25 mg/kg) on analgesia was carried out in naive animals of both sexes. Maprotiline impaired inhibitory avoidance at doses of 15, 20 or 25 mg/kg. The highest dose produced an anxiolytic effect in females, and the doses of 20 and 25 mg/kg reduced locomotor activity. Analgesia was observed with the highest dose. The impairment of inhibitory avoidance by maprotiline would seem to be independent of the drug's influence on anxiety, is not shadowed by an instrumental performance deficit and, at least in the case of the highest dose, could be influenced by the drug's effects on analgesia. It is hypothesized that acquisition is the memory process principally affected by maprotiline, and in particular stimuli processing. The lack of sex differences in the effects of maprotiline on inhibitory avoidance supports the generalization of findings previously obtained only in males.",

To quantify tetanic potentiation, a coefficient TPC (tetanic potentiation coefficient) was defined as a ratio of the areas below tetanic force recording corresponding to the single stimulus contribution and that of the single twitch. Single MUs (27 Slow, 71 Fast, Fatigue Resistant, and 47 Fast, Fatigable) were isolated from the rat medial gastrocnemius muscle (MG) by ventral root splitting. TPC value was rate-dependent, with the maximum TPCmax at a certain optimal rate. The largest values of the TPCmax were obtained in the weakest and most fatigue resistant (S and weak FR) MUs. The different manifestation of staircase effect, post-tetanic and tetanic potentiation in individual MU types indicates that these phenomena may be independent of each other. We suggest that these phenomena as well as the fatigue resistance should be reexamined with protocols adjusted to the MU optimal frequency.",

The magnitudes of ASR, similarly as hot-plate latencies, differed between the lines in the rank order HA is greater than unselected controls (C) greater than LA. The animals’ nociception did not change after the ASR session consisting of a sequence of 20 acoustic stimuli. Morphine hydrochloride (5 and 10 mg per kg i.p.) increased hot-plate latencies in the order of HA greater than C greater than LA, and was not effective on ASR magnitude in HA as well as in C mice. In the LA line, 10 mg per kg of morphine slightly attenuated ASR, but caused only a little analgesia. We conclude that (1) the difference in ASR between the selected lines is inversely correlated with the difference in pain sensitivity; (2) the magnitude of ASR is not altered by morphine analgesia; (3) the procedure of ASR using brief acoustic pulses is not stressful enough to elicit a form of stress analgesia. The lack of a direct relationship between the readiness to startle and pain sensation may be beneficial for an animal’s survival in dangerous situations. It is beneficial when the startle to a warning signal precedes defensive behaviors and it often must be effectuated in a state of decreased nociception.",

The time course of changes in CaBPs expression during maturation of the selected nuclei indicates their diversity. During the first month after birth, CaBPs expression stabilizes earliest in the anterior cortical and then in the medial nuclei. Later, during the second month of postnatal life, the posteromedial and posterolateral cortical nuclei maturate. The central nucleus requires a considerably longer time to reach maturity - about three months are needed to stabilize CaBPs expression in all its subdivisions. This nucleus also shows the most differentiated, time-dependent distribution of CaBPs immunoreactivity (especially CB), distinct in its divisions. The differences in the CaBPs immunoreactivity confirm previous reports concerning dissimilar origin and development, and also reflect the diversity of connectivity of the amygdaloid body - the collection of nuclei, considered as one functional integrity.",

This study examined the influence of chronic exposure to forced swim (FS) stress or high-light open-field (HL-OF) stress on interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). The total level of IL-1beta protein was assessed by Western blot analysis of hippocampal extracts. Double immunofluorescence staining was used to reveal the percentage of IL-1beta/NeuN (NeuN - neuronal marker) cells in the CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) hippocampal subfields. Juvenile (P28; P - postnatal day) and middle-aged (P360) rats were used in the experiment. The research showed no significant differences in IL-1beta protein levels between P28 and P360 non-stress rats. However, a substantial increase in the percentage of IL-1beta-ir neurons in the CA1, CA3 and DG in P360 rats was observed. Chronic FS had no significant influence on IL-1beta expression in the hippocampus or on the percentage of IL-1beta-ir neurons in CA1, CA3 and DG hippocampal subfields in either age group. During HL-OF, the IL-1beta level was significantly increased in the hippocampus of P28 and P360 rats, whereas a marked increase in the percentage of IL-1beta-ir neurons in the CA1, CA3 and DG hippocampal areas occurred only in P360 animals. These results indicate that chronic HL-OF stimulation was the factor inducing changes in the IL-1beta protein levels in P28 and P360 rats and in the percentage of IL-1beta/NeuN-ir cells in the hippocampus of P360 animals.",

Laser-microdissected A2 cells from estradiolor oil-implanted ovariectomized female rats were analyzed by Western blot to assess effects of three prior daily insulin injections on basal and hypoglycemic patterns of catecholamine biosynthetic enzyme dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DβH) and rate-limiting energy pathway enzyme protein expression. Precedent hypoglycemia respectively decreased or increased baseline DβH expression in estradiol- (E) vs. oil (O)-treated rats; this protein profile was further suppressed or augmented in those animals at 2 hr after re-induction of hypoglycemia. These data suggest that estradiol may curtail A2 noradrenergic‑controlled functions both in the midst of and between hypoglycemic bouts. Results also show that prior hypoglycemia exposure upregulated A2 neuron glycolytic enzyme protein levels when E was present, and exerted differential effects on basal and hypoglycemia-associated respiratory chain and fatty acid synthetic pathway enzyme expression. E may thus accordingly amplify glycolysis-derived metabolites/energy, coupled with reduced reliance on oxidative phosphorylation, and activate the fatty acid synthetic pathway during RIIH. E may also be of benefit by preventing maladaptive reductions in A2 neuron Krebs cycle/electron transport enzyme expression during re-exposure to hypoglycemia. Augmentation of negative energy balance during this recurring metabolic stress in the absence of E is a likely impetus for augmented vs. decreased A2 signaling of energy imbalance by DβH in O vs. E rats during RIIH.",

Transient receptor potential vanilloid sub‑type 1 (TRPV1) play an important role in the development of allodynia and hyperalgesia following injury and the ensuing inflammatory conditions. Resiniferatoxin (RTX) is an ultrapotent synthetic TRPV1 agonist and many different administration routes are available for different mechanisms and different effects. RTX is used intraperitonially as a model of neuropathic pain or epidurally and topically to produce prolonged analgesic effects. However, the use of RTX is controversial because its neurotoxicity and margin of safety have not been addressed adequately. The present study evaluates the effect of intrathecal RTX on the induction and allodynia behavior of animals submitted to neuropathic pain by chronic constriction injury (CCI).160 Swiss mice were randomly distributed into two groups: intrathecal pre‑treatment group (PRE) aiming the effect in induction of allodynia and late intrathecal treatment group (POST) to evaluate the antiallodynic effect of the RTX on mechanical nociceptive threshold evaluated by the Von Frey hair filaments. Additionally, we evaluated the expression of TRPV1 in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) by western blotting after PRE‑ and POST‑treatment with RTX.Our results showed that the CCI mice developed prolonged mechanical allodynia‑like behavior in ipsilateral paw after surgery up to 24 hours. The PRE‑ and POST‑treatment groups presented significant antiallodynic effects in ipsilateral paw for 24 hours. Only the POST‑treatment group showed a significant reduction of expression of the TRPV1 receptor after CCI.The presented data demonstrated that both PRE‑ and POST‑treatment with RTX given intrathecally produced potent antiallodynic activities in CCI mice and that POST‑treatment can reduce TRPV1 expression in DRG, suggesting that POST‑treatment RTX can revert central sensitization and its associated allodynia.",

Rats were habituated for three days to a self-exposure cage with two nose-poke holes.

The experimental rats performed more nose-pokes during self-exposure session than animals from the control group. This effect was accompanied by a higher density of c-Fos-positive nuclei in the hippocampal CA1. There were no significant group differences in c-Fos expression in other brain regions analysed. However, possible involvement of several other structures in self-exposure (i.e., CA3, the dentate gyrus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and nucleus accumbens) is also discussed, as their correlational activity, reflected by c-Fos immunoactivity, was observed in the experimental rats. During test sessions, there were more nose-pokes accompanied by short 22 kHz calls and 50 kHz calls performed by the rats of the experimental group than of the control group. The CA1 region has previously been associated with novelty; short 22 kHz USV and flat 50 kHz USV could be associated with self-exposure, also they appear to be emitted correlatively.",

    "abstract": "The brain endocannabinoid system has been shown to play a role in many physiological processes, including mood, learning and memory. It is also involved in the pathogenesis of anxiety, depression, mood disorders, as well as neurodegenerative disorders, although the exact mechanisms by which cannabinoid receptors interfere in these disorders are not well established. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of cannabinoid ligands HU-210 (CB1 receptor agonist) and SR 141716A (CB1 receptor antagonist) on learning and memory processes of rats with depressive – like state, induced by bilateral olfactory bulbectomy. The bilateral olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) is a validated model of depression, which can be used also as an animal model of Alzheimer's disease. We found that the subchronic treatment of OBX rats with HU 210 and SR 141716A exerted modulatory effect on rat's performance in both active avoidance (shuttle box) and passive avoidance (step through) tests. HU 210 ameliorated the memory deficits of OBX rats; however, the scores of the sham-operated controls had not been reached. SR 141716A modified the avoidance performance in OBX rats and showed a memory enhancing effect in the sham-operated rats. Our findings suggest that CB1 receptors might be involved in avoidance learning and memory acquisition in OBX rats.",

    "abstract": "Memory impairment is a feature of several diseases and detrimental as aging population have increased worldwide. Sustained advanced glycation end products (AGEs) receptor (RAGE) activation triggers the production of reactive oxygen species and inflammatory response, leading to neuronal dysfunction and neurodegenerative disorders. Methylglyoxal (MGO) is the most relevant and reactive glycating agent in vivo, leading to the formation of AGEs. Here, we investigated the role of RAGE on the memory impairment induced by MGO. Swiss female mice were treated for 11 days with MGO, FPS‑ZM1 (a high‑affinity RAGE antagonist), or the combination of both. Locomotor activity was not impaired by the treatments, as evaluated by the open field and spontaneous alternation test. MGO treatment impaired short‑ and long‑term spatial memory in the object location task, caused deficits on the short‑term aversive memory in the step‑down inhibitory avoidance task, and decreased working memory performance as evaluated by the Y‑maze spontaneous alternation test. FPS‑ZM1 treatment abolished deficits on the short‑term aversive memory and working memory, but was unable to prevent the impairment in short‑term or long‑term spatial memory. Since the addition of RAGE antagonist in co‑treatment with MGO protected mice from the aversive and working memory deficits, AGEs generated by the MGO treatment would be involved in the memory impairment due to RAGE activation. Therefore, further studies are required to establish the involvement of RAGE in the MGO‑induced memory impairment. Nevertheless, our results suggested FPS‑ZM1 treatment as a promising new therapeutic strategy to prevent cognitive dysfunction caused by dicarbonyl stress, further investigation is required to confirm our findings.",

The passive avoidance and Morris water maze (MWM) tests were used to evaluate learning and memory performance. Behavioral tests were carried out between 21 and 30 days after the initial Ang IV injection. Hippocampi were dissected and retained for biochemical and Western blot analysis. The Dia group exhibited the poorest behavioral results, while the Dia+Ang IV group performed highest on the MWM task. Superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and malondialdehyde levels increased significantly in the Dia group compared to Dia+Ang IV. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and N-methyl-D-aspartate levels were significantly elevated, while levels of GABAAsignificantly decreased, in the Dia+Ang IV group compared to the Dia group. These findings suggest that peripheral administration of Ang IV ameliorated spatial memory in diabetic rats by decreasing hippocampal oxidative stress and BDNF levels.",

It appears that IGL integrates photic cues from retina with non-photic information originating from different nonspecific brain systems. Subsequently, this integrated signal is passed to the master biological clock – the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). The common neurotransmitter of biological clock neural structures, the gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) is expressed in many, if not all, IGL and SCN neurons. Whole-cell patch clamp in vitro electrophysiological experiments were performed in order to evaluate GABA’s influence on single IGL neurons in rat. Most neurons were hyperpolarized by GABA application and this effect was caused by activation of GABAA as well as GABAB receptors. The presence of GABAB receptors in rat’s IGL has been suggested for the first time.",

    "abstract": "It is well-known that the cholinergic system and the muscarinic cholinergic receptors are associated with cognitive functions. Here we examined whether a non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine affects learning performance and/or synaptic plasticity during the memory consolidation period. Adult male Wistar rats (250–300 g) were injected with scopolamine (2 mg/kg) or saline immediately after training in a “passive avoidance” task. Memory retention test was conducted 24 h after training. The changes in the latency of the first entry into a dark compartment of a test chamber was chosen as a criterion of learning. The efficacy of synaptic transmission was estimated by the changes in the basal level of focal potentials (fEPSP amplitude and slope ratio) before training (baseline), 90 min after the training (consolidation period), and 24 hour after the training (retention period). We found that foot-shock presentation by itself had no effect on fEPSP within the first 90 min after training, but in 24 hour fEPSPs were decreased. In untrained rats administration of scopolamine had no effect on the fEPSP amplitude within the first 90 min after the injection, but in 24 h we observed an increase in the fEPSP amplitude. In trained animals, scopolamine decreased the fEPSP amplitude in the hippocampal CA1 area during first 1.5 h after the injection. However, the drug had no effect on the memory retention in the passive avoidance task. Taken together our data suggest that scopolamine modifies the synaptic placticity of the hippocampal network but does not induce significant changes in the retention of the passive avoidance skill.",

However, a link between behaviors and learning process in the brain of animal model of autism remained largely unexplored. Particularly, spontaneous neural signaling in learning-related brain areas has not been studied. This study investigated local field potential (LFP) of the hippocampus (HP), the olfactory bulb (OB) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in mice prenatally exposed to valproic acid (VPA) on gestational day 13. Adult male Swiss albino mouse offspring implanted with intracranial electrodes were used. VPA-exposed mice exhibited ASD-associated behaviors. Hippocampal LFP analysis revealed that VPA group significantly increased low gamma activity (25–45 Hz) during awake immobility. Regression analyses confirmed positive correlations between locomotor speed and hippocampal theta oscillations in control but not VPA group. VPA group exhibited increases in delta (1–4 Hz) and beta (25–35 Hz) activities in OB during awake immobility and active exploring, respectively. Moreover, significantly increased and decreased coherences between HP and OB of VPA animals were seen within gamma (active exploration) and theta (awake immobility) ranges, respectively. In addition, significant increase in coherence between HP and mPFC was seen within delta range during active exploration. In addition to three ASD symptoms, VPA animals also exhibited differential patterns of olfacto-hippocampal LFP, altered locomotor speed-related hippocampal theta activities and distinct interplays between HP and learning-related brain areas. The altered olfacto-hippocampal and medial prefrontal cortex-hippocampal networks may underlie impairments in autism mouse model.",

Given the similarity between changes produced by social stress in animals and symptoms of certain human psychopathologies such as depression and anxiety, the effects of the antidepressant clomipramine on IA impairment produced by CSDS were evaluated in the present study. Male CD1 mice were randomly assigned to the groups: non-stressed+saline, non-stressed+clomipramine, stressed+saline and stressed+clomipramine. Stressed animals were subjected to daily agonistic encounters (10 min) in the home cage of the aggressor over a 20-day period. Just before each encounter, non-stressed and stressed mice were injected i.p. with saline or clomipramine (10 mg/kg) according to their experimental condition. 24 hours after the last CSDS session, all the mice were tested in a step-through IA task. In the IA training phase, animals were punished by a shock to the paw when they entered the dark compartment of the apparatus. In the IA test phase (one week later) the same procedure took place, but without shock. Complementary measures were obtained by evaluating all the animals in an elevated plus maze (locomotor activity and emotionality) and on a hot plate (analgesia). IA learning was confirmed in all groups except the stressed+saline group, which was the only one that exhibited higher anxiety levels. No variations were observed in either locomotor activity or analgesia. In conclusion, CSDS induces anxiety and impairs emotional memory in mice; the negative effects of CSDS on memory appear to be attenuated by clomipramine, and these detrimental effects do not seem to be secondary to the effects of CSDS on locomotor activity, emotionality or pain sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Hypothyroidism affects neuron population dynamics in the hippocampus of the adult rat, with neuronal damage as the main feature of its effect. This effect is prevented by the blockade of NMDA receptors, which suggests that glutamatergic activity mediates cell death in this condition. Glutamate can also stimulate cell proliferation and survival of newborn neurons, indicating that it can affect different stages of the cell cycle. In this work we measured the expression of specific proteins that control cell proliferation (cycline-D1), cell arrest (p21), damage (p53) or apoptosis (Bax and Bcl2) in the hippocampus of hypothyroid rats treated with the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) blocker MK-801 during the induction of hypothyroidism. The results show that hypothyroidism increases the expression of markers of DNA damage, cell arrest, and apoptosis, but does not affect the marker of cell proliferation. NMDAR blockade prevents the increase on markers of DNA damage and apoptosis, but does not influence cell arrest or cell proliferation. This suggests that hypothyroidism promotes cell death mainly by an excitotoxic effect of glutamate.",

Phosphodiesterase‑1 (PDE1) inhibitors are known to provide benefits in various brain conditions. We investigated the role of a selective PDE1 inhibitor, vinpocetine on ASD‑related behavioral phenotypes (social behavioral deficits, repetitive behavior, anxiety, and hyperlocomotion) in a developmental hyperserotonemia (DHS) rat model. Also, effects on biochemical markers related with neuronal function brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein (pCREB), inflammation interleukins (IL‑6 and IL‑10) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF‑α), and oxidative stress (TBARS and GSH) were studied in important brain areas (frontal cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, and striatum). Administration of 5‑methoxytryptamine (5‑MT) to rats prenatally (gestational day 12) and in early developmental stages postnatal day (PND 0 - PND 20), resulted in impaired behavior and brain biochemistry. Administration of vinpocetine daily (10 and 20 mg/kg) to 5‑MT rats from PND 21 to PND 48 resulted in an improvement of behavioral deficits. Also, vinpocetine administration significantly increased the levels of BDNF, ratio of pCREB/ CREB, IL‑10, and GSH, and significantly decreased TNF‑α, IL‑6, and TBARS levels in different brain areas. Finally, our correlation analysis indicated that behavioral outcomes were significantly associated with the biochemical outcome. Vinpocetine, a selective PDE1 inhibitor, rectified important behavioral phenotypes related with ASD, possibly by improving markers of neuronal function, brain inflammation, and brain oxidative stress. Thus, PDE1 could be a potential target for pharmacological interventions and furthering our understanding of ASD pathogenesis.",

GnRH neurons respond to long-term stress in diminishing of neuropeptide release from the nerve terminals due to the depression of its axonal transport. Chronic restriction of dietary proteins in lambs reduces the plasma LH concentrations but does not impair the development of GnRH neurons nor the synthesis and processing of GnRH. It is suggested that malnutrition delays the first ovulation probably due to the neural mechanism responsible for the preovulatory GnRH/LH output. Stress has rather unclear effect on growth hormone (GH) secretion in the sheep. Prolonged, but not short stressful stimulation provokes the rapid release of somatostatin, which is sustained during long-term stimulation. These results suggest that effect of stress on somatotrophic axis depends on the period of stressful stimulation. Chronic malnutrition enhances secretion of GH by an increase in amplitude of GH pulses and reduces the secretory activity of somatostatin neurons. It is postulated that nutrients can influence GH secretion in the sheep by mechanism dependent on the hypothalamic somatostatin.",

CVP was administered in a single i.p. dose of 1.0 mg/kg (1/10 of the LD50). All animals were challenged with 1.0 mg/kg amphetamine (AMPH) three weeks after the CVP exposure, i.e. after a time sufficient for acetylcholinesterase recovery. Some rats were also given AMPH three weeks before the CVP exposure. In rats challenged with AMPH only once after the CVP exposure, AMPH- induced open-field locomotion was significantly reduced. Such an effect was not observed in rats given AMPH three weeks before the CVP exposure. The results suggest that a single CVP exposure may result in persistent dopaminergic hyposensitivity, and that an amphetamine pretreatment may protect the rat against this effect.",

PI, involved in the phototransduction cascade, never reached greater concentrations than 7% of the total. High concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as 20:4n-6, 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 (DHA, docosahexaenoic acid) were present in PC, PE and PS, but scarce in SM and PI. In retinae of crayfish kept at 4 degrees C in darkness for 3 weeks and then exposed to white light (6 h; ca. 4,500 lx), SM and PS remained seemingly unaffected. PC, however, significantly decreased within 10 min to 65% of the initial value and 50% at 180 min. To study the reduction of PC, lipids of retinae suspended in physiological solution with/without phospholipase C (PLC) and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) inhibitors such as DMDA (= DEDA), manoalide, ET-18-OCH3, and U-73122 were measured. Only free fatty acids (FFA) of retinae with inhibitors of PLA2 like DMDA and manoalide decreased. Retinae irradiated by white light for 3 h displayed a significant reduction of PC, compared with those that had remained in continuous darkness. However, the PC of retinae with PLA2-inhibitors was not decreased by light. Our results provide evidence that not only photoreceptor cell PLC, but also PLA2 is activated by light.",

During the first exposure to the maze both species spent most of the time in the enclosed arms but opossums showed much higher frequency of entries into the open arms and stayed there longer. On the third and subsequent days opossums reduced their entries into the open arms and spent more time on the central square, where unlike rats they frequently groomed their lower belly and hind legs. During the last sessions they started spending more time in the enclosed arms. It is concluded that probably opossums, like rats show a stable anxiety evoked by open space. However, in the rat anxiety prevails over motivation to explore a new environment, while in the opossum it is initially at equilibrium with curiosity which habituates slower than in the rat. Results are discussed in the context of different ecology of the gray opossum that actively searches and hunts quickly moving insects. Thigmotaxic behavior, while strong in both species, dominates spontaneous behavior of the rat, but not opossum.",

Three experiments were conducted. In the first, five groups of rats were acutely treated with different doses of Triazolam (0.25 mg/kg-4.0 mg/kg). In the second experiment, rats were treated chronically with a single daily dose of Triazolam (started with 0.25 mg/kg and increased by time to 1.0 mg/kg) for 5 weeks, simulating clinical use. In the third, rats were treated chronically with three daily doses of Triazolam (started with 0.25 mg/kg and increased by time to 0.5 mg/kg) for 20 days, representing a form of drug abuse. Brain levels of GABA and plasma levels of Triazolam were measured using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The acute Triazolam administration produced an increase in GABA levels in all brain areas studied. The chronic administration of single daily dose of Triazolam produced normal GABA levels in all brain areas except brain stem where the levels were significantly decreased; this indicates the development of tolerance to Triazolam action on increasing GABA content. The chronic administration of three daily doses of Triazolam produced a decrease in GABA levels in all brain regions studied. In conclusion, chronic single daily dose treatment (representing normal use) produces tolerance to Triazolam effects on brain GABA levels, while chronic three daily doses administration (akin to drug abuse) causes a fall in GABA levels.",

A pair of experiments was conducted to examine drug-induced modification of the cholinergic nicotinic receptor subtype on rates of learning by young and aged rats. In experiment I males (4-7 months or 20-25 months old) were administered nicotine (0.0, 0.3 or 0.7 mg/kg injected s.c. daily) and tested in both a T-maze non-spatial discrimination paradigm and a hole board spatial task. Nicotine failed to improve acquisition by young animals on either task. Nicotine also failed to improve non-spatial learning by old animals. However, both dosages of nicotine improved performance by the old males in the spatial paradigm. In experiment II, a 5-choice serial discrimination paradigm designed to better evaluate visual attention and spatial working memory in aging was used. Groups of old male rats were administered nicotine or mecamylamine (2 or 8 mg/kg), an antagonist of the nicotinic cholinergic receptor. Results were that the 0.3 mg nicotine group learned the task fastest and achieved the highest learning asymptote. Both learning rates and final levels of performance were worst in the 8 mg mecamylamine group. However, the 2 mg mecamylamine rats were the equals of the control group and both reached a higher asymptote than the 0.7 mg nicotine group. These data suggest that healthy old animals can accrue benefits from nicotinic activation but that the benefits are complex, being limited to certain dosages and to specific cognitive skills.",

The intracerebroventricular infusions of vehicle (control), melatonin, naloxone and melatonin in combination with naloxone were made in ewes in the luteal phase of the estrous cycle, from 2:00 P.M. to 5:00 P.M. Blood samples were collected from 11:00 A.M. to 8:00 P.M. at 10-min intervals. The mean plasma LH concentrations were measured before, during and after the infusions. The frequency and amplitude of LH pulses were determined during the whole experimental period. The LH concentrations recorded during melatonin or naloxone infusions were significantly higher than the concomitant concentration in vehicle-infused animals. The mean LH pulse amplitude in melatonin- and naloxone-treated ewes was also significantly higher than in controls. The LH concentration measured during the combined infusion of melatonin and naloxone was significantly higher than that during vehicle infusion. The LH concentration recorded in turn after the treatment was significantly higher than the concomitant concentrations in vehicle-, melatonin- and naloxone-infused animals. The mean LH pulse amplitude in this group was significantly higher than in the vehicle-infused group. These results indicate that blockade of the opiate receptors within the CNS facilitated effective stimulation of daily LH secretion by exogenous melatonin. In conclusion, a relationship between melatonin and endogenous opioid peptides may be crucial in enabling melatonin to exhibit stimulatory action on LH secretion during the luteal phase of the estrous cycle in ewes.",

Initial observations showing that sensory stimuli can trigger evoked, or induced, oscillations has generated a large number of studies where, explicitly or implicitly, the large-scale rhythmic activity of thalamo-cortical neurons was viewed as a key factor to synchronize neurons responding to different dimensions of a given stimulus, and therefore to solve the so-called \"binding problem\" (for reviews see Eckhorn 2000, Singer 1990, 1999). This line of research contrasts with the rate coding concept which has been used over the last 40 years to describe the functional properties of neurons in sensory systems and the plasticity of sensory systems both during development and in adulthood. We review here results obtained in the thalamo-cortical auditory system. After a characterization of the oscillatory events, we determined their origins by inactivating each component of the thalamo-cortical loop. Then we compared, within the same animals, the oscillations obtained in anesthetized and unanesthetized conditions. Our data strongly suggest that to clarify the functional roles of evoked oscillations, and more generally of any aspects of temporal coding, we need to study them on awake animals.",

We examined how preconditioning with 2-min ischemia affects disturbances in the nest building behavior and locomotor activity induced by the injurious 3-min ischemia. Morphological examination confirmed that preconditioning significantly reduced neuronal damage in CA1 evoked by injurious ischemia. Behavioral studies demonstrated that preconditioning reduced the locomotor hyperactivity and latency in nest building after test ischemia, in comparison to sham or naive animals.

To investigate this in an in vitro model, the acute effects of nicotine on the firing of SNc and VTA neurons were compared in transverse juvenile rat midbrain sections (300-350 µm) using extracellular recording. Levels of nicotine comparable with those encountered in smokers (0.2-1.0 µM, 3 min) not only increased firing rate, but also evoked prolonged irregular firing, as indicated by the increase in the coefficient of variation of discharge frequencies. Pre- and postsynaptic nicotinic cholinergic receptors (nAChRs) were involved, as both effects persisted, although at an attenuated level, in low Ca2+/high Mg2+. Only the nicotine-induced elevation of firing rate was sensitive to the glutamate receptor antagonists APV and CNQX, implying that enhanced glutamate release and glutamate receptor activation are involved in the effects of nicotine on discharge frequency but not pattern. Furthermore, nicotine (1.0 µM) exerted a greater increase in the firing frequency of VTA neurons relative to SNc neurons, suggesting that the differential effects on the two populations previously reported in vivo were due to a difference in the postsynaptic nAChR response and/or local synaptic circuits. Low concentrations of nicotine can thus profoundly modulate the activity of dopaminergic mesencephalic neurons through a local action within the ventral midbrain in vitro, and, similarly to in vivo conditions, evoke stronger effects in the VTA.",

Injections of Fast Blue (FB) into PML and Diamidino Yellow (DY) into the uvula, resulted in prominent labeling neurons with FB bilaterally and with DY ipsilaterally, in the principal trigeminal nucleus, subnucleus oralis, and rostral and caudal subnucleus interpolaris. We observed topographical arrangement of neurons in such a fashion that FB labeled cells were localized in the medial and DY labeled cells in the lateral regions of TSN. Apart from this small number of double FB+DY labeled neurons (n = 138) were found in the narrow common region of single labeling. This implies that PML and the uvula receive independent trigeminal sensory information from neurons in separate regions of TSN. However, some trigeminal neurons may also exert simultaneous influences upon these hemispheral and vermal components by way of axonal branchings.",

In this study we investigated the role of all four ICER isoforms in cortical neuronal culture, comparing their expression level in serum-deprived/MK-801-treated neurons and their pro-apoptotic properties towards transfected cortical neurons. We have found that all four isoforms are induced upon pro-apoptotic treatment, and also that each of them separately evokes neuronal cell death following cortical culture transfection with the genes.

Chronic administration of the \"equivalent\" to the stress dose of exogenous corticosterone (5 mg kg-1 daily for 21 days) also impaired recall of PAB, and this effect was also reversed by Hypericum perforatum.

    "abstract": "Iron plays an important role in maintaining normal brain function. However, in many neurodegenerative diseases abnormal iron accumulation in specific brain regions has been consistently reported. In this study, we investigated the neurotoxic effect of the intracerebroventricularly injected iron on the cerebellar Purkinje cells in the rat and the role of nitric oxide (NO) in this process. The role of NO in rats administered iron (FeCl36H2O) was examined with the use of a donor of NO, L-arginine (L-Arg) and a central selective inhibitor of NO synthase, 7-nitroindazole (7-NI). For this reason, rats were divided into 5 groups: control, iron-injected, iron plus L-Arg, iron plus 7-NI, and iron plus L-Arg plus 7-NI. Means (value +/- standard deviation) of the total numbers of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum were estimated as 337 +/- 23, 209 +/- 16, 167 +/- 19, 305 +/- 26, and 265 +/- 14 thousands in the control, iron, iron plus L-Arg, iron plus 7-NI, and iron plus L-Arg plus 7-NI groups, respectively. Iron treatment alone and the combination of iron and L-Arg caused a significant reduction in the total number of cerebellar Purkinje cells. Therefore, L-Arg increased the Purkinje cell loss induced by treatment with iron. These data show that inhibition of the neuronal NOS by 7-NI can prevent some of the deleterious effects of iron on cerebellar Purkinje cells. Presence of L-arginine decreased the neuroprotective effect of 7-NI.",

Thirty minutes after penicillin injection (500 units, i.c.), the most effective dose of alpha-tocopherol (500 mg/kg) was administered intramuscularly (i.m.). Acute administration of ethanol, in a dose of 3 g/kg, did not change either frequency or amplitude of penicillin-induced epileptiform activity, while dose of 9 g/kg ethanol significantly decreased the mean frequency of penicillin-induced epileptiform ECoG activity in the ethanol-treated group. Ethanol (9 g/kg) withdrawal also caused an increase in the amplitude of epileptiform ECoG activity in the withdrawal group. The results suggest that acute administration of high dose ethanol (9 g/kg) and alpha-tocopherol have some limited anticonvulsive effects in penicillin-induced epileptiform activity in rats.",

In this in vitro study, we investigated the efficacy of xenon dissolved in various lipid emulsions (Intralipid(R), Lipofundin(R), ClinOleic(R) and Abbolipid(R)) on NMDA-evoked currents in cultured cortical neurons. The NMDA receptor blocking property at a clinically relevant concentration seen in the lipid emulsions tested may contribute to the anesthetic, analgetic and neuroprotective effects of xenon administered by way of these lipid carriers.

    "abstract": "Our previous study demonstrated that preconditioning by 3-times repetitive mild hypoxia significantly augmented expression of mitochondrial thioredoxin-2 (Trx-2) at 3 h after subsequent acute severe hypoxia in rat hippocampus. However, it was unclear whether this augmentation was due to build up of Trx-2 by mild hypoxia before severe hypoxia or by modification of reaction to severe hypoxia itself. To answer on this question we study the expression level during and after preconditioning without subsequent severe hypoxia. Trx-2 expression was studied by immunocytochemistry 3 h and 24 h after first session and 3 h and 24 h after last session of 3-times (spaced at 24 h) mild hypobaric hypoxia (360 Torr, 2h). At 3 h after 1-time hypoxia (first session of 3-time hypoxia) the total number of Trx-2-immunoreactive cells (Nt) was significantly decreased in contrast with control in CA2, CA3 and DG. The number of cells with intensive expression of Trx-2 (Ni) was reduced in CA1 and CA3. At 24 h after the same 1-time hypoxia Nt was lower than in control and at 3 h time-point in all hippocampal areas studied (CA1, CA2, CA3 and DG); Ni was decreased only compared to control in CA1 and CA3. At 3 h after last session of 3-times hypoxia Nt and Ni were significantly down regulated in comparison with control only in CA1. At 24 h after it Nt was significantly decreased compared to control in CA1, CA2 and CA3 (in DG the decrease was not statistically significant) but in all areas was higher than at 24 h after 1-time hypoxia. Dynamics of Nt changes from 3-hours after single to 24-hours after triple moderate hypoxia had the wave phase character. These findings indicate that Trx-2 expression in most areas of hippocampus was decreased to 24 h after 3-time mild hypoxia. Thus the augmentation of Trx-2 expression in hippocampal neurons of preconditioned animals in response to subsequent severe hypoxia is caused obviously not by Trx-2 accumulation during preconditioning sessions but by modification of reaction to severe impact.",

There was no significant increase in freezing time from post-test 1 to post-test 2 and there were no differences between the three shocked groups, implying that the different numbers of shocks did not affect the degree of contextual freezing, probably because the ceiling freezing value had already been reached.

A first experiment was designed to examine the effect of salt consumption (standard 0.25 percent Na+ vs. low-salt 0.04 percent Na+ diet) on the fluid-electrolytic balance (plasma sodium, urinary sodium excretion, urine osmolality) and water intake of ME polydipsic animals. In the first 6 h post-surgery, the natriuretic response was higher in ME-lesioned animals than in control groups. At 24 h post-surgery, however, less sodium was excreted by ME rats fed with a standard salt diet (ME/SS), despite showing no decrease in salt intake, and they evidenced an increase in plasma sodium concentration and water intake. Urine osmolality was significantly higher in control animals than in either ME-lesioned group. In experiment 2, hypertonic NaCl administration (2 ml/2M) increased the polydipsic behavior of ME-lesioned but not control rats (day 2). Animals deprived of food/salt showed a significant reduction (on day 2) in the initial (day 1) polydipsia, which increased on day 3 when the animals had access to a standard-salt diet. These results suggest that the reduced natriuretic response and the consequent sodium retention observed in ME animals may exacerbate the hydromineral imbalance of this polydipsic syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral flexibility is subserved by the prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia. Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and dorsomedial striatum (DMS) form a functional frontocorticostriatal circuit crucial for the mediation of flexibility during reversal learning via dopamine (DA) neurotransmission. The regulatory control in maintaining DA homeostasis and function is provided by the dopamine transporter (DAT), which therefore likely plays a significant role in controlling the influence of DA on cognitive processes. Here we used a gene knockout mouse model to investigate the role of DAT in the performance on the Attentional Set-Shifting Task (ASST) stages dependent upon the OFC and the DMS. Additionally, behavior of mice after repeated administration of selective DAT inhibitor, GBR 12909, was examined. The animals were treated with the inhibitor to elicit a compensatory DAT up-regulation following withdrawal. Learning was slower and the number of errors during reversal learning and intra-dimensional shift stages was higher in DAT+/- mutant mice than in WT mice. GBR 12909-treated mice had deficits in reversal stages of the ASST. Neuronal activation in the OFC and DMS during the ASST was examined with early growth response proteins 1 and 2 (egr-1, egr-2) immunohistochemistry. Density of egr-2 labeled cells in the OFC was lower in mutant mice than in wild-types during reversal learning and the expression of the egr-1 was lower in mutant mice in the OFC and DMS during reversal and intra-dimensional shift stages. Mice with decreased DAT levels displayed behavioral difficulties that were accompanied by a lower task-induced activation of neurons in brain regions involved in the reversal learning. Altogether, these data indicate the role of the DAT in the behavioral flexibility.",

Since no data have shown an interaction between urethane and cannabinoid signaling in epilepsy, we examined the suitability of urethane with regard to testing the effects of a cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist and an antagonist on penicillin-induced epileptiform activity in rats. Permanent screw electrodes for electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings, and a permanent cannula for administration of the substances to the brain ventricles, were placed into the cranium of rats. Epileptiform activity was induced by injection of penicillin through the cannula in conscious animal. The CB1 receptor agonist arachidonyl-2-chloroethylamide (ACEA; 7.5 μg) and the CB1 receptor antagonist [N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3 carboxamide] (AM-251; 0.25 μg) were administered intracerebroventricularly 30 minutes after the penicillin application in urethane-anesthetized and conscious animals. Urethane completely eliminated spontaneous ictal events in ECoG recordings and reduced the frequency and total amount of epileptiform activity. It did not alter either the proconvulsant effects of AM-251 or the anticonvulsant effects of ACEA on penicillin-induced epileptiform activity. The electrophysiological evidence suggests that there is no possible interaction between urethane and cannabinoid CB1 receptors in this experimental model of epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Acetylcholine is a fast-acting neurotransmitter in synapses and neuromuscular junctions that is decreased in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by hyper-activation of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which leads to progressive loss of memory and neurobehavioral abnormalities.Therefore, AChE inhibitors have therapeutic potential in AD that could include natural compounds such as bile acids.Bile acids, as potent molecules, could improve some types of neurodegenerative diseases via antioxidant effects and other unknown mechanisms.The aim of this study was to investigate beneficial effects of bile acids on AChE catalytic and non-catalytic functions, amyloid plaque deposit and memory in a rat model of AD.The effects of sodium deoxycholate and cholic acid on AChE activity were assessed by in vitro assay.Then, the bile acids' potential therapeutic effects were investigated on nucleus basalis of Meynert lesioned rats using behavioral evaluation, biochemical tests and histological methods.Molecular docking simulation was also implemented to investigate the possible interaction between bile acids and AChE.According to the in vitro and in vivo results, sodium deoxycholate could efficiently inhibit the catalytic function of the enzyme by interacting with the catalytic site, while cholic acid interacted with the peripheral anionic site and inhibited chaperone activity of the enzyme that led to the reduced amyloid plaque deposition.The co-administration of cholic acid and sodium deoxycholate showed these compounds are able to simultaneously inhibit the catalytic and non-catalytic functions of the enzyme.This study clarifies the roles of natural bile acids in the nervous system and in AChE function through multiple experimental and simulation methods.",

Our aim was to test whether the loss of MCs and MF sprouting are coupled processes in PILO-treated rodents. Animals which exhibited intense PILO-induced convulsions for at least 30 min were used in this study. After a 2-month survival period, the incidence of epileptic seizures was checked individually by neuropeptide-Y (NPY) immunohistochemistry, and the numbers of MCs were counted by means of immunohistochemistry, for calretinin (CR) in mice and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in rats. MF sprouting was checked by using Timm’s silver-sulphide method for zinc. In our comparative studies, NPY immunohistochemistry resulted in more positive animals than on zinc staining. The CR immunoreactivity remained unchanged even in those mice that displayed MF sprouting and greatly increased NPY immunoreactivity. CR immunoreactivity was also verified after transection of the fornix to exclude the extrahippocampal source of this peptide. However, the CGRP immunoreactivity was severely reduced in those rats that exhibited simultaneous increases in zinc content and NPY immunoreactivity in the supragranular layer and stratum lucidum. Our findings suggest that the MCs survive PILO treatment in mice, but not in rats. There is direct evidence of a close relationship between the loss of MCs and MF sprouting in rats, but not in mice. Thus, similar PILO seizures may result from different changes in the neuronal circuits of rodents.",

One of the possible etiological factors of intellectual giftedness is testosterone which is believed to affect the brain organization and function. The aim of our study was to analyze associations between 2D:4D digit ratio (a proxy of prenatal testosterone) and/or salivary testosterone levels with non-verbal IQ in intellectually gifted girls. Fifty-one girls with an age range of 10 to18 years and IQ scores higher than 130 were tested. Saliva samples were collected to obtain levels of salivary testosterone. 2D:4D digit ratio was measured on both hands as an indicator of prenatal testosterone. IQ parameters were assessed employing standardized set of tests. The CAG repeat polymorphism in exon 1 of the androgen receptor gene was analyzed to assess the sensitivity of androgen receptor. Testing of between-subjects effects proved significant interactions between right and left 2D:4D ratio, genetic variability in androgen receptor, and also salivary testosterone level with non-verbal IQ in gifted girls. Our results point out that the variability in parameters of androgenicity contributes to the variability of nonverbal IQ in gifted girls. However, the exact molecular mechanism of how testosterone acts on the brain and affects this cognitive domain remains still unclear.",

In Golgi-Cox stained tissue the basilar dendritic arbor of pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex of early underfed adult lactating dams was evaluated. The anterior cingulate of the rat plays a major role in the execution of sexual, maternal and visual attentional control and other cognitive responses. The effects of neonatal undernutrition on the basilar dendritic tree and perikaryon measurements in layer II/III pyramidal neurons of the anterior cingulate were examined in lactating dams at postpartum days 8 and 12. In the underfed dams the distal portions of the basilar dendrites had fewer branches and a lower dendritic density of dendrites, and neurons had perikarya with reduced perimeter and cross-sectional area. Thus, the neuronal alterations may interfere the plastic synaptic activity and with maternal cognitive performance of rats subjected to early underfeeding. These anatomical alterations of the anterior cingulate may help to understand the disruption of long-term cognitive processes associated with perinatal food restriction.",

The 8-micrometer-thick sections were stained either with cresyl violet, Weil method or with immunocytochemical methods for amyloid (4G8) and neurofibrillary tangles (Tau-1). Cell bodies, senile plaques and tangles were counted in all brains. In brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease a significant neuronal loss (about 56 %) was observed in the second layer of the entorhinal cortex. The tangles/neurones ratio was very high (62.79.1%) in this layer. A great number of senile plaques were present in the whole hippocampal formation, especially in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (22.91.5 plaques/mm2) which is the termination zone of the perforant path. It seems therefore, that pathological alterations in Alzheimer's disease disrupt the main input to the hippocampal formation. In \"physiological\" ageing we did not observe changes in the density of neurones, although single tangles and plaques were found in all hippocampal areas. In elderly individuals 3.81.3% of neurones of the second layer revealed neurofibrillary pathology; a few plaques were found in various areas of the hippocampal formation. These observations may suggest only a slight decrease in number of neurones in the hippocampal formation. However, these changes cause a slight impairment of memory and learning often found in elderly individuals without dementia.",

In vivo treatment of rats with lead acetate results in a decrease in the K(+)-depolarization-dependent release of GABA and dopamine and histidine. Lead given in vitro itself (independently of depolarizing condition) stimulated the release of previously accumulated neurotransmitters in synaptosomes (GABA and dopamine). This effect depends on lead acetate concentration. On the other hand lead, in different concentrations, did not cause changes in the histidine release. The results show that lead can attack the synaptic neurotransmission in two ways: by depressing the Ca-KCl-evoked release of GABA, dopamine and histidine and by a selective stimulation of a spontaneous release (independent of depolarization conditions) of GABA and dopamine but not histidine.",

To identify the possible involvement of functional alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary system in producing these deficits, we are studying neuroendocrine function related to reproduction in transgenic animals overexpressing GH, in animals with congenital GH deficiency, and in animals with selective immunoneutralization of GH. The results indicate that GH acts on the hypothalamus to alter dopaminergic and noradrenergic control of prolactin and gonadotropin release. Life-long elevation of GH levels outside the physiological ranges disrupts feedback control of luteinizing hormone (LH) release by gonadal streroids. Plasma LH and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels and feedback control of LH release are also abnormal in GH-deficient animals indicating that physiological levels of endogenous GH are normally involved in the control of gonadotropin release. Differences between the effects of bovine vs. human GH in transgenic mice and differential effects of GH deficiency in mice and rats should facilitate identification of the mechanisms involved in the actions of GH on the hypothalamic-pituitary system.",

The present study aimed to investigate the fate of MAP-2 after administration of trimethyltin (TMT), an environmental neurotoxin. An immunocytochemical staining was performed in the hippocampus, known to be the most vulnerable brain region after TMT exposure. Prolonged survival time (21 days) following i.p. injection of a single dose of TMT (8 mg/kg) led to a considerable changes in intensity and pattern of distribution of MAP-2 immunoreactivity within the structure. A significant decrease in the staining was observed in the hippocampus proper especially in CA4/CA3 and CA1 subfields. This decrease was correlated with the severity in pyramidal cell loss previously reported by others. On the contrary, an increased density of MAP-2 immunostained dendrites was found in the molecular layer of dentate gyrus. Since TMT has been recognized as an agent damaging not only the hippocampus but also other limbic structures, the latter result might be interpreted in terms of postsynaptic changes due to hippocampal deafferentation.",

Physostigmine, carbachol and nicotine were intraperitoneally applied on 7 rats. Several VEP parameters were found changing in dependence of the arousal level: the VEP latency, the amplitude of the second negative component (N41), and the voltage of the positive component between 60 and 80 ms after the light flash. Physostigmine caused amplitude alterations like during high arousal states. The VEP latency, however, was altered in an opposite way. Nicotine specifically altered the N41 amplitude whereas carbachol delayed the latency of the VEP. The second negative component (N41) is assumed cholinergically modulated. Moreover, the negative component between 60 and 80 ms latency that emerged in high arousal states may be cholinergically generated and may represent a marker of the activation degree of the cholinergic system.",

The area depended mainly on the amplitude of contraction and to a smaller degree on its time course. The measure of area under the tension record gives a more exact evaluation of the work performed by contracting motor units than the measure of tension alone.

We postulated that \"the contralateral facilitation effect\", which may reflect the yet unexplored mechanism of immediate compensation after acute unilateral brain injury, is attributable to the A10 DA neurons and their regulatory inputs. The present study was aimed at examining the possible involvement of NMDA-mediated glutamatergic transmission in VTA in the \"contralateral facilitation effect\". The behavioral model of the VTA stimulation-induced feeding in rats was used. Latency to eat was measured as a function of stimulation frequency before and after unilateral intra-VTA injection of non-competitive NMDA receptors antagonist, MK-801, (doses 0.0, 1.25 and 2.5 micrograms), MK-801 caused a dose-dependent augmentation of feeding evoked by stimulation of the contralateral VTA, which manifested as a decrease in the reaction frequency threshold and a leftward shift of the latency/frequency curve. Dose 2.5 micrograms replicated the facilitatory effect of electrolytic and 6-OHDA lesions. The results are interpreted in terms of MK-801-evoked depression of excitatory glutamatergic tone over A10 DA cells and compensatory increase in DA release in the contralateral hemisphere.",

Both time- and space-dependent processes have been identified in animals through computer-based analytic quantifications of event-related extracellular potentials. New nonlinear analyses have been introduced that presume that the fine-grain variation in the signal is determined and patterned in phase-space. Some neurons in the primary visual cortex manifest gamma-band oscillations. These cells show both a nonspecific phase-alignment (response synchrony) and a specific tuning (orientation tuning) when stimuli are presented to their receptive fields. This dual regulation of the sensory cells is proposed to underlie stimulus binding, a theoretical mechanism for \"object\" perception. Nonlinear analytic results from gamma-activities in a simple model neuropil (olfactory bulb) suggest that neuroplasticity may arise through self-organization, a process in which a nonlinear change in the dynamics of the oscillatory field potentials is the hallmark. This self-organization may follow simple dynamical laws in which global cooperativity among the neurons is transiently brought about that, over trials, results in enduring changes in the nonlinear dynamics of some neurons. In conclusion, the sculpturing of the synaptic throughput in the sensory cortex (stimulus binding) may be associated with the irregular phases of the gamma-activities and may result from both specific and nonspecific systems operating together in a nonlinear self-organizing manner.",

The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of autoimmune reaction induced by post-traumatic vaccination with myelin self-antigen on spontaneous regeneration of dopaminergic neurons, injured with MPTP. C57BL mice were intoxicated with 40 mg/kg MPTP and seven days later immunized with MOG 35-55 peptide in CFA. On the 7th day following intoxication, the MPTP treated mice showed decrease of the dopamine level by 63% as compared to the control mice. However, starting from the 14th day following intoxication, a spectacular increase of dopamine content was observed. Immunization with MOG resulted in a statistically significant reduction of the increase in striatum as compared to non-immunized animals, and was lower by 23%, 17% and 15% on days 14, 28 and 50, respectively. Our results show suppressive influence of autoimmune reaction induced after injury on regeneration of dopamine cells intoxicated with MPTP.",

    "abstract": "Neurophysiologists often use histograms to explore patterns of activity in neural spike trains. The bin size selected to construct a histogram is crucial: too large bin widths result in coarse histograms, too small bin widths expand unimportant detail. Peri-stimulus time (PST) histograms of simulated nerve fibers were studied in the current article. This class of histograms gives information about neural activity in the temporal domain and is a density estimate for the spike rate. Scott's rule based on modem statistical theory suggests that the optimal bin size is inversely proportional to the cube root of sample size. However, this estimate requires a priori knowledge about the density function. Moreover, there are no good algorithms for adaptive-mesh histograms, which have variable bin sizes to minimize estimation errors. Therefore, an unconventional technique is proposed here to help experimenters in practice. This novel method maximizes the entropy of histogram-bar heights to find the unique bin size, which generates the highest disorder in a histogram (i.e., the most complex histogram), and is useful as a starting point for neural data mining. Although the proposed method is ad hoc from a density-estimation point of view, it is simple, efficient and more helpful in the experimental setting where no prior statistical information on neural activity is available. The results of simulations based on the entropy method are also discussed in relation to Ellaway's cumulative-sum technique, which can detect subtle changes in neural activity in certain conditions.",

    "abstract": "Active touch involves tactile and proprioceptive sensory inputs, activation of the motor system and executive functions. It has been shown by the previous literature that active touch facilitates shape recognition. Since both active and passive exploration requires sequential presentation of the tactile inputs, this facilitation may be due to the improvement of the sequentialprocessing mechanism. The effects of active and passive touch on the sequential processing of tactile inputs were tested at different stimuluspresentation rates in a counting task. Active touch did not improve the performance, which shows that the additional sensory and motor information conveyed by active exploration are not utilized by the sequential-processing mechanism. Therefore, the results cannot be explained by the feature-specific theory of sequential processing. On the other hand, the counting errors were higher than those predicted by the limitation of the minimal inter-stimulus interval, which is suggested by the central-timing theory. Consequently, it is proposed that a mechanism based on the central-timing theory may contribute to tactile sequential processing, but the bottleneck at high presentation rates is probably due to short-term memory.

TVS are spheres or short rods of approximately 27 nm in diameter. That size of TVS is also the size of filter cut-off of infectivity as judged from the ultrafiltration studies and the size of the smallest infectious unit as recently estimated. TVS have been found in all naturally occurring and experimentally induced prion diseases, including variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and human familial TSEs - fatal familial insomnia and Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker disease. In longitudinal studies, the number of neuronal processes containing TVS correlates roughly with the incubation period and with infectivity. Hence, they are readily found in hamsters infected with the 263K strain of scrapie but it is very difficult to find them in human TSEs where titer is lower. The composition of TVS is unknown but they are not composed of PrP. Their consistent presence in all TSEs suggests the unexplained role at least of TSE pathogenesis.",

This paradigm allowed us to adopt into the KC studies a method of signal analysis that provides time-frequency maps of statistically significant changes in signal energy density. Our results indicate that KCs and sleep spindles may be organized by a slow oscillation. Accordingly, KCs might be evoked only if the stimulus occurs in a certain phase of the slow oscillation.

Contrarily, in the open field IS rats (both lesioned and control) traveled a longer distance, showed less habituation and spent less time resting at the home base than the EE animals. Unlike the EE lesioned animals, the lesioned IS rats, presented a tendency to hyperactivity in postinjury period. Turning tendency was significantly affected by unilateral brain lesion only in the EE rats.

One hour after each of these injections bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a marker of dividing cells was also injected. Two months later, when newly generated neurons settled in the OB and matured the ability of these opossums to detect hidden food by olfactory cues was tested. Afterwards, numbers of BrdU-labeled cell nuclei in their OB were counted and a phenotype of labeled cells established. In all groups investigated the majority of new cells differentiated into neurons (55-76%) and a lower proportion into astroglia (6-12%). Numbers of BrdU-labeled cells differed depending on the applied treatment: both agonists of the 5HT1A receptor increased these numbers, while its antagonist decreased them. The increased number of new OB interneurons did not change the time required for finding all three food items and therefore did not improve the opossums' performance in this test of the olfactory perception. However, opossums that had the reduced number of new generated OB cells searched longer for each food item and in consequence took three times longer to find all three crickets, than did opossums from other groups. In conclusion, lower numbers of new neurons in the opossums OB correlated with their worse behavioral performance in a test based on olfactory perception.",

Sleep fragmentation can trigger inflammatory mechanisms. The aim of this research was to investigate the effects of chronic sleep fragmentation on seizure susceptibility and brain cytokine profile. Chronic sleep fragmentation in male rats with implanted EEG electrodes was achieved by the treadmill method. Rats were randomized to: treadmill control (TC); activity control (AC) and sleep fragmentation (SF) group. Convulsive behavior was assessed 14 days later by seizure incidence, latency time and seizure severity during 30 min following lindane administration. The number and duration of EEG ictal periods were determined. Levels of IL-1β and IL-6 were measured in the animals’ serum and brain structures (hippocampus, thalamus and cerebral cortex), in separate rat cohort that underwent the same fragmentation protocol except lindane administration. Incidence and severity of seizures were significantly increased, while latency was significantly decreased in SF+L compared with TC+L group. Seizure latency was also significantly decreased in SF+L compared to AC+L group. The number and duration of ictal periods were increased in the SF+L compared to the AC+L group. IL-1β was significantly increased in the thalamus, cortex and hippocampus in the SF compared to the AC and TC groups. IL-6 was statistically higher only in the cortex of SF animals, while in the thalamic or hippocampal tissue, no difference was observed between the groups. It could be concluded that fourteen-day sleep fragmentation increases seizure susceptibility in rats and modulates brain production of IL-1β and IL-6.",

In this study, we investigated the therapeutic influences of artemisinin and TSP-1-human endometrial-derived stem cells (TSP-1-hEDSCs) on the streptozocin-induced model of AD and diabetes in rats. Hippocampal and intraperitoneal injections of streptozocin were used to induce AD and diabetes in male Wistar rats, followed by intranasal administration of a single dose of TSP-1-hEDSCs and intraperitoneal administration of artemisinin for 4 weeks. Hematoxylin together with eosin staining was performed for demonstrating Aβ plaque formation and for analyzing the influence of treatments on the pyramidal cells in the hippocampus. Biochemical analysis was used to assay the serum levels of glucose, MDA, ROS, and TAC. The expression of TNF-α was measured using real-time PCR. Streptozocin induced AD and diabetes via Aβ plaque formation and increasing blood glucose levels. It also increased the levels of ROS, MDA, and TNF-α and decreased the levels of TAC. Simultaneous or separate administration of artemisinin and TSP-1-hEDSCs ameliorated this influence by considerably reducing Aβ plaque formation in the hippocampus, reducing glucose, MDA, ROS, and TNF-α levels, and increasing TAC levels. It appears that artemisinin and TSP-1-hEDSCs improve the adverse features of AD in a rat model of AD and diabetes. Therefore, artemisinin and TSP-1-hEDSCs could be utilized as an adjunct treatment, as well as a protective agent, in AD patients.",

The aim of our study was to investigate the effectiveness of the GON block in the treatment of headaches observed in COVID‑19 patients. Between March and May 2020, 27 patients (with laboratory‑confirmed 2019‑nCoV infection by next‑generation sequencing confirmation of real‑time PCR) that had moderate or severe headache associated with COVID‑19 and treated with a single session of GON block were retrospectively analyzed.

Fifteen (55.6%) patients included in the study were male and twelve (44.4%) were female. In terms of VAS values, the difference between pre‑treatment and post‑treatment values on the 1st and 10th days was found statistically significant. Likewise, the difference between analgesic use before and after the procedure was statistically significant. GON block appears to be an effective pain management method in COVID‑19 related headache, and it revealed promising reductions in pain scores and analgesic usage. As well as we know, this is the first study of \"COVID‑19 associated headache treated with GON blockade\".

Using ELISA assay we analyzed CSF Abeta42, t-tau and p181-tau levels among clinically diagnosed non-demented individuals, AD patients and individuals with uncertain dementia (n=36). CSF cut-off values of low Abeta42 (less than or equal to 530 pg/mL) and high t-tau (less than or equal to 350 pg/mL) or p181-tau (less than or equal to 52 pg/mL) were used to identify individuals with AD/MCI-CSF profile, regardless of clinical diagnosis. APOE genotyping was performed using PCR-RFLP method. In accord with previous studies we detected significantly decreased levels of CSF Abeta42 and increased tau and p181-tau levels in clinically diagnosed AD group vs. non-demented controls. CSF profiling identified individuals with a typical AD/MCI-CSF pattern in clinically referred non-demented group (9 percent) and among patients with uncertain dementia (41.7 percent). APOE epsilon4-allele was associated with the CSF biomarker changes typical for AD.

Moreover, there was a positive correlation between the dosages of Met allele and attentional disengagement, however, we did not observe any significant influences of BDNF Val66Met on personality traits. These preliminary results indicate that the individual differences in attentional bias for positive words are partially underpinned by BDNF.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the sequence learning performance of 16 non-demented patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) was compared with 18 age-matched healthy controls on a verbal version of the serial reaction time (SRT) task intended to encapsulate both visuomotor- and judgment-linked learning processes. Visuomotor sequence performance in PD patients was closely related to baseline response speed, with robust learning demonstrated by patients who responded with comparable speed to controls but severely impaired performance in patients who responded slowly. In contrast, both fast- and slow-responding PD patients were able to successfully categorise patterns according to their sequential status, a performance that was linked to declarative memory for the sequence. The findings highlight the important role of event timing in SRT performance and are in accord with the hypothesis that, despite the important role played by the basal ganglia in motor sequence learning, basal ganglionic dysfunction may not substantially impair sequence order learning so much as the translation of sequence knowledge into rapid motor performance for some PD patients. Intact pattern judgment on the SRT experiment suggests that the integrity of the neostriatum is not essential for learning judgment-linked categorical information about sequences of temporal stimulus movement.",

The study showed that unilateral VTA lesion increased (as compared to Sh group) the number of ChAT+ neurons in the Ch1-Ch3 and unilateral VTA stimulation increased the number in the Ch1 and the ventral pallidum only. The most sensitive to these changes in the mesolimbic system were cholinergic structures providing hippocampal afferentation.

Three different stimulus parameters (the length, internal angle, or tilt angle of the wings) were used as independent variables in different series of experiments. It was demonstrated that the magnitude of perceptual displacements of stimulus terminator is commensurate with that of illusions of extent obtained in our previous studies of full versions of illusory figures. Good correspondence between the experimental data and the predictions of our computational model of automatic centroid extraction strongly supported the suggestion that the effects of centroid extraction are powerful enough to be considered as one of the main causes of illusions of extent of the Müller–Lyer type.",

One of the brain areas innervated by LC neurons is the amygdala, a structure highly involved in emotional processes and memory formation. The aim of this study was to increase knowledge of the functional connectivity between the LC and the amygdala subnuclei. To reach this objective, we evaluated c-fos immunoreactive cells in amygdala nuclei following direct electrical stimulation of the LC in conscious animals. This analysis of c-Fos immunoreactivity could inform whether there are differences in activity of the amygdala subnuclei related to LC electrical stimulation in conscious animals. Our results showed a marked increase in c-fos activity in these amygdala subnuclei both ipsilateral and contralateral to LC electrical stimulation in vivo. Therefore, our study provides evidence that in vivo electrical stimulation of LC is able to activate the amygdala subnuclei as measured by c-fos expression.",

Neural stem cells (NSCs) are multipotent progenitor cells that can differentiate into neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes under certain conditions. In our recent report, using an antibody that can recognize both BMP-2 and BMP-4 (BMP-2/4), we showed that BMP-2/4 is only expressed in astrocytes differentiated from NSCs in a medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS). In this in vitro model, the astrocytic differentiation of NSCs was mainly toward type-2. When NSCs were cultured in a medium containing 10% FBS, most of the cells differentiated into type-1 astrocytes. However, little information is available for BMP-2 and BMP-4 expression in type-1 and type-2 astrocytes induced from NSCs under these different culture conditions. In this study, using two antibodies specific for BMP-2 and BMP-4, respectively, we discriminated the presence of BMP-2 and BMP-4 in NSCs and their derivatives under 1% and 10% FBS culture conditions by RT-PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence staining. We found that BMP-2 and BMP-4 are highly expressed in both type-1 and type-2 astrocytes, and no detectable expression in NSCs, neurons and oligodendrocytes. This suggests that the astrocytes might be one source of BMPs during the differentiation of NSCs.

ASDs disproportionately affect male children. Mercury (Hg), a heavy metal, is widespread and persistent in the environment. Mercury is a ubiquitous source of danger in fish, drugs, fungicides/herbicides, dental fillings, thermometers, and many other products. Elevated Hg concentrations may remain in the brain from several years to decades following exposure. This is important because investigators have long recognized that Hg is a neurodevelopmental poison; it can cause problems in neuronal cell migration and division, and can ultimately cause cell degeneration and death. Case-reports of patients have described developmental regressions with ASD symptoms following fetal and/or early childhood Hg exposure, and epidemiological studies have linked exposure to Hg with an elevated risk of a patient being diagnosed with an ASD. Immune, sensory, neurological, motor, and behavioral dysfunctions similar to traits defining or associated with ASDs were reported following Hg intoxication with similarities extending to neuroanatomy, neurotransmitters, and biochemistry. The sexual dimorphism of ASDs may result from synergistic neurotoxicity caused by the interaction of testosterone and Hg; in contrast, estrogen is protective, mitigating the toxicity of Hg. Mercury exposure may significantly increase androgen levels, and as a result, patients diagnosed with an ASD may significantly benefit from anti-androgen therapy. Finally, the clinical geneticist has a wealth of biomarkers to evaluate and treat patients diagnosed with an ASD.",

Moreover, Muscimol or Bicuculline were respectively topically injected to the L4 DRG at the time of nerve injury and post-operative 5 days (POD5). The pain thresholds of hind paw were recorded. We found that the incidence and amplitude of GABA currents significantly decreased in the large and medium L4 DRG neurons after SNL (P less than 0.05). Furthermore, in the L5 SNL rats, 20 micrograms Muscimol injected immediately after injury caused a long-lasting attenuation of mechanical allodynia (P less then 0.05), whereas the thermal hyperalgesia was not alleviated (P greater than 0.05). 0.15 micrograms Bicuculline further decreased the pain thresholds (P less then 0.05) and reversed the pain-alleviating effects of Muscimol. However, at POD5, 20 micrograms Muscimol only exhibited transient alleviating effects (P less then 0.05). In conclusion, the decrease of inhibition signal mediated by GABA-A receptor in the adjacent intact DRG neurons may be crucial in the development of hyperalgesia in NPP.",

    "abstract": "Fear-conditioning is one of the most widely used paradigms in attempts to unravel the processes and mechanisms underlying learning and plasticity. In most of the Pavlovian conditioning paradigms auditory stimulus is used as a conditioned stimulus (CS), but conditioning can be accomplished also to tactile CS. The whisker-to-barrel tactile system in mice offers convenient way to investigate the brain pathways and mechanisms of learning, and plasticity of the brain cortex. To support a claim that an animal learns during conditioning session and that the plastic changes are associative in nature, objective measures of behavior are necessary. Multiple types of conditioned responses can develop, depending on the training situation, CS and unconditioned stimulus (UCS) characteristics. These include physiological responses, such as salivation, heart rate, galvanic skin reaction, and also behavioral responses, such as startle reflex potentiation or suppression of the ongoing behavior. When studying learning with the whisker system in behaving mice, stimulation of individual whiskers in a well-controlled manner may require animal restrain with a disadvantage of only limited behavioral responses observed. Stimulation of whiskers in the neck-restraining apparatus evokes head movements. When whiskers stimulation (CS) is paired with an aversive UCS during conditioning, the head movements decrease in the course of the training. This reaction, called minifreezing, resembles freezing response, frequently used behavioral measure, however applicable only in freely moving animals. This article will review experimental evidences confirming that minifreezing is a relevant index of association formation between the neutral CS and the and the aversive UCS.",

    "abstract": "Intradermal injection of pruritogens such as serotonin, histamine and compound 48/80 into the skin and then, the evaluation of the scratching behavior is the commonly used animal model to advance pruritic research and drug development. However, predictive validity of this model is poorly documented. There is a close interaction between itch and pain sensations with regard to mediation through an anatomically and functionally identical neuronal pathway. One approach is whether the existing animal model of itch differentiates itch or pain to show efficacy of clinically effective analgesic drugs as a back translation. In this study, we explored the effects of different group of analgesic drugs on serotonin and compound 48/80-induced scratching behavior in Balb-C mice. Serotonin (25 μg) and compound 48/80 (100 μg) was injected intradermally in a volume of 50 μl into the rostral part of skin on the back of male mice and scratches were counted for a 30-min observation period. Morphine (1, 3, 10 mg/kg), tramadol (20, 40, 80 mg/kg), cannabinoid agonist CP 55,940 (0.1, 0.3, 1 mg/kg), paracetamol (100, 200, 300 mg/kg) and diclofenac (50, 100, 200 mg/kg) were given intraperitoneally 30 min prior to pruritogen injection. The analgesic drugs dose dependently blocked serotonin and compound 48/80-induced straching behavior with exerting complete inhibition at certain doses. Our data suggests that intradermal pruritogen-induced scratching models may not discriminate pain and itch sensations and give false positive results when standard analgesic drugs are used.",

The expression of the HIF‑1α mRNA, miR‑20a‑5p, and kinesin family member 5A (KIF5A) mRNA was tested using qRT-PCR. Levels of the HIF‑1α, LC3I/II, P62, LAMP2, cathepsin B (CTSB) and KIF5A proteins were determined using western blotting. The CCK‑8 assay was conducted to assess PC12 cell viability. DQ‑Red‑BSA and LysoSensor Green DND‑189 dyes were employed to measure the proteolytic activity and pH of lysosomes, respectively. The interaction between miR‑20a‑5p and HIF‑1α or KIF5A was verified by performing chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and/or dual‑luciferase reporter assays. TUNEL staining was adopted to assess PC12 cell death. GFP‑LC3 and RFP‑GFP‑LC3 probes were used to examine the autophagy status and autophagy flux of PC12 cells. A rat middle cerebral artery occlusion‑reperfusion (MCAO/R) model was established to investigate the role of the HIF‑1α/miR‑20a‑5p/KIF5A axis in ischaemic stroke in vivo. OGD/R exposure initiated PC12 cell autophagy and injury. HIF‑1α expression was substantially increased in PC12 cells after OGD/R exposure. Overexpression of HIF‑1α reversed the effects of OGD/R on reducing cell viability, blocking autophagy flux and inducing lysosome dysfunction. These rescue effects of HIF‑1α depended on KIF5A. HIF‑1α negatively regulated miR‑20a‑5p expression by targeting its promoter region, and miR‑20a‑5p directly targeted and negatively regulated the KIF5A mRNA. Overexpression of miR‑20a‑5p abolished the effects of HIF‑1α on rescuing OGD/R‑induced injury in PC12 cells. The effects of the HIF‑1α/miR‑20a‑5p/KIF5A axis were verified in MCAO/R rats.

Moreover, knockdown of USP53 inhibited the activation of FK506‑binding protein 51 (FKBP51)/RhoA/ROCK signaling in CCI rats.

    "abstract": "Sleep disorder is a puzzling and complex health problem, and sleep deprivation (SD) may be a window for studying sleep disorder. Guipi decoction (GPD) is a classic Chinese prescription for the treatment of sleep disorder. However, the mechanism of GPD remains puzzling. In this paper, integrated pharmacological analysis and gene expression profiling were introduced to study the mechanism of GPD in treatment with SD. Firstly, the integrative pharmacology‑based research platform of traditional Chinese medicine (TCMIP) was applied to collect chemical compounds and corresponding targets for GPD. Secondly, SD‑related targets were obtained by gene expression profiling (GSE56931) from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The String database screened the core targets according to protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network. Furthermore, kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathways were carried out based on the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) database. Conclusively, the \"formula‑herbs‑compounds‑targets‑pathways\" network was established to explore the mechanism of GPD in the treatment of SD. In addition, molecular docking was carried out to verify the connection between hub compounds and targets. The results showed that GPD was mainly linked to 44 compounds, 19 targets and 5 pathways. GPD in the treatment of sleep deprivation through metabolic pathways and cAMP signaling pathway, which were related to NR3C1, MAPK3, PPARA and core compounds such as adenosine. This study preliminarily revealed the molecular mechanism of GPD for SD, and lays a foundation for the study of the mechanism against SD for GPD.",

    "abstract": "In the central nervous system, long‑term effects of a vagotomy include disturbance of monoaminergic activity of the limbic system. Since low vagal activity is observed in major depression and autism spectrum disorder, the study aimed to determine whether animals fully recovered after subdiaphragmatic vagotomy demonstrates neurochemical indicators of altered well‑being and social component of sickness behavior. Bilateral vagotomy or sham surgery was performed in adult rats. After one month of recovery, rats were challenged with lipopolysaccharide or vehicle to determine the role of central signaling upon sickness. Striatal monoamines and met‑enkephalin concentrations were evaluated using HPLC and RIA methods. We also defined a concentration of immune‑derived plasma met‑enkephalin to establish a long‑term effect of vagotomy on peripheral analgesic mechanisms. The data indicate that 30 days after vagotomy procedure, striatal dopaminergic, serotoninergic, and enkephalinergic neurochemistry was altered, both under physiological and inflammatory conditions. Vagotomy prevented inflammation‑induced increases of plasma met‑enkephalin - an opioid analgesic. Our data suggest that in a long perspective, vagotomized rats may be more sensitive to pain and social stimuli during peripheral inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Crocin and Terminalia chebula (T. chebula) were proven to have neuroprotective effects. In this study, we evaluated the preventive effects of crocin and alcoholic extract of the T. chebula alone and in combination to examine their efficacy against chronic restraint stress (CRS)‑induced cognitive impairment, anxiety‑like behaviors, hippocampal synaptic plasticity deficit as well as neuronal arborization damage in the hippocampal CA1 neurons. Over 14 consecutive days, animals received crocin, T. chebula, or their combination (5 min before CRS). The elevated plus‑maze results showed that crocin and T. chebula alone and in combination treatment significantly increased the time spent in open arms, percentage of open arm entries, and head dipping as compared with the CRS group. Barnes maze results showed that administration of crocin and T. chebula alone and their combination significantly improves spatial memory indicators such as distance traveled, latency time to achieving the target hole, and the number of errors when compared to the CRS group. These learning deficits in CRS animals correlated with a reduction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal CA1 synapses, which both T. chebula and crocin treatment improved field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) amplitude and fEPSP slope reduction induced by CRS. Golgi‑Cox staining showed that T. chebula and crocin treatment increased the number of dendrites and soma arbors in the CA1 neurons compared with the CRS group. Our results suggest that both T. chebula and crocin attenuated CRS‑induced anxiety‑like behaviors, memory impairment, and synaptic plasticity loss in hippocampal CA1 neurons. We found no significant difference between single treatments of T. chebula or crocin and their combination in protecting CRS‑induced anxiety‑like behaviors, memory impairment, and synaptic plasticity loss in hippocampal CA1 neurons.",

This study was designed to examine the effects of nicotine on the antidepressant and anxiolytic responses induced by citalopram and citicoline in mice. Anxiety‑ and depression‑related behaviors were assessed with the elevated plus maze and forced swim test, respectively. The results showed that subcutaneous administration of nicotine decreased open‑arm time (OAT) and open‑arm entries (OAE) but increased immobility time, suggesting anxiogenic‑like and depressive‑like effects. Intraperitoneal administration of citalopram increased OAT but decreased immobility time, indicating that citalopram induced anxiolytic‑like and antidepressant‑like responses. Additionally, an injection of citicoline increased OAE but decreased immobility time, revealing anxiolytic‑like and antidepressant‑like effects. Interestingly, the subthreshold dose of nicotine potentiated the citalopram and citicoline effects on OAT and immobility time, which revealed anxiolytic‑like and antidepressant‑like behaviors. Locomotor activity was not significantly changed by any doses of the drugs. In conclusion, these findings suggest that interactions between nicotine and citalopram or citicoline occur upon induction of anxiolytic and antidepressant responses in mice.",

There is little evidence for the neuroprotective effect of 1, 25‑dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25‑(OH)2D3) on various brain injury models. The aim of this study was to investigate the neuroprotection effect of 1,25‑(OH)2D3 against hyperoxia‑induced brain injury in premature rats. Sprague‑Dawley rats were exposed to 95% oxygen or room air for 24 h and treated with 1,25‑(OH)2D3 or normal saline for 14 consecutive days. The histopathological changes of optic chiasma tissue were observed by hematoxylin‑eosin staining. Immunohistochemistry, qRT‑PCR, and western blot were performed to detect the expression of integrin‑β1 and yes‑associated protein (YAP) in the organization of the optic chiasm. Histopathological sections of optic chiasma showed visible optic nerve swelling, expanded nerve fiber space, uneven staining, obvious oligodendrocyte proliferation and disordered cell arrangement accompanied by inflammatory cell infiltration and exudation after 7 days and 14 days of hyperoxia exposure. The hyperoxia group treated with 1,25‑(OH)2D3 were showed improvement of brain injury with reduced inflammatory exudation, uniform nerve fiber staining and less obvious oligodendrocyte proliferation. Immunohistochemical staining, qRT‑PCR and western blot indicated that 1,25‑(OH)2D3 treatment upregulated the expression of integrin‑β1 and YAP in the hyperoxia group on day 7. However, the expression of YAP was significantly increased compared with control group and treatment with 1,25‑(OH)2D3 reduced the expression of YAP in the hyperoxic group on day 14. 1,25‑(OH)2D3 may regulate the expression of integrin‑β1 and YAP to alleviate hyperoxia‑induced brain injury in premature rats.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy, especially the medial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), can result in cognitive impairment. Low‑frequency repetitive magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been verified to suppress neural excitability and reduce seizures. Given its potential in modifying cortical activity, we aimed to investigate its impact on cognitive function in the context of epilepsy, a condition where the use of rTMS has not been extensively explored. However, the influence on cognitive function has not yet been investigated. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of low‑frequency rTMS on cognitive improvement in epileptic rats. Rats used in this study were randomly divided into five groups: the sham group, the epilepsy group, and three epilepsy groups treated with rTMS at different frequencies. Each group underwent the Morris water maze test to investigate hippocampus‑dependent episodic memory, to evaluate their cognitive performance. Further assessments included patch clamp and western blot techniques to estimate the synaptic function in the hippocampus. Comparison between groups showed that low‑frequency rTMS significantly reduced spontaneous recurrent seizures and improved spatial learning and memory impairment in epileptic rats. Additionally, rTMS remodeled the synaptic plasticity affected by seizures and notably enhanced the expression of AMPAR and synaptophysin. Low‑frequency rTMS can antagonize the cognitive impairment caused by TLE, and promote synaptic connections.",

    "abstract": "Sevoflurane can produce toxicity to the hippocampal tissues of brain, leading to nerve damage, causing learning and cognitive dysfunction. CircRNAs have been indicated to act as a key mediator in anesthetic neurotoxicity. This study focused on the effect of circ_0016760 on sevoflurane‑induced neurological impairment. The GEO database (GSE147277) and RT‑qPCR were used to predict and measure the circ_0016760 expression. The interaction of circ_0016760 and miR‑145 was verified by dual‑luciferase reporter assay. The CCK‑8 assay, flow cytometry, ELISA, ROS kit, MWM test were carried out to measure the cell viability, apoptosis, inflammation indicators, ROS level, and cognitive and memory function of the rats. Sevoflurane exacerbated neurotoxicity by restraining cell viability, inducing cell apoptosis, neuroinflammation, and ROS generation, and causing learning and cognitive dysfunction. Circ_0016760 expression was increased in POCD patients from the GEO database and upregulated after sevoflurane exposure. miR‑145 was a target miRNA of circ_0016760. Silencing of circ_0016760 weakened the effect of sevoflurane on cell viability, cell apoptosis, inflammation‑related factors, oxidative stress, which could be reversed by miR‑145 inhibitor. The animal experiments results showed that circ_0016760 played a protective effect on regulating the cognitive behavior of sevoflurane‑treated aged rats, expression of inflammation cytokine, and oxidative stress factors through targeting miR‑145 in sevoflurane‑treated aged rat’s hippocampal neurons. Our results revealed that silencing of circ_0016760 attenuated sevoflurane‑induced hippocampal neuron injury by regulating miR‑145 expression, which may provide potential insights into the treatment of sevoflurane‑induced neurological impairment.",

    "abstract": "The pineal gland is a major component in the regulation of photoperiodic responses and hence, saisonality. All functions which appear to be controlled by the daylength can be influenced by modifying the output signal of the pineal gland, i.e. melatonin. An important property of the melatonin signal is that the duration of melatonin synthesis and release varies proportionally with the length of the night suggesting that the duration of elevated melatonin is the most important signal conveying the photoperiodic message. In addition to the temporal coordination of saisonal phenomena, melatonin appears to be involved in the control of circadian rhythms in mammals. Activity-rest cycles of rats can be entrained by infusion or injection of melatonin at appropriate times of the daily cycle. Rhythms of neuronal activity of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus can be inhibited and phase-shifted by application of melatonin. The firing rate of SCN neurones of rats can be inhibited by iontophoretic application of melatonin. These data are in good agreement with the high density of melatonin receptors found in the SCN of most--but not all-mammalian species. On the other hand, activity-rest cycles appear to be perfectly normal in animals which lack a daily melatonin rhythm. This, however, might be a laboratory artefact, and this system will probably fail when challenged in a complex situation.",

A complete set of half-saturation constants was establiblished for various substrate concentrations on both the external and the internal side of the membrane. Bisubstrate initial velocity analyses of the exchange reaction resulted in a kinetic pattern which is consistent with a sequential anti port mechanism.

    "abstract": "Transient cerebral ischemia induces, besides delayed neurodegeneration in selected brain structures, a number of early responses which may mediate ischemic injury/repair processes. Here we report that 5 min exposure to cerebral ischemia in gerbils induces a rapid inhibition and subsequent translocation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). These changes were partially reversible during a 24 h post-ischemic recovery. Concomitantly the total amount of the enzyme protein, as revealed by Western blotting (alpha-subunit specific), remained stable. This is consistent with our previous hypothesis, that the mechanism of ischemic CaMKII down-regulation involves a reversible posttranslational modification-(auto)phosphorylation, rather than the degradation of enzyme protein. The effectiveness of known modulators of post-ischemic outcome in counteracting CaMKII inhibition was tested. Three of these drugs, namely dizocilpine (MK-801), N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and ginkgolide (BN52021), all significantly attenuated the enzyme response to ischemia, whereas an obvious diversity in the time-course of their actions implicates different mechanisms involved.",

A brief mechanosensory stimulation evoked a train of spikes in an identifiable visceral sensory neurone. Interspike intervals within the train changed from short (tens ms) to long (s). Each spike elicited an elementary EPSP in an identifiable command neurone. The amplitude of elementary EPSPs varied during a train of action potentials. Initial high frequency depression was followed by posttetanic potentiation and subsequent low frequency depression. The result of integration of the three plastic processes has been named immediate plasticity. It has been shown that a compound EPSP elicited in a postsynaptic command neurone by a single sensory stimulus depends on the immediate plastic changes of elementary EPSPs.",

In the patients emerged an evident deterioration of attentional processes: much higher index of errors and longer reaction time than in the healthy subjects. On the other hand, in patients the following alterations in evoked potentials were found: (1) in the non-target condition lower amplitudes of components: left-sided P1, bilateral N1 as well as frontal P3a; (2) a distinct electrophysiological pattern of target detection, consisting of an increase in amplitudes of either N1 or P3a as compared to the response to the non-target stimulus. Electrophysiological features were related to behavioural data. An increase in the amplitude of N1 during detection of the target, as well as a lower non-target amplitude of P3a, correlated with poor CAT performance, while an increase in the amplitude of P3a during detection of the target correlated with relatively shorter reaction time, and showed no correlation with an index of errors. The results suggest an underlying primary hyperarousability at lower stages of visual data processing (up to N1 latency range) accompanied by several secondary pathological and compensatory mechanisms at the higher stages.",

In addition, these findings suggested that the frequency of the HPC theta was encoded in the PH and then was fed via the medial forebrain bundle to the medial septum and HPC. In the present study we attempted to verify this hypothesis with use of a different in vivo model--freely moving cats. The microinjection of the local anaesthetic, procaine, into the PH region reversibly suppressed the spontaneous as well as sensory and electrically induced HPC theta. However, in contrast to rats, in freely moving cats microinjection of procaine into the PH reduced the amplitude of the HPC theta but had no effect on theta frequency. We conclude that in freely moving cats the PH region comprises a critical part of the ascending brainstem pathway, for production of the HPC theta rhythm. In contrast to rats, in freely moving cats ascending inputs from the brainstem to the PH contribute mainly to the amplitude of the HPC theta rhythm.",

    "abstract": "The cerebral hemispheres differ in their capabilities and response to verbal versus nonverbal visual material. A priori, it might thus be expected that the right hemisphere would be best activated during a mnemonic task with fMRI when using nonverbalizable images, and the left hemisphere with verbal material. However, previous psychological tests had shown a high degree of similarity in measures of memory for these disparate items. It was thus hypothesized that extensive commonality in the areas activated would prevail when this previously tested material was employed with fMRI. Six subjects underwent fMRI with four types of trials in blocks: fixating; passively viewing 12 words and 12 nonverbalizable images; endeavoring to remember (encoding) another set of 12 words and images; endeavoring to recognize (retrieve) previously viewed words or images. Passive viewing produced small islands of activation in left versus right frontal cortex for words and images, respectively. Endeavoring to remember enlarged the areas of activation and produced some bilaterality. Retrieval greatly augmented activation as well as bilaterality, and some 20% of the activated frontal volume was shared by words and images. Thus, on the one hand, the distribution of activation upon retrieval differed substantially for words versus images, but on the other, as predicted, there was considerable commonality. Predominant laterality of activation in some areas shifted between encoding and retrieval (HERA), importantly involving different regions for words versus images. Of course, processes other than memory per se are undoubtedly involved in these distributions of fMRI activation in frontal cortex, yet the nature of the to-be-remembered items is clearly a major factor, in accord with the asymmetric lateralization in their basic representation.",

    "abstract": "The perirhinal cortex in the dog's brain is composed of two traditional Brodmann's areas: 35 and 36. Area 35 is situated along the entire rostro-caudal extent of the fundus of the posterior rhinal sulcus, whereas area 36 occupies its lateral bank. In this study, four subdivisions were distinguished in area 35 based on cytoarchitectonic differentiation. Area 36 is poorly developed in the dog’s brain and was divided into two subdivisions. The most characteristic features of area 35 are: a wide layer I, scattered cell clusters in layer II, and a prominent layer V containing a distinct population of large multiform neurons. Area 36 can be recognized by the presence of numerous cell clusters in layer II and increasing radial arrangement of neurons in deep layers of the area. Two fields of the postrhinal cortex were identified in the additional postrhinal gyrus, which is found in the fundus of the most caudal extent of the posterior rhinal sulcus.",

    "abstract": "The temporal reproduction of standard durations ranging from 1 to 9 seconds was investigated in monochannel cochlear implant (CI) users and in normally hearing subjects for the auditory and visual modality. The results showed that the pattern of performance in patients depended on their level of auditory comprehension. Results for CI users, who displayed relatively good auditory comprehension, did not differ from that of normally hearing subjects for both modalities. Patients with poor auditory comprehension significantly overestimated shorter auditory standards (1, 1.5 and 2.5 s), compared to both patients with good comprehension and controls. For the visual modality the between-group comparisons were not significant. These deficits in the reproduction of auditory standards were explained in accordance with both the attentional-gate model and the role of working memory in prospective time judgment. The impairments described above can influence the functioning of the temporal integration mechanism that is crucial for auditory speech comprehension on the level of words and phrases. We postulate that the deficits in time reproduction of short standards may be one of the possible reasons for poor speech understanding in monochannel CI users.",

Our results show that in the opossum, as in other marsupials, the peak of the retinal cells divisions occurs postnatally and that generation of retinal cells continues till the time of eye opening (P34), except of the marginal rim, where it continued till P60. Ganglion and amacrine cells are generated between postnatal days (P) P4 and P9, while bipolar cells and photoreceptors are generated simultaneously between P14 and P25. The peak of ganglion cell death as detected by the TUNEL method occurs around P14-19 in the center of retina. The second peak of apoptosis appears in the inner nuclear layer (INL) at P19-25. Gliogenesis takes place between P25 and P34. We also found that monocular enucleation performed during the early period of retinal development (P0-P7) did not influence proliferation, developmental apoptosis or other developmental processes in the retina of the remaining eye.",

When the luminance of the stripes increased or decreased, in comparison to the luminance of the background, length matching errors grew symmetrically and became approximately constant at higher contrasts.

Involvement of BDNF/TrkBFL in synaptic transmission raises the questions which intracellular compartments are involved in this upregulation and whether exercise leads to redistribution of these proteins related to the duration of exercise. We have investigated the influence of short-term (7 days) locomotor exercise (ST) on intracellular distribution of BDNF and TrkBFL in the rat lumbar spinal cord comparing it with the effects of long-term (28 days) exercise (LT) described earlier. Immunofluorescence (IF) of proteins was analyzed with confocal microscopy. ST exercise caused a redistribution of perikaryonal BDNF IF toward periphery resulting in an increase of dendritic signal. In contrast to an enhancement of perikaryonal BDNF staining following LT, no increase of BDNF IF in cell bodies was observed after ST. An increase of TrkBFL IF in oligodendrocytes was consistent with that caused by LT. The fibers of TrkBFL IF oligodendrocytes surrounding the largest neurons were in close apposition to neuronal membrane. We propose that ST exercise causes (1) BDNF translocation to dendrites and/or local dendritic synthesis to serve increased synaptic activity (2) sensitization of oligodendroglia to BDNF mediated responses.",

Findings from neurobiological studies indicate a relationship between the functioning of the human cerebral hemispheres and emotions. The aim of the present research was to examine: (1) the direction of influence on neutral targets of suboptimal primes exposed for a duration of 16 ms, (2) whether the influence of affective suboptimal primes on neutral targets depends on the hemisphere to which the prime is directed. We predicted that affective primes exposed centrally would influence the evaluation of neutral target stimuli in a direction opposite to that of their explicit effect. Second, we posited that the influence of primes on the evaluation of neutral target stimuli would be different depending on the visual field in which the primes were exposed. We present combined data from four experiments, conducted in a visual affective priming paradigm. Neutral target stimuli (ideographs exposed for a duration of 2 seconds) were sub-optimally primed by photographs of faces expressing joy or disgust exposed in either the LVF, RVF or CVF. Subjects were asked \"to state how negative/positive the character trait that is represented by a given ideograph is\". The hypotheses were supported. The evaluation of ideographs after negative priming was more positive than the evaluation of ideographs after positive priming (indicating a contrast effect). This effect appeared only when affective priming stimuli were exposed in the central visual field. The evaluation of ideographs differed depending on the visual field of prime exposure conditions: exposure of affective primes in the right visual field resulted in more positive evaluations of ideographs than ideographs following primes in the left visual field.",

The globus pallidus of the opossum consists of medial and lateral parts that are visible with Nissl or Timm's staining and also in PV and CR immunostained sections. Neurons of the globus pallidus expressing these proteins were classified into three types on the basis of size and shape of their soma and dendritic tree. Type 1 neurons had medium-sized fusiform soma with dendrites sprouting from the opposite poles. Neurons of the type 2 had medium-to-large, multipolar soma with scarce, thin dendrites. Cell bodies of type 3 neurons were small and either ovoid or round. Immunostaining showed that the most numerous were neurons expressing PV that belonged to all three types. Density of the PV-immunopositive fibers and puncta correlated with the density of the PV-labeled neurons. Labeling for CB resulted mainly in the light staining of neuropil in both parts of the nucleus, while the CB-expressing cells (mainly of the type 2) were scarce and placed only along the border of the globus pallidus and putamen. Staining for calretinin resulted in labeling almost exclusively the immunoreactive puncta and fibers that were distributed with medium-to-high density throughout the nucleus. Close to the border of globus pallidus with the putamen these fibers (probably dendrites) were long, thin and varicous, while more medially bundles of thick, short and smooth fibers predominated. Single CR-ir neurons (all of the type 3) were scattered through the globus pallidus. Colocalization of two calcium binding proteins in one neuron was. never observed. The CB-ir puncta (probably terminals of axons projecting to the nucleus) frequently formed basket-like structures around the PV-ir neurons. Therefore, the globus pallidus in the opossum, much as that in the rat, consists of a heterogeneous population of neurons, probably playing diversified functions.",

In three experiments, rats were exposed to a gustatory conditioned stimulus (CS) paired with cyclophosphamide (US), which induces immunosuppression and malaise. In Experiment 1, a single pairing of the CS with low, medium, or high doses of cyclophosphamide in separate groups produced no reliable conditioned immunosuppression even though conditioned taste aversion was observed in groups trained with high and medium doses of CY. Experiment 2 replicated the lack of effect following a single pairing of the CS with the medium dose of cyclophosphamide but demonstrated that three pairings are sufficient to induce conditioned immunosuppression. Experiment 3 demonstrated that significant immunosuppression is observable following a single CS-US pairing if the CS is presented in compound with a previously nonreinforced CS during training, an effect reminiscent of supernormal conditioning. These findings indicate that conditioned immunosuppression effects can be enhanced in magnitude through the use of certain procedural techniques.",

Inverse correlation was observed between whole cell acetyl-CoA level and fraction of nonviable cells at different combinations of lead and other neurotoxic compounds.

A rapid translocation from cytosol to membrane, and a proteolytic protein kinase C delta cleavage was found, probably due to activation of caspase-3, to give a catalytically active fragment involved in cellular apoptosis. Moreover, sphingosyl­phosphory1choline also induced translocation of protein kinase C zeta, resulting in an anti-apoptotic effect. To explore whether a mitochondrial pathway is involved in sphingosylphosphorylcholine-induced apoptosis, we analyzed the effect of sphingosylphosphory1choline on cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activity. We must point out that the sphingolipid caused an increase of cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytosol concomitantly with an increase of caspase-3 activity.

    "abstract": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a popular and effective treatment for drug resistant depression. However, there is considerable variability in clinical outcomes, in previous studies and between patients. Because of high requirements for the use of fMRI based neuronavigation, many practitioners of rTMS still choose to use a standard 5 cm rule for rTMS coil placement which leads to large variations in which brain regions are being stimulated. We decided to test the possibilities of a MNI based MR‑less neuronavigation system in rTMS depression treatment, by comparing the physiological effects and clinical outcomes of 3 distinct stimulation targets. Forty‑six patients (thirty‑three female, thirteen male) from the Republican Vilnius psychiatric hospital, all with drug resistant depressive disorder, participated in the study. All patients received high frequency (10 Hz) stimulation for 10 to 15 daily rTMS sessions. However, before the treatment they were randomly sorted into 3 groups according to stimulation target in MNI map: Group 1 received rTMS at point ‑40; 48; 35; Group 2 received rTMS at point ‑46; 45; 38; Group 3 received rTMS at point ‑38; 44; 26. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and clinical tests were obtained the day before the rTMS course and after the last session. There were some notable differences in physiological changes between the groups, with the largest EEG band spectral power increases found in Group 1 patients and the lowest in Group 2 patients. There was a significantly larger decrease of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) scores in the Group 3 (66.94%) compared to Group 1 (57.52%) and Group 2 (56.02%). This suggests it is possible to achieve higher clinical efficacy and less physiological impact on the brain when using different targets in a neuronavigated MNI based MR‑less rTMS system.",

The experiment was conducted in 20 healthy students (23.1±1.1 years, 10 women), using a 32 channel electroencephalography (EEG) montage system. The paradigm included geometric figures; a black square on a white background as a target and a white circle on a black background as a standard stimulus. We examined the maximal amplitude and latency of the P3b component at 18 electrode sites, as well as, temporal changes of scalp voltage distribution. We observed a non-equal spatial distribution of the visual ERP (event related potentials) waveforms on the scalp surface, with the highest P3b waveform observed over midline parietal areas and the lowest over frontal regions. Moreover, the spatial distribution of ERP signal on the scalp surface was more lateralized towards the right side in men and more centralized in women. Gender-related differences in P3b amplitude and latency were observed only in left hemisphere. Differences in P3b between men and women observed in our study arose not only from different P3b amplitudes and latencies, but also from the speed and character of P3b waveform fall, resulting in spatio-temporal amplitude changes. Moreover, the spatial distribution of the P200 potential also changed on the scalp differently in men and women. These results suggest that gender-related differences evoked in visual two-stimulus oddball paradigm, which engage attention processes, are complex and include spatio-temporal changes in P3b waveform generation, distribution, and suppression across the scalp.",

The rats were anesthetized and then administered 500 IU penicillin into the left cerebral cortex using a microinjector and electrocorticogram (ECoG) activity was recorded for 3 hours using a Power Lab data acquisition system. The frequency and the amplitude of the ECoG recordings were analyzed offline. Compared to the control group, spike frequency decreased significantly in all other groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of spike amplitude and latency. In this study, the effects of regularly administered treadmill exercise and L-tyrosine use on epileptiform activity were examined and evaluated together for the first time. The results of this study showed that regular exercise and L-tyrosine use decreased epileptiform activity. Further research and clinical trials are needed to investigate the extent to which L-tyrosine and physical activity interfere with the epileptic state by investigating different doses of L-tyrosine and different severity/ time/type of exercise protocols.",

    "abstract": "For years, interneurons expressing vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) interneurons and their function within the neocortex have been shrouded in mystery. Their relatively small size and minimal representation in the cortex have made investigation difficult. Due to their service role performed in co‑operation with glia and blood vessels to supply energy during neuronal activation in the brain, the contribution of VIP interneurons to local neuronal circuit function was not appreciated. VIP interneurons in the neocortex account for roughly 12% of all interneurons. They have been described as a subgroup of the third largest population of 5-hydroxytryptamine 3a (5HT3a) receptor‑expressing interneurons, non‑overlapping with interneuron populations expressing parvalbumin (PV) or somatostatin (SST). However, it was recently shown that only half of VIP interneurons display a 5HT3a receptor response and a subset of VIP interneurons in visual cortex co‑express SST. Over the last several years, due to new technical advancements, many facts have emerged relating to VIP interneuron phylogenetic origin, operational mechanisms within local circuits and functional significance. Some of these discoveries have dramatically shifted the perception of VIP interneurons. This review focuses on the function of the VIP interneurons residing in layer 2/3 of the mouse neocortex.",

This illusion of interrupted spatial extent is also known as the \\'filled‑space' or 'Oppel‑Kundt' illusion. Although the continuously filled‑space illusion has been systematically studied for over a century, there is still no generally accepted explanation of its origin. The present study aimed to further develop our computational model of the continuously filled‑space illusion and to examine whether the model predictions successfully account for illusory effects caused by distracting line‑segments of various lengths that are\\r\\nattached to different endpoints (i.e., terminators) of the reference spatial interval of the three‑dot stimulus. Our experiments confirm that the illusion manifests itself along a distracting segment located both inside and outside of the reference interval. In the case of two distractors arranged symmetrically with respect to the lateral terminator, we found that the magnitude of the illusion is approximately equal to the sum of the relevant values obtained with separate distractors. The results of experiments using vertical shifts of distractors supported the model's assumption regarding the two‑dimensional Gaussian profile of hypothetical areas of weighted spatial summation\\r\\nof neural activity. A good correspondence between the experimental and theoretical results supports the suggestion that perceptual positional biases associated with the context‑evoked increase in neural excitation may be one of the main causes of the continuously filled‑space illusion.",

The effects of such stimulation, however, may also favor seizure activity. Our goal was to investigate the effect of cerebellar electrical stimulation (ES) alone and in combination with the anti-epileptic drug diazepam (DIA) on seizure outcome. We used a rat model of pentylenetetrazol kindling, which is characterized by seizures followed by deteriorations in central benzodiazepine-GABAA (BDZ-GABAA) receptors. We tested the effects of ES alone and in combination with DIA (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg) on seizures. Our data demonstrated: 20 ES trials can prevent the recurrence of clonic-tonic kindled seizures, administration of either DIA-0.1 or ES (5 trials) alone is ineffective on seizures, and combining DIA-0.1 and 5 ES or DIA-1.0 and 5 ES caused an additive effect, prolonged the latency to seizure onset, and prevented recurrence of clonic-tonic seizures. We also observed that ES alone produced either facilitation or inhibition of seizures on EEG. In contrast, the same ES inhibited EEG seizures when delivered after a combination of DIA-1.0 and 5 ES and ultimately prevented the facilitation of the discharges. Lastly, we demonstrated that seizure suppression is intensified when cortical ES is performed after DIA administration. Our data supported the hypothesis that both BDZ-GABAA receptor activity along with cerebellar output comprise the potential mechanisms underlying the peculiar effects of deep brain stimulation in the cerebellum on seizures.",

The study was conducted on male Wistar rats using non-stressed and stressed groups (chronic restraint stress).

The obtained results confirm the antidepressant efficacy of used drugs upon both single and chronic administration and potential efficacy of these drugs administered in combination with stressed rats.

Dapoxetine and vortioxetine have an antidepressant and stress relieving effect on rats subject to chronic stress both in monotherapy and in combined therapy.

    "abstract": "The neurotrophic hypothesis of depression, which suggests that decreased hippocampal brain‑derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels cause depression, has become increasingly popular. BDNF, a member of the neurotrophin family,\\r\\npromotes neuronal differentiation and survival. BDNF is synthesized in various peripheral tissues, as well as in the brain. Considering that peripheral BDNF can be transported into the brain across the blood‑brain barrier, substances with the ability to upregulate BDNF activity in peripheral tissues may be useful in the management of depression. Previously, we demonstrated that the human kidney adenocarcinoma cell line ACHN produces BDNF; hence, this cell line was employed for screening upregulators of peripheral BDNF. Here, we aimed to identify Kampo (traditional Japanese) medicines and their crude drug components that upregulate BDNF levels using ACHN cells. Chotosan, Hochuekkito, Kososan, and Ninjinyoeito, Kampo medicines used in treating psychiatric disorders, increased BDNF levels in the culture media of ACHN cells.\\r\\nFurthermore, Chinpi (Citrus unshiu peel), a crude drug contained in these four Kampo medicines, as well as Onji (Polygala tenuifolia root), and Saiko (Bupleurum falcatum root) elevated BDNF levels in ACHN cells. Chinpi, showing strong BDNF elevating effect, increased BDNF mRNA expression. Inhibitors of protein kinase B, mitogen‑activated protein kinase kinase, and cAMP‑dependent protein kinase, involved in the transcription of BDNF, attenuated Chinpi‑induced BDNF elevation. Our results suggest that Chinpi and Kampo medicines containing Chinpi can promote the production of BDNF in peripheral tissues, potentially alleviating depression symptoms.",

This research aims to explore the function and mechanisms of LA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‑induced PC12 cells. PC12 cells stimulated by LPS were used to mimic an in vitro inflammatory model of Parkinson's disease. Cell toxicity was determined by a cell counting kit‑8 assay after various treatments. The concentrations of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)‑1β and IL‑6 were analyzed by an ELISA kit. The effects of LA on cell apoptosis and cell cycle were measured by flow cytometry. The levels of α‑syn, Nurr1 and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) were tested by immunocytochemistry and ELISA kits. Western blotting assays were used to measure the expression of NF‑κB pathway‑related proteins. In PC12 cells, 100 μmol/mL LA effectively attenuated the upregulation of TNF‑α, IL‑1β and IL‑6 triggered by LPS; inhibited the increase of cell apoptosis; and relieved the cell cycle arrest induced. Additionally, the increase in α‑syn and the decrease in Nurr1 and TH triggered by LPS were reversed by 100 μmol/mL LA. We also found that the elevated expression of p53 in LPS‑induced PC12 cells was suppressed by LA. Significantly, knockdown of p53 enhanced the ameliorative effect of LA on LPS‑triggered PC12 cell damage. The increase in levels of p‑p65 NF‑κB and p‑IκBα triggered by LPS were suppressed by LA and si‑p53 combination treatment. The results indicate that LA can attenuate LPS‑triggered inflammation and apoptosis in PC12 cells by targeting the p53/NF‑κB pathway. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the future treatment of inflammation in Parkinson's disease.",

Our results confirmed that in vitro differentiation of the umbilicalcord-blood-derived-neural-stem-cells (HUCB-NSC) coincides with the progressive down-regulation of Oct3/4 and Nanog gene expression. Consistently and in parallel with the repression of gene transcription, a substantial increase in the mosaic cytosine methylation CpG dinucleotide was observed in the promoter regions of these STF genes. However none of the histone-H3 post-translational-modifications (PTM) known to be associated with transcriptionally active genes (H3Ac and H3K4me3) or repressed genes (H3K9me3 and H3K27me3) seemed to vary in relation to the progression of cell differentiation and down-regulation of STF genes. This indicates an uncoupling between STF gene expression and above mentioned histone PTMs. In contrast, the overall methylation of nuclear chromatin at repressive histone H3K9me3 was significantly higher than H3K4 trimetylation in expanding HUCB-NSC cultures and then increases through the progression of cell differentiation. These observations suggest different epigenetic programs of gene repression realized in the cell nuclei of differentiating HUCB-NSC cultures with uneven involvement of the repressive histone PTMs.",

Female Wistar rats were studied in the Morris Water Maze (MWM) and locomotor activity test. Rats undergoing the MWM and locomotor activity test were injected with saline on day 1, 7, 14 and 21 of testing. Results showed a statistically significant mobility increase in the group of ethanol‑exposed females (CEt) (21 days) compared to the non-ethanol-exposed group (CNEt). Upon ARI administration to CEt, no statistically significant differences in animal mobility were found, either upon single or chronic administration. Chronic administration of FLU (21 days) as well as combined administration of ARI+FLU (14 and 21 days) caused a statistically significant reduction of the females' mobility compared to the control CEt group. Single and chronic administration of ARI (7x) both show a spatial memory improvement in CEt. No memory improvement was observed, however, after 14 and 21 days of ARI administration. FLU, likewise, improved spatial memory both upon single and chronic administration. Combined administration of ARI+FLU improved memory in CEt only upon single administration. Lack of effect upon chronic administration may be due to tolerance to memory improvement developing upon combined administration of ARI+FLU. It can be concluded that ARI (1.5 mg/kg), FLU (5 mg/kg), and combined administration of these drugs improves spatial memory in CEt.",

Latent learning is the acquisition of neutral information that does not immediately influence behavior, but can be recalled and utilized when it becomes relevant to the animal. Based on previous research, it was predicted that the LEC would be necessary for latent learning of non-spatial information, but would not be necessary for latent learning of spatial information. Forty-two male Sprague Dawley rats (Rattus norvegicus) were either given pretraining neurotoxic lesions restricted to the LEC or were given sham (SH) lesions. The rats were then trained and tested on two latent learning tasks: the Latent Cue Preference (LCP) task which assesses single-cue (non-spatial) latent learning and a spatial latent learning task utilizing a Barnes maze. Results showed that rats with LEC lesions were impaired on the nonspatial LCP task compared to SH rats, but showed no impairment on the spatial latent learning task. Therefore, the LEC appears to be selectively involved in processing non-spatial latent learning and does not process, or is at least not necessary for, spatial latent learning. These findings indicate a specific role of the LEC in information processing and provide new information about the function of the entorhinal cortex.",

Isoproterenol depolarized the membrane potential recorded from the soma. This effect was absent in the presence of metoprolol, suggesting the involvement of beta1-adrenergic receptors. The adenylate cyclase activator forskolin also depolarized the membrane potential. Moreover, the effect of isoproterenol was abolished by the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ 22536. This suggested that adenylate cyclase was involved in mediating the effect of the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist. The isoproterenol-induced depolarization persisted after inhibition of protein kinase A with H-89. The effect of beta-adrenergic receptor activation on the membrane potential was dependent on Ih channels because it was abolished in the presence of the Ih channel inhibitor ZD 7288. Dendritic recordings were also performed. In the dendritic segments between 100 microm and 150 microm from the soma and between 200 microm and 250 microm from the soma, isoproterenol also depolarized the membrane potential. The magnitude of the beta-adrenergic receptor-stimulated depolarization was the same in the soma and in both dendritic localizations.

    "abstract": "The afferent projection pattern from individual vibrissae follicles was related to the distribution of cytochrome oxidase (CO) dark cell clusters in the trigeminal sensory nuclei of adult rats to determine whether segregated primary afferent projections limit the extent of the topographic reorganizations that can occur at the level of the brainstem on a short term basis after changes in sensory driven activity. The results indicate that the projections to all the brain stem trigeminal subnuclei, including the principal sensory nucleus and the three subdivisions of the spinal trigeminal nucleus, are topographic; however, the extent to which label from different whisker rows overlap appears to differ from subdivision to subdivision. In the principal sensory nucleus there is nearly a one to one relationship between the inputs from the vibrissae follicles and the corresponding CO-dense clusters. Thus, little overlap of inputs from different vibrissae rows is likely. In contrast, in the pars interpolaris and, to a lesser extent, in the pars caudalis, inputs from individual vibrissae follicles extend beyond the appropriate CO-dark patch into adjacent whisker patches; thus, inputs to these subdivisions from different vibrissae likely overlap more extensively.",

In the present experiment we studied a possible involvement of PPN in feeding elicited by stimulation of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). It was found that bilateral electrolytic lesioning of the PPN affected VTA-elicited feeding. However, the effects were diverse and showed dependence on the localization of the lesion within the PPN area. Lesions localized anteriorly in the PPN impaired VTA feeding whereas those involving the middle portion of the nucleus facilitated electrically elicited food ingestion. A precise alignment of the lesion and the area activated at the site of stimulation appeared crucial for the effect of the lesion. The results indicate that PPN belongs to the central feeding circuitry and it contains both activating and inhibiting elements directed to the ventral tegmental area.",

A submissive position in predatory hierarchy produced an increase in concentration of NA in the hypothalamus, a decrease of DA, 5-HT, MHPG and MHPG/NA ratio in the hippocampus and a decrease of 5-HT in the prefrontal cortex in comparison with dominant cats. In the predatory test the social situation increased the concentration of DA and its metabolites in the hypothalamus of the submissive and dominant cats as compared to single cats. Additionally, a diminution of NA and MHPG concentration in the midbrain in dominant cats compared to single animals in the predatory situation was observed. The data obtained demonstrate a considerable differentiation in the effects of predatory aggression and predatory behaviour in a social situation on brain distribution of monoamines. The results indicate that predatory behaviour in single and paired cats is regulated by different catecholamine mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "This article reviews data concerning the action of opioidergic and monoaminergic system on LHRH secretion. Generally, in anestrous ewes beta-endorphin and/or corticoliberin significantly change extracellular concentrations of monoamine metabolites in the MBH-ME, but in estrous ewes both beta-endorphin and CRF alters also dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin levels. Responses of catecholaminergic and serotoninergic system in the MBH-ME to naloxone or CRF-antagonist depend, to a large degree, on the phase of reproduction. In anestrous ewes subjected to stressful stimuli an opiate receptor blocker, naloxone, and CRF-antagonist attenuate the stress - induced activity of catecholaminergic and serotoninergic system in the MBH-ME; in non-stressed animals they suppress only serotoninergic system activity in this structure. No clear explanation can be offered now for either differences in response of catecholaminergic and serotoninergic system in the MBH to beta-endorphin and CRF in various periods of reproduction or for differences in the responses of these systems to CRF antagonist and naloxone in non-stressed and stressed ewes. It has been suggested that the responses in monoaminergic system activity are highly dependent upon the physiological state of the animal and that beta-endorphin and corticoliberin may indirectly modulate LHRH and other hypothalamic hormone secretion by monoaminergic systems.",

Incubation for 2–42 h with various concentrations of lidocaine (0.006 mM, 0.6 mM, and 30 mM) reduced the number of cells exhibiting neurites. The effects were time- and dose-dependent.

In the present study the spectral analysis of EEG was applied in LH-lesioned rats and confronted with a standard visual scoring method. One-hour samples of hippocampal and cortical EEG were taken from the light part of the circadian cycle before and after electrolytic or sham LH damage. In half of the LH-lesioned rats a power spectral analysis was performed using a Fast Fourier Transform routine at 1 Hz bands from 0.5 to 25 Hz; in the other half, as well as in the sham-lesioned group, EEG records were visually scored for the amount of waking, slow wave sleep and paradoxical sleep. Significant hyposomnia effects were found in LH-lesioned rats. Power spectral analysis of hippocampal EEG revealed a significant increase in power density at 4-6 Hz and a reduction at 7-10, 14-17, 19-22 and 23-24 Hz. In neocortical EEG there was a significant increase in power density at 5-6 Hz band and a reduction at 7-8 Hz.

At the thoracic level their axons descended in lateral funiculi, mostly on both sides and only exceptionally contra- or ipsilaterally. However, bilateral projection to sacral segments was less frequent (25 neurones). It is concluded that axons terminate at different levels on both sides of the spinal cord and only part of them project bilaterally to S1/S2 segments. Conduction velocities calculated for all the axons varied from 38 to 80 m/s and were significantly slower for their distal parts. Therefore it is suggested that descending axons send collaterals at various spinal levels. The presented data indicate the importance of these neurones for interlimb coordination.",

The animals were tested in two experimental settings using approach (Setting 1) or bar-press (Setting 2) responses. At the early stages of training, the learning took more trials in Setting 2, which was caused by different instrumental response and/or different relationship among manipulanda, stimuli, and reward in these two settings. The performance of the final task did not differ between settings and showed a gradual decline with extended delays. No differences were found in responding patterns or in dynamics of learning. Therefore, we conclude that the auditory DMS, trained in either setting, offers a valuable and reliable tool for studies of neural substrate of auditory recognition memory. The detailed analyses of the dogs' behaviour will allow to evaluate the subtle effects of experimental manipulations in future experiments, and for many reasons the data obtained from these two settings may be combined in further analyses.",

In this study we employed EFEM to investigate the structure of cellular scaffolds in glioma C6 cell line. The cells were extracted with Triton X-100 that dissolves phospholipids in the membranes and removes most of cytoplasmic soluble proteins. The DNA and nuclear histones were removed with DNase I and high-salt buffer, respectively. The remaining cellular frameworks were temporary embedded in diethylene glycol distearate (DGD), sectioned and observed in transmission and scanning electron microscope after the removal of DGD. The predominant structure was the extensive meshwork of 10-20 nm filaments in the cytoplasm (cytomatrix) and 15-30 nm filaments in the nucleus (nuclear matrix). The 5 nm filaments, presumably corresponding to the actin filaments, were present in the cytomatrix, but not in the nuclear matrix. Moreover, the ultrathin (3 nm) filaments, connecting other cytoskeletal components were detected. Those are possibly identical with the previously described plectin filaments. For the first time we report the occurrence of ultrathin filaments in the nuclear matrix. Thus, in a addition to the well known cytoskeletal components (microtubules, intermediate filaments, actin microfilaments) EFEM showed a new type of filaments (the ultrathin filaments) in the cytomatrix and nuclear matrix. Further immunocytochemical studies are needed to determine the biochemical identity of the filaments observed in EFEM.",

The emotional state was influenced behaviorally with the use of Pavlovian aversive conditioning procedure, and pharmacologically by injections of the selected anxiolytics and anxiogenics. A signal of danger (DS)--light or tone, preceded tail-shock (excitatory trials), while a signal of safety (SS), respectively tone or light, overlapped last 3s of 5s DS and predicted an omission of this expected aversive event (inhibitory trials). To assess the stability of HR changes to DS and SS we analyzed whether and how the experimental conditions (modality and position of signals, the ratio of numbers of excitatory to inhibitory trials in the session) influenced HR. HR changes to DS were different in pattern, stability and direction when compared to HR changes in response to SS. Reactions to DS, although accompanied mainly by conditioned bradycardia, were not consistent and depended on experimental conditions. However, the SS always evoked conditioned tachycardia. Anxiolitycs--benzodiazepines (diazepam and midazolam) and buspirone--influenced HR in nonconsistent manner. Anxiogenics--PTZ and FG7142 were without significant effects on HR. HR could not be trusted therefore as direct index of pharmacologically induced emotional states.

Investigations were performed on fast fatigable (FF), fast resistant (FR) and slow (S) motor units of the rat medial gastrocnemius muscle. Stimulation of a motor unit with a series of nine trains of stimuli at a frequency from 10 to 150 Hz was used and tetani fused to a variable degree were recorded. For fast motor units the procedure was repeated twice and observations were made on potentiated tetani in the second series of stimulation. For each tetanus, the amplitude of the tension increase, the peak amplitude of the contraction, the contraction time and the half-relaxation time were measured in the last contraction of the tension recording. It was observed in all three types of motor units that the last contraction was prolonged in parallel with the increase of fusion of a tetanus. In this contraction, the contraction time slightly decreased whereas the half-relaxation time strongly prolonged. The prolongation of the half-relaxation time was the strongest in tetani of slow units. Moreover, for the last contraction in a tetanus, the rate of changes in tension were studied. The rate of increase in tension during the contraction decreased in parallel with the increase of fusion of a tetanus, whereas the maximal rate of the tension decrease during the relaxation was found in tetani with fusion indices of 0.79, 0.98 and 0.95 for FF, FR and S motor units, respectively. Changes in the time course of contractions in tetani fused to a variable degree can shed light on processes of summation of contractions in unfused tetani at the level of individual motor units.",

The assessment revealed that in group P-1.0 the behavioural response to AMPH and SCOP was significantly depressed. In rats of the P-0.5 group, however, the behavioural response to each of the drugs was increased.

All of these sequences were repeated until ejaculation. Ejaculation occurred in 95.8% of cases within one minute after the last intromission during copulation with the CF female. The results of this study indicate that: (1) the number of intromissions displayed during Phase 2 does not depend on the character of the copulatory behaviour displayed during Phase 1, (2) at least two intromissions are displayed before ejaculation, and (3) the tactile stimulation of the glans of penis plays a crucial role in the ejaculatory seminal reflex.",

It appeared that only the earliest sub-component of the first negative wave of the EPs resulted from peripheral input, while the rest of the potential’s negativity depended on cortical feedback. The latencies and amplitudes of EPs recorded at both nuclei were not significantly different, which might be attributed to urethane anesthesia.",

This is particularly so in the hippocampus, a principal neural target site for GCs. The purpose of this research was an assessment of the neuroprotective effect of ACTH (4-9) in degenerative changes of hippocampal neurons induced by synthetic GC - dexamethasone. Experiments were conducted on male Albino-Swiss mice. We studied the morphology of neurons in the dorsal hippocampus in slides stained with cresyl violet. Immunocytochemical analysis was carried out with the use of monoclonal antibody anti-MAP2 in order to detect alterations in the neuronal cytoskeleton. We also performed ultrastructural examinations of hippocampal neurons. Quantitative analysis of morphological changes was completed using a computer analyser of histological pictures. It was shown that dexamethasone administered in toxic doses evokes neuronal death in layer CA3 of the hippocampus. Results indicate that ACTH (4-9) shows protective effects in that model. Dexamethasone-induced damage to hippocampal pyramidal neurons (assessed by cell counts, immunocytochemical analysis of cytoskeletal alterations and ultrastructural studies) was significantly reduced in animals administered ACTH (4-9).",

    "abstract": "When, in the primeval sea, creatures first began to crawl, \"right\" and \"left\" came into being, yielding neuronal nets to control response to the sidedness of stimuli. In the half billion years of moving and sensing, two brains have evolved, the right and the left; and human experience now shows them to be roughly equivalent, potentially independent, conscious entities. This dramatic fact is evidenced by \"split-brain\" patients and by numerous cases of therapeutic removal of either hemisphere. Equally dramatic, of course, is that there is not the slightest sign of this duality in everyday experience, the right and left visual fields are seamlessly knit, and cross purpose is absent in the moment to moment operation of the two cerebral hemispheres. This unity is constantly synthesized by the 100,000,000 fibers passing from each hemisphere to the other; the vastness of that interchange emphasized upon comparison with the mere 1,000,000 fibers conveying all the visual world from each eye. With the large distances in the human brain some 100+ ms may commonly transpire for one hemisphere to send to and receive a response from the other. Efficiency thus demands that most neuronal calculation occur within rather than between hemispheres, thereby promoting differences in the characteristic capabilities of each alone, i.e., \"hemispheric specialization\". Despite this there is a bewildering bilaterality of activation revealed by fMRI for most cognitive tasks. In the absence of the forebrain commissures brainstem systems can be shown, in macaques, also to participate in the unification of behavioral result from the actions of the separated hemispheres. The system favors synthesis from congruent (visual) input to the two hemispheres; but in the face of incompatible hemispheric input, the two hemispheres are able to work out an accommodation in their control of subcortical systems.",

The effects of 2-DG on the ultrastructure of cortical neurons with particular emphasis on the morphology of the Golgi apparatus, and on brain bioenergetics assessed by in vivo 31P-MRS technique were also evaluated. Seven and a half hours after injection of 2-deoxyglucose a significant increase in brain cortex beta-APP expression, increased tau phosphorylation, and a marked relative expansion of the trans- part of the Golgi intracellular secretory pathway in cortical neurons has been found. The changes of beta-APP expression and tau phosphorylation appeared within 1 h after 2-DG application and continued for at least 24 h. However, brain 31P resonance spectra remained unchanged for up to 7.5 h after 2-DG. It is suggested that the increase of beta-APP expression represents a response of brain tissues to 2-DG-evoked biochemical stress, while tau hyperphosphorylation and the change in Golgi morphology may be secondary phenomena.",

The experimental group (n = 7) was receiving a high sodium diet (3.28% Na) and the control group (n = 7) a normal sodium diet (0.22% Na). After 8 weeks, subjects were chronically implanted with the lateral cerebral ventricle (LCV) cannulas and with the femoral artery catheters. Three series of experiments were carried out on the experimental and control groups. In each series mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded for 10 min before and 30 min after the LCV infusion. In series 1 artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) was administered (2 microl/15 s). In series 2 AVP was infused (20 ng/2 microl aCSF/15 s). In series 3 V1a receptor antagonist (V1 ANT), d(CH2)5[Tyr(Me)2,Ala-NH29]AVP, was applied (80 ng/microl aCSF/15 s). There was no difference in baseline MAP and HR between the experimental and control groups. LCV infusion of aCSF had no effect on MAP and HR. LCV infusion of AVP produced a significant increase of MAP, which was greater in the group on the high sodium diet than in the group on normal sodium diet. The experimental group showed a longer hypertensive effect of centrally applied AVP in comparison to the control. LCV administration of V1 ANT did not exert a significant effect on circulatory parameters. These results suggest that the prolonged high sodium diet does not induce hypertension in WKY rats, but it enhances the pressor function of the central vasopressinergic system.",

The influence of these phenomena was studied on three types of motor units: fast fatigable (FF), fast resistant (FR) and slow (S) in the rat medial gastrocnemius muscle. The motor units were isolated by a method of splitting of L5 ventral root into very thin bundles of axons which were electrically stimulated 10 times with repeated series of 10 trains of stimuli at duration of 500 ms and progressively increasing (1-150 Hz) frequency. The initial (the first series of stimulating trains), potentiated (the second series), as well as fatigued (the tenths series) force recordings were compared. The motor unit output was expressed as the area under the force-time record in response to one stimulus measured at a plateau phase of the tetanic force. The stimulation frequency when the force-time area per one pulse was maximal was accepted as the optimal frequency. In fast motor units, the maximal contractile output increased with potentiation and was reduced with fatigue, and the optimal frequency decreased and increased, respectively. Nevertheless, the fusion degrees of the optimal tetanic contractions were similar in initial state, potentiation and fatigue independently of the changes in force. The applied stimulation protocol had almost no influence on the mechanical activity of slow motor units. The study highlights the physiological importance of force potentiation induced by preceding contractile activity for the economy of motor performance. The observed changes of the optimal stimulation frequency are consistent with the known changes in the motor unit firing rates during voluntary activity when the two phenomena develop.",

Experiments were performed using Wistar male rats. Seven days before testing, a recording electrode was lowered in the CA1 region under chloral hydrate anaesthesia to record the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) in response to Schaffer collateral stimulation. Selective M2 receptor antagonists methoctramine and selective M1 receptors antagonist pirenzepine were intraperitoneally injected immediately after training. The effects on memory retention were examined using passive avoidance training. We measured latency of the first entry into a dark compartment of the chamber. fEPSP amplitude and slope ratio were measured before shock presentation, 90 min after the shock, and 24 hour after the shock. Methoctramine significantly impaired behavior in the passive avoidance test but pirenzepine did not induce any changes compared to control. Our results showed that pirenzepine but not methoctramine supressed the amplitude of fEPSPs. On the other hand, intracerebroventricular methoctramine administration impaired passive avoidance learning and increased the amplitude of fEPSP.",

Interestingly, some morphological and functional recovery from their teratogenic effects that take place during brain maturation. However, mechanisms that underlie this recovery are not fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to examine whether the postnatal attenuation of fetal alcohol - and maternal stress‑induced morphological and functional deficits correlates with compensatory changes in the expression/activation of the brain proteins involved in inflammation, cell survival and apoptosis. In this project, we investigated the hippocampus which belongs to the brain regions most susceptible to the adverse effects of prenatal ethanol exposure. Pregnant rat dams were administered ethanol (A) or isocaloric glucose solution (IC) by a gastric intubation during gestational days 7-20. The pure control group received ad libitum laboratory chow and water with no other treatment. The hippocampi of fetal-ethanol and control pups were examined at the postnatal day (PD)1, PD10, PD30 and PD60. Moderate fetal-ethanol exposure and prenatal intubation stress caused a significant increase in molecular factors relating to inflammation (iNOS) and cell survival/apoptosis pathways (PTEN, GSK-3 and ERK) at birth, with a rapid compensation from these developmental deficits upon removal of alcohol at PD10. Indeed, an increase in ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 activation at PD30 was observed with ethanol consumption. It indicates that the recovery process in A and IC brains started soon after the birth upon the ethanol and stressor withdrawal and continued until the adulthood.",

Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in the development of the nervous system and hypothyroidism during development of embryos leads to defects in the nervous system. This study aimed to survey the effects of rat neonatal CSF collected from induced hypothyroid mothers on differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs). We hypothesized that hypothyroidism affected levels of growth factor in CSF. To induce hypothyroidism, pregnant Wistar rats received methimazole at the third day of gestation. BM-MSCs were obtained from rat femurs and tibias and cultured in medium. CSF was collected from the cisterna magna of newborn rats, and cells were subsequently exposed to CSF with concentrations of 5,7, and 10 /100 (v/v) for 72 h. MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay and real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to quantify the cell viability and analyze the expression of neural markers, respectively. Our morphological studies showed that treatment with hypothyroidism CSF (HTH-CSF) resulted in a significant decrease in neurite growth and proliferation as compared to normal CSF (N-CSF). RT-PCR analysis also showed a significant decrease in expression of neural markers (i.e., Nestin, Neurod-1, NeuN) in cells treated with HTH-CSF as compared with the N-CSF group. The most effective concentration of CSF for BM-MSC differentiation was 5% (V/V). Our results showed a significant decrease in differentiation of BM-MSCs in the presence of neonatal CSF of hypothyroid mothers compared with neonatal CSF of healthy mothers. Thus, thyroid hormones are essential in neural development and hypothyroid defects can affect development of the neonatal brain.",

Physical exercise implies diverse actions on the neural tissue that promote neuron proliferation and survival.

In this study we evaluated the capacity of a moderate forced‑exercise routine to counteract the neurodegenerative effects of a hypothyroid condition induced during adulthood. Simultaneously with a chronic anti‑thyroid chemical treatment, a group of rats was forced to walk in a motorized wheel for 30 min daily five times a week. In four weeks of treatment the rats developed a plain hypothyroid condition that in non‑exercised rats was accompanied by a marked increase in the number of atrophic cells in all CA regions of the hippocampus. The forced‑exercise treatment did not counter the development of hypothyroidism and its signs, but it did prevent almost completely the associated neuronal damage in all CA regions. The forced exercise also improved the cognitive function in a spatial‑learning test.

To this end, we investigated the relationship between pain sensitivity in two pain tests (the ‘tail-flick’ and ‘flinch-jump’ tests) and a conditioned, fear-evoked, freezing response in rats. The results show that there was no correlation between: (1) the conditioned (associative) and the novelty-evoked (non-specific stress-related) fear response and (2) individual differences in pain threshold and fear responses. Furthermore, factor analysis did not group freezing in the conditioned fear test, individual footshock sensibility, or ‘tail-flick’ reaction to painful stimuli together.

The study aimed at further eliciting the contribution of cholinergic and nitrergic neurotransmission systems to modular nerve networks in different regions of Wistar rat anorectum. Electrical field stimulation (EFS, 0.8 ms, 40 V, 2, 5 or 10 Hz, 20 s), computerized mechanographic on-line setup and drugs were used to evaluate the motor responses of isolated rings from circular muscle of rectum (proximal, middle, and distal part), internal anal sphincter, and anal canal. Twitch-like frequency-dependent contractions, more pronounced in rectal preparations, characterized the modular motor responses of rectal circular muscle rings and anal canal. Depending on the frequency of stimulation, the motor activity of internal anal sphincter varied from deep long-lasting relaxation to initial short-lasting relaxation, followed by a contraction. Electrically-evoked responses of anorectal preparations were tetrodotoxin (0.1 microM)-sensitive. In the presence of atropine (0.3 microM) the contractions of rectal rings decreased, relaxation of internal anal sphincter increased and inhibition of the contractions of the anal canal occurred, followed by relaxation. During atropine treatment, NG-nitro-L-arginine (0.5 microM) increased the contractile responses and suppressed internal anal sphincter relaxations. L-arginine (0.5 microM) decreased the contractions and extended the relaxations of internal anal sphincter and anal canal. Our results suggest that cholinergic and nitrergic systems are not equally involved in modular nerve networks of various regions of anorectum. Cholinergic transmission is more expressed in distal rectum, underlying its contractile potency, while nitric oxide-dependent transmission(s) control the relaxation ability of the internal anal sphincter and anal canal.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic plasticity is a property of neurons that can be induced by conditioning electrical stimulation (CS) of afferent fibers in the spinal cord. This is a widely studied property of spinal cord and hippocampal neurons. CS has been shown to trigger enhanced expression of immediate early gene proteins (IEGPs), with peak increases observed 2 hour post stimulation. Chronic morphine treatment has been shown to promoteinduce opioid-induced hyperalgesia, and also to increase CS-induced central sensitization in the dorsal horn. As IEGP expression may contribute to development of chronic pain states, we aimed to determine whether chronic morphine treatment affects the expression of IEGPs following sciatic nerve CS. Changes in expression of the IEGPs Arc, c-Fos or Zif268 were determined in cells of the lumbar dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Chronic Morphine pretreatment over 7 days led to a significant increase in the number of IEGP positive cells observed at both 2 h and 6 h after CS. The same pattern of immunoreactivity was obtained for all IEGPs, with peak increases occurring at 2 h post CS. In contrast, morphine treatment alone in sham operated animals had no effect on IEGP expression. We conclude that chronic morphine treatment enhances stimulus-induced expression of IEGPs in the lumbar dorsal horn. These data support the notion that morphine alters gene expression responses linked to nociceptive stimulation and plasticity.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to evaluate the effect of changing attentional demands towards stimulation in healthy subjects on P50 potential-related high-frequency beta and gamma oscillatory responses, P50 and N100 peak amplitudes and their gating measures. There are no data showing effect of attention on P50 potential-related beta and gamma oscillatory responses and previous results of attention effects on P50 and N100 amplitudes and gating measures are inconclusive. Nevertheless the variation in the level of attention may be a source of variance in the recordings as well as it may provide additional information about the pathology under study. Nine healthy volunteers participated in the study. A standard paired stimuli auditory P50 potential paradigm was applied. Four stimulation conditions were selected: focused attention (stimuli pair counting), unfocused attention (sitting with open eyes), easy distraction (reading a magazine article), and difficult distraction (searching for Landolt rings with appropriate gap orientation). Time-frequency responses to both S1 and S2 were evaluated in slow beta (13-16 Hz, 45-175 ms window); fast beta (20-30 Hz, 45-105 ms window) and gamma (32-46 Hz, 45-65 ms window) ranges. P50 and N100 peak amplitudes in response to both S1 and S2 and their ratio were evaluated. The phase-locked P50 potential-associated gamma activity was attenuated during distraction tasks as compared to focused attention and an unfocused attention condition. The amplitudes and gating measures of P50 and N100 waves and beta activity were not sensitive to the competing distraction task performance. The use of a distraction task is not favorable when phase-locked gamma range activity is a key interest in auditory potential studies.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to investigate the involvement of opioidergic/nitrergic systems in the anticonvulsant effect of mefloquine, compared with chloroquine, in mice. Seizures were induced by pentylenetetrazol and maximal electroshock. Mice were randomly subjected to receive mefloquine or chloroquine thirty minutes in advance. The role of opioidergic/nitrergic systems was shown by co‑administration of pharmacological intervention and nitrite levels measurement in mice hippocampi. Results indicated that mefloquine (40 mg/kg) and chloroquine (5 mg/kg) significantly decreased the occurrence of tonic hindlimb extension. Also, mefloquine 120 mg/kg and chloroquine 5 mg/kg significantly increased seizure latency and decreased mortality rate. Mefloquine decreased seizure frequency too. Besides, mefloquine (20 mg/kg) and chloroquine (5, 10 mg/kg) significantly increased seizure threshold. Interestingly, L‑NAME, 7‑NI and naltrexone pre‑treatment reversed the anticonvulsant effects of both mefloquine (20 mg/kg) and chloroquine (5 mg/kg). Moreover, co‑administration of minimal‑effective doses of morphine with mefloquine/ chloroquine (both 1 mg/kg) potentiated anticonvulsant effects, which was reversed by naltrexone and endorsed the involvement of opioid receptors. Also, nitrite levels in mice hippocampi remarkably increased after treatment with both mefloquine (20 mg/kg) and chloroquine (5 mg/kg). To conclude, mefloquine could protect the central nervous system against seizures in PTZ/MES‑induced models through opioidergic/nitrergic pathways, with similarity to chloroquine effects.",

    "abstract": "Pituitary adenoma is a typical adult primary brain tumor and 35% of pituitary adenomas are invasive. The enhancement of angiogenesis is essential for the spread and invasiveness of invasive pituitary adenoma. Thus, it is urgent to uncover the mechanism and relevant biomolecular targets for the therapy and prognosis of pituitary adenomas. The HP75 cells were transfected with si‑NC, si‑TFF3, pcDNA, and pcDNA‑TFF3 to investigate the effects of TFF3 on the proliferation, migration and invasion of pituitary tumor cell. The protein level of TFF3 and HIF‑1α/VEGFA was determined by western blot. The transwell migration assay and wound healing assay were used to investigate the influence of TFF3 on the cell migration and invasion of HP75 cells. The tumor angiogenesis was determined by tube formation assay. The proliferation of HP75 cells was assessed by using MTT assay and colony‑forming unit assay. The cell proliferation rate was separately enhanced and reduced remarkably in TFF3 overexpression group and si‑TFF3 group. TFF3 could modulate the proliferation, migration and invasion ability of HP75 cells. Furthermore, TFF3 may play a oncogenic role in HP75 cells. Overexpression of TFF3 enhanced the number of branching points and network formation in HP75 cells, suggesting the TFF3 had positive effects on cell angiogenesis. These results also disclosed a novel relationship between TFF3 expression and the activation of the HIF‑1α/VEGFA signaling pathway. In summary, this study uncovered new insight into the mechanisms of TFF3's anti‑tumor activities in pituitary adenoma cells by investigating its effects on HIF‑1α/VEGFA signaling pathway regulation.",

    "abstract": "Ischemic stroke is a severe threat to the health of older individuals. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) have been implicated in ischemic stroke. Urokinase‑type plasminogen activator (uPA) and its specific receptor (uPAR) are associated with the pathological process of ischemic stroke. However, the relationship between BMSCs and uPA/uPAR in ischemic stroke remains unclear. For simulating the occurrence of an ischemic stroke in vitro, human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) were subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation followed by re‑oxygenation (OGD/R) and were then cocultured with BMSCs. 3,4,5‑dimethylthiazol‑2,5‑diphenyltetrazolium bromide and bromodeoxyuridine staining were used for measuring cell viability and proliferation. Flow cytometry was performed for assessing cell apoptosis. Endothelial cell tube formation was determined using angiogenesis assays. Alterations in the protein and gene expression in HBMECs were evaluated using western blot analysis and quantitative reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction, respectively. OGD/R considerably inhibited the viability and proliferation of HBMECs by inducing apoptosis, which was reversed by BMSCs. Consistently, OGD/R‑induced inhibition of angiogenesis was attenuated by BMSCs. In addition, BMSCs could protect HBMECs against OGD/R‑induced injury by positively regulating the uPA/uPAR/stromal cell‑derived factor‑1α (SDF‑1α)/C‑X‑C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) pathway, and uPA/uPAR could mediate the SDF‑1α/CXCR4 pathway in OGD/R‑treated HBMECs. Therefore, this study provides novel strategies to investigate the specific role of BMSCs in ameliorating OGD/R‑induced vascular endothelial cell injury.",

The role of IVX in anesthetic‑induced nerve injury is rarely reported and the mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we found that IVX improved the cognitive dysfunction induced by sevoflurane in rats. It inhibited sevoflurane‑induced cell apoptosis. In addition, IVX increased sevoflurane‑induced autophagy in rat brain. Mechanically, IVX activated the PGC‑1α/FNDC5 pathway in rat brain, and depletion of FNDC5 could inhibit the neuroprotective function of IVX.

    "abstract": "Memory and cognitive impairment induced by oxidative stress are among the main hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease's (AD) pathology. The present study aimed to investigate the potential neuroprotective effects of Thymus daenensis (T. daenensis) extract against scopolamine‑induced memory impairment and oxidative stress in rats. T. daenensis, widely distributed in Iran and Europe, is known to be a rich source of natural antioxidants and has been traditionally used for various medical purposes. The present study investigated the post‑treatment effects of T. daenensis on learning and memory functions, antioxidant cellular defense, and oxidative stress using the scopolamine rat model of AD. The experiments were performed by intraperitoneal injection of scopolamine for 10 consecutive days in Wistar male rats (180-220 g). Additionally, the animals received T. daenensis extract (50‑200 mg/kg) by gavage for 14 consecutive days after induction of memory impairment. The animals were divided into 8 groups, namely: control, 200 mg/kg of T. daenensis extract (D200), donepezil (DON), scopolamine (ALZ), ALZ animals treated with different doses of the extract (ALZ+D50 or 100 or 200 mg/kg) and ALZ animals treated with (ALZ+DON). The animals were then subjected to the Morris water maze (MWM) paradigm as a standard criterion for memory function assessment, and after extracting the brain tissues, the related biochemical oxidative stress parameters were determined in the brain. Our results indicated that T. daenensis extract significantly improved animals' performance in the MWM while significantly reducing oxidative stress and antioxidant imbalance. Furthermore, the extract did not show hepatotoxic effects on treated animals. In addition, the extract treatment significantly decreased both cellular malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PCO) content while conversely increasing the total reduced glutathione (GSH) content and also the levels of total and endogenous antioxidants in the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay. It seems that the administration of T. daenensis significantly improved both cellular biochemical aspects and memory performance in animal models. Conclusively, it could be beneficial for scopolamine‑induced neurotoxicity.",

Neural stem cells (NSCs) are multipotent progenitor cells that can differentiate into neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes under certain conditions. In our recent report, using an antibody that can recognize both BMP-2 and BMP-4 (BMP-2/4), we showed that BMP-2/4 is only expressed in astrocytes differentiated from NSCs in a medium containing 1 percent fetal bovine serum (FBS). In this in vitro model, the astrocytic differentiation of NSCs was mainly toward type-2. When NSCs were cultured in a medium containing 10 percent FBS, most of the cells differentiated into type-1 astrocytes. However, little information is available for BMP-2 and BMP-4 expression in type-1 and type-2 astrocytes induced from NSCs under these different culture conditions. In this study, using two antibodies specific for BMP-2 and BMP-4, respectively, we discriminated the presence of BMP-2 and BMP-4 in NSCs and their derivatives under 1 percent and 10 percent FBS culture conditions by RT-PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence staining. We found that BMP-2 and BMP-4 are highly expressed in both type-1 and type-2 astrocytes, and no detectable expression in NSCs, neurons and oligodendrocytes. This suggests that the astrocytes might be one source of BMPs during the differentiation of NSCs. However, in our model, we cannot exclude the possibility that microglia or endothelial cells could also be a source of BMPs.",

Decynium‑22 (D22) inhibits an alternative neurotransmitter removal pathway, namely uptake‑2.

This study was done to assess the effect of uptake‑2 inhibition on morphine‑induced conditioned place preference (CPP) and analgesia. In this study, the effects of morphine and/or D22 on CPP were evaluated following intraperitoneal injection in mice. Afterward, changes in motor activity were evaluated by the open field test. Using the tail‑flick model, the effects of D22 and/or morphine were evaluated on the pain threshold. The results showed that 20 mg/kg of morphine induced a place preference response. D22, at the dose of 0.03 mg/kg, caused place avoidance, while at the dose of 0.3 mg/kg, it produced a notable place preference response. Co‑administration of D22 and morphine showed that morphine reversed the CPP aversion induced by D22 at the lowest dose. Motor activity did not alter. In the tail‑flick test, morphine, at the dose of 3 mg/kg but not 1 mg/kg, increased the pain threshold. D22 induced significant analgesic responses. Co‑administration of D22 and morphine caused considerable analgesic effects. The findings revealed that D22 induced both conditioned aversion and preference depending on the dose while morphine induced CPP. Both drugs produced analgesia.",

Neurogranin (NRGN) is a postsynaptic protein secreted by excitatory neurons, and synaptic dysfunction can alter extracellular NRGN levels. In this study, we examined NRGN levels in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after experimental DAI in terms of their diagnostic value. Experimental DAI was induced using the Marmarou technique in male Wistar albino rats. Serum and CSF NRGN levels of the sham group, one‑hour, six‑hour, 24‑hour, and 72‑hour post‑DAI groups were measured by ELISA method. DAI was verified by staining with hematoxylin‑eosin and β‑amyloid precursor protein in the rat brain samples. While no histopathological and immunohistochemical changes were observed in the early hours of the post‑DAI groups, the staining of the β‑APP visibly increased over time, with positivity being most frequent and intense in the 72‑hour group. It was found that serum NRGN levels were significantly lower in the 6‑hour group than in the sham group. The serum NRGN levels in the 24‑hour group were significantly higher than those in the sham group. This study showed a dichotomy of post‑DAI serum NRGN levels in consecutive time periods. NRGN levels in CSF were higher in the one‑hour group than in the sham group and returned to baseline by 72 hours, although not significantly. Our study provides an impression of serum and CSF NRGN levels in a rat DAI model in consecutive time periods. Further studies are needed to understand the diagnostic value of NRGN.",

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the neural components, which underlie the CMCs in pitch‑size and spatial pitch‑elevation. This study focuses on answering the question of whether or not different CMCs are driven by similar neural mechanisms. The comparison of congruent against incongruent trials allows the estimation of CMC effects across different CMCs. The analysis of the measured neural activity in different CMCs strongly pointed toward different mechanisms which are involved in the processing of pitch‑size and pitch‑elevation correspondences. Differential, whole brain effects were observed within the superior parietal lobule (SPL), cerebellum and Heschls' gyrus (HG). Further, the angular gyrus (AnG), the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) were engaged in processing the CMCs but showed different effects for processing congruent compared to incongruent stimulus presentations. Within pitch‑size significant effects in the AnG and ACC were found for congruent stimulus presentations whereas for pitch‑elevation, significant effects in the ACC and IPS were found for incongruent stimulus presentations. In summary, the present results indicated differential neural processing in different simple audio‑visual CMCs.",

    "abstract": "Some evidence indicates that lower back muscles located at the non‑dominant side of the body are more fatigue resistant than their opposite counterparts presumably due to preferential use of the dominant hand. The aim of the study was to determine if any distinction exists in the surface electromyographic activity of corresponding contralateral non‑fatigued lumbar multifidus (LM) muscles as a function of hand dominance. The relative to maximum root mean square, the median frequency (MdF) and spike shape parameters were computed from the surface myoelectric signals of ipsilateral and contralateral lumbar multifidus muscle of 46 adult healthy subjects (27 right‑handed, 19 left‑handed) during voluntary contractions evoked by the single arm lifts in prone position. Activation of LM as a contralateral muscle to lifted arm was greater than as ipsilateral muscle, independently of handedness. Regardless if LM performed ipsi‑ or contralateral action to the lifted arm, the mean spike amplitude, slope, number of peaks per spike and spike duration were greater and mean spike frequency as well as MdF were smaller in the muscle of dominant than non‑dominant side. Combined changes of spike shape measures indicate increased recruitment, lower firing rates and higher synchronization of motor units in the LM of dominant side as compared to its counterpart.",

This study seeks to investigate the involvement of the miR‑155‑5p/BDNF axis in SD mice, aiming to establish a theoretical foundation for potential treatment strategies. Male C57BL/6 mice were utilized in the construction of a SD model using the flower pot technique. HT22 cells were selected for cellular experiments. The Morris water maze was employed to assess the learning and memory capabilities of the mice. HE staining was utilized to observe pathological changes in hippocampal tissue. Levels of IL‑1β, IL‑6, and TNF‑α were analyzed using ELISA. The expression level of miR‑155‑5p was quantified via RT‑qPCR. The binding between miR‑155‑5p and brain‑derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was confirmed through a dual‑luciferase reporter assay. Apoptosis of hippocampal neurons was assessed using TUNEL. Western blot analysis was conducted to evaluate the expression levels of BDNF, p65, and p‑p65. The Morris water maze test revealed that the mice exhibited prolonged escape latency, decreased swimming velocity, and reduced time spent in the target platform quadrant, which are indicative of a successful construction of the SD model. The observed cognitive deficits in the mice were associated with SD‑induced damage to the hippocampal tissue, leading to increased levels of miR‑155‑5p and decreased levels of BDNF. miR‑155‑5p was found to directly bind to BDNF, thereby suppressing its mRNA and protein expression. The upregulation of BDNF effectively mitigated hippocampal damage by attenuating cell apoptosis and reducing inflammation levels in SD mice. Additionally, the BDNF/NF‑κB pathway was found to be suppressed in SD mice through the downregulation of miR‑155‑5p. Therefore, the silencing of miR‑155‑5p inhibited the activation of the NF‑κB pathway by upregulating BDNF, which improved long‑term memory and reduced neuronal damage in SD mice.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the functional interaction between the cannabinoid and serotonergic systems of the primary somatosensory region (S1) of the brain in epileptiform activity caused by penicillin. The ACEA (an agonist of CB1 receptor), AM‑251 (an antagonist of CB1 receptor), 8‑OH‑DPAT (an agonist of 5‑HT1A receptor) and WAY‑100635 (an antagonist of 5‑HT1A receptor) were administered into the S1 after the same site administration of penicillin in urethane‑anesthetized rats. Electrocorticographic recording was done for a 90‑min period. The spike waves number and amplitude were recorded in 15‑min intervals. Areas under the curve (AUC) of the above‑mentioned spike alterations was calculated in 90 min. Spike waves with frequency of 30/min and amplitude of 1.3 mV were appeared after penicillin microinjection. The ACEA (50 ng), 8‑OH‑DPAT (500 ng) and ACEA (10 ng) plus 8‑OH‑DPAT (100 ng) reduced epileptiform activity. The AM‑251 (50 ng) and WAY‑100365 (500 ng) prevented the reducing effects of ACEA (50 ng) and 8‑OH‑DPAT (500 ng). The AM‑251 alone increased spike waves frequency. The AUC results supported the effects of the above‑mentioned treatments. The results showed that activating CB1 and 5‑HT1A receptors in the S1 may reduce the epileptiform activity caused by penicillin. Therefore, alone and together activation of central CB1 and 5‑HT1A receptors might be considered in the management of epilepsy treatment.",

However, the effects of chronic and systemic vitexin in PTZ‑kindled rats remain unknown. The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of long‑term treatment with vitexin in the PTZ‑kindling model of epilepsy. Male Wistar rats received intraperitoneal injections of PTZ at a subconvulsive dose of 35 mg/kg every other day for 29 days. Either saline containing dimethyl sulfoxide - DMSO 1% (vehicle), diazepam (2 mg/kg; positive control) or vitexin (2.5 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally 30 min before each PTZ injection. The behavioral reactions were recorded by 30 min immediately after each PTZ injection. Furthermore, on the 31st day, that is, 48 h after the latter dose of PTZ, the animals were euthanized and renal and hepatic biochemical markers were evaluated in blood serum. Chronic treatment with either diazepam or vitexin attenuated the seizures provoked by PTZ injections. Neither diazepam nor vitexin caused changes in renal levels of creatinine and urea and in hepatic levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. Our findings suggest that chronic administration of vitexin attenuates the progression of PTZ‑induced kindling without causing side effects on kidneys and liver.",

    "abstract": "The phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) gene is a critical tumor suppressor that plays an essential role in the development and functionality of the central nervous system. Located on chromosome 10 in humans and chromosome 19 in mice, PTEN encodes a protein that regulates cellular processes such as division, proliferation, growth, and survival by antagonizing the PI3K‑Akt‑mTOR signaling pathway. In neurons, PTEN dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol‑3,4,5‑trisphosphate (PIP3) to PIP2, thereby modulating key signaling cascades involved in neurogenesis, neuronal migration, and synaptic plasticity. PTEN is crucial for embryonic neurogenesis, controlling the proliferation of neural progenitor cells and guiding the migration and proper lamination of neurons in cortical and hippocampal structures. It also regulates dendritic growth and axon guidance, ensuring correct neuronal connectivity. In postnatal neurogenesis, PTEN maintains the balance of stem cell proliferation and integration of new neurons into existing circuits, particularly in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Animal models with PTEN deletion or mutation exhibit significant structural and functional neuronal abnormalities, including enlarged soma and dendritic hypertrophy, increased synaptic density, and altered synaptic plasticity mechanisms such as long‑term potentiation and long‑term depression. These changes lead to deficits in learning and memory tasks, as well as impairments in social behaviors. PTEN mutations are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders like intellectual disability, epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorders accompanied by macrocephaly. Understanding PTEN's mechanisms offers valuable insights into its contributions to neurodevelopmental disorders and presents potential therapeutic targets for cognitive impairments and neurodegenerative diseases. Future research should focus on elucidating PTEN's functions in mature neurons and its influence on established neuronal networks, which may have significant implications for memory enhancement and behavioral modifications.",

    "abstract": "Reciprocal connections of amygdaloid nuclei with the temporal neocortex in the dog were investigated. Injections of fluorescent tracers and BDA into particular temporal areas were made in eleven dogs. The topographical arrangement of connections and variations in their density differentiate the temporal neocortex in the dog into a few regions. Among them, the cortex involving the anterior part of the ectosylvian gyrus did not send any amygdalopetal projection. The middle ectosylvian, dorsal zone of the posterior ectosylvian and the anterior part of the Sylvian gyrus were weakly connected with the amygdala. The cortical region involving the ventral zone of the posterior ectosylvian and composite posterior areas, as well as posterior Sylvian gyrus, was characterized by profuse connections with the amygdaloid complex. Cortico-amygdaloid connections originate in the wide cortical area of the auditory cortex of the middle and dorsal part of the posterior ectosylvian gyrus as well as in the auditory association cortex located in the ventral ectosylvian, composite posterior and posterior Sylvian gyri. The connections showed a dorso-ventral gradient of increasing density, in the direction of association fields. The most substantial projection taking rise from the ectosylvian posterior and posterior composite gyri terminated preferentially in the pericapsular sector of the lateral amygdaloid nucleus and, to a lesser degree, in its medial sector. Terminals of connections originating in the Sylvian gyrus occupied preferentially the intermediate part of the lateral nucleus, slightly more medially than that from the ectosylvian and posterior composite areas. Additionally, axonal terminals derived from the composite posterior and Sylvian posterior areas were observed in the basal parvocellular and magnocellular nuclei. Neocortical projections were reciprocated by amygdalofugal connections with two exceptions: the basal magnocellular nucleus was distinguished by a substantial amygdalofugal projection to the temporal neocortex focused on the dorsal Sylvian gyrus, and the central nucleus of the amygdala, in contrast, received an exclusively corticofugal projection.",

Samples of dialysate were analysed for changes in PgD2 concentration, in Ca2+e and in the level of NO. The results demonstrated that a 20-min pulse application of 0.1-2.5 mM NMDA via a micro dialysis probe induced a prolonged stimulation of PgD2 release that was sensitive to competitive NMDA receptor antagonists. An inhibitor of voltage-sensitive N/ channels, tetrodotoxin, did not influence this effect but significantly suppressed basal PgD2 production, whereas a NOS inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), prevented NMDA-evoked NO release and inhibited NMDA-induced PgD2 release in an L-arginine-sensitive manner. NO donors, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine and sodium nitroprusside, stimulated PgD2 release. NMDA-evoked decrease in Ca2+e was insensitive to TTX and L-NAME. These results demonstrate an in vivo NMDA receptor-mediated modulation of PgD2 synthesis in the brain, in which NO participates.",

For all fast motor units it was observed that after the first part of a tetanus at a lower frequency of stimulation the tension of the following part, of the better fused contraction, was depressed. This effect was called a tetanic depression. When the lower stimulation frequency was followed by the higher one, the depression was visible in some motor units only whereas in the remaining units a potentiation of the second part of the tetanus was visible. The tetanic depression was larger in fast resistant than in fast fatigable motor units. In slow motor units tetanic depression was not observed.

Injections of both peptides did not improve the performance in other performed tests including the open field test and the holeboard test. Therefore the results confirmed that AVP improves memory only in the passive avoidance test.

According to this hypothesis, the detection of an important stimulus produced the widespread inhibition of \"irrelevant\" networks, interrupting their ongoing activity and facilitating the analysis of selected information. In the present experiment, the responsiveness of visual cortex was evaluated during the P300 potential by using additional, probing stimuli. Large separation of the cortical visual fields permitted separate analysis of the input and more advanced stages of processing. Responses were recorded from Fz, Cz, Pz and Oz scalp sites. P300 waves were evoked by visual, mentally counted stimuli in a standard \"odd-ball\" procedure. Visual probes were delivered 200, 300, 400, 500, 700 and 1000 ms later. No responses to the probes were required. Significant suppression of responses to the probes delivered less than 400 ms after target stimuli was found in Oz and Pz but not in Cz or Fz . The suppression was not roportional to the voltage levels from which probe responses started. In Fz and Cz, latencies of probe responses were elongated if probes were delivered less than 400 ms after target stimuli. The results suggest that probe responses suppressed by the P300 potential in occipital and parietal cortex may be restored in frontal areas. In these areas the P300 potential could delay probe responses instead of suppressing them.",

The CuII-catalysed oxidation of C-terminal Met35 in βAP depends on the secondary structure of the peptide. That seems to be the key to the known propensities of this peptide to form reactive oxygen species and free radicals. The pro-oxidant character of βAP is not associated with its β-sheet insoluble form. On the contrary, the α-helically organised structure is responsible forβAP redox-related cytotoxicity.",

C6 and human glioblastoma multiforme cells derived from two patients were grown in an incubator. First, determined IC50 dose of L-glutamate (L-glu) was given for 24 hours and removed, and then respective MgSO4 or U-83836E doses were added to the culture medium. After 24 hours 3-(4,5-Dimethylthyazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, thiazolyl blue (MTT) test was applied. When compared to the L-glu-treated group, MgSO4 at the dose of 0.01 mM induced C6 and human glioma cell growth by 17%, 15% and 5%, respectively. At the dose of 1 microM U-83836E also increased C6 and human glioma cell growth by 12%, 13% and 5%, respectively. In conclusion, although MgSO4 and U-83836E do not strongly block glutamate-induced cell death, it is suggested that reduction of Mg2+ ions and free radical production may have a role in glutamate toxicity on glial cells.",

An epileptic focus was produced by injection of penicillin G potassium (500 units) into the somatomotor cortex.

The PPN neuronal circuitry related to theta generation involves its cholinergic, GABA-ergic and glutamatergic components. Here we provide data indicating that the PPN tachykinin system may also be a part of this circuitry. In the experimental model of the tail-pinch elicited hippocampal theta in urethane-anesthetized rats (implanted with bilateral recording electrodes in the stratum moleculare of the upper blade of the dentate gyrus and with injection cannula unilaterally inserted into the PPN) it was found that intra-PPN microinjection of Substance P (SP) and [d-Pro2, d-Phe7, d-Trp9]-Substance P (DPDPDT) caused suppression of the theta and enhancement of the delta activity in the hippocampal EEG. Accordingly, there was approximately a 50% (SP) -70% (DPDPDT) decline of the peak power in the theta frequency range and a decrease by 0.4 Hz in the corresponding peak frequency (DPDPDT only) in both hippocampi. The circuitry through which SP exerts its effect in the PPN can be only hypothetical at present. We suggest SP-evoked activation (either direct or indirect through the glutamatergic inputs) of the GABA interneurons which may tonically inhibit PPN outputs to the other theta-relevant structures.",

Electrophysiological experiments were based on stimulation of axons in the sciatic nerve and intracellular recording of antidromic action potentials from individual motoneurones located in L4–L5 segments of the spinal cord. The following parameters were analyzed after application of a single stimulus and a doublet: amplitude and duration of the antidromic spike, amplitude, total duration, time to minimum, half-decay time of the afterhyperpolarization (AHP). It was demonstrated that application of a pair of stimuli resulted in: (1) a prolongation of action potentials, (2) a prolongation of the total duration and half-decay time of the AHP, (3) a decline of the time to minimum of the AHP, (4) an increase of the AHP amplitude of the spike evoked by the second stimulus. Significant differences in AHP parameters were found either in fast or slow motoneurones. We suppose that doublet-evoked changes in the AHP amplitude and duration are linked to intrinsic properties of individual motoneurones and may lead to the prolongation of the time interval to subsequent motoneuronal discharges during voluntary activity.",

    "abstract": "Epileptic seizures are accompanied by learning and memory impairments. In this study, the effect of low frequency stimulation (LFS) on spatial learning and memory was assessed in kindled animals and followed for one month. Fully kindled rats received LFS at 4 times (immediately, 6 h, 24 h and 30 h following the final kindling stimulation). Applying LFS improved kindled animals' performance in the Barnes maze test. This LFS action was accompanied by a decrease in NR2B gene expression, an increase in the gene expression of the α subunit of calcineurin A and an increased NR2A/NR2B ratio in kindled animals. In addition, the gene expression of the GABAA receptor γ2 subunit increased at 2–3 h after applying LFS. The increase in NR2A/NR2B ratio was also observed 1 week after LFS. No significant changes were observed one month after LFS administration. Field potential recordings in the hippocampal CA1 area showed that kindling-induced potentiation of the field EPSP slope returned to near baseline when measured 2–3 h after applying LFS. Therefore, it may be postulated that applying LFS in kindled animals reduced the seizure-induced learning and memory impairments, albeit time-dependently. In tandem, LFS prevented kindling-induced alterations in gene expression of the described proteins, which are potentially important for synaptic transmission and/or potentiation. Moreover, a depotentiation-like phenomenon may be a possible mechanism underlying the LFS action.",

In the present study, we performed a systematic review to stress the neurobiological effects of forced swim exercise on the rodent hippocampus. Behavior, antioxidant levels, neurotrophins and inflammatory markers were the main topics examined upon the swimming effects. Better results among these analyses were associated with forced exercise at moderate intensity with an adaptation period and the opposite for continuous exhausting exercises with no adaptation. On further consideration, a standard swimming protocol is necessary to reduce variability of results for each scenario investigated about the impact of the forced swimming on the hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "Disaggregation of amyloid βeta (Aβ) is considered as one of the promising therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer’s disease. Polyphenols are promising molecules for the disaggregation of Aβ. However, in order to find a potential therapeutic candidate, the in vitro analyses need to be performed on a model that mimics the blood‑brain barrier (BBB) as much as possible. Therefore, we aimed to establish an in vitro BBB representative transwell system by using differentiated human neuroblastoma (SH‑SY5Y), cerebral microvascular endothelial, and astrocyte cells to investigate transition and Aβ disaggregation capacity of punicalagin (PU), ellagic acid (EA), epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), gastrodin, and their combinations on the established system. The efficiency of the established transwell systems was evaluated by measuring the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and paracellular permeability coefficients (Pe) values. The transition and Aβ disaggregation capacities of the polyphenols were evaluated in the established tri‑culture transwell system based on obtained TEER (50,07 Ω.cm2) and Pe (65x10‑6 cm/s) values. Our results revealed that all polyphenols can successfully pass across the BBB system\\r\\nand disaggregate Aβ. While Aβ disaggregation capacities of the polyphenols were in the range of 30.52–45.01%, the percentages of their combinations were higher (75% for EGCG‑PU (Com 1) and 64% for EGCG‑EA (Com 2)). Consequently, this study provides the first evidence that Com 1 and Com 2 are promising polyphenol combinations in terms of Aβ disaggregation. Besides, the developed tri‑culture transwell system, containing differentiated SH‑SY5Y cells, may provide a new tool that closely mimics the BBB for basic research and testing of candidate agents.",

Amygdalar AEPs were recorded in response to the CS. It was hypothesized that if a state of emotional arousal is a sufficient condition for the manifestation of the N150, its amplitude should be enhanced in the Paired and Unpaired conditions relative to the Control condition, which was indeed found. In addition, it was found that the N150 had a larger amplitude in the Paired than in the Unpaired condition. This suggests that an additional N150 increase is established when animals learn the CS-US association. The results are discussed in relation to literature on amygdala function.",

Prepulse inhibition of the ASR and its changes due to dizocilpine (MK-801) injection were studied in 180 mice. The animals used in this study were obtained from our colony of 54 generation, Swiss-Webster mice selectively bred for high and low magnitude of analgesia. Three month old male mice of the high analgesia (HA) and the low analgesia (LA) lines, in addition to randomly bred controls (C), were used in the experiment. Thirty minutes before the ASR session the mice were injected intraperitoneally with saline or with 0.15, 0.25, 0.5 mg/kg of dizocilpine maleate. Prepulses suppressed the acoustic startle response in all lines in a prepulse intensity-dependent manner, but only the differences between the weakest and the strongest prepulses appeared significant. Two-way ANCOVA performed separately for each line revealed a significant effect of dizocilpine and prepulse intensity. Only in the HA line, however, the disruption of PPI from the injection of dizocilpine was evidenced by significant treatment by prepulse interaction. That means the prepulses decreased ASR significantly less in dizocilpine- treated animals than in saline-treated animals. The results confirmed that the mouse lines manifesting differential ASR magnitudes along with different degrees of PPI sensitivity to dizocilpine, might be suitable for pharmacogenetic studies on the glutaminergic mechanism of the startle response.",

Previously we reported a delayed maturation of the peripheral visual field representation in primary visual area 17, based on a 2-D DIGE screen for protein expression changes and in situ hybridization for the activity reporter gene ZIF268. To corroborate these findings we here explore the binocular pattern deprivation (BD)-regulated expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a well-described neurotrophin precipitously regulated by early visual experience. To assess the timing of maturation-related BDNF expression we compared the central and the peripheral visual field representations of area 17 of 1, 2, 4 and 6-month-old and adult cats reared under normal visual conditions. To scrutinize the outcome of BD, four different deprivation strategies were compared, including early onset BD from birth and lasting for 2, 4 or 6 months (2BD, 4BD, 6BD), and late onset BD for 2 months upon 2 months of normal vision (2N2BD), as animal models of congenital and delayed onset cataract. During normal cortical development the BDNF transcript levels, measured by quantitative RT-PCR, remained stable. Higher BDNF mRNA levels were found in central area 17 of 2BD and 6BD animals compared to age-matched controls. In central area 17, the high BDNF mRNA levels at the end of the BD period may activate a mechanism by which plastic processes, halted by deprivation, may begin. We here confirm that the peripheral visual field representation of area 17 matures slower than its central counterpart. Only in central area 17 normal visual input upon BD could upregulate BDNF mRNA which may lead to a fast activation of local plastic adaptations.",

    "abstract": "Several studies in rats have shown activation of cortical regions and concurrent deactivation of the hippocampus during the retrieval of spatial memory, as the consolidation process progresses. To determine whether during this post-learning period of memory reorganization, spatial memories are transformed from a specific to a more generic representation, in Experiment 1 we compare remote spatial memory measured using a single probe trial versus relearning. Results show that spatial memory can be effectively retrieved using a single probe trial during the 18 days following learning; after this time a retraining procedure is necessary. In Experiment 2 and 3 we tested the effect of a reminder treatment on the retrieval of remote memory. Results indicate that when the reminder was applied after experimental day 18, the treatment did not significantly improve the retrieval of spatial memory during a retention test (Exp. 2); however, if the reminder was applied before day 18, a significant improvement during the retention test was observed (Exp. 3). In order to investigate the extent to which memory becomes more difficult to retrieve as time passes due specifically to a retrieval deficit, in experiment 4 no significant differences, but marginal ones, were detected between an overtrained group and a control group when the retention test took place 30 days after the end of learning. Overall, the present results suggest that as the consolidation process progresses, spatial information becomes more difficult to recover, in part because the original detailed trace has gradually been transformed into a more schematic representation.",

    "abstract": "The reasons for the rise in autism prevalence are a subject of heated professional debate. Featuring a critical appraisal of some research used to question whether rising levels of autism are related to environmental exposure to toxins (Soden et al. 2007, Barbaresi et al. 2009, Thompson et al. 2007) we aim to evaluate the actual state of scientific knowledge. In addition, we surveyed the empirical research on the topic of autism and heavy metal toxins. In our opinion empirical investigations are finding support for a link with heavy metal toxins. The various causes that have led to the increase in autism diagnosis are likely multi-faceted, and understanding the causes is one of the most important health topics today. We argue that scientific research does not support rejecting the link between the neurodevelopmental disorder of autism and toxic exposures.",

    "abstract": "The medical understanding of autism has changed since it was first defined by Kanner. Nowadays medicine identifies many medical abnormalities and diseases, which may underline or aggravate the cognitive aspect, behavioural issues and general health in autists. This includes chronic inflammation of gastrointestinal tract, dysbiosis, maldigestion, malabsorption, malnutrition, food intolerance, allergies, chronic viral, fungal and bacterial infections, impaired kidney function, impaired detoxification of endo- and exotoxins, disorders of metal ion transportation. Treatment of the above mentioned conditions combined with improving detoxification mechanisms, followed by a special diet and individually customized supplementation of nutritional deficiencies may lead to the improvement of the functioning of these patients, changing their level of functioning and self-dependence. The aim of this paper is to present medical problems of children with autism which may be identified and treated by general practitioners as a review of current medical papers related to Autism Spectrum Disorder, in the context of author's professional experience, based on the medical cases from author's practice.",

This is a significant progress to understand developmental neurobiology, in particularly the possibility of converting glia to stem cells for the treatment of neurological disorders. Similarly, recent findings revealed that brain-resident microglias (MGs) can be converted to multipotential state through de-differentiation. In this study, we investigated the role of SRY (sex-determining region)-box 2 (SOX2), a high-mobility group DNA binding domain transcription factor, in the reprogramming of OPCs and MGs and molecular pathways involved in these process. Immunocytochemical analyses demonstrated that expression of SOX2 was upregulated in the reprogrammed MGs and OPCs as well as other neural stem cell markers such as CD15 and nestin. Western blot and double immunostaining analyses further confirmed that activation of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) signaling partnering with SOX2 might be one of the molecular pathways involved in lineage reprogramming of OPCs which is also true in the reversion of MGs. Taken together, these results indicated that lineage reprogramming of OPCs and MGs are both controlled by the same signaling pathway and glia can be reprogrammed in culture by inducing expression of neurogenic transcription factors to transgress their lineage restriction and can stably acquire a neuronal identity. Our results suggested innovative perspectives for cell therapy with glia cells.",

    "abstract": "\"To behave more efficiently the human brain must anticipate future events with different probabilities and prepare appropriate responses. Previous studies demonstrated that participants react faster to more probable stimuli. It has been shown that this effect in reaction time reduction is related to the response preparation process. However it is still unknown what the minimum difference in stimulus probabilities is that is sufficient to elicit response preparation as measured with the EEG. Intra-individual reaction time variability indicates the stability of an individual’s response performance and provides useful information about cognitive functioning. It’s use has become prevalent in recent clinical studies. In order to extend understanding of cognitive and neural mechanisms of response stability we hypothesized that intra-individual reaction time variability relates to the response preparation process. Specifically, we hypothesized that response preparation to more probable stimuli would result in not only faster reaction time but also in a reduction of response variability. To verify this hypothesis, we tested 14 healthy subjects using reaction time and EEG as dependent measures. Two different stimuli with probabilities of 33.3% and 66.6% were assigned to two counterbalanced responses. The results of our study showed that stimulus probabilities of 66.6% and 33.3% were sufficient to elicit response preparation. Our data also revealed that response preparation to more probable stimuli speeds RT and reduces RT variability.\"",

    "abstract": "Proinflammatory cytokine – interleukin 1β (IL-1β) plays an important role in stress reactions in the structures of limbic system. The impact of stress on IL-1β may depend on the ontogenetic age. The study examined the influence of acute and chronic exposure to forced swim (FS) or high-light open-field (HL-OF) stressors on neurons containing IL-1β. Double immunofluorescence staining was used to reveal the density of IL-1β/NeuN (NeuN – a neuronal nuclear marker) – immunoreactive (ir) cells in the amygdaloid central (CeA) and medial (MeA) nuclei, which are closely involved in the regulation of emotional stressors and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) activation. Adult (P90; P – postnatal day), middle-aged (P360), and aged (P720) male Wistar Han rats were used in these experiments. We observed an age-dependent increase in the basal density of IL-1β/NeuN-ir cells in CeA and MeA in P90 vs. P360 and P360 vs. P720 rats. Neither acute nor chronic FS caused significant changes in the density of IL-1β-ir neurons in any of the investigated nuclei in P90, P360, and P720 rats as compared with the non-stressed groups. However, chronic but not acute HL-OF caused a marked increase in the density of IL-1β/NeuN-ir cells in the CeA and MeA of P360 rats and in MeA of the P720 animals. Moreover, chronic HL-OF led to an increase in the density of IL-1β-ir neurons in relation to acute HL-OF in the CeA and MeA of both P360 and P720 rats. Our results may indicate the involvement of IL-1β neurons in the development of ageing processes in CeA and MeA. Furthermore, our results point out that chronic HL-OF is an aggravating factor that induces an increase in the density of IL-1β/NeuN-ir cells in the MeA and/or CeA of middle-aged and aged rats. The increase is possibly due to insufficient control of the HPA axis associated with involutional ageing processes and seems to be a common denominator of the ageing process and stress.",

An increase of grating length enhanced N1 amplitude at occipital and parietal positions stronger than the increase of grating width at aspect ratios (length : width) above 4:1. The stronger effect of stimulus length than width was reflected also in the amplitude of the later P1 component at central and parietal positions. The larger effect of stimulus length than width on the VEP amplitude was SF specific: it was stronger at 5.8 c/deg, smaller at 2.9 c/deg and vanished at 1.45 c/deg.

However recent studies have shown that the frequency of MFN2 gene mutations in HMSN II patients is surprisingly low. To date, no systematic studies devoted to HMSN IIa in Poland have been carried out. In this study, we searched for MFN2 gene mutations in Polish patients representing the population of nearly 40 million. We decided to include a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes in the study, proving able to detect, in a group of 67 affected patients: 1) 3 pathogenic mutations; 2) 3 sequence variants of unknown pathogenic status; 3) 9 rare MFN2 gene sequence variants; 4) 6 common polymorphisms. The frequency of MFN2 gene mutations in the whole group of patients is 4.5%. Due to the high frequency of MFN2 gene sequence variants within single patients we could not definitely exclude the cumulative effect of these contributing to the HMSN II phenotype. The MFN2 gene should therefore be considered in Polish HMSN II patients, though it is still not possible to determine its position in HMSN II molecular diagnostics.",

The results indicate the presence of late internal noise and show that the internal noise and sampling efficiency strongly depend on the elongation, duration and line length of the patterns.

While it is well known that the permeability surface area product of the BBB to a LNAA from blood to brain (PS1) can be calculated from the arterial LNAA concentrations and kinetic constants of the BBB, we demonstrate that the permeability surface area product from brain to blood (PS2) can be calculated by deriving the substrate activity of the saturable transporter from the kinetic constants and arterial and jugular venous LNAA concentrations, and that the concentration of the LNAA in brain extracellular fluid can then be determined. This approach is methodically simple, and may be useful for assessing the transcerebral exchange kinetics of LNAAs in future human-experimental and clinical studies.",

C57Bl/6 strain, wild‑type (WT) and BDNF heterozygous (+/‑) mice were used to reveal the effects of endogenous BDNF concentrations. We compared diet and genotype effects using four experimental groups: WT and BDNF heterozygous (+/‑) groups of mice were each fed a normal or high‑cholesterol diet for 16 weeks. The cylinder test and wire hanging test were performed to evaluate neuromuscular deficits and cortical sensory‑motor functions, respectively. In addition, neuroinflammation was assessed by tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 6 levels measured in the somatosensory and motor areas. Additionally, MDA levels and SOD and CAT activity were evaluated as oxidative stress parameters. Results showed that a high‑cholesterol diet significantly impaired behavioral performance in the BDNF (+/‑) group. Diet did not change the levels of neuroinflammatory markers in any of the groups. However, MDA levels, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were significantly higher in the high‑cholesterol‑fed BDNF (+/‑) mice.

Patients were given milnacipran in the doses of 50‑100 mg once daily. Patients were followed up for 12 weeks. HAM‑D score at the start of treatment was 17.8±1.7 which significantly reduced to 8.9±3.1 at 12 weeks of treatment. In responders, the plasma BDNF levels increased significantly at 12 weeks post treatment. There was no significant change in the pre‑ and post‑treatment values of oxidative stress parameters (MDA, GST and GR) after 12 week treatment. Milnacipran is effective and well tolerated in MDD patients, and its therapeutic response is associated with an increase in plasma BDNF levels. However, milnacipran did not affect oxidative stress biomarkers.",

The administration of morphine and cannabis in rats has been shown to decrease thyroid weight and thyroid‑stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. We hypothesized that the third ventricle, due to its adjacency to the hypothalamus, is involved in the modulation of hypothalamic‑pituitary‑thyroid axis activity and descending pain pathways. The present study examined the effect of intra‑third ventricle administration of morphine and cannabis agents on the modulation of pain behavior in normal, hypothyroid (increased serum TSH), and hyperthyroid (decreased serum TSH) rats using the tail‑flick test. The results indicated that intra‑third ventricle injection of AM251 (CB1 receptor antagonist) caused hyperalgesia, while intra‑third ventricle administration of ACPA (CB1 receptor agonist) and morphine produced analgesia in normal, hypothyroid, and hyperthyroid rats. A non‑effective dose of morphine (0.5 μg/rat) did not attenuate hyperalgesia induced by an effective dose of AM251. Co‑injection of ACPA and morphine into the third ventricle induced anti‑nociceptive effect in normal, hypothyroid, and hyperthyroid rats. An isobolographic analysis demonstrated a synergistic effect between ACPA and morphine in the production of the anti‑nociceptive effect. Consequently, the third ventricle may modulate pain behavior induced by cannabinoid and opioid receptors via descending pain pathways in normal, hypothyroid, and hyperthyroid rats.",

Despite years of research, it is still not known how it contributes to dementia development. APOE has been implicated in many AD pathology mechanisms, like Aβ clearance, brain metabolism, changes within microglia and other glial functions and inflammatory processes. In fact, immunological/inflammatory processes are recently discussed as an important factor in Alzheimer's development and granulocyte profiles changes are reported in patients. However, the exact link between the immune system and risk‑genes is unknown. In particular, it is not known whether and how they interact throughout the lifetime, before the disease onset. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between granulocyte count and the APOE/PICALM genes in healthy individuals with an increased genetic risk of AD. An exploratory analysis regarding other blood cells was also conducted. Blood samples were collected from 77 healthy middle‑aged (50-63 years old) participants, who were also asked to complete a health and life‑style questionnaires. Groups with different AD risk‑genes were compared. Differences in granulocyte profiles were found in healthy carriers of AD risk‑genes who had slightly elevated eosinophil levels as compared to non-risk carriers. An exploratory analysis showed some alteration in mean corpuscular hemoglobin content and concentration (MCH/MCHC) levels between risk‑carriers subgroups and non-risk carriers. No other differences in blood count or lipoprotein profile were found between healthy APOE/PICALM risk‑carriers and non-risk carriers. Longitudinal studies will reveal if and how those changes contribute to the development of AD pathology.",

Post‑stroke aphasia (PSA) and primary progressive aphasia (PPA) are syndromes that, despite having common features, differ in the brain mechanisms that cause their symptoms. These differences in the underlying functional neuroanatomical changes may influence the way they are addressed by different non‑invasive brain stimulation techniques and, in particular, by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the efficacy of rTMS in the treatment of PSA and PPA, as well as the differences in the approach to these disorders using rTMS. To this end, a total of 36 articles were found in the Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. The results obtained suggest that whereas in PSA, the selection of the stimulation paradigm is based on bi‑hemispheric functional reorganisation models with a tendency towards the application of inhibitory rTMS in the contralateral right hemisphere, in PPA, the application of excitatory rTMS in functionally compromised areas seems to show promising changes. It is concluded that rTMS is a potential treatment in the therapy of both disorders, although differences in the underlying brain mechanisms differentiate the rTMS approach in each case.",

Next, western blotting was utilized to examine the protein expressions of microtubule‑associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), p62, hypoxia‑inducible factor 1‑alpha (HIF‑1α) and Bcl‑2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa‑interacting protein 3 (BNIP3). Relative to RI group, IL‑4 group had a significantly lower neurological impairment scale (NIS) score and an overtly lower apoptosis rate of neurons as well as a strikingly smaller cerebral infarction volume and number of autophagosomes (P<0.05). The LC3II/LC3I ratio and HIF‑1α and BNIP3 protein expressions dropped, but p62 protein expression rose pronouncedly in IL‑4 group (P<0.05). In contrast to those in RI group, the NIS score, neuronal apoptosis rate, cerebral infarction volume and autophagosome number were strikingly reduced (P<0.05). The NIS score, cerebral infarction volume, neuronal apoptosis rate, autophagosome number, LC3II/LC3I ratio and protein expressions of HIF‑1α and BNIP3 plummeted, while p62 protein expression sharply rose in IL‑4 + 2ME2 group relative to those in IL‑4 group (P<0.05). IL‑4 suppresses cell autophagy by inhibiting the HIF‑1α/BNIP3 pathway, thus relieving CIRI in rats.",

A single i.p. injection of Pc at doses of 1,000,000, 1,500,000 or 2,000,000 IU/kg resulted in a transient increase in SWD activity. For the latter two doses, Pc injections also induced convulsive activity, i.e. single spikes and trains of spikes accompanied by myoclonies. When 1,500,000 IU/kg of Pc was administered repeatedly (six injections, one every 48 h), the amount of the convulsive activity induced by successive injections decreased but the increase in the number of SWD bursts became more pronounced.

The completeness of the blockade of NTS region was checked by studying the Hering-Breuer reflex. MNR was stimulated at the level 2-7 mm rostral to the obex. Stimulation at the rostral part of this region produced inhibition of phasic inspiratory activity, whereas stimulation in the caudal part elicited tonic activity throughout the respiratory cycle. These effects were more pronounced on EI than Phr.

Seven patients with unilateral stereotaxic damage to the anterior part of hippocampus and unilateral or bilateral damage to the medial part of amygdala and 11 control subjects with no brain damage participated in the research. They were presented with memory tests that required either remembering a spatial arrangement of simultaneously presented verbal vs nonverbal stimuli or a temporal order of sequentially presented items. Moreover, a sensory information storage test was used. The results indicate that even small damage limited to the anterior part of the hippocampus and medial part of the amygdala results in a mild memory deficit. Memory impairment was not related to the side of hippocampal lesion. This suggests that memory function subserved by the hippocampus is not lateralized. Differential effects of left and right lobectomies found in previous studies were, thus, probably due to the damage to temporal cortex. The results showed, however, that sensory information storage limited to 3 s is not impaired after focal damage to the hippocampus and amygdala. A clear lateralization effect showing right hemisphere advantage in that function was found.",

The threshold was noted while the muscle was relaxed and during weak voluntary contraction. The application of the double-cone coil allowed us to obtain for foot muscles similar threshold values as for hand muscles with a circular coil.

    "abstract": "Ischemic neuronal injury is supposed to be caused in part by the extracellular accumulation of excitatory amino acids (EAA). Neurotransmitter and metabolic EAA can be released from synaptic vesicles and cytoplasm of neurones and glial cells. In this study the release of the glutamate analogue [3H]D-aspartate ([3H]D-ASP), loaded into 500 microns slices of rat hippocampus, was investigated. The efflux of the label was measured during anoxic-aglycemic (\"ischemic\") and normoxic K+ depolarization. To identify the pools from which [3H]D-ASP is released we have estimated its calcium dependence and the effects of inhibitors of: (1) Na(+)-dependent transporter of amino acids (100 microM L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid/L-trans-PDC/), (2) sodium channel (1 microM tetrodotoxin TTX), and (3) anion channel (1 mM furosemide). [3H]D-ASP released upon normoxic depolarization was 40% inhibited by TTX, nearly 40% by L-trans-PDC and over 50% by furosemide. The \"ischemic\" release was in 40% calcium dependent, completely TTX independent and in approximately 50% blocked by furosemide treatment. Our data suggest that EAA accumulated in the synaptic cleft during ischemia are mainly released from the cytosolic compartment by mechanisms which are connected with the ischemic increase of extracellular potassium concentration.",

The concentrations of reduced glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were determined in the dorsal hippocampus in order to evaluate their changes during ischemia and reperfusion following ischemia. The depletion of GSH was observed during ischemia with a further depletion during post-ischemic reperfusion (P < 0.001), while a significant increase in SOD activity and MDA levels was found only after reperfusion following ischemia (P < 0.001). Animals in which ischemia was followed by reperfusion were treated with a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801 (1 mg/kg, i.v.), and a radical scavenger, U-83836E (5 mg/kg, i.v.), prior to ischemia. Although a full recovery of GSH levels was not observed following MK-801 and U-83836E pretreatment as compared to control (P < 0.05), MK-801 was more potent than U-83836E in the partial protection of the GSH pool (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). The rise in SOD activity and MDA level were brought close to those of control due to the effects of both MK-801 and U-83836E (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the tissue changes in GSH concentrations evoked by ischemia and reperfusion were partially prevented by the effects of both drugs, MK-801 having the greater effect. This suggests that the NMDA receptor activation may play a role in the generation of reactive oxygen species. On the other hand, the inhibition of lipid peroxidation brought about by both MK-801 or U-83836E suggests the therapeutic efficiency of these agents in ischemia/reperfusion injury.",

Using a linear summary measure as a control, we report a failure to reject the null hypothesis of a (largely) stationary linear-Gaussian process for normal, resting, eyes-closed EEG from a single participant. We found significant evidence of nonlinearity at two occipital sites (01 and 02) where the 8-12.5 Hz alpha rhythm was prominent. However, this element of nonlinear structure appeared trivial, as (1) we found no evidence of time irreversibility at these loci, and (2) best-fitting linear models accounted on-average for over 94% of the variance in the data with nonlinear modeling doing no better. Half of the remaining variance could be accounted for by nonstationarity. While our findings technically apply only to the one individual tested, his EEG was typical of those seen under the conditions that we employed.",

    "abstract": "Focal epilepsy may be induced acutely in the brain in vivo by measures which reduce inhibition or enhance excitation. Although the various models involve different mechanisms causing the epilepsy, their epileptiform discharge patterns vary only little. Intracellular analyses in vivo and in vitro reveal that the cellular hallmark of epileptic discharge, the paroxysmal depolarization shift, is followed by a giant hyperpolarization. The latter is comprised of several, overlapping, components with different durations, including calcium dependent potassium currents and GABA dependent inhibitions. Relative reduction of one inhibitory component is compensated by other inhibitory components. In epilepsy caused by reduction of GABAergic inhibition, the absolute duration and amplitude of GABAergic inhibition may even be increased in comparison to the responses following afferent stimulation under control conditions since the excitatory drive of the paroxysmal discharges on the interneurons is strongly increased. In some interictal discharge patterns, the enhanced inhibitions within the focus determine the refractory periods of the focus. The latter is paced by neurons from the perifocal area which show a shorter inhibition associated with the interictal epileptic event. The discharge pattern of the focus may switch to other patterns, either spontaneously, or as entrained by external stimulation. Such changes are caused e.g. by progressive potassium accumulations in the extracellular space with critically small intervals of the epileptic events. It is concluded that the epileptiform discharge patterns reflect intrinsic properties of the brain, and do not very well reflect the mechanism of action of the epileptogenic model. The brain is thus equipped with inherent mechanisms which favor rhythmic epileptiform discharges under certain conditions.",

Immunostaining experiments using a polyclonal antibody against C-terminal domain of synapsin Ia/b (anti-SynI-C) showed an unusual pattern in the SI cortex compared to other regions of the neocortex. The staining delineated the cells located in barrel hollows. The immunoreactive product was located on the perikarya and proximal dendrites of gabaergic neurons found in layer IV and VI of the SI cortex. Other anti-synapsin antibodies did not reveal this pattern within the SI cortex, although in the hippocampus all antibodies examined produced a similar pattern of immunostaining. Deglycosylation of sections resulted in complete loss of immunodecoration on the cell perikarya. We suggest that the anti-SynI-C recognizes a saccharide surface epitope, possibly an element of perineuronal nets that is specific for the primary somatosensory cortex.",

The animals had to leave a refuge, explore the platform to find a hidden piece of food and carry it back to the refuge. Once the rats were proficient at performing the procedural aspects of the task, they were tested in two successive types of trials in which the food pellet was either always located in the central cup (food at center, trials) or placed in a randomly chosen cup (food at random, trials). Except in the first FAC trials, all groups displayed similar outward paths in FAC and FAR trials, showing that both types of trials involved equivalent path integration demand. Analysis of the homing accuracy showed that rats with entorhinal cortex or parietal cortex lesions exhibited inaccurate returns to the starting hole, suggesting that these two cortical areas are part of a neural network mediating path integration.",

    "abstract": "The noradrenergic system of the hypothalamic paraventricular nuclei (PVN) has been associated with feeding, but whether it controls feeding in a way that is relevant to energy balance is still unclear. Rats were maintained on a high energy, carbohydrate-rich diet (HC), or a low energy, carbohydrate-free, protein-rich diet (LP), until their daily energy intakes equalized. When injected with noradrenaline (NA) into the PVN, they ingested the same amounts of both diets so that the animals on the LP diet consumed only half the total energy of those on the HC diet. Continuous delivery of NA into the PVN via a microdialysis probe induced chewing on non-nutritive pieces of corks. The same chewing pattern could again be elicited by the subsequent NA deliveries. It is concluded that the nutritional value of a diet is irrelevant to the NA feeding response. The failure of NA administration to increase rat feeding in terms of energy intake, combined with its ability to stimulate chewing, suggests that the primary role of the NA system of the PVN may not be controlling the carbohydrate and energy intake, but rather gating behavioral responses that under appropriate circumstances may lead to ingestion.",

The analysis of current responses to rapid agonist applications provides the means to study the ligand-gated receptor gating but experimentally based estimation of neurotransmitter transient at central synapses was an important challenge during the last decade. Both theoretical as well as experimentally based approaches indicated that synaptic agonist transient is very brief, implying that the activation of postsynaptic receptors occurs in conditions of extreme non-equilibrium. Such a dynamic pattern of activation of postsynaptic receptors has a crucial impact not only on the kinetics of synaptic currents but also on their susceptibility to pharmacological modulation.",

Healthy young males stood in the sagittal plane on an unstable platform supported by a pair of springs with modifiable stiffness. The balance test also assessed different levels of vision and cognitive function. Linear and nonlinear metrics of standing, based on motion captured kinematic data, were assessed to analyze the stability of standing. Results showed that vision plays a significant role in maintaining balance in terms of linear metrics. Elimination of visual feedback changed the direction of body sway and increased standing instability. Placement of low stiffness springs led to unstable standing. The cognitive dual task, however, had no effect on the stability metrics and merely could be revealed in the simplest test condition. Standing on an unstable platform was closely related to visual feedback and decreasing the spring stiffness significantly reduced stability. The roles of cognitive involvement were subdued by increasing the postural difficulty in standing on an unstable platform.",

The main goal of this study was to measure differences in speech intelligibility between older and younger people and to establish how speech intelligibility in competitive noise differs between younger and older populations with similar hearing status. More than 400 persons were tested using the Czech Test of Sentence Intelligibility in Babble Noise and divided into younger (40-65 years) and older (66-85 years) age groups. Test performance was compared between age groups based on subgroups stratified by SRT values (speech reception threshold in word audiometry in silence). Results showed a significant correlation between older age and diminished sentence intelligibility in competitive noise. Evaluation using a nonparametric U‑test showed a statistical difference between the younger and older groups in sentence intelligibility, with a speech signal presented at 65 dB sound pressure level (SPL) and competitive babble noise also presented at 65 dB SPL. Increased difficulty in the use of hearing aids in older users is related, among other things, to a reduced ability to discriminate speech not only in silence but particularly in competitive variable noise due both to their aging auditory functions and to a diminished capacity to differentiate the time factors of sounds. It is probably connected with the diminished function of inhibitory neurons.",

These variables contributed to 28.2% (R²) of Wave I. In conclusion, there was a significant interaction between the autonomic control of HR and auditory processing in the right ear, suggesting that vagal tone interacts with the cochlear nerve.",

    "abstract": "In the brain, pH can be lowered in both healthy and disease states. Previously, we showed that moderate extracellular acidification (down to pHo 7.0), but not intracellular acidification, leads to mitochondrial depolarization in synaptosomes. This indicates that the plasma membranes of neuronal presynaptic endings have proton receptors that can induce mitochondrial dysfunction when activated. In the present paper we attempt to identify this hypothetical receptor. First, we have demonstrated that lowering pHo to 7.0 does not induce sodium influx as monitored by the fluorescent dye Sodium Green. This fact, in conjunction with the absence of calcium influx in the same conditions - demonstrated previously, excludes ion channels as possible receptors. However, we showed that acidification-induced mitochondrial depolarization is sensitive to thapsigargin - an inhibitor of calcium release from intracellular stores, U73122 - an inhibitor of phospholipase C, as well as Cu2+ and Zn2+, which can block the metabotropic proton receptor ovarian cancer G protein-coupled receptor 1 (OGR1). Furthermore, using fluorescent dye Fluo-3 we have demonstrated that moderate extracellular acidification induces a cytosolic calcium increase. Excess calcium was scavenged by mitochondria (monitored by fluorescent dye Rhod-2). Our results suggest that the metabotropic OGR1 is a hypothetical presynaptic receptor for low pH. Its activation leads to phospholipase C activation and calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum followed by accumulation in mitochondria, which likely causes a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential.",

The modulation of intrinsic growth factor expression, such as neurotrophins and their receptors, is a necessary step in achieving neural stem cells (NSCs) therapy. The statins have recently been reported to provide both anti‑inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. In the developing and mature nervous systems, neurotrophic factors are known to impact neuronal growth and survival. In this study, we investigated for a positive effect of lovastatin on the expression of neurotrophins in the neonatal rat hippocampus‑derived NSCs. NSCs were isolated and cultured up to passage three. To confirm cellular identity, immunocytochemical evaluation and flow cytometry analysis were performed using specific antibodies. To determine the optimum concentration of lovastatin, the MTT assay was used. Neurotrophin expression was evaluated using quantitative real‑time reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR). Flow cytometry results demonstrated that NSCs were positive for nestin, a marker for neural progenitor cells. An increase in cellular viability was observed with a 24 h exposure of lovastatin. Moreover, results showed an increase in mRNA expression for all neurotrophins compared to the control group. Taken together, the results of this study add to the growing body of literature on the neuroprotective effects of statins in neurological disorders. Lovastatin is a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.",

C-fos-containing cells were counted in each cerebellar cortical layer, and cell count was compared between zebrin II positive and zebrin II negative bands of the lobules of the vermis and cerebellar hemispheres. We found significant activation of granule cells and interneurons of the molecular layer in zebrin II positive bands. The Purkinje cells, in contrast, exhibited non-significant, scattered c-fos immunoreactivity across all bands. Fluctuation of synaptophysin expression in the mossy fibre rosettes of the granular layer was determined via light microscopic immunohistochemistry. We detected a transient, significant decrease in synaptophysin staining density following 4-aminopyridine seizures, which may indicate short-term synaptic depression. We also identified different timing of increased c-fos expression in the neurons of the cerebellar cortex in different cortical zones. In particular, the activation pattern of the interneurons of the molecular layer reflected the climbing fibre distribution, reflecting the zonal olivo-cortico-nuclear organization. Seizure-induced activation of the granule cells corresponded with the zebrin II positive zones. This observation raises the possibility that zebrin II positive compartments may be more susceptible to cerebellar convulsions.",

However, molecular aspects related to gene expression, mainly in the hippocampus, require more investigation. Thus, this study evaluated the early and late cognitive functions and hippocampal gene expression after STZ administration. Male Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups: STZ (injected bilaterally), control group for the early memory function evaluation (1 month after surgery = phase 1, same volume of vehicle), and the same treatment for the late memory function evaluation (4 months after surgery = phase 2). The animals were observed in the elevated plus maze to assess behaviors related to anxiety, risk‑assessment and fear‑related memories. The behavioral tests were followed by brain removal and hippocampal dissection for RNA extraction and qRT‑PCR to assess the expression levels of 4 Alzheimer's disease related genes: Mapt, Apoe, C3 and Ps‑1. Animals from both phases showed increased time percentage and number of entries into the open arms, indicating risk behavior associated with anxiety, and an increased time percentage in the center square for both exposures (re‑test) when compared to the control group, suggesting working memory impairment related to an aversive event. Statistical analyses indicated that the STZ group presented alterations in anxiety, memory and risk assessment responses. Additionally, one month after STZ administration, C3 gene assays revealed an increased expression. Therefore, current data indicate that neuroinflammatory events linked to the expression of pro inflammatory cytokines such as C3 are related to memory, anxiety and decision-making alterations.",

It is a debilitating disorder that damages a person's health. Initially it was considered as a variant of multiple sclerosis (MS). But, in 2004, a water channel protein associated antibody was found to be responsible for the disease. This helped in distinguishing the disease from multiple sclerosis. Multiple molecular mechanisms like complement dependent cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity etc. contribute to the disease. Certain environmental and genetic factors have been identified as risk factors of the disease. Initially, the disease was thought to affect only the optic nerves and the spinal cord. But certain regions of the brain have also been found to be attacked during the course of the disease. A small proportion of the patients have been found to be seronegative for the AQP4-IgG. Recently, the term neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder has been framed to include all the features of the disease. The disease remains incurable despite the availability of various treatment modalities.

The dorsal hippocampus contains serotonergic and noradrenergic neuron terminals, which are related to cognitive processes. It is currently unknown whether prenatal stress modifies serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA) content and their release in the hippocampus during cognitive performance. Therefore, we measured these variables in the dorsal hippocampus of prenatally stressed males during spatial learning and memory tests. Cognitive tests were performed in 3-month-old control and prenatally stressed male rats in the Morris Water Maze (MWM). After cognitive tests, the dorsal hippocampus was dissected to quantify 5-HT and NA content. In other males, 5-HT and NA release in the dorsal hippocampus was assessed by microdialysis, before and after cognitive tests. Prenatally stressed males showed longer latencies to reach the platform, compared to control animals. Hippocampal 5-HT content decreased during learning and memory tasks in both groups, while NA content was not modified in prenatally stressed males neither before, nor after learning and memory tests. 5-HT and NA release were significantly lower in prenatally stressed animals during spatial learning and memory tasks. Corticosterone response was greater in prenatally stressed animals compared to controls. These results show that cognitive disruption caused by prenatal stress is related to decreased 5-HT and NA release, and to higher adrenal axis response in prenatally stressed animals.",

    "abstract": "Galanin (Gal) - a neuropeptide present in the nervous system and peripheral tissues - may be involved in the regulation of hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system function. It was shown that centrally injected galanin inhibits osmotically stimulated vasopressin (VP) secretion into the blood and reduces VP mRNA level in the supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular (PVN) hypothalamic nuclei. The aim of the present study in vitro was to investigate the influence of Gal on vasopressin release from isolated rat hypothalamus (Hth), neurohypophysis (NH) or hypothalamo-neurohypophysial explants (Hth-NH). The effect of Gal on VP secretion was studied under conditions of direct osmotic (i.e., Na+-evoked) (series 1) as well as nonosmotic (i.e., K(+)-evoked) (series 2) stimulation. In series 3, vasopressin response to Gal was studied using the neural tissues obtained from animals drinking 2 percent NaCl solution for eight days (indirect osmotic stimulation). Gal in a concentration of 10(-10) M and 10(-8) M inhibited basal VP release from Hth, NH and Hth-NH explants isolated from euhydrated rats as well as from Hth-NH complex of osmotically challenged animals. When the neural tissues obtained from previously salt-loaded rats were incubated in K(+)-enriched medium the inhibitory effect of Gal was completely blocked. It may be concluded that the effect of Gal is depending on the current functional status of the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system.",

The majority of TH-immunopositive neurons and fibers were located in the VTA, SN, and only scarce population of small neurons expressing TH was present in the PAG. In the SN 80 percent of TH-expressing neurons had large cell bodies, and only a small fraction had small perikarya. In the PAG populations of large and medium sized neurons were equal and 20 percent of neurons had small perikarya. Much scarcer population of TH-immunoreactive neurons in the PAG consisted of large or small neurons in its dorsal part (PAGd) and almost exclusively small neurons in the ventral part (PAGv). Distribution of neurons expressing TH and their types in the opossum are similar to those in rodents. The majority of CR-immunolabeled neurons were found in the VTA. In its subdivision, the parabrachal pigmented nucleus (PBP) cells expressing CR were approximately 28 percent more numerous than cells expressing TH. In spite of that, only 42 percent of TH-expressing neurons coexpressed CR. The high degree of colocalization TH and CR was observed in the SN. We propose that a higher percentage of TH/CR colocalization, which is observed in the opossums SN, may give them the ability to adapt to changes in their motor functions.",

It was recently discovered in Konorski’s papers deposed in the Library of the Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology. In his critical review Konorski debates advantages and shortcomings of the physiological approach of Pavlov and purely behavioristic approaches advocated by Hull and Skinner. He supports close cooperation o behaviorists with neurophysiologists and neuroanatomists, with focus on the investigation of the neural mechanisms underlying behavior. Konorski’s ideas concerning the integration of the study of behavior and neurophysiology anticipated contemporary path of neuroscience. Indeed, his approach, which at that time appeared somewhat controversial, is universally accepted by contemporary neuroscientists. By contrast, physiological theories of higher mental functions formulated by Pavlov as well as deliberately anti-physiological approaches of Skinner and Hull have all but disappeared from serious scientific discourse. However, the same problems such as strongly promoted self-importance of some branches of neuroscience, the lack of inter-communication between different branches and resulting lack of integrating ideas appear to emerge anew in each new generation of scientists.

    "abstract": "Maternal deprivation (MD) leads to a variety of behavioral changes in rats which closely resemble the symptoms of schizophrenia in humans. With the aim to investigate the morphological changes which underlie the behavioral insults in this experimental paradigm we exposed 9-day-old Wistar rats to a 24 h MD. At the period of young adulthood rats were sacrificed for morphometric analysis and their brains were compared to the control group. Rats exposed to MD had a decrease in hippocampal volume (71 percent of the control value) as well as a decrease in the size of pyramidal (62 percent of the control) and granular (60 percent of the control) cell layers. Also, there was a decrease in the thickness of the prefrontal, retrosplenial and motor cortex compared to the control group. Analysis of the density of NeuN-immunolabeled neurons revealed a reduction in retrosplenial and prefrontal cortex (70 percent and 81 percent of the control, respectively), while there was no difference in the motor cortex. Western blot analysis confirmed a decrease in NeuN expression in the MD group compared to the control rat brain homogenates. The results of this study show that early stress in life has a long-term effect on the morphology of cognitive brain regions, most probably due to the loss of neurons during postnatal development and further contributes to our understanding of the effects of maternal separation on brain development.",

Brain sections were stained immunocytochemically to detect MMP-1 expression, and histologically to reveal the state of hippocampal neurons. Administration of beta-amyloid peptide induced a significant degeneration of cells in the dorsal hippocampus. This was demonstrated by a significant decrease in the total number of cells and by the appearance of acidophilic neurons of altered (often triangular) shape. Altered cells were most often found in the hippocampal field CA3, and in a smaller quantity in the CA1 field. MMP-1-like immunoreactivity was found in the same hippocampal areas, the staining being restricted to the cells of altered shape (staining of somata and primary neurites).

Innocuous stimuli presented in an irrelevant condition elicit a simple cardiac deceleration termed ECR1. The same stimuli presented in a relevant condition (such as results from requesting subjects to silently count the stimuli) elicit a complex biphasic response with a large secondary acceleration in heart rate. This difference is attributed to the additional effect of cognitive task performance, resulting in an addition response component, ECR2. This may be realised by subtraction of the two responses. We investigated the mechanisms involved by comparing cardiac response profiles from a neurologically-impaired group with those from a control group. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has been associated with a loss of synaptic connections in the frontal lobe. Twelve ALS clinically non-demented patients were age-matched with twelve neurological patients without pathological changes in the brain. Cardiac response profiles for ECR1 and ECR2 were examined as a function of group. ECR1 did not differ between the groups, but ECR2 was significantly impaired in the ALS patients. The results are discussed in terms of different brain regions associated with these two cardiac response components. ECR1 may be associated with automatic pre attentive stimulus registration involving, in the case of auditory stimuli, the auditory analyser and associated pathways, while ECR2 appears to be a correlate of controlled executive processing, involving the frontal cortex.",

The distribution of charge, however, was greater than reported for the latter region, and ranged between 0.68 to 1.63 microC across sites. Some subjects were implanted with two electrodes, one aimed at the MPFC, and the other at the CPu, ventral tegmental area, or lateral hypothalamus. Only animals with CPu placements showed transference of self-stimulation to the MPFC, suggesting that these two regions might form part of the same reward substrate, a view that has anatomical, electrophysiological and recently behavioral support.",

ERPs evoked by target and non-target stimuli recorded in the first session of the experiment were compared with those recorded at least 40 min later. The early waves and P200 components indicated the increased responsiveness during the initial sessions. Amplitudes of both components were significantly larger. Latencies of the early waves were also significantly shorter. The effects were present in responses to both target and non-target stimuli. In contrast, the latency of P300 wave was significantly elongated during the first recording. Grand-averaged curves indicated also a reduction of P300 amplitude, but when individual waves were analyzed, the effect did not reach the level of statistical significance.

The animals displayed species-specific fly away only during the initial trials of a session. Subsequently long-latency crossings develops, reflecting a resistance to enter the opposite compartment. A measure based on a comparison of escape latency distributions in the two halves of the 1st session discriminates between good and poor learners. Subgroups of good and poor learners differed in performance efficiency in all five training sessions. Good learners were able to overcome the resistance to enter the opposite compartment and recall the learned short-latency escape.",

In the present study we compared the effects of HE on dopamine release in striatal and frontal cerebral cortical slices and synaptosomes in the presence and absence of Ca2+. HE enhanced the KCl-stimulated 3H-dopamine release from striatal and frontal cortical synaptosomes in the presence of Ca2+ to the same extent as in slices prepared from the respective brain regions. In the absence of Ca2+ a slight reduction in dopamine release was observed in frontal cortical synaptosomes from HE rats when compared to control rats, while no effect of HE on the release was discernible in frontal cortical and striatal slices and striatal synaptosomes. We conclude that in both brain regions studied HE stimulates dopamine exocytosis triggered by Ca2+ influx without affecting the release mediated by means of plasma membrane transporters or exocytosis involving intraterminal Ca2+.",

All three peptides concentration-dependently stimulated cyclic AMP production in the tested brain regions of 2-3-weeks-old (young) ducks, with VIP showing at least one order of magnitude weaker activity than PACAP. This characteristics suggests the existence in the duck's brain of adenylyl cyclase-linked PAC1 receptors.

    "abstract": "Drug addiction is a complex brain disorder, characterized by the loss of control over drug seeking and drug taking behavior, and by the risk of relapse, even after a prolonged period of abstinence. This disorder may have its source in a disturbed balance of drive-related behaviors, which control appetitive reactions aimed at seeking contact with an addictive substance. The act of consumption becomes more and more attractive, and the behavior takes on compulsive character. We suppose that drug addiction may involve a change in the mechanism of satisfaction of drives and states of satiation as well. To understand how the motivational processes are changed with the development of dependence, one must consider the mechanism of drive satisfaction and satiation states that occur in relation to the consumatory reflex. When a given drive is satisfied a state of fulfilment occurs. This state may be a result of a so-called \"antidrive\" mechanism (Konorski 1967). While a drive activity is characterized by general activation and tension, the drive satisfaction state (\"antidrive\") is characterized by relaxation and relief. When a particular drive is satisfied, the operation of other drives become possible. Therefore, we postulate that dysfunction of drive satisfaction leads to the sustained activation related to the current drug-related drive, which blocks the operation of other drives. In effect, uncontrolled compulsive appetitive behavior is released, and the operation of other drives is restrained, thus forcing the organism to focus on drug-related drive. The reason for an \"antidrive\" dysfunction may be related to adaptive changes which develop during a contact with an addictive substance.",

The other ten subjects were kept individually (Group IN); one rat per mesh cage, in conditions of relatively impoverished sensory stimulation. In both groups the training of the conditioned emotional response (CER) was performed when animals were three months old. In contrast to IN subjects, the rats subjected to permanent social contacts and reared in the enriched environment (Group SO) revealed almost equally low instrumental response rates in trials with the conditioned stimulus (CS) paired with nociceptive foot-shock (US), and in periods when &#x0D; no CS and/or US were applied. The results suggested that early exposure to an enriched environment caused a later decrease of the animals’ capability to differentiate between the aversive CS and cues of the experimental context. This cognitive impairment was probably a secondary effect of fear generalized to the entire experimental situation.",

Subjects reacted as fast as possible or with a defined time delay (from 250 to 750 ms) to a tone switching off by pressing a response-key with the left index finger (controlled by the right hemisphere) or with the right one (left hemisphere). For short delays (requested response times below 350 ms) variability of responses was much larger then for longer delays (above 350 ms), especially for the right hand. Thus, precise temporal control on consciously mediated actions sets only in after a rather long delay (in some cases after half a second). Neuronal mechanisms underlying conscious temporal control of actions appear to be different for the two hemispheres.",

    "abstract": "The influence of in vivo melatonin administration on in vitro pituitary follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), growth hormone (GH) and prolactin secretion, as well as the possible influence of dopamine (DA) were evaluated in prepubertal (31-day-old), pubertal (33-day-old) and adult female rats at diestrus phase of the sexual cycle. The in vitro pituitary hormone secretions were evaluated at basal rate for the first hour of incubation only, in Krebs Ringer phosphate (KRP) (I1) and after a second hour of incubation with KRP (I2) or with KRP+DA (I2 plus DA). I1PRL secretion was significantly higher in 33-day-old control and melatonin treated (MEL) rats as compared to I2 periods. However, in 31-day-old rats I1 secretion was higher than in the I2 or I2+DA periods, in MEL rats. In vitro GH secretion was significantly higher at I1 than during I2 periods in the control 31- and 33-day-old groups, but not in MEL rats. The only significant effect of DA was the elevation of GH in prepubertal MEL rats. In vitro FSH release was increased by melatonin in 31- and 33-day-old female rats. No differences in PRL, GH and FSH secretion were found in adult rats. In conclusion, the results show that melatonin effects upon in vitro pituitary gland activity are reproductive-stage-dependent modifying the secretory capacity of the lactotrop, gonadotrop and somatotrop during prepubertal and pubertal ages but not in adult rats studied at a quiescent phase of the sexual cycle.",

We found an approximately five‑fold increase in annexin A3a (anxa3a) expression levels in stim2b knockout zebrafish. The present study investigated whether annexin A3 protein is involved in SOCE. We used Ca2+ imaging and electrophysiological recordings to determine the effect of annexin A2, A3, and A6 overexpression on SOCE and Orai-dependent Ca2+ currents (ICRAC) in cultured cells. Annexin A3 increased SOCE amplitude and potentiated Ca2+ ICRAC currents. These results suggest that annexin A3 is a positive modulator of SOCE.",

Wild-type (+/+) and homozygous weaver (wv/wv) mice used were the offspring of pregnant dams injected in several cases with tritiated thymidine on embryonic days 11-15. DA neurons were identified for their tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity. Data reveal that at P8, the frequency of both +/+ and wv/wv late-generated DA cells increases from rostral to caudal SNc. No apparent DA-cell loss was observed at P8 in the mutant genotype, irrespective of the AP level considered. However, throughout the AP, there was a significant reduction in the number of these neurons at any level in 90-day-old weavers. Comparison of P8 and P90 +/+ SNc suggests that cell death is not a major aspect in the developmental regulation of normal DA neurons, although numerical cell depletion in the postnatal development of weaver SNc probably results from the amplification of a basal cell-death process, which affected all the coronal levels studied.",

In our experiment, the effect of procaine injections into different parts of the RPO on the electrical activity of the hippocampus, as well as on tail pinch-elicited hippocampal theta rhythm was assessed in urethanized rats. Power spectral analysis was performed using a Fast Fourier Transform routine in 1-Hz and 3-Hz bands between 0.6 and 12 Hz frequency. We have found that unilateral procaine inactivation of neurons in the caudal part of the RPO blocked the sensory-elicited theta rhythm. The same injection into the rostral RPO either had no effect or evoked long-lasting episodes of theta rhythm without sensory stimulation.

    "abstract": "A number of neurological disorders such as epidural hematoma can cause compression of cerebral cortex. We here tested the hypothesis that sustained compression of primary somatosensory cortex may affect stellate neurons and thalamocortical afferent (TCA) fibers. A rat model with barrel cortex subjected to bead epidural compression was used. Golgi-Cox staining analyses showed the shrinkage of dendritic arbors and the stripping of dendritic spines of stellate neurons for at least 3 months post-lesion. Anterograde tracing analyses exhibited a progressive decline of TCA fiber density in barrel field for 6 months post-lesion. Due to the abrupt decrease of TCA fiber density at 3 days after compression, we further used electron microscopy to investigate the ultrastructure of TCA fibers at this time. Some TCA fiber terminal profiles with dissolved or darkened mitochondria and fewer synaptic vesicles were distorted and broken. Furthermore, the disruption of mitochondria and myelin sheath was observed in some myelinated TCA fibers. In addition, expressions of oxidative markers 3-nitrotyrosine and 4-hydroxynonenal were elevated in barrel field post-lesion. Treatment of antioxidant ascorbic acid or apocynin was able to reverse the increase of oxidative stress and the decline of TCA fiber density, rather than the shrinkage of dendrites and the stripping of dendritic spines of stellate neurons post-lesion. Together, these results indicate that sustained epidural compression of primary somatosensory cortex affects the TCA fibers and the dendrites of stellate neurons for a prolonged period. In addition, oxidative stress is responsible for the reduction of TCA fiber density in barrels rather than the shrinkage of dendrites and the stripping of dendritic spines of stellate neurons.",

Much less is known about effects of eltoprazine in other therapeutic indications. Indeed, the pharmacological profile of eltoprazine might suggest its effects on anxiety and food intake, but also adverse effect potential, which is the focus of the present study. Given for 2 weeks either as infusion or as twice-daily treatment, eltoprazine produced a decrease in food intake and body weight at doses leading to 200-500 nM plasma concentrations. In the elevated plus maze eltoprazine increased anxiety‑like behavior. On the other hand, it induced a clear‑cut anxiolytic effect in context fear conditioning test starting at ca. 0.3 mg/kg, and failed to produce any significant effect in fear potentiated startle test. Regarding adverse effects, eltoprazine was found to produce hypothermia starting from 1 mg/kg. At s imilar doses it also increased locomotion in the open field. However, eltoprazine failed to affect acquisition in context fear conditioning paradigm, which may indicate lack of its detrimental effect on learning at the doses tested (i.e., up to 5 mg/kg). In summary, effects of eltoprazine in different anxiety tests were equivocal while its effect on body weight seems robust and requires further investigation. It is to be determined whether these effects can be expected at the doses free of adverse effects.",

This pontine area is activated after the gastrointestinal administration of rewarding nutrients, in taste aversion learning, and in response to the reinforcing and aversive effects of some drugs of abuse. Electrical stimulation of this region can induce, in different animals, preference or aversion behaviors towards a place in a rectangular three-chamber maze task. This study examined the effect of tiapride, a D2/D3 receptor antagonist, on the aversive or rewarding effects induced by electrical stimulation of the external lateral parabrachial subnucleus (NLPBe). As previously observed, administration of tiapride interrupted the aversive effect induced by NLPBe electrical stimulation. However, in contrast to the effects of dopamine antagonists on other rewarding systems, tiapride did not impair the place preference induced by NLPBe stimulation, an activation effect that is subject to tolerance. Tiapride administration also appeared to have no effect on the horizontal motor activity (crossings) of the electrically stimulated animals. We discuss the specific relevance of parabrachial reward with respect to other reinforcing brain components or systems, especially in relation to the preference effect of drugs of abuse, such as opiates, after dopamine antagonist administration.",

During the rehabilitation of patients with CP, attention is paid to improving mobility which can have a significant impact on the child's development. The effectiveness of rehabilitation depends on the plasticity of the nervous system, which may be genetically determined. Of importance are the various polymorphisms of the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene. It has been shown that the Val/Val genotype may predispose children to greater improvements in function and its maintenance. However, subjects with the Met allele showed a reduced tendency to improve their motor functions but had significantly better results on indirect tests assessing gait function. Fifty subjects with CP participated in this study. They were divided into two groups by genotype and examined on their rehabilitation progress in terms of improved gait function. The results correlated with other studies describing the relationship between the BDNF genotype and learning motor functions in CP, and with numerous studies on the relationship between BDNF genotype and neuroplasticity in stroke patients. This research provides a basis for the identification of genetic biomarkers in patients with CP which can be used to predict the effects of rehabilitation therapy and help with the development of personalized treatments.",

Abnormalities of the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72) gene have been associated with various neurodegenerative diseases. However, its intrinsic roles in AD remain to be elucidated. Here we found that Aβ25‑35 increased the expression of C9orf72 in PC12 cells at both mRNA and protein levels. In Aβ25‑35‑treated PC12 cells, C9orf72 overexpression induced an abnormally condensed and fragmented nucleus and apoptosis, as well as significantly enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Mechanistically, an Aβ25‑35‑induced decrease of superoxide dismutase activity was augmented by C9orf72 overexpression, which in contrast increased malondialdehyde content. Consistently, further apoptotic analysis revealed significant downregulation of Bcl‑2 and Bcl‑xL expression and enhanced cleavage of caspase‑3 with Aβ25‑35 treatment, all of which were exacerbated by C9orf72 overexpression. In addition, tau phosphorylation, another hallmark of AD pathology, was induced by Aβ25‑35 and was remarkably enhanced by C9orf72 overexpression. Our data indicate that C9orf72 plays important roles in intracellular ROS signaling and Aβ25‑35‑induced neuronal apoptosis in AD. These findings provide insights into C9orf72 function in the pathogenesis of many related neurodegenerative diseases and provide a basis for potential therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral edema and elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) are common complications observed following ischemic stroke. Osmotherapy has been used as a foundation to manage ICP induced by cerebral edema, and albumin is one of the most commonly used osmotic agents. The present study aimed to explore whether albumin lowered ICP by reducing cerebral edema when albumin elevated the colloid osmotic pressure (COP) of plasma. Sprague‑Dawley rats that underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion were used to assess COP and ICP. Magnetic resonance imaging measurements were performed to evaluate cerebral edema and infarct size. Evans blue was used to assess the blood‑brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Western blotting was used to determine the expression levels of the tight junction proteins in cerebral vascular endothelial cells. The results showed that 25% albumin treatment (1.25 g/kg) by intravenous injection elevated the COP of plasma but did not reduce the ICP in rats that had undergone ischemic stroke. Additionally, albumin did not reduce the infarct size and instead aggravated cerebral edema. Furthermore, the BBB permeability was increased by albumin. Concomitantly, albumin treatment significantly downregulated the expression of tight junction proteins (ZO‑1, occludin, and claudin‑5) in cerebral vascular endothelial cells. Tight junction protein expression was significantly upregulated when the cells were treated with an MMP‑9 inhibitor (GM6001). These results suggest that albumin aggravates cerebral edema in rats with ischemic stroke by increasing BBB permeability.",

We aimed to compare gene expression changes between the brain and the periphery after chronic lithium administration in an animal model of depression. Depressive behavior was induced by chronic mild stress protocol for 4 weeks. After 2 weeks, rats started to receive lithium (study group) or water (reference group). The control group were rats not exposed to stress. Amygdala, hippocampus, frontal cortex and peripheral blood were analyzed using whole transcriptome expression microarrays. Changes were confirmed with qPCR and ELISA assay. After 2 weeks of lithium administration, we observed significant changes in gene expression between amygdala and peripheral blood. Logistic regression analysis determined Alox15 expression as a predictor of lithium status, as its expression was tissue‑specific and increased in amygdala and decreased in blood. Analysis of serum ALOX15 protein revealed its upregulation after two‑week lithium administration. Our study suggests that lithium may have therapeutic potential in depressive behaviors. These results indicate immunomodulatory effect of lithium and that Alox15 may be a new potential marker of chronic lithium treatment.",

    "abstract": "Voltage-gated sodium channels are critical for the initiation and propagation of action potentials and for the regulation of neuronal excitability. Hyperglycemia and hypoxia are two main changes in diabetes frequently associated with several complications. Although many studies on streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats indicate that early diabetic neuropathy is associated with increased amplitude and faster kinetics of sodium channels, the distinctive roles of high glucose and hypoxia have not been completely clarified. Here we show that hypoxic and high glucose conditions (overnight exposure) increase activation and inactivation of TTX-RINa in DRG neurons without affecting the level of expression. Hypoxia and high glucose alone were potent enough to induce similar or even greater sensitization than when both conditions were present, without any of them having a predominant effect. PKA is mainly responsible of the one condition effect, while under both hypoxia and high glucose PKC was also contributing to alter the kinetics, although not in a cumulative manner. These data indicate that TTX-RINa is significantly modulated under short-time exposure to hypoxia and high glucose, a mechanism which might be relevant for diabetes-related complications or other diseases associated with acute hypoxia.",

It was hypothesized that this facilitation may result from a lesion-induced compensatory increase in dopamine transmission in the intact hemisphere. In the present study we tested on the functional level the hypothesis that the activity of bilateral mesocorticolimbic systems is inversely related. For this purpose we compared the effect of unilateral subthreshold activation with the effect of subsequent unilateral lesion of VTA on feeding response evoked by electrical stimulation of the contralateral VTA. In male Wistar rats implanted with bilateral VTA electrodes stimulation-induced feeding was tested in a latency to feed-stimulation frequency curve-shift paradigm. One electrode was used for induction of feeding reaction and the other electrode was used for concurrent stimulation (with the subthreshold current) and subsequent electrolytic lesioning of the contralateral VTA. It was found that both contralateral stimulation and subsequent lesion performed through the same electrode facilitated a feeding response that manifested as a decrease in the reaction's threshold and a leftward shift of the latency-frequency curve. The paradoxical similarity of the effects of the stimulation and lesion is discussed in terms of functional organization of the mesocorticolimbic system and adaptive changes in dopaminergic transmission.",

We addressed the issue by comparing the effects on neural respiration of a reversible, unilateral, pharmacologic blockade of the motor trigeminal nucleus (5M), the medial parabrachial nucleus (PB), and of other nearby structures that are neutral for respiration in anesthetized, vagotomized, paralyzed, and ventilated cats. The blockade was achieved by microinjections of 2% xylocaine, laced with Pontamine Sky Blue to identify sites of injections, from the tip of a penetrating microelectrode. Integrated phrenic neurograms were recorded to quantify the time of neural inspiration (TI), expiration (TE), and the peak phrenic amplitude. We found that blockade of the 5M caused a pattern of apneustic respiration, consisting of a selective prolongation of inspiratory phases that were interrupted by short expiratory pauses. In contrast, blockade of the PB resulted in a prolongation of both TI and TE, which corresponds to a mere slowing of respiration. The results confirmed important functions of the rostral pons in ventilatory control but pointed to the 5M rather than PB as a structure underlying the inspiratory off-switch. We conclude that the motor trigeminal nucleus may have a part in the pontine pneumotaxic mechanism.",

In control experiments with warm water stimulation no significant alterations of P300 or P200 components were found.

A reduction in mean CBF, mediated by alpha-adrenoceptors, was the predominant effect; it was more often present and larger in size in the vascular beds supplied by the carotid than in those supplied by the vertebro-basilar system. This suggests that the sympathetic action facilitates a redistribution of blood flow to the brain stem. The effect induced by CSN stimulation on CBF spontaneous oscillations was a consistent decrease in amplitude and an increase in frequency, irrespective of the changes produced on the mean level of CBF. The possible implications of the sympathetic action on the state of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are discussed. Experimental and clinical data dealing with the influence of sympathetic activation on the cerebrovascular system have been compared. As a result the possibility of analysing the spontaneous oscillations of CBF for clinical purposes is suggested.",

    "abstract": "A certain proportion of laboratory rats of various strains show spontaneous nonconvulsive ECoG seizures in the form of bursts of spike-and-wave discharges (SWD). Since in the majority of behavioural experiments the EEG is not controlled, the experimenter is usually unaware of this fact. The purpose of the present work was to find out whether the SWD trait is related to the rats behavioural performance in selected test situations. The experiment was performed on two groups of male Wistar rats, outbreds, aged six (group 6M, n = 17) and 24 months (group 24M, n = 14). First, in both groups the following forms of behaviour were assessed: (1) seeking water reward in an 8-arm radial maze, (2) exploration of a new object, (3) inhibition of a locomotor response (passive avoidance), and (4) paw-lick response to a thermal stimulus (54.5°C) applied to the feet before and after intermittent footshock. The rats were then implanted with intrabrain electrodes and the level of SWD activity was assessed. Rats of the 24M group, compared with those of the 6M one, showed a significantly shorter exploratory response to a new object and diminished responsiveness to heat. The groups did not differ, however, in passive avoidance and radial maze performance. The analysis of 3-h ECoG sections revealed SWD bursts in 73% and nearly 93% of rats from groups 6M and 24M, respectively. The groups did not differ in the number of bursts or in the total duration of SWD activity. A correlation analysis of pooled data from both groups revealed that the exploration time of a new object was significantly (negatively) correlated with the number of SWD episodes. The total duration of SWD activity, and the number of perseveration errors in the radial maze, was significantly (positively) correlated with the total duration of SWD activity. The results suggest that SWD rats are behaviourally impaired in some test situations.",

Thin varicose fibers are more numerous and are homogeneously distributed within the claustrum. Remaining fibers were thicker and possessed larger varicosities. They were present mainly in the ventral part of the claustrum.

    "abstract": "New features of actual choice behavior and effortful information processing in rats were demonstrated in an eight-arm radial maze through modifications of a matching-to-sample task. Two attempts were allowed for a squad of hooded Sprague-Dawley rats (n=7) for finding a reward in a testing phase of the task. The results showed flexibility and sooner learning to matching rule on the second testing attempt that was only later followed by an improvement of choice accuracy on the first attempt. \"Hidden learning\" on the second attempt could reflect memories and behavioral strategy, which were present, but not expressed on the first choice. The hypothesis was advanced that learning expressed on the second attempt reflects encoding of a matching rule, whereas improvement on the first choice reflects changes in the rank of acquired memories and behavioral strategy. A second experiment on the same squad of rats tested the ability of trained animals to rank already acquired memories. Following the introduction of the second sample to the study phase of the task, the rats learned to prefer to match the first sample in the testing phase, rearranging ranks of stored memories under the internal control of win-stay strategy. Alternative explanations of interference, trace decay and ranking were compared in order to account for the present results.",

Several animal models have contributed to our understanding of the underlying neuromechanisms. The review was based on a PubMed search using the terms \"hemispherectomy\" and \"mouse\" or \"rat\" or \"rodent\", with no limitation of year of study or language. We identified a series of elements that were collected and analyzed that add up to our contemporary knowledge of this procedure. Our search returned 29 articles out of which only 15 are relevant to our purposes. Most of the current literature is concerned with the different molecular and electrophysiological issues of neuroplasticity, exhibiting the neurochemical background on which brain plasticity is founded. Experimental neurosurgery is quintessential in understanding the process in which various pathologies respond to in vivo animal models and recreating conditions otherwise difficult or impossible to obtain in humans. The aim of our study was to evaluate the current literature on the modern comprehension that animal models offer for histopathological, neurochemical and microsurgical research. In addition, the review is focused on the neuroplastic/compensatory mechanisms developed after hemispherectomy. Further research is of vital importance in exploring neurotherapeutical aspects of neuroplasticity in central nervous system (CNS) diseases.",

    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP‑2, MMP‑3, and MMP‑9, have been implicated as important players in mechanisms underlying various forms of neuroplasticity. In particular, MMP‑3 was found to be involved in both cognitive functions and in plasticity phenomena, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely elusive. In general, it is believed that functional plasticity of neurons is associated with morphological alterations. Interestingly, MMP‑9, in addition to playing a key role in synaptic plasticity, was found to affect plasticity‑related spine morphology changes. Whereas the involvement of MMP‑3 in shaping synapse morphology upon induction of synaptic plasticity awaits determination, it has been demostrated that MMP‑3 knockout results in clearly altered apical dendrite morphology in pyramidal neurons in mouse visual cortex. Considering that the involvement of MMP‑3 in synaptic plasticity has been most extensively documented for the CA1 hippocampal region, we decided to investigate whether genetic deletion of MMP‑3 affects neuronal morphology in this area. To this end, we used Golgi staining to compare dendritic morphology of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region in MMP‑3‑deficient and wild‑type mice. Surprisingly, in contrast to the results obtained in cortex, extensive analysis of dendritic morphology in the CA1 region revealed no significant differences between MMP‑3 knockout and wild‑type groups. These results suggest that the impact of MMP‑3 on neuronal morphology may be region‑specific.",

Lin28 expression was upregulated by in utero electroporation at E14.5. Two days later, electroporated cortices were dissociated for culturing primary cortical neurons. We found that Lin28 overexpression, which was confirmed immunocytochemically, led to neurite underdevelopment for all time points during culture. Specifically, Lin28-overexpressing cells displayed significantly fewer primary neurites and a decreased dendritic branching index, compared to GFP-expressing controls. Additionally, Lin28 overexpression in primary cortical neurons induced the expression of high mobility group AT-Hook 2 (HMGA2). Taken together, our study demonstrates that constitutive Lin28 expression disrupts cortical neurogenesis resulting in impaired neurite outgrowth with a concomitant induction of HMGA2.",

    "abstract": "Glucocorticoids arising from chronic stress and long-term inflammatory treatment with corticosteroids are both associated with neuropathology and cognitive impairments. Many previous studies have focused on changes in brain morphology and deficits in learning behavior. However, effects of long-term exposure to stress hormones on electrical brain signaling and sleep-wake patterns have remained largely unexplored. This study aimed to monitor electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns induced by prolonged dexamethasone exposure. Adult male Wistar rats implanted with electrodes on the skull over the frontal and parietal cortices were intraperitoneally injected with either saline or dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg) once daily for 21 consecutive days. Longitudinal EEG recording was performed on day 6, 11, 16 and 21. Fast Fourier transform was used for frequency power analysis. One-way ANOVA revealed significant increases in parietal EEG power of slow frequencies (delta, theta and alpha) particularly, with the dominant theta activity seen as early as day 11 of dexamethasone treatment. Sleep-wake analysis on day 21 confirmed a significant reduction of rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep and increased slow frequency oscillations mainly in the parietal cortex during the awake period. The number of high-voltage spindles (HVSs) (6-10 Hz EEG oscillation) was significantly increased during awake and slow wave sleep (SWS) periods following dexamethasone treatment. These findings demonstrated that distinct frequency oscillations, sleep-wakefulness and sleep spindles may be parameters of neuropathology produced by long-term dexamethasone exposure. Early detection of these parameters might be predictive of neuropathology in long-term corticosteroid users.",

    "abstract": "Post-stroke neurological deficits, such as sensorimotor impairments, are often permanent and a leading cause of disability. Stroke is also associated with changes in neuronal synchrony among different brain areas. Multiple studies demonstrated that non-invasive brain stimulation, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), enhances the efficacy of existing rehabilitative therapies. We hypothesized that the therapeutic effects of tDCS could be due to its influence on neuronal synchrony. To study this, we recorded local field potentials in rats treated with anodal tDCS (a-tDCS) after unilateral ischemic motor cortex lesion. To enhance the effect of a-tDCS on neuronal synchrony, we added monopolar pulses (a-tDCSmp) during a treatment. We found that ischemic lesions reduced interhemispheric coherence in the low gamma frequency range. By contrast, a-tDCSmp treatment increased interhemispheric coherence along with motor improvement in a skilled reaching task. These observations indicate that increased neuronal coherence is a likely mechanism by which tDCS improves stroke recovery. Moreover, this work adds to previous evidence that measures of brain coherence could be used as a biomarker of stroke recovery, which may help in the design of more effective tDCS protocols for stroke rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "Perceptual estimates of spatial dimensions of visual objects depend on their shape and surface attributes. The present psychophysical study emphasizes two main contributors to the Oppel‑Kundt illusion: the outline of the filled space and the mode of filling. In past experiments, both factors have been considered significant. Our experiments were performed by using combined stimuli of the Oppel‑Kundt figures and supplementary objects situated within the empty intervals of the figures. Line segments, empty and filled rectangles, blurred contours, and grey and color images were used for the supplementary stimuli role. The experimental data demonstrated an innate property of the objects to balance the illusion of distance if they were placed within the Oppel‑Kundt figure and to create an illusion of extent when compared with an empty space interval. Both the balance magnitude and the induced illusion strength varied depending on the objects' spatial structure. The supplementary objects showed a tendency to differ from each other by their functional capacity and were ranked from lowest to highest: a line segment, a solid bar with a blurred outline, a contour of a rectangle, a solid fill rectangle, greyscale patterns, and color pictures. The experimental findings provided support for an explanation of the Oppel‑Kundt illusion in terms of the spatial‑temporal summation of excitations representing the object outline and surface attributes at the lower cortical levels of the visual system. Along with the facts already established in current literature, the experimental data gave rise to the assumption that any visual object could appear larger than its occupied area, and that the Oppel‑Kundt illusion could become a separate case in the common sensory phenomenon of object size illusion.",

For this purpose, an experimental hemiparkinsonic animal model was used in the study. Rotational movements in hemiparkinsonic animals were initiated by the intraperitoneal administration of the dopamine receptor agonist apomorphine. It was shown that a preliminary injection of C60FAS (a substance with powerful antioxidant properties) in hemiparkinsonic rats induced distinct changes in animal motor behavior. It was revealed that fullerene‑pretreated animals, in comparison with non‑pretreated or vehicle‑pretreated rats, rotated for 1 h at an approximately identical speed until the end of the experiment, whereas the rotation speed of control rats gradually decreased to 20-30% of the initial value. One can assume that the observed changes in the movement dynamics of the hemiparkinsonic rats after C60FAS pretreatment presumably can be induced by the influence of C60FAS on the dopaminergic system, although the isolated potentiation of the action of apomorphine C60FAS cannot be excluded. Nevertheless, earlier data on the action of C60FAS on muscle dynamics has suggested that C60FAS can activate a protective action of the antioxidant system in response to long‑lasting muscular activity and that the antioxidant system in turn may directly decrease fatigue‑relate d changes during long‑lasting muscular activity.",

Due to the fact that literature shows that even low doses of caffeine may improve cognitive performance, we investigated an acute effect of a single dose of a caffeinated energy dietary supplement, on attention and motor responses by means of event related potentials. Healthy volunteers were examined in double blind, placebo controlled study. EEG recordings from 32 channels were performed in three sessions: before the supplementation (session 1), 30 min after the supplementation (session 2) and 90 min after the supplementation (session 3) in three tasks: visual P3, auditory P3, and motor task. Repeated measures ANOVA analysis showed reduced P3 amplitude increase after energy dietary supplementation (compared to placebo group) throughout all sessions (up to 90 min after consumption) in the visual task, and speeding the classification process observed as a decrease of P3 midpoint latency, but only 30 min after supplementation. The latter effect was present in both, but more pronounced in the visual task. Nonparametric cluster based permutation analysis showed one significant cluster in the placebo group from visual P3 task (approximately between 400 and 520 ms) over the centro‑parietal area, which was absent in the study group. Our results suggest that caffeinated energy dietary supplement containing only 55 mg of caffeine may enhance some attentional processes observed by changes in P3 features, but not in motor performance.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate changes in the motor unit output and to determine changes in the optimal stimulation frequency (i.e., giving the maximal output per one pulse) during prolonged contractile activity when, successively, potentiation of force and fatigue developed. The influence of these phenomena was studied on three types of motor units: fast fatigable (FF), fast resistant (FR) and slow (S) in the rat medial gastrocnemius muscle. The motor units were isolated by a method of splitting of L5 ventral root into very thin bundles of axons which were electrically stimulated 10 times with repeated series of 10 trains of stimuli at duration of 500 ms and progressively increasing (1-150 Hz) frequency. The initial (the first series of stimulating trains), potentiated (the second series), as well as fatigued (the tenths series) force recordings were compared. The motor unit output was expressed as the area under the force-time record in response to one stimulus measured at a plateau phase of the tetanic force. The stimulation frequency when the force-time area per one pulse was maximal was accepted as the optimal frequency. In fast motor units, the maximal contractile output increased with potentiation and was reduced with fatigue, and the optimal frequency decreased and increased, respectively. Nevertheless, the fusion degrees of the optimal tetanic contractions were similar in initial state, potentiation and fatigue independently of the changes in force. The applied stimulation protocol had almost no influence on the mechanical activity of slow motor units. The study highlights the physiological importance of force potentiation induced by preceding contractile activity for the economy of motor performance. The observed changes of the optimal stimulation frequency are consistent with the known changes in the motor unit firing rates during voluntary activity when the two phenomena develop.Correspondence should be addressed to D.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of pressure exerted on potassium currents in acutely isolated inner hair cells of the guinea-pig cochlea using whole-cell voltage-clamp techniques. By applying negative or positive pressure via the patch pipette using a syringe, intracellular hydropressure was changed between −40 cm H2O to +20 cm H2O. Negative pressure potentiated the amplitude of potassium currents, whereas positive pressure suppressed the amplitude of potassium currents. Gadolinium, a blocker of stretch-activated cation channels, did not influence pressure-dependent changes in potassium currents; however, cinnarizine blocked pressure-dependent changes in potassium currents. The current changes were not dependent on the sign of the pressure change, that is, similar increases in negative pressures (between −10 cm H2O and −40 cm H2O) and similar decreases in positive pressures (between +10 cm H2O and +20 cm H2O) were observed.",

    "abstract": "Response generalization to a novel stimulus occurs when the new stimulus shares common features with the stimulus used in the original learning. Given the many recent studies suggesting that the perirhinal cortex is critical for disambiguating stimuli that share representational/perceptual elements, we hypothesize that lesions sustained to this region would attenuate response generalization. In the first part of this experiment lesioned and control rats learned a feature-ambiguous tactual discrimination task until they had all reached the same level of performance. In this task animals were asked to discriminate among 3 tactual stimuli simultaneously exposed in 3 arms of a 4-arm plus-shaped maze. In the second part of this experiment, the same rats were given a generalization test 24 h after acquisition of the tactual discrimination. In the generalization test the original tactual stimulus associated with reward during the learning of the discrimination was replaced by a novel tactual stimulus while the other two remained the same. Of the 3 stimuli used in the generalization test, the novel stimulus had the highest degree of feature overlap with respect to the original target stimulus used during the learning of the discrimination. The generalization test took place over two consecutive days, with 8 trials each day. On the first day of generalization, the results indicated that the lesioned rats generalized significantly worse than the control rats during the first 4 trials, but not during the last 4 trials. On the second day of generalization, however, both groups performed the test perfectly. These findings suggest that, in addition to the well-known mnesic function in object processing, the perirhinal cortex may also be involved in perceptual functions.",

    "abstract": "Ataxias are neurological disorders associated with the degeneration of Purkinje cells (PCs).Homozygous weaver mice (wv/wv) have been proposed as a model for hereditary cerebellar ataxia because they present motor abnormalities and PC loss.To ascertain the physiopathology of the weaver condition, the development of the cerebellar cortex lobes was examined at postnatal day (P): P8, P20 and P90.Three approaches were used:1) quantitative determination of several cerebellar features;2) qualitative evaluation of the developmental changes occurring in the cortical lobes; and 3) autoradiographic analyses of PC generation and placement.Our results revealed a reduction in the size of the wv/wv cerebellum as a whole, confirming previous results.However, as distinguished from these reports, we observed that quantified parameters contribute differently to the abnormal growth of the wv/wv cerebellar lobes.Qualitative analysis showed anomalies in wv/wv cerebellar cytoarchitecture, depending on the age and lobe analyzed.Such abnormalities included the presence of the external granular layer after P20 and, at P90, ectopic cells located in the molecular layer following several placement patterns.Finally, we obtained autoradiographic evidence that wild-type and wv/wv PCs presented similar neurogenetic timetables, as reported.However, the innovative character of this current work lies in the fact that the neurogenetic gradients of wv/wv PCs were not modified from P8 to P90.A tendency for the accumulation of late-formed PCs in the anterior and posterior lobes was found, whereas early-generated PCs were concentrated in the central and inferior lobes.These data suggested that wv/wv PCs may migrate properly to their final destinations.The extrapolation of our results to patients affected with cerebellar ataxias suggests that all cerebellar cortex lobes are affected with several age-dependent alterations in cytoarchitectonics.We also propose that PC loss may be regionally variable and not related to their neurogenetic timetables.",

In the present study, a step-down passive avoidance test was used to investigate whether DMNG-3 could modulate impairment of learning and memory induced by scopolamine, and a high performance liquid chromatography(HPLC) method for the determination of DMNG-3 in biological samples was applied to study its pharmacokinetics and tissues distribution. Separation was achieved on C18 column using a mobile phase consisting methanol-water (70:30, v/v) at a flow rate of 1.0ml/min. The intra- and inter-day precisions were good and the RSD was all lower than 1.30%. The mean absolute recovery of DMNG-3 in plasma ranged from 88.55 to 96.45 %. Our results showed oral administration of DMNG-3(10,25,50 mg/kg/day) can significantly improve the latency and number of errors and had a positive effect of improvement of learning and memory in mice in passive avoidance tests. The elimination half-life (T1/2) was 14.07±1.29, 15.87±1.03h, and the total clearance (CL) values were 0.70±0.11, 0.78±0.13 L/h/kg, respectively. The pharmacokinetic studies showed that DMNG-3 has a slowly clearance and large distribution volume in experimental animals, and its disposition is linear over the range of doses tested. The liver, small intestine, stomach, and large intestine were the major distribution tissues of DMNG-3 in mice. It was found that DMNG-3 could be detected in brain, suggesting that DMNG-3 can cross the blood-brain barrier. The present study shows that DMNG-3 can be possible developed as a new drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in the future.",

Patients with PD demonstrated an increase in lymphocyte CD95/CD3 ratio as well as a considerable number of cells dead due to apoptotic processes. After treatment with L-DOPA, both the CD95/CD3 ratio, assumed to represent an antigen marker characteristic of apoptotic cells, and the number of cells dead due to apoptotic processes were found to be decreased. Thus, the findings indicate that levodopa treatment in PD has an impact on apoptotic processes and this should be taken into consideration as a positive event in the pathomechanism precipitated by this treatment.",

The BMSCs are easily isolated from the patients themselves and transplanted into them without any ethical and immunological problem. Animal experiments have shown that BMSC transplantation significantly enhance the recovery of motor and/or cognitive function in various types of neurological disorders such as ischemic stroke. The transplanted BMSCs aggressively migrate toward the damaged tissue and proliferate in the host brain. The BMSCs significantly improve the neuronal receptor function and local glucose metabolism in the peri-infarct area when transplanted into the infarct brain. Recent studies strongly suggest that the BMSCs contain heterogeneous subpopulations and contribute to functional recovery through multiple mechanisms, including neuroprotection, inflammatory modulation, cell fusion, and neural differentiation. The author describes the importance to establish BMSC transplantation as a therapeutic entity that is scientifically proven.",

The aim of this study was to describe the pattern of distribution of CB-, PV- and CR-immunoreactive elements in the rabbit corticomedial amygdaloid complex during the postnatal period. The time course of changes in CaBPs expression during maturation of the selected nuclei indicates their diversity. During the first month after birth, CaBPs expression stabilizes earliest in the anterior cortical and then in the medial nuclei. Later, during the second month of postnatal life, the posteromedial and posterolateral cortical nuclei maturate. The central nucleus requires a considerably longer time to reach maturity – about three months are needed to stabilize CaBPs expression in all its subdivisions. This nucleus also shows the most differentiated, time-dependent distribution of CaBPs immunoreactivity (especially CB), distinct in its divisions. The differences in the CaBPs immunoreactivity confirm previous reports concerning dissimilar origin and development, and also reflect the diversity of connectivity of the amygdaloid body – the collection of nuclei, considered as one functional integrity.",

The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between disability level in multiple sclerosis (estimated by Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale), disease progression (estimated by Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score), the level of brain atrophy and lesion load (determined by MRI) and detoxification status (analyzing glutathione S-transferase P1, GSTP1, genotype profile), in a group of 58 MS patients and 68 age/gendermatched controls. The results present the first evidence on significantly higher frequency of GSTP1 C341T polymorphism (C-T transition) in healthy subjects compared to MS patients, suggesting it may act as a moderating factor in developing MS clinical phenotype. Gender-dependent distribution of the C341T polymorphism was found in both MS patients and controls, with higher frequency of C-T transition in females. In addition, preliminary data showed higher proportion of male MS patients with higher median MSSS scores, as well as lower brain atrophy level and lesion load in MS patients carrying the C341T mutation. Observed gender difference in distribution of the C341T polymorphism in MS patients, as well as in disease progression, suggests that GSTP1 detoxification pathway occurs in a gender-dependent manner and could therefore add to clinical severity in male MS patients.",

We examined whether early haloperidol administration to Wistar-Albino-Glaxo dams from Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) and in Wistar control rats would affect maternal care and as a consequence, seizure susceptibility and behavior in the WAG/Rij?s offspring at 3-4 months of age. Nursing dams of this well-validated genetic animal model of absence epilepsy and control dams were injected with haloperidol or saline at PPD 1 to 6. Maternal behavior was evaluated at PPD 7 to 9. Haloperidol-injected WAG/Rij dams showed more pup carryings compared with saline-injected mothers, this effect was not noticed in control Wistar dams. The offspring of haloperidol-treated WAG/Rij dams, tested during adulthood, showed heightened behavioral activity (time spent into the open arms, head dips) in the elevated plus-maze, as well as shorter spikewave discharges (SWD) as measured in their electroencephalographic activity compared with saline-treated rats. Overall, it can be concluded that deviancies in the DA system as induced by haloperidol facilitates pup carrying/retrieval behavior in WAG/Rij rats and reduces seizure activity of the offspring in adulthood. Therefore, inter-individual differences in seizure properties and behavior in genetically predisposed animals may be due to differences in maternal behavior of the dams.",

Ang II and Ang II(3-7), given intracerebroventricularly (icv) at the dose of 1 nmole each, substantially improved object recognition memory and enhanced apomorphine (l mg/kg) stereotypy. Pre-treatment of rats with CGP 42112A (2 micrograms), per se ineffective in all tests, abolished activity of both peptides. None of the treatments significantly changed behaviour of rats in open field. The results point to the considerable involvement of the AT2 angiotensin receptors in the improvement of recognition memory caused by Ang II and Ang II(3-7).",

    "abstract": "Incubation of the acutely dissected rat hippocampal slices in calcium-containing media resulted in spontaneous activation-translocation of classical PKC isoforms and their subsequent (especially gamma-type) proteolytic degradation. These changes were blocked by calpain inhibitor MDL 28 170 in 100 microM concentration. Rat hippocampal slices were metabolically prelabelled with 32Pi and stimulated with NMDA/glycine, depolarization or phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu) treatment. The basal phosphorylation of specific PKC substrates (MARCKS, neuromodulin and neurogranin) was significantly reduced in non-stimulated slices by MDL pretreatment. In contrast, only the slices where calpain activity was inhibited responded to further NMDA or phorbol dibutyrate stimulation by a substantial increase of PKC-dependent protein phosphorylation. It is concluded that the PKC phosphorylation system is severely affected by non-specific activation and a subsequent, calpain-dependent proteolysis in the acutely prepared hippocampal slices. Calpain inhibition by 100 microM MDL partially prevented these changes and increased stimulus-dependent phosphorylation of PKC-specific protein substrates.",

The specific binding of [3H]DHA to duck cerebral cortical membranes was found to be rapid, stable, saturable, reversible, and of high affinity. Saturation analysis resulted in a linear Scatchard plot suggesting binding to a single class of receptor binding sites with high affinity (Kd = 1.18 nM) and high capacity (Bmax = 162 fmol/mg protein). Competition studies showed the following relative rank order of potency of various compounds to inhibit the [3H]DHA binding: antagonists--ICI 118,551 > S(-)-propranolol >> betaxolol, yohimbine, WB-4101, prazosin, mianserine; agonists--isoprenaline approximately equal to fenoterol > salbutamol >> clonidine, phenylephrine. The obtained data suggest that in duck cerebral cortex beta-adrenergic receptors (like those described in brains of chick and pigeon) are of the beta 2 subtype. This is in contrast to what has been reported for the mammalian brain, where--among beta-adrenoceptors--the beta 1 subtype is predominant.",

Desmosome-like junctions connecting astrocytic elements were also seen. As described earlier, astrocytic processes were occasionally interdigitated with oligodendroglial cells and their processes. Two types of macrophages were readily described. The majority of them exhibited electron-dense cytoplasm and numerous \"empty\" vacuoles (digestive chambers) containing cellular debris. Occasional vacuoles were surrounded by a thin collar reminiscent of \"lyre-like inclusions\" of the second type of macro phages. Several mylinated fibres were clearly engulfed by the cytoplasm of a macrophage containing unusual annulate lamellae.",

Interhemispheric mnemonic communication is thus highly reliable. At longer retention intervals (1-2 min vs. 4-30 s, with accumulating added stimuli), however, recognition of words was asymmetric as to hemisphere, in that initial viewing via the right hemisphere was subsequently (and paradoxically) much better recognized via the left (other) hemisphere than was the converse situation.

    "abstract": "The Mongolian gerbil has been widely used as a global brain ischemia model because of its incomplete cerebral circle of Willis. However, the inter-individual anatomic variability of this vascular structure interferes with the reliability of the model. The aim of this work was to introduce modifications to the protocol of global brain ischemia experiments in Mongolian gerbils in an attempt to increase the reliability and usefulness of this model. Our study focused on the assessment of the level of anastomosis of the cerebral circle of Willis in order to evaluate its contribution to clinicopathological outcomes in this model. Sham-operated, Ischemic, and Ischemic + Hypothermia animals were subjected to a 15-minute occlusion of the common carotid arteries. Transcardiac perfusion with bromophenol blue / gelatin solution was performed 72 hours after ischemia. Brains were processed for anatomopathological analysis. Tissue damage was observed in the hippocampus, caudate-putamen nucleus, neocortex, and thalamic nuclei of animals from the Ischemic group. The circles of Willis of the Sham-operated animals showed bilateral (38 percent), unilateral (48 percent) or no posterior communicating arteries (14 percent). A negative correlation between infarct volume and the level of anastomosis was revealed for the Ischemic, but not for the Ischemic + Hypothermia group. Additionally, Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed to assess the contribution of the level of anastomosis to the clinicopathological outcomes. It was confirmed that the infarct volume decreased in the Ischemic + Hypothermia group when compared to the Ischemic group. Since the level of anastomosis cannot be predicted, this variable should necessarily be considered when analyzing the results of global brain ischemia in Mongolian gerbils.",

In the present experiment, male and female subjects made odd versus even classification judgments on numbers presented visually in three different formats: digits, number words, and dot patterns. Males showed longer decision times for odd numbers only when the numbers were presented in the dot pattern format. Females showed this effect only when the stimuli were presented in the word format. These results suggest that a differential speed of response to odd and even numbers is found most strongly when the stimuli are presented in a format which is processed more efficiently by the subjects.

[3H]AA release was much more pronounced in PND 7-10 rats than in adults, and the response to NMDA in the hippocampal slices exceeded the reactions in the striatal slices. The subsequent experiments, employing only hippocampal slices of PND 7-10 rats, demonstrated that NMDA-stimulated [3H]AA release was dose-dependent in the micromolar range, was sensitive to NMDA receptor antagonists, and was inhibited in calcium-free medium and in the presence of quinacrine. [3H]AA release induced by 100 microM NMDA was not significantly inhibited by magnesium but was completely blocked by 7 Cl-kynurenic acid and ifenprodil (both antagonists 100 microM). The sulfhydryl reducing reagent dithiothreitol induced [3H]AA release; this response was sensitive to NMDA receptor antagonists. These data indicate that the NMDA induced, calcium triggered, and phospholipase A2 dependent AA release is highly pronounced in the developing rat hippocampus. NMDA receptors mediating AA release in the hippocampus of PND 7-10 rats are subject to glycine, polyamine and redox modulation, but they show low sensitivity to Mg2+ inhibition.",

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. In the presence of 60 mM K+ a decrease of pH leads to loss of [3~]~~~+ from intact synaptosomes (Fig. I), indicating mitochondrial depolarization. This effect was reversible up to pH 6.0 with distinct irreversibility beginning at pH4.5. After permeabilization of synaptosomes a s ecific blocker of mitochondrial calcium ZP, transport ruthenium red (10 yM) at pH 7.4 inhibited the total uptake of 45~a by 50% as compared with 20% value obtained on intact synaptosomes. Ruthenium red-inhibitable calcium transport in digitonin-treated synaptosomes exhibits 3 the same sensitivity to low pH as [ H]TPP+ accumulation showing a link between acidosis-induced depolarization and a blockage of calcium uniporter function in mitochondria. We observed a similar pH dependence for calcium transport inhibitable by combination of CCCP (10 yM) and oligomycin (4 yg/ml) thereby supporting a mitochondrial nature of transport. Our results are in accordance with those described for mitochondria isolated from ferret heart (I). Thus, there is a decrease in accumulating activity of calcium in a mitochondrial store under acidosis.

    "abstract": "Discrimination learning of instrumental responses to auditory compound stimuli was investigated in opossums using the R-no R (go-no go) differentiation. Each compound stimulus consisted of two factors: quality and location. Each correct response performed to the conditioned positive, or \"safe\" stimulus, was rewarded by food and never punished. Each incorrect response performed to the conditioned negative, or \"warning\" stimulus, was punished by an electric shock. In subsequent testing, each opossum proved to use only the quality cues to solve the task even though later testing showed them capable of using the location cues. Thus, the rule discovered in higher mammals, that the efficacy of auditory stimuli in differentiation depends on the perceptual ability of the animal as well as the type of the behavioral response with which the animal is confronted, may be extended to neurologically primitive mammals and also to a joint conditioned approach-avoidance method.",

This review deals with the regulation of HIOMT by environmental light and with the developmental aspects of HIOMT expression in chicken and rat. Early studies based on HIOMT activity measurements and more recent studies involving cDNA hybridization to HIOMT mRNA are taken into consideration. Together, the data reveal that long term regulation of HIOMT by light would rely on a day/night rhythm of HIOMT gene transcription, coupled to a slow turnover of the protein. Rapid changes in HIOMT mRNA levels and early expression during embryonic development suggest that further studies on this gene may shed light on the molecular mechanisms involved in the differentiation of the melatoninergic function and in its regulation by light, both in the pineal gland and in the retina.",

The transport was found to be sensitive to ATP, ATP gamma S, ADP and to the triazine dyes, but not to AMP and cAMP. The inhibition induced by ATP was observed in the absence of externally added Mg2+, suggesting that a free nucleotide, rather than the ATP-Mg complex, was required for inhibition. Furthermore, the 86Rb+ influx was found to be inhibited by Mg2+ alone, but not by Ca2+ and antidiabetic sulfonylureas. The 86Rb+ influx was not stimulated by potassium channel openers. In conclusion, our results indicate that an electrogenic, ATP-sensitive potassium transport system operates in the chromaffin granule membrane.",

Following injections of fluorescent tracers Fast Blue (FB) and Diamidino Yellow (DY) within rPML and cPML, respectively, substantial numbers of FB and DY single labeled neurons were found in the dorsolateral, paramedian, lateral and peduncular pontine nuclei bilaterally with a very clearcut contralateral preponderance. No labeling was observed in the ventral pontine nucleus. Extensive areas of overlap of FB or DY labeled neurons indicated that no somatotopical relationship existed in projection from PN to the two functionally different PML target regions. In addition, a small number of double FB + DY labeled neurons was detected in the common areas of FB and DY single labeling in PN. These neurons give rise to pontocerebellar projections to rPML and cPML simultaneously by way of axonal collaterals and thus they may play a role in the coordination of unilateral forelimb and hindlimb movements.",

    "abstract": "The regulation of firing thresholds of cortical pyramidal cells has been suggested as one of the mechanisms underlying the generation of the P300 component of the human event-related potential. According to this hypothesis, the detection of an important stimulus produces a widespread inhibition of \"irrelevant\" networks, interrupting the ongoing cortical activity and facilitating the analysis of the important information. In the present experiment, target stimuli in a standard \"odd-ball\" paradigm were used as important events. The cortical responsiveness was measured using the responses to additional probing stimuli delivered 400 ms and 1,000 ms after target and non-target stimuli. The subjects were asked to count mentally the target stimuli and ignore the non-targets and the probes. The level of \"irrelevant\" cortical activity was manipulated using additional visual noise stimulation. Event-related potentials were recorded at Fz, Cz, Pz and Oz scalp sites. Our results showed that the noise reduced the initial responses to target and non-target stimuli in Oz, Pz and Cz but not in Fz recordings. The noise reduced the probe responses in Oz and Pz but not in Cz and Fz recordings. The amplitudes of P300 components were not affected by the noise. The target stimuli reduced the subsequent probe responses in Pz and Cz but not in Oz and Fz recordings. Thus, the effects of noise and target detection were not identical in the different regions of cortex. The other important outcome of our study was that the target stimuli suppressed the effects of noise. The effect of noise on probe responses was significant in the non-target but not in the target trials. The effect of noise was significant if the probes were delivered 1,000 ms after \"odd-ball\" stimuli, but it was insignificant when the delay was only 400 ms. Such results support the hypothesis that important information reduces cortical responses to other, irrelevant stimuli.",

Rats were trained in a rapidly acquired, appetitively motivated foraging task based on olfactory discrimination. They were injected with a adrenergic receptor antagonist into the PL 5 min or 2 h after training and tested 48 h later. Rats injected at 2 h showed amnesia, whereas those injected at 5 min had good retention, equivalent to saline-injected controls. Monitoring extracellular noradrenaline efflux in PL by in vivo microdialysis during the first hours after training revealed a significant increase shortly after training, with a rapid return to baseline, and then another increase around the 2-h posttraining time window. Pseudo-trained rats showed a smaller early efflux and did not show the second wave of efflux at 2 h. These results confirm earlier pharmacological and immunohistochemical studies suggesting a delayed role of noradrenaline in a late phase of long-term memory consolidation and the engagement of the PL during these consolidation processes.",

In our paper we investigate spiking activity of the neuron model activated tonically by NMDA synapse, when the membrane ionic currents are dynamically dependent on calcium concentration, as in a model by Abbott and coauthors (1993). A spiking neuron model (in Matlab/Simulink environment) is based on the properties of lamprey spinal neurons. The basic neuron is a one-compartment model with voltage-gated Na+, K+, Ca2+, KCa+ channels. The Na+ and K+ currents are described with the dynamic equations of Hodgkin-Huxley model (Hodgkin and Huxley 1952). The Ca2+ and KCa+ channels are modeled using description of calcium dynamic introduced by Ekeberg and coauthors (1991). The model was tonically activated by NMDA synapse described by a kinetic model of synaptic transmission. We analyzed the activity of this model and showed that when only one of conductances is calcium-dependent, the cell is not able to react to and recover from external perturbations.",

Although risperidone did not change neural bases of active attention after two weeks of treatment, the reduction of P2 amplitude suggests that risperidone may affect auditory information processing in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders who never have been exposed to antipsychotic treatment.

Further, Sal-A is the only compound within S. divinorum which is reported to have psychoactive properties as a powerful kappa-opioid receptor (KOPr) agonist. Based on the key role of the KOP system in the consumption of drugs, S. divinorum extract (SDE) and Sal-A may modify the alcohol intake in Wistar rats. Assessing voluntary alcohol intake as a drug consummatory behavior, food intake as natural reward behavior and tonic immobility as indicative of anxiety-like behavior, the present study sought to identify the role of both SDE and Sal-A in the Wistar rat model. Forty-eight adult male rats were randomly divided into six groups: control, alcohol naive and vehicle, alcohol-naive and SDE, alcohol-naive and Sal-A, alcohol-consumption and vehicle, alcohol-consumption and SDE, and alcohol-consumption and Sal-A. Alcohol and food intake were assessed for two weeks. In the middle of these two weeks, vehicle, SDE (containing ~1 mg/kg of Sal-A) or Sal-A was injected intraperitoneally once a day for a week. Tonic immobility testing was performed once. The administration of SDE produced a significant increase in voluntary alcohol intake especially in rats with a history of forced alcohol consumption from a juvenile age, Sal-A elicited an increase in alcohol intake in animals with or without previous alcohol exposure, SDE and Sal-A prolonged the tonic immobility duration and decreased food intake. In conclusion, S. divinorum or Sal-A stimulated alcohol consumption in rats with a history of alcohol intake and independent of previous exposure respectively, also SDE or Sal-A elicited an anorexigenic effect, and increased tonic immobility as indicative of anxious-like behavior.",

    "abstract": "At least three well-documented phenomena indicate a relationship between numbers and the internal representation of space. They are shifting attention in accordance with the localization of numbers on the mental number line (MNL); the spatial-numerical association of response codes (SNARC) effect, which manifests as faster responses to high numbers with the right hand than with the left, and vice versa for low numbers; and the processing of both numbers and space primarily in the parietal cortex. Some EEG studies have pointed to the response selection stage as a locus of this effect. However, this explanation has yet to be corroborated by the fMRI experiments. The goal of this study was to investigate the functional anatomy underlying response selection induced by SNARC-congruent and SNARC-incongruent stimuli in a spatial visual cueing task. Healthy adult volunteers responded to a pair of target stimuli consisting of digits, non-digit symbols, or a mix of both. In each trial, the stimuli were preceded by a centrally presented numerical or non-numerical cue stimulus which was required to be memorized. One of the target stimuli that then appeared would be identical to the cue; the task was to determine which side it was presented on, within the pair. In the case of numerical stimuli, the side was congruent with its localization on the MNL in one-half of the trials. In the other half of the trials, it was incongruent. The behavioral results revealed the SNARC effect, as well as a faster reaction to low numbers than to high numbers. The fMRI responses to the target stimuli showed engagement of regions implicated in number processing but also in sensory-motor areas. This suggests that the motor response selection or execution stage may be the locus of the SNARC effect. Yet, the activation pattern obtained in the congruent and incongruent conditions did not allow us to determine, indisputably, the neural correlates of the mechanisms involved in the SNARC effect. Moreover, we did not observe any stimulus-specific responses to cues.",

Estrogen agonist‑treated animals showed a significant elevation in Esr1 mRNA and protein expression levels in the brain tissue of TBI rats. In addition, the data indicated a significant elevation of Esr2 mRNA and protein expression levels in the brain tissue of estrogen agonist‑treated TBI rats.

It is important to understand which mechanism (synergistic or additive anti‑nociceptive activity) induced potent anti‑nociceptive effect by co‑administration of morphine and tramadol. Identification of new strategies that can potentiate analgesic effects of opioids will be good therapeutic approaches for pain relief. To this aim, male mice were cannulated in the left ventricle by a stereotaxic instrument. A tail‑flick test was used to record the pain threshold. The results revealed that intracerebroventricularly injection of morphine induced an anti‑nociceptive effect in non‑sensitized and morphine‑sensitized mice. We found that infusion of tramadol produced an anti‑nociceptive response in non‑sensitized mice, whereas tramadol in doses of 0.5 and 1 μg/mouse induced analgesia in morphine‑sensitized mice. Co‑injection of a non‑effective dose of tramadol or morphine (0.25 μg/mouse) with different doses of morphine or tramadol (0.25, 0.5, and 1 μg/mouse) respectively potentiated the analgesic effect of the previous drug. An isobolographic analysis of data was performed, indicating a synergistic interaction between morphine and tramadol in non‑sensitized and morphine‑sensitized mice. Our data indicated that both morphine and tramadol elicit more anti‑nociceptive response in morphine sensitized mice; there is a synergistic effect between morphine and tramadol upon induction of analgesic effect in non‑sensitized and morphine‑sensitized mice.",

    "abstract": "The intracerebroventricular infusions of genistein (total 40 mug) were made in male sheep (November) to test its influence on melatonin, growth hormone (GH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. The analysis of the results encompassed 3 similar periods: before the infusion (afternoon hours) the first (evening hours) and the second (night hours) halves of the treatment. The night plasma concentration of melatonin in genistein-infused rams was significantly lower than that noted during the respective period in vehicle-infused rams. Plasma GH concentration increased significantly in both vehicle- and genistein-infused rams during the night hours, as compared with the concentrations noted during the afternoon and evening, however, genistein significantly stimulated the amplitude of GH pulses in these latter. The LH concentration was significantly lower during the second part of genistein treatment, than in vehicle-infused rams. The frequency and amplitude of LH pulses clearly tended to decrease following genistein infusion. In conclusion, genistein, acting at the central nervous system level in sexually active rams is able to reduce the secretion of melatonin and LH and has also a slight stimulatory effect on the amplitude of GH pulses.",

In this work, the effects of interferon beta (IFNbeta) and glatiramer acetate (GA) on SC cultures were tested, with interest on the growth curve and potential proliferative effects. Primary cultures were prepared from the sciatic nerves of neonatal rats and seeded onto culture plates. Such cells were then subjected to treatment with different doses of IFN beta (100, 500 and 1000 IU/ml) and of GA (1.2, 2.5 and 5.0 mmg/ml) for five consecutive days. S100beta and DAPI double labeling was used in order to confirm the purity of the cultures. Both treatment with IFN and GA resulted in an increased number of cultured SCs. However, only IFN beta induced a statistically significant proliferative outcome. Such results indicate that addition of IFN beta to the culture medium is efficient in order to improve SC proliferation in vitro.",

Commonly, the chicks are used as subjects in several different learning tests, including one trial learning tests. However, for adult laying hens no such one trial learning tests have been established. In particular, there is no test established which focuses on the role of the hippocampus, a brain region, which is often critically involved in learning and memory consolidation. In this study we investigated the inhibitory effects of intra-hippocampal D-AP5 injections on a specific one trial passive avoidance learning test in adult laying hens (Gallus gallus domesticus). We used a step down avoidance learning paradigm (SDA) which is frequently used in rodents. Intra-hippocampal injections of D-AP5 impaired the learning abilities of adult laying hens compared to sham-injected control subjects. Thus, the experiments revealed that the hippocampus is critically involved in learning the inhibitory SDA task. Our results further indicate that the step down avoidance paradigm is suitable to examine learning and memory processes in adult laying hens.",

    "abstract": "Recent physiological studies indicate that weightlessness reliably alters ocular structure and function, as well as the ability to process visual‑spatial information. The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) are two key brain areas implicated in the processing of visual‑spatial information. Here, we used the modified tail‑suspension rat model to simulate the physiological effects of microgravity. Rats were divided into four groups, which exposed to the simulated microgravity environment for 0 (Control group), 7, 14, or 28 days. We found a significant increase in cellular apoptosis in the PPC and the LGN after 7 days of simulated microgravity. In addition, there was an increase in expression of c‑Fos protein in the PPC, and a repression of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in the LGN after 7 days. Based on these results, we conclude that short‑term simulated microgravity may induce cell apoptosis in the PPC and LGN, and reflect a neural adaptive process to accommodate a microgravity environment.",

The effects of an intravenous injection of serotonin at a dose of 0.05 mg per kg of body weight were studied in eighteen anaesthetized cats, breathing spontaneously via a tracheal cannula. In eleven cats the larynx was isolated in situ to measure laryngeal resistance. In post-serotonin apnoea, the expiratory laryngeal resistance rose four-fold. This coincided with the increased afferent activity of the superior laryngeal nerve. In the initial phase of resumed shallow breathing, the increase in the expiratory laryngeal resistance was coupled with reduced tidal volume. Bilateral section of the superior laryngeal nerve failed to affect laryngeal constriction and the ventilatory response to serotonin. Thus laryngeal afferents running within the superior laryngeal nerve are not essential for the respiratory phenomena induced by serotonin.",

All groups were divided into two subgroups according to warning signal sequences. In the first subgroup (D-DN-N sequence) the subjects were initially trained with the visual CS (darkness - D), then transferred to the more salient visual and auditory compound CS (darkness and noise - DN), and finally to the auditory CS alone (noise - N). The opposite arrangement of the CSs (N-ND-D sequence) was employed in the second subgroup. A small interference with shuttle-box learning, and no transfer deficit were seen in Group LAT, whereas D- LAT rats showed dramatically slow and inconsistent acquisition of avoidance responding followed by rapid weakening of performance during the training. In contrast to controls, in both lesioned groups avoidance and intertrial responding (ITR) were independent of the CS modality changes. The results indicate differential involvement of the lateral, and also of the dorsolateral amygdala, and amygdalostriatal transition area in CS processing, as well as in the mechanisms related to consolidation of the associations created during avoidance training.",

Removal of baroreceptor influences from cervical sympathetic and splanchnic spectra using partialization shows that 3-6 Hz peaks are due to baroreceptors since coherence decreased in > 19 days old while remaining unchanged in < 2 weeks old piglets. The 8-12 Hz band (present in normal coherence after 21 days) was revealed in piglets < 14 days old after removal of respiratory modulation by partialization; similarly increased coherence was also observed in the 16-18 Hz band through 3 weeks. Thus, use of partial power and coherency is a useful tool for unmasking the complex relationship found in developing SYMP outflows. These results suggest that there is a period of reorganization within the SYMP rhythm generating circuits, which may be essential for normal development.",

Thereafter, a single dose of either 5, 50 or 500 units (U) of recombinant rat interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) was injected into the lesion cavity. One or 2 days after the injury, the rats were injected with 3H-thymidine. Brain sections were subjected to BSI-B4 lectin histochemistry and autoradiography to visualise proliferating and non-proliferating macrophages located within the region of injury. A mitogenic effect of IL-1 beta on macrophages was observed on day 2 in brains injected with the lowest 5 U dose of cytokine. Following administration of higher 50 U and 500 U doses, infiltration of the injured tissue by macrophages was significantly intensified on day 1. However, on day 2, dose-dependent reductions of the total number of macrophages as well as their proliferative activity were recorded. The findings suggest that the higher the initial quantity of macrophages, the sooner they disappeared from the injury site. It may therefore be hypothesised that IL-1 beta-induced increase in macrophage recruitment at the beginning of the inflammatory response speeded the removal of tissue debris and, therefore, accelerated healing of the injured nervous tissue.",

The aim of the study was to assess sympathetic nervous system function in OSAS, to compare the results with those found in non-apneic heavy snorers, to define the pattern of abnormalities and to study the correlations between SSR results and polysomnographic parameters. In the OSAS group the mean hand latency was significantly longer than in non-apneic snorers and healthy subjects. The most characteristic pattern of abnormalities was an absence of a foot response found in 12 of 15 OSAS patients. There were no correlations between SSR abnormalities and polysomnographic parameters.

    "abstract": "The ewe shows a marked seasonal variation in the effects of ovarian steroids on pulsatile GnRH secretion. In the breeding season, progesterone inhibits GnRH pulse frequency, while estradiol suppresses pulse amplitude. In anestrus, both steroids inhibit pulse frequency. The effects of progesterone in both seasons are mediated by endogenous opioid peptides (EOP) that act in the preoptic area (POA) and medial basal hypothalamus (MBH). However, knife cut studies indicate that actions in the MBH are most important. Moreover, blockade of EOP receptors activates (e.g., induces Fos) GnRH perikarya in the MBH, but not those in the POA. Thus interactions between EOP and GnRH neurons within the MBH may be critical for progesterone negative feedback. The neural systems mediating estradiol suppression of GnRH pulse amplitude in the breeding season are largely unknown, although alpha-adrenergic neurons may be involved. The seasonal variation in inhibition of GnRH pulse frequency by estradiol is postulated to be mediated by a group of dopaminergic (DA) neurons that have three important properties: (1) they inhibit GnRH pulse frequency; (2) their activity is stimulated by estradiol; and (3) they are functional in anestrus, but not the breeding season. Recent work examining the effects of lesions of DA neurons and the ability of estradiol to induce Fos in DA cells strongly suggests that DA neurons in the retrochiasmatic area (A15) and POA (A14) have all three characteristics. We thus propose that these DA neurons are responsible for the seasonal variation in the ability of estradiol to inhibit GnRH pulse frequency.",

The studies of brain mechanisms responsible for visual recognition memory suggest that the modulation of single unit activity in the inferotemporal and perirhinal cortices could be an important part of the neuronal substrate of recognition memory. In this review, I will describe Stimulus Specific Adaptation (SSA) - the reduction in neuronal response to previously viewed objects. The experimental tasks in which SSA is observed will be presented, along with the possibility that SSA may be enhanced by saccadic exploration of visual scene. Next, I will demonstrate that under special circumstances (partially split-brain preparation) monkeys could recognize the re-presentation of visual images without the concomitant appearance of SSA. The most promising alternative candidate for neuronal mechanism involved in recognition memory is delay activity - an increased frequency of cell firing in the time between the initial presentation of an image and its subsequent re-presentation. In order to determine if delay activity is important for recognition we have started to investigate the effects on recognition memory of disrupting delay activity by electrical stimulation. Preliminary results indicate a positive correlation between a reduction in delay activity and a decrease in recognition performance.",

Sequences of randomly intermixed frequent (non-target) and rare (target) stimuli were presented. In visual experiments, these were flashes of light of two different colors. In auditory tests there were two tones of different frequencies. The instruction was to keep a mental count of each target stimulus. To study the alterations of the \"state of the brain\" produced by target detection, responses to non-targets immediately following targets were compared with responses to an eighth subsequent non-target stimulus. To evaluate the effect of such \"brain states\" on responses to stimuli of a different modality, additional visual stimuli (probes) were delivered after both auditory and visual \"oddball\" stimuli. It was found that responses to the eighth presentation of non-target stimulus were preceded by significant negative shift of recorded potential. This shift was smaller before the responses to non-targets immediately following the presentation of target stimuli. The difference was significant both in auditory and visual tests. Responses to \"oddball\" stimuli were little affected: only the reduction of P200 peaks in \"after target\" responses was significant in visual tests. Responses to probes showed stronger effects: when visual probes followed visual \"oddball\" stimuli, all three components measured (N100, P130 and P200) were shifted positively in responses to eighth presentations of non-targets. When visual probes were presented in auditory tests, only the amplitude of the N100 component was significantly affected.",

    "abstract": "Hyperpolarization‑activated and cyclic nucleotide‑gated (HCN) channels are well expressed in the vertebrate retina. Their role in formation of electroretinographic (ERG) responses to stimulus onset (b‑wave) and stimulus offset (d‑wave) are largely unknown. In this study we investigated the effects of pharmacological blockade of HCN channels (with ZD7288 or ivabradine) on the ERG b‑ and d‑waves in dark adapted frog eyecup preparations. Initially, the dose‑response relationship of ZD7288 effects on the b‑ and d‑waves was investigated. Afterwards, the effects of 75 μM ZD7288 on the stimulus ‑ response function of the ERG b‑ and d‑waves were explored over a wide intensity range (10 log units). Finally, the effects of 30 μM ivabradine on the same function were studied. Perfusion with 75 μM ZD7288 did not change the absolute and relative sensitivity of the ERG ON and OFF responses. It caused an enhancement of the d‑wave amplitude at all suprathreshold stimulus intensities, while the b‑wave amplitude was slightly enhanced only in the range of higher intensities. As a result of the greater blocker effect on the OFF response amplitude, the b/d amplitude ratio was significantly decreased over the whole intensity range. ZD7288 caused a prolongation of the b‑wave half‑width duration, but a shortening of the d‑wave half‑width duration at higher intensities. Similar results were obtained when 30 μM ivabradine was used for HCN channel blockade. Our results clearly demonstrate that the blockade of retinal HCN channels changes the balance between the ON and OFF responses in the distal frog retina. This ON/OFF imbalance may be one of the causes for visual disturbances reported in ivabradine treated patients.",

Within one hour, R‑837 induced activation of the nucleus of the solitary tract, as well as a small increase in nasal IL‑6, but otherwise in the absence of an overt inflammatory response. It is tempting to speculate that it might be a direct interaction of R‑837 with trigeminal neurons in order to alert the central nervous system of invading pathogens.",

Twenty‑eight male WAG/Rij rats were randomly divided into four groups: group I: control; group II: Madopar 5 mg/kg; group III: Madopar 50 mg/kg; group IV: Madopar 100 mg/kg. A tripolar electrode was attached to all WAG/Rij rats. Electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings were made before and after Madopar (5, 50, and 100 mg/kg) injection for three hours. Anxiety‑related behavior was studied using the open field test for 5 min after the ECoG recordings. Madopar significantly reduced the number and duration of spike‑wave discharges (SWDs) when compared to the control group. The highest dose of Madopar (100 mg/kg) significantly reduced the duration of SWDs when compared to Madopar (5 mg/kg). All Madopar doses did not alter the duration of grooming, but the highest doses of Madopar significantly increased the number of squares crossed in the open field test when compared to the control and Madopar (5 mg/kg) groups. These results revealed that Madopar reduced the absence‑like seizures and the anxiety‑related behavior in WAG/Rij rats. This may emphasize the therapeutic properties of the Madopar/L‑dopa in absence epilepsy.",

By integrating two independent data sets obtained from miRNA‑seq and mRNA‑seq respectively, this study aims to profile the network of miRNA and potential target genes, as well as relevant events occurring in the dentate gyrus of isoflurane exposed 7‑day‑old mice. We found that a single four hours exposure to isoflurane yielded 1059 pairs of differently expressed miRNAs/target genes in the dentate gyrus. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis further indicates that dysregulated miRNAs/target genes have far‑reaching effects on the cellular pathophysiological events, such as cell apoptosis, axon development, and synaptic transmission. Our results would greatly broaden our functional understanding of the role of miRNA/target gene in the context of anesthetics‑induced neurotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "The study aimed to investigate the significance of serum biomarkers in the severity grading of traumatic brain injury (TBI). For this purpose, mice underwent fluid percussion injury (FPI) at three discrete severity levels, mild, moderate, and severe. The severity of trauma was verified by the qualitative and quantitative histopathology of the brain. The serum samples were analyzed for the potential changes in ubiquitin C‑terminal hydrolase‑1 (UCHL‑1), S100β, interleukin‑6 (IL‑6), corticosterone, and β‑endorphin at 24 and 72 h post injury. A multifold increase in the values of UCHL‑1 was reported at all severity extents of FPI. However, TBI severity‑dependent increase in UCHL‑1 was reported on 72 h following FPI but not at 24 h. S100β values were significantly augmented in the mild and moderate group at both the time point but not in the severe group. Serum level of IL‑6 was significantly increased in the mild injury group at 24 h but not in the moderate and severe. At 72 h, IL‑6 showed a reverse trend. β‑endorphin and corticosterone were sensitive at an early stage only. Such unique dynamics of each biomarker enable us to propose TBI severity scale in the term of biomarkers codes to predict the extent of neurotrauma. Our preclinical study presents a predictive model for further clinical validation.",

Functional analysis and protein interaction analysis of DEG hubs were performed, and the miRNA‑transcription factor (TF)‑target network was built. In addition, the candidate small-molecule compounds that might reverse the expression of an ICH‑linked gene were identified by CMap. This method revealed a total of 408 DEGs. Five modules including chemokinerelated, antigen immune-related, pathogen infection, cell reaction, and positive regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation and MAPK cascade were identified. The expression levels of CCL5, CXCL8, ICAM1, IL-1B, IL-6, VCAM1, and VEGFA were correlated with ICH among the top 10 hub genes obtained in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. A total of 237 miRNA‑TF‑target regulatory relationships were obtained, including 6 TFs, 11 miRNAs and 105 target genes. Finally, the CMap database identified Prestwick-1083, xamoterol, ifosfamide, methyldopate, nifurtimox, propranolol, and methoxamine as potential therapeutic agents for ICH while doxorubicin, menadione and azacitidine may increase its pathogenicity. Furthermore, CCL5, CXCL8 and VEGFA may be novel candidate susceptibility genes for ICH. Some small-molecule drugs, including xamoterol may be used for the treatment of ICH.",

LACC1 promoted inflammation and aggravated cognitive impairment in a mouse model of stroke. In an in vitro model of stroke, inhibition of LACC1 reduced inflammation and ROS‑induced oxidative stress by activating AMP‑activated protein kinase (AMPK) expression and suppressing NLPR3 expression. Furthermore, our studies revealed that inhibition of AMPK activity reduced the effects of si‑LACC1 on cognitive disorder in mice after stroke via the AMPK/NLPR3 pathway. AMPK activation also reduced the effects of LACC1 on inflammation and ROS‑induced oxidative stress via the NLPR3 pathway in the in vitro model that we evaluated. Our study suggests that LACC1‑aggravated inflammation causes cognitive impairment after stroke via the AMPK/NLRP3 pathway, which may provide a new therapeutic target for stroke and other neurological diseases and their associated complications. In sum, we identified an important role and regulatory mechanism for LACC1 in maintaining stroke‑induced cognitive disorder via the AMPK/NLRP3 pathway.",

The support vector machine (SVM) was used to constructed classifier, which was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves. The E‑TABM‑421 was used to verify the DEGs related to immunity and the classifier. Seven types of immune cells with significant differences were screened, such as activated CD8 T cell and center memory CD4 T cell. We then obtained 408 DEGs related to immune cell. Subsequently, 10 overlapped KEGG pathways related to the DEGs were obtained, such as hematopoietic cell lineage, NOD‑like receptor signaling pathway and T cell receptor signaling pathway. Finally, 9 DEGs related to immune cells (CCL5, CD27, CD3D, CREB5, FYN, ITPR3, TAB1, NCR3 and S1PR5) were screened to constructed SVM classifier. The area under the curve was 0.865 in training dataset and the AUC was 0.75 in the validation set.

Three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) images were obtained from fixed brains of male homogenous grt/grt (n=5) and heterozygous grt/+ (n=5) mice at 15 weeks of age, and volumes of representative cerebral regions were calculated on the basis of those images. Following CT measurements, cryosections of the brain were made, and immunohistochemistry for NeuN and SMI-32 was carried out. By CT-based volumetry, region-specific reductions in volumes were marked in the cerebral cortex and white matter, but not in other cerebral regions of grt/grt. When quantitatively evaluating the shape of the cerebral cortex, the frontooccipital length of the cortex was significantly smaller in grt/grt than in grt/+, whereas the cortical width was not altered in grt/grt. On the other hand, both cortical thickness and density of NeuN-immunopositive neurons in three distinctive cortical regions, i.e., the primary motor cortex, barrel field of primary somatosensory cortex and primary visual cortex, were not different between grt/grt and grt/+. By semi-quantitative immunohistochemical analysis, the intensity of SMI-32 immunostaining was significantly weaker in grt/grt than in grt/+ in the three cortical areas examined. SMI-32 staining was reduced, particularly in layer III pyramidal neurons in grt/grt, while it was sustained in multipolar neurons. The present results suggest that cerebral abnormalities in grt/grt mice are characterized by cortical hypoplasia at the frontooccipital axis with immature pyramidal neurons and insufficient development of callosal fibers.",

On the 30th and 90th days after ICH, highly significant decreases in the conduction velocity by 62% and 60%, respectively in comparison with the control group of animals were observed. The data of morphometric analysis demonstrated significant decreases in the mean diameter and density of myelinated fibres at all examined terms after ICH. A number of the myelin sheaths were swollen and lost their regular laminations. Axoplasmic and myelin degenerations were the most frequent events in these nerve fibres; reductions of the diameter of the axis cylinders were also observed. In the contralateral nerve (related to the hemisphere with ICH), negative changes were greater, while the ipsilateral nerve was also subjected to those. Our data demonstrate that the consequences of unilateral ICH in the capsula interna induce bilateral negative changes in the peripheral nervous system of rats.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders (NDD) are chronic neurological diseases characterized by loss and/or damage to neurons along with the myelin sheath, and patients are at higher risk of severe infection with the SARS‑CoV‑2. A comprehensive literature search was performed using relevant terms and inclusion‑exclusion criteria. Recent articles, subjects older than 50 years, and articles written in the English language were included, whereas letters to the editor and articles related to pregnant women were excluded from the review study. COVID‑19 appears to damage angiotensin‑II receptors which cause natural killer cells to lose the ability to clear virus‑infected cells, owing to worse outcomes in patients with NDD. COVID‑19 can worsen the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. In addition, COVID‑19 worsens drug‑responsive motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) and other symptoms like fatigue and urinary complaints. Vitamin D is essential in decreasing pro‑inflammatory and increasing anti‑inflammatory cytokines in ongoing COVID‑19 infections and reducing angiotensin receptors and, hence, decreasing COVID‑19 infection severity. Telemedicine shows promise for patients with NDD but is yet to overcome legal issues and personal barriers. COVID‑19 has a significant effect on neurodegenerative conditions, which appears partly to the nature of the NDD and the neuro‑invasive capabilities of the SARS‑CoV‑2. The protective role of vitamin D in patients with NDD further supports this hypothesis. Modifications in current health care, like the telemedicine platform, are required to address the increased risk of serious infection in this population. Further studies will be required to clarify conflicting reports in many fields.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) is an unprecedented global health concern that was declared a pandemic in March 2020. Although primarily recognized by respiratory symptoms, growing evidence suggested the causal relationship between the infection with the disease agent, namely severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2), and neurological manifestations. Given that the virus‑induced neurological involvement is associated with a poorer prognosis, persistent neurological sequelae, and a more severe form of the disease, efforts have been made to introduce a biomarker to recognize neurological abnormalities early in the course of the disease. Studies indicate a significantly higher concentration of neurofilament light chain (NFL) in cerebrospinal fluid or blood of COVID‑19 patients versus adjusted controls. It has also been reported that COVID‑19 patients suffering from the severe form of the disease had higher NFL levels than patients with mild to moderate forms. Moreover, elevated NFL levels at hospital admission in patients who did not present primarily with neurological expressions could predict the emergence of neurological symptoms during the hospital stay. The early recognition of neurological abnormalities using the NFL biomarker could lead to escalated medical care limiting the progression of SARS‑CoV‑2‑induced central nervous system pathogenesis, resulting in a significant amelioration in disease outcome. Nevertheless, NFL assessment integrated with the evaluation of other neurodegenerative biomarkers and factors indicating disease prognosis could provide a more comprehensive estimate of disease prognosis and the extent of neurological involvement.",

Various drug compounds are used to enhance DA levels for therapeutic purposes. Understanding neural signaling and movement patterns associated with over‑ and under‑stimulation of the DA system is essential. This study investigated striatal local field potential (LFP) oscillation and locomotor activity following treatments with morphine, a DA release enhancer, and haloperidol (HAL), a DA D2 receptor (D2R) antagonist in mice. After intracranial electrodes were placed into the dorsal striatum of male Swiss albino ICR mice, intraperitoneal injections of morphine or HAL were administered. LFP signals and spontaneous motor activity were recorded simultaneously. The results showed that morphine significantly increased locomotor speed, both low (30.3-44.9 Hz) and high (60.5-95.7 Hz) LFP gamma powers and delta (1-4 Hz)‑gamma (30.3-95.7 Hz) phase‑amplitude coupling. In contrast, HAL treatments were found to significantly decrease these parameters. Moreover, regression analyses also revealed significant positive correlations between locomotor speed and high gamma powers. Taken together, these results demonstrate opposite LFP oscillations in the dorsal striatum with low and high gamma activities, and delta‑gamma couplings in response to a DA release enhancer and D2R antagonist by morphine and HAL, respectively. These parameters reflect fluctuation of neuronal activity in the dorsal striatum that might be useful for pathological research and drug discovery for PD.",

It has been related that enriched environment (EE) induces experience‑dependent plasticity mechanisms, improving the performance of the animals in learning and memory tests. This study evaluated the effects of EE on histological parameters of the cerebellum in rats that received intracerebroventricular streptozotocin. In the standard environment, streptozotocin (STZ) promoted a significant increase between the gaps in the Purkinje layer of approximately 20%. On the other hand, in an enriched environment, the control result (EE) was similar to the result under streptozotocin effect (STZEE). In the standard environment (SE) group a 26% significant reduction in Purkinje cell density was observed under STZ presence. By analyzing the results of the density of Purkinje cells under the effect of streptozotocin in a standard environment (STZSE) against the density of the layer of Purkinje cells also under the effect of streptozotocin in an enriched environment (STZEE), a significant reduction of approximately 76% in density was observed of Purkinje cells in standard environment (STZSE), the mean number of Purkinje cells in enriched environments was not reduced, despite of STZ. According to the results, treatment with STZ and exposure to EE did not change the cerebellum general morphology/cytoarchitecture, hence was no significant difference in the layers thickness. These facts demonstrate that the enriched environment appears to protect the Purkinje cells layer of cerebellum from possible degeneration.",

In the present study, the effect of nesfatin‑1, a neuropeptide, was investigated on penicillin‑induced epilepsy model. Epileptiform activity was induced by an injection of penicillin into the somatomotor cortex at 56 albino Wistar rats. Nesfatin‑1 (i.c.v.) was administered at five different doses (12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 pmol) 30 min after a penicillin administration. Astressin 2B, a corticotropin‑releasing factor (CRF) receptor antagonist, was administered 10 minutes later the effective dose of nesfatin‑1 (50 pmol, i.c.v.). Superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in cerebrum were analysed by ELISA method. Nesfatin‑1, at the doses of 25, 50 and 100 pmol, significantly reduced the frequency of epileptiform activity. However, none of the doses of nesfatin‑1 had any effect on the amplitude of epileptiform activity. Astressin 2B alone did not show any effect on epileptiform activity. In addition, astressin 2B had no effect on the anticonvulsant effect of nesfatin‑1. Nesfatin‑1 (at the doses of 25, 50, 100 pmol) did not alter SOD and GSH levels, but significantly increased the GPx and GR levels. Nesfatin‑1 (at a dose of 50 pmol) significantly decreased the MDA level in the cerebrum. Nesfatin‑1 shows anticonvulsant effect and astressin 2B did not affect the anticonvulsant effect of nesfatin‑1. We suggest that nesfatin‑1 has oxidative stress‑mediated anticonvulsant effect in the penicillin‑induced epileptic activity.",

International literature strongly correlates sufficient VD levels with comprehensive mental well‑being in women. This link is intricately related to neurobiological pathways and hormonal fluctuations, where low VD levels are notably associated with depression. This study comprehensively explores the neurobiological mechanisms that link VD and altered mood in women. Considering the increased susceptibility to hormonal shifts in women, our research investigates the intricate interplay between VD's neurobiology and mood regulation. Through the focused analysis of specific studies, we untangle the complex web of connections between VD and mood changes in women. Our approach takes into account the dynamic nature of hormonal changes, deepening our understanding of these mechanisms. Our study underscores VD's significant role as a neurosteroid micronutrient, especially in women's health. By examining the intricate relationships between VD's neurobiology and hormones, we propose strategies to improve mood regulation and psychological well‑being in women. In addition, we recommend targeted measures to achieve optimal VD levels, helping to manage challenges arising from hormonal fluctuations. The present review highlights the multifaceted contribution of VD to women's health, particularly in mood regulation. Through the analysis of the interplay of neurobiology, hormones and VD, our study provides avenues for enhancing women's mental and emotional well‑being through customized interventions.",

    "abstract": "This study explored the protective effect and mechanism of hydrogen‑rich saline (HRS) on the neurological function of mice with cerebral ischemia. Effects of HRS on neurological function in mice with cerebral ischemia were evaluated by neurological function scores. Infarct volume and histological damage were evaluated by 2,3,5‑triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining (TTC staining). Golgi‑Cox staining was conducted to measure the morphological changes of neuronal dendrites and dendritic spines. The expression of neuronal markers was detected by immunofluorescence. Western blot was used to detect protein expression. The infarct volume of mice in the HRS‑H group decreased significantly compared to that of the distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) group. Mice in the HRS‑H group had a lower neurological deficit score than that in the dMCAO group. Compared to the dMCAO group, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the level of glutathione (GSH) significantly increased in the HRS‑H group. Compared with the dMCAO group, the number of apoptotic cells in the HRS‑H group decreased. Administration of HRS was shown to be able to decrease cavitation of the brain cortex after ischemia. The spine density in the HRS‑H group increased compared to that of the dMCAO group. In the in vitro experiment, compared with the oxygen‑glucose deprivation (OGD) group, the active oxygen content in the 75% HRM group decreased, and the mitochondrial membrane potential and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content increased. Compared with the OGD group, the ratio of P‑AMPK and the levels of LC3II/LC3I in the hydrogen‑rich medium (HRM) group was upregulated, and P‑mTOR levels and P62 levels in the HRM group were down‑regulated. HRS can enhance neuroplasticity after ischemia and promote neurological recovery in mice with cerebral ischemia, which may involve the autophagy pathway mediated by the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway.",

The aim of the study was to assess the influence of duration of zolpidem treatment and its withdrawal, as well as the role of alpha1-containing GABAA receptors in the development of physical dependence and tolerance. Namely, recombinant receptors can be used to characterize mechanisms involved in different processes in the brain and to delineate the contribution of specific receptor subtypes. To address the influence of chronic zolpidem treatment we exposed HEK293 cells stably expressing alpha1beta2gamma2S recombinant GABAA receptors for seven consecutive days, while withdrawal periods lasted for 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours. Using radioligand binding studies we determined that chronic zolpidem treatment did not induce changes in either GABAA receptor number or in the expression of subunit mRNAs. We observed the enhancement of binding sites and upregulated expression of subunit mRNAs only following 96-hour withdrawal. Moreover, zolpidem treatment and its withdrawal (All time points) induced functional uncoupling between GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites in the GABAA receptor complex. Accordingly, it might be assumed that zolpidem withdrawal-induced uncoupling of GABAA receptors is associated with altered GABAA receptor subunit mRNA expression. The results presented here provide an insight into molecular and cellular mechanisms probably underlying adaptive changes of GABAA receptor function in response to chronic usage and withdrawal of zolpidem and perhaps the observed molecular changes could be linked to the tolerance and dependence produced upon prolonged treatment with other GABAergic drugs.",

Non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used anti‑inflammatory analgesic agents representing 7.7% of worldwide prescriptions of which 90% are in patients over 65 years old. Based on mixed findings a systematic review and meta‑analysis were conducted to develop a better understanding of the protective role of NSAIDs in AD. We used three database PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase to identify the literatures. The studies following cohort and case‑control design were investigated separately to check the effect of NSAIDs on AD, by the using their fundamental indicators (relative risk and odds ratio). The fixed effect or random effects model were used to estimate the pooled relative risk and pooled odds ratio separately for both the study design, based on magnitude of heterogeneity. A total of 14 studies were selected for meta‑analysis. Eight studies were following cohort study design, whereas, six studies were following case‑control study design. In meta‑analysis of cohort studies, the pooled relative risk was 0.67 with 95% C.I 0.39 to 1.15, which was statistically insignificant. In meta‑analysis of case‑control studies, the pooled odds ratio was 0.71 with 95% C.I 0.46 to 1.10, which was statistically insignificant. NSAIDs do not act as a protective factor for Alzheimer’s disease. Additionally, methodologically sound randomized controlled trials are required to produce a robust result.",

    "abstract": "In laboratory rats an epileptic-like spontaneous neocortical activity in the form of bursts of spike and wave discharges (SWD) develops gradually with age. High incidence of the SWD episodes is accompanied by other indices characteristic of advanced age: memory disturbances and atrophic changes within basal forebrain structures (Buzsaki et al. 1988b, Gage et al. 1988). Accordingly, it has been proposed that the number and duration of the SWD episodes be regarded as a diagnostic marker to distinguish between young and old brains (Buzsaki et al. 1988a). It is suspected that exposure to neurotoxins may accelerate the progress of age-related neurodegeneration by predisposing neurons to premature death and thus hasten the appearance of the age-related functional deficits (Weiss 1990). Analysing the development of SWD activity in exposed rats may be helpful for an assessment of the potency of the neurotoxin under study to exert such an effect. In the present work the influence of a three-month exposure to a model neurotoxin, ethanol (ETOH), on the development of the SWD activity in imp-DAK rats was investigated. It has been found that in rats given 10% ETOH solution as the only drink for three months, the incidence of the SWD episodes increased markedly. The increase was most clearly seen after ETOH withdrawal and on the 90th day after exposure no tendency to decline could be observed. The obtained data indicate that exposure to exogenous substances may exert a distinguishable long-lasting influence on the development of the SWD activity.",

Now the best accuracy was found when the bars were at an angle of 45 degrees or 135 degrees to the length-axis of the body. This means that the oblique effect in the somatic sensory system is of vestibular origin.",

    "abstract": "Previous reports on conditioning P300 amplitude indicated that downtraining produced a stronger effect than uptraining. This asymmetry can be due to the effect of drain on processing resources of the brain produced by the attempts to use feedback information (parallel task effect). Such a drain should reduce P300 amplitude regardless of the direction of training. The aim of the experiment was to demonstrate this effect. Event-related potentials (ERPs) evoked by light stimuli in a standard odd-ball procedure were recorded from Fz, Cz and Pz scalp sites. Subjects were instructed to enlarge or to reduce the P300 amplitude. The first 30 presentations of the target stimulus were analyzed during which the effect of learning should be negligible and processing of feedback information should be intensive. ERPs recorded during uptraining and downtraining were compared with the no-feedback recordings. As predicted, downtraining significantly reduced the P300 amplitude even in the first session of learning. Unexpectedly, uptraining recordings did not differ from no-feedback ERPs but differed significantly from downtraining waves. Such results support the prediction that feedback procedures involve a number of processes that alter the P300 amplitude even before the effects of learning can be expected. But if the hypothesis of the parallel task is to be accepted there must be another instantaneous process that compensates for P300 amplitude reduction during uptraining.",

Recent investigations have provided evidences that inhibition of NO synthesis attenuated the vasodilatation caused by AVP, and inhibited the improvement of learning and memory evoked by angiotensin II. AVP as well as pharmacologically produced increase in endogenous NO facilitates the consolidation of shock avoidance learning. We evaluated the behavioural effects of AVP at dose 1 micrograms after the inhibition of NOS by NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) at dose 10 micrograms, and after the injection of endogenous donor of NO-L-arginine- 10 micrograms in the retrieval of passive avoidance situation, and in consolidation of active avoidance responses. The locomotor activity of all investigated drugs was tested in the open field test. AVP facilitated the recall of passive avoidance responses and consolidation of active avoidance responses. Neither the increase of NO concentration after the injection of L-arginine nor the decrease of NO after the inhibition of NOS by L-NAME changed the behavioural effects of AVP. L-arginine increased the psychomotor behaviour and L-NAME decreased the activity of animals in the \"open field\" test. L-arginine itself improved the consolidation of active avoidance responses. Our results indicate that central action of AVP is probably independent of NO concentration in the brain.",

Three months later, the effects of partial denervation of the fast extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle on the activity of its remaining motor units were studied using electromyographic (EMG) recordings in freely moving animals. In spite of a reduced number of motor units the amount of aggregate EMG activity was greater in the partially denervated EDL muscle in all experimental conditions. This increase was more obvious at rest than during exploratory behaviour, and was significantly greater in muscles that were partially denervated at 3 days than at 18 days of age. On the other hand, the effect of partial denervation on the EMG activity pattern during locomotion was similar in animals partially denervated at 3 or 18 days of age. Unlike in intact EDL, in the partially denervated EDL muscle the duration of the bursts was influenced by the step cycle duration. Thus, we conclude that although partial denervation of EDL muscle influences the amount and pattern of activity of the remaining undamaged motor units in all animals, some of the alterations of EMG activity were more pronounced in animals denervated at younger age.",

From birth to the 4th day of postnatal life most GFAP-positive cells in the paraclaustral reservoir are similar to transitional astroglia. From the end of the first postnatal week they have the morphology of mature astrocytes, although during the next week, their density was a slightly higher than in neighboring structures. On the 21st day, the morphology and density of astroglial cells in the ventral part of the external capsule did not differ from the surrounding regions. ED1/OX-42- positive microglial cells present in the paraclaustral reservoir during the first postnatal week represented ameboid microglia; their density was clearly higher than in the neighboring structures. During the second week they began to transform into ramified microglia and from the 21st day on, only OX-42 positive resting microglial cells were observed in the ventral part of the external capsule. We suggest that the paraclaustral reservoir is a place of accumulation of astroglia and microglia during brain development and may possibly serve as source of glial cells for neighboring structures. Alternatively, these glial populations may perform local developmental functions.",

Quantitative descriptors of those configurations (Lehmann 1987) were referred to the CAT data. In patients: (1) segments III-V were delayed, (2) in the non-target condition, diminished global field power (GFP) emerged, coexisting either with lower amplitude of posterior potentials in segment I and II or with lower amplitude of a central positive potential in segment V, (3) an altered topographic pattern of responses to the target stimulus occurred. In healthy subjects detection of the target (as compared to the non-target condition) was associated with a shift of the location of the positive potential in segments IV and V from a central towards the prefrontal area. In patients, in segment V a similar shift reached frontal, but not prefrontal areas, and additionally, the central areas remained active. Delayed latency and low GFP in segment V in the non-target condition in patients correlated with poor CAT performance. A more posterior location of the positive centroid in segment V during detection of the target correlated with better CAT results, and the associated GFP increase with less prolonged reaction time. The data revealed a possible compensatory role of central and frontal areas in the face of weakened prefrontal functions in schizophrenia.",

The present study was aimed to analyze a possible anatomical substrate of the LH hyposomnia within the hypothalamus. In a group of electrolytically lesioned LH rats the intensity of sleep disturbances, assessed on the basis of EEG records from the neocortex and the hippocampus, was confronted with the localization and the extent of destruction of the LH area and with the topography of known fiber systems of the medical forebrain bundle (MFB). In separate experiments the effects of the destruction of LH cell bodies by means of bilateral ibotenic acid (IBO) injections and inhibition of LH neuronal elements by bilateral muscimol (MUSC) administration were also tested. It was found that pronounced hyposomnia follows electrolytic but not IBO lesions of the LH/MFB area. The effective LH damage might have been localized at every level of its antero-posterior axis, from the preoptic area up to the posterior hypothalamus, suggesting involvement of fiber system(s) rather than a localized group of neuronal pericaria. The most effective lesions transsected projections descending from the preoptic/anterior hypothalamic area, olfactory structures, ventral striatum and the central amygdaloid nucleus as well as fibers connecting LH with the brainstem reticular formation, many of them using GABA as a neurotransmitter. Bilateral MUSC injections caused a dose-dependent, bicuculline-reversible, increase in waking time, most pronounced at a dose of 50 ng, which ressembled the effect of the electrolytic lesion. These results indicate that LH hyposomnia is not attributable to the damage to the intrahypothalamic neurons and suggest the participation of GABA-ergic transmission in LH in waking-sleep regulation.",

The thinking of each evolved with the progress of neuroscientific knowledge throughout the world, and save for Pavlov, each encountered governmental opposition to their views. Among the clues largely overlooked in their examination of conditional reflexes was the fact that the animal appreciates not only its own appetitive state but its immersion in the experimental setting. The latter in itself must require considerable, ongoing neuronal activity to sustain it. There is also the question as to whether \"motivation\" is an essential feature for the formation of conditional connections; and in cases where it is seemingly absent, as in recognition memory, the processes that underlie the astonishing efficacy of such memory formation remain almost wholly obscure. Finally, it is remarked that the cerebral cortex, as initially supposed, may indeed be the governing locus, even of such simple effects as habituation.",

Our results indicated that after ischemia AIF is preferentially translocated from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm and to the nucleus. Intravenous administration of 3-AB (30 mg/kg b.w.) prevents AIF translocation to the nucleus. AIF was mainly seen in the structurally unchanged mitochondria and Golgi complex. Moreover, after 3-AB administration overexpression of Bcl-2 protein was observed in mitochondrial membranes, rough endoplasmatic reticulum, Golgi complex, nuclear envelopes, and also in cytoplasm and in nucleus. These data suggest that inhibition of PARP activity may have a beneficial effect on hippocampal neurons through overexpression of Bcl-2 protein and suppression of AIF translocation to the nucleus.",

    "abstract": "Claustrum is a telencephalic structure integrating information of various modalities. Proper functioning of this structure depends on the presence of a network of intrinsic connections. This includes GABA-ergic neuronal populations that also contain calcium-binding proteins (CaBPs). The goal of this study was to analyze qualitative and quantitative the 5-HTcontaining fibers in the rat claustrum and to assess the relationships between these fibers and the populations of claustral neurons expressing CaBPs. We used the methods of immunocytochemistry and morphometry. The serotonergic fibers in the claustrum are heterogeneous, both with respect to their morphology and spatial distribution. Thin varicose fibers are more numerous and are homogeneously distributed within the claustrum. Remaining fibers were thicker and possessed larger varicosities. They were present mainly in the ventral part of the claustrum. Although the serotonergic fibers are found in the vicinity of claustral cells containing CaBPs, direct contacts between these fibers and cells are rare. Other mechanisms, including volume transmission, may possibly mediate serotonergic influences.",

    "abstract": "Neurosteroids have long been known to act as important modulators of central nervous system functions. The concept of their mechanism of action, however, have essentially undergone an evolution. Previously, these compounds were postulated to regulate neuronal function mainly via allosteric regulation of some membrane-bound receptors, such as GABAA and NMDA receptors, in a non-genomic way. Recent studies have provided evidence for intracellular targets for neurosteroids, e.g., transcription factors (NFk-B, progesterone receptors), protein kinases (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, protein kinase C), or microtubule-associated proteins, i.e. factors essential in regulation of neuronal survival and apoptosis. This paper reviews in vitro and in vivo data on neurosteroid involvement in the regulation of neurodegenerative processes with emphasis on new intracellular and genomic mechanisms of their action. Potential utility of neurosteroids in the treatment of some neurodegenerative disorders has been also discussed. Correspondence should be addressed to W. Lason, Email: lason@if-pan.krakow.pl",

The intra-common carotid artery injection of NMDA (4 mg/kg) induced transient expiratory apnea followed by a brief and variably occurring period of breathing at reduced tidal volume. There were no consistent changes in respiratory rate in rats subjected to midcervical vagotomy alone. Supranodose vagotomy exerted no effect on NMDA-induced respiratory arrest, whereas CSNs' section or blockade of NMDA receptors with AP-7 abolished the apnea. These results indicate that the apnea induced by intra-arterial NMDA challenge is due to activation of peripheral NMDA receptors and is mediated via carotid body afferents.",

Variants confer to the homomeric or heteromeric channels distinct functional and/or pharmacological properties. Molecular biology, biochemical, and functional analysis by electrophysiological methods were used to identify and study a new variant of the P2X1 receptor named P2X1b. This new variant, identified in rat optic nerve, was also expressed in other tissues. P2X1b receptors lack amino acids 182 to 208 of native P2X1, a region that includes residues that are highly conserved among distinct P2X receptors. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, P2X1b was not functional as a homomer; however, when co-expressed with P2X1, it downregulated the electrical response generated by ATP compared with that of oocytes expressing P2X1 alone, and it seemed to form heteromeric channels with a modestly enhanced ATP potency. A decrease in responses to ATP in oocytes co-expressing different ratios of P2X1b to P2X1 was completely eliminated by overnight pretreatment with apyrase. Thus, it is suggested that P2X1b regulates, through a use-dependent mechanism, the availability, in the plasma membrane, of receptor channels that can be operated by ATP.",

    "abstract": "Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE) is one of the most recognized causes of neurological deficits in children. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) reductions, as seen with HIE, resulting in neuronal injury have not been evaluated in real-time. Photoacoustic Tomography (PAT) is a form of optical imaging which can detect cerebral hemodynamic alterations in a noninvasive, non-ionizing fashion via changes in hemoglobin optical absorption. Further, this technology has the potential to capture cerebral blood volume (CBV) fluctuations and perhaps CBF changes in real-time. We hypothesized that PAT can detect a reduction in cerebral hemoglobin optical absorption, and therefore CBF, in a neonatal model of hypoxia-ischemia. To investigate, P7 rats underwent right carotid artery ligation and exposure to 8 percent oxygen for 60 minutes while imaged with PAT every 20 minutes. Cerebral hemodynamic alterations, as measured by mean optical absorption (MOA), were calculated as a change from baseline. Global and regional MOA was analyzed using a linear mixed model. Global MOA was reduced within the right hemisphere as compared to the left during hypoxia. Regional differences in MOA were detected between the left and right sides for the middle and posterior cortical regions. Injury was confirmed using immunohistochemistry. We conclude that a reduction in global and regional MOA, and hence CBF, could be identified by PAT in a neonatal rat model of HIE. This is the first study described in the literature utilizing a neonatal rat model of HIE to demonstrate in vivo alterations in cerebral hemodynamics in a non-invasive and near real-time fashion.",

    "abstract": "Currently, there is no effective strategy for the treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI). A combination of biomaterials and stem cell therapy seems to be a promising approach to increase regenerative potential after SCI. We evaluated the use of a cellpolymer construct based on a combination of the conditionally immortalized spinal progenitor cell line SPC-01_GFP3, derived from human fetal spinal cord tissue, with a serotonin-modified poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) hydrogel (pHEMA-5HT). We compared the effect of treatment with a pHEMA-5HT hydrogel seeded with SPC-01_GFP3 cells, treatment with a pHEMA-5HT only and no treatment on functional outcome and tissue reconstruction in hemisected rats. Prior to transplantation the cell-polymer construct displayed a high potential to support the growth, proliferation and differentiation of SPC-01 cells in vitro. One month after surgery, combined hydrogel-cell treatment reduced astrogliosis and tissue atrophy and increased axonal and blood vessel ingrowth into the implant; however, two months later only the ingrowth of blood vessels remained increased. SPC-01_GFP3 cells survived well in vivo and expressed advanced markers of neuronal differentiation. However, a majority of the transplanted cells migrated out of the lesion and only rarely remained in the hydrogel. No differences among the groups in motor or sensory recovery were observed. Despite the support of the hydrogel as a cell carrier in vitro, and good results in vivo one month postsurgery, there was only a small effect on long term recovery, mainly due to the limited ability of the hydrogels to support the in vivo growth and differentiation of cells within the implant. Further modifications will be necessary to achieve stable long term improvement in functional outcome.",

The P50, which was recorded before and after stimulation, is sleep-state dependent and sensitive to states of arousal in clinical populations. We found a significant reduction in P50 amplitude after exposure to cold, but not room temperature water. In comparison with other studies, these results indicate that cold pressor stimulation in normal subjects may evoke a regulatory process that modulates the P50 amplitude, perhaps to preserve the integrity of sensory perception, even as autonomic and subjective aspects of arousal increase.",

Visuomotor sequence performance in PD patients was closely related to baseline response speed, with robust learning demonstrated by patients who responded with comparable speed to controls but severely impaired performance in patients who responded slowly. In contrast, both fast- and slow-responding PD patients were able to successfully categorise patterns according to their sequential status, a performance that was linked to declarative memory for the sequence. The findings highlight the important role of event timing in SRT performance and are in accord with the hypothesis that, despite the important role played by the basal ganglia in motor sequence learning, basal ganglionic dysfunction may not substantially impair sequence order learning so much as the translation of sequence knowledge into rapid motor performance for some PD patients. Intact pattern judgment on the SRT experiment suggests that the integrity of the neostriatum is not essential for learning judgment-linked categorical information about sequences of temporal stimulus movement.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND METHODS. Rat barrel cortex undergo plastic changes during sensory experience (3). Twenty four hours o f pairing o f untrimmed whiskers leads to short lasting changes in supraand infragranular layers o f corresponding cortical columns. In order to reveal the early dynamics o f this process we studied evoked responses recorded by bipolar electrodes chronically implanted in the barrel cortex o f five hooded rats during classical conditioning. Rats were accustomed to resting in a plexiglass tube with head restrained in a holder. A piezoelectric device stimulated one vibrissa to produce evoked potentials (EP). The experiment consisted o f 5 consecutive daily sessions. During one session, lasting for about an hour, the animal received 100 vibrissa stimulations with intervals randomly scattered from 30 to 45 s. The first two sessions allowed habituation o f the EPs. During the third session, the stimulation o f the vibrissa (CS) was followed by a weak electric shock (US) applied with a 250 ms delay to the ear on the same side. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. Because o f the low noise in the recordings o f the EPs, we used the direct Fourier transform for data parametrization. The fine linear trend was removed and data were tapered with a Hanning window on the segment o f 75 ms including prestimulus baseline (Fig. 1). The distribution o f harmonics corresponding to major spectral peaks was tested with the Rayleigh circular variance test. The observed nonrandom phase histograms were multimodal centred around 13.02 and 39.06 Hz. An unwrapping procedure was used to calculate the absolute values o f phases (1). Phases o f the single responses were always bimodally distributed with the low and high values (-1.6, 5 rads) almost equally frequent in the control period (Fig. 2). First application o f the unconditioning stimulus (US, arrow at the 25 trial) shifts this balance to high value for 13 consecutive responses and this phase occurs almost three times more frequently than the low value, until the end o f the session. The bimodal phase distribution as reported here is similar to stereotyped EPs found in visual system o f cat and human (1,4). The time shift between the two types o f the EPs has been calculated as 5.5 ms which fits the delay o f the second component o f typical barrel EPs (2) , thus allowing recognition o f the high phase component as related to bisynaptic response with sinks in supraand infragranular layers (2) . In these layers, short-lived plastic changes were recently found (3) . W e conclude that supraand infragranular components o f cortical evoked potential undergo plastic changes immediately with first trials o f classical conditioning. I",

The symptoms were greatly pronounced in the left fore limb compared to a slightly impaired left hindlimb. Due to the proprioceptive deficit, the dogs did not have satisfactory control over the position of the distal part of the front limb which caused frequent stumbling and even falling.

The cortical representations were mapped with 2-deoxyglucose (2DG). It was found that six weeks after neonatal vibrissectomy sparing C3 vibrissa and common fur inputs were represented in the PMBSF. Their representation shifted from its normal location into the barrel field. This effect was observed in cortical layers II/III, IV and V.",

Whereas SCH 23390 and haloperidol were by themselves unable to antagonize the cueing properties of cocaine, the combination of both dopamine antagonists resulted in a complete blockade of the cocaine cue. In the presence of a fixed dose of 0.01 and 0.04 mg/kg haloperidol, the ED50's (it is the effective dose in 50% of the animals) of SCH 23390 for cocaine antagonism were 0.043 and 0.012 mg/kg, respectively. Similarly, the ED50's of haloperidol in combination with 0.01 and 0.04 mg/kg SCH 23390 were 0.021 and 0.024 mg/kg. The combined treatment of haloperidol and SCH 23390 resulted in strong response-rate reductions. At all combination regimens resulting in a complete blockade of the cocaine cue, response rate was reduced to less than 20% of the control values. These results indicate that the cueing properties of cocaine are both dopamine D1- and D2-mediated and that a combined antagonism of both receptor subtypes can lead to a complete antagonism of the cueing properties of cocaine which is associated with severe attenuation of response rate.",

The results indicate that projection is profuse and directed to all four nuclei of VNC. The labelling suggests some topographical relationships between lobules and especially sublobules of the posterior lobe and individual nuclei of VNC. The major projection originates from lobules VI and IX. A moderate projection derives from lobule VIII whereas that from lobule VII is small. Projections from the hemisphere arise mainly from crus I and crus II of the ansiform lobule. Those from the copula pyramidis, lobule HV and the ventral paraflocculus are sparse. In the present study a topographical relationships were more precisely established than before because the technique revealed VNC afferents from individual sublobules of the cerebellar posterior lobe cortex.",

    "abstract": "Changes in the strength of synaptic inhibition have profound effects on the functions of cortical neurones. Accumulating evidence suggests that inhibitory synaptic transmission may be the target of actions of monoamines. In the hippocampal dentate gyrus, norepinephrine and serotonin (5-HT) have multiple direct and indirect actions on the presumed inhibitory hilar neurones. These effects are mediated through distinct mechanisms and signalled by different receptor subtypes. The predominant effects of norepinephrine are excitatory and are mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors. Accordingly, both the GABAA- and GABAB-receptor-mediated inhibition in granule cells is enhanced by activation of the beta-adrenergic receptor. 5-HT has more complex effects inhibiting a subpopulation of the hilar neurones and exciting other hilar cells. Study of the effects of 5-HT on inhibition in granule cells revealed that 5-HT enhanced Cl-IPSPs and blocked K-IPSPs. These results are in line with the suggestion that Cl- and K-IPSPs in granule cells are generated by two distinct populations of inhibitory neurones.",

The activity per motor unit was significantly higher both in the partially denervated SOL and EDL muscles. During standing or walking the EMG activity pattern of the partially denervated SOL muscle was similar to normal, while the partially denervated EDL muscle during standing exhibited abnormal tonic activity, and during locomotion its burst duration was strongly correlated to the step cycle duration. Thus, partial denervation led to an overall increase of activity of the remaining motor units in both SOL and EDL muscles, while the temporal pattern of muscle activity during locomotion was drastically altered in EDL muscle only, what indicates that partial denervation influenced the postural activity less than the phasic one.",

Exposure to CVP results in an excess of acetylcholine with subsequent overactivation of the nicotinic as well as muscarinic cholinergic receptors. The purpose of the present experiment was to find out whether a selective activation of muscarinic receptors could induce behavioral hyposensitivity to AMPH. To attain this purpose, male rats were pretreated once with 0.00, 0.135, 0.27 or 0.55 mg/kg of oxotremorine, a muscarinic agonist, and challenged 15 days later with 1.0 mg/kg dose of AMPH. The pre- and postinjection open-field behavior of the rats was tested with the use of a computerized set of activity meters. The testing revealed that in oxotremorine pretreated animals the behavioral response to AMPH, i.e. increase in the ambulatory activity, was not diminished but, to the contrary, it was augmented. This effect was dose-dependent, being most pronounced in rats given the 0.55 mg/kg of oxotremorine. The possible cause of the difference between the effect of CVP and oxotremorine is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Neurophysiologists often use histograms to explore patterns of activity in neural spike trains. The bin size selected to construct a histogram is crucial: too large bin widths result in coarse histograms, too small bin widths expand unimportant detail. Peri-stimulus time (PST) histograms of simulated nerve fibers were studied in the current article. This class of histograms gives information about neural activity in the temporal domain and is a density estimate for the spike rate. Scott's rule based on modern statistical theory suggests that the optimal bin size is inversely proportional to the cube root of sample size. However, this estimate requires a priori knowledge about the density function. Moreover, there are no good algorithms for adaptive-mesh histograms, which have variable bin sizes to minimize estimation errors. Therefore, an unconventional technique is proposed here to help experimenters in practice. This novel method maximizes the entropy of histogram-bar heights to find the unique bin size, which generates the highest disorder in a histogram (i.e., the most complex histogram), and is useful as a starting point for neural data mining. Although the proposed method is ad hoc from a density-estimation point of view, it is simple, efficient and more helpful in the experimental setting where no prior statistical information on neural activity is available. The results of simulations based on the entropy method are also discussed in relation to Ellaway's cumulative-sum technique, which can detect subtle changes in neural activity in certain conditions.",

TPEPs were recorded before, one, three and five hours after continuous stimulation. We observed an inverse relationship between TPEP amplitude and latency with increasing tooth pulp stimulation. The amplitudes of the early components of TPEPs increased and their latency decreased with increasing tooth pulp stimulation intensity. Cortical stimulation decreased the amplitude of TPEPs; however, neither the latencies of TPEPs nor the jaw-opening reflex were changed after cortical stimulation.

The aim of our study was to investigate the pattern of ON and OFF responses in the visual system, measured as amplitude and latency of each VEP component following acute administration of ethanol. VEPs were recorded at the onset and offset of a 500 ms visual stimulus in anesthetized male Wistar rats. The effect of alcohol on VEP latency and amplitude was measured for one hour after injection of 2 g/kg ethanol dose. Three VEP components - N63, P89 and N143 - were analyzed. Our results showed that, except for component N143, ethanol increased the latency of both ON and OFF responses in a similar manner. The latency of N143 during OFF response was not affected by ethanol but its amplitude was reduced. Our study demonstrated that the activation of the visual system during the ON response to a 500 ms visual stimulus is qualitatively different from that during the OFF response. Ethanol interfered with processing of the stimulus duration at the level of the visual cortex and reduced the activation of cortical regions.",

This study investigated the effects of different exercise regimens on allocentric place learning after fimbria‑fornix (FF) transection. One hundred and sixteen pre‑shaped rats were subjected either to a mechanical transection of the FF or control sham surgery and divided into following groups: i) no exercise (NE), ii) voluntary exercise in a running wheel (RW), iii) forced swimming exercise administered as interval training of short (3x5 min) duration (FS‑SI), iv) forced swimming exercise administered as interval training of long (3x15 min) duration (FS‑LI), v) forced swimming exercise administered as one session of short (5 min) duration (FS‑SS), and vi) forced swimming exercise administered as one session of long (15 min) duration (FS‑LS). The exercise was initiated 21 days post‑surgery. Subsequently, all animals were administered 28 acquisition sessions in an 8‑arm radial maze. Both sham operated and lesioned animals showed a significant learning response, however, the lesion induced a marked and lasting impairment, which was not alleviated neither by voluntary nor forced (spaced or one‑session only) exercise regimens. Exercise regimens had no effect on the place learning of control sham animals. We conclude that the lesion location as well as factors related to the exercise‑ and cognitive testing protocols can profoundly influence the potential of exercise as a general recovery‑promoting method.",

A series of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusions of salsolinol, in two doses, was performed in nursing sheep, without suckling, during the fifth week of lactation. In other suckling sheep, we infused i.c.v. a structural analogue of salsolinol – 1-methyl-3,4-dihydroisoqinoline (1-MeDIQ), which is able to antagonize salsolinol’s action. Intracerebroventricular treatment of nursing sheep with a lower dose of salsolinol (total 50 ng) significantly increased plasma GH concentration, as compared with the concentrations noted before the infusion and in nursing controls. A higher dose of salsolinol (total 5 micrograms) did not affect GH release significantly. Intracerebroventricular treatment with 1-MeDIQ (total 300 micrograms) significantly reduced basal GH release, not affecting a pattern of GH surge in response to suckling. In conclusion, salsolinol may affect the regulatory process of GH secretion in lactating sheep, but its role seems not to be major.",

A noncompetitive antagonist of NMDA receptors, MK-801, 0.8 mg/kg, was injected i.p. 30 min before ischemia, or the ganglioside GM1, 30 mg/kg, was given i.p. for 3 days, twice a day. The morphology of the hippocampal CA1 neurones and the brain content of cyclooxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid: prostaglandin 6-keto PGF1 alpha and thromboxane Tx B2 were studied. Untreated ischemia induced the accumulation in brain of the 6-keto PGF1 alpha and Tx B2 immunoreactive materials, and resulted in a lesion of 70% of CA1 neurones. In the MK-801- and GM1-pretreated groups the postischemic levels of Tx B2 were significantly decreased. However MK-801 and GM1 did not prevent damage to the CA1 neurones in gerbils normothermic after ischemia, whereas a partial neuroprotection was observed in hypothermic, MK-801 treated gerbils. The results of this study indicate that NMDA receptors may participate in the mechanism of postischemic release of eicosanoids in brain. They also confirm a potential modulatory role of gangliosides. These results are discussed in terms of the involvement of cyclooxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid in the mechanism of a selective delayed neuronal damage to the hippocampus CA1 after ischemia.",

Injections of Fast Blue and Diamidino Yellow made in twelve rabbits into the regions of the left and right PML cortex, respectively, resulted in retrograde double labeling of neurons in the principal trigeminal (Vp) and spinal trigeminal nuclei including subnucleus oralis (Vo), and rostral (Vir) and caudal (Vic) subnucleus interpolaris. Sparse labeling was seen among the root fibers of the facial nerve immediately adjacent to Vp. The data indicated that out of the total population of ipsilateral and contralateral single labeled neurons in TSN subdivisions, double labeled neurons constituted about 11% in Vo, 2% in Vp and Vir, and 1% in Vic. Thus, it seems that out of TSN neurons sending collateral projections to PML of both hemispheres, those in Vo project more frequently than those in Vp, Vir and Vic. The homotopic (corresponding) middle (c and d) PML sublobules receive collateral projections from neurons of all these TSN subdivisions, whereas the caudal (a and b) and rostral (e and f) sublobules seem to be targets of the projection from Vp and Vir. The findings suggest that some TSN neurons may exert simultaneous bilateral modulatory influences upon the regions in various sublobules of both PML.",

In addition, the effect of two beta-amyloid (A beta) peptides, 1-28 and 25-35, on the resting and MAChR-induced increase of [Ca]i in brain cortex synaptoneurosomes of adult rats was evaluated. Release of IP3 was measured after prelabeling of synaptoneurosomal phosphoinositides with myo-[2-3H]inositol. Changes in [Ca]i were monitored by using fura-2 indicator. The effect of A beta peptides was evaluated following their preincubation with synaptoneurosomal protein for 1, 5, 30 and 60 min. It was observed that in brain cortex synaptoneurosomes from aged rats, Ca(2+)-dependent and MAChR-mediated IP3 production was not changed in comparison with that estimated in adult brain, over 60 min of incubation. Activation of MAChR in synaptoneurosomes from brain cortex of adult rats for 10 min increased [Ca]i by about 60% over its resting level (240 nM). This increase was completely blocked by muscarinic antagonists, atropine and pirenzepine, as well as by the antagonist of IP3 receptor, 8-(diethylamino)-octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate (TMB-8). In aged brain, there was no detectable change in resting [Ca]i (165 nM) due to MAChR stimulation. The 25-35 A beta peptide caused a time-dependent significant increase of resting [Ca]i in synaptoneurosomes from brain cortex of adult rats, which was almost five-fold after 60 min. In the same conditions, the action of 1-28 A beta peptide was statistically insignificant up to 30 min, then a rapid increase of resting [Ca]i by two-fold was observed up to 60 min. Both A beta peptides decreased markedly the MAChR-dependent elevation of [Ca]i in respect to control (resting [Ca]i) in synaptoneurosomes from brain cortex of adult rats. These results indicate that beta-amyloid 1-28 and 25-35 peptides may be involved in alteration of muscarinic receptor-mediated signal transduction during brain aging.",

In the present study, the work performed within successive tetani during the fatigue test of rat medial gastrocnemius motor units was estimated by assessing of the area under the tension record. Resistance to fatigue was evaluated by a modified fatigue index which is expressed as the ratio of the area under a tetanus recorded two minutes after maximal potentiation of tension has been reached to the area under this maximally potentiated tetanus. The values of this modified fatigue index were compared to the standard fatigue index which was taken as the ratio of peak tensions for corresponding tetani. For fast fatigable units, values of the modified fatigue index were significantly lower than those of the standard index. This observation resulted from changes in the shape of unfused tetani accompanying developing fatigue. These changes strongly influenced the area under the tension record whereas the peak tension of these tetani diminished less significantly. For slow and a part of fast resistant to fatigue units (with the standard fatigue index above 0.85) the modified fatigue index was slightly higher than the standard one although the difference was not significant. This phenomenon was due to the prolongation of relaxation which was visible in the last part of the fatigue test. It is being concluded that the modified fatigue index describes more precisely the fatigue-induced changes in tetani during the fatigue test than the standard fatigue index, especially in fast fatigable units.",

Every spike was seen to consist of a spike complex made up of two separate biphasic components thought to originate from two separate cells. The larger action potential, appearing first, had a peak-to-peak (ptp) amplitude of up to 200 microV followed closely by a smaller spike with an amplitude of about 60 microV. The repetitive firing pattern was not affected by air or odour puffs. This kind of consistent spontaneous spiking activity of two closely associated cells resembles remarkably closely the clock-spikes hitherto known only from the eyes of flies. Our encounter with such cells in a sense organ other than the eye poses many new questions and could lead to a renewed effort to understand the role(s) of the clock-spiking cells as possible oscillatory components of the dipteran pacemaking system in particular and the insect nervous systems, generally.",

Their ASR were compared with those from the 10 intact rats that formed a control group. The ASR was tested during two sessions with different illumination of the acoustic chamber. During the first session the rats were tested in the darkness while during the second test the acoustic chamber was illuminated with a 15 W bulb. Irradiation resulted in a significant reduction of granule cells of the hippocampus (about 55%). The lesion resulted in emotional and behavioral changes evidenced by modification of the ASR. The irradiated rats exhibited a significantly increased amplitude of the startle response. In contrast to the light condition, the darkness context caused a decline of the ASR amplitude in the control group and failed to elicit significant changes in the lesioned animals. The results support the hypothesis that hippocampal lesions disrupt motor inhibition.",

Axonal conduction velocities measured between S2 and C6 segments were in the range of 42-78 m/s.

    "abstract": "Caffeine in 10(-2) M concentration per se activates ryanodine receptors (RyR) in vitro, thereby increasing the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i). In general opinion, caffeine applied in vivo in much lower doses does not affect [Ca2+]i in neurones. However, it was recently demonstrated that caffeine in low concentrations in vitro potentiates evoked Ca2+ release in neurones via RyR. Microdialysis of the rat dentate gyrus (DG), combined with measurement of 45Ca2+ efflux, has been used in our laboratory to study in vivo NMDA-evoked calcium induced calcium release (CICR) via RyR. The aim of the present microdialysis study was to investigate in vivo effects of caffeine, applied systemically in a pharmacologically-relevant dose, and locally in the dialysis medium in very high concentration, on the NMDA-evoked CICR in DG neurones. To ensure steady brain concentration of caffeine, its systemic (i.p.) administration in a dose of 40 mg/kg was followed by a continuous i.p. infusion of 80 micrograms/kg/min and application of 0.4 mM caffeine in the dialysis medium. The results demonstrated that in the rat DG, local administration of 50 mM caffeine significantly stimulates a spontaneous 45Ca2+ efflux and its release induced by 5 mM NMDA. However, systemic administration of caffeine had no effect on spontaneous and NMDA-induced 45Ca2+ release in the rat DG, which supports the view that caffeine, applied in vivo, even in high doses, does not influence CICR in brain neurones.",

At low concentrations of DL-AHM, L-AHM and DLM (50-150 microM) the population spike was permanently amplified. NMDA receptor antagonists blocked this facilitatory effect of L-AHM, DL-AHM and DLM. At higher concentrations (400-700 microM) DL-AHM and DLM abolished the population spike, while L-AHM did not eliminate the population spike at any concentration tested. None of these uptake inhibitors influenced an antidromic potential recorded in Ca(2+)- free Ringer solution. PDC at lower concentrations (75 microM) did not affect the population spike and at higher concentrations (150 microM-500 microM) induced only a transient elevation in population spike. Our data demonstrate that modification of glutamate uptake may be an important factor in the regulation of synaptic efficiency of glutamergic pathways.",

Reaction time (RT) for a compatible S-R assignment (bright-strong; dim-weak) was substantially shorter than for an incompatible S-R assignment (dim-strong; bright-weak). This effect was explained as a direct translation of stimulus intensity to response force (RF). In the present study, we looked for other stimulus features that could be directly transferred to RF. We investigated stimulus size (large/small), vertical location (above/below), and brightness (bright/dim). Delays of RT for incompatible trials were found in case of brightness and size, but not location. In a second experiment, we tested whether such a direct translation might even cause changes of spontaneous RF. Without being instructed about RF, participants made simple reactions to stimuli which differed either in location, size or brightness. Indeed, stimulus size affected RF: larger stimuli were associated with stronger responses. In contrast, brightness had no effect. Thus, we replicated and extended Romaiguère et al.’s (1993) finding. However, the direct-translation account for RF variations received only partial support from our data.",

Previous research suggested links between impaired humor comprehension, psychopathology symptoms and cognitive deficits. In this study, we investigated the associations between neural substrates of humor processing and psychopathology and cognition in schizophrenia. We assessed 25 schizophrenia outpatients in an functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) procedure and 40 in an electroencephalography (EEG) procedure. A punchline-based humor comprehension task was used in which outpatients rated stories by their comprehensibility and funniness. The symptom severity and cognition were correlated with activation within the humor processing network using fMRI and effective connectivity using an EEG-based directed transfer function (DTF) method. More severe positive and disorganization symptoms were associated with impaired humor comprehension and with altered temporo-parietal effective connectivity during humor processing. More severe excitement and emotional reactivity symptoms were associated with increased activation in the bilateral frontal and temporo-parietal regions. Moreover, schizophrenia outpatients with better cognitive functioning were more accurate in humor comprehension that was associated with increased fronto-temporo-parietal activation and effective connectivity. We found the intensity of humor processing (fMRI) in schizophrenia is related to the level of cognitive abilities and the severity of schizophrenia psychopathology that is also reflected in altered effective connectivity (EEG-DTF) in the humor processing network.",

This study examines whether modulation of scopolamine-induced fear memory deficit by anodal tDCS could be mediated by the dopaminergic system. The male NMRI mice received scopolamine, 30 min before fear conditioning, and showed impaired contextual memory retention. Mice subjected to left frontal anodal stimulation for 20 or 30 min, before fear conditioning, impaired fear memory retrieval. Anodal application for 20 min significantly decreased scopolamine response on fear retention, while the one applied for 30 min did not alter. Moreover, anodal stimulation for 30 min abolished scopolamine-induced fear memory deficit. Dopaminergic antagonists SCH23390 and sulpiride, alone or in combination, prevented the abolishment effect of anodal stimulation on scopolamine-induced fear memory deficit, whereas they did not alter the impairing effect of scopolamine at the dose of 2 mg/kg. Our data suggest that anodal stimulation for 30 min abrogates the impairing effect of scopolamine on fear memory retention. This influence could be prevented by dopaminergic antagonists, indicating the involvement of the dopaminergic system in the effect of anodal stimulation on scopolamine-induced fear memory deficit.",

The present study explored the protective effect of DEX on sevoflurane‑induced learning and cognitive impairment and examined its underlying mechanism. Sprague‑Dawley rat pups were exposed to 0.85% sevoflurane for 6 h and injected with DEX in different doses. The Morris water maze test was performed to evaluate the learning and memory function of rats. Western blot was used for the measurement of protein levels. The water maze results indicated that sevoflurane treatment increased the escape latency but reduced the time spent in the original quadrant of rats. The protein levels of NR2B, phosphorylated ERK were significantly influenced by sevoflurane. Ifenprodil administration alleviated sevoflurane‑induced neurological impairment. DEX treatment reversed the effect of sevoflurane on both escape latency and time in original quadrant in a dose manner, and pretreatment with DEX had the most dramatic effect. DEX regulated the NR2B/ERK signaling in sevoflurane treated rats. NR2B/ERK signaling is involved in sevoflurane induced neurological impairment. DEX may protect against sevoflurane induced neurological dysfunction in the developing rat brain via regulating the NR2B/ERK signaling.",

WMI leads to reduced myelination, inflammation, and clinical neurodevelopmental deficits for which there are no effective treatments. Ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) induced excitotoxicity contributes to oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage cell loss and demyelination in brain models of neonatal and adult WMI. Here, we hypothesized that simulated ischemia (oxygen‑glucose deprivation) damages white matter via activation of iGluR signaling, and that iGluR inhibition shortly after WMI could mitigate OL loss, enhance myelination, and suppress inflammation in an ex vivo cerebellar slice model of developing WMI. Inhibition of iGluR signaling by a combined block of AMPA and NMDA receptors, shortly after simulated ischemia, restored myelination, reduced apoptotic OLs, and enhanced OL precursor cell proliferation and maturation as well as upregulated expression of transcription factors regulating OL development and remyelination. Our findings demonstrate that iGluR inhibition post‑injury alleviates OL lineage cell loss and inflammation and promotes myelination upon developing WMI. The findings may help to develop therapeutic interventions for the WMI treatment.",

This was followed by the conditioning session (30 min), in which the animals were conditioned with escalating doses of heroin hydrochloride (5, 10, 20, 40 and 40 mg/kg) for 5 days upon entry into the goal box. On day 6, the run time of each mouse, from start to goal box, was recorded during the post conditioning test.

MMC given as oral doses (1, 3 and 5 g/kg) dose‑dependently prolonged the run time to reach the goal box, indicating MMC attenuated heroin reinforcement.

Both are reflected in electrodermal activity and measured by skin conductance level. Our previous studies in this area have indicated that physiological responses to stimuli in a task are dependent on the arousal level at the time of stimulus presentation, rather than the task-related activation. In contrast, performance on the task is dependent on the task-related activation, rather than the current arousal level. That is, different aspects of the individual’s state determine physiological and behavioral responses. Those studies had examined between-subjects differences in arousal and activation. The present study investigated the relevance of this separation in an across-subjects examination of fluctuations in arousal and activation, and their effects on physiological and behavioral responses, during a continuous performance task. It was found that the magnitude of the phasic orienting reflex to the targets during the task was dependent mainly on arousal, rather than task-related relative activation. Reaction time improved with increasing relative activation, but not with arousal. These findings support our earlier conclusions relating to the usefulness of arousal and activation as distinguishable features of the energetics of physiological and behavioral functions.",

    "abstract": "The effect of difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the rate limiting enzyme of polyamine biosynthesis, and its combined action with GM1 ganglioside, was studied on the GFAP content in a model of remote astrogliosis evoked in the hippocampus by lateral fimbria transection. DFMO markedly suppressed hippocampal gliosis as measured by GFAP immunoblotting seven days postsurgery. Combined treatment with DFMO and GM1 ganglioside--a substance which alone also counteracts hippocampal gliosis, produced a stronger suppressive effect than DFMO. The results support the hypothesis of a causal link between lesion induced events: polyamine biosynthesis and astroglial reaction. Potentiation of the inhibitory effect of DFMO by GM1 ganglioside suggests that the latter does not act through the mechanism involving ODC suppression.",

    "abstract": "Object exploration was examined in naloxone injected (l mg/kg or 4 mg/kg) and saline control rats. Naloxone rats explored an object for a shorter time than did controls, thus indicating a lower investigatory motivation. This effect was dose dependent. Higher drug dose (4 mg/kg) decreased the number of contacts with an object. Both doses increased the mean duration of contacts with an object. The naloxone groups showed intact recognition of a familiar object paired with a new one in two sessions – 4 h and 24 h after the injections. The higher drug dose depressed the locomotor activity and wall leaning. Grooming was not influenced by naloxone. The normal daily fluctuations in the level of grooming and locomotion were distorted following the injection of the higher dose of naloxone. The lower dose (l mg/kg) did not affect the rats' performance in some tests. The results could be viewed as a naloxone-related depression of the behavior containing motor elements like locomotion, wall leaning and object approaching. The prolonged contact time with an object could be the result of a lowered flexibility of movement. However, the decrease of rewarding value of exploration could not be ruled out. Possibly, naloxone exerts several different interacting behavioral effects.",

Previously we showed that NO modified quinpirole-induced yawning, a behavioral measure of dopamine (DA) D3 receptor activation in rats. The aim of this study was to characterize the effect of nitro-L-arginine methyl ester HCl (NAME) and L-arginine HCl on reactivity of rats to the DA D1 receptor agonist SKF 38393 and DA D1 antagonist SCH 23390 in intact and neonata16-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats (134 micrograms of base ICV at 3rd day after birth). L-arginine HCl (300 mg/kg IP) increased the oral activity response in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, like SKF 38393, and induced catalepsy in intact control rats, like SCH 23390. In contrast, NAME had no effect on oral activity or catalepsy, but fully attenuated SKF 38393-induced oral activity. These findings indicate that L-arginine HCl has no apparent effect at the DA D1 receptor, but that NAME is effective in attenuating a DA D1 agonist-induced effect. Consequently NO may be an intracellular second messenger for supersensitized receptors associated with DA D1 agonist-induced oral activity.",

Subjects were divided into two subgroups on the basis of the first measure of their individual mean RT (above and below the group median). Each subject received 10 innocuous auditory stimuli with randomly varying interstimulus intervals. Stimuli were presented in one of two conditions defined by instructions allowing them to ignore (irrelevant condition), or requiring them to count the stimuli (relevant condition). A main effect of instruction was obtained in the evoked cardiac response. The initial heart rate deceleration was significantly larger in the irrelevant condition and a later acceleration was significantly larger in the relevant condition. Short-RT subjects had smaller heart rate changes to the irrelevant stimuli. The data are discussed in terms of the intensity of stimulus processing (both physical and cognitive) as a factor which may be related fundamentally to stable individual differences in RT.",

It was found that ATP added into brain slices activated significantly and specifically PtdIns(4,5)P2 degradation and this process was inhibited by theophylline. Moreover, ATP maintained a higher level of inositol(1,4,5)P3 radioactivity in total water-soluble inositol metabolites. However, ATP added directly for the assay of PLC into brain homogenate or subcellular fractions inhibits phosphoinositide degradation in a receptor-independent manner and suppresses conversion of Ins(1,4,5)P3 into Ins(1,4)P2. Our results indicate that ATP acting extracellularly through a purinergic receptor(s) activates PtdIns(4,5)P2 degradation and release of Ins(1,4,5)P3.

In these experiments we compare expression of NMDA-evoked 45Ca release in the rat dentate gyrus (DG), CA1 and subiculum (SUB). The rationale behind introducing this study is that these hippocampal regions are known to differ in their levels of ryanodine receptors. The release of 45Ca was studied using in vivo microdialysis combined with measurements of 45Ca efflux from prelabelled hippocampal regions. It was shown that NMDA-induced 45Ca release, highly pronounced in the rat DG/CA4, is significantly less expressed in the CA1, whereas in the SUB an NMDA-evoked decrease in 45Ca efflux was noted. This corresponds to distribution of ryanodine receptors in the rat hippocampus, known from the literature. Expression of NMDA-evoked 45Ca release in these rat hippocampal regions which are enriched in ryanodine receptors supports our working hypothesis that CICR via ryanodine channels may be mainly responsible for 45Ca release.",

The rhythm of the hormone production, with maximal levels occurring at night in darkness, is generated by an endogenous circadian clock(s) and is synchronized with the photoperiodic environment to which animals are exposed. This brief outline surveys data on the regulation of rhythmic melatonin biosynthesis by a circadian pacemaker and light (full spectrum white light and monochromatic lights with wavelengths both in the visible and invisible range). Additionally, possible applications of this chronobiotic compound in agriculture and in medicine in the treatment of circadian rhythm sleep disorders are discussed.",

In both types of fast units (fast fatigable and fast resistant) the changes in the fusion index were similar to those in tetanic tension: first they increased and then decreased. However, the increase of the fusion index was longer than that of tension and the subsequent decrease in the fusion index was smaller than that of tetanic tension. Furthermore, the initial increase in the fusion index of fast fatigable motor units was .greater than in the tension. The dependence of the fusion index on twitch time enables the analysis of the influence of changes in the twitch time on changes in tension of unfused tetani observed during activity of fast motor units.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the function of nerve ending particles after acute lead exposure and to investigate whether it exerts a toxic effect on astroglial functions. The studies were performed using the rodent model of acute lead toxicity. Cellular fractions were used in biochemical measurements - synaptosomes and glial plasmalemmal vesicles (GPV). Since a procedure for the isolation of the fraction of astroglial origin has been developed, it becomes possible to investigate lead-astroglia interactions after in vivo exposure. It is of importance because most of the studies concerning lead toxicity were performed using astroglial culture systems. It was found that the uptake of glutamate (Glu) to the synaptosomes was lowered and KCl-dependent release was increased, suggesting the impairment of glutamatergic transmission leading to the elevation of extracellular amino acid concentration. In contrast, glutamate uptake to the GPV fraction was significantly elevated. The activity of the marker enzyme - glutamine synthetase (GS) was also significantly increased in the GPV fraction. The activation of glial functions suggest a regulatory role for these cells in the early period of acute lead toxicity.",

Three experiments were conducted. In the first, five groups of rats were acutely treated with different doses of Triazolam (0.25 mg/kg-4.0 mg/kg), In the second experiment, rats were treated chronically with a single daily dose of Triazolam (started with 0.25 mg/kg and increased by time to 1.0 mg/kg) for 5 weeks, simulating clinical use. In the third, rats were treated chronically with three daily doses of Triazolam (started with 0.25 mg/kg and increased by time to 0.5 mg/kg) for 20 days, representing a form of drug abuse. Brain levels of GABA and plasma levels of Triazolam were measured using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The acute Triazolam administration produced an increase in GABA levels in all brain areas studied. The chronic administration of single daily dose of Triazolam produced normal GABA levels in all brain areas except brain stem where the levels were significantly decreased; this indicates the development of tolerance to Triazolam action on increasing GABA content. The chronic administration of three daily doses of Triazolam produced a decrease in GABA levels in all brain regions studied. In conclusion, chronic single daily dose treatment (representing normal use) produces tolerance to Triazolam effects on brain GABA levels, while chronic three daily doses administration (akin to drug abuse) causes a fall in GABA levels.",

In this technical communication, we propose a cell-based fluorescence assay to study the neurogenesis of adult hippocampal progenitor cells that can be used for high-throughput screening of drugs promoting neurogenesis. Three fluorescent dyes (DAPI, Alexa Fluor 488, and Alexa Fluor 594) and a fluorescence spectrophotometry reader were used, which confirmed that the mutual interference of the three fluorescent dyes is very low. We used this cell-based fluorescence assay to evaluate the effects of three neurotrophic factors, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and IGF-2 on the promotion of neurogenesis in adult hippocampal neural progenitor cells. The fluorescence intensity ratio of the neuronal marker, class III β-tubulin, to the housekeeping protein, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, or nuclear staining dye, DAPI, in CNTF-treated cells was significantly higher than in control cells. The ratios in IGF-1 and IGF-2-treated cells were slightly higher under higher cell density conditions. These results are consistent with those in previous reports; therefore, this report proved the efficacy of this method. Taken together, the results showed that this simple, rapid, and economical cell-based immunofluorescence assay could be a powerful tool for the rapid screening of drugs that promote adult neurogenesis.",

Its function in the brain's autonomic areas has been studied, and it has been reported that alarin is involved in the regulation of excitability in hypothalamic neurons. Its role in the regulation of excitability in the hippocampus, however, is unknown. In this study, we investigated if alarin induced any synchronous discharges or epileptiform activity, and if it had any effect on already initiated epileptiform discharges. We used thick acute horizontal hippocampal slices obtained from 30‑ to 35‑day‑old rats. Extracellular field potential recordings were evaluated in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Our data demonstrated that, alarin application did not result in any epileptiform activity or abnormal discharges. 4‑aminopyridine was applied to induce epileptiform activity in the slices. We found that alarin increased the frequency of interictal‑like events and the mean power of local field potentials in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, which was induced by 4‑aminopyridine. These results demonstrated for the first time that alarin has a modulatory effect on synchronized neuronal discharges and showed the contribution of the neuropeptide alarin to epilepsy‑like conditions.",

    "abstract": "This study focused on the association of LINC01270 and computed tomography (CT) signs with glioma development, to evaluate their potential in the early detection of glioma. Serum LINC01270 was evaluated in glioma patients and healthy individuals using PCR. The involvement of LINC01270 in glioma onset and development was evaluated by ROC and chi‑square test. The association of LINC01270 with the CT signs and their combined effects in the diagnosis in glioma were also estimated. Serum LINC01270 was significantly elevated in glioma patients, which was closely associated with patients' advanced WHO grades and lower KPS. Both LINC01270 upregulation and CT findings showed significant potential in diagnosing glioma, and LINC01270 correlated significantly with the invasion risk and metastasis indicated on CT. The combination of LINC01270 expression and CT findings significantly improved the sensitivity and specificity of glioma diagnosis. Upregulated LINC01270 in glioma is associated with malignant and severe disease development and has significant diagnostic value. Combined detection of LINC01270 and CT findings could improve the diagnostic efficacy in glioma cases, thus optimizing clinical diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "We employed intrinsic signal optical imaging (ISOI) to investigate orientation sensitivity bias in the visual cortex of young mice. Optical signals were recorded in response to the moving light gratings stimulating ipsi‑, contra‑ and binocular eye inputs. ISOI allowed visualization of cortical areas activated by gratings of specific orientation and temporal changes of light scatter during visual stimulation. These results confirmed ISOI as a reliable technique for imaging the activity of large populations of neurons in the mouse visual cortex. Our results revealed that the contralateral ocular input activated a larger area of the primary visual cortex than the ipsilateral input, and caused the highest response amplitudes of light scatter signals to all ocular inputs. Horizontal gratings moved in vertical orientation induced the most significant changes in light scatter when presented contralaterally and binocularly, surpassing stimulations by vertical or oblique gratings. These observations suggest dedicated integration mechanisms for the combined inputs from both eyes. We also explored the relationship between point luminance change (PLC) of grating stimuli and ISOI time courses under various orientations of movements of the gratings and ocular inputs, finding higher cross-correlation values for cardinal orientations and ipsilateral inputs. These findings suggested specific activation of different neuronal assemblies within the mouse’s primary visual cortex by grating stimuli of the corresponding orientation. However, further investigations are needed to examine this summation hypothesis. Our study highlights the potential of optical imaging as a valuable tool for exploring functional‑anatomical relationships in the mouse visual system.",

    "abstract": "Social contagion is a pervasive phenomenon and an important social influence that involves the rapid dissemination (propagation) of behaviors, attitudes, emotions, or ideas from one person to another, often without conscious reflection or rational thought. This phenomenon is closely related to conformity, by which a person changes his/her original ideas and attitude and imitates certain behavior of others. Although some behavioral research has been carried out on contagion and conformity, there is very little neuropsychological understanding of these phenomena. Existing research on social influence and conformity has predominantly focused on tasks like mental rotation or rating tasks involving facial expressions, with fewer studies exploring risk preferences and temporal discounting. However, there is a notable gap in the literature when it comes to examining social influence and conformity using other‑regarding preferencemodels derived from heterodox economics. To address this research gap, the present study investigates the neuropsychological underpinnings of social contagion by utilizing event‑related potentials (ERPs) recorded while subjects engage in mini‑dictator games. The behavioral analysis revealed that contagion had an impact on the participants’ preferences, leading to a change in their choices. We observed a P300 component in the midline and right posterior during the time window of 200‑350 ms after stimulus onset, which showed a significant increase in mean amplitude when participants observed others’ behavior, compared to when they made decisions based on their own preferences. Moreover, the lack of late positive potential in the time window of 500‑650 ms suggests that the presence of P300 may indicate difficulty in making decisions. In summary, by analyzing both behavioral and ERP data, this study may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the cognitive and neural processes that drive conformity and contagion behavior. Our analysis has the potential to inform policymakers in developing effective interventions for promoting positive social behaviors and reducing negative ones.",

    "abstract": "The present study was assumed that N‑acetylcysteine (AC) might improve cognitive function in adolescent rats with hypothyroidism through various mechanisms. Sixty adolescent rats were randomly divided into the following groups: Vehicle (received normal saline intraperitoneally (IP)); Propylthiouracil (PTU)‑induced hypothyroidism (0.05%, dissolved in drinking water); Hypothyroid rats were IP treated with different doses of AC (50, 100, and 150 mg/kg/day) for a period of six weeks; Normal rats treated with the highest doses of AC (150 mg/kg/day). Behavioral and biochemical analyses were studied for all groups. In the Morris water maze test, AC significantly reduced both the time to find the hidden platform and the distance travelled as compared to non‑treated hypothyroid rats. In the passive avoidance test, the latency of entering the dark chamber was significantly increased by AC, whereas decreased the time spent in the darkroom of the chamber compared to the hypothyroid rats. In biochemical results, AC reduced both malondialdehyde content and nitrite while increased the thiol content, catalase and superoxide dismutase enzymes activity in both the cortex and the hippocampus, and a notable improvement in brain‑derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in hippocampal tissues of the hypothyroid rats, while decreasing the level of interleukin‑6 in rat hippocampal region. Therefore, based on the results, the beneficial effects of AC on cognitive impairment in adolescent hypothyroid rats are probably related to its anti‑oxidant properties and notable improvement in BDNF levels.",

OCD presents a variety of different etiologies including environmental, viral, cognitive, or genetic aspects. In this article, we focused on the possible correlation between various infectious diseases as well as generally the relationship between viruses, bacteria, and parasites, and an increased OCD risk. In this narrative review, we analyzed different types of articles found on PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus, as well as the articles of the National Institute of Mental Health. Searching criteria included articles from 1991 till the end of November, research involving human and animal patients (including monkeys and rats), and research published in English. Research showed a relationship between Herpes simplex virus, Rubella virus, Human immunodeficiency virus, Borna disease virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Toxoplasma gondii, streptococcal infections, as well as gut microbiota and increased OCD risk. The possible mechanisms of this relation include neuroinflammation, brain tissue damage, autoimmune processes, and impairments in neurotransmitter levels. Infections caused by Varicella zoster virus, Measles virus, Mumps virus, Epstein‑Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, or Borrelia Burgdorferi may also contribute to the increased risk of OCD. Reports showed an increased frequency of OCD occurrence in a group of infected people compared to a healthy group. However, there is no evidence of the influence of Influenza virus, Coxsackie virus, Poliovirus, Parvovirus B19, Enterovirus 71, West Nile virus, Treponema Pallidum, or Toxocara infections on the OCD risk. There is a significant relationship between various infectious diseases and an increased OCD risk. However, further studies are crucial to discover the exact pathomechanisms of these correlations and the potential influence of other pathogens on the onset of OCD.",

    "abstract": "Phenylketonuria (PKU) stems from a rare genetic metabolic imbalance attributed to an insufficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Within the context of PKU, brain‑derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a pivotal role in brain function. 7,8‑dihydroxyflavone (7,8‑DHF) operates as a tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) agonist, mimicking the effects of BDNF. This study aimed to examine the effects of administering 7,8‑DHF in chemically‑induced rat models specifically induced to simulate PKU chemically. The rats were subcutaneously injected with phenylalanine and p‑chlorophenylalanine, a phenylalanine hydroxylase inhibitor, along with 7,8‑DHF. The injections began on the 2nd day after birth and continued until the 10th day. Levels of interleukin‑1β (IL‑1β), interleukin‑6 (IL‑6), interleukin‑33 (IL‑33), BDNF, malondialdehyde (MDA), monoamine oxidase (MAO), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the brain tissues were quantified using the enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) was performed to assess the gene expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), nuclear factor kappa beta (NF‑κB), caspase‑3, nuclear factor erythroid 2‑related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase‑1 (HO‑1), and BDNF. The results showed a decrease in mRNA levels of iNOS, IL‑1β, IL‑6, and lipid peroxidation in the group that received 7,8‑DHF. These results indicate that administering 7,8‑DHF has the potential to reduce brain damage in PKU by lowering proinflammatory cytokine levels and lipid peroxidation in PKU models. Thus, 7,8‑DHF, as a small molecule, might offer a promising adjunct therapeutic approach for PKU.",

    "abstract": "The thalamic reticular nucleus controls information processing in thalamocortical neurons. GABAergic neurons present in this nucleus express the α3 subunit of post‑synaptic GABAA receptors, which bind GABA from globus pallidus neurons. Pallidal neurons, in turn, have dopaminergic D4 receptors in their axon terminals. The thalamic reticular nucleus connects reciprocally with the thalamus, and it receives afferents from the brain cortex, as well as from other brain structures that have an important role in the modulation of the thalamic network. Based on the above, the purpose of this study was to assess the electrophysiological and molecular effects of unilateral lesion of the globus pallidus on the electric activity of the thalamic reticular nucleus. Two‑month‑old male rats were used. The right globus pallidus was lesioned with quinolinic acid. Seven days after the lesion, ipsilateral turning was registered, confirming the lesion. Afterward, electrophysiological evaluation of the right thalamic reticular nucleus' electrical activity was performed. Subsequently, mRNA expression for D4 receptors and subunit α3, as well as protein content were assessed in the right reticular nucleus. Pallidum lesion caused an increase in firing frequency and decreased firing bursts of reticular neurons. In addition, dopaminergic D4 mRNA, as well as protein increased. In contrast, GABAergic GABAA subunit α3 expression was suppressed, but protein content increased. These results show that the globus pallidus regulates firing in reticular neurons through D4 receptors and subunit α3 of GABAA receptor in the reticular nucleus of the thalamus.",

The mice were perfused with Ringer's solution (control) and COA‑Cl (0.05, 0.1, or 0.5 mM) into the dorsal striatum. Dialysate samples were collected every 30 min and then analyzed using high‑performance liquid chromatography coupled with an electrochemical detector. We found that local perfusion of COA‑Cl (0.1 or 0.5 mM) into the dorsal striatum of living mice produced a significant and dose‑dependent increase in extracellular levels of DA, 3‑methoxytyramine (3‑MT), and homovanillic acid (HVA), where only 0.5 mM COA‑Cl increased dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels. However, 0.05 mM of COA‑Cl did not significantly affect either DA levels or its metabolites. Then, we administered the monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor clorgyline alone or in combination with COA‑Cl (0.1 mM) to test whether COA‑Cl‑induced increases in DOPAC and HVA are mediated by increased MAO activity. Clorgyline alone increased 3‑MT levels and decreased DOPAC and HVA levels but not DA levels. When combined with COA‑Cl, clorgyline increased 3‑MT levels and reversed the decrease in DOPAC and HVA levels caused by clorgyline. The increase in DA metabolism induced by COA‑Cl suggests that some DA was further metabolized into DOPAC, 3‑MT, and HVA. This indicates that COA‑Cl plays a role in DA metabolism via increased DA release and/or activation of MAO, offering new insights into the effects of COA‑Cl on DA metabolism in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age‑related, progressive decline in cognitive ability. Accumulation and deposition of amyloid‑β (Aβ) is still the best‑known cause of AD that worsens over time. It is unclear whether the increase in Aβ production or the inefficiency of the degradation system causes the accumulation of β‑fibrils during AD development. This research investigated Aβ‑producing and clearance pathways in different stages of AD. For this purpose, patients were categorized into four experimental groups: patients with mild cognitive impairment, patients with moderate cognitive decline, patients with very severe cognitive decline, and healthy patients as control. Levels of Aβ‑40, soluble amyloid precursor protein beta (sAPPβ), matrix metalloproteinase‑9 (MMP‑9), matrix metalloproteinase‑3 (MMP‑3), neprilysin (NEP), angiotensin‑converting enzyme (ACE), and insulin‑degrading enzyme (IDE) were determined by ELISA kits and immunoblotting in serum samples. According to the results, the levels of Aβ‑40 and sAPPβ increased in AD patients from an early stage, and levels were maintained in progressive AD stages. MMP‑9 also increased in the early stage, but its content decreased with disease development. MMP‑3 was significantly higher in the three stages of AD compared to the control patients. However, IDE, NEP, and ACE enzymes as clearing systems decreased in all studied AD samples, with their reductions more remarkable in the middle and late stages. The results showed that multiple Aβ‑degrading enzymes such as NEP and IDE in AD patients decline as AD progresses, while Aβ‑40 and sAPPβ increased from the early stage of the disease. Therefore, it could be concluded that detection of the dementia phase is a critical step for therapeutic strategies.",

Consequently, extensive research is being conducted on drugs targeting inflammation and immune response. Leflunomide, known for its anti‑inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, is currently used as a disease‑modifying agent for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of leflunomide on PD. The PD model was established by administering 18 mg/kg of 1‑methyl‑4‑phenyl‑1,2,3,6‑tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) intraperitoneally for 5 consecutive days. Leflunomide was administered intraperitoneally at doses of 1, 5, and 10 mg/kg for 14 days. Motor and behavioral deficits were assessed using the rotarod test, locomotor activity assessment, hanging wire test, and pole test. MPTP administration impaired motor function and locomotor activity, and caused muscle weakness and bradykinesia. Leflunomide at a dose of 10 mg/kg mitigated the severity of motor deficits and muscle weakness. Furthermore, leflunomide at a dose of 10 mg/kg suppressed the MPTP‑induced elevation of interleukin‑2, interleukin‑6, and tumor necrosis factor‑alpha levels in the brain tissue. Similarly, leflunomide attenuated the increased expression of nuclear factor kappa B and inducible nitric oxide synthase caused by MPTP treatment. Moreover, leflunomide at a dose of 10 mg/kg preserved neuronal integrity and prevented the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase expression induced by MPTP administration. Based on our findings, leflunomide exhibited a beneficial effect on the MPTP‑induced PD model, potentially through modulation of anti‑inflammatory mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is among the most common neurodevelopmental conditions in humans. While public awareness of the challenges faced by individuals with autism is steadily increasing, the underlying causes of abnormalities observed in ASD remains incompletely understood. The autism spectrum is notably broad, with symptoms that can manifest in various forms and degrees of severity. Core features of ASD, such as communication difficulties, impaired social interactions, and restricted patterns of behavior, interests, and activities, are often accompanied by other co‑occurring conditions, such as anxiety. ASD affects individuals regardless of gender, race, or ethnicity. Although we are currently unable to pinpoint a single definitive cause of autism, it is clear that genetics play a crucial role in its development. The first genes associated with an increased risk for ASD were discovered in rare monogenic disorders, such as fragile X syndrome (FXS), caused by mutations in the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene, and macrocephaly, linked to mutations in the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge of ASD in patients with mutations in the FMR1 and PTEN genes.",

In 11 rats L-NAME reversed a pressor effect of brief hypercapnia induced by 10% CO2/air mixture (PaCO2 84.1 +/- 5 mm Hg) into a depressor response, reduced CBF response proportionally to the reduction of MAP and did not influence CVR response to CO2. In 5 rats L-NAME did not abolish the central pressor effect of a CO2-stimulus and significantly augmented CO2-induced vasodilatatory response in the cortex (43.4 +/- 24% before L-NAME and 137.8 +/- 38.8% after L-NAME) by a larger reduction of CVR (-11 +/- 8% before L-NAME and -47.1 +/- 7.6% after L-NAME). It is concluded that NO does not mediate the vasodilatatory effect of brief hypercapnia in the cortex. NO appears critical for the central pressor effect of CO2. In those rats in which the central pressor effect of a CO2-stimulus was not abolished by an NOS blocker, an increased CBF and augmented decrease in CVR was observed during brief hypercapnia. Possible mechanisms of this dual responsiveness of cortical blood flow and arterial blood pressure to CO2, induced by inhibition of NOS, are discussed.",

    "abstract": "We report the results of microdialysis experiments investigating the NMDA-induced release of intracellular Ca2+ in different brain regions. Microdialysis probes were implanted stereotaxically into the striatum, thalamus and hippocampus dentate gyrus (DG) of adult rats. Dialysates were analysed for alterations in the concentration of ionized Ca2+ in an initially calcium-free medium and for changes in 45Ca efflux from the pre-labelled endogenous Ca2+ pools. The application of 5 mM of NMDA to the dialysis medium for 20 min in the striatum, resulted in increases in Ca2+ and 45Ca concentrations by 25% and 35% respectively. After NMDA perfusion in the hippocampus DG and in the thalamus, decreases in the Ca2+ concentration to 65.6% and 38.6% of the basal level respectively, were accompanied by increases in 45Ca efflux, exceeding 1,500% of the basal level in the hippocampus. Cell swelling, and the corresponding reduction of the extracellular space volume was insufficient to explain the huge increase in 45Ca efflux. Thus, our experiments demonstrated that in vivo in the rat hippocampus DG, NMDA induces the release of 45Ca to the extracellular space from unidentified intracellular calcium stores.",

    "abstract": "The mediolateral distribution of neurones of origin of the corticovestibular projection from the cerebellar posterior lobe in the rabbit was studied with the retrograde horseradish peroxidase (HRP) tracing method. After iontophoretic injections confined to various subdivisions of the vestibular nuclear complex (VNC) labelled Purkinje neurones were found ipsilaterally in widespread mediolateral cortical regions of vermal lobules from VI to IX, as well as in crus I and crus II of the ansiform lobule, the copula pyramidis, lobule HV and the ventral paraflocculus. However, when projections from individual sublobules were examined, a clearly visible zonal pattern was found. Thus, Purkinje neurones projecting to VNC were arranged in longitudinal bands with medial and lateral boundaries quite well demarcated. These bands had a different width and were found to be located at different distances from the midline. The present findings constitute the first indication of a zonal organization of corticovestibular projections from individual sublobules of the cerebellar posterior lobe in the rabbit. This zonal arrangement of VNC afferents is discussed with the special emphasis on the cerebellar longitudinal zones and related to previous studies on other species.",

Two groups of single records (6 hand 24 h) and one group of repeated ones (6 h daily for three consecutive days) were analysed. Five levels of arousal (states) were distinguished on the basis of hippocampal and neocortical EEG: high arousal (HA), moderate arousal (MA), low arousal (LA), slow wave sleep (SWS) and paradoxical sleep (PS). The number of HVS episodes and the cumulative amount (i.e. summed duration) of each state was calculated for each successive hour of recording. It was found that the number of HVS episodes correlated positively with the amount of the MA state, but not with the amount of the remaining states. The rate of HVS occurrence during the MA state, however, was not stable. It decreased along with the decrease in amount of MA in successive recording hours of the same recording session. However, at the beginning of each successive session, the HVS episodes became more numerous, whereas the MA amount decreased. The accompanying changes in the cumulative amount of the remaining states confirm indirectly the supposition that HVS occurrence is related to transitions from one state to another rather than to a given state itself.",

We made detailed behavioral observations before, during and after the rotation on selected days to identify elements of the maternal behavioral repertoire vulnerable to 2G challenge. Licking and nest building were reduced during rotation while mothers sniffed and snouted their pups more. Nursing and total time in physical contact with pups were relatively stable. The effects of rotation were most pronounced on P2, dams appearing to habituate to the treatment with repeated exposure. Dam parity had a limited effect on the behavioral response to rotation, primiparous mothers tending to spend longer nursing their pups during the rotation and showing a greater tendency to lick and nest-build in post-rotation. Differences between parity groups diminished over days. Body weight was decreased in rotated primiparous dams and their pups gained less weight than stationary controls. Ultrasonic vocalization (USV) rates recorded on P2, P5 and P9 seemed to indicate delayed behavioral development in rotated pups.",

It was found that numerous granulocytes appeared in bacterial infections, but not in aseptic lesions of the brain. The young maturing blood cells and granulocytes demonstrate the subsequent stages in the development of the inflammatory reaction. The changes depend on the character of the injurious factor and the level of maturation of the CNS. The topography of maturing brain lesions due to infections and anoxic/ischemic damage was similar and localized most often in the periventricular white matter.",

    "abstract": "Background and Purpose: Ascorbic acid an antioxidant vitamin is found throughout the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). There is evidence that it may modulate neuronal activity, release of neurotransmitters and dopamine receptors activities. There are behavioral evidences supporting the antidopaminergic effect of ascorbic acid. This effect of ascorbic acid may in part modulates the stereotyped behaviors-induced by dopaminergic system. The purpose of the present study was to determine the interaction between ascorbic acid and the stereotyped licking behavior in rat. Materials and Methods: In the present study, effects of ascorbic acid and different dopamine receptor antagonists on apomorphine-induced licking behavior were examined. For the induction of licking, the dose of 0.5 mg/kg, s.c. of apomorphine was used and the number of licking was recorded over a 75 min period. Results: Ascorbic acid (200-350 mg/kg, s.c.) dose-dependently reduced the licking behavior. Subcutaneous injection of ascorbic acid (250 mg/kg, ED61) potentates the inhibitory effect of dopamine D1 receptor antagonist, SCH 23390 (0.5 and 1 mg/kg, i.p.) but did not alter the inhibitory effect of dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, sulpiride (25 and 50 mg/kg, s.c.). Conclusion: These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of ascorbic acid on apomorphine-induced licking behavior is mediated by dopamine D2 receptor mechanisms.",

Many factors such as daily life events, neurotransmitter systems, and different brain areas could influence anxiety behavior in humans and animals. For example, opioids and androgens decrease anxiety behavior both in humans and animals. Furthermore, removing the testes (gonadectomy) causes higher levels of anxiety-like behaviors, in which the administration of testosterone and opioid antagonist can reverse some of these behaviors. We review the effects of morphine and androgens on the modulation of anxiety behavior in gonadectomized animals. We begin by highlighting the effects of opioid drugs and androgens on the modulation of anxiety behavior that have been implicated in anxiety behavior. We then discuss the functional consequences of gonadectomy on anxiety behavior. Finally, we consider how the opioids and androgens may contribute to adaptive responses associated with anxiety.",

This “hypometabolic defect” results in congenital lactic acidosis and abnormalities of brain morphology and function, ranging from mild ataxia to profound psychomotor retardation. Our previous study showed reduction in total cell number and dendritic arbors in the cerebellar Purkinje cells in systemic PDC-deficient mice. Phenylbutyrate has been shown to increase PDC activity in cultured fibroblasts from PDC-deficient patients. Hence, we investigated the effects of postnatal (days 2-35) phenylbutyrate administration on the cerebellar Purkinje cell population in PDC-deficient female mice. Histological analyses of different regions of cerebellar cortex from the brain-specific PDC-deficient saline-injected mice revealed statistically significant reduction in the Purkinje cell density and increased cell size of the individual Purkinje cell soma compared to control PDC-normal, saline-injected group. Administration of phenylbutyrate to control mice did not cause significant changes in the Purkinje cell density and cell size in the studied regions. In contrast, administration of phenylbutyrate variably lessened the ill effects of PDC deficiency on Purkinje cell populations in different areas of the cerebellum.

    "abstract": "β-amyloid is an important factor in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. This study investigates β-amyloid's role in the regulation of nociception in mice. Pretreated once, 2 weeks prior to testing with β-amyloid, male ICR mice were examined on various nociceptive tests. Pretreatment with β-amyloid reversed the nociceptive effects induced by intraperitoneally administered acetic acid (writhing response) and intraplantar injection of 5% formalin into the hind paw. β-amyloid pretreatment also elevated the threshold for nociception in the mechanical von Frey test. Additionally, p-CREB and p-ERK levels in the spinal cord and the adrenal gland increased after formalin injection. Pretreatment with β-amyloid attenuated formalin‑induced overexpression of p-CREB and p-ERK in the spinal cord and the adrenal gland. Our results suggest that chemical and mechanical nociception appear to be altered in β-amyloid-treated animals. Furthermore, the reduction of nociception by β-amyloid in the formalin pain model appears to be mediated, at least in part, by the suppression of p-CREB and p-ERK level in the spinal cord and the adrenal gland.",

Angiogenesis, which was assessed using angiomaps, showed that the area of vessels in the ischemic center increased until day 7. OCT imaging revealed a heterogeneous scattering signal pattern in the ischemic area. On structural OCT images, we found presence of a core area of ischemia with a hyporeflective OCT signal and a halo of hyperreflective signal around the core. The core signal decreased in size by 70% by day 14. Immunocytochemistry revealed that the hyporeflective area in the ischemic core was associated with microglia/macrophage activation, whereas the hyperreflective signal from the halo came from activated astrocytes.",

Firstly, N2a cells were exposed in the condition of oxygen and glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) to construct a model of cerebral I/R in vitro. MTT assay was employed to access the effects of PRP in N2a cell OGD/R injury. Then, we evaluated the role of the expression of miR‑223, progestin and adipoQ receptors 3 (PAQR3) and autophagy markers in the neuroprotective effect of PRP by qPCR and western blot. And the effect of miR‑223/PAQR3 axis regulated autophagy in the neuroprotection of PRP was verified by overexpressing miR‑223 and PAQR3. Finally, the interaction between miR‑223 and PAQR3 was analyzed by the luciferase reporter gene. The results showed that after OGD/R treatment of N2a cells, the expression of miR‑223 increased and the expression of PAQR3 and autophagy decreased. PRP improved cells damage caused by OGD/R in N2a cell, and reduced the expression of miR‑223 in cells, increased PAQR3 and autophagy. The luciferase reporter assay was used to prove that miR‑223 could target PAQR3 directly. Overexpression of miR‑223 could eliminate the improvement effect of PRP on OGD/R cells, but at the same time, overexpression of PAQR3 restored the protection of PRP from cell damage. Our research found that in the OGD/R injury in vitro model, PRP inhibited the expression of miR‑223 and enhanced autophagy to attenuate the injury by increasing the expression of PAQR3.",

An epileptic focus was produced by injection of penicillin G potassium (500 units) into the somatomotor cortex. After the epileptiform activity reached maximum frequency and amplitude; nimodipine was injected into the same area. Application of nimodipine caused an inhibition in the electrocorticograms (ECoG).

Presented results show that DTI of the spinal cord, perfused with formalin 10 minutes after the injury, can detect changes in water diffusion in white matter (WM) and in gray matter (GM), in areas extending well beyond the region of direct impact. Histology of neurons of the GM shows changes that can be attributed to ischemia. This is in agreement with the observed decrease of diffusion in the injured regions, which may be attributed to the cytotoxic edema due to ischemia. However, the diffusion changes in highly anisotropic WM seem to be caused by a direct action of mechanical force of impact, which significantly distorts the nerve fibers.",

The intra-common carotid artery injection of NMDA (4 mg/kg) induced transient expiratory apnea followed by a brief and variably occurring period of breathing at reduced tidal volume. There were no consistent changes in respiratory rate in rats subjected to midcervical vagotomy alone. Supranodose vagotomy exerted no effect on NMDA-induced respiratory arrest, whereas CSNs' section or blockade of NMDA receptors with AP-7 abolished the apnea. These results indicate that the apnea induced by intraarterial NMDA challenge is due to activation of peripheral NMDA receptors and is mediated via carotid body afferents.",

However, the possibility of an overall change in EEG oscillatory activity during expectancy periods has not been directly addressed. The present report tests whether the background oscillatory activity is modulated by a warning signal. During the expectancy period, the power spectral density (PSD) between 0 and 42.9 Hz &amp;#150; including delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma &amp;#150; decreased with respect to the baseline. These results suggest that during expectancy periods there is a generalised decrease in the oscillatory activity, and that reduction of the EEG power would facilitate the phasic and oscillatory neural activities triggered by the next target stimulus.",

    "abstract": "The stability of human upright posture determines the range and dynamics of movements performed. Consequently, the repertoire and quality of the movements performed by a dancer are mainly determined by the efficiency of postural control. This is of particular importance in professional dance training that should focus on shaping optimal movement‑posture interaction. To get a deeper insight into this problem, the impact of the training on postural sway characteristics during quiet stance was analyzed in 16 female students in the seventh grade of a ballet school and compared with the size‑ and age‑matched group of secondary school students. Center of pressure trajectories were recorded for 25.6 s while standing quiet with eyes open (EO) and then with eyes closed (EC). The assessment of postural control was based on novel normalized sway parameters including sway vector (SV), sway anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) directional indices (DIAP and DIML), and sway ratios (SRAP and SRML). The results document a significant contribution of vision to postural stability control in ballet students, which seems to compensate for training‑related changes in joint mobility and altered activity ranges of the legs' muscles. In the control group standing with EC, SV amplitude increased only by 18% whereas in the ballet students tested in the same conditions, the increase exceeded 72%. Under full control of standing posture (EO test), the training‑related increase of leg muscle forces allows dancers to maintain balance with lesser effort as documented here by 21% reduced SRAP. Additionally, the dancers while tested with their EC exhibited a 12% increase in the anteroposterior sway with a concomitant reduction of the mediolateral sway. The resulting changes in the postural control asymmetry were documented by both DIAP/DIML and SV azimuth. In conclusion, our novel analysis of postural sway seems a useful tool in monitoring the effects of training as well as the proper course of postural control development in children and adolescents.",

C57BL/6 J mice were divided into two groups: MS and control. The MS group was subdivided into sham (MS) and MS+HP. After the EAE induction treatment protocol, the patterns of miRNA expression profiles were determined in brain samples of the groups.

These miRNAs have been suggested as biomarkers of MS because they are highly correlated with the pathology of the disease. Furthermore, miRNA array analysis identified five candidate miRNAs (miR‑299a‑5p, miR‑206‑3p, miR‑325‑5p, miR‑10b‑5p, miR‑429‑3p) that are highly likely to be associated with MS pathogenesis, which could be helpful in the diagnosis and treatment of MS disease.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND METHODS. The carotid body is a paired chemosensory organ that responds to changes in the chemical stimuli in the arterial blood and reflexly, through the brain stem respiratory areas, adjust pulmonary ventilation to the current metabolic requirements. The hyperventilatory response to hypoxia is the prime example of the powerful carotid body function (1). The underlying cellular mechanisms of this function are elusive and are under a heated debate. In a previous study we found that phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) is present in the ex vivo normoxic carotid body and is elaborated in the hypoxic carotid body (2). One of the downstream signaling molecules, capable of triggering the cellular responses, activated by PLC-induced diacylglicerol is protein kinase C (PKC) (3). In this study we followed up this line of research and set out to establish the presence of PKC in the carotid body. We employed immunofluorescent light microscopy. Carotid bodies were dissected from anesthetized and perfused through the aorta cats. Six micrometer cryostat sections of the tissue were processed immunohistochemically, first with isoform-specific monoclonal mouse anti-PKC antibodies followed by secondary polyclonal anti-mouse antibody conjugated with a fluorophore. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. We found that aPKC and hPKC isoforms were expressed in the carotid chemoreceptor cells. Fig. 1 shows immunofluorescent staining in the clusters of these cells. Other PKC isoforms such as tPKC was expressed explicitly in the endothelial and perithelial cells. Other isoforms such as P, y, 6, or p were interspersed in other structural elements of the organ. This study centers attention on the presence of specific PKC isoforms in the carotid chemoreceptor cells. That presence along with the elaboration of molecular activators of PKC by hypoxia (2) raises a reasonable assumption that the enzyme might have a part in the cellular transductive pathway incoming chemical stimuli into increased afferent impulse traffic in the nerve endings apposed synaptically to the chemoreceptor cells. The exact role of PKC in the carotid body function and the determinants of this role remain to be established.",

Approximately one month later they received additional training at the rate of 30 trials per day for 11 days (330 trials), during which acquisition of inhibition of delay was studied. Animals of the Syracuse High Avoidance (SHA/Bru) strain reached an asymptote of nearly 100% of avoidance responses (AVRs) by trial of 30 of original training, whereas those of a Low Avoidance (SLA/Bru) strain remained at nearly 0 AVRs. During subsequent extended training the SHA/Bru animals remained at 95–100% AVRs. By the end of extended training males of the SLA/Bru strain had approached 40% AVRs, the females 25% AVRs. SHA/Bru animals of both sexes showed a progressive increase in the relative frequency of long latency AVRs, indicating the development of inhibition of delay. In contrast, animals of the SLA/Bru strain, especially the males, showed a progressive increase in the relative frequency of short latency AVRs, presumably reflecting the continued acquisition of the avoidance response. These results are interpreted in terms of two-process theory of avoidance learning and in terms of the development of temporal conditioning or learning as a result of differential extinction of conditioned fear.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND METHODS. A strong tendency not to return to the previously shocked compartment of a shuttle box was proposed as the main factor retarding two-way avoidance learning (1). It has been shown that the fly-away. rapid escape from an electrified grid. a species-specific defensive reaction of the rat. was observed at the very beginning of avoidance training. Subsequently latencies of the escape response increased. reflecting the conflict situation (2). Here, the modulatory role of a darkness (D) stimulus on the fly-away escape response is studied. Three groups each of 25 experimentally naive male rats were trained under unsignalled escape (Esc), signalled escape (Esc-D). or avoidance (Av-D) procedures. Only shock was presented in Esc, compound shock and darkness in Esc-D, and darkness preceded for 5 s and then accompanied shock in Av-D. The nominal 1.6-mA scrambled pulsed DC shock (50 Hz pulse rate) on the grid floor could be terminated (escaped) by running to the opposite compartment or prevented (avoided) by the same response during the signal-shock interval. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. The first escape latency was shortest in the Esc-D and longest in Av-D groups (P<0.05. Kolmogorov-Smimov test: Fig. 1A). Simultaneous presentation of D and shock, presumably enhanced the fly-away escape response because of the higher energizing role of a compound. In contrast, the initial presentation of D in the delayed CS-US contingency may elicit an orienting reflex which interferes with the fly-away reaction. The gradual dissipation of group differences with continued presentation of the stimuli (Fig. 1B) supports this conclusion. During the first 10 trials there were no reliable changes in escape latencies in groups Esc-D or Esc. In contrast, curvilinear changes were revealed in group Av-D: the escape latency on trial 1 was longer than on trials 2. 5. and 6, whereas the escape latency on trials 5 and 6 were shorter than on each of trials 8, 9, and 10 (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Ps<0.05). The mean frequency of avoidance responses during these trials was small (0.024ltrial). An even earlier increase in escape latency using the avoidance procedure was found with a more salient warning signal (3). Thus. differing from these escape procedures, the avoidance procedure induced the lengthening of escape latencies as early as the first 10 trials of training.",

The test procedure is based on the piezo-electric principle and was evaluated using the tremorogenic compound reserpine and the stereotypies-inducing drug apomorphine. Whereas for reserpine an orderly and dose-related increase in activity was observed, no such effect was detected with apomorphine. In order to further evaluate the test procedure, studies on the antagonism of reserpine- induced tremor were also performed. Results from these studies indicated that the DA-agonist lisuride, but not the S2-antagonist ritanserin, were able to antagonize the reserpine-induced tremor in a dose-related manner.",

B. terrestris (but not B. pascuorum) also performed better in darkness than in tubes exposed to sunlight. This implies that in both situations B. terrestris showed higher readiness to dig than B. pascuorum, and that in tubes exposed to sunlight only B. terrestris showed high readiness to display photopositive behaviour as well. B. pascuorum displayed, however, photopositive behaviour in another escape situation: when released in a dark room in front of a vertical array of four sources of white light. In that situation, B. pascuorum also displayed the tendency to fly upwards, based most probably on responses to gravitational cues.",

Thirty-nine out of a total one hundred neurones could be classified as bidirectional neurones with both descending and ascending collaterals. In the remaining cases only long descending projections to spinal segments were found. Comparison of conduction velocities measured in descending branches revealed no significant differences between individual neurones. On the other hand, descending collaterals of double direction neurones conducted impulses considerably faster than their axonal branches ascending to LRN. Our results suggest that parallel transmission of information to various, spinal or supraspinal centres of the nervous system is more common than reported before.",

The Nand C cats learned slowly. The learning was slower than in previously studied discriminations of stationary stimuli. However, all N and C cats mastered the detection task and except one C cat the direction task. In contrast, 4 BD cats failed in the detection task and all in the direction task. This result is consistent with single-cell recording data showing impairment of direction analysis in the visual system in BD cats. After completing the training the upper part of the middle suprasylvian sulcus was removed unilaterally in 7 cats and bilaterally in 6 cats. Surprisingly, the unilateral lesions were more effective: the clear-cut retention deficits were found in 5 cats lesioned unilaterally, whereas only in one cat lesioned bilaterally.",

    "abstract": "The olfactory bulb was stimulated by trains of electrical pulses in freely moving rats. Evoked responses resembling damped oscillations at the gamma frequency of 30-60 Hz were recorded in the anterior and posterior piriform cortex. Different types of unconditioned sniffing were induced by stimulation of the olfactory bulb. They were similar to those evoked by an odorant (amylacetate) but differed from the behavioral patterns evoked by non-olfactory (auditory) stimulation. Rats were trained to avoid foot-shocks following electrical pulses into the olfactory bulb as conditioned stimulus in a two way shuttle-box paradigm. Threshold electrical intensities for inducing evoked responses in piriform cortex, unconditioned behavior, and learned avoidance were compared. Thresholds for unconditioned and conditioned behavior were significantly higher in comparison with those for evoking gamma discharges in anterior and posterior piriform cortex. The results suggest that fast time-locked synchronization in the gamma range in the piriform cortex induced by synaptic input from theolfactory bulb is not sufficient for inducing corresponding behavior. Thus behavioral detection and probably also olfactory recognition do not seem to be direct consequences of this fast time-locked neural synchronization. Additional neuronal processes that are connected with further elevation of stimulation intensity seem to be necessary for that.",

Seventeen patients who had undergone a unilateral temporal lobectomy for the relief of intractable epilepsy (8 subjects--left hemisphere damage, 9 subjects--right hemisphere damage) and 11 normal control subjects with no brain damage were tested. The subjects were presented with geometrical Vanderplas type figures exposed in pairs, each for 100 ms, one after another, with short (50 ms and 500 ms) and long (3,000 ms) interstimulus intervals (ISI). The task of the subjects was to judge whether the second stimulus was the same as, smaller or bigger than the first one. The first stimulus in each pair was exposed unilaterally, randomly in the left (LVF) or right (RVF) visual field, and the second one in the centre of the screen. In short ISI conditions the RH-damaged group performed worse than both the control group and the LH-damaged group. In long ISI conditions the RH-damaged group did not differ from the controls. On the contrary the LH-damaged group did not differ significantly from the controls in any ISI condition. The results show that temporal lobe structures are involved in time limited storage of sensory information. Moreover, they provide further evidence for the right-hemispheric locus of this storage.",

    "abstract": "Influences exerted by tactile stimuli on the muscle activity were investigated with two methods: (1) analysis of kinematics and electromyographic (EMG) activity of eight forelimb muscles during contact placing (CP) reactions elicited by tactile stimuli applied to the dorsal, medial or lateral sides of the paw in cats, and (2) the Hoffmann (H)-reflex technique to quantify the effects of the tactile stimuli on the excitability of the alpha motoneurones of the soleus muscle in awake rats. The first group of the data showed that the tactile stimuli applied to dorsal, medial or lateral aspects of the paw led to different strategies of the forelimb movements during CP reactions. These differences arose from various patterns of activation of the elbow flexor and extensor muscles at the beginning of CP reactions and a various involvement of the medio-lateral components of movements, depending on the site of the tactile stimulus application. With the H-reflex technique it was found that the tactile stimulus diminished the excitability of alpha motoneurones of the soleus muscle when applied to the skin overlying the lateral side of the ankle joint. This effect was in line with the observation that the tactile stimulus applied to the lateral side of the paw activated the elbow flexor muscles but not their antagonists to initiate CP reaction.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the effect of a mental content of presented stimuli, normal aging and individual differences in cognitive abilities on temporal limits of an integration mechanism. Younger and older subjects grouped together the beats generated by a metronome. Subjects were asked to listen to the beats of a metronome and to accentuate mentally every second, third, fourth... etc. beat, to create a subjective rhythm. This rhythm exists, in fact, only in subjects' mind and not objectively. Subjects reported verbally how many clicks they were able to integrate into a perceptual unit. On this basis, the time interval during which subjects were able to integrate temporally separated stimuli was calculated (number of beats reported as being integrated x time distance between beats) for different metronome frequencies. The results show, firstly, that the length of integration periods significantly depends on the frequency of presented metronome beats. When the frequency of metronome beats is high, the time interval during which the subjects integrate beats into a single perceptual unit is shorter. Secondly, older adults integrate information during a longer time interval than younger ones. Thirdly, the length of an integration period is related to a subjects' level of cognitive ability. These results suggest that the length of an integration period is not a constant, stable feature, but varies across the life span depending on the mental content of the information presented and individual factors.",

    "abstract": "In a previous study we have provided evidence, that acute experimental hypercapnia due to hypoventilation in the rabbit alters blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier function in the brain (Pakulski et al. 1998). The purpose of this study therefore was to determine if lidocaine would prevent the observed alterations in the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier function. The experiments were conducted in 16 adult Chinchilla rabbits submitted to acute hypercapnia due to mechanical hypoventilation (PaCO2 between 8-9.5 kPa over 180 minutes) under pentobarbital anaesthesia. The studied group (n = 8) was treated by lidocaine infusion 10 mg kg-1 h-1. After 180 minutes of hypercapnia the value of cerebrospinal fluid-blood index of gentamycin concentration, indicating the permeability of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, was significantly lower in animals treated with lidocaine (4.03 +/- 2.32 vs. 19.05 +/- 5.49; P < 0.01). We conclude that lidocaine may attenuate the increase of blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier permeability under conditions of experimental acute hypercapnia lasting 180 minutes in the mechanically ventilated rabbit.",

    "abstract": "Stimulation of the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) causes a potentiation of hypoglossal nerve activity persisting after cessation of stimulation. The mechanism of this phenomenon is uncertain. We investigated a potential role of the nitric oxide (NO) pathway in modulation of the after-effects of SLN stimulation on phrenic and hypoglossal activity in rabbits. L-Arginine, a substrate for NO synthesis and NG-Nitro-L-Arginine (L-NNA) an inhibitor of NO synthase (NOS), were administered systemically. L-Arginine and L-NNA alone caused small changes in respiratory activity. During pre-treatment with NO precursor the amplitude and duration of hypoglossal potentiation evoked by SLN stimulation were reduced. Systemic NO synthase inhibition partially reversed these effects of L-Arginine. The results showed that interference with NO production by NO substrate and NOS inhibitor modulates the effects of SLN stimulation on hypoglossal activity. Nitric oxide might be a negative modulator of the transmission of short-term potentiation (STP) in ypoglossal activity.",

    "abstract": "Visual field impairment affects more than 100 million people globally. However, due to the lack of the access to appropriate ophthalmic healthcare in undeveloped regions as a result of associated costs and expertise this number may be an underestimate. Improved access to affordable diagnostic software designed for visual field examination could slow the progression of diseases, such as glaucoma, allowing for early diagnosis and intervention. We have developed Specvis, a free and open-source application written in Java programming language that can run on any personal computer to meet this requirement (http://www.specvis.pl/). Specvis was tested on glaucomatous, retinitis pigmentosa and stroke patients and the results were compared to results using the Medmont M700 Automated Static Perimeter. The application was also tested for inter-test intrapersonal variability. The results from both validation studies indicated low inter-test intrapersonal variability, and suitable reliability for a fast and simple assessment of visual field impairment. Specvis easily identifies visual field areas of zero sensitivity and allows for evaluation of its levels throughout the visual field. Thus, Specvis is a new, reliable application that can be successfully used for visual field examination and can fill the gap between confrontation and perimetry tests. The main advantages of Specvis over existing methods are its availability (free), affordability (runs on any personal computer), and reliability (comparable to high-cost solutions).",

    "abstract": "Response generalization to a novel stimulus occurs when the new stimulus shares common features with the stimulus used in the original learning. Given the many recent studies suggesting that the perirhinal cortex is critical for disambiguating stimuli that share representational/perceptual elements, we hypothesize that lesions sustained to this region would attenuate response generalization. In the first part of this experiment lesioned and control rats learned a feature-ambiguous tactual discrimination task until they had all reached the same level of performance. In this task animals were asked to discriminate among 3 tactual stimuli simultaneously exposed in 3 arms of a 4-arm plus-shaped maze. In the second part of this experiment, the same rats were given a generalization test 24 h after acquisition of the tactual discrimination. In the generalization test the original tactual stimulus associated with reward during the learning of the discrimination was replaced by a novel tactual stimulus while the other two remained the same. Of the 3 stimuli used in the generalization test, the novel stimulus had the highest degree of feature overlap with respect to the original target stimulus used during the learning of the discrimination. The generalization test took place over two consecutive days, with 8 trials each day. On the first day of generalization, the results indicated that the lesioned rats generalized significantly worse than the control rats during the first 4 trials, but not during the last 4 trials. On the second day of generalization, however, both groups performed the test perfectly. These findings suggest that, in addition to the well-known mnesic function in object processing, the perirhinal cortex may also be involved in perceptual functions.",

    "abstract": "The dorsal periaqueductal grey (DPAG) is a midbrain region that plays a fundamental role on the expression of the anxiety and fear-related responses. Increased fear and anxiety levels are the most frequent symptoms present in the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. This study aims to assess whether GABA and opioid receptors of the DPAG could be implicated in the expression of the conditioned fear state elicited in alcohol withdrawn-rats. For this purpose, we used the fear-potentiated startle (FPS) procedure. Drugs used were the selective GABA(A) agonist muscimol (1 nmol/0.2 microL) and the predominantly mu opiate receptors agonist morphine (10 nmol/0.2 microL). Exposure to aversive cues of the elevated-plus-maze (EPM) was used in order to validate the influence of alcohol withdrawal on emotionality. Data from FPS pointed out to an anxiogenic-like profile of withdrawal, a result sustained by the data collected from the EPM test. Muscimol and morphine showed their well-known anxiolytic-like profile, decreasing the fear-potentiated startle (FPS) amplitude in control subjects. However, the drugs had no effect on the levels of fear evoked in rats pre-treated with and withdrawn from alcohol. It is suggested that this lack of effect was possibly due to the desensitization of the GABA(A) receptors, as well as by the decrease on the responsiveness of the functions of mu-opioid receptors, resulting from chronic administration of ethyl alcohol. These findings shed light on some aspects of the anxiety-like behavior elicited during alcohol withdrawal bringing new information on the influence of GABA and opioid receptors of the DPAG on the expression of unconditioned and conditioned fear responses.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the MMP inhibitor GM6001 in a rat model of S. pneumoniae meningitis. For these experiments, 7-day-old Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided into an uninfected group, meningitis group, antibiotic group and GM6001+antibiotic group. Uninfected animals were sham infected with sterile saline. Rats in the other three groups were inoculated with S. pneumonia and left untreated, treated with ceftriaxone, or treated with ceftriaxone combined with GM6001. Rats in the meningitis group were severely ill, and MMP-9 was significantly up-regulated. The change in brain water content was consistent with the MMP-9 level. A significant loss of neurons and impaired learning function were observed in the meningitis group. Treatment with the antibiotic and GM6001 significantly down-regulated the level of MMP-9, decreased the brain water content, attenuated neuronal injury and improved learning. Conclusions: GM6001 protected the brain from damage caused by S. pneumoniae, and this effect may occur via downregulating MMP-9 and decreasing brain water content.",

In all the experiments the amplitude of late components of evoked potentials was significantly reduced, while early components remained unaffected. These findings indicate that cortical cells are inhibited by acetylcholine (ACh). Furthermore, combined application of a muscarinic receptor blocker (atropine) and GAL reliably suppressed the effects of galanthamine. These observations suggest that ACh-induced inhibition may be mediated by activation of GABAergic interneurones that possess muscarinic receptors.",

The present analysis of choice strategies used by rats was performed to detect possible correlates between patterns of responding and duration of learning. The following strategies were included into the analysis: perseveration and alternation of choice (response-set hypotheses), win-stay lose-shift and win-shift lose-stay (prediction hypotheses). A computer programme called \"The Thinking Rat\" was written to analyse rat strategies during the learning. The analysis was applied for two irrelevant dimensions of stimuli, i.e. position and orientation, and for colour as a relevant cue. SHR solved the task using different strategies than the NT rats. All subjects began by responding to position as a cue, but SHR gave up this strategy more quickly than NT rats did and responded earlier to colour. NT rats showed a strong preference to persevere in their choices with respect to stimulus position, whereas SHR used more frequently the prediction hypotheses with respect to colour. The analysis of performance and the analysis of choice strategies-could indicate that the discrepancy in learning between SHR and NT rats may be caused by differences in attention.",

The visual cue presented in shock compartment amplifies the behavioral tendency actually prevailing in the response repertory of the rat. During the 1st session the compound enhanced the species-specific flight resulting in shortening of the rat's escape latency. Thereafter, during subsequent sessions, darkness exaggerated resistance to enter the other compartment; thus escape latencies were longer under compounded than under unsignalled procedure. The darkness cue reduces the intertrial response rate relative to the unsignalled group. This latter finding supports the discrimination model of the effect, since the compound helps the animals to discriminate the illuminated \"safe\" period between trials from the aversive shock period. Our data seem to suggest that the darkness presented synchronously with escapable grid-shock acquires aversive properties.",

Brain glycogen mass undergoes compensatory expansion post-recovery from insulin-induced hypoglycemia (IIH). Current research utilized combinatory high-resolution microdissection/high-sensitivity Western blotting to investigate whether IIH causes residual adjustments in glycogen metabolism within the metabolic-sensory ventrolateral VMN (VMNvl). Micropunch-dissected tissue was collected from rostral, middle, and caudal levels of the VMNvl in each sex for analysis of glycogen synthase (GS) and glycogen phosphorylase (GP)-muscle type (GPmm; norepinephrine-sensitive) and GP-brain type (GPbb; glucoprivic-sensitive) isoform expression during and after IIH. Hypoglycemic suppression of VMNvl GS levels in males disappeared or continued after reestablishment of euglycemia, according to sampled segment. Yet, reductions in female VMNvl GS persisted after IIH. Males exhibited reductions in GPmm content in select rostro-caudal VMNvl segments, but this protein declined in each segment post-hypoglycemia. Females, rather, showed augmented or diminished GPmm levels during IIH, but no residual effects of IIH on this protein. In each sex, region-specific up-or down-regulation of VMNvl GPbb profiles during glucose decrements were undetected post-recovery from IIH. Results provide novel proof of estradiol-dependent sex-dimorphic patterns of VMNvl GP variant expression at specific rostro-caudal levels of this critical gluco-regulatory structure. Sex differences in persistence of IIH-associated GS and GPmm patterns of expression after restoration of euglycemia infer that VMNvl recovery from this metabolic stress may involve dissimilar glycogen accumulation in male versus female.",

This study investigates the relationship between cerebral hypoperfusion and WM total volume changes by assessing the trends in CBF and WM changes by meta‑analysis. In this meta‑analysis, the differences in CBF were compared according to cerebral hypoperfusion type and the effect of cerebral hypoperfusion on the total volume of WM changes in rodents. Using subgroup analysis, 13 studies were evaluated for comparing CBF according to the type of cerebral hypoperfusion; 12 studies were evaluated for comparing the effects of cerebral hypoperfusion on the total volume of WM changes. Our meta‑analysis shows that the total volume of WM decreases with a decrease in CBF. However, the reduction in\\r\\nthe total volume of WM was greater in normal aging mice than in the cerebral hypoperfusion model mice. These results suggest that the reduction of cerebral WM volume during the aging process is affected by other factors in addition to a decrease in CBF.",

In this study, 18 transgenic mice with amyloid precursor protein (APP) /presenilin‑1 (PS1) were randomized into the Aβ3‑10‑KLH vaccine, Aβ1‑42 vaccine, and phosphate‑buffered saline (PBS) groups. The mice were injected at different time points. The Morris water maze test was used to identify the spatial learning and memory abilities of the mice. Immunohistochemistry was done to examine the Aβ, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and transmembrane protein 119 (TMEM119). Correspondingly, enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was done to measure interleukin (IL) ‑1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ‑α in the brain of transgenic mice. The Morris water maze results showed that both the Aβ3‑10‑KLH vaccine and the Aβ1‑42 peptide vaccine could improve the cognitive function of APP/PS1 transgenic mice significantly. Aβ3‑10‑KLH and Aβ1‑42 inoculations reduced Aβ load and suppressed astrocytes and microglia proliferation in the cortex compared with the PBS group. While there was no significant difference between the two groups, Aβ3‑10‑KLH and Aβ1‑42 vaccines decreased the brain levels of IL‑1β and TNF‑α as compared with the PBS group, but without difference between the two vaccines. In conclusion, early immunotherapy with an Aβ vaccine reduces the activation of glial cells and deposition of Aβ plaque in the brain of transgenic mice.",

The specific binding of 3HDHA to duck cerebral cortical membranes was found to be rapid, stable, saturable, reversible, and of high affinity. Saturation analysis resulted in a linear Scatchard plot suggesting binding to a single class of receptor binding sites with high affinity (Kd = 1.18 nM) and high capacity (Bmax = 162 fmol/mg protein). Competition studies showed the following relative rank order of potency of various compounds to inhibit the 3HDHA binding: antagonists ­ICI 118,551 &gt; S(-)-propranolol &gt;&gt; betaxolol, yohimbine, WB-4101, prazosin, mianserine; agonists - isoprenaline approximately equal to fenoterol&gt; salbutamol &gt;&gt; clonidine, phenylephrine. The obtained data suggest that in duck cerebral cortex beta-adrenergic receptors (like those described in brains of chick and pigeon) are of the beta2 subtype. This is in contrast to what has been reported for the mammalian brain, where - among beta-adrenoceptors - the beta1 subtype is predominant.",

    "abstract": "The early phase of development of muscles stops following the disappearance of embryonic and neonatal myosin and the elimination of polyneuronal innervation of muscle fibres with the formation of motor units (MUs), but later the muscle mass still considerably increases. It is unknown whether the three types are visible among newly formed MUs soon after the early postnatal period and whether their proportion is similar to that in adult muscle. Moreover, the processes responsible for MU-force regulation by changes in motoneuronal firing rate as well as properties of motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) during maturation are unknown. Three groups of Wistar rats were investigated - 1 month old, 2 months old and the adult, 9 months old. The basic contractile properties and action potentials of MUs in the medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle were analysed. The three types of MUs were distinguishable in all age groups, but higher proportion of slow MUs was noticed in young rats (29%, 18% and 11% in 1, 2 and 9 months rats, respectively). The fatigue index for fast fatigable MUs in 1 month old rats was about 2 times higher than in 9 months old rats. The twitch time parameters of fast MUs were shortened during the maturation; for these units, the force-frequency curves in young rats were shifted towards lower frequencies, which suggested that fast motoneurons of young animals generate lower firing rates. Higher twitch-to-tetanus ratios noted for the three MU types in young rats suggested the smaller role of rate coding in force regulation processes, and the higher role of MU recruitment in young rats. No significant differences in MUAP parameters between two groups of young and adult animals were observed. Concluding, the maturation process evokes deeper changes in fast MUs than in slow ones.",

    "abstract": "The ability to process multi-digit numbers is an essential skill which we investigated using a number decision task. Subjects were asked to decide whether a target number (e.g., 649) is too small or too large to be the mean between two delimiter numbers that constituted the interval (e.g., 567 and 715). Three-digit numbers were presented vertically with (1) growing interval sizes (i.e., distance between the two delimiters; e.g., interval size between 567 and 715 is 148) and target gap to the mean (e.g., the gap between the ‘real’ mean 641 and the target 649 is 8) and (2) growing interval sizes with constant gap to the mean (i.e., for each interval size the gap between target and mean was held constant). The results showed that target gap to the mean “masked” the influence of interval sizes, i.e., subjects’ performance improved with increasing interval sizes (distance effect). This effect was reversed when constant target gaps to the mean and growing interval sizes were presented. These results were replicated presenting the numbers horizontally and with two-digit numbers. Additionally, a significant influence of decade but no effect of unit compatibility on reaction times and error rates, on number magnitude (size effect) and response format was found. Overall, we showed that the number decision task is an efficient tool to investigate multidigit number representation and the results from the experiments revealed evidence for a hybrid model of multi-digit number representation in which numbers are represented as a whole but also on separate mental number lines that interact with each other.",

Two new and original contributions of Konorski are presented in detail, his theory of the motivational processes and the organization of the sensory systems in the brain. Those two contributions are then incorporated in the revised theory of the classical and type II conditioned reflexes which constitutes the core of the book. Conclusions point out at some of the ideas which remained valuable for the present day neuroscientists.",

Lentivirus encoding A53T alpha-synuclein (6 x 2.5 microliter) was stereotaxically injected into the substantia nigra of six adult female Gottingen minipigs. Contralateral control injections encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were performed. Gait-analysis was performed pre- and postoperatively. PCR of the transgenes and immunohistochemical staining against alpha-synuclein, EGFP, GFAP and TH was performed after 20 weeks. Gait analysis revealed a significant increase in step length and height, and a decrease in the double stand phase. PCR verified the mesencephalic presence of transgenes. IHC analysis showed alpha-synuclein expression in nigral neurons, around the injection tract and in related nigrostriatal projections. The alpha-synuclein positive neurons appeared swollen and vacuolated, in contrast to the EGFP-injected control side. To transduct all nigrostriatal cells with few microinjections, wider dissemination of the transgene must be achieved.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND METHODS. Increasing evidence indicates that the intrabrain vasopressinergic system plays an essential role in regulation of the cardiovascular system. Previous findings have provided evidence that centrally applied vasopressin (AVP) may produce both pressor-tachycardiac and hypotensive-bradycardiac responses, acting through V1 receptors located in circumventricular organs (1, 3). It has been shown previously that hemorrhage increases the intrabrain release of vasopressin. In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) the intracerebral level of AVP is decreased compared to their maternal strain Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) (2). The present study reports that in WKY rats intraventricular administration of AVP during hemorrhage elicits tachycardia and reduces hypotension. Male, 12-14 week-old WKY rats, were used for the experiment. The rats were subjected to the two surgical procedures performed under chloride hydrate anesthesia (360 mg/kg i.p.). During the first surgery a cannula was implanted into the left cerebral ventricle (LCV) (1). After the recovery period of 6 days, the abdominal aorta was catheterized for blood pressure measurements and blood withdrawal. The experiments were performed on freely moving rats one day after the catheterization (1). Animals were divided into two groups: control group (n = 6) subjected to LCV infusion of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (5 l/h, aCSF), and experimental group (n = 6) subjected to LCV infusion of AVP (100 ng/h). After 40 min of LCV infusion the arterial hemorrhage was performed (1.3% of body weight, 2.5 ml/min) (1). Mean arterial blood pressures was recorded during initial 40 and 30 min after the hemorrhage. Heart rate (HR) was calculated from the heart rate period (HRp). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. Under control conditions the WKY rats subjected to LCV infusion of aCSF responded with nonsignificant changes of HR (Fig. 1 A) which were associated with a significant decrease of blood pressure (Fig.1 B). In contrast, the animals receiving LCV infusion of AVP manifested a significant increase of HR (Fig. 1 A) and only slight change of MAP (Fig. 2 B). However, the difference of MAP was insignificant between groups. Lack of difference in changes of MAP between control and AVP groups in presence of significant increase of HR in the latter group indicates that the intrabrain AVP may potently modulate hemodynamic adjustment to hemorrhage. It appears that excessive fall in blood pressure in AVP experiments is to great extent prevented by improvement of cardiac output while in control experiments it is achieved mainly by an increase of the peripheral resistance. Therefore it is likely that the subpressor dose of AVP may promote enhanced activation of the cardiac component of the sympathetic system during hemorrhage. Acta Neurobiol.

    "abstract": "Storage of experience, including learning and memory, is thought to involve plasticity within pre-existing brain circuits. One model for looking at experience-dependent changes is environmental enrichment (EE), which involves exposing animals to a complex novel environment. Animals exposed to EE have previously been shown to exhibit a variety of behavioural and structural alterations in the brain, including decreased stress, improved learning and memory, altered levels of immediate early genes and synaptic change in the visual cortex. We were interested in understanding what regions of the brain are activated during the initial stages of EE. We used fos-tau-lacZ (FTL) transgenic mice to examine changes in functional activation throughout the brain after a single exposure to EE. We found that there was a significant increase in FTL expression within particular morphologically identified neurons in a series of brain regions in the enriched group compared to control groups, indicating that multiple circuits were activated. These regions include the claustrum, infralimbic cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and the hypothalamus. The data suggest that EE stimulates an initial strong increase in activation of multiple functional circuits. These circuits are presumably involved in the initial response of the animal to the enriched environment.",

    "abstract": "The second order somatosensory thalamic nucleus (posteromedial nucleus, PoM) receives excitatory projection from layer VI of somatosensory cortex. While it is known that layer VI cortical input to first order, ventrobasal nucleus (VB) is modulated by cholinergic projections from the brainstem, no such data exists concerning the PoM nucleus. In order to study if layer VI corticothalamic transmission to PoM is also modulated we used patch-clamp recording in thalamocortical slices from the rat’s brain. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were evoked in PoM cells by trains of 5 electrical pulses at 20 Hz frequency applied to corticothalamic fibers. After carbachol was applied to mimic activation of the cholinergic neuromodulatory system corticothalamic EPSP amplitudes were reduced, while facilitation of EPSP amplitudes was enhanced for each next pulse in the series. Such cholinergic control of layer VI corticothalamic synapses in PoM may be used as gain modulator for the transfer of the peripheral sensory information to the cortex.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we presented sentences either ending with high or low probability cloze words or semantically incongruent words to investigate the influence of L2 proficiency on electrophysiological correlates of semantic processing in bilinguals. Event-related potentials (ERPs) as well as the oscillatory dynamics of the EEG signal, specifically, frequency power changes expressed as event-related (de)synchronization (ERD/S), were analyzed. Replicating earlier results, we found an N400 on semantically incongruent words, as well as on low cloze probability words. For the bilinguals investigated in the present study, N400 latency in the low cloze probability condition was found to be modulated by L2 proficiency, indicating that L2 proficiency in our sample might have influenced the speed of semantic integration. Relative Theta power increased for all three word conditions, but no influence of proficiency was observed. Different from the ERP results, we found a stronger increase in theta power for low cloze probability words than for incongruent and high cloze probability words, especially over temporo-parietal brain areas. The spatial distribution of the theta ERD/S results also differed from the N400 topography. Whereas the N400 showed a typical topography with a maximum over temporo-posterior electrode positions, the theta ERD/S topography was maximal for high and low cloze probability words over left central-posterior electrode positions. These findings show that the ERP and ERD/S results are sensitive to semantic processing. The different pattern of the ERD/S results compared to the ERP results, functionally and with regard to topography, suggests that the ERD/S reflects a different aspect or stage of semantic processing, possibly the successful conceptualization of a sentence.",

The sequential induction pattern response consisted of neuronal and microglial OPN upregulation, followed by a later extended phase of expression in reactive astrocytes. OPN immunoreactivity after OGD matched the mRNA induction patterns. Activated microglia revealed OPN staining in focal deposits, whereas neurons and reactive astrocytes showed perinuclear staining with a punctate cytosolic pattern of OPN, typical of secreted proteins. These data demonstrated that the temporal and cellular patterns of OPN induction in reactive glial cells in this in vitro model closely correlated with that in the in vivo model, suggesting that OPN has a multifunctional role in the pathogenesis of ischemic injury.",

    "abstract": "Several studies in rats have shown activation of cortical regions and concurrent deactivation of the hippocampus during the retrieval of spatial memory, as the consolidation process progresses. To determine whether during this post-learning period of memory reorganization, spatial memories are transformed from a specific to a more generic representation, in Experiment 1 we compare remote spatial memory measured using a single probe trial versus relearning. Results show that spatial memory can be effectively retrieved using a single probe trial during the 18 days following learning; after this time a retraining procedure is necessary. In Experiment 2 and 3 we tested the effect of a reminder treatment on the retrieval of remote memory. Results indicate that when the reminder was applied after experimental day 18, the treatment did not significantly improve the retrieval of spatial memory during a retention test (Exp. 2); however, if the reminder was applied before day 18, a significant improvement during the retention test was observed (Exp. 3). In order to investigate the extent to which memory becomes more difficult to retrieve as time passes due specifically to a retrieval deficit, in experiment 4 no significant differences, but marginal ones, were detected between an overtrained group and a control group when the retention test took place 30 days after the end of learning. Overall, the present results suggest that as the consolidation process progresses, spatial information becomes more difficult to recover, in part because the original detailed trace has gradually been transformed into a more schematic representation.",

    "abstract": "Fig. 1 CPEB function in neurons. Following NMDA receptor activation, the kinase (Aurora or CaMKII [Atkins et al., 2004]) is activated and phosphorylates CPEB. Phosphorylation stabil izes Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Fac tor (CPSF ) on the AAUAAA hexanucleotide, which attracts poly(A) p o l y m e r a s e ( PA P ) t o c a t a l y z e polyadenylation. Maskin dissociates from eIF4E (cap binding protein). eIF4G then binds eIF4E and initiates translation. Long term potentiation (LTP) is a long lasting form of synaptic plasticity, thought to be the molecular correlate of learning and memory storage mechanisms [Kandel, 2001]. The enduring nature of LTP has been shown to involve Cytoplasmic Polyadenylation Element Binding proteins (CPEBs), a class of RNA-binding proteins modulating transcription-independent protein synthesis by regulating the poly(A)-tail elongation (Fig.1) [Richter, 2007]. Adapted from from Klann & Dever, 2004 CPEBs bind a conserved nucleotide sequence UUUUUAU (CPE) in the 3’UTR of the target mRNAs, and repress translation, unless phosphorylated. Such protein-mRNA complexes have beed found in dendritic spines of hippocampal neurons, and are likely targets for neuronal activity-induced translation. The 3’UTR mRNA of many key players in synaptic plasticity contain CPE elements. These includes tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) [Shin et al., 2004] – an extracellular protease implicated in neurodegeneration following seizures in mouse brain [Tsirka et al., 1995]. It has been shown that specifically tPA from microglial origin is the neurodegenerating factor [Siao et al., 2003]. CPEBs are present microglial (MG) cells and may regulate production of microglial tPA. In this study we investigate the expression pattern and function of microglial CPEBs and their potential link to tPA expression and temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Fig. 2 Tertiary structure of CPEBs. All four CPEBs expressed in mouse brain are structuralily similar, consistion of N-terminal regulatory domain (containing phosphorylation sites) and C-terminal RNA binding domain containing zink finger motif.",

Co-administration of AP-7 with bicuculline however, facilitated retrieval of passive avoidance in rats, but was without effect on consolidation in this test. Also neither AP-7 nor bicuculline when were given alone had an effect on influenced consolidation. We found no differences in effects of either AP-7 or bicuculline on object recognition regardless whether administered alone or in combination.",

In Expt. I the cats were given 4 sequential reversal trainings of cross vs. disc discrimination and in Expt. II a response to a gate marked with a cross or a disc was submitted to 4 sequential acute extinctions and restorations. The results show that both visual deprivation and rearing in monotonous laboratory environment moderately affect transformation of associations between visual stimuli and hunger drive and instrumental responses. However, in BD cats transformation learning is less impaired than previously studied visual discrimination learning.",

    "abstract": "Drugs able to inhibit calmodulin activation can prevent some consequences of the rise in intracellular calcium. It has recently been shown that intrathecal injection of calmodulin inhibitors induce analgesia in rats. We study here the effect induced by the calmodulin inhibitor, calmidazolium, on the activity of dorsal horn neurons driven by noxious and non-noxious stimuli. Extracellular recordings of convergent (n = 12), low-threshold mechanoreceptive (n = 5) and proprioceptive (n = 5) units were made in the presence of calmidazolium. Calmidazolium (600 micrograms) reduced the noxious (50 degrees C) heat-evoked responses obtained in convergent neurons. On the contrary, the non-noxious tactile responses obtained in low-threshold mechanoreceptive neurons as well as the joint movement-evoked responses obtained in proprioceptive units remained unmodified. We conclude that calmidazolium can block nociceptive processing in the spinal cord and that this fact can help to explain the analgesic effects that intrathecal W-7 and calmidazolium induce in behavioral tests.",

The presence of APOE-epsilon 4 allele is known to increase the risk of early and late onset sporadic and late onset familial forms of AD. In various Western European countries, USA, Canada, Japan and Australia the allelic frequency ranges between 0.1-0.18 in controls, and between 0.24-0.52 in AD patients. In the present study on Polish population, we analyzed the frequency of APOE-epsilon 4 allele in persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD). APOE genotypes were determined in 30 mild to moderate AD (83%) and mixed dementia (MIX, 17%), as well as in 11 nondemented first-degree relatives of AD (NDR), recruited from AD patient registry in Warsaw. Among the AD and MIX patients the APOE-epsilon 4, epsilon 3, epsilon 2 allele frequency was 0.333, 0.65 and 0.017 respectively.",

The bulk-filling method was used to maximize the likelihood that virtually all afferents to the area would be labeled. Despite the vivid retrograde labeling of many thalamic cells with this procedure, no direct auditory projections to the suprasylvian cortex could be found in the thalamus (i.e. in medial geniculate body or in the dorsolateral part of the posterior nucleus). Furthermore, very few cells were labeled in the primary auditory cortex ofthe nearby ectosylvian gyrus. The source of afferents to the suprasylvian cortex originate mostly from the pulvinar-lateral posterior complex and to a lesser extent from ventral lateral and ventral anterior nuclei of the thalamus.",

On PND 70 the subjects were tested for handedness using a paw preference task assessing both the animals' capability to reach a food pellet in a feeding tube and the individual preference for the use of one of the other forepaw. O3 exposure did not affect the animals' capability to learn the task but caused changes in handedness. Specifically, females exposed to the intermediate O3 concentration showed a reduced preference for the right paw than both their same-sex controls and 0.6 ppm males. On PND 100, mice underwent a hot plate test after IP treatment by either saline or morphine HCl (10 mg/kg). The results were generally in the direction of reduced drug sensitivity after exposure to the highest concentration. The evidence for this effect was more robust in the case of an organised avoidance response (wall-rearing) than in the case of a reflexive response (limb withdrawal); in the case of the former, latency data showed an effect on both males and females while frequency data showed an effect only in females. Overall, the O3 effects are suggestive of subtle CNS changes affecting mouse behavioural responses.",

The animals displayed species-specific flyaway only during the initial trials of a session. Subsequently long-latency crossings develops, reflecting a resistance to enter the opposite compartment. A measure based on a comparison of escape latency distributions in the two halves of the 1st session discriminates between good and poor learners. Subgroups of good and poor learners differed in performance efficiency in all five training sessions. Good learners were able to overcome the resistance to enter the opposite compartment and recall the learned short-latency escape.",

We report here ultrastructural changes in the optic nerves. Vacuoles developed within myelinated axons: within axoplasm or within the myelin sheath and these were accompanied by exuberant reaction of macrophages and hypertrophied astrocytes. Axons underwent Wallerian degeneration and dystrophic neurites were also seen. Most important, we observed proliferation of inner mesaxons. Cross-sectional profiles of innumerable myelinated fibers contained membranous organelles which were continuous with the inner lamellae of the oligodendroglial cells. These unusual proliferations of inner mesaxons formed whorls and elaborated loops. In some axons, proliferation was so severe that loops of mesaxon filled the whole cross-section of the axon. Occasionally, we observed intrusion of the membranous tongue of the inner mesaxon into axoplasm.",

Group C reached postoperative criterion immediately while groups AT and H needed additional training. When subsequently tested at longer delays and with distractions, the group H animals performed more poorly than either the AT or C animals. Further, the group H dogs were again impaired when they retrained at a l0 s delay. In the second phase, the group H and AT animals received a second lesion forming a group (HAT) with bilateral lesions to both the hippocampus and the anterior temporal lobe. Unexpectedly, dogs from group HAT were unimpaired in either postoperative retraining or during performance task and distractions. The results emphasize the importance of the hippocampus in spatial delayed response with an acoustic cue. Effect of combined lesions after extensive training is discussed.

Every day for two weeks the pups from the first group received 15 min of handling whereas the animals from the second group were exposed to various aversive stimuli, differing each day. Following these manipulations, after as-day break the acoustic startle response (ASR) was measured in all animals and the testing was repeated after another four weeks. Statistical analysis of the data revealed significant differences between groups in the ASR parameters. Surprisingly, in the test which directly followed the treatment the mean ASR amplitudes were similar in both groups. Highly significant differences, however, were observed in the ASR amplitude four weeks later. The rats from the handling group responded with greater amplitudes. The latency of the ASR was significantly shorter in the nonaversive group compared with the second group exposed to aversive stimuli. The results suggest that early exposure to aversive stimulation significantly decreases rats emotional reactivity whereas nonaversive and impoverished stimulation clearly elevates arousal levels when the animal is placed in a novel situation.",

The present work examined some parameters of energy metabolism in nerve endings of the brains of adult rats exposed to Pb. We applied the model of acute Pb toxicity in vivo, imitating the acute action of lead observed in occupationally exposed workers or in occasional incidents of poisoning. The measurement of Pb levels in the synaptosomal fraction exhibited its significant accumulation under applied conditions. Oxygen consumption increased in synaptosomes from Pb-treated rats whereas the activity of cytochrome c oxidase did not change. The intrasynaptosomal levels of ATP and CrP were significantly elevated, as was the activity of creatine kinase, suggesting the activation of the CrP/CK system. On the other hand, the activity of the synaptosomal Na+,K(+)-ATP-ase decreased. We suggest that under acute Pb toxicity conditions the mobiliaztion of CrP/CK system may take place to protect the cell against the effects of decreased Na+,K(+)-ATP-ase activity.",

    "abstract": "There are conflicting reports on the influence of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) on the process of learning. We decided to study this problem using the paradigm of classical eyeblink conditioning as the animal model of learning processes. During the extinction training TRH in its natural form of pG1uTRH was applied into the rabbit hippocampus through a chronically implanted microdialysis probe. A Glu(1)TRH, analog with less biological potency than TRH as the control of specificity for TRH and a 0.9% NaCl solution as the control for both substances were applied by the same way as pGluTRH. We found that pGluTRH extended the process of extinction and enhanced the further acquisition of the reflex. The analog of TRH, Glu(1)TRH, was ineffective. Finally, it may be stated that TRH acting in the hippocampus prolonged process of forgetting and improved succeeding learning. The effect was specific and long lasting.",

    "abstract": "Prolonged or repeated seizures have been shown to cause spontaneous recurrent seizures, increased anxiety-related behavior, locomotor hyperactivity, impaired functions of learning and memory, and neuronal damage in the hippocampus and other brain regions in animals.Mice and rats treated with antimuscarinic drugs after fasting for two days or less develop convulsions after being allowed to eat ad libitum.To address whether such behavioral and neuroanatomic changes occur following these convulsions, mice treated i.p. with saline (control) or 2.4 mg/kg atropine and given food after 24 h of fasting were grouped according to seizure scores for behavioral and histological analysis.Following convulsions, the occurrence of spontaneous recurrent seizures was observed for 30 days.Motor activity and grooming behavior were assessed in the open field, and memory was assessed using the novel object recognition test 4 and 7 days after onset of convulsions, respectively.Animals allocated for the histological analysis were decapitated 7 days after onset of convulsions and hippocampal slices were evaluated for the percentage of degenerating neurons stained with Fluoro-Jade C. Spontaneous recurrent seizures, locomotor alterations, anxiety-related behavior, memory impairment, and neuronal loss in the granular layer of the dentate gyrus were not detected in the animals with seizure score 1-2 or 3-5.These results are in accordance with those related to the absence of behavioral changes, cognitive deficits, and hippocampal neuronal damage after single brief seizures in animals and patients with epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsic signal optical imaging (ISOI) has been used previously for the detection of changes in sensory processing in the somatosensory cortex in response to environment alteration or after deprivation of sensory information. To date, there have been no reports of ISOI being used in learning‑induced changes in the somatosensory cortex. In the present study, ISOI was performed twice in the same mouse: before and after conditional fear learning. The conditioning paradigm consisted of pairing sensory stimulation of vibrissae with electric tail shock. In order to map the cortical representation of the vibrissa B1 with ISOI, we deflected the vibrissa with an intensive stimulation (frequency of 10 Hz for 6 s). After conditioning, we found that the cortical representation of vibrissa B1 had expanded by an average of 44%, compared with pre‑learning, by using images obtained with ISOI. Previously, we demonstrated an enlargement of the cortical representation of the vibrissae stimulated by the same behavioral training paradigm but using [14C]2‑deoxyglucose. This current investigation provides the first ISOI‑based evidence of learning‑induced changes in plasticity in the barrel cortex. The results indicate that irrespective of physiological mechanisms used for visualization of the vibrissae representation or subject's testing state (aware or anesthetized animal), the conditioning induced changes in each case in the cortical processing of intensive stimuli. This suggests specific functional reorganization of the neuronal circuits. Moreover, ISOI as a noninvasive method of mapping cortical activation in the same animal before and after behavioral training could serve as a very useful tool for precise manipulation within the cortex and for assessing the resulting effects on experience‑dependent cortical plasticity.",

There are many diseases related to neuromuscular junction dysfunction, including myasthenia gravis, Lambert‑Eaton myasthenic syndrome, congenital myasthenic syndromes, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal muscular atrophy. The pathophysiological mechanisms of these diseases have been investigated using many animal models. Among them, mouse models are the most commonly used and have provided the majority of current data. Moreover, advances in human induced pluripotent stem cell technology has resulted in new opportunities to study neuromuscular junction disorders from both patients and healthy individuals. Currently, patient‑specific induced pluripotent stem cells derived from motor neurons have begun to be studied. These studies will help us achieve a more comprehensive understanding of diseases related to neuromuscular junction disorders. We will describe the research models of neuromuscular junction disorders and provide an overview of recent key findings.",

The results showed that intra‑LPGi injection of 17β‑estradiol declined flexing behavior in both phases of the formalin test. Still, it only diminished the late phase of licking behavior in the OVX rats. NMDA receptor antagonist, AP5, reversed the analgesic effect of 17β‑estradiol on flexing behavior in both phases of the formalin test in the OVX rats. The 17β‑estradiol‑induced anti‑nociceptive effect on the flexing duration was prevented by CNQX (AMPA receptor antagonist) only in the early phase of the formalin test in the OVX rats. AP5 and CNQX reduced the anti‑nociceptive effect of 17β‑estradiol in the late phase, but not the early phase of licking response in the OVX rats. These results suggested: (i) The intra‑LPGi injection of 17β‑estradiol is satisfactory in producing modest analgesia on the formalin‑induced inflammatory pain in the OVX rats; (ii) Co‑treatment of glutamate receptors (NMDA and AMPA) antagonists and 17β‑estradiol in the LPGi nucleus decrease the analgesic effect of 17β‑estradiol in the OVX rats; (iii) There is a possible association between 17β‑estradiol and glutamate receptors of the LPGi nucleus on pain coping behavior in the OVX rats.",

Adult Sprague‑Dawley male rats were used in the experiments. The rats were divided into three groups of control, 0.1 mg/kg BV, and 0.5 mg/kg BV. The rats were injected with BV subcutaneously for 15 consecutive days. The open field test (OFT), the elevated plus maze test (EPM), and the forced swimming test (FST) were performed as behavioral assessments. Animals were sacrificed, and brain regions were removed. Leptin levels were measured in various brain regions by ELISA. In the OFT, the total distance and speed for the 0.1 mg/kg BV group increased compared to controls and the 0.5 mg/kg BV group. In the EPM, the 0.1 mg/kg BV group remained in the open arm for a significantly longer period of time compared to the other groups. In the FST, the 0.5 mg/kg BV group was more mobile than the other groups. Leptin levels in the prefrontal cortex were significantly higher in the 0.1 mg/kg BV group compared to the control and 0.5 mg/kg groups. There were no significant differences between groups in hippocampus and amygdala leptin levels. The results of the study show that BV has a positive effect on behavioral parameters. BV may have a positive effect on anxiety‑ and depression‑like behaviors by increasing leptin levels in the prefrontal cortex.",

That size of TVS is also the size of filter cut-off of infectivity as judged from the ultrafiltration studies and the size of the smallest infectious unit as recently estimated. TVS have been found in all naturally occurring and experimentally induced prion diseases, including variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and human familial TSEs – fatal familial insomnia and Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker disease. In longitudinal studies, the number of neuronal processes containing TVS correlates roughly with the incubation period and with infectivity. Hence, they are readily found in hamsters infected with the 263K strain of scrapie but it is very difficult to find them in human TSEs where titer is lower. The composition of TVS is unknown but they are not composed of PrP. Their consistent presence in all TSEs suggests the unexplained role at least of TSE pathogenesis.",

The effect was abolished by naloxone and ω-Conotoxin GVIA. Inhibition was not abolished by strong depolarisation of the cell membrane. In addition, a macroscopic Ba2+ current recorded in cell-attached configuration was inhibited when DAMGO was applied outside the patch pipette. An adenylyl cyclase inhibitor (SQ 22536) and a protein kinase A inhibitor (H-89) decreased Ca2+ current amplitude. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of µ opioid receptors on Ca2+ currents required the activation of protein kinase A. We conclude that activation of µ opioid receptors in medial prefrontal cortex pyramidal neurons inhibits N type Ca2+ channel currents, and that protein kinase A is involved in this transduction pathway.",

The analysis of the results encompassed 3 similar periods: before the infusion (afternoon hours), the first (evening hours), and the second (night hours) halves of the treatment. The night plasma concentration of melatonin in genistein-infused rams was significantly lower than that noted during the respective period in vehicle-infused rams. Plasma GH concentration increased significantly in both vehicle- and genistein-infused rams during the night hours, as compared with the concentrations noted during the afternoon and evening, however, genistein significantly stimulated the amplitude of GH pulses in these latter. The LH concentration was significantly lower during the second part of genistein treatment, than in vehicle-infused rams. The frequency and amplitude of LH pulses clearly tended to decrease following genistein infusion. In conclusion, genistein, acting at the central nervous system level in sexually active rams is able to reduce the secretion of melatonin and LH and has also a slight stimulatory effect on the amplitude of GH pulses.",

Intracellular Ca2+ dynamics was studied using the fluorescent probes fura-2 and chlortetracycline to monitor free and bound calcium (Cai and Cab), respectively. In control cortical slices, application of L-glutamate, NMDA and AMPA induced concomitant increases in Cai and Cab, reflecting Ca2+ influx and its intracellular accumulation in neurons. DHPG, an agonist of group I mGlu receptors induced a decrease in Cab accompanied by a rise in Cai levels, indicating Ca2+ mobilization. In cortical slices collected 24 h after severe hypoxia, the responses of Cab to glutamate administration were increased, DHPG-induced shifts were reversed, the increase in Cab after the first application of AMPA was reduced, while after the second, Cab rises were potentiated, and the increases in Cab evoked by NMDA application were slightly suppressed. The alterations of responses in Cab to the selective agonists were completely prevented by preconditioning with mild hypoxia. Our results suggest that protection of normal glutamatergic calcium signaling contributes to tolerance to hypoxia induced by preconditioning.",

In the light of recent studies AICD seems to be another product of APP proteolysis endowed with important biological functions that may contribute to Alzheimer’s disease pathology.",

    "abstract": "The article summarizes the most meaningful studies which have provided evidence that protein synthesis in neurons can occur not only in cell perikarya but also locally in dendrites. The presence of the complete machinery required to synthesize cytoplasmic and integral membrane proteins in dendrites, identification of binding proteins known to mediate mRNA trafficking in dendrites and the ability to trigger “on-site” translation make it possible for the synthesis of particular proteins to be regulated by synaptic signals. Until now over 100 different mRNAs coding the proteins involved in neurotransmission and modulation of synaptic activity have been identified in dendrites. Local protein synthesis is postulated to provide the basic mechanism of fast changes in the strength of neuronal connections and to be an important factor in the molecular background of synaptic plasticity, giving rise to enduring changes in synaptic function, which in turn play a role in local homeostatic responses. Local protein synthesis points to some autonomy of dendrites which makes them “the brains of the neurons” (Jim Eberwine; from the interview with J. Eberwine – Barinaga 2000).",

Interestingly the highly heterogeneous morphology of dendritic spines is thought to be the morphological basis for synaptic plasticity associated to learning and memory formation. Indeed dendritic spines structure is regulated by molecular mechanisms that are fine tuned and adjusted according to level and direction of synaptic activity, development, specific brain region, and different experimental behavioral conditions. This supports the idea that reciprocal changes between the structure and function of spines impact both local and global integration of signals within dendrites. An increasing number of proteins have been found to be morphogens for dendritic spines and provided new insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating spine formation and morphology. Thus determining the mechanisms that regulate spine formation and morphology is essential for understanding the cellular changes that underlie learning and memory in normal and pathological conditions.",

    "abstract": "Injury to the mature central nervous system (CNS) induces a series of transient changes leading not only to death of neurons, but also to spontaneous rearrangement of the affected network. One of such pro plastic events, detected following injury, is an increased level of neurotrophins. Neurotrophins are a family of proteins involved in survival and outgrowth processes. The other one, more difficult to observe, is a change in the complexity of the dendritic tree, causing arborization or pruning, depending on many circumstances: i.e. lesion etiology. Subsequent therapies like enriched environment or locomotor exercise bring about a functional improvement, which was found to further increase the neurotrophin level and induced additional arborization of dendrites. Another important consequence of damage to CNS connections is deafferentation, shown to induce a down regulation of outgrowth inhibitors. Their suppression in turn may facilitate dendritic plasticity. Taken together, these factors may contribute to enhanced plasticity in the injured mature CNS. Thus the proper use of endogenously increased plastic potential seems to be important for design and optimizing therapeutic strategies. Further investigation of mechanisms involved in switching on plasticity may help to improve on existing therapies and find new ways to obtain better recovery following injury.",

    "abstract": "The face is one of the most important stimuli carrying social meaning. Thanks to the fast analysis of faces, we are able to judge physical attractiveness and features of their owners’ personality, intentions, and mood. From one’s facial expression we can gain information about danger present in the environment. It is obvious that the ability to process efficiently one’s face is crucial for survival. Therefore, it seems natural that in the human brain there exist structures specialized for face processing. In this article, we present recent findings from studies on the neuronal mechanisms of face perception and recognition in the light of current theoretical models. Results from brain imaging (fMRI, PET) and electrophysiology (ERP, MEG) show that in face perception particular regions (i.e. FFA, STS, IOA, AMTG, prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex) are involved. These results are confirmed by behavioral data and clinical observations as well as by animal studies. The developmental findings reviewed in this article lead us to suppose that the ability to analyze face-like stimuli is hard-wired and improves during development. Still, experience with faces is not sufficient for an individual to become an expert in face perception. This thesis is supported by the investigation of individuals with developmental disabilities, especially with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD).",

The structural changes described above, involving the oscillations in the number of synapses and the size of interneurons and glial cells, are examples of plasticity in the central nervous system driven by internal inputs from a circadian clock and by external stimuli such as light.

The time course of synaptic currents is largely determined by the kinetics of the postsynaptic receptors and the time course of synaptic neurotransmitter concentration. The analysis of current responses to rapid agonist applications provides the means to study the ligand-gated receptor gating but experimentally based estimation of neurotransmitter transient at central synapses was an important challenge during the last decade. Both theoretical as well as experimentally based approaches indicated that synaptic agonist transient is very brief, implying that the activation of postsynaptic receptors occurs in conditions of extreme non-equilibrium. Such a dynamic pattern of activation of postsynaptic receptors has a crucial impact not only on the kinetics of synaptic currents but also on their susceptibility to pharmacological modulation.",

The globus pallidus of the opossum consists of medial and lateral parts that are visible with Nissl or Timm’s staining and also in PV and CR immunostained sections. Neurons of the globus pallidus expressing these proteins were classified into three types on the basis of size and shape of their soma and dendritic tree. Type 1 neurons had medium-sized fusiform soma with dendrites sprouting from the opposite poles. Neurons of the type 2 had medium-to-large, multipolar soma with scarce, thin dendrites. Cell bodies of type 3 neurons were small and either ovoid or round. Immunostaining showed that the most numerous were neurons expressing PV that belonged to all three types. Density of the PV-immunopositive fibers and puncta correlated with the density of the PV-labeled neurons. Labeling for CB resulted mainly in the light staining of neuropil in both parts of the nucleus, while the CB-expressing cells (mainly of the type 2) were scarce and placed only along the border of the globus pallidus and putamen. Staining for calretinin resulted in labeling almost exclusively the immunoreactive puncta and fibers that were distributed with medium-to-high density throughout the nucleus. Close to the border of globus pallidus with the putamen these fibers (probably dendrites) were long, thin and varicous, while more medially bundles of thick, short and smooth fibers predominated. Single CR-ir neurons (all of the type 3) were scattered through the globus pallidus. Colocalization of two calcium binding proteins in one neuron was never observed. The CB-ir puncta (probably terminals of axons projecting to the nucleus) frequently formed basket-like structures around the PV-ir neurons. Therefore, the globus pallidus in the opossum, much as that in the rat, consists of a heterogeneous population of neurons, probably playing diversified functions.",

The response to treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors is clinically difficult to predict. Several demographic, clinical and biological variables have been proposed as pretreatment predictors of long-term therapy efficacy. In this paper, consistently with previous reports, we confirm that higher initial disease severity and faster progression of cognitive impairment increase the chance of a clinically meaningful response to cholinesterase inhibitor therapy in a carefully selected population of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, for the first time we demonstrate the association between the increase in the concentration of plasma Ab1-42 peptide after 2 weeks of treatment with an initial dose of rivastigmine and the likelihood of a positive response to treatment after 6 months. A change in plasma Ab1-42 level might constitute a novel biochemical predictor of rivastigmine treatment efficacy in Alzheimer's disease. Correspondence should be addressed to T.

General mouse knock‑outs, homozygous for the inactivated Tsc1 alleles do not survive and die at early embryonal stages. To circumvent this problem, we utilized the Cre/loxP system and removed Tsc1 specifically in Purkinje cells using the pcp2/L7Cre mouse strain and the Tsc1tmDjk/J strains. Because of the published results showing the autistic‑like symptoms after the same crossbred, we have decided to look closer at the early postnatal period of these mutants.

    "abstract": "Speech understanding, watching a movie, listening to music etc., requires perception of the temporal order of at least two incoming events. A history of performing these tasks may be reflected in spontaneous brain activity. Here, we examined the relationship between the complexity (temporal dynamics) of resting‑state EEG (rsEEG) signal, assessed using the multivariate MultiScale Entropy (mMSE) algorithm, and the perception of event ordering, indexed by a visual temporal order threshold (TOT), i.e., the minimum duration necessary to correctly identify the before‑after relation between two stimuli. Healthy adolescents and young adults performed a psychophysical task measuring the TOT and underwent an eyes‑closed rsEEG study. The features of mMSE vectors, namely the area under curve (AUC) that represents total signal complexity, as well as the MaxSlope and the AvgEnt, corresponding to the entropy at fine‑ and coarse‑grained timescales, respectively, were obtained for the central (midline), anterior, middle and posterior channel sets. The greater the AUC and AvgEnt values in the central, left and right posterior areas, and the higher AUC in the right middle region, the higher the TOT. The most significant relationships were found for the midline electrodes (Fz, Cz, Pz, Oz). There were no significant correlations between the MaxSlope values and the TOT. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that spontaneous EEG signal complexity is associated with the temporal order perception of two stimuli presented in rapid succession. Our findings may indicate that low total and coarse entropy levels of rsEEG signal are beneficial for visual temporal order judgments.",

It is a highly dynamic process in which dendritic branches form and regress until mature connectivity is achieved. Thereafter, dendritic branches are considered stable and do not undergo substantial rearrangements, although several exceptions have been described in the literature. After this long period of relative stability, significant changes in dendritic branching occur when the brain begins to age. Several neurological diseases, occurring both during development and in adulthood, have severe effects on the morphology of dendritic arbors, often associated with intellectual dysfunction. The molecular mechanisms of dendritogenesis are fairly well described. In contrast, knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of dendritic arbor stabilization and pathology‑induced instability is still quite incomplete, and several important questions remain unanswered. We describe the dynamic changes during development and adulthood and in different pathologies. Whenever possible, we also provide details on the molecular mechanisms behind dendritic dynamics and stability.",

Experiments were performed on isolated giant axon of a cockroach using double oil gap technique. K+ accumulation was reduced by: (1) an outward water flow induced by non-electrolytes (urea, glucose) added to extracellular saline and (2) by an increase of non-specific permeability of axonal glial layer obtained after the application of DMSO. The conclusions are: (1) osmolar effect depends on the type of molecule used for osmotic shock, (2) increase of outward K+ current in conditions of high extraaxonal osmotic pressure is attributed to the decrease of K+ accumulation and outward water flow, (3) removal of K+ accumulation doesn't affect the kinetics and the time course of K+ current, (4) experiments confirmed the presence of an inactivating component in the axonal outward K+ current, (5) DMSO must be used cautiously as a solvent in electrophysiological experiments.",

    "abstract": "Forelimb trajectory and the activity of eight muscles operating at the elbow, wrist and digit joints were analyzed during contact placing (CP) reactions elicited by tactile stimuli applied to the lateral (L) or medial (M) side of the cat's forepaw to verify whether a common movement strategy was used in these reactions. A tactile stimulus applied to the lateral side of the paw led, most frequently, to a short-latency activation of the elbow flexor muscles and flexor carpi radialis. Stimulation of the medial side of the paw produced either a short-latency activation of the elbow flexors or both the elbow flexor and extensor muscles. At the distal joints it most frequently activated extensor carpi ulnaris and flexor carpi radialis muscles. Different patterns of activation of the muscles during LCP and MCP reactions led to a diverse involvement of elbow flexion and extension movements at the beginning of the reactions. LCP was usually initiated by the elbow flexion movement whereas during MCP reactions the elbow flexion often appeared with a delay due to a brief co-contraction of the elbow flexor and extensor muscles which temporarily locked the elbow joint. The latter reaction was initiated by a backward/upward movement at the proximal joints accompanied by an ulnar deviation and a palmar flexion of the paw. The medio-lateral components of the movement were also clearly different in LCP and MCP reactions, both at the proximal and distal joints. The results indicate that various strategies of movement are used in CP reactions depending on the site of tactile stimulation.",

The effect of a neonatal vibrissal follicles removal was studied in adult mice: barrels corresponding to intact follicles were enlarged whereas those representing removed follicles had not developed. MAP-2 immunopositive profiles were considered to be dendritic clusters and their packing density (a number per unit area) was calculated in an enlarged barrel and compared to a control barrel in a contralateral hemisphere. A decrease in the packing density of large dendritic clusters (area over 10 microns 2), presumably arising from layer V, was observed in an enlarged barrel in comparison to its control counterpart. This result may indicate a rearrangement of a dendritic pattern in mouse barrel field after a selective neonatal lesion of vibrissal follicles.",

In order to precisely describe those differences in humans we performed a morphological and morphometric study on the dorsal vagal nucleus of the medulla oblongata, on Ammon's horn and on neocortex from midgestation to the 18th postnatal month. The numerical density of neurones, cell perikarya and nuclear cross-sectional area, and the ratio of nucleus to perikaryon area were measured. The results demonstrate a development-dependent decrease in cell density and progressive differentiation of neurones according to their changing size. They express a process of maturation which differs in rate across the CNS structures examined.",

Three groups received ten daily i.p. injections of PC at doses of 750,000, 500,000 and 250,000 IU/kg b.w. For comparison, another classic convulsant, pentylenetrazol (PTZ) was applied in the same way to another group. PTZ was also given to all rats before and after injection series for better evaluation of changes in CNS excitability. Repeated PC injections resulted in a progressive increase in the basal level of the spontaneous SWD activity and in an increase in the SWD response to PC, which was statistically significant in the case of the dose 750,000 IU/kg. Moreover, in all rats given PC the response to PTZ (increase in SWD activity) was reduced. The results obtained in this and previous experiment suggest that in the course of repeated systemic Pc administration adaptive changes in the rat CNS develop which prevent the convulsive effects of Pc but promote the occurrence of the spontaneous nonconvulsive SWD activity.",

About 20% of the X type neurones showed clear nonlinearities of summation when stimulated by two simultaneously onset, small bars of light. The possible source of this nonlinearity was studied on a specially designed model of a one-layer neuronal network with inhibitory, recurrent interactions, intended to mimic the inhibitory influence exerted on geniculate relay cells by perigeniculate interneurones. The model, when activated from periphery by two stimuli-like input patterns, produced at the output side the nonsymmetrical profiles of the receptive fields sensitivity, similar to those obtained in real experiments. This nonlinear output appeared when some of the relay cells were inhibited below their firing level threshold and this effect was spread through the network by lateral inhibitory connections. It is concluded that physiologically observed nonlinearities of the order of single receptive field mechanisms can be predicted by a simple recurrent network.",

    "abstract": "Various structural alterations of gonadotropins and their receptors (R) contribute to the polymorphism of gonadotropin action. One reason is the microheterogeneity of gonadotropins due to variations in the degree of their glycosylation. This alters the intrinsic bioactivity of gonadotropins, as reflected by changes in their bioactivity to immunoreactivity ratios in various physiological and clinical conditions. We have reassesses this phenomenon by improved in vitro bioassay and immunoassay methods, and it appears that the intrinsic bioactivity of gonadotropins, in particular of LH, is more constant than previously demonstrated. The second part of this chapter deals with a common polymorphism that was recently discovered in the gene of the LH beta-subunit. The variant LHbeta allele contains two point mutations, both altering the amino acid sequence (Trp8Arg and Ile15Thr), the latter one in addition introduces a new glycosylation signal to the LHbeta peptide. The variant seems to represent an evolutionary early form of LH, being structurally closer to hCG than wild-type LH. The LH variant is common world-wide, with the carrier frequency varying from 28% in Finland to 7.5% in North American Hispanics. The LH variant differs functionally from wild-type LH, and it seems to predispose the carriers to mild aberrations of reproductive function. The third section summarizes our findings on the first mutation of the FSHR gene. This inactivating missense mutation is located in the gene sequence encoding the extracellular domain of the FSHR (Ala189Val). The mutated receptor protein is apparently incorrectly folded and devoid of biological activity. The mutation explains about 50% of the hereditary form of hypergonadotropic ovarian dysgenesis in the Finnish population.",

Results reveal that ipsilateral cortical connections of area 18 with three regions of cortex are topological. In areas 17 and 19, separate patches of cells labeled with different tracers progressed in a rostrocaudal sequence corresponding to the order of the injections. A similar but less precise pattern of rostrocaudal labeling occurred in more lateral visual cortex, even though several presumptive visual areas were involved. Thus, anteromedial suprasylvian cortex projected to anterior area 18 while more posterolateral suprasylvian cortex projected to posterior area 18. There was no evidence of double-labeled cells projecting to separate regions in area 18. These results are more consistent with the concept of a single suprasylvian area projecting to area 18 cortex than several.",

Carnitine is accumulated by neural cells in a sodium-dependent way. The existence of a novel transporter in plasma membrane, specific to compounds with a polar group in the B-position with respect to carboxyl group, has been postulated. The presence of a carnitine carrier in the inner mitochondrial membrane has been proven and the protein has been purified. It is postulated that its major role in adult brain would be translocation of acetyl moieties from mitochondria into the cytoplasm for acetylcholine synthesis. The latter process is stimulated by carnitine and choline in a synergistic way in cells utilizing glucose as the main energetic substrate. Carnitine metabolism in neural cells leads to accumulation of different acyl derivatives of carnitine. Palmitoylcarnitine can influence directly the activity of protein kinase C. An involvement of carnitine in a decrease of palmitate pool used for palmitoylation of regulatory proteins has been postulated.",

Because of its potent neurite growth repressive activity, MAG is also likely to play an important role in axonal guidance during the CNS development, and to be responsible for abortive neuronal regeneration in adult CNS. The MAG gene chromatin from approximately -1.6 to +0.6 kb features MNase hypersensitivity that may delineate the gene control region. The proximal upstream region of the gene is organized into an array of five nucleosomes with hypersensitive linkers. The core promoter is located within the first upstream linker that becomes highly hypersensitive in the course of oligodendrocyte differentiation. The adjacent upstream region contains positive and negative enhancers that are likely to streamline oligodendrocyte specific expression of the gene. The TATA-less core promoter contains novel, as yet uncharacterized initiator elements that direct the assembly of transcriptional complexes. The promoter appears to be controlled by both, the addition of activating trans-factors and the removal of inhibitory trans-factors as progenitor cells differentiate into mature oligodendrocyte. The developmental activation of the gene is also concomitant with profound DNA demethylation that may provide auxiliary regulatory mechanisms. Hence, the upregulation of the MAG gene in differentiating oligodendrocytes entails chromatin remodeling as well as changes in the assortment of nuclear trans-factors.",

Northern blot analysis was performed using specific cDNA for inducible NOS. It was observed that ischemia significantly enhances NOS activity and cGMP level. During reperfusion, biphasic increase in NOS activity and cGMP level took place with two peaks 15 min and 2 h after ischemia. NNLA, 7-NI, and LY 83583 eliminated enhancements of NOS activity and cGMP level, whereas glucocorticoid remained without effect. There was no activation of gene encoding inducible NOS (iNOS).

Still many questions concerning the generation of Ca2+ signal such as the nature of the main routes of ischemic Ca2+ influx to neurones, involvement of intracellular Ca2+ stores and Ca2+ buffers, spatial and temporal relations between ischemia-induced increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration and neurotoxicity remain open.

The mechanism of chemotransduction is until now not well understood. In this study the regulation of arachidonic acid (AA) release and its incorporation into membrane glycerolipids were investigated. Moreover, the effect of hypoxia and dopamine (DA) on these processes was evaluated. The CB were excised from cats exposed in situ to normoxia or hypoxia. Then CB were homogenized and used as a source of enzyme (s). It was observed that Ca2+ enhanced the release of AA by 40–50% through the action of phospholipase C together with diacyl-glycerollipase and phospholipase A2. Acute hypoxia significantly decreased AA incorporation into phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) and enhanced the level of AA radioactivity in diacylglycerol and AA-CoA. These results suggest that hypoxia induces inhibition of AA incorporation on the level of acyl-CoA-lysophospholipid:acylotransferases. DA decreased AA incorporation into PtdIns and exerted an additive inhibitory effect in hypoxic samples. These results demonstrate that AA metabolism in CB is significantly affected by hypoxia and that DA is not responsible for the hypoxia-induced alteration of lipid metabolism in CB.",

On one of these cases the lesion was cortico-subcortical in a part of the frontal lobe, temporal lobe and a part of the occipital lobe, with sparing of the deep structures of the right hemisphere and with clinical pattern resembling that of Broca aphasia. In the second case the lesion involved the subcortical and deep structures with destruction of the lentiform nucleus, anterior part of the internal capsule and part of the head of the caudate nucleus, and the clinical pattern resembled that of Wernicke aphasia.",

Paralytic tremor (pt) is a spontaneous mutation in rabbit that affects irregular and defective myelination of CNS. Antioxidant enzyme levels were different in three brain regions: brain hemispheres, cerebellum, and brain stem. In brain hemisphere and cerebellum of pt rabbits Mn-SOD and Cu, Zn-SOD activities were elevated. Catalase activity in brain hemispheres and peroxidase activity in the brain stem of pt rabbits were reduced. It was also noticed, that in the pt rabbit the ratio CAT/Cu, Zn-SOD was lower by 20% in the brain hemispheres and by 13% in the cerebellum and the ratio POX/Cu, Zn-SOD was lower by 31.8% in the brain stem. These findings indicated that pt mutations are associated with changes in the antioxidant defense system in the rabbit brain.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to find out whether the occurrence of bursts of spontaneous spike-wave discharges (SWD) in rat neocortex is related to a particular state of vigilance (level of arousal), as some authors suggested, or rather to transitions from one state to another as postulated by others. Patterns of cortical and hippocampal EEG preceding and following the SWD bursts were studied in rats. It has been found that the beginning of an SWD episode is usually preceded by a shift of cortical activity toward synchronization and replacement of the rhythmic slow activity (RSA) in the hippocampus by large irregular activity (LIA). After SWD, the cortical activity is usually more desynchronized and RSA is present more frequently than just before its onset. An analysis of selected episode-free and episode-rich EEG segments revealed that SWD's occur in abundance at the periods characterized by frequent changes of the hippocampal EEG pattern but are absent during the periods in which long-lasting RSA trains dominate in the record. Thus, the data confirm that SWD occurrence is related more to transitions from one state to another than to a particular state as such. They also indicate that the preferable conditions for SWD's appear when arousal is decreasing from a moderate to a lower level.",

    "abstract": "In our previous event-related potential (ERP) study [A. Nowicka, I. Szatkowska, Memory-induced modulation of event-related potentials in frontal cortex of human subjects: a divided visual field study, Neurosci. Lett. 359 (2004) 171-174], word repetition effects in right-handed males were observed only in case of the direct stimulation of the left (competent) hemisphere. Since the left-handedness and the factor of female gender may determine the lateralization of verbal functions, the goal of the present study was to test the sensitivity of the ERP repetition effects to the visual field of word presentation in the group of left- and right-handed women. ERPs were recorded from symmetrical sites over the left and right hemisphere. Target words were presented in the left (LVF) or right (RVF) visual hemifield. Subjects' were instructed to recognize the target word on a response card. A substantial portion of words was repeated twice. Words elicited different ERPs at frontal sites when presented the first and second times: ERPs were more positive to the repeated stimulus than to its first occurrence. However, in right-handed participants, repetition effects were only observed when target words were presented to the RVF whereas in left-handed participants, repetition effects were only observed when target words were presented to the LVF. These findings are indicative of the asymmetrical involvement of the two hemispheres in memory-induced modulation of brain activity related to verbal processing in left- and right-handed women.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have suggested that exercise in a running wheel can be neuroprotective, perhaps due to, among others, gene-expression changes after exercise, increases in trophic proteins and/or enhanced cardiovascular responsivity. Here we ask whether physical exercise or environmental enrichment provide protection after brain damage, especially in terms of recovery of cognitive function. To evaluate the neuroprotective effect of these conditions, we used the kainic acid (KA) model of neuronal injury. Systemically-administered KA induces excitotoxicity by overstimulation of glutamate receptors, resulting in neuronal death by necrosis and apoptosis. Our results show that exercise, but not enriched environment, prior to KA-induced brain damage, improved behavioural performance in both Morris watermaze and object exploration tasks. However, prior exercise did not decrease to control levels the hyperactivity normally seen in KA-treated animals, as measured by ambulation in the open field. Furthermore, both exercise and enriched environment did not protect against neuron loss in CA1, CA2 and CA3 areas of the hippocampus, despite a substantial increase in brain-derived neutrophic factor (BDNF) levels in dentate gyrus of the exercise and KA-treated animals.",

    "abstract": "Abstract: A major area of investigations in\r\n neuroscience is directed at understanding factors that\r\n participate in neural survival versus death. A number\r\n of neurotrophic growth factors have been identified\r\n that promote neuronal survival and differentiation. The\r\n transforming growth factors-beta (TGF-s) constitute a\r\n family of multifunctional cytokines. Their functions\r\n include control of cell proliferation, differentiation\r\n and regulation of cell survival and death. Glial\r\n cellAs mutant mice lacking TGF-s2 or GDNF die during\r\n birth, double mutant mice have to be generated by first\r\n breeding heterozygous mice to generate double\r\n heterozygous mice and finally double mutant mice. The\r\n expected ratio was 1:16 embryos. A total of 270 embryos\r\n was btained of which 11 instead of the expected 17 were\r\n double mutant mice. The embryos were obtained from\r\n embryonic days 12 to 18. To test the hypothesis of\r\n whether TGF-s2/GDNF synergistically promote neuron\r\n survival, a wide spectrum of neuron populations was\r\n analysed at E18, the latest stage accessible before\r\n birth and consequently death of the mutant mice. At\r\n E18.5 there was a significantly decreased number of\r\n neurons detectable in the motoneuron population, the\r\n sympathetic ganglionic neurons as well as some\r\n parasympathetic neuron populations. The loss of\r\n parasympathetic neurons was comparable to the phenotype\r\n of GDNF mutant mice, whereas lumbar motoneurons and\r\n neurons of the SCG resulted in a clear unique phenotype\r\n due to the double null condition. These data suggest\r\n that TGF-s and GDNF synergise to promote neuron\r\n survival during development of lumbar motoneurons as\r\n well as SCG neurons.Both TGF-s as well as GDNF are well known for their\r\n survival-promoting effect of midbrain dopaminergic\r\n neurons. Therefore, special attention was given to the\r\n analysis of their development. At embryonic stage 12.5\r\n (E12.5), the total number of midbrain dopaminergic\r\n neurons was significantly decreased in mice deficient\r\n for TGF-s2 (Tgfs2-/-) compared to wild-type (Tgfs2+/+)\r\n mouse embryos. This may give an indication that TGF-s2\r\n plays a role in the early induction of the dopaminergic\r\n neurons. Surprisingly, at E14.5 and E18.5, our analysis\r\n failed to reveal significant differences in the total\r\n number of TH-positive cells in the substantia nigra\r\n pars compacta (SNpc) and the vental tegmental area\r\n (VTA) in Tgfs2-/-Gdnf +/-, Tgfs2+/-Gdnf -/-,\r\n Tgfs2-/-Gdnf -/- mutant mouse embryos compared to the\r\n controls (Tgfs2+/+Gdnf +/+). This may indicate that\r\n these genes seem to have a marginal effect on the\r\n development of the midbrain dopaminergic neurons at\r\n these stages in vivo, but may be more important in\r\n postnatal maturation of the system. Moreover, the one\r\n year old Tgfs2+/- and double heterozygous (Tgfs2+/-Gdnf\r\n +/-) mice showed a marginal decrease (10% and 13%,\r\n respectively) in the dopaminergic neurons compared to\r\n the controls (Tgfs2+/+Gdnf +/+).The locus coeruleus (LC) is the noradrenergic\r\n nucleus that is severely affected in neurodegenerative\r\n disorders. In this study, at E14.5 there were no\r\n significant differences observed in the total number of\r\n neurons within the LC between Tgfs2-/-, Gdnf -/-,\r\n Tgfs2-/-Gdnf +/-, Tgfs2+/-Gdnf -/- mouse embryos and\r\n the controls (Tgfs2+/+Gdnf +/+).The total number of serotonergic neurons at E12.5\r\n was significantly decreased in mice deficient for\r\n TGF-s2 (Tgfs2-/-) compared with wild-type mouse embryos\r\n (Tgfs2+/+). This may indicate that TGF-s2 plays a role\r\n in the early induction of the serotonergic neurons.\r\n Moreover, there was a significant decrease in the total\r\n number of serotonergic neurons in Tgfs2-/- and\r\n Tgfs2-/-Gdnf +/- in the paramedian raphe (PMR) at E18.5\r\n compared with wild-type mouse embryos. On the other\r\n hand, quantification of rostral 5-HT-positive cells\r\n showed a decrease at E14.5 in the double mutant mice\r\n (Tgfs2-/-Gdnf -/-) compared with wild-type mouse\r\n embryos, but differences did not reach statistical\r\n significance. One out of three double knockout mice at\r\n E14.5 and E18.5 showed a severe defect (reduction) in\r\n the number of the rostral 5-HT-positive neurons which\r\n may be due to genetic penetrance.Chromaffin cells are thought to develop from the\r\n same progenitors as sympathetic neurons. In the present\r\n study, effects of TGF-s2 and GDNF on proliferation and\r\n differentiation of chromaffin cells in mouse adrenal\r\n chromaffin cells were investigated in a genetic mouse\r\n model. We observed a significant increase in the total\r\n number of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells (TH+) in\r\n Tgfs2-/- and Tgfs2-/-Gdnf -/- double knockout mouse\r\n embryos at E14.5 and E18.5 compared to wild-type\r\n animals (Tgfs2+/+ ), but no changes in the number of\r\n TH-immunoreactive cells were observed in GDNF mouse\r\n mutants. At E15.5 but not at E18.5, there was a marked\r\n increase in the number of proliferative cell nuclear\r\n antigen (PCNA+) positive chromaffin cells in Tgfs2-/-\r\n knockout embryos compared to the wild type group. On\r\n the other hand, there was a clear decrease in the ratio\r\n of total number of\r\n phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase-positive cells\r\n (PNMT+) to the total TH+ in Tgfs2-/- mouse embryos at\r\n E18.5 compared to wild type animals. This is the first\r\n documentation of the physiological significance of\r\n TGF-s2, an isoform that has been suggested to play a\r\n role in the regulation of chromaffin cell proliferation\r\n and differentiation based on in vitro experiments.Tgfs2+/+Gdnf -/- and Tgfs2-/-Gdnf -/- double mutant\r\n mouse embryos lack most of the enteric neurons using\r\n neurofilament (NF) antibody as a neuronal marker. This\r\n result is consistent with the results from GDNF\r\n knockout mice, Gdnf -/- mice showed an absence of the\r\n enteric nervous system (ENS) neurons.In addition to the hypothesis-based analysis and\r\n results there were some obvious additional phenotypes\r\n detectable in TGF-s2/GDNF double mutant mice. At E14.5\r\n and E18.5 the entire neural retina of Tgfs2-/-Gdnf -/-\r\n double mutant mouse embryos and Tgfs2-/-Gdnf+/-\r\n littermates was significantly thicker than wild-type\r\n retina. Interestingly, the double mutant mice\r\n (Tgfs2-/-Gdnf -/-) showed a complete detachment of the\r\n retina from the underlying pigment epithelium at E18.5\r\n and the retina was folded (coloboma formation) at\r\n E18.5. Furthermore, Tgfs2-/-Gdnf -/- double mutant mice\r\n showed some phenotypes outside the central and\r\n peripheral nervous system. Tgfs2-/-Gdnf -/- double\r\n mutant embryos showed a reduction in the thickness of\r\n the ventral body wall and muscle development, defects\r\n in extracellular matrix formation (ECM), and\r\n acceleration in molar tooth development.In summary, TGF-s2/GDNF mutant mice show a unique\r\n pattern of phenotypes that partly may be due to a\r\n synergism in regulating neuronal survival e.g. MN and\r\n SCG. Furthermore, they may also cooperate in other\r\n places by regulating proliferation, differentiation as\r\n well as production and composition of extracellular\r\n matrix. The data obtained also suggest a wide array of\r\n potential clinical implications, ranging from the\r\n understanding to the treatment of motoneuron to eye\r\n disease.",

This has been shown anatomically for selective auditory cognitive functions (Adriani et al. 2003b). We investigate here behavioral correlates that may accompany the use of alternative processing networks and in particular the resulting increase in response times. The performance of 5 patients with right or left unilateral hemispheric infarction and 6 normal control subjects in sound identification, asemantic sound recognition, sound localization, and sound motion perception was evaluated by the number of correct replies and response times for correct and wrong replies. Performance and response times were compared across patients and normal control subjects. Two patients with left lesions were deficient in sound identification and sound motion perception and normal in sound localization and asemantic sound recognition; one patient with right lesion was deficient in sound localization and sound motion perception and normal in sound identification and asemantic sound recognition; deficient performance was associated with increased response times. The remaining 2 patients (1 with left, 1 with right lesion) had normal performance in all 4 tasks but had significantly longer response times in some (but not all) tasks. Patients with normal or deficient performance tended more often than normal subjects to give faster correct than wrong replies. We propose that increased response time is an indication of processing within an alternative network.",

We address this issue using a number of techniques. We combine neurophysiological recording techniques with neuroanatomical tracing techniques and histochemical methods in an effort to accurately determine the functional subdivisions of the neocortex in a variety of mammals. By using these techniques we can determine common features of neocortical organization, or common cortical areas, which are considered homologous. We can observe modifications to patterns of cortical organization, or to cortical fields specifically, that are independently evolved and generally related to morphological and behavioural specializations. Comparative studies have led us to consider the development of the neocortex and the specific changes in developmental mechanisms that might account for the observed changes in extant adults. Both comparative studies and developmental studies allow us to formulate hypotheses regarding how the neocortex is constructed in the life of an individual, and in a lineage over time.",

    "abstract": "We investigated neuronal activation of the rat intermediolateral (IML) nucleus of the thoracolumbar spinal cord, initiated by Achilles tendon vibration, after intramuscular (m. triceps surae) administration of 7‑nitroindazole (7‑NI) or L‑arginine (LA). The spindle afferent response to vibratory stimuli induced a distinct bilateral increase in the activation of c‑Fos immunoreactivity in the spinal neurons in three groups of rats (tendon‑vibrated, tendon‑vibrated + 7‑NI and tendon‑vibrated + LA). The T5/T13 segments in tendon‑vibrated +7‑NI animals showed the highest increase of Fos‑immunoreactive neurons. This increase was two times higher than that in tendon only‑vibrated control rats and endon‑vibrated + LA animals. The highest mean number of labelled neurons were observed in the IML nucleus and in layers 4 and 7 of the T5-L3 segments in tendon‑vibrated and tendon‑vibrated + 7‑NI animals, and in the IML nucleus and layer 4 in tendon‑vibrated + LA rats. The highest mean number of activated neurons was found ipsilaterally in the IML nucleus of the T5/T13 segment. These results indicate that decreased nitric oxide release after injection of 7‑NI was accompanied by a potentiation of the early c‑fos gene expression induced by muscle proprioceptive activity within the thoracolumbar region of the rat spinal cord. Thus, enhanced c‑Fos immunoreactivity in the IML nucleus indicated that the sympathetic nervous system can exert a direct influence on the muscle spindles.",

    "abstract": "Streptozotocin (STZ) is a bacterial toxin which selectively damages both insulin-producing cells and insulin receptors. Injections of STZ into the cerebral ventricles of experimental animals are followed by sustained biochemical, metabolic and behavioral effects resembling those which are found in human brains afflicted by Alzheimer's disease. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of double intracerebroventricular application of STZ on the ultrastructure of rat frontoparietal cortical neurons. The most prominent change, seen 3 weeks after STZ injection, was a significant enlargement of the Golgi apparatus caused by expansion of the trans-Golgi segment of the cellular protein secretory pathway. Morphometric analysis revealed that the area of the trans part of the Golgi complex in neuronal cells was increased more than two-fold (median values: 312 × 103 nm3 in 14 neurons from control animals, and 846 × 103 nm3 in 19 neurons from STZ-treated animals, P=0.0012), whereas that of the cis part did not significantly change. The effects of STZ did not resemble Golgi atrophy and fragmentation described in neurons from disease-prone brain structures of patients with Alzheimer's disease, but were similar to that observed after intravenous application of a non-metabolizable glucose analog 2-deoxyglucose. Considering that proamyloidogenic processing of beta-amyloid precursor protein may occur preferentially in the trans-Golgi segment, the observed early response of neuronal ultrastructure to desensitization of insulin receptors may predispose cells to form beta-amyloid deposits.",

    "abstract": "The present paper describes parvalbumin, calbindin-D28k and calretinin immunoreactivity in the claustrum and endopiriform nucleus of adult rabbits. Studied neuronal populations are characterized by morphological heterogeneity. Four types were identified in each subpopulation of cells containing calcium binding proteins on the basis of the number of processes and their branching pattern. There were no spatial differences in the distribution of cells containing either parvalbumin or calbindin-D28k in the claustrum and endopiriform nucleus. Well documented presence of the various projective zones in the rabbit claustrum did not reflect the specific distribution of neurons containing calcium binding proteins, except those containing calretinin. Their localization may correspond with the limbic zone. We have found that the rabbit claustrum and endopiriform nucleus have different pattern of parvalbumin and calretinin immunoreactivity. The former was more intense in the claustrum and the distribution of cell types was significantly different from that in the endopiriform nucleus. Calretinin-positive cells were observed in the claustrum, while in the endopiriform nucleus they were scarce. The distribution of neither calbindin-D28k-ir neurons nor fibers allowed differentiation of claustrum and endopiriform nucleus. Significant differences between the claustrum and endopiriform nucleus observed in the rabbit might be related with ontogenetic as well as other (functional) factors.",

Mice that were selected for over 108 generations for body weight at the postnatal (PN) day 21 were examined in the open field (OF) test and in the Lashley maze (LM) for their exploratory behavior and spatial learning. Light (L), heavy (C) and control (K) lines of mice in three age groups: PN21, PN-56 and PN-90, were tested once in the OF and three times in the LM. During the session in the OF the L mice displayed a steady increase of behavioral activity (sum of locomotion and rearing, climbing, sniffing, and grooming acts), whereas mice C and K habituated in the last stage. During entire session in the OF activity of the L mice was lower than that of the C and K mice. The L mice displayed high defecation/urination scores. In the learning task the L mice performed worse than the C and K mice. In conclusion, behavior of the L line was different from that of the two other lines: they showed higher anxiety and poorer spatial learning.",

Konorski and his friend and collaborator, Stefan Miller, distinguished instrumental conditioned reflexes as a separate type of acquired behavior, different from classical (Pavlovian) conditioned reflexes. In a series of pioneering studies Konorski demonstrated basic differences between the two types of conditioned reflexes. After the Second World War, he reinterpreted the results of research on conditioned reflexes on the basis of the mechanisms of Sherringtonian neurophysiology and introduced the term plasticity of the nervous system. His work, \"Conditioned reflexes and neuron organization\", published in 1948, signaled Konorski's place as one of the founders of contemporary neuroscience. He contributed significantly to the understanding of complex interactions of various classes of behaviors: innate and acquired, those driven by opposite motivations, and those elicited by cues signaling different contingencies. In his book \"Integrative activity of the brain\" (1967), Konorski analyzed the brain as a complex system directing the functioning of the organism as a whole.",

    "abstract": "Terotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is a monoamine neurotransmitter synthesized by the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase using 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) as a substrate. It was recently shown that serotonin and its precursor have powerful antioxidant properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of reduction in 5-HT levels by parachlorophenylalanine (pCPA) and their restoration by 5-HTP administration on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant status in rat brain. Serotonin levels were decreased by p-chlorophenylalanine administration. The effect of pchlorophenylalanine was counteracted by the intraperitoneal administration of 5-hydroxytryptophan. We evaluated the concentration of serotonin, malonyl dialdehyde and the status of antioxidants (GSH, catalase and superoxide dismutase) in brain. The results showed that p-chlorophenylalanine (300 mg/kg) induced a depletion of serotonin concentration and antioxidant status, as well as enhancing malonyl dialdehyde concentration in brain. The exogenous administration of 5-hydroxytryptophan prevented all effects induced by pchlorophenylalanine in brain tissue. The recovery of the neurotransmitter concentration in brain was related to the reduction of lipid peroxide generation and improved antioxidant status. In conclusion, our study supports the view that the antioxidant properties of serotonin protect against basal oxidative stress in brain.",

The thinking of each evolved with the progress of neuroscientific knowledge throughout the world, and save for Pavlov, each encountered governmental opposition to their views. Among the clues largely overlooked in their examination of conditional reflexes was the fact that the animal appreciates not only its own appetitive state but its immersion in the experimental setting. The latter in itself must require considerable, ongoing neuronal activity to sustain it. There is also the question as to whether \"motivation\" is an essential feature for the formation of conditional connections; and in cases where it is seemingly absent, as in recognition memory, the processes that underlie the astonishing efficacy of such memory formation remain almost wholly obscure. Finally, it is remarked that the cerebral cortex, as initially supposed, may indeed be the governing locus, even of such simple effects as habituation.",

TNF-α has been validated as a drug target with Remicade and Enbrel available as prescription medications. Both, however, are large macromolecules, require injection and have limited brain access. The classical drug, thalidomide is being increasingly used in the clinical management of a wide spectrum of diseases. As its clinical value in treating ENL derives from its TNF-α inhibitory activity, thalidomide was chosen for structural modification for the discovery of novel and more potent isosteric analogues with appropriate lipophilicity to insure high brain penetration. TNF-α inhibitory activity was evaluated against lipopolysacharide (LPS) stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in cell culture, whose viability was quantified to differentiate reductions in TNF-α secretion from that associated with cellular toxicity. Specific analogues potently inhibited TNF-α secretion, compared to thalidomide. This involved a post-transcriptional mechanism, as they decreased TNF-α mRNA stability via its 3'-untranslated region (UTR), as determined by luciferase activity in stably transfected cells with and without the 3'-UTR of human TNF-α.",

Therefore, the change of Aβ biology in Alzheimer's disease (as well as in a number of other human pathologies, including cardiovascular disease, neuromuscular junction disorders, NPC and Down's syndrome) may represent a physiological mechanism to compensate for impaired brain structure or function. In our own recent study Aβ1-40 rescued long term potentiation (LTP, a major model for activity-dependent CNS plasticity), while cholesterol synthesis inhibition abolished the restorative action of the Aβ peptide. This study confirms that Aβ protein is a functional player in synaptic structure-functional plasticity and in cholesterol neurochemical pathways. The article also calls for a need to critically re-evaluate a universal belief that transgenic mice with a transgene for amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) are a true model for Alzheimer's type neurodegeneration.",

However, at the neuronal level it is not yet clear how an increase in competition causes an increase of attentional effects. Recent neurophysiological data [Wegener et al., J Neurosci, 2004] demonstrated that attention serves to (1) keep neuronal selectivity on a high and constant level and (2) to protect selectivity within the attentional focus against degradation, as observed for neurons processing competing, nonattended objects.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the neural systems involved in lexico-semantic processing using fMRI. Activation patterns during perception of different visual forms were compared in Deaf native signers of British Sign Language (BSL) and hearing participants with no knowledge of SL or FS, who viewed these stimuli as meaningless gesture. The rationale was to identify linguistic and non-linguistic contributions to networks of activation, as well as differences related to input form. Right-handed volunteers underwent fMRI scanning while viewing lists of concrete nouns presented as different visual forms (written words, pictures, SL, FS). Patterns of activation evident for meaningful linguistic gesture (SL and FS) in signers could be distinguished from those for non-signers, specifically: left superior temporal cortex and left posterior inferior temporal regions (including the region often identified as the visual word form area in studies of reading) were activated more strongly in signers than non-signers by both SL and FS. Further group and task results will be reported.",

AD has been characterized by a significant serotoninergic impairment. It is well known that impaired serotoninergic function is related to aggressive behavior. We, herein, review the past and recent evidence that seems to link the serotoninergic system with aggressive manifestations in AD patients. Managing the aggressive behavior of these patients might be of significant medical, social and economical importance. However, there is still a long way to go until we verify the exact pathophysiological mechanism(s) involved in the induction of aggression in AD patients. The current data underlines a complex relationship between the observed serotoninergic impairment in AD patients and the (a) cholinergic system, (b) the endocrine (hormonal) state, (c) the nutritional habits, (d) the genetic background and (e) the caregiving environment.",

    "abstract": "Temporal specificity of latent inhibition of conditioned taste aversion (CTA) has been demonstrated after prolonged habituation to temporal contexts in the stages preceding conditioning, and it has been eliminated by restricting consumption during conditioning. However, it is not known if latent inhibition of CTA is still dependent on the temporal context when fluid consumption is limited in the stages prior to conditioning. We tested temporal specificity of latent inhibition in rats with (different time of day for the conditioning stage) and without (same time of day for pre-exposure and conditioning stages) temporal changes on the conditioning day. All animals had limited access to water in the morning sessions of the stages prior to the conditioning day and 15 min of free access to fluid in the evening sessions of these stages. Compared to animals without temporal changes between stages, animals with a different temporal context during conditioning did not show evidence of latent inhibition. Unlike the effects observed after taste stimulus restrictions during conditioning, these results suggest that the temporal specificity of latent inhibition of CTA is not abolished when access to water is limited in the stages preceding conditioning.",

    "abstract": "People prone to mood disorders and anxiety typically show increased sensitivity to task‑irrelevant stimulation signifying threat. Better knowledge about the brain mechanisms mediating this sensitivity as well as about individual inherited differences in how these mechanisms function is a precondition for developing improved vulnerability screening, resilience building and treatment methods. The chances to have affective disorders are known to depend, among other factors, on the functioning of the brain serotonin systems developed under influence from common genetic variability. However, the extent and directions of the effects of SNPs involved in serotonergic regulation on the propensity for suboptimal threat‑sensitivity are poorly understood. This applies also to HTR1A rs6295 polymorphism. Assisted by our custom developed emotional attentional blink task, we found that nonclinical subjects carrying the G allele (compared to C allele homozygotes) had higher sensitivity to threat‑depicting distractor stimuli, expressed as an increase in the blink magnitude. We also disrupted right‑hemisphere dorsolateral prefrontal cortex by rTMS (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation) to look for the possible role of DLPFC (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; known to be involved in cognitive control of responses to affective stimuli) in serotonergic regulation mediated by the HTR1A rs6295 polymorphism. No main effects or interactions with rTMS being involved were found.",

    "abstract": "Failure of extinction of fear-conditioned traumatic memory is the main pathology behind post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Functional and structural dysfunctions in the olfactory system are implicated by studies in PTSD patients. However, little is known regarding the neurobiological networks of trauma‑related odor sensitivity in PTSD. Male Wistar rats were exposed with a female cat for 10 min and long-term stress was evaluated by behavioral tests, containing open field (OF) and elevated plus maze (EPM). To prove the PTSD model, the serum level of cortisol was evaluated and compared with the control group. Local field potential (LFP) was applied to compare the electrophysiology of the OB in two groups. To assess neurogenesis, the expression of nestin, and doublecortin were evaluated. Data from EPM revealed a significant increase in spent time in the closed arms in PTSD group. We observed a significant reduction in OF parameters in terms of the total distance traveled, the time spent in the central zone, and the number of crossing the central zone in PTSD group compared to the control group. The mean serum cortisol level was significantly higher in the PTSD group than the control group. In LFP recording, the slope and the amplitude of field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) in the PTSD group were significantly higher than that of the control group. Our results also showed that the mRNA expression level of nestin as a neural progenitor marker and doublecortin, as an immature neuron marker, significantly decreased in the PTSD group compared to the control group. This study has shown that PTSD can disrupt the OB function through decreasing neurogenesis. More information on PTSD and OB would help us to establish a greater degree of accuracy on this matter.",

    "abstract": "Ascending projections of sacral spinal cord neurones (S1-S2) to the dorsal accessory olivary nucleus (DAO) were electrophysiologically investigated in 3 adult cats under deep alpha-chloralose anaesthesia. Antidromic action potentials were recorded extracellularly from 19 cells following stimulation of their axons in both the contralateral dorsal accessory olivary nucleus (coDAO) and the contralateral lateral funiculus at the level of lower thoracic segments (Th13). Two groups of neurones were identified in the gray matter of S1-S2 segments: one distributed in the medial part of Rexed’s laminae VI and VII (n = 5), the other located in the ventromedial part of lamina VIII (n = 14). Axonal conduction velocities of neurones investigated were comprised in the range 32-55 m/s. A significant decrease of conduction velocity was observed in each case when distal and proximal parts of the axon were compared. Our research confirmed anatomical data concerning spino-olivary neurones originating from sacral segments. However, we suggest that axons of this pathway give off collaterals to other spinal or supraspinal centres.",

    "abstract": "Carbon dioxide euthanasia is an established method for the termination of small laboratory animals. It has also been employed by the authors in neurobiological research on the post-mortem glutamate concentration in the structures of rat brains. The following investigations were aimed at optimizing the termination procedure based on the CO2 saturation rate of the inhaled air. Two rates of CO2 flow were applied, and the higher one significantly augmented the glutamate level in the hippocampus and cerebellum. The relationship between this finding and signs of central fear reaction is discussed. The authors conclude that lower rather than higher CO2 flow in euthanasia procedures is gentler and is therefore preferable for use with laboratory animals.",

    "abstract": "When, in the primeval sea, creatures first began to crawl, \"right\" and \"left\" came into being, yielding neuronal nets to control response to the sidedness of stimuli. In the half billion years of moving and sensing, two brains have evolved, the right and the left; and human experience now shows them to be roughly equivalent, potentially independent, conscious entities. This dramatic fact is evidenced by \"split-brain\" patients and by numerous cases of therapeutic removal of either hemisphere. Equally dramatic, of course, is that there is not the slightest sign of this duality in everyday experience, the right and left visual fields are seamlessly knit, and cross purpose is absent in the moment to moment operation of the two cerebral hemispheres. This unity is constantly synthesized by the 100,000,000 fibers passing from each hemisphere to the other; the vastness of that interchange emphasized upon comparison with the mere 1,000,000 fibers conveying all the visual world from each eye. With the large distances in the human brain some 100+ ms may commonly transpire for one hemisphere to send to and receive a response from the other. Efficiency thus demands that most neuronal calculation occur within rather than between hemispheres, thereby promoting differences in the characteristic capabilities of each alone, i.e., \"hemispheric specialization\". Despite this there is a bewildering bilaterality of activation revealed by fMRI for most cognitive tasks. In the absence of the forebrain commissures brainstem systems can be shown, in macaques, also to participate in the unification of behavioral result from the actions of the separated hemispheres. The system favors synthesis from congruent (visual) input to the two hemispheres; but in the face of incompatible hemispheric input, the two hemispheres are able to work out an accommodation in their control of subcortical systems.",

The in vitro pituitary hormone secretions were evaluated at basal rate for the first hour of incubation only, in Krebs Ringer phosphate (KRP) (I1) and after a second hour of incubation with KRP (I2) or with KRP+DA (I 2 plus DA). I1 PRL secretion was significantly higher in 33-day-old control and melatonin treated (MEL) rats as compared to I 2 periods. However, in 31-day-old rats I1 secretion was higher than in the I2 or I 2+DA periods, in MEL rats. In vitro GH secretion was significantly higher at I1 than during I 2 periods in the control 31- and 33-day-old groups, but not in MEL rats. The only significant effect of DA was the elevation of GH in prepubertal MEL rats. In vitro FSH release was increased by melatonin in 31-and 33-day-old female rats. No differences in PRL, GH and FSH secretion were found in adult rats. In conclusion, the results show that melatonin effects upon in vitro pituitary gland activity are reproductive-stage-dependent modifying the secretory capacity of the lactotrop, gonadotrop and somatotrop during prepubertal and pubertal ages but not in adult rats studied at a quiescent phase of the sexual cycle.",

Subjects reacted as fast as possible or with a defined time delay (from 250 to 750 ms) to a tone switching off by pressing a response-key with the left index finger (controlled by the right hemisphere) or with the right one (left hemisphere). For short delays (requested response times below 350 ms) variability of responses was much larger then for longer delays (above 350 ms), especially for the right hand. Thus, precise temporal control on consciously mediated actions sets only in after a rather long delay (in some cases after half a second). Neuronal mechanisms underlying conscious temporal control of actions appear to be different for the two hemispheres.",

    "abstract": "Studies of cortical network function on the basis of multiple single-neuron recordings have revealed neuronal interactions which depend on stimulus and behavioral context. These interactions exhibit dynamics on several different time scales, with time constants down to the millisecond range (Grun et al. 2002a,b, Gutig et al. 2002, 2003, Heck et al. 2002, Riehle et al. 1997, Vaadia et al. 1995). Mechanisms underlying such dynamic network organization are investigated by experimental and theoretical approaches. Our current research focuses on two interrelated aspects: precision and variability of cortical network activity (Arieli et al. 1996, Nawrot et al. 2000, 2003). Starting from previous model work (Diesmann et al. 1999, Gewaltig et al. 2001) in which we investigated conditions for the occurrence of precise joint-spiking events in cortical network activity, I will present recent findings from ongoing experimental and theoretical work in our laboratory (Heck et al. 2000, Hehl et al. 2001, Kuhn et al. 2002, 2003, 2004, Mehring et al. 2003), undertaken to test and expand some of the model predictions. Specifically, I will discuss new findings regarding the feasibility and constraints of precise synchronization dynamics in cortical networks, resulting from a critical evaluation of biological constraints from cortical connectivity and in vivo physiology, and dynamical constraints from large-scale network simulations.

Pre‑treatment with these cells was considered in the current study. SCs were injected into the right striatum in rats using the stereotaxic technique. Ten days after injection, middle cerebral artery occlusion surgery was performed. Following these procedures, neurological deficit scores, brain edema, blood‑brain barrier integrity, infarct volume, and the expression of apoptotic factors in the cortex, striatum, and piriform cortex‑amygdala were evaluated. Analysis showed that behavioral deficits, infarct volume, blood‑brain barrier permeability, and edema in the striatal area in the allograft group demonstrated a significant decrease compared to the control group. Additionally, analysis of the expression of caspase‑3 and Bcl‑2 proteins in the striatum indicated a remarkable reduction and increase, respectively, in the allograft group compared to the control group. According to the obtained results, one possible mechanism for the neuroprotection induced by SCs in an ischemic brain is the reduction of apoptotic factors.",

    "abstract": "Acetaminophen is one of the most widely used over‑the‑counter drugs worldwide for the treatment of pain and fever. Although acetaminophen use is known to impair hippocampus‑related learning and memory, its effect on anxiety is not clear. Insulin‑like growth factor‑1 (IGF‑1) and matrix metalloproteinase‑2 (MMP2) are important for cellular survival, maintenance and tissue integrity. The aim of this study was to investigate the dose‑dependent effects of acetaminophen on anxiety levels as well as on hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and liver tissue. Doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg acetaminophen were administered to male Sprague Dawley rats for 11 days and anxiety tests were conducted on the last day. Twenty‑four hours after the last acetaminophen administration, all animals were sacrificed and hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and liver tissues were removed for analyses. Hippocampal IGF‑1 and MMP2 levels were shown to decrease only at the highest dose of acetaminophen, which was accompanied by pathological changes in histology. The prefrontal cortex was not affected. Behavioral analyses also did not indicate changes in anxiety levels in the rats. Liver IGF‑1 and MMP2 levels decreased in all experimental groups. Serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels increased in the 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg acetaminophen groups. Our findings showed that varying doses of acetaminophen did not affect the prefrontal cortex or anxiety levels. Further research is needed to elucidate the hippocampal and hepatic protective roles of IGF‑1 and MMP2 in acetaminophen toxicity and their potential use in therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "Studies have previously demonstrated a relationship between social status and anxiety disorders such as panic disorder. Repeated episodes of panic attacks do not occur in combination with an actual fear stimulus or stressor. However, social ranking modulates the perception of the social signals of a threat or stressor. The hypothalamic nuclei are well‑known for their role in the elaboration of fear‑induced reactions. The dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) and the ventromedial hypothalamic (VMH) nuclei are hypothalamic subnuclei involved in the processing of threatening stimuli‑evoked aversive response and innate fear development. These structures are also located in the medial amygdala‑hypothalamus‑brainstem circuit that modulates innate fear‑induced defensive behaviors. This work aimed to investigate the relationship between social hierarchy and innate fear‑induced panic‑like responses in male rats. In our study, the dominance tube test was used to determine the social hierarchy. Then, DMH/VMH nuclei were unilaterally implanted with a guide cannula. After intra‑DMH/VMH injection of bicuculline (GABAA receptor antagonist), both innate fear induction and differences in dominant/subordinate rats were evaluated by the open field test. Intra‑DMH/VMH bicuculline increased the frequency of defensive immobility, forward escape movements, and crossing behaviors, as well as the duration of defensive immobility and forward escape movements in dominant rats. Subordinate rats showed a higher frequency of defensive attention, defensive immobility, and crossing than dominant rats. Additionally, dominant rats demonstrated a lower duration of defensive attention and defensive immobility than subordinate rats. Dominant rats seemed to adopt a form of innate‑fear characterized by increased proactivity with the environment. In contrast, subordinate rats exhibited a reactive form of innate‑fear characterized by passivity and freezing.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the role played by μ-opioid receptors located on LH neurons in defensive behaviour and unconditioned fear‑induced antinociception elicited by electric stimulation of LH. To achieve the goals, the μ1-opioid receptor selective antagonist naloxonazine was administered at different concentrations in the LH, and the defensive behaviour and fear‑induced antinociception elicited by electrical stimulation of LH were evaluated. The electrical stimulation of LH caused escape behaviour followed by defensive antinociception. Microinjections of naloxonazine in a concentration of 5.0 μg/0.2 μL in the LH decreased the aversive stimulus‑induced escape behaviour thresholds, but diminished defensive antinociception. These findings suggest that μ-opioid receptors of LH can be critical to panic attack‑related symptoms and facilitate the unconditioned fear‑induced antinociception produced by LH neurons activation.",

    "abstract": "Lithium is a mood stabilizer widely used in the pharmacotherapy of bipolar disorder and treatment‑resistant depression. Taking into account dysregulated inflammatory activity in depression and the immunomodulatory role of lithium, we hypothesized that genes associated with inflammatory responses may be potential biomarkers of lithium action. We aimed to compare gene expression changes between the brain and the periphery after chronic lithium administration in an animal model of depression. Depressive behavior was induced by chronic mild stress protocol for 4 weeks. After 2 weeks, rats started to receive lithium (study group) or water (reference group). The control group were rats not exposed to stress. Amygdala, hippocampus, frontal cortex and peripheral blood were analyzed using whole transcriptome expression microarrays. Changes were confirmed with qPCR and ELISA assay. After 2 weeks of lithium administration, we observed significant changes in gene expression between amygdala and peripheral blood. Logistic regression analysis determined Alox15 expression as a predictor of lithium status, as its expression was tissue‑specific and increased in amygdala and decreased in blood. Analysis of serum ALOX15 protein revealed its upregulation after two‑week lithium administration. Our study suggests that lithium may have therapeutic potential in depressive behaviors. These results indicate immunomodulatory effect of lithium and that Alox15 may be a new potential marker of chronic lithium treatment.",

On the basis of theoretical models and animal experiments, synchronized oscillatory neuronal activity is discussed as the key mechanism by which the brain binds information processed in different cortical areas to form a percept. Using an identical stimulation design - the same as used in animal studies - it was shown that induced gamma band responses in the EEG resemble the same features as those found in the intracortical recordings of animals. In addition, the present work demonstrates that these cortical activities are not higher harmonics of the alpha band and that they are sensitive to the features of the stimulus. These results support the notion that gamma band activity is not just a by-product of neuronal activity and that alpha- and gamma band activies most certainly represent different cortical functional states.",

    "abstract": "Focal epilepsy may be induced acutely in the brain in vivo by measures which reduce inhibition or enhance excitation. Athough the various models involve different mechanisms causing the epilepsy, their epileptiform discharge patterns vary only little. Intracellular analyses in vivo and in vitro reveal that the cellular hallmark of epileptic discharge, the paroxysmal depolarization shift, is followed by a giant hyperpolarization. The latter is comprised of several, overlapping, components with different durations, including calcium dependent potassium currents and GABA dependent inhibitions. Relative reduction of one inhibitory component is compensated by other inhibitory components. In epilepsy caused by reduction of GABAergic inhibition, the absolute duration and amplitude of GABAergic inhibition may even be increased in comparison to the responses following afferent stimulation under control conditions since the excitatory drive of the paroxysmal discharges on the interneurons is strongly increased. In some interictal discharge patterns, the enhanced inhibitions within the focus determine the refractory periods of the focus. The latter is paced by neurons from the perifocal area which show a shorter inibition associated with the interictal epileptic event. The discharge pattern of the focus may switch to other patterns, either spontaneously, or as entrained by external stimulation. Such changes are caused e.g. by progressive potassium accumulations in the extracellular space with critically small intervals of the epileptic events. It is concluded that the epileptiform discharge patterns reflect intrinsic properties of the brain, and do not very well reflect the mechanism of action of the epileptogenic model. The brain is thus equipped with inherent mechanisms which favor rhythmic epileptiform discharges under certain conditions.",

    "abstract": "Correlations between measures of attention and topographical abnormalities of evoked cortical potentials elicited during the Continuous Attention Test (CAT) were assessed in 50 schizophrenic patients, compared to 50 healthy subjects. For each group and for each CAT condition evoked responses consisted of six successive epochs (segments) of stable spatially configured potentials. Quantitative descriptors of those configurations (Lehmann 1987) were referred to the CAT data. In patients: (1) segments III-V were delayed, (2) in the non-target condition, diminished global field power (GFP) emerged, coexisting either with lower amplitude of posterior potentials in segment I and II or with lower amplitude of a central positive potential in segment V, (3) an altered topographic pattern of responses to the target stimulus occurred. In healthy subjects detection of the target (as compared to the non-target condition) was associated with a shift of the location of the positive potential in segments IV and V from a central towards the prefrontal area. In patients, in segment V a similar shift reached frontal, but not prefrontal areas, and additionally, the central areas remained active. Delayed latency and low GFP in segment V in the non-target condition in patients correlated with poor CAT performance. A more posterior location of the positive centroid in segment V during detection of the target correlated with better CAT results, and the associated GFP increase with less prolonged reaction time. The data revealed a possible compensatory role of central and frontal areas in the face of weakened prefrontal functions in schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "A specific temporal order of events at the cellular and molecular level occurs in response to injury to the brain. Injury-compromised neurons degenerate while surviving neurons undergo neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis to establish neuronal connectivity destroyed in the injury. Several genes, such as those coding cytoskeletal proteins and growth factors, have been shown to be regulated by AP-1 and NF-kappaB transcription factors, two of the most studied DNA binding regulatory proteins. Our laboratory has discovered that Fos-related antigen-2 from AP-1 transcription factor family and NF-kappaB p65 and p50 subunits are induced long-term (days to months) in the brain after neurotoxic, excitotoxic or ischemic insult. Fos-related antigen-2 is induced in neurons in several models of injury and its elevated expression lasts days to months, corresponding to the severity. The time-course of FRA-2 induction is abbreviated with less severe insult (terminal damage) relative to the cell death, but the induction occurs during the period of regeneration and repair in both models. NF-kappaB p65 is basally expressed in hippocampal and cortical neurons, but is elevated in reactive astrocytes in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex starting at two days and lasting at least two weeks after kainate treatment. Neurons of the hippocampus surviving ischemic or neurotoxic injury increase expression of NF-kappaB p50 for at least a week after injury, suggesting a function for p50 in neuronal survival and/or repair. The extended expression of these transcription factors implies a role in the activation of genes related to repair and regeneration, such as growth factors and synaptic proteins, after injury to the CNS.",

A food in the mouth, for example, evokes the gustatory percept and the percept of pleasure. However, affective percepts are unstable parts of cognitive-affective compounds. Five types of affective percepts are pain, fear, pleasure, \"desire\" and appetite in the broad sense of these words. Desire is evoked by inadequate pleasant stimuli. Affective percepts are \"lower\" or \"higher\". The latter are not directly associated with bodily needs. Esthetic and social percepts are higher, for example. Although pain and pleasure are essentially innate, they can be modified by sensory experience. Alimentary and esthetic preferences and social values are modifiable, for example.

In addition, avoidance actions protect from the signaled pain, optimization actions increase the existing pleasure and approach actions provide the signaled pleasure. Thus, voluntary actions associated with different percepts occur according to one universal principle. Voluntary actions are \"internal\" and behavioral.

Four days after ischemia a small but insignificant decrease of [35S]TBPS binding to synaptic plasma membranes (SPM) was observed in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex as compared to control. The effect of ischemia was larger and statistically significant after the first and second month of reperfusion, constituting 20% inhibition of [35S]TBPS binding to SPM of sham-operated gerbils. On the other hand, the half-life of fast phase [35S]TBPS dissociation four days after ischemia was markedly diminished by about 40%–50% as compared to its control value and persisted during the first and second month of reperfusion in the hippocampal SPM. A similar but less potent reduction of the half-life of the fast phase of [35S]TBPS dissociation (about 30% versus control) appeared one and two months after ischemia in cerebral cortex SPM. One month after ischemia muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake into cerebral cortex synaptoneurosomes was lowered as compared with control uptake, but remained statistically insignificant in the whole range of muscimol concentrations tested. Our results indicated that ischernia-reperfusion injury significantly decreases opening time of GABAA receptor-gated Cl- channels in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, which may lower the hyperpolarization ability of this receptor complex leading to an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter pathways in these brain areas, and in consequence to neuronal dysfunction or degeneration.",

    "abstract": "In view of the data indicating that insulin can modify penetration of some drugs across cell membranes and tissue barriers, particularly the blood-brain barrier, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of insulin on both the anticonvulsant activity and the brain concentration of carbamazepine in mice suffering from seizures induced by maximal electroshock. The antiepileptic drug was administered per os in single doses either alone or in combination with insulin given as single intraperitoneal injections. To assess the anticonvulsant activity of carbamazepine the ED50 values were calculated. The results indicate that insulin given in doses up to 2 units/kg did not affect the convulsive threshold, whereas insulin applied at 2 units/kg led to a significant reduction in the anticonvulsant activity of carbamazepine, as judged by an increase in the ED50 value from 16.2 to 41.3 mg/kg. This effect was accompanied by the marked reduction in both the brain and blood concentrations of the drug. It is likely, therefore, that the inhibitory activity of insulin on the anticonvulsive function of carbamazepine is related not only to the effect of the former on the blood-brain transport of the latter, but also to insulin-induced modulation of the serum concentration of the drug.",

The type of the surface, the position of an area devoid of dots (the gap) and the type of gap edges was varied. The local orientation of the interpolated surfaces was estimated by a method of adjustment. The results show that the interpolated surfaces possessed less depth than the simulated ones. The type of the surface and the position of the gap had a significant effect on the performance. The worst results were obtained for a surface with orientation discontinuity (dihedral angle) where not only the shape of the interpolated surface differed significantly from the simulated one but the variability of the estimates was largest as well. The type of the gap edges did not affect the performance. The results are discussed in relation to the algorithms of surface interpolation.",

Observations both at the cellular level in vitro and at the behavioural level in vivo suggest that altered recognition molecule expression can lead to changes in synaptic efficacy, and alterations in synaptic function in turn evoke changes in recognition molecule expression. These changes can manifest themselves as morphological alterations and modulations of the synapse's signal transduction machinery.",

    "abstract": "Cholinergic neurons, unlike other brain cells utilize acetyl-CoA not only for energy production but also for acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis. Therefore,, suppression of acetyl-CoA metabolism by different neurotoxic inputs may be particularly harmful for this group of cells. Differentiation of SN56 cholinergic hybrid cells increased their choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity and ACh content but depressed pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and acetyl-CoA content. Differentiated cells were more susceptible to acute and chronic influences of aluminum, NO and amyloid-β. Al decreased acetyyl-CoA content, ACh release and increased Ca accumulation in differentiated cells (DC) to much higher degree than in non-differentiated ones (NC). NO strongly depressed acetyl-CoA level and increased ACh release in DC but did not affect NC. Additive effects of Al and NO were seen in DC but not in NC. Also long term suppressory effects of amyloid-β, Al and NO on cholinergic phenotype and morphologic maturation were more evident in DC than in NC. Thus, relative shortage of acetyl-CoA in highly differentiated cholinergic neurons could make them particulary susceptible to degenerative insults in the course of different cholinergic encephalopathies.",

    "abstract": "The ontogeny of the digestive capacities in fish is species-specific and its knowledge is essential for understanding the nutritional requirements of fish larvae. While the Amazon basin contains the world's highest fish biodiversity, the molecular basis of the early digestive physiology has not yet been reported in any Amazonian fish species. In order to increase basic knowledge on the molecular ontogeny of the digestive system of a commercially important Amazonian fish species, six digestive enzyme genes (?-amylase, phospholipase A2, lipoprotein lipase, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and pepsin) were isolated and identified, and their expression analyzed from 3 to 24 days post fertilization (dpf) in Pseudoplatystoma punctifer, a catfish species with high potential for aquaculture diversification. The present results, together with those previously obtained on the development of the digestive enzyme activity, showed that gene expression and enzymatic activities are synchronized and that the enzymatic machinery of P. punctifer was completely prepared for the onset of exogenous feeding (4 dpf, 6 mm total length, TL) and had reached its maturity between 10 and 13 dpf (11-14 mm TL). This indicated that the transition from the larval to the juvenile mode of digestion had been completed and they were suitable for weaning under culture conditions. Furthermore, the gene expression analyses suggest that this species displays an omnivorous behavior with a preference towards carnivory during early development. The present study provides the first comprehensive ontogenetic analysis of the digestive function from a molecular point of view of a species of the genus Pseudoplatystoma, and contributes to the development of feeding strategies in the context of South American aquaculture diversification.",

Therefore, we assessed whether c‑fos expression changes in fed, fasting, and refed animals and how scopolamine treatment affects these changes. We further assessed whether there is a change in c‑fos expression after convulsions. For this purpose, BALB/c mice fasted for 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h periods were used. The animals were treated with saline or scopolamine. Half\\r\\nof the animals treated with saline or scopolamine were given food 20 min after injection. All animals were observed for development of convulsions for 30 min. At the end of this period, the brains of all animals were removed, and the percentage of c‑fos active cells in the hypothalamus was determined immunohistochemically. Convulsions occurred within 1‑48 h of fasting, after scopolamine treatment and re‑feeding. Compared to fed animals, c‑fos expression was not significantly changed in those undergoing different fasting periods, but significantly decreased after 12 h fasting. After animals were allowed to eat, c‑fos activation significantly increased in the 1, 3, 6 and 12 refed‑saline groups and decreased in the 48 refed‑saline group. Scopolamine treatment in 1‑24 h fasted animals increased c‑fos expression, but decreased in 48 h fasted animals. Whereas convulsion development in scopolamine‑treated 3, 6, 12 and 24 h refed animals suppressed c‑fos expression. These results demonstrate that re‑feeding and scopolamine treatment induces neuronal activity in the hypothalamus, while scopolamine induced convulsions after food intake suppressed the c‑fos activity.",

We have used Karhunen-Loeve decomposition of the covariance matrix of the EEG signal to analyse EEG signals of 4 healthy subjects, under drug-free condition and under the influence of Diazepam. We found that what we call KL-complexity of the signal differs profoundly for the signals registered in different EEG channels, from about 5–8 for signals in frontal channels up to 40 and more in occipital ones. But no consistency in the influence of Diazepam administration on KL-complexity is observed. We also estimated the embedding dimension of the EEG signals of the same subjects, which turned to be between 7 and 11, so endorsing the presumption about existence of low-dimensional chaotic attractor. We are sure that nonlinear time series analysis can be used to investigate the dynamics underlying the generation of EEG signal. This approach does not seem practical yet, but deserves further study.",

Stimulating electrodes were placed bilaterally at levels of lower thoracic and sacral segments and in the lateral reticular nucleus (LRN), ipsilaterally to the recording sites in C6/C7 segments. Thirty-nine out of a total one hundred neurones could be classified as bidirectional neurones with both descending and ascending collaterals. In the remaining cases only long descending projections to spinal segments were found. Comparison of conduction velocities measured in descending branches revealed no significant differences between individual neurones. On the other hand, descending collaterals of double direction neurones conducted impulses considerably faster than their axonal branches ascending to LRN. Our results suggest that parallel transmission of information to various, spinal or supraspinal centres of the nervous system is more common than reported before.",

Single electrodes were implanted in the lateral hypothalamus and the ability of each electrode to support self-stimulation and stimulation-induced feeding was evaluated at four current levels between 80 and 320 microA. The frequency thresholds associated with each current value were assessed following four intraperitoneal doses of bombesin, 2, 4, 8, and 16 micrograms/kg, as well as a saline dose. Bombesin increased the thresholds for stimulation-induced feeding at doses known to reduce food intake without influencing self-stimulation thresholds. From these findings we conclude that (1) the effects of peripheral bombesin on stimulation-induced feeding are analogous to its effects on normal feeding and (2) the data provide additional evidence for a pharmacological dissociation between stimulation-induced feeding and reward.",

    "abstract": "Caffeine in 10(-2) M concentration per se activates ryanodine receptors (RyR) in vitro, thereby increasing the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i). In general opinion, caffeine applied in vivo in much lower doses does not affect [Ca2+]i in neurones. However, it was recently demonstrated that caffeine in low concentrations in vitro potentiates evoked Ca2+ release in neurones via RyR. Microdialysis of the rat dentate gyrus (DG), combined with measurement of 45Ca2+ efflux, has been used in our laboratory to study in vivo NMDA-evoked calcium induced calcium release (CICR) via RyR. The aim of the present microdialysis study was to investigate in vivo effects of caffeine, applied systemically in a pharmacologically-relevant dose, and locally in the dialysis medium in very high concentration, on the NMDA-evoked CICR in DG neurones. To ensure steady brain concentration of caffeine, its systemic (i.p.) administration in a dose of 40 mg/kg was followed by a continuous i.p. infusion of 80 micropgrams/kg/min and application of 0.4 mM caffeine in the dialysis medium. The results demonstrated that in the rat DG, local administration of 50 mM caffeine significantly stimulates a spontaneous 45Ca2+ efflux and its release induced by 5 mM NMDA. However, systemic administration of caffeine had no effect on spontaneous and NMDA-induced 45Ca2+ release in the rat DG, which supports the view that caffeine, applied in vivo, even in high doses, does not influence CICR in brain neurones.",

A mild compression spinal cord injury was performed in two experimental models. The first model was used to assess the disappearance and the second one the return of the electrophysiological spinal cord function after injury. In the first experimental model typical changes in waveforms morphology from normal to isoelectric line during spinal cord compression were investigated. In the second model an isoelectric line was achieved by more severe but a shorter time of compression and the typical changes in SEPs morphology after decompression were described. Our evidence suggests that the spinal cord function disappears gradually during mild compression and can return early after decompression. The amplitude after decompression first improved and then gradually deteriorated which is probably caused by secondary insult. Experimental models are both effective and simple and may be used to evaluate the effect of treatment of spinal cord injuries.",

We describe two nuptial flights observed in a laboratory colony of P. laboriosa at a 3 days interval. They both occurred in the morning while the nest was kept in near darkness (less than 2 lux of daylight). Flying activity of the alates was suppressed within 1 h by their exposure to daylight of about 140 lux, and within several minutes by their exposure to a lamp emitting white light of 3,000 lux and acting as a source of heat. On the day following the first flight the alates and the workers showed exceptionally high level of mutual grooming. The alates, in particular the males, were transported by workers to the brood chambers whenever they strayed outside and after the nuptial flights.",

    "abstract": "The experiments were performed on 9 cat and 18 rat isolated stellate ganglia. Rats and cats were anesthetized with alpha-glucochloralose or urethane, respectively. The ganglia, isolated with their branches, were transferred to a recording chamber and constantly superfused with artificial extracellular fluid bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Branches of the ganglion were one by one placed in suction electrodes and stimulated. Antidromic evoked potentials were systematically recorded from numerous points on the ganglion surface. The area under the curve of the negative wave of each recorded potential was considered proportional to the number of neurons located in the vicinity of the recording electrode, projecting to the stimulated nerve. We have found that: (1) cardiac sympathetic neurons are located in the lower, caudal half of the ganglia; (2) vertebral sympathetic neurons occupy the cranial, upper half of the ganglia; (3) neurons with axons in the ansae are positioned near the point of exit of the respective ansa from the ganglion; (4) localization of neurons projecting to the same branches is very similar on both sides--right and left; (5) this localization is also similar in rats compared to cats.",

An increase of the intracellular content of palmitoylcarnitine in neuroblastoma NB-2a cells after administration of carnitine was correlated with an inhibition of cell proliferation and a concomitant promotion of differentiation processes. The activity of protein kinase C was measured in vivo, with cells permeabilized through the use of streptolysin O and a peptide substrate. Palmitoylcarnitine inhibited the phorbol ester stimulated reaction of the peptide phosphorylation in a concentration dependent way. The degree of protein kinase C inhibition was correlated with intracellular increase of the palmitoylcarnitine content, pointing to this compound as a natural modulator of protein kinase C activity.",

MR examination allows to estimate the activity of the disease on the basis of the presence of oedema around the plaques and their contrast enhancement with gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA). 17.8% of all cases showed the signs of the acute phase of MS. About one-third of all cases were accompanied by cortical brain atrophy (the most often seen in frontal lobes), subcortical brain atrophy was less frequent (one-sixth). In about two-third of all cases the corpus callosum atrophy was found. The analysis of follow-up MR examinations of 83 patients taking part in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of a new immunosuppressive drug cladribine showed that patients from the placebo group were more compliant to any changes of the plaques. Decrease of the plaques size was found mainly in women. No correlation between the patients age and the plaques changes was established.",

The second group was composed of neurones (20 cells) with irregular (IR) configurations of receptive fields. Some neurones (16 cells) of this group had relatively simple spatial configurations of receptive fields and 4 neurones had receptive fields with more intricate spatial configurations which formed complex geometrical shapes in the visual field. The exploration of the distribution of response properties a to stationary flashing spot over the RF surface revealed that the majority of cells with regular receptive fields have heterogeneous stationary structure with ON, ON-OFF and OFF subregions sequentially located in the receptive field, and these neurones, as a rule, were direction-sensitive. The neurones with irregular receptive fields, on the other hand, had a rather homogeneous structure of RFs when tested by a stationary flashing spot and only four neurones of 20 investigated were directionally sensitive.",

Sodium removal partially inhibited kainate's effect. Quisqualate also produced influx of 45Ca2+, but with lower efficacy and higher potency than kainate. This action of quisqualate was unaffected by CPP and by sodium removal. Preincubation of cells with the plant lectin concanavalin A (Con A), but not with its succinyl derivative, enhanced quisqualate-induced calcium influx, and to a lesser extent kainate's effect. Inclusion of quisqualate in preincubation medium antagonized Con A potentiation of quisqualate response. Also Con A was ineffective when included in the incubation medium only, without preincubation. Preincubation of rat brain cortical membranes with Con A but not with succinyl Con A increased the binding of the AMPA receptor agonist, [3H]alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid ([3H]AMPA). The results suggest that Con A enhancement of quisqualate response possibly involves the modification of an AMPA recognition site and requires preincubation in the absence of an agonist (here quisqualate).",

The target's initial movement period was either 2 or 3 seconds. The following parameters were studied: time on-target intervals, time off-target intervals, number of tracking errors, heart rate and tracking error incidence over the cardiac cycle. Time on-target intervals were longer for the velocity guided tasks than for the size guided ones. The same was true for time off-target intervals. Values for both types of intervals decreased gradually over the fixed sequence of tasks for velocity but not for size guided tasks. Heart rate was higher in the size guided task.

The present study was designed to ascertain whether 5-HT challenge into the laryngeal artery will evoke the full constellation of this chemoreflex and to examine the role of laryngeal sensory input and importance of vagal afferents in the respiratory sequelae. The experiments were done on 10 anaesthetized, spontaneously breathing cats. Laryngeal artery injections of 5-HT, similarly to intravenous challenge, caused apnoeas, which were significantly diminished by the section of cervical vagal trunks. Breathing frequency increased in all conditions on intravenous injection but only prior to vagotomy, when administered into laryngeal artery. With resumed breathing, the peak inspiratory airflows were significantly increased in the neurally intact, those treated by bilateral section of the superior laryngeal nerves (SLNs-cut) and vagotomized cats, with no difference between them and independent of the route of injection. The results show that serotonin chemoreflex could evolve from the laryngeal vascular bed and that laryngeal afferents do not contribute to the respiratory arrest.",

The chick pineal gland showed high HA levels (12.19 and 13.09 ng/pineal at Land D, respectively). The t-MeHA content of chick pineal gland was about 20-times lower than HA level (650.2 and 536.4 pg/pineal at L and D, respectively). An amino acid precursor of HA, L-histidine (1 g/kg, ip), given to chicks during L or D significantly increased both HA and t-MeHA content of the pineal gland. The L-histidine-evoked elevations in HA level were 2–4-times higher than changes in t-MeHA content. Enzymatic study showed the presence in chick pineal of a moderate activity of L-histidine decarboxylase (HDC), and well expressed activity of HA-methyltransferase (HMT), HA synthesizing and inactivating enzyme, respectively, which suggests that both HA and t-MeHA may be produced within the gland. It is suggested that the metabolic dynamics of the pineal HA may be higher during lighthours than darkhours of the daily light dark illumination cycle.",

These may be detected by spike-triggered averaging, cross correlation or coherence analysis. The specificity of this type of evidence has been investigated by cross-correlating the activity of identified cutaneous vasoconstrictor postganglionic fibres with that of medullary premotor neurones of like and of unlike functional type, as determined by physiological testing (preoptic warming), in anaesthetised cats. Single medullary premotor neurones of both types were recorded from the subretrofacial nucleus: they were identified by their barosensitivity and, in most cases, their spinally projecting axons. By the test criteria chosen, the correlation method gave both false-positive and false-negative results as commonly as it gave correct ones. We conclude that it is not a reliable way to determine brainstem-postganglionic connectivity.",

Since NGF exerts its effects via p75NTR and TrkA receptors coexpressed in vast majority of these neurones and down-regulated without NGF treatment after injury, in this study we aimed to examine how does the lesion to the cholinergic tracts affect distribution of both types of receptor proteins in damaged fibres. Early changes (two and seven days) were examined immunocytochemically within the septum and supracallosal stria after unilateral lesion to the supracallosal area and cingulum transecting some septal cholinergic efferents. We found accumulation of p75NTR and TrkA immunoreactive material (so-called \"pile-up\") within axonal segments of distended appearance proximal to the transection at two days postlesion and its translocation towards cell bodies seven days postsurgery. We observed p75NTR pile-up to be more intense than TrkA, which may indicate different cellular concentrations of both receptors. Receptor pile-up resembled acetylcholinesterase pile-up reported previously, suggesting a common response mechanism involving axonal transport disturbances.",

Sphingosine had a direct effect on changes in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration only when applied at a high concentration of 100 microM, causing the cytosolic Ca2+ level to rise. However, at a much lower concentration of 15 microM sphingosine diminished calcium responses triggered by thapsigargin (a specific inhibitor of calcium pump in the endoplasmic reticulum) and ionomycin (calcium ionophore). Since responses to thapsigargin and ionomycin were blocked in Ca2+-free medium, we postulate that sphingosine is acting on the intracellular calcium stores. Additionally, sphingosine (at 15 microM and 100 microM) markedly decreases thapsigargin-induced sustained elevation in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, indicating its inhibitory effect on thapsigargin-evoked Ca2+ influx. Sphingosine is a known inhibitor of protein kinase C and the involvement of this enzyme is postulated in the modulatory effects of sphingosine on intracellular calcium dynamics.",

Before the injection cross-correlogram shapes and numbers did not differ in young and adult cats, whereas PSTHs differed dramatically. Glu iontophoresis typically elevated background PSTHs levels rather than peak responses in young kittens. In adult animals the opposite effect predominated. After the termination of iontophoresis visual responses were enhanced in 21% of kitten neurones. In adult cats this effect was not observed. In kittens, a clear increase of cross-correlogram strength was recorded in one neuronal pair (3.6%) after the injection terminated. In adult cats similar effect was also found in 3% of pairs.",

In the deafferented pons the EEG activity was virtually absent, whereas the spatial density of active units and the rate of their spontaneous spike activity were at a high level. In the pons of control preparations with brainstem transected only at the ponto-midbrain junction the EEG activity was present, while the single-unit activity was such as in the isolated pons. The electrical activity of the isolated pons was similar to that previously described in the cat's isolated midbrain. The discrepancy between EEG and single-unit activity suggests that in the deafferented pons or midbrain many neurones are asynchronously autoactive. Also, these results show that a flat EEG record is not necessarily a sign of absence of the neural activity and neural death.",

The results indicate that the majority of the investigated neurones changed their responses essentially at the gradual increase of size of the applied stimuli (i.e. showed negative or positive summation). Particularly, direction non-sensitive neurones showed symmetrical changes of spatial summation curves in response to two opposite directions of movement. By contrast, in some direction sensitive neurones different characteristics of responses for the two opposite directions of movement were observed. Thus the number of discharges in the responses to the preferred direction could increase or decrease at the gradual increase of the moving stimulus size, while the responses to the null direction could remain stable or vice versa. The same was observed for the \"ON\" and \"OFF\" responses in the ON-OFF neurones. Thus, it appears that the pattern of responses of a given neurone to different directions of movement and to the \"on\" and \"off\" periods of stationary stimulation are shaped by independent mechanisms.",

At autopsy intraspinal angioma (C2-D6) and diastematomyelia (D11-lumbar segments) were found. Beside, intraspinal hemorrhage was present. Morphological examination of posterior and anterior spinal roots as well as peripheral nerves was done. Spheroids, axonal degeneration and prominent loss of myelinated fibers were observed in the proximal parts of the spinal roots. Axonal degeneration of myelinated fibers and regenerated fibers were noted in the distal parts of spinal roots and in peripheral nerves. Abnormal, fetal-like vessels were present in the spinal roots. Two mechanisms of acute and chronic changes (transneuronal and Wallerian degeneration) are discussed.",
